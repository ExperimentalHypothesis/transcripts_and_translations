Public Program. Toronto (Canada), 5 October 1993.

[Tape began in mid-sentence] You cannot change it, you cannot transform it, you cannot conceptualize it, unfortunately, at this human state you cannot know it. Whatever today I'm going to tell you, you have to listen to it, please don't believe blindfolded. Keep your mind open as a scientist. If it is proved, then as honest people you have to believe, because it is for your benevolence, it is for the benevolence of your country, it is for the benevolence of the whole world.

So, what is the truth? The truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this ego and you are not these conditionings. Because you always say this is my, mine, it is my body, my conditionings, my ego. Who is this my, who is this I, who owns all these things? So the truth is you are not these things but you are the pure Spirit. The second truth is that there is an All Pervading Power of divine love which does all these miraculous things like creating these flowers, out of one seed. All the living work is done by this All Pervading Power of Divine love. In Sanskrit we call it as Paramchaitanya, Bramachitana, in the Koran it is described as Ruh. In every religion it is describe that there is the All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

We have never felt it in our human awareness. We have reached up to a point of human awareness, but still in this evolutionary process, we have to move and break through has to take place by which you get your connection with this All Pervading Power. Unless and until you are connected with this All Pervading Power, you have no relations with divine or with God Almighty. There are many people who tell Me that, Mother we pray every day, and we do this, we do that, still we are so sick, still we are so suffering; what's the problem?. I say, you are to be connected. If the telephone is not connected, what's the use of telephoning?

On the contrary, the telephone gets into jeopardy. Same see, this instrument is here it is a very good example that unless and until it is connected to the mains, it has no meaning, it has no identity, it does not know why it is there. In the same way, we have seen the science growing so much all over, such a big civilization has grown out of science. But it does not know its roots. It is amoral. Science is amoral and cannot answer many questions like: Why are we on this earth? Why we came as human beings? It cannot answer.

So we have to turn to something deeper and greater, and that state is what we call as Self Knowledge, the inner knowledge. We have not known the inner knowledge of our being. Whatever we suffer or whatever are the global problems are mostly because of something wrong with our centers, as they must have explained to you. These centers are there, they are subtle centers of energy, and when something goes wrong with them, we'll suffer physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. If by any means we can put these centers right, we should feel all right. Apart from that, we should achieve the state which is of Self Realization, of self knowledge.

Is promised by many scriptures that such a time of resurrection is there, that is today, and many are to be resurrected. It's a very funny idea, which was I don't know why it was put forward in many books that at the time of resurrection, we'll all come out of our graves. I mean imagine, what is left in the graves is maybe some few bones. Is not so. It's actually at this special blossom time I call it, at this time many will be born, many, who are seekers and who want their realization. Many people will be born, again their souls will take forms. That's why we have population problems in some countries and in some countries we have minus. I mean, the population can never grow to such an extent that it will outsize this world. But despite that we are worried about population. This population is there mostly because these are very important times, and at this time people are going to get their resurrection.

This is all promised that people will get their resurrection. In Koran they have described that Twelve Mahadhi will come and he will give realization. In the Hindu scriptures it is written, Indian scriptures, that there they will be a Kalaki who will give you realization, who will resurrect you and all kind of books there are, in the Bible also we have this. So, one has to realize that if it is such an important time, and at this time we are born, we should understand our purpose of our being here at this time. But human beings are really lost into lots of illusions, Bhranti they call it. Because that's the specialty of this times, also, that at this time, people will get into illusions and will be confused. Confusion will be there as a result of that they will start seeking. But in this confusion sometimes we completely lose our logic and we start falling into wrong things.

For example, Toronto, they were saying that, people come, Mother, just to meet You and after that they don't come. I said, "It is very surprising, they come to meet Me but they must grow, they have to grow. They have to understand what they are. They have to learn what is so important. Not only that but they have to be so mature that they can use their power to enlighten other people. Is the responsibility of every person who gets his realization to mature and to give realizations to others."

But I was told, I was surprised, that some people come here, as gurus from India or some sort of evangelist and all that and people get enamored by them. First of all you cannot pay for your evolution. You cannot. God doesn't understand money. He does not understand banking, he doesn't, you cannot pay. Anybody who takes money you should shun that person. The other day I happened to be in India, I don't know by chance, in a place of one Mr. Morari Bapu and I was amazed. He had created one Sri Rama, of seven, twelve years of age, and about seven years of Sitaji, and he was saying they are going to get married now, so you all should give the trousseau. So all the ladies, Marwadis and Gujeratis started taking out their bangles of diamonds, and this and that and gave it. I started wondering, what's the matter with these people, have they no brains, how could they give money to a man who is marrying some fake Rama and Sita?

Another time, I mean, today I have to tell you because, I was surprised that in this place which I find very evolved and intelligent, people are following such nonsense which they have stopped in other places. Then another is this TM business, the other day somebody was ask Me what about the power of mind, it is limited, and he makes one pendulum move, you see, with the mind. Are you here to move a pendulum? Is that your value? Is that what you are here on this earth? Have you no respect of your being that you go to such stupid people and listen to them, and pay it. How can it be? Just think, moving the pendulum you paid three hundred pounds. In any way you can move it. All kinds of stupid things are being done.

Now this is Mr. Satya Sai Baba recently has been completely exposed by cameras. And they saw him getting this gold chain, I have got the tape also, chain like this and moving like this. Why should God give you gold chain? Or diamonds? Is that what God wants you to have? Those who have diamonds are all godly people? How could people take to such stupid things, I can't understand. And it is still on, on and on. Must use your brains. Then somebody has a home or a havan; this is Indian nonsense. So they must give they are so ... I mean, I dedicate it to God. Now, in the name of God, this home, let's pay. Who are the people who are doing? What have they achieved? What is their private life? How do they live? What is their bona fide from where have they come, they might have come from jail? And wearing those dresses are just befooling you. Any nonsensical thing comes in if you want to accept.

Then, Sahaja Yoga is not meant for stupid and idiots, I can tell you this. It is meant for people who have some sense in their head, to understand what is the value of their life. Why are they on this earth? This is the category of people whom I call as the people who are seekers. Whom William Blake* has called as the men of God, who will come on this earth, and they will become divine, and they'll make others divine. You want to be make people divine, you want to be divine; you don't want to waste your energy on such stupid things. You have done it, so many years. All kind of things you have been doing in the name of God.

Why, even Catholic Church you know that they counterfeited nine hundred, nine million dollars or something like that, counterfeited from their own Vatican bank that distributed it. Is this the job of any saintly person? They are raping women; they are doing all kind of nonsense. How can it be? There's no divinity of any kind. On the contrary, I think they are like devils. Now also in England, I was surprised, the Canon of the Protestant Church, I was born in a protestant family. I'm amazed that he says that you have to allow extra-marital relationships, because people are not coming to church, because people must come to church and pay these priests. If they had something substantial, if they had something valuable, they wouldn't have to go to this, then they will say, now you must allow child abuse, drug addiction, everything, why not? For getting cheap popularity.

It depends on our understanding and on our seeking. What are we seeking? We are seeking our second birth, our transformation. We have to have our inner knowledge, we have to know ourselves and we have to grow into it, this is the value of your life. That's why you are born today, you might have forgotten your previous lives, your struggles, your seeking; whatever you might have forgotten, but I am telling you today, verily, verily, that you have taken birth on this earth to become the Spirit and to grow into it. As a result, what happens? When you become the Spirit, first of all, your attention gets enlightened, enlightened. In the sense that with your attention you can feel the centers of all the people, also you know about your own centers. As I told you that, most of the problems are coming from these centers. Now if you know how to correct these centers, you solve your problem and you solve the problem of others. So we say that in your awareness, which is human awareness, first of all you develop the consciousness or what we call as bodh, means on your central nervous system you can know the absolute truth.

Now supposing somebody as I said coming from India, from jail just now, he said, "Better let's go to Toronto with a funny dress, I'll say that I am such and such guru coming from Himalayas." If he thinks like that, and if he comes here, how will you make him out? How will you know whether he is a thief or not? Absolute truth. Many people who are atheists, who don't believe in God, if they ask after Realization is there God? They get the blessings of this All Pervading Power and they start feeling cool breezes in their hands. You can make out the diseases of other people on your finger tips, because your fingers are the endings of the sympathetic nervous system and they can feel what's wrong with which one. Guru Nanaka has clearly said, I have a big chapter about it, that there will be such and such time we called Spanjarao. I can't understand that, what are we seeking and what are we at?

We are seeking to be the Truth, to be re-born, to be Atmasakshatkari, to be yogis. That is, united with this All Pervading Power, not the physical yoga in which you have to stand on your head. Many people think that if you stand on your head, you will get connected to God, but there are many like that also. I mean, it is some times if you hear the way people believe in things, you sometimes feel you are in a lunatic asylum. We have to really raise ourselves and see that our purpose of life is very, very great.

This is the most historical times. At this time you are born here, you have to become the Spirit. Your attention gets enlightened by which you know on your fingers tips your own centers and the centers of others. You know the absolute truth, but, that is not the end of it, you discover your peace within yourself. If I say now, you stand in your present, you cannot. We live either in the future or in the past.

In the center, between these two, there is the present. A thought rises within us, from say from the past or from the future again goes to another thought. So we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts, but when this happens these thoughts elongate and we are in present. That's what happens that we become thoughtlessly aware, in Sanskrit it is called Nirvichara Samadhi, thoughtlessly aware, without any difficulty, without any problem, you just become thoughtlessly aware and you become peaceful.

People talk of peace, I know, I've met many who have got awards of peace, but they are such hot tempered people, I tell you, that if you are to talk to them, keep a barge pole in between, it's terrible, how can they get peace awards, I can't understand? On what grounds they get peace awards the person who doesn't have peace within themselves? How can they have peace award? But they have, they get it, somehow or other this is modern world, you know. So the peace within is established and you watch the whole world as a drama, as a witness.

You see the whole world as just not to be involved with, supposing you are in the water, then you are afraid of the waves, but supposing you get into the boat, then you watch, and enjoy the waves. But supposing you know how to swim, then you jump in and save others, these are the two stages into which you pass. First you get your thoughtless awareness, and the second one is the stage which we call doubtless awareness. Now some people may say, how many days, how many times? Some people jump in immediately, some people takes, some time, but within one month I've seen people becoming experts, absolutely experts. So you become your own master, and you become the complete master of the divine laws. You understand how they work, it's very simple, has to be. It is so vital today it has to be extremely simple, like breathing. If you have to breath, and go read books or pay money to some guru, how many will survive? Extremely simple, it works spontaneously, means the living process. Like one seed is put in the Mother earth it sprouts because the seed has got the sprouting power built in, and the Mother earth also has the sprouting power. So it is spontaneously, it's your own power within yourself is there built in which is awakened, and once you have mastered it you can awaken other people like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten other candles. It's like that, as simple as that.

But people can't believe anything so simple in modern times. I mean if I say you can eat your food like this, they say why not this way? All right, go ahead, nothing wrong with that, but this is a simple way. In the same way, one has to understand, that if it is within us, is our own power, and we can all get it, why not? All right, they get it, I know, in My program many will come; always I don't know why they come to My program. I don't know, maybe some sort of a thing, but, they come to My program but they don't grow; they are just the same; they don't grow because you have to come to the collective. It's not an individual happening, all right Mother am I at home, I do meditation. It won't work out. Of course you have to meditate a little bit but mostly you have come to collective. If you come to the collective it works because it is a collective happening, it is one collective organism.

For example, if My one nail is cut out and keep somewhere, it won't grow. It has to be connected with the whole body, it's logical. Absolutely try to understand it's logical; and if you think that you cannot come to the collective, only you'll come when I am coming, you will never grow, you'll never fulfill your mission, you will not know why you are here. In a humble way one should come to the collective, learn everything, it is very simple to learn.

Even children know, even children understand, they are better sometimes, because they haven't got have such conditionings, they are very simple and they know how to do it. So I would request you that after this program, when there is follow-on, I hope you will all come and grow so next time when I come I'll find all of you very much grown; not only that but all of you have given realizations to others. I know of people, one person, giving realization to twenty-two thousand people. But that's another area where it has worked. It's growing like fire, in many countries like Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, everywhere, Hungary, also in India, also it is growing very much in Europe. There are fifty-five nations altogether where Sahaja Yoga is growing.

So, if you understand the value of your life, value of this time, and what you have to achieve I am sure you'll take it up seriously and grow, that's all I want. I want you to have all the powers of the world, all the powers that are within you, must be expressed. You see My age, I'm quite an old woman, must be the oldest amongst all of you, who are sitting here, but I don't feel tired, I just enjoy. When I was leaving New York I felt sorry, little bit I felt, because there were so many Sahaja Yogis, I'm a Mother after all. But when I came here and I saw all other Sahaja Yogis here from Cincinnati and from this place, again, I felt all right. That's how life is, and I hope you all understand what I am saying about respect yourself.

May God bless you.

The last thing which is promised that you will enjoy yourself, you'll be never bored. You'll enjoy yourself and you'll enjoy everyone. Such friendship, such love, such affection, such understanding, that you cannot believe that such a race exists. I hope you all want to have your Realization, those who don't want to have, I cannot force, it cannot be forced, because you have been given your freedom and if you want to have I can of course work it out by your own powers, but those who don't want I don't want to force them, I respect your freedom. So those who do not want to have Self Realization should leave the hall and should oblige Me and others. But those who want to have should know that it takes hardly ten to fifteen minutes, such a short time, and for them I have to tell that there are three conditions. Again I would request those who don't to have should leave the hall please.

The first condition is that you have to have full faith in yourself. You have to have full confidence that you will get your Self Realization, I promise you, you all can get. Please have complete confidence in yourself.

So the second condition follows, that you should not feel guilty for anything whatsoever at this moment. Not to feel guilty, if you have done mistakes, all right, after all you are human beings you are not gods. If you have done mistakes it's all right; for these mistakes I would say you should face them at that time and finish them. But when we people feel guilty, what they do, they take the guilt and put it here in the left side of this Vishuddhi, which is a very, very dangerous thing to do. As a result of that, you suffer physically, you might get spondylitis, you might get angina, you might get also lethargic organs; so why to have any guilt, what's the use? Like a little baby, you are looking after the guilt, which is so troublesome.

Now people do tell you that you are sinners, I know that, all kind of nonsense that way, it's not true. Who are they to judge you? You shouldn't judge yourself either. Again I say respect yourself.

This Kundalini is your Mother, your individual Mother. She knows everything about Me. She has everything recorded in Her inner coils just like a tape recorder, you can say. She knows everything and She is very anxious to give you your Realization. She is the reflection of the Primordial Mother, the Holy Ghost, and She's just waiting for this time.

So you leave it, the judgment to Her, you don't judge yourself. This is very important because if by this chakra, this chakra gets blocked, the Kundalini won't rise. Now the third very important and the simplest condition is that you should forgive everyone in general. Meaning you should not even think about that, not worth thinking. Now, what's the logic, what's the logic for it. The logic for it is this, that, if you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. What do you do if you don't forgive? Nothing, it's a myth. But when you don't forgive then, mentally you torture yourself all the time. So you are playing into wrong hands. Supposing, somebody has tortured you or troubled you or put you into difficulties, then he is enjoying himself or she is enjoying herself. While you are all the time bothering yourself with this kind of a feeling that, I hate that person, and I will do this to that person. Just forgive, just forgive.

So this mental torture will be over but the main point today is that there's a center of Agnya on the optic chasm, which is very constricted, extremely constricted, like this, you can say, it is like this, and Kundalini won't move unless and until you forgive. But when you forgive it opens and then Kundalini will move. So all your life you have tortured yourself for somebody else and now at this great moment why do you want to lose your Self Realization? I'm telling you again and again because this is one of the worst centers people have. They just can't forgive. [Sounds like it's something], "I can't forgive" I mean what, just you have to say, "I forgive everyone" finished, that's all. At this moment you have just say, "I forgive everyone" finished. Any thought comes to you say, "I forgive." That's all, isn't it simple? So, let us have some love for ourselves and some mercy.

As a result of this you'll be surprised, many diseases have been cured, of course cancer and all kind of diseases have been cured, no doubt about it, and you don't get diseases. If you happen to get something immediately will know you are going to get it, and can cure yourself. It is that simple. It looks fantastic. I know it looks fantastic, but now supposing you take a television into a remote village and tell them, from this television you can see all kinds of films. They'll say what, this box, what are you telling us? We also think we are just a box, but once you are connected, like the television you will see how fantastic it is. You are extremely fantastic. You don't know your powers, you don't know yourself, that's the main thing, you don't know yourself, so you have to know yourself, that's all. Is said by all the saints, all the prophets, and all the incarnations that you have to know yourself.

Of course, I mean if you are trying to do Sahaja Yoga also going to somebody else, and to somebody else, then it is like you are one foot is in the mouth of the crocodile and one on the boat. It's difficult. It is better to take to crocodile and spare the boat, all right.

Now, they want that before I start it you should ask Me some questions. Will be good idea.

[Moderator]: If you have any questions for Shri Mataji ...

[Audience]: My name is Chief Agada from Nigeria, I came to Canada six years ago. My sister came four years ago, after that. The first time she came in to a country that she never knew before, having that problem, she get organized with Your organization, she was so happy that Your organization turned her life, up, up, up, that today I am proud of her. She had a dream that You're coming, that is why I brought her. I am proud You Madam, I am, sincerely proud of You. And because of that I am putting two hundred dollars cash.

[Moderator]: He wants to give You some money, Mother, he wants to give You some money.

[Shri Mataji denotes HH Shri Mataji is answering]

Shri Mataji: For what?

[Moderator]: For helping his sister.

[Mr Agada]: My sister loves You more than anybody. My sister is over there.

Shri Mataji: That's very good. May God Bless.

[Mr Agada]: And she is here. She had a dream You're coming. We just came in.

Shri Mataji: I'll have to go to Nigeria now. All right. Now, anything else?

[Mr Agada]: My question is ... what makes You so powerful? Why You are?

[Moderator]: Why are You so powerful, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Who? I? Because I am a mother.

[Mr Agada]: Can I be as powerful as You? Because I want to be the richest black man ever to live on earth.

Shri Mataji: Why not, why not, I would love for you to be as powerful as Myself, that's what Mother wants. That's My love is, you can be. This is no power. This is power of love. We have know how powerful it is. We have never used power of love. What we have used is power of hatred. This is power of love. We don't know how powerful it is, the power itself is powerful. All right, May God Bless.

[Mr Agada] Excuse me Mother, [can't You take two hundred dollars].

Shri Mataji: No, no, My child, it's all right. When I will need money I will let you know, all right.

[Mr Agada] Mother, can You do me a favor? Can You do me a favor? The only favor I want from You, can You see my sister, face to face, she is proud of You, she is proud of You, she die for You.

Shri Mataji: I am also proud of her [unclear].

[Mr. Agada]: Can You see her, this is just like You, see her.

Shri Mataji: Of course I will see her, why not?

[Mr. Agada]: O.K. Let her come up.

Shri Mataji: She can come after the program, I will see her. All right?

[Mr. Agada]: God bless You, Madam.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

[Moderator]: Any other questions?

[Audience]: Pardon me for asking this question, but, earlier You talked about the resurrection and You mentioned about the scriptures, where like in the Hindus scriptures they talk about the Kalki Avatar who will come for the resurrection, and for the Christians, I know they talk about the return of Christ and all the religions talk about this resurrection and the belief in the coming of the Messiah so I just want to know since You say You are going to give the resurrection to us, what is Your station?

Shri Mataji: In Russia?

[Audience]: And are You the promised Messiah then?

Shri Mataji: Are you?

Shri Mataji: I see now, I am not going to tell you anything about Myself, to be very frank. Because see Christ said He was the Son of God, and they crucified Him. I don't want to get crucified.

You have to find out, when you become the Spirit; you will know what I am. I don't want to say anything about Myself. Even Mohammed Saab did not say. He said positively I am not divine. How can it be? He just told because if you say you're divine, everybody will jump on you. That's what the human beings are like.

[Moderator]: Any other questions:

[Audience]: I have two questions, first of all I have problems, you know I'm a follower, I'm a seeker for a long time. Can I eat meat or fish? In some group meditation programs they say I cannot even eat egg, nothing. So on the other hand when you breath in and out there we kill many bacteria. Now where do we draw the line? The second question is do You believe in reincarnation or not.

Shri Mataji: First question is how to make out a person whether he is genuine or not. Simple question. Nanak Saab said Sat Guru ohi jo sahib mili he, the one who makes you meet God is the Sat Guru, not just talking. But is very meticulous way is this.

First you must meet the disciples. What do they do? How much knowledge they have of inner being? What powers have they got? Are they compassionate or aggressive people? What is their bona fides. How do they talk? First, you must see the disciples and then acceptable. It's like in the market when you go. It is a marketing. These people are marketing. So you first find out. What is this particular thing is? And is selling for so much and so much and what effect it has given others. But another very simple method is that you cannot pay for it, it's the main thing. You cannot pay for it. All right, at the most you can pay for this hall, all right. But for your own power for your evolution you cannot pay. What did we pay to become human beings? Money question doesn't arise. All these gurus and all these religions are nothing but money oriented or power oriented.Nobody is spirit oriented; this is the best way to judge a guru. Thank God in India we have had many great Saints and they have written about it, how a false person is and how a real person is. Of course some of the gurus may not be as compassionate and loving as Myself because I am a Mother, but they are truthful people. Sometimes they used to throw stones, I know that and hit their disciples. But why go to them? You can get it yourself. So, I am your Mother, I am not your guru, I am your Mother

One more question? All right.

[Moderator confirms question from the audience: Do You believe in reincarnation?]

Shri Mataji: Ah. The second question is do You believe in reincarnation? Of course, it's no question of believing it, it's a fact. Yes Madam?

[Audience] I'm Heather, I just can't let the men get away with this, there's all men. My question is, there's lot of talk about having a living master, and that you can't do this stuff without a living master, I would like your opinion of that?

Shri Mataji: Why do you want to have masters? I'll make you the master.

[Audience]: I already am the master.

Shri Mataji: You will become the master. You will know everything yourself. You will become the master. There is no need to have a master. Why this slavery?

[Audience]: That's my opinion, but there's a lot of talk about you need a living master. I just wanted your opinion, thanks very much.

Shri Mataji: You know there are all kinds and so far I've met only one who is a real master, but he is a horrible fellow. He beats people and all that. I don't want you to go to him, at all. He does all kinds of horrible things which I don't like, so, I mean he is a real master, but he has not giving Realization to anybody because he says he gave it to one who became a bad boss who doesn't want to give to anyone. So he says, You are a Mother, do what you like, so that's what it is. So why should we have masters? We are all masters, you all can become masters. These are all masters, what do you think them to be? These masters who feel shy, who are humble, who don't dress up with a new kind of a expression but are just like you.

[End of Question and Answer period]

And thirdly you are to forgive everyone in general. Now I've to tell you that there is left side and right side, we have and the left side is the power of desire, the right side is the power of action. So what we do is to take our shoes out to take help from the Mother earth. Mother earth is sometimes very helpful we take our shoes out and put the feet on the Mother earth little away from each other because these are two powers. So, now we put our left hand on our lap, very comfortably, you have to be extremely comfortable, that does not mean you should be slouching. Comfortably, comfortably sit straight. I mean, now we don't have to go to Himalayas, stand on our heads you see, just be comfortable in your chairs. All right. In short, we have to be pleasantly placed towards ourselves, pleasantly placed, not to have anger or any kind of contempt or depression.

Now please put the left hand towards Me like this, and right hand we are going to use for nourishing our centers, only for tonight, just for tonight, you need not remember anything about it. Just for tonight we have to use our right hand.

So please put your left hand on your lap on the left side and please put now your right hand on your heart, inside the coat. It's all right. In the heart resides the Spirit, and if you become the Spirit you become your own guide, your own the master. So we take down our right hand the upper portion of our abdomen, upper abdomen, upper portion, we are working only on the left side, upper portion of our abdomen, and press it. This is the center of our mastery, this is created by many prophets, seers and Saints which we have to awaken. Now we take our hand down onto the lower portion of our abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center, you'll be surprised to know, is for the pure knowledge of the divine.

Of course I cannot force this knowledge on you; later on I'll tell that you have to ask for it. Now raise your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen, this chart is showing what is to be done, then onto your heart, then onto your angle between your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to the right. Now this is center where you feel guilty as I told you and it's quite bad in this congregation so please remember not to feel guilty at all. Now, please take your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head slowly as far as possible. Here you have to forgive everyone in general, this we will done later on, now please take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head, here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from this All Pervading Divine Power just for your satisfaction push back your head.

Now stretch your palm fully, and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area, which is a soft bone in your childhood. Now please put down your head, please put down your head, now the important thing is to stretch back your fingers, so there is a good pressure on your scalp. Now, move your scalp seven times, slowly, clockwise. Please bend your heads, bend your heads. Push back your fingers and move it slowly. Now, that is all we have to do, altogether.

So please see that you put your both feet apart from each other and put your left hand on your lap and please put your right hand on your heart, you have to remove your glasses also because it might help. Now close your eyes, you shouldn't open your eyes 'til I tell you. Keep your eyes shut. At this center you have to ask Me a very fundamental question three times. You can call Me Mother, or you can call Me Shri Mataji. Please say three times, ask a question, Mother Am I the Spirit? Ask this question three times.

Audience begins to speak out loud, Shri Mataji indicates: Ask in your heart.

[Moderator Interjects: If ask the question just to yourself, inside, that's fine].

Now, please take down your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it and here again you have to ask another fundamental question to Me about yourself, three times, Mother, am I my own master? Now, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, here is the center of Pure Divine Knowledge, I've already told you that I cannot force on you, so please ask six times. Mother, please give me pure divine knowledge; ask six times, because this center has got six petals. As soon as you ask for the pure divine knowledge, this Kundalini, this force in the sacrum bone, starts rising.

So now we have to nourish our upper centers, with our full self confidence. So raise your right hand, in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it hard, and here say with full self confidence. Mother, I am my own Master, say it ten times. I have already told you in the beginning that you are not this body, this mind, this ego or conditioning but you are the pure Spirit. So raise your right hand on top of your heart and here you have to say again with full self confidence, twelve times, Mother, I am the pure Spirit. This all pervading divine power of love is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of bliss, ocean of joy. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever mistakes you have committed are easily dissolved by this power of ocean of love and ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself.

Raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, push it back your hand, as far as possible, and now turn your head to the right. Here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence, Mother, I am not guilty at all, please say it sixteen times. I have already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. On the contrary if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands, and at this moment you have to open your Agnya Chakra by forgiving, so please forgive everyone in general so that you don't miss your Self Realization. I have to see that you get your Realization but you have to forgive. I can't do that for you, please forgive. So now raise your, raise your right hand on top of your forehead, and put down your head as far as possible, and here you have to say with your full confidence, not how many times, but from your heart. Mother, I forgive everyone. From your heart, not how many times, just put your hand on top of your forehead. Put down your head.

Still, if you feel that you cannot forgive then I cannot help you. Please forgive. Now take your right hand back, on the back side of your head, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, here you have to say or you have to ask forgiveness from the All Pervading Power, by saying. Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly. Please ask forgiveness, just for your satisfaction. Please turn your head up, towards the sky. Now stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, now please put down your head, and push back your fingers. Here you must put a proper pressure on your scalp and move it, move it slowly seven times, but here again I cannot force Self Realization on you. While moving your hand you have to ask for your Self Realization. Mother, please give me Self Realization, you have to say seven times, when you are moving your hand, seven times. Please bend your heads, bend your heads, bend your head. This is very important. Stretch back your fingers. Stretch your fingers. Please bend your head.

It's most important center is this last one, this is the actualization of your baptism. Now, please open your eyes, put back, take down your hands, and put both of them towards Me like this. Please put both the hands towards Me like this, little higher. Now, here you push your right hand towards Me and put down your head and see with your left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze-like vibrations are coming out; breeze-like from your own head. Move your left hand. Now if you have not forgiven they will be hot, please try to forgive at this time. You shouldn't put your hand on top of your head, little away, some people get it much more further, so please move your hand and see for yourself. If you are getting any cool or a hot breeze on your head, from your head. Bend your head, it's the best, now again please try the left hand towards Me. Now bend your head nicely, and with the right hand. Now you see for yourself with the right hand, you see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area, the soft bone in your childhood. Just see if it is coming out. Raise your hand.

Now, try with right hand again. Put the right hand towards Me and put the left hand on top of your head. Now bend your head again, and please see for yourself, if there's a cool or hot breeze is coming out of your head. Now this is what is the Kundalini coming out and is connecting you to the All Pervading Power. Now, please put both hands like this, and watch Me without thinking; just see if you can do it, just put both the hands towards Me and watch Me without thinking. Now please put both hands, like this and push back your head, here you have to ask one of these questions three times:

One of these questions three times. First question is, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?, the second question is, Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of divine love, the Ruh?, and the third question is, Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya? Ask any one of these questions three times, push back your head. See upward and ask this question.

Now, please take down your hands. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their finger tips or on their palms, or through their fontanel bone area, through their head, please raise both your hands.

Just image, most of you have got it; why Indians haven't got it I can't understand; they must be having some gurus or something. Must be. All of them. Just imagine. May God Bless you. Now you are for the first time feeling this All Pervading Power of divine love, for the first time, but now you have to learn how to use it. You'll feel the peace and you'll feel the joy. You may feel you are on the top of the world but that's not enough. You have to grow and this connection has to be fixed.

I'm sorry some Indians didn't get, what's the matter? Normally Indians are very good at it if they come. All right we'll see then. In any case, May God Bless you all. Thank you very much. I am going tomorrow. I will be coming back again after one year. Tomorrow I'm going to Vancouver in the morning. I'm very happy to see you all getting your Realization. Now you have to grow, and those who haven't got also should go and see for themselves what's wrong. Why didn't they get their Realization? And I'm sure it will all work out, they are all experts here and it will all work out, and you will all have your Self Realization. May God bless.

[Moderator]: There are weekly meetings much like this where you can actually go and further establish and learn more about the meditation.

Shri Mataji: Hello, they want to sing a song to Me, if you don't mind if you can wait for one more song, they want to sing a song.

[Moderator]: So we are going to have one short musical piece and just to tell you a little bit about music. A lot of people, music seems to communicate with lots of people in different ways, it is very inspiring, and one of the things with the music which is produced by the Sahaja Yogis is that as they are connected, the music itself has vibrations so perhaps if they play something you can have your hands out and you may feel the cool breeze as a result of the of the music.

We find that the music is one of the easiest ways to enjoy, so we have lots of people playing music.

We are going to have one song, I'm not sure if it will be in Hindi or Marathi, and one of the things we find even the Westerns can very quickly master at least in singing in foreign languages and then we'll have an English song as well.

(Two music pieces followed.)
