b'\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeeper Meditation\xe2\x80\x9d, London, 20 February 1978\n\nCooly (Tony Paniotou) have you written it down?\n\nShri Mataji: Hello, How are you?\n\nYogi: Very well, thank you.\n\nShri Mataji: May God bless! You can sit on the chair. Be comfortable.\n\nYogi: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s very kind!\n\nShri Mataji: Ask Cooly to write it down for him.\n\nYogi: He is doing it. \n\nHello! How are you Douglas? How are you?\n\nDouglas Fry: Very well!\n\nShri Mataji: Looking very fine! Just like a flower beautiful! See what beautiful children I have, just like these petals over here.\n\nCan you open a window for a while. Just open the window for five minutes.\n\nSit comfortably. Be comfortable, like this. I mean. Yes, be very comfortable. One has to be very, very comfortable, very comfortable. \n\nShe got it even before she had seen me! Because that shows that it\xe2\x80\x99s flicking in the air.\n\nToday I want to tell you about further meditation: how we have to go and how we have to understand ourselves.\n\nYou see the thing is, so far you have had habits of dealing with things, and your practices: how you have dealt with the worldly problems, with your personal problems, your physical problems, body problems, but now as you have entered into the Kingdom of God and the power of God is flowing through you, you must know that your solutions and your styles have to be different now; that is, you have to put your attention at the disposal of God. Actually in your attention His light is flooded. \n\nI will try to explain it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s just the opposite of what you have so far known.\n\nYou always thought that you have to put your attention to a point and then you have to move, then you have to attack the subject or attack the problem, put all your energies, divert to it and to then take upon yourself the responsibility, the complete technique of the whole thing, how to work it out. And that was a, sort of a, life\xe2\x80\x99s experience for you. You would use all your experiences that you have had about such a problem, a particular type of problem, all others, whatever they have had, all the books that are available and even out of these enterprises that have been for a particular problem. All right. Then you attack it, that problem. And then you find that, when you try to attack, it just slips out of your hands, you just can\xe2\x80\x99t find it, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how you have missed it.\n\nNow, this Sahaja is a very different system. Now you have entered into a Kingdom of God, you are saints, and everything that was built so far is for your good.\n\nYou have to experiment and see for yourself. But the thing is: you must give it a chance. Your attention itself is now flooded with light. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to any books, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go anywhere. Your attention itself is flooded with that light which is dynamic. Now, if anything comes in your attention, you just connect your attention with the Divine\xe2\x80\x99s attention. How? By saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, let it be done. Let this be done as your wish.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThy will be done!\xe2\x80\x9d This is what you should say: Thy will be done. You just say this, you will be surprised. And then the whole mechanism, that enlightened attention of yours is the part of the attention of God Itself. So the whole thing will work out, the whole force. As you have worked for your personal problem before, now the whole of it will work out and it will happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a wonderful thing.\n\nAnd the attention has to be there, has to be in the subtle. Because your attention is in the gross that\xe2\x80\x99s why you attack the problem in this manner. If your attention is somehow or other made more attracted towards the subtle then, what happens [is] the effect of that will be shown. Otherwise also, you will see it. But then you will see it very clearly how it acts.\n\nFor example now, say, I come in my room and you have done all these things so beautifully, it\'s all worked out so nicely, then when I come in here and I see all that, now I don\xe2\x80\x99t see every minute part of it, I don\'t see how it is done, this, that, everything, but I just stand here, and I feel the whole thing within me, bubbling. It works, and it gives me joy, gives me joy, fills me with joy. Different types of joys start flowing in my body, in my being. In my full understanding it\xe2\x80\x99s flowing and it\xe2\x80\x99s making me happy. Now I don\'t judge it on the way the people who judge [would]. They would immediately come, supposing it\xe2\x80\x99s another level of person, he would come and see in a very gross way. He\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh this one, it would be nice. And this is a stone and this is the thing.\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThis should not have been here and that should not have been there!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHow much you paid for that?\xe2\x80\x9d and "Why did you give so much money?" It goes on, on like that. But a person who is Divine, he may talk the way you are talking, but in that also it\'s playing, the Divine is playing its part. It is just playing its part just to make a little, sort of a, hallucination for you. But inside that flow of the Divine is just to give you joy, to get you all right. Even when such a person scolds you or says something it has that way.\n\nIn the same manner if you make yourself very, very subtle. How? That any gross ideas come into you, \xe2\x80\x9cYou just shut up! I don\xe2\x80\x99t like you.\xe2\x80\x9d Gradually your mind will be so trained, I mean, it would be so much understanding the nectar of subtleness that it would reject automatically. You will live with this world but you will not feel it, you will not be involved. You\'ll be eating food, all right very good and very nicely this, that, but then you don\'t know what you are eating. You are just enjoying the love that is in that food.\n\nSo to be subtle and to be that love, your attention has to be on love. If your attention is guided by the price of the thing, the quality of the thing and all that, then that subtleness cannot be in you.\n\nSo to be subtle is also a mental activity after Sahaj Yog. Now many people think Sahaja is a standstill stuff, which it\'s not true. Sometimes you misunderstand the meaning of \xe2\x80\x98sahaj\xe2\x80\x99. That is like a, first I say that the car will start sahaja, all right? But you put the accelerator on. You have to manoeuvre the thing, That is most sahaja because you have become a Sahaj. If your attention is sahaja then automatically you\xe2\x80\x99ll manage. When you have mastered the manoeuvring of the car you just do it automatically, sahaj.\n\nBut to be that Sahaja you have to first of all try. If you don\'t learn that, then that will mean that you are just at a standstill. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I have left it to Sahaja, when the vibrations will come, they\xe2\x80\x99ll come!\xe2\x80\x9d It won\xe2\x80\x99t! Because there are still problems with you. You are not yet that subtle. So to remove that, now you can remove, to make yourself Sahaja. \n\nTo cleanse yourself, absolutely, you have to work out a little. For example, now with vibrations like this you have an imbalance in the body, supposing, then you have to remove it. You know how to remove it. This is what has happened with Sahaja Yoga, that you know there is an imbalance, you know that my such chakra is catching, that this has happening. Now you bring it to the subtle point, [which] is first of all you have to work on it physically. All right?\n\nTo make yourself absolutely clean there are so many ways. First and foremost is to feel the vibrations of different hands, seeing them, how it works out. Which is more, which is less, how it\xe2\x80\x99s coming. Why is it this thing? Then finding out, \xe2\x80\x9cHow? Where did I catch it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Such and such person!\xe2\x80\x9d Beat him with shoes.\n\nThese are all gross things and have to be taken away by gross things. You beat them. For me I don\'t need any beating or anything: just looking at it, it runs away.\n\nIf I have been there only itself runs away. I don\'t have to bother. But for you people, you do catch. So for that reason you have to be careful: physically you have to work it out. \n\nSo there\xe2\x80\x99s so many ways. Like even, many people now were speaking, \xe2\x80\x9cOh we are now Realised, why should we sit in the water?\xe2\x80\x9d No! Everyday as we have a bath, we have to do it.Mother knows many things, you know! It\xe2\x80\x99s a very good idea, you see. Just to avoid what is there? \xe2\x80\x9cNow we are all right, you know, the vibrations we are getting in our had!\xe2\x80\x9d But you are not subtler! Still you catch from others.\n\n So all these physical things are to be done still, really, because still it is, we should say,  paralysis still. It\'s not yet an absolutely perfectly a healthy person. So you have to do it. That\xe2\x80\x99s one thing. Physically, whatever is the physical thing you know about.\n\nEven if you want you can take it out, like that, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem. Now this fellow was nearly taken out like that. You can! You want to pull it out. It does! It does work.  Every action after all is a sahaja action. Nobody does like this. You do it. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s hot and terrible you just take it out.\n\nIf you see a realised-soul, a small little child, you\'ll be amazed. They will go to an airport, they will be going on like this. All the time they will be going on like this, on their own! You don\'t have to tell them. But for you, you must understand that, that state is still there, so that you must feel it. And you should really throw it away. Physically it has to be done. It\xe2\x80\x99s an exercise and you cannot be \xe2\x80\x98sahaja\xe2\x80\x99 about it, no.\n\nThere is a difference between me and you, so you have to work it out. Those who think, "We are realised all right, finished! Now we are on top of the world!\xe2\x80\x9d You should grow, evolve in understanding, and respect ourselves, that, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, we have to still rise and still rise and still rise.\xe2\x80\x9d This is the physical side which is very important.\n\nThen the second side is the mental side. Now mentally also all of the time we are bombarded with things from all over. You read the newspaper in the morning, its finished! You catch on your agnya, catch on your mooladhara \xe2\x80\x94 horrible thing it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sadistic thing. If you see that you just get a fright, the way things are described.\n\nSo what you have to do, mentally, you must understand these are horrid things. Now, you cannot say that, \xe2\x80\x9cI am innocent, I am reading this, it\'s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d No, you catch. So what you [should] do is to put a bandhan to the thing . And if you want today to read it, you read two lines, and if you think it\'s worth it, read it. Otherwise what\xe2\x80\x99s the use reading pornography? That\xe2\x80\x99s not meant for us. We are different people. You must know we are a different class. This is not meant for us at all. So what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of reading anything that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to give us pleasure? Read something pleasurable, something nice. Like the lecture of Sadat, I can say or something like that. Then you go to say, such things, or something like that, then you go ahead. And when you read it you support that person inside. But if you read pornography, you are caught and you become one of them. Because of the habits, just the old habits, you see. These are old habits. Anything that you see must you read? Not necessarily.\n\nPeople have habits of reading all the advertisements on the way. If they miss one they\'ll turn round to see that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss it. Another they\xe2\x80\x99ll see this and this. These are the habits we have. So we have to make our attention subtler: \xe2\x80\x9cOh where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d So be alert about it. So mentally we have to be alert.\n\nThen another thing of mentally is to see what thoughts are coming to you. Still negative thoughts come to you, [there\xe2\x80\x99s] no denying of the fact. May not be about Sahaj Yoga, but may be it\'s about something else, may be about something in life. You might be dreaming about such things. At that time what you have to do is to sit down and do a push with positive thoughts like, as I said a very good way they say [is] that, count your blessings one by one. Say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow fortunate am I? In this world there are so many people. Out of that even in this London there are so many. Out of that I am the one who has found out really the Truth. How fortunate I am! And I am the one who is going on the right path, I feel it. And I am moving. If I have to move it on this path, let me be very, very positive. So let me move on this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen you start doing that you will be amazed that gradually these negative ideas will go away. Because even now you are attacked. You are very much attacked. And the ideas come to you. And then, as your habits are, because you are all the intelligent people, and brought up with this intelligent atmosphere, there are styles I have seen. The intelligent styles are very dangerous, they are more dangerous than foolish styles. The intelligent styles are that you take it in such a way that you cheat yourself. All the time you start accepting things and you start cheating yourself. And these ideas get sedimented in your being, gradually. And suddenly you find a big thing in your head and you say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, from where this has come in? What has happened to me?\xe2\x80\x9d So be careful! Because these sedimentations will be settling down in you, gradually. And you have had those habits of intelligent way of doing things.\n\nWhen you do intelligently? Actually what is intelligent doing, so many times, is just to push it upside down and bring it inside you. You can see this is something so funny but it is so, that when you deal with something intelligently you know how to escape it, and how to avoid it and how to make it look different to yourself. You yourself, with intelligence, deceive yourself and make it look different and then you accept that thing, and that becomes a part and parcel of you and you are not aware of it. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it Gregoire? It\xe2\x80\x99s a common style, so be careful!\n\nWhen you start clearing out your Vishuddhi part of it, you will be surprised the subtleness will start flowing in you, the subtleness will appear before you. The subtleness is a state. It is a state of your attention.\n\nYour attention is gross outside. Now you think of some sort of a moon which is just a stone you can call it. Then it starts little bit moving, becomes little, I should say, mobile, then gradually it becomes subtle. The core is melting away, the outside is still hard. It\xe2\x80\x99s like that is your attention. It starts melting in you.\n\nNow you are in the core, you are not outside, but whenever you come in contact, the core part contacts with the gross, suddenly you start becoming one with it, then the crust starts again becoming an immobile stuff and the core starts becoming strong. Again you increase the core, it starts again to go out to periphery and the things stars melting. That is how the attention, if you can understand, is. And that attention, which is enlightened in you, has to be kept all the time enlightened: no justification with yourself! With others also we don\'t have to justify. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\n\nYou think that we must grow, we must be all right, we must be very good and when we find somebody is troubling us, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather difficult to tolerate a nonsense like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. But, for that, I am sitting down, and you just tell me and I can manage it! You have seen [how] we have solved one problem very nicely, and we can solve all the problems. (laughing) It\xe2\x80\x99s a very clever way, isn\'t it? That\'s the subtle way! It just gets solved!\n\nSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about anything. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to think [a] hundred times! Though I am the person who has put you in problems! You see, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, \xe2\x80\x9cDo like this! You should have done like this! You should have put in effort like this!\xe2\x80\x9d But the problem I will be solving myself, you see. But I will make you run up and down to see that. On the contrary when you see me doing like that you should understand I am I am playing tricks with you!\n\nSo the problems can be solved just like that (Mother clicks her fingers), if your attention is subtle. But if it is not the basic problem is that you cannot approach this. The approach to the problem is only possible if you are a subtle being. If you are not a subtle being you cannot approach any problem.\n\nSo, to be subtle and to be there, to be Divine, one has to understand the grossness that is covering you. Through Kundalini you can because you can raise your Kundalini, see where it is hanging. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s very heavy here. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a stone here. It\xe2\x80\x99s thumping here. It\xe2\x80\x99s doing all these things.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very gross way of looking at it, very gross way of looking at it. It is suggesting to you, something. So what you have to do is to see for yourself now, at Sahastrara - that\xe2\x80\x99s the place for Somebody we know - then you just sit down and say, \xe2\x80\x9cNow what have I done? Why these problems I myself am having? And if I have done anything like that, please forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d It works out. It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple way.\xc2\xa0\n\nBut first of all, foremost thing, is that, what is the substance you gave me? Is it a subtle substance that\xe2\x80\x99s speaking or the gross one? From which point are you speaking is the thing. Supposing you are speaking from that point where you are a governor general, everybody has to obey you! But if you are speaking from the point where you are a peon, nobody is going to obey you.\n\nSo where is the attention is the thing.\n\nSo mentally you have to work it out in your meditation.\n\nNow you sit down for meditation, all right, mostly trying to be thoughtlessly aware. But if there are thoughts you should try to keep it down by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHow fortunate that I have felt these vibrations, I felt it. And how happy I am about it! Now you get away all the negative thoughts!\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s how you can fight it out. Now whatever you do will lead you to Sahaja, not before. Before Realisation it has no meaning. It was a dead car standing there, but now the car has started moving. And whatever you do whatever you try, it will make you subtler and subtler.\n\nSimple things like the declaration that, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am going to do this! I have decided to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d Put your mind to positive thinking: What are we going to do? How are we going to do it? How are we going to work it out? \n\nYou will be surprised how the things will come. But normally our habits are for our gross problems.\n\nNow I would say Bombay Sahaja Yogis are quite developed and they are quite good but still sometimes they really tumble down very badly. This time I thought they were a little bit proud than anything else because Delhi people were not so good at things and they had to come and do it. And I think that Bombay people did feel that they were sort of lending a hand to Delhi people. It happened. But then they found themselves quite low and and all of them Humpty Dumpties sitting down there! You see, so it can happen.\n\nSo anyone who feels that, \xe2\x80\x9cI have achieved everything!\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cI have reached anything!\xe2\x80\x9d can have a Humpty Dumpty fall. Because it was so beautifully played. I\'ll tell you what happened: They came down and then in the Old Delhi we had no place to stay properly so I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, you arrange my place in the guesthouse and they can stay in the boys hostel and the girls can stay in the girls hostel.\xe2\x80\x9d They said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right it can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d So then the gross thing came in: so one of the persons said that, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see but the food in that boys hostel is full of oil and how can we eat there?\xe2\x80\x9d And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about it, nobody told me. And then they had to arrange it with somebody and they had to suddenly purchase all the food and everything and then to arrange a cook and they stayed with somebody. And where they stayed was all full of bhoots! And they were all caught up in the head, terrible and this and that and they came to me.\n\nSo they said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother what has happened to us? We came all the way and this is what has happened. Now we are all vomiting and this has happened. \xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Where are you eating these days? Not in that oily place?\xe2\x80\x9d They said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, we have our own cook we have our everything, but the problem is the house is full of bhoots and we are all finished with that!\xe2\x80\x9d So I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWho had asked you to suggest that? Can\'t you eat that food? So many thousands of boys are eating here. You are Sahaja Yogis you can\'t eat that food? Your attention is on the oily food. What is so special about yourselves that you can\'t eat? I mean you should be able to eat even the stones. That\xe2\x80\x99s what Sahaja Yoga is. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t eat the ordinary food that all so many thousands of boys are eating? And you wanted to stay away - such importance of yourself, so go ahead!\xe2\x80\x9d And it was all done by satanic forces. You should have thought once at least that, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are we wanting to go away from here to that place? And where it is all organised, let us be here!\xe2\x80\x9d That is Sahaja. That part also they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand \xe2\x80\x94 discrimination also of what is Sahaja and what is asahaja? Where are you Sahaja and where are you not, you should discriminate it. That point at least one should reach.\n\nSo the so called, the high, top class Sahaja Yogis fell down - dlaap! - like that, and they felt very shy and bad. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, don\'t you worry.\xe2\x80\x9d But it\xe2\x80\x99s a simple thing. It\'s a lesson now. Because you can overcome [the] food problem but what about the bhoots? Why should you go in with somebody, a person who has just come to Sahaja Yoga, and you don\'t know what sort of person he is? They said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, it\'s your Maya!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut what about you? You people were thinking that you are great and you are the greatest Sahaj Yogis ever born, and you are the topmost among all the world! So don\xe2\x80\x99t think like this.\xe2\x80\x9d And this is what happened.\n\nSo it plays on you, just to test you and it works on you. So, \xe2\x80\x98sahaja\xe2\x80\x99 means whatever comes your way you take it, no doubt, but you do it yourself with positiveness. That is very necessary. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you go on accepting everything \xe2\x80\x98sahaja\xe2\x80\x99 : \xe2\x80\x9cThe bhoots coming onto me, I\xe2\x80\x99m accepting. Everything coming onto me I\xe2\x80\x99m accepting!\xe2\x80\x9d That is not the way it is Sahaja, that\xe2\x80\x99s the point. When we start doing like that, then actually \xe2\x80\x98sahaja\xe2\x80\x99 what you will get is bhoots, and what you will get is all the negativity, and also you\xe2\x80\x99ll get all the sickness, illness, everything. You have to be careful.\n\nSo mentally you should be alert.\n\nPhysically you should work it out.\n\nAnd physically there\'s another point: is that you must look after your bodies, physically. [It\xe2\x80\x99s] very much necessary, because this body is the temple of God. It is definitely now the temple. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shrine. See how beautiful a shrine you have got. And I love to reside in this place.\n\nLet it be so beautiful that God should reside in that. Beautiful it is. Look after your body, look after your hair, look after yourself. If you treat yourself, there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm. People might say that, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I treat myself? I must take all the burdens on myself!\xe2\x80\x9d All these out of date ideas of sufferings are useless for Sahaj Yog. Nobody has to suffer. You have to be very, very healthy people.\n\nLike somebody said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it that Ramkrishna Paramahansa did not cure himself?\xe2\x80\x9d Because he did not know how to cure himself, first of all. But Ramkrishna said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to take all the burdens on my head.\xe2\x80\x9d You don\'t get sick if somebody is sick; you do not get sick. But, the only thing is that, if you look after your body, if you respect your body, then your body also respects you. You body understands! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for your body, you neglect your body, then body also says, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right I\'ll have my way!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo you have to look after your body. You have to know how to keep it all right. I think we should really write it down, all the things that are to be done to look after your body. That is very important, because in these modern times or in these modern societies, of course you have devised ways of comfort that you press here, then you get everything coming down, you press there and you get food inside your stomach and all that is there. Not everywhere this is! That is all comfort they call it but I call it lethargy, or can call it laziness. It is not going to give you good health.\n\nGood health is possible only if you understand the balancing and have every understanding about how the body acts and what happens to body: small, small things like hot and cold, cold and hot. This is very important for Sahaj Yoga.\n\nSahaja Yogis have to be perfect, absolutely perfect. And you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do with the norms of the modern times that everybody should be thin and everybody should be absolutely TB patients going around for some sort of a beauty parade!\n\nYou should be all very healthy people and impressive. Whenever you sit there people should literally be frightened of you that, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom where these wrestlers have come?\xe2\x80\x9d (laughing)\n\nSo this is the sign of attending to your health attending to yourself and your mental health also. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I say that you [should] be that you careful as to what you read and what you see and what you hear and how much attention you pay to it.\n\nYou see supposing now a person like David comes in: you pay too much attention to a man like that. Everything is filled with that, the whole atmosphere is talking about it. Everybody is worried about it, it\'s all going on. It\xe2\x80\x99s negative. I think you talked more about David than about me at that time. Because I have also come, but David was there. But [this] sort of thing, it happens. Because we are used to seeing a thing like a sensational thing coming up, you see. Like newspapers will always publish something sensational. We are used to sensational things, so Mr. David was quite important. But just see how unimportant he was \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s just disappeared. So if you had just neglected him and not bothered very much paying attention to him...\n\nI hope Cooly is not too long with the fellow, please call him. You see, I don\'t want Cooly to be curing him and getting into trouble. All right.\n\nSo the regular habits of sitting in the water and all that should be done.\n\nAlso regular habits about your mind: is not to read this. Just avoid! You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to read any more of these things. There are so many beautiful books you can read. If you have to read and if you are used to it, you can read beautiful books. I have told you so many of them are there. You can read The Bible and see for yourself that it is all Sahaja, every word. You can find out so many quotations and so many things which can help us to tell these Christians, otherwise they are not going to listen to us. They are such conformed sort of things, that you have to tell something from The Bible. You can read Koran, you can read other books like Khalil Gibran and things, which are supporting you, which are also helping you which are giving you ideas.\n\nAre you all right? You sure? I think better put your left hand towards me and right hand outside.\n\nSo you can close it now (turn off the recording).\n'
