Culie, have you written it down?

Hello, How are you? May God bless you. Let's sit on the chair. Be comfortable. Ask Culie to write it down for her. Sit comfortably, one has to be very very comfortable She got it before she has even seen Me. Because that show that it is flicking in the air. Because. Today I want to tell you about further meditation. How we have to do and how we have to understand ourselves.

You see the thing is so far you have had habits of dealing with things and your practices. How you have dealt with worldly problems with, say, your personal problems, your physical problems, body problems... But now as you have entered into the Kindom of God. and the power of God is flowing through you, You must know that your solutions and your styles have to be different now. That is... You have to... put your attention at the disposal of God. Actually in your attention His light is flooded. I will try to explain it because it is just the opposite of what you have had so far. You always thought that you had to put your attention to a point and then you have to move then you have to attack the subject or attack the problem put all your energies divert to it and... Hello, how are you? and to... then take upon your self the responsibility the complete technique of the whole thing, how to work it out and...That was the sort of a ... a life's experience. You would use all your experiences that you have had about such a problem about a particular type of problem all adults whatever they have had all the books that are available [ ] sorts of these enterprises that have been for a particular problem, alright, - then you attack it, that problem.

and then you find that when you try to attack it just slips out of your hands, you just can not find it, you do not understand how you have missed it Now, the Sahaja is a very different system: now you have entered into a Kingdom of God - you are saints. And everything that was built so far is for you. You have to experiment and see for yourself. But the thing is: you must give it a chance. Your attention itself is not located right. You do not have to go to any books, you do not have to go anywhere. Your attention itself is [ ] with that light which is dynamic. Now, if anything comes to your attention, you just.. connect your attention with the Divine's attention How? By saying: alright, let keep him down Let this be done as your wish. Thy will be done, this is what you should say: thy will be done.

You just say this you will be surprised and then the whole mechanism that enlightened attention of yours is the part of the attention of God Itself. so the whole thing will work out the whole force as you have worked for your personal problem before now the whole of it will work out and it will happen. It is such a wonderful thing and the attention has to be there, has to be in the subtle. see because your attention is in the gross that is why you attack the problem in this manner. If your attention is some or other made more attracted towards the subtle, then what happens: the effect will show otherwise also you will see but then you will see it very clearly how it acts. For example now, say, I come in My room. You have done all these things so beautifully, it's all worked out so nicely... then when I come in here I see all that. Now, I do not see every minute part of it, I do not see how it's done this that at the bed but I just stand here you see and I feel the whole thing underneath the problems - it works! and it gives Me joy, it fills Me with joy, different types of joy...My Body, My being, in My full understanding it's flowing it's making Me happy. Now I do not judge it on the way the public, the people who judge it.

They would immediately come supposing you see it is another level. First, you would come and see in a very gross way. They'd say oh this.. it would be nice and this is a stone and this is the thing that should not have been here. and that should not have been there, how much you are paying for that... You see it goes on on like that you see. But a person who is divine He may talk you see the way you are talking but in that also it's playing, the Divine is playing its part, it is just playing its part just to make a little, you see, a sort of hallucination for you. But inside that flow of the divine it is just to give you joy, to get you alright. Even when such a person scolds you or say something it has that. In the same manner if you make yourself very very subtle How? That any gross ideas come into you - just shut up [ ] Gradually your mind will be so trained, and it should be so much understanding the nectar of subtleness, that it could [ ] what can I tell you. You will live in this world but you will not feel it.

That'd be the way you feel it, you will not be involved. You'll be eating food alright [ ] very good [ ] very nicely this, that... But you do not know what you are eating you are just enjoying the love that is in that food. So to be subtle, to be that love, you see, your attention has to be on love. If your attention is guided by the price of the thing, the quality of the thing, and all that then that subtleness can not be. So to be subtle is also a mental activity after Sahaja Yoga. Now many people Sahaj they think is a stand still stuff - it is not. Sometimes you misunderstand the meaning of Sahaj. That is like... first I say that.. the car will start sahaja, alright? But you will put the accelerator, You have to manoeuvre the thing, That is most Sahaja because you have become a Sahaj.

If your attention is Sahaja then automatically you manage, you see, when you are a Master, the maneuvering of the car - you just do it automatically Sahaj. But to be that Sahaja you have to first of all try it. If you do not learn that that means that you are just at a stand still. Oh I have left it to Sahaja Yoga and the vibrations will come - will come [automatically]. Because there are still problems with you - you are not yet that subtle. So to remove that - now you can remove, to make yourself Sahaja, to cleanse yourself, absolutely, you have to work out a little. For example, now with vibrations like this you have an imbalance with the body, supposing, then you have to remove it. You know how to remove it. This is what has happened with Sahaja yoga that you know there is an imbalance. You know that my sub chakra is caught - catching That this has happened.

Now you bring it to the subtle point - first of all you have to work on it physically. Alright? To make yourself absolutely clean - there are so many ways. First and foremost, is feeling the vibrations, different hands move them, how it works out which is more which is less how it's.. coming [wise at] that thing then finding out How? Where did I catch it? Alright. Such and such person - beat him with shoes. You see these are all gross things and have to be taken away by gross things. with them. For Me I do not need any beating on it, just looking at it - it cancelled.

If I have been there only it is all [ ] I do not have to work but for you people - you do catch. so for that reason you have to be careful - physically you have to work it out. Just so many ways like even... Many people now must be thinking now we are realized - why should we sit in the wash? No. Every day as we have a bath - we have to do it. Mother knows many things.... It is a very good idea, you see, just to avoid you see what is there now we are alright you know the vibrations we are getting... but you are not subtler still you catch from other. So all these physical things are to be done still you need use because still it is we should say problem [is sustained] so it is not yet absolutely perfectly 100% so we have to do it. That is why physical... Whatever is the physical thing you know about.

Even if you want you can take [tablets] you see like that If there is a problem of this fellow [ ] could have taken out like that - you can. going to pull it out. It does it does work it's symbolic. Every action after all is a sahaja action. Nobody does like this. You do it because it is hot and terrible - you adjust it. If you see a realized soul - a small little child - you'll be amazed. They will be...they go to an airport - wow wow wow - they all like this will be doing. All the time they will be going on like this on their own you don't have to tell them. But for you you see you must understand that that state is still there.

So that you must feel it and you should really throw it away. Physically it has to be done. It is an exercise and you can not be sahaja about it - no. There is a difference between Me and you, so you have to work it out. Whose who think they are realized - alright- finished now [ ] evolved You should go, evolve, understand and respect others. Ð¢hat no, you have to still rise, still rise, and still rise. This is a physical side - means very important. The second side is a mental side. Now mentally also all the time you are bombarded with things from all over. You read the newspaper in the morning - it's finished.

Catch on your agnya, catch on your mooladhara - horrible thing it is. It is a sadistic thing: if you see that you just get a fright, the way things are described. So what we have to do? Mentally we must understand these are horrid things. Now you can not say I am innocent I am reading this - it's alright - no, you catch. What you do is to put a bandhan. And if you want to read, you read it: read two lines And if you think it's worth it you read it otherwise what is the use reading pornography. They are not just not meant for us. You must know we are different class, this is not meant for us at all. So what is the use of reading all this - it is not going to give us pleasure.

Read something pleasurable, something nice. Like the lecture of [Sadan] I can say or something like that. Then you go [ ] about, to say, sustenance or something like that, then you go ahead. When you read it you support that person's insight. But if you read pornography, you are caught and you become one of that. Because of the habits - they are all habits, you see. These are all habits. Anything that you see must you read? Not necessarily. You see people have habits of reading all advertisements are great.

If they miss one they'll turn out you see like this. Another then see this and this, you see, these are the habits we have so we have to make our attention subtler. Oh where are you going? So that we are alert about it. So mentally we have to be alert. Then another thing of mentally is to see what thoughts are coming to you, still negative thoughts come to you. No denying of the fact. Not may not be about Sahaja Yoga. May be it's about something else, may be about something in life, You might be dreaming about such things. At that time what you have to do: is to sit down and to push it with positive thoughts.

As I said a very good way of saying that count your blessings one by one. Say how fortunate am I. See, in this world there are so many people out of that even in this London there are so many. Out of that I am the one who has found out really the Truth. How fortunate I am. And I am the one who is going on the right path I feel it. I am a winner if i have to go with others back let me be very very positive. So let me move on (from) this. When you start doing that you will be amazed that gradually these [left dividers] will go away because even now you are attacked. You are very much attacked and the ideas come to you.

And then you see as your habits are you see because you are all the intelligent people. and brought up with this intelligent atmosphere you see there are styles I have seen, the intelligent styles are very dangerous. Ðhey are more dangerous than foolish styles. The intelligent styles are that you see you take it in such a way that you cheat yourself. All the time you start accepting things - you start cheating yourself. And these ideas get sedimented in your being gradually. And suddenly you find a big thing in your head all from where this [ ] is coming? What has happened to me? So be careful because these sedimentations will be settling down in you gradually. And you have had those habits of intelligent way of doing.

When you do intelligently? Actually what is intelligent doing? So many times it's just to push it upside down and bring it inside you. Ðou see this is [sad.. ] so funny but it is so. That when you deal with something intelligently you see you know how to escape it. And how to avoid it and how to, sort of, make it look different to Yourself you see you are yourself with intelligence deceive yourself and make it look different and then you accept that thing. And that becomes a part and parcel of you. And you are not aware of it. isn't it [ignorant]? It is a common style you see so be careful.

When you start clearing out your Vishuddhi part you will be surprised the subtleness will start flowing. The subtleness will appear. The subtleness is a state. It is a state of your attention. Your attention is gross outside. Now you think of some sort of a moving just a stone then it starts to little bit moving, becomes little, I should say, mobile. gradually it can start. The core is [melting a little]. Outside is still hard it's like that, it's your attention, it starts mentally. Now, whenever you come across, now you are in the core, you are not outside, but whenever you come in contact the core part contacts with the gross: suddenly you start becoming one within.

Then [ ] again becoming immobile style, you see. and the core starts becoming its power: again you increase the core, it starts again to go out to periphery and the things start mentally. That is how the attention if you can understand is. And that attention, which is enlightened in you, has to be kept all the time enlightened. No justification of yourself. Because that also we do not have to justify - it's alright to think that we must grow, we must be alright, must be very good. And when we find somebody is troubling us, it's rather difficult to tolerate nonsense like that. It is sure, but for that I am sitting down, you just tell Me. They can manage it you see we have solved one problem very nicely. And we can solve all the problems.

Very clever way, isn't it? That [ ]. It just gets solved you see. So we don't have to worry about anything. You don't have to think a 100 times: no I am the person I'll put you in problems you see I'll tell you do like this you should have done like this, you should have put in effort like this. but the problem I will be solving Myself but I will make you run up and down to see that. On the contrary when you see Me doing like that you should understand I am going to explain. So the problems can be solved just like that if your attention is subtle. But if it is not the main the basic problem is that you can not approach it. The approach to the problem is only possible if you are a subtle being.

If you are not a subtle being you can not approach any problem. So, to be subtle and to be there, to be divine one has to understand the grossness that is covering you. Through Kundalini you can because you can raise your Kundalini and see where it is hanging. Now it's very heavy here it's like a stone here its thumping here. It's doing all these things. Now, it's a very gross way of looking at it. Very gross way of looking at it - it is suggesting to you something. So what you have to do is to see for yourself now at Sahasrara. That's the place for Somebody we know. Just sit down and say now what have I done after all?

Why this problem am I having? If I have done anything like that, please forgive me, it works out. It is a simple way but first of all, foremost thing what is the substance you gave Me? Is it the subtle substance that is speaking or the gross one? From which point are you speaking is the thing. Supposing you are speaking from that point where you are the government general, everybody has to obey but if you are speaking from the point where you are a fume what is going to obey? So where is the attention is the thing, so mentally you have to work it out in your meditation. Now sit down for meditation, alright mostly try to be thoughtlessly aware but if there are thoughts you should try to keep it out by saying how fortunate that I have felt these vibrations, I felt it, and how happy I am about it now you get away all the negative thoughts that is how you can fight it out. Now whatever you do will lead you to Sahaja, not before. Before realisation it has got no meaning because a dead car standing there but now the car has started moving.

And whatever you do whatever you try, it will make you subtler and subtler. Simple things like declaration part is that I am going to do this, I have decided to do that. Put your mind to positive thinking. What are we going to do? How are we going to do it? How are we going to work it out? You will be surprised how the things will drop but normally our habits are for our gross problems. Now I would say Bombay Sahaja Yogis are quite developed they are quite good. [ ] really tumbled down very badly. This time I thought they were a little bit proud than anything else because Delhi people were not so good at things there, they have to come and do it and I think they [ ] that so they were sort of elderly [handful] Delhi people.

It happened. But then... they found themselves [fight more] and and all of them Humpty-dumties sitting down there you see so it can happen. So anyone who feels that I have achieved everything or I have wished anything can have a Humpty-Dumpty form, because you see it was so beautifully [playing] you see. I'll tel you what happened they came down and then in the Old Delhi we had no place to stay properly so I said alright you arrange My place in the guest house and the guests stay in the boys hostel and the girls can stay in the girls hostel - it's alright it can be done. So then the gross thing came out. So one of the persons said that she [ ] food [to do] that boys hostel is full of oil and this and how can we eat there? And I did not know about it - nobody told Me. And then they have to arrange [ ] somebody and they have to suddenly purchase all the food and everything and then to arrange a cook and these things. And where they stayed was all full of bhoots. They were all caught up in the head terrible like this and that going to Me.

They said Mother what has happened to us? You know we came all the way and this is what has happened. Now we are all vomiting, this and that. I said why? Where are you eating these days? Not in that oil place? No, we have our own cook we have our everything but the problem is the house is full of bhoots and we are all finished with that. So I said who had asked you to suggest that? Can't you eat that food? So many thousands of boys are eating here.

You are Sahaja Yogis you can't eat that food? Your attention is on the oily food what is so special about yourselves that you can't eat? I mean you should be able to eat even the stones. That what Sahaja Yoga is but you can't eat the ordinary food that all so many thousands were eating? And you wanted to stay away - such importance of yourself - so void - and it was all done by satanic forces. You should have thought once at least that why are we wanting to go away from here that place where it is all organized? Let us be here. That is Sahaja. That part also they did not understand. You see discrimination also what is Sahaja what is asahaja?

Where are you sahaja where are you not. You should discriminate it. That point at least going to reach. So the so called the high top class Sahaja Yogis fell down rough like that. And they felt very shy about it. I said it's alright don't you worry but it is a simple thing. It's a lesson now. Because there are, we can overcome food problems but what about the bhoots? Why should you go in with somebody - a person who has just come to Sahaja Yoga and you do not know what sort of person he is. They said Mother, it's your Maya.

I said: "But what about you?" You people are thinking that you are great - that you are the greatest sahaja yogis ever born. And you are are the top most among all. [It' the worst ] you don't think like this. And this is what happens... You see, so it plays on you just to test you and you.. it works for you. So you see Sahaja means whatever comes your way you take - no doubt but you do it yourself with positiveness that is very necessary. That does not mean you go on accepting everything sahaja - the roots are coming out of me - I am accepting everything coming out of me I am accepting. That is not the way it is Sahaja. That is the point. You see when we start doing like then... actually sahaja what you will get is bhoots.

and what you will get is all the [head tikki] and also you will get all the sickness, illness everything. You have to be careful. So mentally you should be alert. Physically you should work it out and physically there is another point that you must look after your body physically. Very much necessary because this body is the temple of God. It is definitely not a temple, it is a shrine you see how beautiful shrine [ ] and I'd love to reside in this place, let it be so beautiful that God resides here. Beautiful - look after your body, look after your hair. Look after yourself, if you treat yourself there is no harm. People might say that why should I treat myself I must take all the [ ] on myself, all these out of date ideas of suffering are useless for Sahaja Yoga. Nobody has to suffer.

We have to be very very healthy people. Like somebody said that why is it that I am Krishna [Parama ] did not cure himself? Because he did not know how to cure himself, first of all. But [ ] Krishna said I want to take all the [bolux ] on my head. You do not get sick from somebody who is sick you do not get sick. The only thing if you look after your body you respect your body then your body also respects you. You body understands if you do not care for your body you neglect your body then body also says alright I'll have [malignancy] So you have to look after your body you have to know how to keep it alright. I think we should really write it down all the things that have to be done - look after your body. That is very important because in these modern times or modern society, of course, you have devised ways of comfort that you press here then you have everything coming down best hair having, get food coming inside your stomach and all that is there but you not get [ ]. That is all comfort they call it but I call it lethargy.

or [ ] laziness it is not going to give you good health. Good health is possible only if you understand the balance in the person every understanding about how the body acts and what happens to body, small, small things. Like hot and cool, cold and hot - this is very important for Sahaja Yoga. You see Sahaja Yogis have to be perfect. Absolutely perfect. And you do not have to do with the norms of the body types that everybody should be thin. And everybody should be absolutely TB patient throwing downward for some sort of, what you call it, beauty parade. You should be all very healthy people and impressive. You see whenever you sit there people should literally be frightened of you: from where these wrestlers have come? So this is the sign of attending to your health attending yourself and your mental health also and that is why I say be that you careful as to what you read and what you see and what you hear and how much attention you pay to it.

You see supposing now a person like David comes here, you see, you pay too much attention to a man like that, everything is filled with that the whole atmosphere is talking about it. Everybody is worried about it, it is all going on - it's negative. I think you talked more about David than about Me at that time because I have also come when David was there, but you see sort of thing is - it happens. Because we are used to see everything like a sensational thing going on, you see. Like a newspapers will only publish something sensational we are used to sensation. So Mister David was quite important. But just see how unimportant he is, see, just disappears. So if you just neglected him and not bothered very much not pay any attention to him [ ] I hope Culie is not too long with the [colour] he is scholar. See, I do not know who he used to be... glorying him and get him into trouble... So the regular habits of sitting in the water and all that should be done.

Also regular habits about your mind. Is not to read this just avoid you do not want to read anymore of this. There is so many beautiful books you can read like if you have to read any sort of [ ] you are used to, you can read. Beautiful books I have told you so many of them are there you can read the Bible. And see for yourself that it is all Sahaja. Every word you can find so many quotations and so many things which can help us to tell these christians otherwise they are not going to listen to this, they are such conformed sort of things that you have to tell something from the Bible. Then read Koran, you can read other books also. Like Halil Gibran, which are supporting you, which are also helping you which are giving you ideas. Are you alright? Sure?

- Sure. - I think better put your left hand towards Me and right hand outside.
