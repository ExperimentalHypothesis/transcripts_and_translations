I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot talk about it, we cannot conceptualise it. We have to feel it on our central nervous system. That is what is called (? buddh), from where the word “Buddha” has come. In the early Christians’ era the Christians were called as Gnostics, about which Saint Thomas has written when he went to India. The “know” word comes from the Sanskrit word which means “to know” (the word). So not to know, mentally, but to know on your central nervous system. So at our human awareness we cannot know the truth. We have to become a subtler being. We have to be born again, as they say. But it’s not just a certificate, that we are born again. It is the last breakthrough of our evolution, where we become the Spirit. It is the becoming which is very important.

Now you are getting exposed to religions and you have to understand that whatever religion you may follow, you can commit any sin. (Shri Mataji speaks to the translator: Whatever religion one may follow, they be Hindu, Muslim, can commit any sin.) Because righteousness is not awakened within you. That has to be awakened. If you just condition yourself, and just feel that you are born again, you are sadly mistaken. It is of no advantage. Now within us is based the power [to] achieve that state of Spirit. So the fundamental truth about you is that you are the Spirit, not this body, not this mind. Nor you are your ego, nor your conditionings. So we have to be prepared, desirous of becoming the Spirit.

The second truth is that there is a certain all-pervading power which does all living work. You see these beautiful flowers and you take them for granted. But we do not think that these flowers have come out of one small little seed. How it has come? We have become human beings from amoeba stage. Look at our eyes. What a micro-camera it is. How have we developed it? It is some force within us, around us, which has brought to it; this evolution. But we have not reached the absolute truth. If there was absolute truth there would have been to quarrel about anything. So all this living work is done by this all-pervading power. And when this Kundalini, this power rises within you then you can feel this all-pervading power as cool vibrations.

Tomorrow is the day of one of our poets’ anniversary, of Rabindranath Tagore. And he stayed in your country for quite some time. And I think this all-pervading power has arranged [for] me to be here. To pay my homage to him. He has talked about the same thing, in the first half of (? his) life, that “I’m seeking the truth, I can’t find it, it’s hiding.” And the second half he had described that he has now found the truth and what has happened to him.

So when you become the Spirit, what happens to you is very important. The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty. Before knowing about it, whether you believe in God or do not believe makes no difference. Because if you believe in God blindly it’s just the same as not believing. But better to be open minded like scientists and find out. If you find out then you have to believe.

And this Kundalini is power which connects you to this all-pervading power. It’s the reflection of the Primordial Mother. We have God the Father and God the Son. But no Mother. In the Bible Christ’s Mother is described just as “woman”. But there were many people, who came from traditions, they started calling her as Madonna. So in the Christian religion they just avoided to talk about Madonna or to talk about Mother. But how can there be a Father and a Son, and a dove the Holy Ghost? And they say this Holy Ghost is a mystery. This Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother. That all the old, ancient cultures knew about. The old cultures like the Greek culture have called her as Athena. “Atha” means “the Primordial”.

So this Primordial Mother, the Holy Ghost, is reflected within us as Kundalini. She is your individual mother. And she resides in all of you. Actually this bone is called as Sacrum, meaning “sacred”. And if you are (unclear), you will get your self-realisation. If you are (unclear) this Kundalini will be awakened, and you will get your self-realisation. It is important because this is the last breakthrough of our evolution. If it does not happen we are doomed to get lost. Because when this power awakens it nourishes all the six centres through which it passes. And gives you self-realisation. But above all, it nourishes all the centres with (? mighty) power. Thus your physical, mental, emotional problems are solved.

We have three doctors in India who got their MD in Sahaja Yoga. Three doctors got MD in Sahaja Yoga (unclear) in incurable diseases. Like that we have to understand that all these troubles of human beings are because they’re ignorant about their self. When the light of the Spirit comes into our attention, the attention gets enlightened. Not only that you feel the cool breeze around you but you can very easily feel your own centres on your fingertips. Also you can feel the centres of another person. So this is a new dimension of awareness you achieved which is called as collective consciousness. So you become collectively conscious, you become. So you are empowered then to correct those centres. Thus you can correct yourself and you can correct others. This is how it is going to be for the benevolence of the whole humanity.

We have in Sahaja Yoga people from fifty-five nations. We are Russians, Germans. English, Americans, Indians, in thousands. But when they meet in thousands there’s no arguments, there’s no fighting, there’s no jealousies. All these baser things are finished. And such a feeling of compassion and love. That when I went to Russia, there were twenty-five Germans who came rushing to help me. And they felt that love and responsibility.

So we have to know that this is the Resurrection Time. And that you are to be resurrected. This is the Last Judgment. Those people who are trying to make money in the name of God, murder people, all kinds of mafia and all that, all such people will be judged. And those who are real seekers of truth and honest people will be resurrected. We all have that divinity within us. We should not get lost with any propaganda or anything, but we must ask for the actualisation of the experience.

When the Kundalini rises, then from the fontanelle bone area you feel a cool breeze coming out, this is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. And first time you feel this all-pervading power. Then you start growing in your divinity. Of course you get rid of all bad habits, all maladies in your body. Your brain becomes enlightened, your body becomes enlightened. You don’t feel tired, but you all the time feel extremely energetic and dynamic. But at the same time you are extremely compassionate and loving. This is – the blessings now which are working out in fifty-five nations. As this is a living process, we cannot pay for it. Like we can pay for the hall, but we cannot pay for awakening your Kundalini. Cannot pay for self-realisation. All those people who take money in the name of God are absolutely cheating themselves and cheating others.

I’m sorry I am here only for one day with you, and the whole knowledge of Sahaja Yoga cannot be explained in such a short time. But see there are so many lights here, and if you have to put on them, just you have to switch, put one switch on and all (unclear). So this power is built in within you. Only thing is, it has to be awakened. And once it is awakened, that light of your Spirit, you will be able to understand everything very well. You will know very well how you are related to each other. But I must tell you, it cannot be forced. We cannot organise it. It has to happen.

I’m sure most of you will get your self-realisation. It will take about ten to fifteen minutes (? to work). If you all want it we could start but if you want to ask some questions you are welcome. But ask questions which are related to the subject. Because I’ve not come here to take anything from you. I’ve not come here to take anything from you. But to give you the key of your happiness and joy. Of course I can answer all your questions but it’s just a mental (unclear). So I would have to repeat you ask the questions which are related to Sahaja Yoga.

Seeker: I would like to ask for your advice on how we should relate to the harsh aggressions that are manifested in the world? How can we relate ourselves to it so as to not become aggressive as well?

Shri Mataji: After self-realisation, the situation becomes like this: that if your attention is on the periphery, then it’s like a wheel and you are moving with the wheel. But if your attention is on the axis, on the centre, it is silent. So when you become the Spirit you don’t react at all. But you become the witness of the play. And you watch. And your watching is so powerful that it has an effect on the environment.

Seeker: I would like to ask what the meaning of the word “akash” is in the Sanskrit language? (unclear)

Shri Mataji: All right I’ll explain to you later, it’s a very big subject to talk about. First of all you get your realisation.

Seeker: The question is, Shri Mataji, that what do you mean by someone accepting money in the name of God?

Shri Mataji: What is there to explain, it’s simple like that? Like many false gurus have come from my country, and there are many who are all around, to everybody they say give (? to) God. God doesn’t know money.

Seeker: It is said that for the rich man it’s so hard to go through the gates of Heaven as it is for the camel to go through the needle. So I’m asking a/the question: how come that all religious organisations of today’s world are functioning like that?

Shri Mataji: I agree. It’s dangerous but time has come for to end them all. It’s the tolerance of people. Because we have tolerated all this nonsense. I agree. When the light will come darkness will disappear.

Seeker: Mother I would like to ask you, how can we become real Yogis? But (unclear), but it’s the way of becoming real Yogis.

Shri Mataji: He’s a great seeker (unclear) who wants to know what makes us a real Yogi. You see the – as I have told you the growth takes place within ourselves. And the thoughts, when we react, disturb the peace. So when the Kundalini passes through this Agnya chakra, though this centre, that it sucks in the two sides of the Ego and our conditionings. As a result we become thoughtlessly aware, we are aware but we are thoughtless. And when we become thoughtlessly aware we are in the present. Neither in the past, nor in the future. At that time the growth takes place. In Sahaja Yoga you will know so many ways of establishing that silence. That is how we are going to grow. Into another state that we call as doubtless awareness. In Sanskrit it is called Nirvikalpa Samadhi. In that state you become empowered. You can give realisation to others. You can cure others. You can know all the absolute knowledge within yourself. That is the state of complete freedom.

Seeker: I would like to ask if there are any outside things that obstruct or help the practice of Sahaja Yoga, such as food or drink or lifestyle or ideology?

Shri Mataji: There are no restrictions at all, of any kind. But you become your own masters. And you become your own guide. For some people carbohydrates are more suitable, for some people proteins are more suitable. That you will find out yourself. That is what is self-knowledge.

Seeker: I would like to ask you, what do you think of the end of the world? Many people say nowadays that within ten or maybe fifteen years we arrive to this last day, when there will be some kind of catastrophe or something like that. So what do you think of this? Is there anything like this coming towards us or not?

Shri Mataji: It’s not true. They are just frightening you to make some money perhaps.

Seeker: But you see there are signs of this, and for example these things that are happening – waters and floods and other natural catastrophes are the signs, earthquakes and so on are the signs of these times.

Shri Mataji: They are just – earthquakes have been always there. (unclear) Only thing is that man must be – human beings have to be afraid of themselves, the way they are behaving. There is no problem from the Nature as from the human beings themselves. What we need is the transformation of human beings. Because all problems arise from them. It’s all due to ignorance. (unclear) ignorance it’s all due to.

Seeker: (inaudible)

Shri Mataji: Yes there is, of course. There’s a – with the sick people there is a little problem. But it can be overcome.

Seeker: (inaudible)

Shri Mataji: We should now talk about the present. I have – because you see, these are subjects we are dealt with, there are three or four thousand lectures of mine. Everything cannot be told in a short period but of course you will understand everything gradually.

Seeker: My last question, I promise. What is your opinion about the Yogic life – the relation of Yogic life and free sex? Having sex with anyone.

Shri Mataji: A Yogi cannot have free sex. Impossible. He can marry, he can have children, he can (? regret) but he won’t because he’s a wise person. He doesn’t want to get AIDS and all kinds of horrible diseases. He has to work for the benevolence of people. We should see the countries which are suffering today because of stupid ideas – of Mr. Freud. Because he was born of the antichrist, you see. Christ has said: “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”, even that. To that subtle extent the purity he described. And this horrible fellow talks of such horrible things that we Indians cannot digest it. And he has created this problem of so many horrible diseases in America. And people have gone amok now. They’re gone amok, they’ve lost their balance completely. But this sanity, this purity, this sense of chastity comes to you when you become a Yogi, automatically. Your eyes really become, as Christ has said, innocent. And they are so powerful. Because they are so pure. There is no lust and greed in those eyes. And every glance of such a person can create peace, joy and purity.

(unclear) There’s a question now, why big dinosaurs disappeared? There are many already in the society, they all have to disappear.

Seeker: (inaudible)

Shri Mataji: The first question is that, the diseases can be cured by Indian doctors? I mean, they were cured, by Indian doctors, and they got their remedy. They were cured actually. But it was as a by-product of self-realisation.

The second question is that, am I a doctor? I did medicine, of course, but I’m not a doctor. Because I don’t follow the way medical science is. But which is beyond medical science, Sahaja Yoga is beyond medical science. It explains everything and it attends to the roots of the trouble.

The third question is that, can anyone raise the Kundalini? Yes of course, if you become a Sahaja Yogi, you can not only raise the Kundalini but you can also cure people. In Russia there are forty doctors who practice in Sahaja Yog. In Moscow itself. And in Tolyatti there are forty thousand Sahaja Yogis. Whatever might have been the problems of the governments, but people in Russia are extremely introspective. I’m to always book a stadium – always book a stadium for them. And so many of them are scientists, and of very high quality, who are Sahaja Yogis. Spiritually they are very rich people.

Now I think we should stop talking. Because you want to have your realisation, you want to have your realisation now.

It will take about ten to fifteen minutes. I’ve already requested that I cannot force it on you. It has to work out. So you have to know one more thing; that you all can get it, your self-realisation. You should have full confidence in yourself. There are two conditions you have to fulfil. One is not to feel guilty at all about yourself. It’s a fashion I think, in Europe especially, to feel guilty all time. After all you are human beings, you’re not God. If you have done any mistakes, it’s all right. And do you know that this all-pervading power of love is the ocean of forgiveness? And whatever mistakes you can commit, it is so powerful that it can forgive everything. Those people who tell you that you are like this or like that are actually – I think must be wanting (? to earn) money. So don’t believe them. Have faith in yourself. And you forget the past now. Whatever wrong you’re supposed to have done is nothing. But do you know, if you feel guilty then this centre catches on the left side? And gives you horrible diseases like angina, spondylitis. So why should we feel guilty? Let the Kundalini decide.

Second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Many people say it’s very difficult. But whether you forgive or don’t forgive, what do you do? Reason it out. Logically, you don’t do anything. But when you don’t forgive you play to wrong hands and torture yourself. Those who have troubled you are happy, while you are torturing yourself unnecessarily. So what is the use of not forgiving? And don’t think of them. Just (unclear) say: “Mother, I forgive everyone.” I tell you, you will feel very much lighter. You’ll feel very much lighter. These are the two conditions. These are all mental conditionings. And can be easily swept away.

So now, you have to understand that we have two sides: left and right. And the left side is for our desire, and the right side for our action. So please, if you don’t mind, you will have to take off your shoes because you can’t take the help from the Mother Earth. Those who are sitting on the ground are all right. But otherwise, others should keep their left and right feet away from each other.

I’ll show you first how to raise the Kundalini. Sahaja Yoga is very comfortable. You don’t have to go to Himalayas, you don’t have to renounce anything, you don’t have to fast. And sitting on the chair you can get your realisation. Because you are so worthy. But you have to sit at least straight, not too much bending or too much crouching in front.

So we put our left hand on our lap on the left-hand side. Left hand on the left lap, left side. Towards me, symbolising that you desire to have your self-realisation. And you have to use your right hand for nourishing your centres on the left-hand side. First of all, you put your right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the Spirit. If you are the Spirit you become your guide, your master. So you please take your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side, which is the centre for your mastery. Then you take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Which is the centre of pure knowledge that works out all the divine powers. Now again raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now raise your right hand on your heart. Then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. And turn your head to the right. And I’ve told you that this centre is caught up when you feel guilty. Now please take your right hand on your forehead across. And bend your head as far as possible. This is the centre where you have to forgive everyone in general. Please take back your right hand, backside of your head, and push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power. Now stretch your palm please. And put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area, which is the soft bone of your childhood. Now please stretch back your fingers as far as possible. And please bow down your head. Now move your scalp. Seven times, slowly, clockwise. (? Put pressure.) That’s all you have to do. Please remember to push back your fingers.

Now all of you have to do it. All those who do not want to have self-realisation should please leave the hall. Also in-between please don’t disturb others.

You have to now close your eyes. Put your left hand towards me on your lap, and right hand on your heart. And please do not open your eyes until I tell you. Here resides the Spirit. Now I already told you that the fundamental truth about you is that you are the Spirit. So you please ask me a question, a fundamental question, three times. You can call me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like. Please ask three times in your heart: “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Three times. Now if you are the Spirit you are your master. So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. Here you ask me another fundamental question: “Mother, am I my own master?” Three times.

I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom, as you have to have a complete freedom. I cannot force pure knowledge on you, you have to ask me in the glory of your freedom. So now take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. And here you ask six times because this centre has got six sub-plexuses, six petals: “Mother, please give me pure knowledge.” As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising. So we have to nourish the higher centres with our self-confidence. So raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here you have to say, with full confidence, ten times: “Mother, I am my own master.” I have already told you that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this Ego, you are not this conditioning. You are pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart, and with full confidence you have to say, twelve times: “Mother, I am the Spirit.” This all-pervading power is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of absolute knowledge. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. So all your mistakes can be easily dissolved by this power. So please raise your hand into the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. At this centre with full confidence you have to say: “Mother, I am not guilty at all.” Sixteen times. I’ve already told you that, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But, if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. So you have to forgive. Forgive everyone in general, without thinking individually about them. So now please raise your right hand on top of your forehead, and bend your head as far as possible. Here, not how many times but from your heart, you have to say: “Mother, I forgive everyone, in general.” This centre is very constricted and if you don’t say this your Kundalini may not pierce through. Please take your right hand now on the backside of your head, and push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, say: “Mother, All-pervading Power, if I have made any mistakes, please forgive me. Say from your heart, and not how many times. Now stretch your palm. And put the centre of your palm on your fontanelle bone area. Now please put down your head and stretch back your fingers, so you have a nice pressure on your scalp. Here again, I cannot force you the self-realisation. You have to ask for it. So please move your scalp. Put down your head and move your scalp, with pressure seven times clockwise, saying seven times: “Mother, please give me self-realisation.”

Now please take down your hands, and open your eyes. Put your hands towards me like this. Then put the right hand like this towards me and bend your head, and see for yourself there’s a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area. It could be hot, if you have not forgiven. But please don’t put your hand on top of the head. Away from it, bend your head. Some people get it far away. Now please put your left hand towards me. And bend your head again. And see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming. Doesn’t matter if there is hot coming. Now again try once more, with the right hand. (? Again it) with the left hand.

Now please put both your hands towards the sky, and push back your head. And ask any one of these questions three times in your heart: “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”, or “Mother, is this the all-pervading power of divine love?”, or “Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?” Any one of them, you ask the question three times. Now please take down your hands. Put your hands please towards me. And watch me without thinking. This is thoughtless awareness.

Now all those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their hands or fingers or out of their fontanelle bone, please raise both your hands. All those who have felt cool breeze out of your hands, or hot. All of you have felt it. I bow to you. Now the new growth has started. Enjoy yourselves. Of course, I would like to meet some of you if you want to meet me now.
