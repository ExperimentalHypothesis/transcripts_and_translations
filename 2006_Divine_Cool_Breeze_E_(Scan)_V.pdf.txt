 Fava Shakti of World Expresses deepest Love and Sincerity to Our Divine Mother (Cheswick U.K. 17th June 2006) We have just come out of Mother's living room in Her house in Cheswick, U.K. in and bowed down before Mother, Sir CP again remarked, Shri Mataji gave blessings to chocolate that was distributed and the Yuva Shakti and Mother asked everyone to come into the room. Sir CP Spoke of ourresponsibility in the world and our devotion to Shri Mataji Shri Mataji is leaving tomorrow for Italy. Tonight the UK Sahaja Yoga Committee offered deepest love and gratitude to our Mother during Her here in the heart of the Universe. and one Yuva Shakti remarked that our devotion stay to Shri Mataji would last all of our lives. With chocolate in our mouths we began to sing Jai Ganesh with as many other Yogis who were able to stand in the room and in the doorways. Mother was very pleased and said "Thank You" to everyone. We prayed all together out loud for our Holy Mother's good health and long life and bowed down to Her lotus feet. We floated out of the room on vibrations and bubbled into The Yuva Shakti followed, at first three Yuva Shakti entering Mother's room and offering a four petal led gold and red card inset with poetry of thanks and commitment to the Divine, along with a baked cake and framed photograph taken of some 75 Yuva Shakti on Tuesday 13th June in the living room of the Yuva Shakti ashram shortly after Shri Mataji's visit earlier this week. Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. read the poems within the card, gave their blessings and Sir recalled the night at the Yuva House. the kitchen and Garden. Thank you Mother with all our deepest hearts and sincerity for gracing our lives with your love, your vibrations, your vision and the opportunity to participate and carry out your work. The three Yuva Shakti inside the room were immediately joined by about 15 more who came Jai shri Mataji (Internet Version)

 Soma's stay in Chiswick in Shri Mataji's house for more than a month (Chiswick - U.K. - 18 June, 2006) It was such a blessing for me to cook for Shri Mataji for more than a month. It was the most precious time ofmy life. on Buddha Purnima Day and Rohit was also there, so we saing Mata ka Karam again infront of Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. It started on 5th of May (Sahasrara Day). Me and Pramila left the Puja site to cook in Mother's house. As soon as we reached the house, Aunty Saxena (Incharge of kitchen from India) said that today is Sahasrara day, so make every possible nice thing for Devi's Bhog. So we made lots of things from our heart. In the evening with some other Austrian brothers and sisters, we had the opportunity to attend a small puja in presence of Shri Mataji and sang Bhajans. It was always my desire to sing Sahasrara Swamini in front of Shri Mataji and it happened like this that I could sing Sahasrara Swamini on Sahasrara Day with the bhajan group. We also sang Mata ka karam, which Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. liked very much. Next day was Mother's Day. There were offerings from different countries. Austrians also brought beautiful cakes and flowers. On that day an amazing thing happened: around 12 o'clock in the night Shri Mataji asked for Aarti Hereself. We all ran up in the living room and sang Aarti. It was like a Pujaand Shri Mataji was wearing the Austrian Shawl which is a collective effort of all the ladies inAustria. Sabine was also there. So we were so happy. Later on when I had an opportunity to cook with Kalpana Didi, she said that the shawl is made with so muchheart and Amma (Shri Mataji) liked it very much. This shawl and Scarf were wom by Shri Mataji quite a few times whenever She went out. On 7th, on Sahasrara Puja day, I went to cook again. Aunty said make different kinds of sweets for prasad. We started making different types of sweets one after the other. Some sweets I made first time and they all tumed out very nice. I felt as if I was not doing anything and Shri Mataji was doing all. Bengal is very famous for sweets, as I come from that part of India I felt that Shri Mataji is working out something through this. The Austrian Mother's day card was always in the bedroom of Shri Mataji as a piece of decoration, just opposite of Her chair. Aren't the Austrians lucky? Once Shri Mataji was sitting on dinning table during breakfast just infront of the kitchen door. We were all busy preparing breakfast. She looked at all of us. We all did namaskar, it was a very nice Darshan. Next day when I came to Shri Mataji's house Bhanu asked so where is the boy who sang Mata ka karam so nicely, Sir C.P. wants him to be here. It was Rohit, Sir C.P. liked his style of singing. So Rohit had to fly back again from Austria. We had a very beautiful Buddha Puja Kalpana Didi was there for some days, we had opportunity to cook with here for three days. We cooked together: Akhni pulao, Kashmiri chicken, Keema, Egg curry, moongdal vada. She told us that most of them are from Shri Mataji's recipe.

 The Divine Cool Breeze Issue: 9 & 10-2006 all the Yuvas. It was a wonderful evening. Suddenly Shri Mataji said that She did not want to go in the wheel chair and She wants to walk, and really She came walking from Living room to bedroom. It was the most extra-ordinary event. The whole house was bubbling with joy, everybody saying Shri Mataji is walking! Since then She always walked from the bedroom to the living room We often sat in the corridor while Shri Mataji was sitting in the living room and watching something in T.V. We watched a few Hindi films together: Lagaan, Mugal-E-Azam, Dil Chahata Hai... Once we watched Sahasrara Puja 2006 and sang aarti, it was very nice. Often when we were free we used to meditate on the lawn facing Shri mataji's bedroom window, or just infront of Shri Mataji's room. Such deep meditations we had! and back. On 7th June we (kitchen team) went to offer flowers to Shri Mataji. We all did Pranam. It was such a nice moment! Sir C.P. said you all cook so many things, nice food and you are spoiling us. It was a very nice Darshan. Once Shri Mataji played harmonium Herself, we all ran up from the kitchen to see that, it was a wonderful scene. Then Sir C.P. sang two lines of Gazal: "Dil me kisi ke rah kiye ja raha hun main, kaisa haseen gunah kiye ja raha hun main". It was so nice, such a wonderful evening! Just like a music programme in heaven. Before Kalpana didi left she gave valuable gifts to everybody in the house. She called me in her room and opened here hand: a pair of very beautiful golden earrings with rubies. I said its too much. She said its mother's blessings. I was in tears. She hugged me and said Austria has a nice collective and Wolfgang is a very nice person. Then she said see you in Cabella. It was an unforgettable moment. On 8th June we watched the Austrian Bahajan DVD first time together with Shri Mataji. We sat in the corridor and Shri Mataji in the living room. Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. both liked the Bhajans. I was sitting and singing, and I felt that I am sitting and singing with the other Austrians. It was an amazing moment. I was so proud to be Austrian. After that many a times Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. watched that DVD and specially the song 'Mata Ka Karam'. Even on the 2nd day of evening programme of Adishakti Puja She watched Mata Ka Karam'and again when She came back after puja She listened to the same song. Isn't it amazing? Once Fench Yuva Shaktis came to give gifts on the occassion of their Mother's Day and they sang a very soft and sweet song which was very touching. We were sitting in Shri Mataji's dining area and watching. It was very nice. On the Adishakti Puja Day we had feet washing ceremony of Mother in the morning. It was like asmall Puja. Then they asked five ladies of the house to bring the laxmi baskets to Shri Mataji. I was one of them. Me and Aunty were carrying beautiful Cranberry glass sets. We offered it to Shri Mataji and did Pranam. She was very happy. Sir C.P. said these cranbery glass things are very precious. I felt that I had the most On 6th June the Yuva Shaktis came to sing Bahajans. They sang very beautifully. The whole house was full of joy and charged with vibrations. Sir C.P. talked to the Yuvas and asked them to spread Sahaja among the Young generation. They presented pictures of the Yuva Shakti Ashram. After that Sir C.P. said to feed

 Issue: 9 & 10 - 2006 The Divine Cool Breeze precious moment of my life. When we came out Rachel was asking me about the shopping list and I said Rachel I can't think anymore, Rachel said the same. After sometime we For more than a month I had the opportunity to serve God Herself. It was the most precious time of my life. Icould make Breakfast, lunch, dinner, chai andeverything whatever was in my heart and whatever Shri Mataji wanted. Working there I felt that as if I am not doing anything. She is giving the ideas and I amjust moving my hands. There were many things which I made there first time but everything tumed out nicely. Once we had to get the dinner ready in 45 minutes which is normally quiet impossible, but everything was finished at the right time. So, She does it all. started again to make shopping list, to cook and so on. On the Puja day, together with some Indian food, I could make Austrian Schnitzel. After Shri Mataji had lunch we all got ready for Puja and waited outside, so that when She goes in the car we will also jump in the van. When Shri Mataji was going in the car we all did namaskar and She raised Her hand for blessings. It was amazing. We went to the Puja and for the first time in my life I was sitting in the first row. Shri Mataji was very happy during the Puja and after Puja, when we were dancing with the qawali in front of Mother, She was smiling at us. So sweet.... When I came back I felt that I came back from heaven to earth. It was really a different world there. The birds always singing, beautiful blossoms everywhere. Everything was beyond time there. Sometimes the dinner used to be finished by 4 in the moming, sometimes half past two or three. Everything was so beautiful. We were always full with joy and vibrations. What more a Sahaj Yogi wants.... That's was my stay in Heaven on Earth. We came back home made the dinner ready. It was my last day. When Shri Mataji finished dinner. I said bye bye to everybody. I was in tears and felt that I am going away from my parent's house to in-law's place.I didn't cry so much when I had to leave India even. Jai Shri Mataji Soma (Internet Version) Shri Mataji Hosts Informal Farewell Programme (U.K. -18th June, 2006) special way. Sir C P. recounted two amusing tales from his youth and Shri Mataji was presented with a brochure of a prospective property for a new UK national centre. It was a wonderful time for all. From: loana Popa (Internet Version) Shri Mataji graciously hosted an informal programme of farewell with the UK SY committee members and the Yuva Shakti on the eve of Her departure to Italy. The committee were given some beautiful gifts from Shri Mataji, and the Yuva Shakti sang to Her in their own

 History created as our Mother visited yuva-shakti ashram in London To Bless The YuvaShakti Dear Sahajis, As you know, yesterday, Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. came to the Yuvashakti Ashram in Lodnon to see and bless it. and asked us with a smile: "Do you agree?" .and everybody said out clearly and loudly: "Yes!" It was really amazing, there presence was so beautiful, I can'teven describe it in words. They arrived at around 8.30 pm and all of us were awaiting them in the living room, squelched together, but very excited. We got up and started singing "Swagata Agata". It was quite amazing, and then he said. "If you like, you may as well sing a bhajan!" and of course, having prepared the bhajans, we started singing: "Jai Jagadambe Aye Re, Meri Nirmal Maa" and after that Mother drank some water and was saying "Ah!"... Baap Re... "Ah!" after like every sip of water. There vibrations were so strong, it was awesome. The car arrived and all the uncles and aunties came into the living room to check ifeverything was alright. And the Mother came in first, sitting in the wheelchair and Sir C.P. followed. .... then Sir C.P. talked to us again "It all started here for the Western world, the Sahaj Movement" and then he said "we hope, that by this day today (13 June 2006) there will be a new start in the same way!" Then he said, "We will take leave now". and everybody looked with big eyes.. and then he said "but if you want, you can sing another bahajan for 5 minutes" and we all started singing "Jago Savera Aya Hai, Mata Ne Bulaya Hai". Mother asked us to sit down and said "Baith Jao" (=sit down) in Hindi and we were just blasted by the vibrations. Then Mother was watching us and we were just sitting there... and then Sir C.P. stared off saying: "Do you know why we came here today? We came here, because She wanted to come here. We came here, because it was important to her. After that, they took leave and said "We really enjoyed our stay here in the U.K. and we will certainly come back again". She came to this country (meaning the U.K.) in 1974 to spread the word of Love and started Sahaja Yoga for the Western world. She has been travelling for 35 years in all the continents. Everybody clapped and we sang "Mataji, Mataji... Your face shines like a thousand suns, you have give us more than we could ask for, Bliss and Peace and Harmony" Now She wants to pass on the responsibility to you, the Yuvashakti, the future of Sahaja Yoga! Afterwards we were all enjoying each other's company and actually could'nt really believe what just had happened.. "She came here today to give her blessings! She wants You to take over and to spread the message of Sahaja Yoga" Lots of love from London (Internet version) Then he looked at her, and looked back at us:

 Adi Shakti Puja (Cheswick U.K. 11th June, 2006) Speech by Sir Chandrika Prasad Srivastava after the gift-session: (A Transcript) "May I first bow down to the Goddess, may I bow down to all of you angels. This is a gathering of angels on earth and I am very fortunate to be a part of it. I am deeply and profoundly grateful to all the Sahajayogis and Yoginis of United Kingdom and of allof the world, that they gave us an opportunity to be here. Ever since our arrival in the United Kingdom we have been looked after with absolute utmost love, affection and care. It is impossible to describe to you our feelings of gratitude and, you know, it's like home coming. So, Dr. Spiro to you, to all, everyone I want to convey of our feelings of deepest love and abiding of profound gratitude. Her message, the message of Sahaja Yoga which is made of Love which unites men and women and children of all the countries as one human family. For She has now, my children, you take over that responsibility, spread the message of Sahaja Yoga, and so 2 years ago She decided to establisha World Council for the Advancement of Sahajayoga and that council has been functioning. And since then She has also requested, invited and urged all Sahajayogis from the world to form collective leadership to involve as many as possible in the task of spreading Sahajayoga, and that has been done. In the United Kingdom thereisa collective body now and in many countries of the world. That collective body, collectively Sahajayogis and Sahajayoginis, are now spreading the message of Sahajayoga, that is Her wish and She is very happy that this has happened. Sahajayoga has to be spread in that fashion. I want to take a few minutes of your time to say a few things also which are very important to Her point of view. You know for 35 years She has travelled around the world carrying the message of Sahajayoga of Love for humanity, and today there is Sahajayoga in more then 80 countries of the world and all 5 continents, that is what She has been doing. Clapping... Now it is not my intention to take lot of your time but look at the world, you will find there is trouble, there is violence. There is one message which can save the world, and the message is Her message, Her message of Love in Sahajayoga. You are here a witness to that! She has travelled by plane, She has travelled by helicopter, She has travelled by car, by bus and if you please by bullock-cart in India and of course on foot .clapping. Can you find a gathering like this here anywhere else in the World? No, because you are bound by love together, and what She says is, yes, there is a World Council, they have to advance Sahajayoga, but there is a message to you also: Each one of you should regard yourselves as Her Messenger for spreading that Of Her 35 years She did that, then 2 years ago She decided, that it was time for Her to sit back and pass responsibility mostly to Her children to spread further the message of Sahaja Yoga. You know, the world, if you look TV news, the world is in trouble, but there is one message,

 Issue: 9 & 10 - 2006 The Divine Cool Breeze message. You know if one of you can convey a message to another one, one to two and two to four, in a few years time the world will be full of Sahajayoga, and believe me, that nothing the world needs more today than this particular thing, earth, but spread this heaven, convey your message, save the world and you can do it! So, may I promise on your behalf that you will do it?" ABig Yes from the gathering of Yogis. So, standing before Her on Her behalf, I convey you this message to you. Clappings..

 Twenty Five Years of Sahaja Yoga in Australia - A Reflexion (You have given us more than we could ask for ..) airport, Shri Mataji would sit down talk to us. Suddenly and spontaneously, the airport lounge would be transformed into heaven-on-earth, with the queen of both enthroned before Her devoted subjects, sitting quietly on the ground around Her. Some airport employees, drawn perhaps by curiosity more probably by vibrations - would hover close by in a bemused state. Many were given their Realization personally by our Mother. As She talked and laughed with us-even on occasion naming our children- the ordinary world seemed to fade and instead we were all enveloped in a light- filled bubble of timelessness. (About which Rabi Ghosh, pouring out his heart,says: "Since.long... or should we say like. We are yet to come across such a beautiful expression that pulls a string in our heart that creates a ripple of music that takes us from Mooladhar to Sahasrara. Thanks you so much that takes us into meditation. We live in collectivity and we thrive in collectivity as Shri Mataji Herself resides in Collectivity. Such a beautiful day to start with. (Here is a small information from Richard Payment (Editor DCB) coming via Toni (a very dear brother from Austria)... Farewelling our Mother at the Syndney airport on April 14th, after the blessing of three months in Australia, was as special and moving experience: the table laden with beautiful bouquets; the huge chocolate Easter eggs; the room crowded with two hundred or more How many times over the last two and half decades-since that first visit in March 1981 - have we yogis travelled to the airport with excitement and anticipation in our hearts? In the first decade the yogis-a small group of about forty-would gather near the exit doors with heart-filled expectation for that initial glimpse, that comforting glance, the divine darshan of their most compassionate Mother. How graciously She moved along the line of eager yogis, accepting each and every offering of flowers with bright greetings of"Hello, how are you?" yogis; our brother Chris' words of gratitude which spoke for us all; the songs of joy; Sir CP's sweetest and kindest words that made tears well up in our eyes from overfilled hearts. One can only take a deep breath to absorb such abundance. Yet, much has changed for our collective in over two and a half-decades. With Her encouraging smile, She dissolved all our fears and diffidence. We felt truly there were no obstacles. All that was mere illusion, like clouds becoming more and more wispy and then disappearing to reveal a clear blue sky. The first visible change is the new generation of yogis, the yuva, those bom-realized children of the 1980s and '90s who now approach adulthood. They have been growing up within our Mother's bandhan and belong so much more to Her than to us, their temporary guardians. In the impersonal and public domain of the

We may still wish at times for the words, the smiles, the acknowledgement. Yet, in Her silence, She now speaks more directly to our spirits. No longer can we glide along all the streams and tributaries, it is the strong river of eternal life in which Before us on the dais sat Shri Mataji, so much more to us now that a great queenly Mother at whose Feet we were once supplicants. She has indeed "given us more than we could ask for." Increasingly, now She is becoming the witness of Her own creation. As She recedes from interaction with us on an we now must flow.

 Balmoral Country Property buildings. Structural extension like the new rear deck and bathroom renovations, as well as new gardens and the Burwood-like re-furnishings and decorations, have created a perfect and holy sanctuary for Her in the country. The diligent and attentive preparations have in themselves been a puja and those involved with this type of creativity will confirm that they too feel they have become divine instruments in the doing. People are again saying for certain that the best work you can be involved in, is the preparation for her coming, and that in so doing we too are being transformed. Jai Shri Mataji! Over the last two years the Balmoral Country Property has been evolving from a rough old farm into a venue worthy of Puja to the Goddess. Firstly, completely new additions to the farmhouse were built to house Her in both Subtle and Physical forms. Secondly, over time, the grounds were transformed into parklands and gardens featuring alarge meditation building and grassed areas and facilities for collective gatherings. Finally, over the Shivaratri Puja weekend, the country property has been completely prepared, equipped and fully utilised for the largest gathering for Sahaja Yogis that Australia has seen in more than ten years. The Homebush Story When it became apparent that our Divine Mother would be more comfortable being at Her home in Burwood for the Shivratri Puja, the best possible configurations were designed to help everyone feel part of this great event. The trick would be to arrange everything so everyone could see the actual Puja ceremony, as well as arange for the swift transfer from the satellite venue of all the children above three Almost 1300 yogis from Australia, New Zealand and abroad gathered for two unforgettable nights of music and joy prior to the Puja in Sydney. The first on Friday evening was a spontaneous and growing bhajan session that began with focussed joy and escalated and expanded through several stages into a collective state of blissful union. Such events prove that you are truly a part and parcel of One Body and that your Mother is ever present within you and Her great Sahaja family. The second evening also ran into the very small hours and featured a truly awesome showcase of extremely good and varied performances of music and dance. When technical skills are married to puja strength devotion and collective attention the results are truly inspiring. Great young souls are fast approaching international standards and no doubt will prove beautiful instrument for awakening the World to Her incarnation. years into Burwood for the first of the three Pujas that build the complete Shivratri ceremony, At Homebush, site of the 2000 Olympic Games, not far from Burwood, a large amphitheatre was turmed into our largest most collective venue for the Puja. Featuring perfect viewing arrangements from every seat, with three colossal video screens and two huge portraits of our Divine Mother as Shri Shiva, the stage was set. Before the puja itself could be web-cast and transferred to the big screens however the vibrations began to build and The crowning beauty of the Balmoral country property is the now fully transformed farm house

As if to join in and confirm the auspiciousness of these golden moments the heavens opened and a watershed of thunder, lightning and torrential rain washed clean the suburbs of Sydney and brought much valued nourishment to this recently drought ravaged part of the World. Lord Shiva seemed to be dancing in waves of ecstasy on top of Sydney, using the very elements as His drum in a shower of blessings. US.

So here it is. cleansing for us. By the end of the first week I was beginning to feel my vibrations stronger. Heat was very much dispelled from our subtle systems. I felt great, alert perhaps for the first time in my hte. You learm how much you've been ignoring your problems. Tums out we had Right side problems. Cancer is caused by excessive I We went to the "Sahaja Yoga International Health and Research Centre", which is a mouthful, so its otherwise known as "Vashi" to the Yogis. It is about an hour out of Bombay. It is an amazing place, as is most of what happens to you in Sahaja Yoga. The blessings flow like a waterfall when you're in the attention of the Divine, I see it everyday. It is really a mirror, where you expressly go to look into yourself and see what's wrong, poke about in the tough t heat in the chakras. But in that place its cleared up in the space of a few days. Then the real work begins. I leam how valuable the Attention is, how much clouded over mine had become. I learn the true power of Attention, keeping ones attention always at the Divine feet. I cleanse my pure Desire for my spiritual ascent. This speed along my treatments. My wife is an epiphany sort of girl, things come to her in revelations. She has many insights and many gifts. My insights coms like drips, and all of a sudden IrealizeI have a full reservoir now, things have changed and here is all that I've learned. They creep up on me. Yet you're pretty much doing the same thing over and over and over again, but it really didn't feel like that, even though mentally I had the thought. areas. A typical day is waking at 5 am. Meditating (involves various Sahaj treatments, but it is an intense session.) Collective meditation starts at 8.15 am. Breakfast at 9.15. Collective footsoak 10am (very powerful treatment). Treatment by your doctor from 1lam to 1.30pm (you go to the treatment room and wait your tum, and your doctor works on your catches and irons them out). Lunch and siesta 1.30 to 4.30pm. Another treatment by our doctor (afterwards or before you do your "homework" which is prescribed for your specific problems in your subtle system) Dinner at 7.30 pm 8.30 to 10pm is Collective meditation where we listen to one of Shri Mataji's numerous talks to the Yogis, and afterwards sign bhajans with joy and gratefulness. I guess this is the topmost superficial description of my time there. Layer 3. Sahaja Yoga is so much beyond thought. I'm not sure if non Sahaja Yogis can understand this. But it can be experienced. The scope of your "vision" is so much opened out there. When you leave all at the Divine Lotus feet of God, then God takes over and works out ALL the details of your life. You need Layer 2. The first few days were an intense money, it just so happens you get it. You need

You need a job, you get it, somehow in the most inexplicable way. The miracles flow. And all this happens because you surrender to the will of God, in a very real sense. This is the goal, to totally surrender to the will of God, if you do that its all easy peezy. one meditation how beautiful it is to be one with God. "Mother you are the Doer, and the Enjoyer, I do nothing." Such a profound thing when that sinks into your being. Dissolve into the body of God, the Love flows through you, you enlighten the world. The Joy passes through you, you touch the iives of all around you. You are full of vibrations, which are Love. Your task is to give that to other people. At Vashi, you see the very outlines of God's incarnations, and see how they all relate to the current incarnation, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. You feel on your body and in your attention that Shri Mataji is the desire of God, as such she is the incarnation of the supreme Goddess, and The ego is not in Reality. if you say "I created this artwork" then you are separating yourself from God, and the artwork is a dead thing, devoid of vibrations, the Love of God, You are in Truth when you create an artwork saying "God created this artwork, and I was the brush that He used, I was the instrument, and the uniqueness of my spirit shaped it", and the vibrations flow from the art. She created the whole of creation. All of the deities were created by Her, and they are in her. Iknew this before I left, but there it is shown to you in countless meditations. Aren't we blessed to have the Goddess, who has incarnated many many many times, but this time with Her full powers as the Adi Shakti, aren't we blessed to have Her as our Guru!

He was very aware, Today we are celebrating here in this holy land the birthday of Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna is the ultimate of the fatherhood, that I described to very very aware, absolutely aware of His powers, without any ego. He had a special you before, who came on this Earth and illustrated the ultimate of that. So on this Earth, the highest fatherhood is Shri Krishna's awareness. But in the kingdom of God, we can say in Heavens, or even above everything else, resides Sadashiva who does not take called "Samhara shakti" by which He power could destroy all those people who tried to harm the divine manifestation. This "Samhara shakti" is expressed as the Chakra (Sudarshan) in His hand. And another is the "Gada" (Mace) in His hand. These two incarnations. He is one of the aspects, Shri Krishna is one of the aspects ofthis Adi Shakti who came on this Earth as Radha. She is the powers were within Him, and He acted according to the power of Radha, because She is the one who sustained, the power of Shri Krishna. The proof of that is this that when He was in Gokul with Radha He did all His "Samhara' work. And afterwards He just became a chariot driver for Arjuna. So for His disciple Arjun. He became evenachariot driver. same who came as the Mother of Christ, and She gave the name of Christ as Khrist the surname of Shri Krishna, as if it is Krishna's name, from Krishna. He's called as "Krisht" in Indian languages, Krisht. And I have told you before why He was called as Yeshu or Jesu. So today we are going to see the two aspects of Shri Krishna, which were the manifestation of His divine birth. The another great quality of Yogeshwara was complete discetion power built in. So He knew who was a devil and who was not, who is good, who is bad, who is posessed, who is not posessed, who is innocent, who is not. This was built in within Him, this power of complete discrimination. In Rama's life they showed a man; man, a Purushottama, the best of the father in worldly affairs. And in Shri Krishna's life they showed him the highest fatherhood as in Yogeshwara or in divine work. So the first aspect of Shri Krishna we have to understand is the Yogeshwara and the second aspect of his as the Virata. And He had a capacity more expressing His witnesshood, asa 'Sakshi'. He had the capacity. I mean He was a Sakshi Himself-I should say this way is easier to understand. He was a Sakshi, He had the capacity of witnessing the whole world as a play. At the time of Rama, Rama was one who got involved into His problems, to show as if He is a full human being, Yogeshwara means the Lord of the Yoga, or the Power of Yoga. He is called because He reached the optimum that one has to reach as a Yogi. As if He is the ideal you have to reach. Now as a Yogi, He was born of a royal family but he lived in the jungles, in the forest, with cows, with ordinary people. He used to sleep

 17 The Divine Cool Breeze Issue: 9 & 10 - 2006 not hear. It has no effect on Him, no retention on Him, no action on Him. Whatever He is, He is complete: sixteen petals is complete moon, sixteenth day of the moon is the Pumima. That is how one has to be, complete in oneself, complete confidence in oneself. But confidence should not be confused with ego. But confidence is complete wisdom, it's complete dharma, it is complete love, complete beauty, and is complete God. That's what it should be. so that human beings should not say that He was God, so how could we accept God because 'He was God after all? Now this capacity in Him to witness has to be seen in every yogi. The element he controls is ether. We call it "Akasha" in Sanskrit. This ether now as you know, we are using for our television, for our radio, for every sort of a collective work. So we have to be incharge of the ether element as yogis. And that is the subtlest of all, in the sense that you permeate everything with that, and is above all, like plastic, also permeate into everything into matter, into everything up to the air. But it cannot enter into ether. So the negativity cannot enter into ether. So when you enter into your ethereal zone, you actually enter into the area which is thoughless awareness. And the sustenance of that is done by Christ, by the Spirit. So you can realize now as a yogi, your state of mind should be ethereal. Now when He said that "You give up all your dharmas and surrender to Me" in Gita, what He was meaning is that all other things about which you are worried "You give up and become one with me, so I look after you". Give up the responsibility to Shri Krishna, so the complete integrated Divinity will start expressing through you. Means If you say that you have to be responsible, then He says alright, go ahead try! But if you say that "You are responsible, I'm justan institution or an instrument in Your hand" then you start manifesting it well. And that is how your Vishuddhi chakra gets opened up. And what should be the state of your super- ego? This is the ego part of it, that you should be in ethereal state. And as a super-ego you should see it as a play, you should see the play but This is some part of the Yogeshwara I have spoken to you. But as He is the brain within us, He becomes the brain within us. We have to of the negativity. Negativity will run away, don't get involved into it, don't play into their hands. The negativity will separate from you. know all the qualities of a divine brain are within. So whatever wve do with out brain like intrigue, the deception, all which are bad things by your brain as they call it, are done by Him for the divine purpose without getting any blemish upon himself. And the other side of it, so called positive, like politics, like diplomacy, or like leadership, all that is His own doing, like even the thinking of the future and all that, He does planning, thinking, all those things, administration. As a play, everything is done as So the ego and the super-ego both rise from the Vishuddhi chakra. They can be receded by the Agnya chakra but have to be sucked into the Vishuddhi. The greatest quality of Yogeshwara is that He is not at all involved into it, detached, abosolutely. If He eats His food, He does not eat it. If He speaks, He does not speak. If He sees, He does not see. If He hears, He does

 Issue: 9 & 10- 2006 18 The Divine Cool Breeze of taking out their teeth better put them back into their throats. And if you can do that, then there is no problem as far as their effect on us is concerned, because you are more powerful and more tricky. a play, because He's the Master, as we call, a "Sutradhara", the one who plays with the strings with the pantomimes. Now the other things that we have to understand Shri Krishna at this stage of Sajaha Yoga, that it is the Virata Shakti that is manifesting at this time and not the Shri Krishna Shakti which was at His time. And the power that is working here is not more that of Radha or of Mary, but of Viratangana. That's why the knowledge of Sahaja Yogis is much wider than the knowledge of all the saints of ages. But it is not deeper than them. If you can deepen your knowledge, this wider knowledge will have proper roots within you. So the brain are the roots, here are the roots of the whole tree oflife. Actually Kundalini comes up and waters the brain first, so that the whole tree of life is drenched in the Divine Bliss and Divine Knowledge. Beacuse the Virata Shakti has now taken that form, like the tree when it is grown, it grows upward. But when it is laden with fruit, it comes down. First it is attractive by its flowers, by its timber, by the other parts of its body. And people try to destroy it for it. But when the fruit appear, they want to preserve it, and the tree bends down, with humility, is very valuable. So you are the fruits. That Viratangana Shakti, you are the fruits. Because you are so valuable that those people who wanted to ruin or to destroy the Divine power from this Earth will start thinking that they have to gain something out of these fruits. So today the Virata Shakti has given you á great value, because people see that by having one Sahaja Yogi with them it is so precious. Say one ordinary man gets his Realization, then he develops his value. In that his own value he can be respected, loved, and he can be given the highest if he's a proper Sahaja Yogi. So this Virata Shakti that we have to work out, gives us the sense of collective consciousness first. First we understand it through our brain power. But the whole brain power is to be guided by the Heart, is to be watered; but in Sanskrit is a very beautiful word "Sinchan" like dew drops, spray, with the Love of God. So the integration of this brain has to take place with Heart and with your liver. Then only the Virata-Shakti takes another form. The weapons of killing become the weapons of forgiveness. Every sort of destructive power is used for the construction, as if it is tricked. So you should understand today what Virata Shakti is 'We are going to worship that Virata Shakti which has given fruits". As a result of that, ali these different churches, fanaticism, and atheism and communism and all that-ism, all these will neutralize because they will see their benefit in it. But you have to become that. That is the biggest thing one has to know is to bend down towards the Mother Earth, to be humble. Absolutely the humility inside is really going to Like nowItold thematrick, how to trick these gurus. The power that they have can be tricked against them, as is said that their teeth must be put into their necks, into their throats. Instead

 The Divine Cool Breeze Issue: 9 & 10 - 2006 19 give you the complete value of Sahaja Yoga fruits. questions to Mother, bringing personal problems, stupid ideas, negativity, all those people are still not yet the fruits. Those Sahaja Yogis who boast about themselves are like the fruit which are But the matured people are those who surrender, who bow to the Mother Earth. So the capacity to bow is the best judgement of yourself. And leaving everything to the power of gravity of your Mother to do every work for you. And leaving all your small little worries behind, you have to rise above these distracting powers and achieve the completion of this Virata Shakti which ultimately becomes a "Madhurya Shakti". "Madhurya", there is no word in English language but it means a "sweet power". Like the fruit becomes sweet. That's how you all have everything very sweet in the sense it was all a Madhurya Shakti that was acting, all His play, all His dancing. All His stories if you read, is nothing but Madhurya Shakti, towards Gopas and Gopis, towards other Sahaja Yogis. getting ruined only on the tree. The only fruits that bend down are accepted as good and matured fruits, and not those who assert that they are the highest. But some of the negative people should not by any chance take advantage of this and say that they are good because they are bending down. It's not the logic. Some of them pose they are humble; even a rotten fruit bends down. But the mature fruit shows its humility by its weight. That is the guru tattwa weight. So from the Viratangana power you get the power of maturity up to the fruit and then we become blessed by Guru Principle. Those who are still involved in getting to better sunshine or getting to better water supply of all these things, are not yet matured, because the fruit doesn't need anything from the Mother Earth, nor from the elements. But it surrenders, bends, it bows to the Mother Earth. So you have to keep your Mother pleased by pleasing other Sahaja yogis, and not other people. They are not important. So today we are going to shorten the Puja, and that's why it took so much time upstairs, fo shorten it! So the time lost is time gained for ever and ever. So the Sahaja Yogi who goes on asking May God Bless You.

 VISHUDDHI CHAKRA Puja Parvachan of H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Vienna -4.9.1983 that is what He has said that "surrender your ego to Me", so that when you say a mantra or utter words, they are effective as weapons, good weapons, effective good weapons, efficient. Before going to America, I wanted to speak more about the Vishuddhi chakra and about Shri Krishna's aspect within us. In the first puje Geneva, I spoke quite a lot about it, but there is no end to it, of course, because it is the centre of Virata. But one has to realize that the message of Shri Krishna was to surrender. Now the surrendering that we think in the gross way is like an enemy surrenders to another enemy. when the word "surrender" is spoken, we build up our barriers by thinking that we have to surrender something to the other part. But when Shri Krishna was talking about surrender, He was saying that "surrender your enemies to me so that I will get rid of them". Now when we talk, let us see how I see your ego expressed in your talk, so that you will So understand how to address Me and to judge yourself. For example shaking your necks too much is a sign of a Mr. Ego shaking head for nothing at all. Like many people have a habit "yes" if it is said, they'll go on like this for ten times. There is not need. Actually, you should move only once, with humility, the head "yes Mother" it is all right. You must move your neck with respect and with understanding that Shri Krishna is sitting there. With dignity. But we forget it all the time and we start using it to assert ourselves when we talk to someone. And we shake too much or we push it in such a way that another person is sort-of dominated by it. Now the worst enemy that we have is our ego. And with ego starts all kinds of other problems, because it is the biggest barrier for our growth. And the ego starts as you know from the Vishuddhi chakra, and can be sucked into Vishuddhi chakra. Now there is another method when you talk to Me, like saying "no Mother". Itis very common, ifI say anything, the first reaction of people could be "no Mother". After all you see there is a course going on, even when I'm speaking it isa mantra, when I'm not speaking, is a mantra flowing. And suddenly you come out with your "no Mother", you create a ripple back in the whole thing. Now at that time, ifyou just listen to Me what I'm saying, the saying itself will work it out, you don't have to do anything. Now another way is the style in which you talk to Me, also I can see the right Vishuddhi acting. It is when we talk normally to each other, if we Now let us see how is Vishuddhi chakra made. All the vowels that we use cone from Vishuddhi chakra. And like in Devanagri language it is a...ang-aha. So as you know you cannot compile a word without a vowel, it is so important. A consonant is weak, without any strength, without the vowel. So the strength of a person comes through the Vishuddhi chakra in his speech. But it can be absolutely stiff also, the strength could be absolutely stiff. Supposing you have a very strong weapon but you can't lift it, so what is the use of having a weapon like that? See, this Mr. Ego tries to make the weapon heavy and stiff like jammed machine-guns. Now

 Issue: 9 & 10 - 2006 21 The Divine Cool Breeze many types which are artificial things absolutely. Before God, what is your property? What is your money? What is your position? What is your family? What is your education? You see, these things have no value in the presence of God. The possessions that one value so much have no value. So one has to realize that if we are the possessions of God, we should be proud of one thing only, that His vibrations flow through us. That is: He is proud of us. have to say "yes", we'll say "m-m". That is very common here "a-a". This style, they say "hum- um" and then on top of that to say "mm-mm" as if you see it clearly. It is: you are not receiving anything in it, but you are trying to sort of put it to an equal pressure on the flow. The humility is the best way of conquering this ego of Vishuddhi. And when talking to others, try to develop sweet methods, sweet ways unhurting other people. And you will be surprised that Vishuddhi will immediately start behaving in such a sweet manner, because the bhoots don't like sweetness, they are quarrelsome, they are harsh, they are always trying to say something to hurt. Like supposing you give Mea fruit or a Ganesha, or anything, it gets very much valued because I have touched it and the vibrations are there. Like this Ganesha now for example, if you see the value is zero as far as the metal is concerned, but when made into an art-piece has some much more value. In this world, the value increases with art, but in the realm of God, or in the spiritual world or Divine world, the value of a Ganesha, the same Ganesha will be a thousand times more than what it is just now as just an art piece. So that is now what is given to you, a very high value. So the pride and the vanity of artificiality, artificial things, is all man-made, mythical, and should be surrendered because it is a myth. So this Vishuddhi on the right hand side is to be controlled by surrendering as it is said. Actually you surrenderyour ego to begin with. And this ego when you surrender, it has to be done from your heart, it should not be a lip-service. From your heart: "I don't want this ego any more. I want Reality." "Let the Reality be seen by me, felt by me, enjoyed by me." And once you start doing it from your heart, you will be amazed that your voice will become sweet. Apart from that, it will have the Divine Power flowing through it. That is what we say that you have now "wak shakti", means the power of speach. Then the human mind has another capacity to be jealous, to be jealous of others. This also comes from unwise understanding. If you surrender your jealousies at the Lotus Feet of God, Imean, you are doing all rubbish actually. The stupid jealousies that you have are as you know, of no value, neither in this world, nor in that world. The most surprising thing is that the Sahaja Yogis feel jealous of each other! And I still can't understand how can it be? If you are standing in the sunshine, then you all are jealous So when you surrender ego, what you do actually is to say that "I'm not doing anything, it is You who do everything". So that a little drop has now become an ocean. And so your sound has got the power of the ocean. Now the second thing you have to surrender, is the pride, or vanity. Now the vanity can be of

Somebody's shadows are big, somebody's shadows are small, so you are material greed and also human greed, like jealous of each other? Sometimes I give a present to one person, can't give to others, then possessing this, possessing Mataji also. This they get jealous! I only give more time also must be surrendered. And this could be sometimes to people who really are getting lost! Another enemy we have is greed. I mean possessing your wife, possessing your children, very dangerous in Sahaja Yoga also. This is myo onovar carpet, this is my camera, this is my So one has to understand that all our ideas about taperecorder. Once you start understandingT jealousies are stupid. And I can't understand those who are not realized, they are jealous of that's the truth. Sahaja Yogis, and they try to make them fall! Instead of being jealous, they should become like Sahaja Yogis! In Sahaja Yoga also I've seen some very funny things happening, an incidence Like a person came to me and was very angry that "Mother You spent so much time with a conscious of all these things. particular person, and I'm very jealous. And You said I have to be like the people about whom So the greed. Also the lust of other women and I'm jealous so I would like to know how to be indulging into lust too much. Giving too muchos like the person who was with your for such a importance to the agencies of lust. That creates o time?" So I said "That fellow is really a lunatie! great problem, not only for Sahaja-Yogis, but You want to become a lunatic? Have you no discretion?" ASahaja Yogi must have discretion if his Vishuddhi is alright. You should understand that what I'm saying is to be used discreetly, not blindly. So you can those, who are supposed to be brought up iniob understand without discretion, whatever I say,i how funnily you can use it so deterimental to your growth.sbenm i bain what is mine is not the Truth, nothing is mine, plage Also some people I know of, they say that "my e job, or my business, or my enterprise".

 Guru Puja 28 July, 1996 (Pravachan of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi) That may be the reason they were not so much concerned. All the time they were testing their deciples. Even Ramdas, the Guru of Shivaji was testing even Shivaji for so many times, though he was a born realized. So to get this Guru pad, this position of a guru, after that they had to work very-very hard to achieve a state of a saint. But in Sahaja Yoga that is not the case as you know. I just thought if people get their realisation they will see forthemselves what is wrong in them. They will introspect themselves and will try to correct themselves. It is true for many-many people but some of them still are lingering behind and are going on and on and on and thinking that they are Sahaja Yogis they have achieved a lot, they are something very special. So this delusion is all the time is creating this problem. This delusion makes them very narrow minded, selfish, self- centered and people cannot believe how can they be Sahaja Yogis! Today we have gathered here to do Guru Puja. The system started long time back in India, I think, even at the time of Patanjali, may be even earlier when there were great seekers and their gurus were sitting in the jungles where they used to get permission to go there and then they would get their realisation, very few of them, one or two. So we had many rishis and munis in the olden times in India. So the system of guru started. Also one of the reasons is that there is no organized religion in India. There is no Pope, there is no priest, nothing like that. There are priests for just worshiping in the temples. But for giving realisation, for talking about higher life, they all had to go to very great realized souls. And it was absolutely the freedom of the Guru whom to accept, whom not to accept. Everybody was tested thoroughly by the Guru, ifthey are capable of achieving Self Realisation or not. And this test was so hard, so difficult and also to a point ofcruelty that very few could pass through that test. It is not like the Sahaja Yoga that everybody is a Sahaja yogi, it is not like that. That of course made it a very narrow So the first and foremost thing we have to know is that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out because Param Chaitnya is transmitting compassion. It never did before, never had that kind of an attitude whichit is there becauseIama Mother. And this compassion has worked in this way that you all have got your realisation, you have achieved a state which you can call as Self Realized Souls. But still, because you got it so easily, cheaply, I think, still we don't realize what we have got, still we don't practice meditation, introspection and dedication. Some are very much there, but mostly we are just living in the idea that we have already achieved. So the first margin for people to achieve their realisation and these Gurus never used to leave their own seats, they call it Takia. They would be there in their own place. All those who would like to go to him would come, ifhe allowed then only they can meet him. You may have gone for miles together, nothing, no obligation of the Gurus that he should meet you. Perhaps they did not feel that love and compassion for the seekers. They did not understand that the seekers are ardently seeking the truth and they should not suffer.

 Issue: 9 & 10 - 2006 25 The Divine Cool Breeze yogi it is very important that he should be able to live like a saint not necessarily that you should become a Sanyasi but from inside your body should be such that you can dominate your body. How can you not sleep anywhere? Why cannot you sleep anywhere? Then also that they want to have a very comfortable arrangements about bathrooms, this that. All these ideas are there because you are very self-conscious but super-consciousness is not there. You want to have every thing first class and anybody who tries to interfere with that kind of a things you don't like it. I can understand a person who is very old, who cannot manage things, he has to have a certain amount of body comforts but even young people these days are extremely comfort oriented. That is not for Sahaja Yogis. thing we should introspect, are we concerned about ourselves? All the time do we think that we are suffering, we have this problem that problem or this should be done that should be done. If the attention is on that all the time you are worried about yourselves then you cannot break, you cannot breakthrough this shell of your Being which is under the domination of your mental selfishness of self- centeredness. Even self-centeredness is absolutely against your growth. There are many-many people who come, I have seen, even to Cabella, I know they have to suffer a lot because they think it is very open space where they have to live and they must make all arrangements to make themselves comfortable. Such people have to grow still much more. For a saint any place has to be heavenly. You must have seen me enjoying everything, I can live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere. I have no demands of any kind, but if you are worried about your body comforts, your body troubles, still you are at a body level, which you have to transcend. Worried about how you look, how you dress up, what sort of things you have to wear, all this makes you yet not a good Sahaj | Yogi. This is one style of Sahaja Yogis who still want very great comforts. So what you have to do, if you are used to comforts try to go and sleep on the street. I will not do that, but you can do or sleep on a tree. You may fall down doesn't matter. Do all kinds of things that are necessary to punish your body to understand that you are not bound to this comfort of the body. This is one of the greatest thing that one has to see that you are not bound by your body. It's alright if you have comfort well and good, if you don't have well and good. For a Sahaja Of course, I have seen people in the West are better off in this matter, because when they go to India they told me they like ST buses better than comfortable buses. So I said 'why"? Because Mother you can jump in the bus with all the luggage, because the windows are open, you can breathe very natural, very good. They wanted to go on bullock-carts also. I mean they enjoy all that. Actually if you see, you notice in the Western world mostly people are taking to more rustic life. They are enjoying more the rustic style of life than to this socalled comfortable artificial life. Not so much Indians, I would say, also Malaysians. I think most of the people I have met in the Western countries are really great because they can sleep anywhere, they can eat anything. You ask them how did you like the food? 'What did we eat I don't know Mother'. That is the sign. That is the sign of the person who is not bothered as to

 26 Issue: 9 & 10-2006 The Divine Cool Breeze nothing is needed. Joy itself is joy. You are enjoying only joy, nothing is needed to make you happy. You are happy because of joy that you have in the Nirananda State. If you go and see how these saints lived, you will be amazed! How they manage their lives, you will be very much amazed! How many days they used to fast without food, never bothered about it. They never thought it was fasting, they just used to think we have not food so no food. Of course what he is eating, what he is getting, what is his taste. I like this, I like that, these words drop up. It is not difficult. It is not difficult. You might think that I am asking you to do something hazardous, you see. It is not difficult at all. Because if you have to impress people around, you have to be like a saint. And if you are a fussy person, if you are fuss-pot then you cannot impress others that you have got Self- Realisation. don't have to go through that, you have got you your Realisation. So now you have the power to achieve this mastery, now you have this Many people tell me 'Mother people had to do so much, had to go to Himalayas do this, do that and then they got their Realization. Howis it these people you have blessed? Even some great saints ask me that "what right they have to get their Realisation? Why did you give them Realisation? What have they achieved? I said, only their desire". Their desire was very much there that they should get their realisation. And that's how they got it, But now to got into only desire is not sufficient. You have to depend on your Self, in the light of your Spirit, you should see what's wrong. This is very important thing. Ask question to yourself, Why do I want this, why do I need this, what is the purpose?" Because as you have seen all the rest of the world is mad, I call it mad, because they are running after stupid things. They want things which have no meaning to spirituality. So spirituality itself should be self-satisfying. If you are spiritually endowed then you are power. The another thing I have noticed about Sahaja Yogis, some ofthem have grudges about others. Sahaja Yoga is the blessings oflove, blessings of compassion. There is not place for any kind of hatred or any kind of revenge or anger among Sahaja Yogis. If you have that, youmust conquer it. It is a good chance. If you find somebody who is very hot tempered, who is very angry type, go and make friends with that person. Just see if you can carry on with that person or not. There is fusspot also make friends with such a fuss-pot and see that you achieve that peace which will keep you above all kinds of hatred, all kinds of temper which is very bad thing. But some Sahaja Yogis loose their temper very fast. I would say they cannot be Sahaja yogis because if you have no control over your anger then how are you powerful of compassion and love? But you don't even have to control it, just there. Once you have it, that state, then you just watch it. In the olden days the saints, mostly, used to be very much angry type of people. They could not bear the stupidity of the world. self-satisfied. And this self-satisfaction within you will lead you to that ocean of joy about which I have been telling you and all the scriptures have described it. For Sahaja Yogis the word we use is "Nirananda". Nirananda means a joyous state where

 27 Issue: 9 & 10-2006. The Divine Cool Breeze care for yourself, you care for your family and care for your children, then you have not achieved much. You are only worried about yourself! because that is your limited area where you move. But if you can break that and find out places where you have to express your love, And they used to be very very angry type, and they used to run away from there. I know of a saint Nityanand Swami who always lived on the tree and if anybody tried to come near him, he used to throw stones at him. Could not bear people who were all seated out and. But you don't need that. You have a way of achieving love and affection of the people who seem to be very very troublesome and grudging type or may be some people who are very aggressive. This is not a difficult task if you try a little bit the other way round. Mostly people when they find somebody who is very hot tempered person, they run away from them. They don't want anything to do with them. Those who are not hot tempered, those who are good natured you can always be friendly with the, what is so great about that? What is so nice about it? What is you can. As they say the water finds its own level, in the same way this compassion has to flow to all the places, to all the ditches, everywhere and should find its own level. But if you are just satisfied with yourself and you are not bothered, you are just trying to believe that you are a great soul because you are a Sahaja yogi then I must say that you are sadly mistaken. In this life time you can achieve that state. In this life time you can get to that state within yourself. God's Realisation so sweet about it? But how you speak to the person, how you talk to that person, how you manage that person, your love will definitely melt him down because he is a Sahaja Yogi. I am not saying of non-Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogis as they are, you have to be extremely compassionate and affectionate and love them. Now the third thing that troubles Sahaja yogis is that 'Mother we want God's Realisation'. That makes Me laugh. You see, it is already there, already there, like once you get into the sea and you say Mother we want to go to the bottom of the sea, you can always Just slip and will be there! go. The another thing which is extremely important for us to know that we have got this Realisation through Mother's love. Only my compassion has acted. Only the power of Mother's compassion could have worked it out. Now even if this love is flowing towards the stones or towards the mountains or towards anything which is very solid, the ripples come back. They have to come back. In the same way you people In the same way once you have developed a kind of Self-Realisation and have jumped into the ocean of this compassion, there is no need to achieve anything. The sense of achievement, 'I should be that, I should be this,' is all coming from human hauntings. That should be over. Now you are Godly people. So you should not think I should achieve this state, I should achieve that now, who have got realisation, have to know that compassion and love is the only power you have got, nothing else. If you love yourself, you state. But just go on slipping. Just giving up all the weights that you have on your

 Issue: 9 & 10- 2006 28 The Divine Cool Breeze given up my house and I have given up my children.' I said, one more thing you have given up is 'your brains'. So they said but how do you that we have given up our brains?' I said 'very simple'. I have given up nothing, because Iam holding nothing. What is there to give up when you are not holding anything? Now I would say, in this house or on my body anywhere, if you think you find anything equal to the dust particle of Shri Krishna you can take it. Should be equal to. They started looking here and there. I said then what have you given up? Just stones? What have you given up? Why are you boasting about giving up that giving up this. They even shave there heads! What is it? heads and it will workout. This is what I have been saying to you that you have to dissolve yourself into the compassion. say Also there are still very few people who want to be in the front. Specially Indians will all sit together in the front. They have no right. They have no right to sit in front. Nobody has the right to sit in front or to seek a place. They should sit wherever they get seat to sit down with complete satisfaction. Whether you sit in front or in that corner in darkness, you can get my vibrations, you can get everything. So to be prominent to sit at some place, where you are prominent is not necessary. What is it in prominence, what do you get? To be lost in the crowds, to be lost into the ocean of love is the main thing. All these are mythical that we should somehow or other get the front place. You see in Marathi they say.. means I have managed to get the front seat. Front will be the back and back All these useless ideas that we have done this, we have done that. Anybody in Sahaja Yoga who thinks that he is doing a lot of work for Sahaja Yoga should give it up completely. That is a sign of another ignorance! If you are part and parcel of the ocean, everything is done by ocean, you are doing nothing. You have such ideas about yourself, shows, how little you know about yourself. You are the ocean, and if you are the ocean, how can you claim I have touched this shore, I have touched that shore? No more T is left. Once this T ness drops out then only the universal being within you shines. All these things are so clearly evident in our characters. Some people are very identified, say with their country or may be with their worshiping style, whatever it is. All these mis- identification have to be given up. It is very difficult for the people because they are so conditioned. As long as your conditioning remains, you cannot rise above your mind which is a myth. You cannot. will be the front. It is very surprising how still people are trying to achieve something so nonsensical! Where is your mind, where is your attention, what are you thinking? If you are thoughtless, you will be satisfied, you will be happy, will not ask for anything. You will not want anything. What is there to have? What is so important? All these ideas come from ignorance Imust tell you, from ignorance. Once this Hare Rama, Hare Krishna fellow came to Me and he said that we have heard that you are a great saint, this thing, that thing, and you have all the comforts of life, you have everything here, very nice, this thing that thing? So how are you a saint? I said how you are a saint? I have given up my family, I have given up my cars, I have

 Issue: 9 & 10 - 2006 29 The Divine Cool Breeze kinds of Christ I have seen andI feel that how can they emit vibrations still? While with my photograph how you can compare? Also cameras were to be developed at this time! Do you notice that point? Cameras were developed at this time, not before that. This loudspeaker was not developed before that. Aeroplanes were not developed before that! I have been travelling Nineteen days, one day in the plane and second day in the public programme. They could not do all that. Nobody can do this, neither Shri Krishna nor anyone. They could not fly by aeroplanes in those days. Now we say we are 65 countries somebody says 68 countries. They go on correcting, but is only possible because today, today there are aeroplanes. They were never there. So all these things are, even video, even the way you are seeing my image there, was that available before? No. So this is a very special time where science has also supported seekers to find. Science has done it. We have to be thankful to Now try to understand what your conditionings are. Onc of them, I would say, I have seen I was so surprised, you go to Western countries, all of them only sing songs of Shri Ganesha. They know all the songs of Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha's Photographs, Shri Ganesha's everthing, children also. NowI have seen their vibrations stopped. Why should they stop? Why should Ganesha stop the vibrations? Why they are doing it I realized because once I said that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ. Their identification is with Christ and Christianity, in a very subtle way. So all the vibrations stopped. Imagine which Shri Ganesha's music we heard in one of the Eastern Block countries and all the vibrations had stopped! They were singing all the songs, all the songs of Shri Ganesha, not one song of Sahaj Yoga! Leave alone about the Guru, not once. So even there is a very subtle identification. There was one fellow in.And they are not free you can see they are not free, because all these artists have a certain style. If it is Rambrandt, it is a style, ifit is a Leonardo, it is a style. Though they are born realized still they have a style. Nobody is like this that he will make today like this and tomorrow like that. There is no freedom. They are bound by their own style. Everybody has one style and that is the style they follow because what is the reason? Reason is that they must have done 3-4 types of styles, most have, sure. But people must have rejected, this is no good, this is no good, so it is all you see, opinion of the people. So they must have taken to one style, alright this is the style. science. A part of science which has been so much supporting. Even there was not a car, I could not have gone up to Milano. Imagine going on a bullock cart, what would have happened to me? So all these things are created today for you. You were also born in those times for this special reason. They could not give realisation because that time you were not there. Very few people of your calibers were there. I wonder if you understand your caliber! The way you are sometimes growing, shows that you don't understand your caliber. You don't know what you are. How much the whole atmosphere has worked cut? The science has duly worked out. Science is a So you can see Christ, if he is Japanese, he will have Chinky eyes, if he is Chinese, he will have no nose, if he is Indian, he will be dark. So all

It is more than satisfaction for me and sometimes Ithink there is nothing to be done now any more, finished. But then they invite me here and invite me there. Some just do it but to gift of the nature. All this has been worked out for you to achieve the highest state in the shortest time. But for that one has to be extremely introspecting. Instead of thinking of what you have to achieve, be introspecting. This introspection will help you and you will really become real Gurus. When you go to other villages, other places, other cities, people should know from your bing itself that some great person has comet You don't have to tell, don't have to certify, simplicity of your temperament itself. First time I went to Leningrad, nobody knew about me, no advertisement, nothing. Theyjust put some posters, some. There were 2000 people in the hall and 2000 outside. In the hall they had to pay. I was wondering what is the matter and when I came out I gave them I am over satisfied. Now once be very frank you have planted a tree, it is like a mango tree Once you have planted the mango tree, lookec after it for 3-4 years, then it looks after itself. I gives fruits. It doesn't need any water nothing just grows by itself. In the same way it should happen with you. You should grow by yourself Of course we will find people who are stupid, who are aggressive, who are not at all Sahaja Yogis and trying to be Sahaja Yogis. You find all kinds. So just see them, that's all. In this Guru Puja, you have to decide that what are the criteria. First a Guru has to be without realisation but I said you come tomorrow. So 2000 from inside and 2000 from outside and desires. Any desire whatsoever. Nirichh, as they say. There is one false guru in India who said that if I had the powers as mother has then I would have become King of this world. So people said 'then why don't you become? Why doesn't Mother become like that? Why doesn't She become the king? So they said because She is "Nirichh", means She has no desires. Person who has no desire will not become about 2000 more came, and almost sitting on the ground! I was amazed! I said, 'what made you to come to my programme?" They said, 'Mother so obvious, your photograph! Such sensitivity of spirituality, so obvious from your photograph'! and there were Scientists, there were doctors and all kinds of intelligent people but they could feel the spirituality from the face! That kind of sensitivity we should have. anything. So I said go and tell him, if you have desires, you cannot have powers also. It is only because She has no desire, that is why all these powers are there. So any desire that comes into your mind you should say, I do not want to get it. Just forget it. When desire is over-powering you, just divert your attention. Any kind of stupid desire can take charge and how you become desireless is by getting to the Thoughtless Awareness. Any crisis comes Then you don't need any discretion. Nothing, you know, this is this, this is this, this is this. Don't have to judge, don't have to think. You cannot say, 'who will be best fitted for this'. Those who have come for first time, those who have come later on, or those who will be coming, younger or older, women, men or children. It is there. In my life time if I see so many of you, so much transformed, looking so

 Issue: 9 & 10-2006 31 The Divine Cool Breeze anything just for seeing's sake. You must react. This is not good that is not good. IfI say it is 5 o'clock, you say it is 5 past 2 minutes 3 seconds. This comes with terrible conditioning which has to go, 'not to react'. Why should you react? Then the argument starts, then fight starts and then words come. If you tell your mind, 'nothing doing, you are myth and I am not going to react to anything,'99.9% problem will be solved in, you should be able to rise into that state of Thoughtless Awareness. Just to be peaceful. Look at your desires with peace and tell the desire 'Oh I am very much satisfied, now don't come. I don't want you. That's how you can become desireless. There is this compassion and the compassion that becomes actually the power. Small-small things, you can express your love, very small- small things and in a very sweet ways you can Then the last but not the least is the Ego.I cannot understand a saint having Ego! Just cannot understand. It is so stupid to have ego. It is a kind of a domination. If slightest things are wrong you get angry. If somebody says something, you get angry! That means your power of love and compassion is still not full. You can of course correct people when they have to be corrected but for that you should have this power within yourself. The person should know that you are correcting that person because you love that person, not for selfishness, not for any gain. But this ego is a very big problem and that comes up by, I should say, ego makes you very arrogant, horrible. But if you are humble, really not just to have the humility ofa businessman but ifyou are humble from within yourself, from your heart, enjoying your humility, then this ego can run away. You have to ask yourself now what I am angry for? Again I come back to the same point, 'introspection', because you are not here just to carry on some jobs but you are here to become saints. Then this ego should be made into a great instrument of Love and joy. You can, it is not difficult. This one is what is ego is reactions to things'. You can react to things in a sweet way and you can react to things in a deadly manner. express your love. This is very important that the whole world today needs love and peace and we have to give peace and love to everyone that is possible. Of course Sahaja Yogis is very easy, but even non-Sahaja yogis, we must treat them with respect and love. But you should not have a desire that you should get back anything from them. It is whatever done is over. You have known so many Sahaja Yogis who came to Sahaja Yoga and gained so much and have betrayed us. Doesn't matter. Not important because they are going to be losers not Me. So there is nothing to bother about these things. The another thing is, try to see that your mind does not react. Some people have a habit, or I think most ofthem have, to react. You tell them something, they will put their own one tail in it! Never will they accept if somebody says something. If you are reacting what will go into your heads, what will go into your heart, what will go into your attention? So the reaction itself isa signof proper development in yourself. This attention which is trying to go into all the areas of your mind and body and everywhere is not there. It cannot enter because as soon as it tries to enter you shut it by reacting. You cannot see

 32 Issue: 9 & 10 - 2006 The Divine Cool Breeze to be given only on Guru Puja, specially the saris that have been given to me are all to be given during Guru Puja but I am sorry I cannot give anything to the leaders or to anyone on this day. I hope you people don't mind. Then the humour comes in. Also you speak as if there are fragnant flowers which are coming out. Then every action of yours everything becomes very gentle and sweet. Have this ego that will be gentle, will be fine, will be sweet, will be forgiving, will be loving. Let's have this ego. Start with this kind of ego. The other way round, we will be surprised, how you can really conquer the whole world! To be the Guru and to be a mother is a very difficult thing. Because if you see the Gurus have been very strict disciplinarians. They always try to discipline the disciples and be quite hard with them. But the Mother cannot be that hard. It is the trouble with the Mother Guru. That may be one of the reasons that people take sometimes Sahaja yoga for granted. You should not, because you have got your realisation, now you are realized souls, you are masters. So you should look after your ascent. I don't have to tell you what is to be done, because you have the light in your hand and you can do that very well. I hope today's lecture you liked very much and you don't mind ifI have said something that might have upset you a little bit. But still one has to see because you all have to grow inside and outside and we have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere. So we should see everyone whether it is woman or a man you should see how many people you have given realisation to. It is very important that you start giving realisation all over the world. In this fashion it will spread and I don't have to, then, travel so much as nowadays I am travelling still. I think you all should take it up upon yourselves that you will do at least travelling around your cities, around your places of work. You can start talking about Sahaja Yoga openly. All the blessings are there, all the powers are there. You can work it out. Anybody who finds any diffficulty can give bandhan and can manage the On this day of Guru Puja, this Guru is supposed to tell something to his disciples about correcting themselves. In my own sweet way I have said to you which you should not mind. I don't mean to condemn you by any chance but to give you a proper sense of introspection, proper sense of introspection by which you will get your GURU PAD. My only, I should not say desire, because I don't have desire, so my only vision is that I should see all the Sahaja Yogis drenched in the power of love, enjoying each others love, enjoying each others relationship and improving relationships. I know there are problematic people, I know they are problematic, but if you cannot solve the problem what is the use of your becoming masters? SoI leave it to you to solve your own problems which all you are facing and introspection with love and compassion, not by condemning yourselves. I am sure, you can manage it. My God Bless You Now, you see every puja, I give presents to all the countries for hosting to all the ladies, all the men, the leaders. Only in Guru Puja l am sorry, I am not supposed to give any presents to anyone. It is the Guru only has to grab everything from you. (Laughter..). All this has

 Sahaja Yoga and Nursery Rhymes has, among other things, quite a nabhi catch. Nowthat Shri Mataji has blessed so many of us with beautiful children, we are starting to sing the age old nursery rhymes once again, remembering the song of our own childhoods. Our beloved Mother once explained how one or two refer to Her or certain aspect of Sahaja Yoga, and the writer has taken the liberty of looking at some more from the angle of Sahaja Yoga. Hopefully the ideas will be enjoyable to all mums and dads and other interested parties. "Oranges and lemons, says the bells of St. Clement's, Iowe youfive farthings, say the bells of St. martin's. When will you pay me? Say the bells of Old Bailey When I grow rich, say the bells of Shora-ditch. When will that be? Say the bells of Stepney. I do not know, says the great bell of Bow." The third rhyme that Mother commented on is also something of a waning but has a sweetness about it too, It goes like this. Firstly here are three that Shri Mataji herself talked about: "ladybird, ladybird, fly away home. The New Jerusalem starts from London, England, which is the heart of the universe and at present the home of Shri Mataji. But when Shri Mataji came to London to call Her Children, many were damaged to the point of "Falling down" and She has had to use every conceivable method to build us up again. Someone madea song about this long ago and the children still sing it: your house is on fire, your children are gone." Mother told us that She is the ladybird in the song. A ladybird is a little red beetle with seven black spots on its back. (It is very common in many countries including England and the Himalayas. It likes to eat damaging aphids which ruin rose bushes and is the gardener's best friend). The second line of the rhyme is self explanatory to Western Sahaja Yogis who have seen the dreadful attacks on Shri Mataji's children which can even make them run away. Her house is perhaps the Sahasrara of the seekers, which is often buming instead of cool to begin with, when they first come for realization. "London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down, London bridge is falling down, my fair lady. Help to build it up again, up again, up again, Help to build it up again my fair lady. Build it up with sticks and stones, sticks and stones, sticks and stones. Build it up with stick and stones, my fair lady". There are a large number of nursery rhymes in English and here are a few more which would appear to be about Sahaja yoga. Firstly, in case the ego should come up too much: Shri Mataji is the fair lady. There is another very apt nursery rhyme about London, and this one is about lemons (Chillies being unknown in England until recently) and bells, which have long been used to frighten off negative forces. The song happens to refer to bells of churches in the city of London, which is nowadays the financial capital of the world and "Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall, Humpty Dumpty had a big fall, All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put Humpty together again."

 36 Issue: 9 & 10 - 2006 The Divine Cool Breeze To finish, here are two rhymes which glorify Shri Mataji in two of Her many aspects. Firstly, as Shri Adi Kundalini: Humpty Dumpty was an ego. Another very well known one is Baa Baa Black Sheep: "Baa Baa Black Sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full. One for the master and one for the dame. And one for the little boy who lives down the lane." "Thad a little mut tree and nothing would it bear, But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear. The King of Spain's daughter came to visit me All for the sake of my little mut tree." The nut tree would be the Kundalini while the silver nutmeg is presumably the moon which glorifies the left side. (Nutmegs are used as a sleeping draught, sleep being to do with the left side), The golden pear would be the sun whose place is the right side. In olden days Spain was supposed to be a source of great wealth and splendour so the king of Spain's daughter would be someone very special. Could it be that the princess is the Grace of Shri Mataji, which comes to visit the seeker because of the Kundalini, and to give moksha or realization. A black sheep is an expression used to describe the odd one out, the eccentric, the one who does not fit in with the accepted norms. Only too often the Western seeker are "black sheep". Perhaps the rhyme explains why. The wool may be the rubbish of conditioning and the unnecessary ideas with which we clutter up our egos and super-egos. The one bag is given to the master, the right side the other to the dame, the left. Surely the little boy down the lane is the Shri Ganesha. Children manage to sing quite gruesome songs with great gusto and detachment, and this one is an example: We have all looked into the sky just after dusk and seen Venus shining so gloriously for it is the brightest star in the sky. The planet Venus is one of the seats of Shri Mataji in the solar system. Everyone knows this one: "Goosey Goose Gander, whither shall 1 wander? Upstairs and downstairs and in my lady's chamber.

 The Joy of Sahaja World So much joy, love, sweetness is flowing, overflowing, flooding everything and every one: We realize how much we have to change inside, learn humility become more pure and subtle inside. With Mother's Grace it will all happen. Right now we try more to become deeper in Sahaja Yoga-treasure of Love !! Is it possible that we receive such Blessing! Is it possible we would deserve such heavenly treatment! Is it possible to be such a close collectivity-all over the world! Is it possible to feel, to be in such overwhelming unity, all together, in One body, One Ocean, One Breath, the Holy Breath !!. Annick (Paris) It is amazing how many people are taking to the path of seeking, despite the highly negative society and life style. It is really a very strong desire for realization that ultimately wins through. Sometimes I feel I am dreaming. Everything is so perfect, beautiful, well set, even with its crisis, attacks of negativity and all this stuff in fact so useful and necessary for our growth! It is really tremendous to see the new Sahaja Yogis giving up their old life styles and taking to the path of Sushumna and what, what a fantastic change there is in their complete nature, character and even appearance!! let Gods plans and the way He works them out are too fabulous! Let our eyes be always more open, to see, our ears be always more open, to hear, let our hearts be always more open, to be drenched in our Mother's love, let our mouths be always more open to sing the Lord's Praise, to sing the Adi Shakti's Praises, to sing the Highest Mother's, the Highest Being's Praises. Karan (San Diego) March' 83 We are sure every Sahaja Yogi in the world today is offering support through their attention and desire, that this year in America will bring many seekers forth to our Mother's Holy feet to receive their realization. It is only through the desires of Her Children that Shri Mataji can, raise America to be the voice of Spiritual wisdom on Earth and bring the collective consciousness to great reality with us all. Jai Mataji. Jai to Her Lotus Feets Ruth (Rome) * *** How lucky and fortunate we all are to be under the care and protection of Her Love. ***** Without Sahaja Yoga how could we all feel this closeness even thousands of miles apart, we are all one together in reality.

 Issue: 9 & 10-2006 41 The Divine Cool Breeze but our vibrations should be alright, the attention should be at the Sahasrara. The fight against the negativity is not fighting it, but keeping our vibrations well, while facing it. Sometimes when one is not strong enough, one could get away, physically removed, from it. just a person alone, but the whole lot of people who grow and enjoy together!! Surabhi (Sydney) But our vibrations, our attention is the first priority. Other things are mere excuses, not from the Spirit, but from sSomewhere else, to keep us away from Mother. If we do what the Spirit says, our vibrations are good and Mother takes care of everything. Even if we do not have anything we are happy and enjoy. That happens. Not amake-believe state. It lasts. It is everything. So when we face ourselves we are at peace Coming of Spring It is spring and Mother has filled it with beautiful flowers and green grass. It is a splendid day and all the west Australian wild flowers are out. All the colours of the flowers glistening in the early moming rays, the birds singing their tunes of joy, and 'the Silence' - that Joy of Thoughtlessness-just looking., smelling and enjoying our Mother's wonderful creation- the Earth, the living sphere supporting our Mother Kundalini!! with ourselves and God.

 Miraculous Escape from Tsunami The Divine Grace of H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Everybody is aware of TSUNAMI episode, which shook and shattered several places including the group of islands of Andaman and Nicobar in Indian Ocean on 26-12-04 morning. Nobody knew to escape from the tyranny of the tsunami waves devastating on lives and properties, but during it the Divine Saved all the Sahaja Yogis in that island area. miraculously no storm of earthquake could affect the flame of the candle. I realized the Devi Kabach everyday was a must as told by Shri Mataji. I was quite calm and quite. In front of Her photograph, I said, "Her this daughter is joyously ready to accept Her desire - Jaisse Rakho Baise Raho". While none ventured to enter the houses, I went to cook to serve others outside. I was confident that In a village Gyarra Charma of Port Blair, Andaman, where the premier centre of Sahaja Yoga is run on every Friday evening, the yogini Mrs. Puspa Samaddar who conducts the centre nothing could happen to us being Sahaja Yogis. One Sahaj Yogi was in his brother's place near sea-shore. He saw tsunami's dragonian 30ft- high waves and also sinking jetty. He realized the saviour role of Shri Mataji and rushed to the centre for refuge. He spent there next 3 months peacefully. has witnessed the disaster and she narrates her experience as follows:- "It was Sunday, 26-12-04 morning, I was meditating with my son at the lotus feet of H.H. Shri Mataji. I felt a swinging movement and initially mistook it as Divine vibrations. But after opening my eyes I found a pipe of our asbestos roof ratteling on, and so I shook my son. We were in the process of reading Devi Kabach, my son said, "Mummy, don't worry, Shri Mataji is with us" and we completed the reading. Witnessing the continuous roaring ocean, next day I worshipped the ocean with vibrated kumkum, Haldi, water, flower etc., uttering the "Samudra-Shant' and 'Bhumikamp-Shant' mantras arising from my inner-self and then the ocean there calmed down. When I joined my office after 3 days, my disturbed colleagues asked me, 'Aap Kiss Chakki ka atta khata hai? I replied, The chakki is beyond description as it is the Adi Shakti Herself, my After that, we took the holy photograph of Shri Mataji and set an altar in our lawn, lit the candle and started playing the cassette where Shri Mataji explains 7 chakras with intermittent songs Guru Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. at full volume. In the tsunami tragedy about 30-40 thousands were lost in Andaman area. We all Sahaja yogis with our belongings remained safe". A fury of the tsunami waves was at its peak, already swallowing the area of Port Blair, but Jai Shri Mataji

 MA KIS VIDHI KARUN STUTI TUMAHARI (Dr. Rajiv Kumar) (Presented in The Lotus Feet of H.H. Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi on the occasion of Her 81st Birthday Falicitation program) Ma kis vidhi karun stuti Tumahari Tum palanhari, jag ki rakhwari, Sab sankat tari, dukh bhaya bhanjan kari, Par mein kya janu yeh uunchi batein, Meri to Tu hai bas Mayya Pyari Ma kis vidhi karun stuti Tumahari Devon ke uupar pahunchaya Mahadev ka marm jataya, Shakti-Shiv ka milan dikhaya Sadashiv ka marg jataya, Antarman pratibimbit karvaya, Ma maine yeh sab bas yuhin paya. Mantramugdh mein abodh balak, Mein kya janu yeh uunchi baten, Mujhe to bhaye Teri chhavi nyari Teri bindiya pyari, Teri mahima bhari, Meri to Tu hai bas mayya pyari Ma kis vidhi karun stuti Tumahari Kaun Manipur Kaisa Anhat? Chhod chale ham in chakron ke chakkar. Saton Swargon ke bhi Uupar, Barah adityon ko vash mein kar, Samuhikta mein puure jam kar, Bas mast huye chaitanya ko pikar. Purn trupt hain yeh tere balak, Teri mamta ke aabhari, Tujh par balihari, Tere Aanchal ki chhaya nyari, Tu raj dulari, Teri chhavi pyari, Meri to Tu hai bas mayya pyari Ma kis vidhi karun stuti Tumahari. JAI SHRI MATAJI

 MA KIS VIDHI KARUN STUTI T UMAHARI (English translation) Mother how do I sing your prayers You are the nourisher, Protector of the world Remover of all obstacles, The One who does away with all sorrows and fears But I am ignorant of all this high ideas and talks For me, You are simply the Beloved Mother Mother how do I sing Your prayers? You have lifted us above the gods, Revealed to the essence of Mahadeva Shown to us the conjunction of Shiva withShakti Led us on the path to Sadashiva Illuminated our inner self and world Mother You have given all this to us just like that! Me the mantra-bound and innocent child, I know nothing of this high talk I simply like your incomparable look Your lovely bindi, Your unending compassion, For me, You remain the Beloved Mother Mother how do I sing Your prayers? What is this small talk of Manipur and Anhat, We have left behind these rituals of the chakras, Having risen above the seven heavens We now control the fate of the twelve Adityas. Rooted firmly in the enlightened sangha. We are mast and enraputured with Chaitanya Fully satisfied are Your children, Grateful eternally for Your motherly love, We wish our lives be added to Yours, because Incomparably soothing is the shade of Your saree You are the princess with adorable countenance But you above all are my most Beloved Mother Mother how do I sing Your prayers? JAI SHRI MATA JI

 "After realization you all had lots of knowledge (S7) about Kundalini and Sahaja Yoga but without Bhakti you cannot achieve the balance. You have to get lost in Bhakti. Bhakti enriches your feelings. Try to feel the other Sahaja Yogis without criticising them. I am enjoying your beings, the beauty and glory that you are. I wish you all could do that and feel like a drop in the ocean itself. Bhakti will dissolve your angularities and impediments in the collective oneness. H.H.

 Soma's stay in Chiswick in Shri Mataji's house
for more than a month
(Chiswick - U.K. - 18 June, 2006)
It was such a blessing for me to cook for Shri
Mataji for more than a month. It was the most
precious time ofmy life.
on Buddha Purnima Day and Rohit was also
there, so we saing Mata ka Karam again infront
of Shri Mataji and Sir C.P.
It started on 5th of May (Sahasrara Day). Me
and Pramila left the Puja site to cook in Mother's
house. As soon as we reached the house, Aunty
Saxena (Incharge of kitchen from India) said
that today is Sahasrara day, so make every
possible nice thing for Devi's Bhog. So we made
lots of things from our heart. In the evening with
some other Austrian brothers and sisters, we
had the opportunity to attend a small puja in
presence of Shri Mataji and sang Bhajans. It
was always my desire to sing Sahasrara Swamini
in front of Shri Mataji and it happened like this
that I could sing Sahasrara Swamini on
Sahasrara Day with the bhajan group. We also
sang Mata ka karam, which Shri Mataji and
Sir C.P. liked very much.
Next day was Mother's Day. There were
offerings from different countries. Austrians also
brought beautiful cakes and flowers. On that
day an amazing thing happened: around 12
o'clock in the night Shri Mataji asked for
Aarti Hereself. We all ran up in the living room
and sang Aarti. It was like a Pujaand Shri Mataji
was wearing the Austrian Shawl which is a
collective effort of all the ladies inAustria. Sabine
was also there. So we were so happy. Later on
when I had an opportunity to cook with Kalpana
Didi, she said that the shawl is made with so
muchheart and Amma (Shri Mataji) liked it very
much. This shawl and Scarf were wom by Shri
Mataji quite a few times whenever She went
out.
On 7th, on Sahasrara Puja day, I went to cook
again. Aunty said make different kinds of sweets
for prasad. We started making different types
of sweets one after the other. Some sweets I
made first time and they all tumed out very nice.
I felt as if I was not doing anything and Shri
Mataji was doing all. Bengal is very famous for
sweets, as I come from that part of India I felt
that Shri Mataji is working out something
through this.
The Austrian Mother's day card was always in
the bedroom of Shri Mataji as a piece of
decoration, just opposite of Her chair. Aren't
the Austrians lucky?
Once Shri Mataji was sitting on dinning table
during breakfast just infront of the kitchen door.
We were all busy preparing breakfast. She
looked at all of us. We all did namaskar, it was
a very nice Darshan.
Next day when I came to Shri Mataji's house
Bhanu asked so where is the boy who sang
Mata ka karam so nicely, Sir C.P. wants him to
be here. It was Rohit, Sir C.P. liked his style of
singing. So Rohit had to fly back again from
Austria. We had a very beautiful Buddha Puja
Kalpana Didi was there for some days, we had
opportunity to cook with here for three days.
We cooked together: Akhni pulao, Kashmiri
chicken, Keema, Egg curry, moongdal vada.
She told us that most of them are from Shri
Mataji's recipe.

all the Yuvas. It was a wonderful evening.
Suddenly Shri Mataji said that She did not want
to go in the wheel chair and She wants to
walk, and really She came walking from
Living room to bedroom. It was the most
extra-ordinary event. The whole house was
bubbling with joy, everybody saying Shri
Mataji is walking! Since then She always
walked from the bedroom to the living room
We often sat in the corridor while Shri Mataji
was sitting in the living room and watching
something in T.V. We watched a few Hindi films
together: Lagaan, Mugal-E-Azam, Dil Chahata
Hai... Once we watched Sahasrara Puja 2006
and sang aarti, it was very nice. Often when we
were free we used to meditate on the lawn
facing Shri mataji's bedroom window, or just
infront of Shri Mataji's room. Such deep
meditations we had!
and back.
On 7th June we (kitchen team) went to offer
flowers to Shri Mataji. We all did Pranam. It
was such a nice moment! Sir C.P. said you all
cook so many things, nice food and you are
spoiling us. It was a very nice Darshan.
Once Shri Mataji played harmonium Herself,
we all ran up from the kitchen to see that, it was
a wonderful scene. Then Sir C.P. sang two lines
of Gazal: "Dil me kisi ke rah kiye ja raha
hun main, kaisa haseen gunah kiye ja raha
hun main". It was so nice, such a wonderful
evening! Just like a music programme in heaven.
Before Kalpana didi left she gave valuable gifts
to everybody in the house. She called me in her
room and opened here hand: a pair of very
beautiful golden earrings with rubies. I said its
too much. She said its mother's blessings. I was
in tears. She hugged me and said Austria has a
nice collective and Wolfgang is a very nice
person. Then she said see you in Cabella. It
was an unforgettable moment.
On 8th June we watched the Austrian Bahajan
DVD first time together with Shri Mataji. We sat
in the corridor and Shri Mataji in the living room.
Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. both liked the Bhajans.
I was sitting and singing, and I felt that I am
sitting and singing with the other Austrians. It
was an amazing moment. I was so proud to be
Austrian. After that many a times Shri Mataji
and Sir C.P. watched that DVD and specially
the song 'Mata Ka Karam'. Even on the 2nd
day of evening programme of Adishakti Puja
She watched Mata Ka Karam'and again when
She came back after puja She listened to the
same song. Isn't it amazing?
Once Fench Yuva Shaktis came to give gifts on
the occassion of their Mother's Day and they
sang a very soft and sweet song which was
very touching. We were sitting in Shri Mataji's
dining area and watching. It was very nice.
On the Adishakti Puja Day we had feet washing
ceremony of Mother in the morning. It was like
asmall Puja. Then they asked five ladies of the
house to bring the laxmi baskets to Shri Mataji.
I was one of them. Me and Aunty were carrying
beautiful Cranberry glass sets. We offered it to
Shri Mataji and did Pranam. She was very
happy. Sir C.P. said these cranbery glass things
are very precious. I felt that I had the most
On 6th June the Yuva Shaktis came to sing
Bahajans. They sang very beautifully. The whole
house was full of joy and charged with
vibrations. Sir C.P. talked to the Yuvas and
asked them to spread Sahaja among the Young
generation. They presented pictures of the Yuva
Shakti Ashram. After that Sir C.P. said to feed

precious moment of my life. When we came
out Rachel was asking me about the shopping
list and I said Rachel I can't think anymore,
Rachel said the same. After sometime we
For more than a month I had the opportunity to
serve God Herself. It was the most precious
time of my life. Icould make Breakfast, lunch,
dinner, chai andeverything whatever was in my
heart and whatever Shri Mataji wanted. Working
there I felt that as if I am not doing anything.
She is giving the ideas and I amjust moving my
hands. There were many things which I made
there first time but everything tumed out nicely.
Once we had to get the dinner ready in 45
minutes which is normally quiet impossible, but
everything was finished at the right time. So,
She does it all.
started again to make shopping list, to cook and
so on. On the Puja day, together with some
Indian food, I could make Austrian Schnitzel.
After Shri Mataji had lunch we all got ready for
Puja and waited outside, so that when She goes
in the car we will also jump in the van. When
Shri Mataji was going in the car we all did
namaskar and She raised Her hand for
blessings. It was amazing. We went to the Puja
and for the first time in my life I was sitting in
the first row. Shri Mataji was very happy during
the Puja and after Puja, when we were dancing
with the qawali in front of Mother, She was
smiling at us. So sweet....
When I came back I felt that I came back from
heaven to earth. It was really a different world
there. The birds always singing, beautiful
blossoms everywhere. Everything was beyond
time there. Sometimes the dinner used to be
finished by 4 in the moming, sometimes half past
two or three. Everything was so beautiful. We
were always full with joy and vibrations. What
more a Sahaj Yogi wants.... That's was my stay
in Heaven on Earth.
We came back home made the dinner ready. It
was my last day. When Shri Mataji finished
dinner. I said bye bye to everybody. I was in
tears and felt that I am going away from my
parent's house to in-law's place.I didn't cry so
much when I had to leave India even.
Jai Shri Mataji

Shri Mataji graciously hosted an informal
programme of farewell with the UK SY

eve of Her departure to Italy. The committee
were given some beautiful gifts from Shri Mataji,
and the Yuva Shakti sang to Her in their own

 History created as our Mother visited yuva-shakti
ashram in London To Bless The YuvaShakti
Dear Sahajis,
As you know, yesterday, Shri Mataji and Sir
C.P. came to the Yuvashakti Ashram in Lodnon
to see and bless it.
and asked us with a smile:
"Do you agree?"
.and everybody said out clearly and loudly:
"Yes!"
It was really amazing, there presence was so
beautiful, I can'teven describe it in words. They
arrived at around 8.30 pm and all of us were
awaiting them in the living room, squelched
together, but very excited. We got up and started
singing "Swagata Agata".
It was quite amazing, and then he said.
"If you like, you may as well sing a bhajan!"
and of course, having prepared the bhajans, we
started singing: "Jai Jagadambe Aye Re, Meri
Nirmal Maa" and after that Mother drank
some water and was saying "Ah!"... Baap Re...
"Ah!" after like every sip of water.
There vibrations were so strong, it was
awesome. The car arrived and all the uncles
and aunties came into the living room to check
ifeverything was alright. And the Mother came
in first, sitting in the wheelchair and Sir C.P.
followed.
.... then Sir C.P. talked to us again "It all started
here for the Western world, the Sahaj
Movement" and then he said "we hope, that by
this day today (13 June 2006) there will be a
new start in the same way!" Then he said, "We
will take leave now". and everybody looked
with big eyes.. and then he said "but if you want,
you can sing another bahajan for 5 minutes" and
we all started singing "Jago Savera Aya Hai,
Mata Ne Bulaya Hai".
Mother asked us to sit down and said "Baith
Jao" (=sit down) in Hindi and we were just
blasted by the vibrations. Then Mother was
watching us and we were just sitting there... and
then Sir C.P. stared off saying:
"Do you know why we came here today? We
came here, because She wanted to come here.
We came here, because it was important to her.
After that, they took leave and said "We really
enjoyed our stay here in the U.K. and we will
certainly come back again".
She came to this country (meaning the U.K.) in
1974 to spread the word of Love and started
Sahaja Yoga for the Western world. She has
been travelling for 35 years in all the continents.
Everybody clapped and we sang "Mataji,
Mataji... Your face shines like a thousand
suns, you have give us more than we could
ask for, Bliss and Peace and Harmony"
Now She wants to pass on the responsibility to
you, the Yuvashakti, the future of Sahaja Yoga!
Afterwards we were all enjoying each other's
company and actually could'nt really believe
what just had happened..
"She came here today to give her blessings! She
wants You to take over and to spread the
message of Sahaja Yoga"
Lots of love from London

Then he looked at her, and looked back at us:

(Cheswick U.K. 11th June, 2006)
Speech by Sir Chandrika Prasad Srivastava after the gift-session: (A Transcript)
"May I first bow down to the Goddess, may I
bow down to all of you angels. This is a gathering
of angels on earth and I am very fortunate to be
a part of it. I am deeply and profoundly grateful
to all the Sahajayogis and Yoginis of United
Kingdom and of allof the world, that they gave
us an opportunity to be here. Ever since our
arrival in the United Kingdom we have been
looked after with absolute utmost love, affection
and care. It is impossible to describe to you
our feelings of gratitude and, you know, it's like
home coming. So, Dr. Spiro to you, to all,
everyone I want to convey of our feelings of
deepest love and abiding of profound gratitude.
Her message, the message of Sahaja Yoga
which is made of Love which unites men and
women and children of all the countries as one
human family.
For She has now, my children, you take over
that responsibility, spread the message of Sahaja
Yoga, and so 2 years ago She decided to
establisha World Council for the Advancement
of Sahajayoga and that council has been
functioning. And since then She has also
requested, invited and urged all Sahajayogis
from the world to form collective leadership to
involve as many as possible in the task of
spreading Sahajayoga, and that has been done.
In the United Kingdom thereisa collective body
now and in many countries of the world. That
collective body, collectively Sahajayogis and
Sahajayoginis, are now spreading the message
of Sahajayoga, that is Her wish and She is very
happy that this has happened. Sahajayoga has
to be spread in that fashion.
I want to take a few minutes of your time to say
a few things also which are very important to
Her point of view.
You know for 35 years She has travelled around
the world carrying the message of Sahajayoga
of Love for humanity, and today there is
Sahajayoga in more then 80 countries of the
world and all 5 continents, that is what She has
been doing. Clapping...
Now it is not my intention to take lot of your
time but look at the world, you will find there is
trouble, there is violence. There is one message
which can save the world, and the message is
Her message, Her message of Love in
Sahajayoga. You are here a witness to that!
She has travelled by plane, She has travelled
by helicopter, She has travelled by car, by bus
and if you please by bullock-cart in India and
of course on foot
.clapping.
Can you find a gathering like this here anywhere
else in the World? No, because you are bound
by love together, and what She says is, yes,
there is a World Council, they have to advance
Sahajayoga, but there is a message to you also:
Each one of you should regard yourselves
as Her Messenger for spreading that
Of Her 35 years She did that, then 2 years ago
She decided, that it was time for Her to sit back
and pass responsibility mostly to Her children
to spread further the message of Sahaja Yoga.
You know, the world, if you look TV news, the
world is in trouble, but there is one message,

message. You know if one of you can convey
a message to another one, one to two and two
to four, in a few years time the world will be full
of Sahajayoga, and believe me, that nothing the
world needs more today than this particular
thing,
earth, but spread this heaven, convey your
message, save the world and you can do it! So,
may I promise on your behalf that you will do
it?"
ABig Yes from the gathering of Yogis.
So, standing before Her on Her behalf, I convey
you this message to you.
Clappings..

airport, Shri Mataji would sit down talk to us.
Suddenly and spontaneously, the airport lounge
would be transformed into heaven-on-earth,
with the queen of both enthroned before Her
devoted subjects, sitting quietly on the ground
around Her. Some airport employees, drawn
perhaps by curiosity more probably by
vibrations - would hover close by in a bemused
state. Many were given their Realization
personally by our Mother. As She talked and
laughed with us-even on occasion naming our
children- the ordinary world seemed to fade
and instead we were all enveloped in a light-
filled bubble of timelessness.

How many times over the last two and half
decades-since that first visit in March 1981 -
have we yogis travelled to the airport with
excitement and anticipation in our hearts?
In the first decade the yogis-a small group of
about forty-would gather near the exit doors
with heart-filled expectation for that initial
glimpse, that comforting glance, the divine
darshan of their most compassionate Mother.

which spoke for us all; the songs of joy; Sir
CP's sweetest and kindest words that made
tears well up in our eyes from overfilled hearts.
One can only take a deep breath to absorb such
abundance.
Yet, much has changed for our collective in over
two and a half-decades.
With Her encouraging smile, She dissolved all
our fears and diffidence. We felt truly there were
no obstacles. All that was mere illusion, like
clouds becoming more and more wispy and then
disappearing to reveal a clear blue sky.
The first visible change is the new generation of
yogis, the yuva, those bom-realized children of
the 1980s and '90s who now approach
adulthood. They have been growing up within
our Mother's bandhan and belong so much more
to Her than to us, their temporary guardians.

deck and bathroom renovations, as well as new
gardens and the Burwood-like re-furnishings
and decorations, have created a perfect and holy
sanctuary for Her in the country. The diligent
and attentive preparations have in themselves
been a puja and those involved with this type of
creativity will confirm that they too feel they have
become divine instruments in the doing. People
are again saying for certain that the best work
you can be involved in, is the preparation for
her coming, and that in so doing we too are
being transformed. Jai Shri Mataji!
Over the last two years the Balmoral Country
Property has been evolving from a rough old
farm into a venue worthy of Puja to the
Goddess. Firstly, completely new additions to
the farmhouse were built to house Her in both
Subtle and Physical forms. Secondly, over time,
the grounds were transformed into parklands
and gardens featuring alarge meditation building
and grassed areas and facilities for collective
gatherings. Finally, over the Shivaratri Puja
weekend, the country property has been
completely prepared, equipped and fully utilised
for the largest gathering for Sahaja Yogis that
Australia has seen in more than ten years.

When it became apparent that our Divine
Mother would be more comfortable being at
Her home in Burwood for the Shivratri Puja,
the best possible configurations were designed
to help everyone feel part of this great event.

everyone could see the actual Puja ceremony,

Almost 1300 yogis from Australia, New
Zealand and abroad gathered for two
unforgettable nights of music and joy prior to
the Puja in Sydney. The first on Friday evening
was a spontaneous and growing bhajan session
that began with focussed joy and escalated and
expanded through several stages into a collective
state of blissful union. Such events prove that
you are truly a part and parcel of One Body
and that your Mother is ever present within you
and Her great Sahaja family. The second evening
also ran into the very small hours and featured
a truly awesome showcase of extremely good
and varied performances of music and dance.

results are truly inspiring. Great young souls are

We went to the "Sahaja Yoga International
Health and Research Centre", which is a

the Yogis. It is about an hour out of Bombay. It
is an amazing place, as is most of what happens
to you in Sahaja Yoga. The blessings flow like
a waterfall when you're in the attention of the

where you expressly go to look into yourself

your doctor from 1lam to 1.30pm (you go to
the treatment room and wait your tum, and your
doctor works on your catches and irons them

treatment by our doctor (afterwards or before
you do your "homework" which is prescribed
for your specific problems in your subtle system)
Dinner at 7.30 pm 8.30 to 10pm is Collective

afterwards sign bhajans with joy and

Today we are celebrating here in this holy land

could destroy all those people who tried to harm
the divine manifestation.
This "Samhara shakti" is expressed as the
Chakra (Sudarshan) in His hand. And another
is the "Gada" (Mace) in His hand. These two
incarnations. He is one of the aspects, Shri
Krishna is one of the aspects ofthis Adi Shakti
who came on this Earth as Radha. She is the
powers were within Him, and He acted
according to the power of Radha, because She
is the one who sustained, the power of Shri
Krishna. The proof of that is this that when He
was in Gokul with Radha He did all His
"Samhara' work. And afterwards He just
became a chariot driver for Arjuna. So for His
disciple Arjun. He became evenachariot driver.
same who came as the Mother of Christ, and
She gave the name of Christ as Khrist the
surname of Shri Krishna, as if it is Krishna's
name, from Krishna. He's called as "Krisht" in
Indian languages, Krisht. And I have told you
before why He was called as Yeshu or Jesu.
So today we are going to see the two aspects
of Shri Krishna, which were the manifestation
of His divine birth.
The another great quality of Yogeshwara was
complete discetion power built in. So He knew
who was a devil and who was not, who is good,
who is bad, who is posessed, who is not
posessed, who is innocent, who is not. This was
built in within Him, this power of complete
discrimination.
In Rama's life they showed a man; man, a
Purushottama, the best of the father in worldly
affairs. And in Shri Krishna's life they showed
him the highest fatherhood as in Yogeshwara or
in divine work. So the first aspect of Shri Krishna
we have to understand is the Yogeshwara and
the second aspect of his as the Virata.
And He had a capacity more expressing His
witnesshood, asa 'Sakshi'. He had the capacity.
I mean He was a Sakshi Himself-I should say
this way is easier to understand. He was a
Sakshi, He had the capacity of witnessing the
whole world as a play. At the time of Rama,
Rama was one who got involved into His
problems, to show as if He is a full human being,
Yogeshwara means the Lord of the Yoga, or
the Power of Yoga. He is called because He
reached the optimum that one has to reach as a
Yogi. As if He is the ideal you have to reach.
Now as a Yogi, He was born of a royal family
but he lived in the jungles, in the forest, with
cows, with ordinary people. He used to sleep

not hear. It has no effect on Him, no retention
on Him, no action on Him. Whatever He is, He
is complete: sixteen petals is complete moon,
sixteenth day of the moon is the Pumima. That
is how one has to be, complete in oneself,
complete confidence in oneself. But confidence
should not be confused with ego. But
confidence is complete wisdom, it's complete
dharma, it is complete love, complete beauty,
and is complete God. That's what it should be.
so that human beings should not say that He
was God, so how could we accept God because
'He was God after all? Now this capacity in
Him to witness has to be seen in every yogi.
The element he controls is ether. We call it
"Akasha" in Sanskrit. This ether now as you
know, we are using for our television, for our
radio, for every sort of a collective work. So
we have to be incharge of the ether element as
yogis. And that is the subtlest of all, in the sense
that you permeate everything with that, and is
above all, like plastic, also permeate into
everything into matter, into everything up to the
air. But it cannot enter into ether. So the negativity
cannot enter into ether. So when you enter into
your ethereal zone, you actually enter into the
area which is thoughless awareness. And the
sustenance of that is done by Christ, by the
Spirit. So you can realize now as a yogi, your
state of mind should be ethereal.
Now when He said that "You give up all your
dharmas and surrender to Me" in Gita, what
He was meaning is that all other things about
which you are worried "You give up and become
one with me, so I look after you". Give up the
responsibility to Shri Krishna, so the complete
integrated Divinity will start expressing through
you. Means If you say that you have to be
responsible, then He says alright, go ahead try!
But if you say that "You are responsible, I'm
justan institution or an instrument in Your hand"
then you start manifesting it well. And that is
how your Vishuddhi chakra gets opened up.
And what should be the state of your super-
ego? This is the ego part of it, that you should
be in ethereal state. And as a super-ego you
should see it as a play, you should see the play

know all the qualities of a divine brain are within.
So whatever wve do with out brain like intrigue,
the deception, all which are bad things by your
brain as they call it, are done by Him for the
divine purpose without getting any blemish upon
himself. And the other side of it, so called

So the ego and the super-ego both rise from
the Vishuddhi chakra. They can be receded by
the Agnya chakra but have to be sucked into
the Vishuddhi.
The greatest quality of Yogeshwara is that He
is not at all involved into it, detached,
abosolutely. If He eats His food, He does not
eat it. If He speaks, He does not speak. If He
sees, He does not see. If He hears, He does

concerned, because you are more powerful and
more tricky.
a play, because He's the Master, as we call, a
"Sutradhara", the one who plays with the strings
with the pantomimes.
Now the other things that we have to understand
Shri Krishna at this stage of Sajaha Yoga, that
it is the Virata Shakti that is manifesting at this
time and not the Shri Krishna Shakti which was
at His time. And the power that is working here
is not more that of Radha or of Mary, but of
Viratangana. That's why the knowledge of
Sahaja Yogis is much wider than the knowledge
of all the saints of ages. But it is not deeper than
them. If you can deepen your knowledge, this
wider knowledge will have proper roots within
you. So the brain are the roots, here are the
roots of the whole tree oflife. Actually Kundalini
comes up and waters the brain first, so that the
whole tree of life is drenched in the Divine Bliss
and Divine Knowledge.
Beacuse the Virata Shakti has now taken that
form, like the tree when it is grown, it grows
upward. But when it is laden with fruit, it comes
down. First it is attractive by its flowers, by its
timber, by the other parts of its body. And
people try to destroy it for it. But when the fruit
appear, they want to preserve it, and the tree
bends down, with humility, is very valuable.
So you are the fruits. That Viratangana Shakti,
you are the fruits. Because you are so valuable
that those people who wanted to ruin or to
destroy the Divine power from this Earth will
start thinking that they have to gain something
out of these fruits. So today the Virata Shakti
has given you á great value, because people
see that by having one Sahaja Yogi with them it
is so precious. Say one ordinary man gets his
Realization, then he develops his value. In that
his own value he can be respected, loved, and
he can be given the highest if he's a proper
Sahaja Yogi.
So this Virata Shakti that we have to work out,
gives us the sense of collective consciousness
first. First we understand it through our brain
power. But the whole brain power is to be
guided by the Heart, is to be watered; but in
Sanskrit is a very beautiful word "Sinchan" like
dew drops, spray, with the Love of God. So
the integration of this brain has to take place
with Heart and with your liver. Then only
the Virata-Shakti takes another form. The
weapons of killing become the weapons of
forgiveness. Every sort of destructive power
is used for the construction, as if it is tricked.
So you should understand today what Virata
Shakti is 'We are going to worship that Virata
Shakti which has given fruits". As a result of
that, ali these different churches, fanaticism, and
atheism and communism and all that-ism, all
these will neutralize because they will see their
benefit in it. But you have to become that. That
is the biggest thing one has to know is to bend
down towards the Mother Earth, to be humble.
Absolutely the humility inside is really going to
Like nowItold thematrick, how to trick these
gurus. The power that they have can be tricked
against them, as is said that their teeth must be

fruits.
questions to Mother, bringing personal
problems, stupid ideas, negativity, all those
people are still not yet the fruits.
Those Sahaja Yogis who boast about
themselves are like the fruit which are
But the matured people are those who
surrender, who bow to the Mother Earth. So
the capacity to bow is the best judgement of
yourself. And leaving everything to the power
of gravity of your Mother to do every work for
you. And leaving all your small little worries
behind, you have to rise above these distracting
powers and achieve the completion of this Virata
Shakti which ultimately becomes a "Madhurya
Shakti". "Madhurya", there is no word in English
language but it means a "sweet power". Like
the fruit becomes sweet. That's how you all have
everything very sweet in the sense it was all a
Madhurya Shakti that was acting, all His play,
all His dancing. All His stories if you read, is
nothing but Madhurya Shakti, towards Gopas
and Gopis, towards other Sahaja Yogis.
getting ruined only on the tree. The only
fruits that bend down are accepted as good and
matured fruits, and not those who assert that
they are the highest. But some of the negative
people should not by any chance take advantage
of this and say that they are good because they
are bending down. It's not the logic. Some of
them
pose they are humble; even a rotten fruit
bends down. But the mature fruit shows its
humility by its weight. That is the guru tattwa
weight.
So from the Viratangana power you get the
power of maturity up to the fruit and then we
become blessed by Guru Principle. Those who
are still involved in getting to better sunshine or
getting to better water supply of all these things,
are not yet matured, because the fruit doesn't
need anything from the Mother Earth, nor from
the elements. But it surrenders, bends, it bows
to the Mother Earth.
So you have to keep your Mother pleased by
pleasing other Sahaja yogis, and not other
people. They are not important. So today we
are going to shorten the Puja, and that's why it
took so much time upstairs, fo shorten it! So
the time lost is time gained for ever and ever.
So the Sahaja Yogi who goes on asking
May God Bless You.

 VISHUDDHI CHAKRA
Puja Parvachan of H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Vienna -4.9.1983
that is what He has said that "surrender your
ego to Me", so that when you say a mantra or
utter words, they are effective as weapons,
good weapons, effective good weapons,
efficient.
Before going to America, I wanted to speak
more about the Vishuddhi chakra and about Shri
Krishna's aspect within us. In the first puje
Geneva, I spoke quite a lot about it, but there is
no end to it, of course, because it is the centre
of Virata. But one has to realize that the message
of Shri Krishna was to surrender. Now the
surrendering that we think in the gross way is
like an enemy surrenders to another enemy.
when the word "surrender" is spoken, we build
up our barriers by thinking that we have to
surrender something to the other part. But when
Shri Krishna was talking about surrender, He
was saying that "surrender your enemies to me
so that I will get rid of them".
Now when we talk, let us see how I see your
ego expressed in your talk, so that you will
So
understand how to address Me and to judge
yourself. For example shaking your necks too
much is a sign of a Mr. Ego shaking head for
nothing at all. Like many people have a habit
"yes" if it is said, they'll go on like this for ten
times. There is not need. Actually, you should
move only once, with humility, the head "yes
Mother" it is all right. You must move your neck
with respect and with understanding that Shri
Krishna is sitting there. With dignity. But we
forget it all the time and we start using it to assert
ourselves when we talk to someone. And we
shake too much or we push it in such a way
that another person is sort-of dominated by it.
Now the worst enemy that we have is our ego.
And with ego starts all kinds of other problems,
because it is the biggest barrier for our growth.
And the ego starts as you know from the
Vishuddhi chakra, and can be sucked into
Vishuddhi chakra.
Now there is another method when you talk to
Me, like saying "no Mother". Itis very common,
ifI say anything, the first reaction of people could
be "no Mother". After all you see there is a
course going on, even when I'm speaking it isa
mantra, when I'm not speaking, is a mantra
flowing. And suddenly you come out with your
"no Mother", you create a ripple back in the
whole thing. Now at that time, ifyou just listen
to Me what I'm saying, the saying itself will work
it out, you don't have to do anything. Now
another way is the style in which you talk to
Me, also I can see the right Vishuddhi acting. It
is when we talk normally to each other, if we
Now let us see how is Vishuddhi chakra made.
All the vowels that we use cone from Vishuddhi
chakra. And like in Devanagri language it is
a...ang-aha. So as you know you cannot
compile a word without a vowel, it is so
important. A consonant is weak, without any
strength, without the vowel. So the strength of
a person comes through the Vishuddhi chakra
in his speech. But it can be absolutely stiff also,
the strength could be absolutely stiff. Supposing
you have a very strong weapon but you can't
lift it, so what is the use of having a weapon like
that? See, this Mr. Ego tries to make the weapon
heavy and stiff like jammed machine-guns. Now

many types which are artificial things absolutely.
Before God, what is your property? What is
your money? What is your position? What is
your family? What is your education? You see,
these things have no value in the presence of
God. The possessions that one value so much
have no value. So one has to realize that if we
are the possessions of God, we should be
proud of one thing only, that His vibrations flow
through us. That is: He is proud of us.
have to say "yes", we'll say "m-m". That is very
common here "a-a". This style, they say "hum-
um" and then on top of that to say "mm-mm" as
if you see it clearly. It is: you are not receiving
anything in it, but you are trying to sort of put it
to an equal pressure on the flow.
The humility is the best way of conquering this
ego of Vishuddhi. And when talking to others,
try to develop sweet methods, sweet ways
unhurting other people. And you will be
surprised that Vishuddhi will immediately start
behaving in such a sweet manner, because the
bhoots don't like sweetness, they are
quarrelsome, they are harsh, they are always
trying to say something to hurt.
Like supposing you give Mea fruit or a Ganesha,
or anything, it gets very much valued because I
have touched it and the vibrations are there. Like
this Ganesha now for example, if you see the
value is zero as far as the metal is concerned,
but when made into an art-piece has some much
more value. In this world, the value increases
with art, but in the realm of God, or in the
spiritual world or Divine world, the value of a
Ganesha, the same Ganesha will be a thousand
times more than what it is just now as just an art
piece. So that is now what is given to you, a
very high value. So the pride and the vanity of
artificiality, artificial things, is all man-made,
mythical, and should be surrendered because it
is a myth.
So this Vishuddhi on the right hand side is to be
controlled by surrendering as it is said. Actually
you surrenderyour ego to begin with. And this
ego when you surrender, it has to be done from
your heart, it should not be a lip-service. From
your heart: "I don't want this ego any more. I
want Reality." "Let the Reality be seen by me,
felt by me, enjoyed by me." And once you start
doing it from your heart, you will be amazed
that your voice will become sweet. Apart from
that, it will have the Divine Power flowing through
it. That is what we say that you have now "wak
shakti", means the power of speach.
Then the human mind has another capacity to
be jealous, to be jealous of others. This also
comes from unwise understanding. If you
surrender your jealousies at the Lotus Feet of
God, Imean, you are doing all rubbish actually.
The stupid jealousies that you have are as you
know, of no value, neither in this world, nor in
that world. The most surprising thing is that the
Sahaja Yogis feel jealous of each other! And I
still can't understand how can it be? If you are
standing in the sunshine, then you all are jealous
So when you surrender ego, what you do
actually is to say that "I'm not doing anything, it
is You who do everything". So that a little drop
has now become an ocean. And so your sound
has got the power of the ocean.
Now the second thing you have to surrender, is
the pride, or vanity. Now the vanity can be of

 Guru Puja
28 July, 1996
(Pravachan of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi)
That may be the reason they were not so much
concerned. All the time they were testing their
deciples. Even Ramdas, the Guru of Shivaji
was testing even Shivaji for so many times,
though he was a born realized. So to get this
Guru pad, this position of a guru, after that they
had to work very-very hard to achieve a state
of a saint. But in Sahaja Yoga that is not the
case as you know. I just thought if people get
their realisation they will see forthemselves what
is wrong in them. They will introspect
themselves and will try to correct themselves.
It is true for many-many people but some of
them still are lingering behind and are going on
and on and on and thinking that they are Sahaja
Yogis they have achieved a lot, they are
something very special. So this delusion is all
the time is creating this problem. This delusion
makes them very narrow minded, selfish, self-
centered and people cannot believe how can
they be Sahaja Yogis!
Today we have gathered here to do Guru Puja.
The system started long time back in India, I
think, even at the time of Patanjali, may be even
earlier when there were great seekers and their
gurus were sitting in the jungles where they used
to get permission to go there and then they would
get their realisation, very few of them, one or
two. So we had many rishis and munis in the
olden times in India. So the system of guru
started. Also one of the reasons is that there is
no organized religion in India. There is no Pope,
there is no priest, nothing like that. There are
priests for just worshiping in the temples. But
for giving realisation, for talking about higher
life, they all had to go to very great realized souls.
And it was absolutely the freedom of the Guru
whom to accept, whom not to accept.
Everybody was tested thoroughly by the Guru,
ifthey are capable of achieving Self Realisation
or not. And this test was so hard, so difficult
and also to a point ofcruelty that very few could
pass through that test. It is not like the Sahaja
Yoga that everybody is a Sahaja yogi, it is not
like that. That of course made it a very narrow
So the first and foremost thing we have to know
is that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out because
Param Chaitnya is transmitting compassion. It
never did before, never had that kind of an
attitude whichit is there becauseIama Mother.
And this compassion has worked in this way
that you all have got your realisation, you have
achieved a state which you can call as Self
Realized Souls. But still, because you got it so
easily, cheaply, I think, still we don't realize what
we have got, still we don't practice meditation,
introspection and dedication. Some are very
much there, but mostly we are just living in the
idea that we have already achieved. So the first
margin for people to achieve their realisation
and these Gurus never used to leave their own
seats, they call it Takia. They would be there in
their own place. All those who would like to go
to him would come, ifhe allowed then only they
can meet him. You may have gone for miles
together, nothing, no obligation of the Gurus that
he should meet you. Perhaps they did not feel
that love and compassion for the seekers. They
did not understand that the seekers are ardently
seeking the truth and they should not suffer.

all the time you are worried about yourselves
then you cannot break, you cannot breakthrough
this shell of your Being which is under the
domination of your mental selfishness of self-
centeredness. Even self-centeredness is
absolutely against your growth. There are
many-many people who come, I have seen, even
to Cabella, I know they have to suffer a lot
because they think it is very open space where
they have to live and they must make all
arrangements to make themselves comfortable.
Such people have to grow still much more. For
a saint any place has to be heavenly. You
must have seen me enjoying everything, I can
live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere. I have no
demands of any kind, but if you are worried
about your body comforts, your body troubles,
still you are at a body level, which you have to
transcend. Worried about how you look, how
you dress up, what sort of things you have to
wear, all this makes you yet not a good Sahaj
| Yogi. This is one style of Sahaja Yogis who still
want very great comforts. So what you have to
do, if you are used to comforts try to go and
sleep on the street. I will not do that, but you
can do or sleep on a tree. You may fall down
doesn't matter. Do all kinds of things that are
necessary to punish your body to understand
that you are not bound to this comfort of the
body. This is one of the greatest thing that one
has to see that you are not bound by your body.
It's alright if you have comfort well and good, if
you don't have well and good. For a Sahaja
Of course, I have seen people in the West are
better off in this matter, because when they go
to India they told me they like ST buses better
than comfortable buses. So I said 'why"?
Because Mother you can jump in the bus with
all the luggage, because the windows are open,
you can breathe very natural, very good. They
wanted to go on bullock-carts also. I mean they
enjoy all that. Actually if you see, you notice in
the Western world mostly people are taking to
more rustic life. They are enjoying more the
rustic style of life than to this socalled
comfortable artificial life. Not so much Indians,
I would say, also Malaysians. I think most of
the people I have met in the Western countries
are really great because they can sleep
anywhere, they can eat anything. You ask them
how did you like the food? 'What did we eat I
don't know Mother'. That is the sign. That is
the sign of the person who is not bothered as to

nothing is needed. Joy itself is joy. You are
enjoying only joy, nothing is needed to make
you happy. You are happy because of joy that
you have in the Nirananda State. If you go and
see how these saints lived, you will be amazed!
How they manage their lives, you will be very
much amazed! How many days they used to
fast without food, never bothered about it. They
never thought it was fasting, they just used to
think we have not food so no food. Of course
what he is eating, what he is getting, what is his
taste. I like this, I like that, these words drop
up. It is not difficult. It is not difficult. You might
think that I am asking you to do something
hazardous, you see. It is not difficult at all.
Because if you have to impress people around,
you have to be like a saint. And if you are a
fussy person, if you are fuss-pot then you cannot
impress others that you have got Self-
Realisation.
don't have to go through that, you have got

your Realisation. So now you have the power
to achieve this mastery, now you have this
Many people tell me 'Mother people had to do
so much, had to go to Himalayas do this, do
that and then they got their Realization. Howis
it these people you have blessed? Even some
great saints ask me that "what right they have to
get their Realisation? Why did you give them
Realisation? What have they achieved? I said,
only their desire". Their desire was very much
there that they should get their realisation. And
that's how they got it, But now to got into only
desire is not sufficient. You have to depend on
your Self, in the light of your Spirit, you should
see what's wrong. This is very important thing.
Ask question to yourself, Why do I want this,
why do I need this, what is the purpose?"
Because as you have seen all the rest of the
world is mad, I call it mad, because they are
running after stupid things. They want things
which have no meaning to spirituality. So
spirituality itself should be self-satisfying.
If you are spiritually endowed then you are
power.
The another thing I have noticed about Sahaja
Yogis, some ofthem have grudges about others.
Sahaja Yoga is the blessings oflove, blessings
of compassion. There is not place for any kind
of hatred or any kind of revenge or anger among
Sahaja Yogis. If you have that, youmust conquer
it. It is a good chance. If you find somebody
who is very hot tempered, who is very angry
type, go and make friends with that person. Just
see if you can carry on with that person or not.
There is fusspot also make friends with such a
fuss-pot and see that you achieve that peace
which will keep you above all kinds of hatred,
all kinds of temper which is very bad thing. But
some Sahaja Yogis loose their temper very fast.
I would say they cannot be Sahaja yogis
because if you have no control over your anger
then how are you powerful of compassion and
love? But you don't even have to control it, just
there. Once you have it, that state, then you
just watch it. In the olden days the saints, mostly,
used to be very much angry type of people.
They could not bear the stupidity of the world.
self-satisfied. And this self-satisfaction
within you will lead you to that ocean of joy
about which I have been telling you and all
the scriptures have described it. For Sahaja

hot tempered, those who are good natured you
can always be friendly with the, what is so great
about that? What is so nice about it? What is
you can. As they say the water finds its own
level, in the same way this compassion has to
flow to all the places, to all the ditches,
everywhere and should find its own level. But
if you are just satisfied with yourself and
you are not bothered, you are just trying to
believe that you are a great soul because
you are a Sahaja yogi then I must say that
you are sadly mistaken. In this life time you
can achieve that state. In this life time you can
get to that state within yourself.
God's Realisation
so sweet about it? But how you speak to the
person, how you talk to that person, how you
manage that person, your love will definitely melt
him down because he is a Sahaja Yogi. I am
not saying of non-Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogis
as they are, you have to be extremely
compassionate and affectionate and love them.
Now the third thing that troubles Sahaja yogis
is that 'Mother we want God's Realisation'.
That makes Me laugh. You see, it is already
there, already there, like once you get into
the sea and you say Mother we want to go
to the bottom of the sea, you can always
Just slip and will be there!
go.
The another thing which is extremely important
for us to know that we have got this Realisation
through Mother's love. Only my compassion
has acted. Only the power of Mother's
compassion could have worked it out. Now
even if this love is flowing towards the stones
or towards the mountains or towards anything
which is very solid, the ripples come back. They
have to come back. In the same way you people
In the same way once you have developed
a kind of Self-Realisation and have jumped
into the ocean of this compassion, there is
no need to achieve anything. The sense of
achievement, 'I should be that, I should be
this,' is all coming from human hauntings.
That should be over. Now you are Godly
people. So you should not think I should
achieve this state, I should achieve that
now, who have got realisation, have to know
that compassion and love is the only power you
have got, nothing else. If you love yourself, you
state. But just go on slipping. Just giving
up all the weights that you have on your

up is 'your brains'. So they said but how do you

'very simple'. I have given up nothing, because
Iam holding nothing. What is there to give up

say
Also there are still very few people who want
to be in the front. Specially Indians will all sit
together in the front. They have no right. They
have no right to sit in front. Nobody has the
right to sit in front or to seek a place. They
should sit wherever they get seat to sit down
with complete satisfaction. Whether you sit
in front or in that corner in darkness, you
can get my vibrations, you can get
everything. So to be prominent to sit at
some place, where you are prominent is not
necessary. What is it in prominence, what
do you get? To be lost in the crowds, to be
lost into the ocean of love is the main thing.
All these are mythical that we should somehow
or other get the front place. You see in Marathi
they say.. means I have managed to get the
front seat. Front will be the back and back
All these useless ideas that we have done this,
we have done that. Anybody in Sahaja Yoga
who thinks that he is doing a lot of work for
Sahaja Yoga should give it up completely.
That is a sign of another ignorance! If you
are part and parcel of the ocean, everything is
done by ocean, you are doing nothing. You have
such ideas about yourself, shows, how little you
know about yourself. You are the ocean, and if
you are the ocean, how can you claim I have
touched this shore, I have touched that shore?
No more T is left. Once this T ness drops out
then only the universal being within you shines.
All these things are so clearly evident in our
characters. Some people are very identified,
say with their country or may be with their
worshiping style, whatever it is. All these mis-
identification have to be given up. It is very
difficult for the people because they are so
conditioned. As long as your conditioning
remains, you cannot rise above your mind which
is a myth. You cannot.
will be the front. It is very surprising how still
people are trying to achieve something so
nonsensical! Where is your mind, where is your
attention, what are you thinking? If you are
thoughtless, you will be satisfied, you will be
happy, will not ask for anything. You will not
want anything. What is there to have? What is
so important? All these ideas come from
ignorance Imust tell you, from ignorance. Once
this Hare Rama, Hare Krishna fellow came to
Me and he said that we have heard that you are
a great saint, this thing, that thing, and you have

should Ganesha stop the vibrations? Why they
are doing it I realized because once I said that
Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ. Their
identification is with Christ and Christianity, in a
very subtle way. So all the vibrations stopped.
Imagine which Shri Ganesha's music we heard
in one of the Eastern Block countries and all
the vibrations had stopped! They were singing
all the songs, all the songs of Shri Ganesha, not
one song of Sahaj Yoga! Leave alone about

There is no freedom. They are bound by their

the style they follow because what is the reason?
Reason is that they must have done 3-4 types

anything just for seeing's sake. You must react.
This is not good that is not good. IfI say it is 5
o'clock, you say it is 5 past 2 minutes 3 seconds.
This comes with terrible conditioning which has
to go, 'not to react'. Why should you react?
Then the argument starts, then fight starts and
then words come. If you tell your mind, 'nothing
doing, you are myth and I am not going to react
to anything,'99.9% problem will be solved
in, you should be able to rise into that state
of Thoughtless Awareness. Just to be
peaceful. Look at your desires with peace
and tell the desire 'Oh I am very much
satisfied, now don't come. I don't want you.
That's how you can become desireless.
There is this compassion and the compassion
that becomes actually the power. Small-small
things, you can express your love, very small-
small things and in a very sweet ways you can
Then the last but not the least is the Ego.I cannot
understand a saint having Ego! Just cannot
understand. It is so stupid to have ego. It is a
kind of a domination. If slightest things are
wrong you get angry. If somebody says
something, you get angry! That means your
power of love and compassion is still not full.
You can of course correct people when they
have to be corrected but for that you should
have this power within yourself. The person
should know that you are correcting that person
because you love that person, not for
selfishness, not for any gain. But this ego is a
very big problem and that comes up by, I should
say, ego makes you very arrogant, horrible. But
if you are humble, really not just to have the
humility ofa businessman but ifyou are humble
from within yourself, from your heart, enjoying
your humility, then this ego can run away. You
have to ask yourself now what I am angry for?
Again I come back to the same point,
'introspection', because you are not here just to
carry on some jobs but you are here to become
saints. Then this ego should be made into a great
instrument of Love and joy. You can, it is not
difficult. This one is what is ego is reactions to
things'. You can react to things in a sweet way
and you can react to things in a deadly manner.
express your love. This is very important that
the whole world today needs love and peace
and we have to give peace and love to everyone
that is possible. Of course Sahaja Yogis is very
easy, but even non-Sahaja yogis, we must treat
them with respect and love. But you should not
have a desire that you should get back anything
from them. It is whatever done is over. You have
known so many Sahaja Yogis who came to
Sahaja Yoga and gained so much and have
betrayed us. Doesn't matter. Not important
because they are going to be losers not Me. So
there is nothing to bother about these things.
The another thing is, try to see that your mind
does not react. Some people have a habit, or I
think most ofthem have, to react. You tell them
something, they will put their own one tail in it!
Never will they accept if somebody says
something. If you are reacting what will go into
your heads, what will go into your heart, what
will go into your attention? So the reaction itself
isa signof proper development in yourself. This
attention which is trying to go into all the areas
of your mind and body and everywhere is not
there. It cannot enter because as soon as it tries
to enter you shut it by reacting. You cannot see

To be the Guru and to be a mother is a very
difficult thing. Because if you see the Gurus have
been very strict disciplinarians. They always try
to discipline the disciples and be quite hard with
them. But the Mother cannot be that hard. It is
the trouble with the Mother Guru. That may be
one of the reasons that people take sometimes
Sahaja yoga for granted. You should not,
because you have got your realisation, now you
are realized souls, you are masters. So you
should look after your ascent. I don't have to
tell you what is to be done, because you have
the light in your hand and you can do that very
well. I hope today's lecture you liked very much
and you don't mind ifI have said something that
might have upset you a little bit. But still one has
to see because you all have to grow inside and
outside and we have to spread Sahaja Yoga
everywhere. So we should see everyone
whether it is woman or a man you should see
how many people you have given realisation to.
It is very important that you start giving
realisation all over the world. In this fashion it
will spread and I don't have to, then, travel so
much as nowadays I am travelling still. I think
you all should take it up upon yourselves that
you will do at least travelling around your cities,
around your places of work. You can start
talking about Sahaja Yoga openly. All the
blessings are there, all the powers are there.
You can work it out. Anybody who finds any
diffficulty can give bandhan and can manage the

of introspection by which you will get your
GURU PAD. My only, I should not say desire,
because I don't have desire, so my only vision
is that I should see all the Sahaja Yogis drenched
in the power of love, enjoying each others love,
enjoying each others relationship and improving
relationships. I know there are problematic
people, I know they are problematic, but if you
cannot solve the problem what is the use of your
becoming masters? SoI leave it to you to solve
your own problems which all you are facing and
introspection with love and compassion, not by
condemning yourselves. I am sure, you can
manage it.

 Sahaja Yoga and Nursery Rhymes
has, among other things, quite a nabhi catch.
Nowthat Shri Mataji has blessed so many of
us with beautiful children, we are starting to sing
the age old nursery rhymes once again,
remembering the song of our own childhoods.
Our beloved Mother once explained how one
or two refer to Her or certain aspect of Sahaja
Yoga, and the writer has taken the liberty of
looking at some more from the angle of Sahaja
Yoga. Hopefully the ideas will be enjoyable to
all mums and dads and other interested parties.
"Oranges and lemons, says the bells of St.
Clement's, Iowe youfive farthings, say the bells
of St. martin's.
When will you pay me? Say the bells of Old
Bailey
When I grow rich, say the bells of Shora-ditch.
When will that be? Say the bells of Stepney.
I do not know, says the great bell of Bow."
The third rhyme that Mother commented on is
also something of a waning but has a sweetness
about it too, It goes like this.
Firstly here are three that Shri Mataji herself
talked about:
"ladybird, ladybird, fly away home.
The New Jerusalem starts from London,
England, which is the heart of the universe and
at present the home of Shri Mataji. But when
Shri Mataji came to London to call Her
Children, many were damaged to the point of
"Falling down" and She has had to use every
conceivable method to build us up again.
Someone madea song about this long ago and
the children still sing it:
your house is on fire, your children are gone."
Mother told us that She is the ladybird in
the song. A ladybird is a little red beetle with
seven black spots on its back. (It is very
common in many countries including England
and the Himalayas. It likes to eat damaging
aphids which ruin rose bushes and is the
gardener's best friend). The second line of the
rhyme is self explanatory to Western Sahaja
Yogis who have seen the dreadful attacks on
Shri Mataji's children which can even make
them run away. Her house is perhaps the
Sahasrara of the seekers, which is often buming
instead of cool to begin with, when they first
come for realization.
"London Bridge is falling down, falling down,
falling down,
London bridge is falling down, my fair lady.
Help to build it up again, up again, up again,
Help to build it up again my fair lady.
Build it up with sticks and stones, sticks and
stones, sticks and stones.
Build it up with stick and stones, my fair lady".
There are a large number of nursery rhymes in
English and here are a few more which would
appear to be about Sahaja yoga. Firstly, in case
the ego should come up too much:
Shri Mataji is the fair lady.
There is another very apt nursery rhyme about
London, and this one is about lemons (Chillies
being unknown in England until recently) and
bells, which have long been used to frighten off
negative forces. The song happens to refer to
bells of churches in the city of London, which is
nowadays the financial capital of the world and
"Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a big fall,
All the King's horses and all the King's men
couldn't put Humpty together again."

To finish, here are two rhymes which glorify Shri
Mataji in two of Her many aspects. Firstly, as
Shri Adi Kundalini:
Humpty Dumpty was an ego.
Another very well known one is Baa Baa Black
Sheep:
"Baa Baa Black Sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.
One for the master and one for the dame.
And one for the little boy who lives down
the lane."
"Thad a little mut tree and nothing would it bear,
But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear.
The King of Spain's daughter came to visit me
All for the sake of my little mut tree."
The nut tree would be the Kundalini while the
silver nutmeg is presumably the moon which
glorifies the left side. (Nutmegs are used as a
sleeping draught, sleep being to do with the left
side), The golden pear would be the sun whose
place is the right side. In olden days Spain was
supposed to be a source of great wealth and
splendour so the king of Spain's daughter would
be someone very special. Could it be that the
princess is the Grace of Shri Mataji, which
comes to visit the seeker because of the
Kundalini, and to give moksha or realization.
A black sheep is an expression used to describe
the odd one out, the eccentric, the one who
does not fit in with the accepted norms. Only
too often the Western seeker are "black sheep".
Perhaps the rhyme explains why. The wool may
be the rubbish of conditioning and the
unnecessary ideas with which we clutter up our
egos and super-egos. The one bag is given to
the master, the right side the other to the dame,
the left. Surely the little boy down the lane is the
Shri Ganesha.
Children manage to sing quite gruesome songs
with great gusto and detachment, and this one
is an example:
We have all looked into the sky just after dusk
and seen Venus shining so gloriously for it is the
brightest star in the sky. The planet Venus is
one of the seats of Shri Mataji in the solar
system. Everyone knows this one:
"Goosey Goose Gander, whither shall 1
wander?
Upstairs and downstairs and in my lady's
chamber.
There I met an old man who would'nt say
his prayers.
So I took him by the left leg and threw him
down the stairs!"

Twinkle Twinkle little star, howI
you are.
Up above the world so high, like a diamond in
the sky."
How many of us cannot help wondering at Our
Divine Mother, our guiding star who is so
The word "hamsa" is the hamsa chakra, the place
of discrimination, means goose or swan.
Perhaps the second line refers to someone who
is wandering around and cannot decide whether
he wants to dwell in the Sahasrara (lady's
chamber) or not. The consequences are
revealed in the last two lines!
beautiful, so simple and yet so enigmatic?

 The Joy of Sahaja World
So much joy, love, sweetness is flowing,
overflowing, flooding everything and every one:
We realize how much we have to change inside,
learn humility become more pure and subtle
inside. With Mother's Grace it will all happen.
Right now we try more to become deeper in
Sahaja Yoga-treasure of Love !!
Is it possible that we receive such Blessing! Is it
possible we would deserve such heavenly
treatment! Is it possible to be such a close
collectivity-all over the world! Is it possible to
feel, to be in such overwhelming unity, all
together, in One body, One Ocean, One Breath,
the Holy Breath !!.
Annick (Paris)
It is amazing how many people are taking to
the path of seeking, despite the highly negative
society and life style. It is really a very strong
desire for realization that ultimately wins through.
Sometimes I feel I am dreaming. Everything is
so perfect, beautiful, well set, even with its
crisis, attacks of negativity and all this stuff in
fact so useful and necessary for our growth!
It is really tremendous to see the new Sahaja
Yogis giving up their old life styles and taking to
the path of Sushumna and what, what a fantastic
change there is in their complete nature,
character and even appearance!!
let
Gods plans and the way He works them out
are too fabulous!
Let our eyes be always more open, to see,
our ears be always more open, to hear, let our
hearts be always more open, to be drenched in
our Mother's love, let our mouths be always
more open to sing the Lord's Praise, to sing the
Adi Shakti's Praises, to sing the Highest
Mother's, the Highest Being's Praises.
Karan (San Diego) March' 83
We are sure every Sahaja Yogi in the world
today is offering support through their attention
and desire, that this year in America will bring
many seekers forth to our Mother's Holy feet
to receive their realization. It is only through the
desires of Her Children that Shri Mataji can,
raise America to be the voice of Spiritual
wisdom on Earth and bring the collective
consciousness to great reality with us all. Jai
Mataji.
Jai to Her Lotus Feets
Ruth (Rome)

How lucky and fortunate we all are to be under
the care and protection of Her Love.
*****
Without Sahaja Yoga how could we all feel this
closeness even thousands of miles apart, we are
all one together in reality.
We hope you are all enjoying yourselves, and
not letting small things stop you from being near
to Mother. Sometimes we have to fight hard,

but our vibrations should be alright, the attention
should be at the Sahasrara. The fight against
the negativity is not fighting it, but keeping our
vibrations well, while facing it. Sometimes when
one is not strong enough, one could get away,
physically removed, from it.
just a person alone, but the whole lot of people
who grow and enjoy together!!
Surabhi (Sydney)
But our vibrations, our attention is the first
priority. Other things are mere excuses, not from
the Spirit, but from sSomewhere else, to keep us
away from Mother. If we do what the Spirit
says, our vibrations are good and Mother takes
care of everything. Even if we do not have
anything we are happy and enjoy. That happens.
Not amake-believe state. It lasts. It is everything.
So when we face ourselves we are at peace
Coming of Spring
It is spring and Mother has filled it with beautiful
flowers and green grass. It is a splendid day
and all the west Australian wild flowers are out.
All the colours of the flowers glistening in the
early moming rays, the birds singing their tunes
of joy, and 'the Silence' - that Joy of
Thoughtlessness-just looking., smelling and
enjoying our Mother's wonderful creation- the
Earth, the living sphere supporting our Mother
Kundalini!!
with ourselves and God.
JAI MATA JI.
Glenda (Perth) Sept, 1983
Ashram is really a nice place to be in. You are
really enjoying with everybody all the time. Your
attention remains more on the Spirit. You see
clearly lots of things about yourselfwhich tend
to take you away from it, from Mother. It is not
Next spring we hope to do programmes in
Munich, Germany and in Budapest, the Capital
city of Hungary. Perhaps you all could give

on the occasion of Her 81st Birthday Falicitation program)
Ma kis vidhi karun stuti Tumahari
Tum palanhari, jag ki rakhwari,
Sab sankat tari,
dukh bhaya bhanjan kari,
Par mein kya janu yeh uunchi batein,
Meri to Tu hai bas Mayya Pyari
Ma kis vidhi karun stuti Tumahari
Devon ke uupar pahunchaya
Mahadev ka marm jataya,
Shakti-Shiv ka milan dikhaya
Sadashiv ka marg jataya,
Antarman pratibimbit karvaya,
Ma maine yeh sab bas yuhin paya.
Mantramugdh mein abodh balak,
Mein kya janu yeh uunchi baten,
Mujhe to bhaye Teri chhavi nyari
Teri bindiya pyari, Teri mahima bhari,
Meri to Tu hai bas mayya pyari
Ma kis vidhi karun stuti Tumahari
Kaun Manipur Kaisa Anhat?
Chhod chale ham in chakron ke chakkar.
Saton Swargon ke bhi Uupar,
Barah adityon ko vash mein kar,
Samuhikta mein puure jam kar,
Bas mast huye chaitanya ko pikar.
Purn trupt hain yeh tere balak,
Teri mamta ke aabhari,
Tujh par balihari,
Tere Aanchal ki chhaya nyari,

(English translation)
Mother how do I sing your prayers
You are the nourisher, Protector of the world
Remover of all obstacles,
The One who does away with all sorrows and fears
But I am ignorant of all this high ideas and talks
For me, You are simply the Beloved Mother
Mother how do I sing Your prayers?
You have lifted us above the gods,
Revealed to the essence of Mahadeva
Shown to us the conjunction of Shiva withShakti
Led us on the path to Sadashiva
Illuminated our inner self and world
Mother You have given all this to us just like that!
Me the mantra-bound and innocent child,
I know nothing of this high talk
I simply like your incomparable look
Your lovely bindi, Your unending compassion,
For me, You remain the Beloved Mother
Mother how do I sing Your prayers?
What is this small talk of Manipur and Anhat,
We have left behind these rituals of the chakras,
Having risen above the seven heavens
We now control the fate of the twelve Adityas.
Rooted firmly in the enlightened sangha.
We are mast and enraputured with Chaitanya
Fully satisfied are Your children,
Grateful eternally for Your motherly love,
We wish our lives be added to Yours, because
Incomparably soothing is the shade of Your saree
You are the princess with adorable countenance
But you above all are my most Beloved Mother
Mother how do I sing Your prayers?

 "After realization you all had lots of knowledge (S7) about Kundalini
and Sahaja Yoga but without Bhakti you cannot achieve the balance. You have to
get lost in Bhakti. Bhakti enriches your feelings.
Try to feel the other Sahaja Yogis without criticising them. I am enjoying
your beings, the beauty and glory that you are. I wish you all could do that and
feel like a drop in the ocean itself. Bhakti will dissolve your angularities and
impediments in the collective oneness.
