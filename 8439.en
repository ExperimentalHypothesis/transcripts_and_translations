Public program, talk after Self-realization, "Seven Chakras and their Deities" (Paane ke baad), translated from Hindi, November 11th,1973, Delhi, India

You have to do nothing at all. In Sahaja Yoga, everything gets done. In day-to-day language, the meaning of word Sahaja is 'easy’. The origin of this word is from 'Saha' and 'Ja'. These two words make the word ‘Sahaja’, meaning ‘easy’ and that is ‘born with you.’ The way our eyes are innately born, our nose is born within. We don't have to think about it.

There is no perfect image of it. The all-round beauty of a lake without ripples fully reflects within us. Not only this, but also establishes complete harmony in the person who looks at it. Similarly, when you look at some beautiful sight and the beauty of the Divine creation, you will go thoughtless and the moment you get into thoughtless awareness, the power of joy that lies within it, fully reflects in your being and you get fully identified with it. God Almighty has similarly created many beautiful sights for you and this beauty of nature is spread all over. By getting into the source of that beauty that joy is created in you. You have incarnated to have the pleasure of the joy and not to make yourself miserable unnecessarily.

Now many people have asked that what they have to do further? Now you have to do something new; you have to watch only. When you go to see a movie and think as an audience that what you have to do. the answer that you get is you have to watch. Keep on watching. You have to see the transmigration the growth of trees and the chirping of the sparrows. You have to look at the auspicious and pure smile, you have to listen to the adulating voice of Divine blessings. You have, nothing else to do. Only by seeing it you will be overjoyed with it. Now you have to watch only. Nothing remains to be done. You have nothing to do for the health of your body, the way you have been doing so far: yoga etc. You need not do many yoga exercises (yoga asanas). It's all right if you do some light yoga exercises, but generally you have not to take much care of your body, because in it resides the God. You have to respect it. No excesses should be done with it.

If you want to get rid of alcohol or drugs, it's very easy. Whatever you decide about will happen. You will not get conditioned. If you have decided to get rid of alcohol you will be relieved of it. Human beings consume liquor because they do not want to face themselves. I am not asking to give up anything else but liquor because it damages your consciousness. By just watching you could get rid of drinking because now you have begun to love yourself. Automatically you will be in the state of joy. If by chance someone of you is imprisoned, you will say. 'Oh'! how nice! I will sit there and meditate. One is in one's own glory. There remains no urge for liquor or smoking cigarette. Nothing remains to be said, all the vices go away by themselves.

In Bombay, condition is such that one could not get match box for Sahaj Yogis. While going to centres you have to take it along to burn incense and to light a candle. No one smokes. The chain smokers, I don't know, how they have stopped smoking! Some people used to play rami (cards), they say, we have given up playing cards. They are enjoying their lives; they will enjoy themselves in the exams and also in the problems (mathematical). They will enjoy struggling with these problems (mathematical). They will enjoy struggling with these problems.

Now you have to take care that you do not have to struggle with things as you used to do. You are not your old self; you are a changed personality Now you have to see whether the other people are changing with us or not. You have to look to them. There is nothing to be afraid because you were also like them. Some people think themselves to be of high position. They are so much position conscious. Some think themselves to be very rich and others very religious. All are mad. Do not look to them. All the mad people in a lunatic asylum think themselves to be very wise. When you were in that mad house, you used to think similarly.

All these stupidities will go away slowly. Now you will realise the truth. Now you are blessed with that power-such a power because of which you will not be affected by your thoughts. For example, if one says to oneself. "I do not have to be angry, then ask yourself to be angry, stand before a mirror and ask yourself to be angry. You will start laughing. In the state of anger keep laughing from within. All the time you keep laughing, while in temper one gets involved with something or the other. All vices such as lust, anger, ego, envy etc have their own way. You have to look at it. It is a play. You should watch it. because now you are within, not without. That is what you have to do in Sahaj, you have to be within not without.

While talking to others be within, that is. in thoughtlessness. Whenever you have to talk to someone, get thoughtless first You will penetrate in them as soon as you gel into thoughtlessness first; their outlook will be changed and you are already a changed being. If you are not in thoughtlessness (within), then, maybe, that they pull you back. You could be pulled out because you have just gone within. For example, you have just come from the traffic and are made to sit on the mountain but you have got used to the traffic, so mentally you think yourself still to be in the traffic. You have to see, "Where am I standing?” You will know your state.

This is what Self-realisation is. The first thing is that you are in oneness with the beauty of the whole world. You know it is something new. unique and unbelievable. No one believes it but it's a fact. You yourself will realise that you are a witness. At home if someone falls III then everyone starts running, creating difficulties, may be just to show off, may be someone is really concerned. Nothing, absolutely no need to do anything You watch yourself and it will dawn upon you as to what action you have to take. Whatever you feel you should do. If you feel like putting your hand on the head, do it and if you feel like touching the foot, touch it. Whatever you are feeling, is for everyone, do it

Second aspect is the truth - that what should you tell, truth or untruth? What is truth and what is untruth? Most of the truth is manmade and man-made truth is not truth at all. Many-a-times something that appears untruth happens to be great truth. So, you do not have to decide about it. You just tell, tell in your thoughtlessness, talk to people about your state. Boldly you have to declare that this is alright, this the truth and it should be done There is nothing to be afraid of. May be, that people take it for untruth and they laugh at you. We went to Poona, there were some stupid people who published in the newspapers that "Shri Mataji was asking the seekers to move their hands. She was mesmerising them." One gentleman asked a question that, "Why should She mesmerise people? Has She nothing else to do?" They told that, “We cannot be mesmerised”. But you have got mesmerised Her way. Different type of people are there in the world, you cannot understand them.

Now you have got Chaitanaya in you, it is flowing in you, you have seen it, you need confirmation. But you have not attained magnificence and this is the difference between you and the great saints. The magnificence that you have attained recently is acute. It stands firmly and is not afraid to say that, that is the only truth, everything else is untruth and a myth.' This quality could be found in great people like Christ, Shri Krishna and other great saints. It could be found in Adi Shankaracharya. You read his books and you will get the confirmation. Now you read the scriptures afresh, read the Gita and Bible afresh and you will find that confirming truths are there. But you yourself are powerful enough, you do not need support and help of anyone else. The moment you start standing by your-self, in your glory, there is no need to feel shy about it or be afraid of anything.

But I find such people who hide themselves in their homes. It is said in the Bible that the lamp is not to be kept under the table. It-is to be put on some higher place. If you have really become lamps (the enlightened beings) then sit on a high pedestal and enlighten all others. You may belong to any religion. If you are a Sikh then see in their scriptures, everywhere, it is written. It's a truth which could be confirmed.

For your satisfaction the great saints have written it in all the scriptures, shlokas after shlokas, could be said about it and lines of Quran could also be quoted. They all confirm it. though they call it spiritual in English language, in Hindi it is called Adhyatmika and in Urdu, Roohani [spiritual connection]. There are different names but 'Truth is the One’. If you all know that aspect, then you also know that there could be no description of truth. What could be the description of an ocean? But every moment you will see the truth, that the truth is spread all over; with your vibrations you will know of it, with the vibrations you could understand it. Then you will see vibrations everywhere-in stones, in every-thing.

If four-five chakras of a person are caught then there is no need to argue with him Such persons are very difficult, beyond you. Immediately you will have no vibrations in your hands. A few days later, such a person will run from himself because of the hot vibrations. Have no connections with the persons who have hot vibrations. It is not an individual thought, it’s something spiritual. Here there is complete darkness. The tight between the light and darkness goes on forever. Now, so many lamps have been lit, the whole atmosphere could change if a few more lamps are enlightened. So, always keep your lamp lit, always weigh your vibrations, vibrations always flow from my photograph, they never stop. Stretch your hands towards my photograph whenever you feel burning sensations on any of your fingers. Everything has got a meaning.

You know this is Manipura Chakra, this is Vishuddhi, this is Agnya. This is Swadhisthana and this one is Mooladhara. And in the centre of your palm is the Sahasrara. It is round. If someone comes to you and tells that such and such person is unwell, please pray for him. You have nothing to do, clear the affected chakra of that person and he will be benefitted. Sitting here, with the movement of your fingers everything works out.

Your attention has become Divine. You could check it yourself. Even on your feet there, all the chakras are made. Man is a great creation of the Almighty. The God Almighty has made this instrument extremely beautiful. What is needed is its enlightenment. That part is also done, but still a lot remains. Now, you have to work it out sincerely and see, what it is? Because a small lamp has been lit, you are sitting with it. There is no need to sit. When you look within other people, then you will come to know what it is.

We have not thought of an organisation. In Bombay, there is an institution with the name of Eternal Life. There is no membership of it, only the realised people are its members. Many peoples get Realisation but then they go away. They come again and get it. There might be half-baked people amongst you also. I requested Mr. Bose, you make him chairman or do as you like to. I will stay with him. His bungalow No. is 10. you could take his telephone number also. I will send photograph etc. to him. However, he is very busy person, go to him at the fixed time. Friday is appropriate. Fix that day for your weekly meditation. With attention, I will see all of you.

You might have heard about the symbol of God like Shri Ganesha. His carriage is mouse. Now your attentions are your carriages. Your power resides in your attention, where ever your attention goes it works out. It is so wonderful. Sitting here you can exercise your power and improve everything. Everyone, you see is torturing someone or the other. Bring them on Sahasrara and set them right. On Brahmarandhra, you will be amazed, their condition has improved. There are wicked people, Dushasanas, there are saints and above all of them, we, Sahaja Yogis, are here. Give them discretion. With the power of love people get changed because love is more powerful than hatred. Like ocean, the power of love is fathomless. As there is no end to the expanse of the sea, there is no end of the ocean of love, it rises more than hatred. If its power is lesser than the power of hatred then this world will be destroyed.

You have not still understood your responsibilities. You could not realise that this is the New Age, there are new people and new dimensions. You could understand this dimension with your vibrations. The singer Siddheswari Bai who was just singing here; yesterday her condition was very bad. With great reluctance she came to me and said, "I have to undergo such and such operation, this that." I just put my hand on her head and today she has started singing! You all could do this work, there is nothing which I have not told you.

Now only a curtain remains within us. If you learn to tear out this curtain, then everything could be done. But to tear out this curtain becomes difficult. However, you are realised now. So, first we have to remove this curtain because this is a stupendous work.

The greatest thing in it is love. With love we have to identity ourselves. While talking to someone we have to decide first that we have to love. It is all love; you cannot change it. As people tell me, you see, everyone is giving Realisation. In America, there is difficulty with the people that they could misuse it. I said, "How could they misuse it? They could only give Realisation; they could cure someone with it". With love you cannot harm anyone. Think yourself, if you love someone how could you harm him? The quality of love is this that one who loves cannot think of harming the object of love.

Whatever is benevolent will take place. The only thing you have to do is to respect yourself. When you begin to respect yourselves, you get established within because it is a temple: the more you respect il the more Divine Light is there in it. With love you could get identified with It, only with love you could be one with it, in complete harmony. Only pure love could emanate from you. The one which is Chaitanya is the Truth and the Beauty. You sit in thoughtless awareness and you will be one with it.

Thoughtlessness comes only when you cross this point (Agnya). You have crossed il and now you are in thoughtless awareness. Your brain used to think. Now your Sahasrara is pierced and you are above your brain. When this point is reached, you could check it with your hand. Those who are Realized, should check at this point ‘Ardha Bindu’ and they will feel it, but those who are not, will not feel. Are you feeling it? Slowly, feel it, take your hands slightly up-down. That is the place of the 'Ardha Bindu'. And above it, is ’Bindu' and 'Valaya' is above all.

All that was made to create this world, has also been within human beings. First 'Valaya’, then 'Bindu', after that 'Ardha Bindu', and then this Sahasrara, then this whole kundalini was created. The Adi Kundalini itself penetrated in you and became your Kundalini. Some people (Deities) were placed to establish the Adi Kundalini. In the beginning, it was necessary to establish someone. Shri Ganesha was established first of all. Adi Shakti put Shri Ganesha only on one chakra. One Ganesha on the chakra.

What is Shri Ganesha? He is purity personified. Think of it. Suppose you have not taken bath for a few days and the body is not clean. But the vibrations clean the impurities. Shri Ganesha is nothing but vibrations and purity because he is the Eternal Child. Eternal Child, and it is difficult to find one like Him in the world. His whole love is purity and purity only and because of that purity he has been placed on your Mooladhara chakra. On Mooladhara is the Mother. Its clear meaning is that in sex matters, you have to be like children. I mean that when the dharma is established in you. you become childlike, innocent in sex matters.

It is difficult to attain the heights of Shri Ganesha because he is a very pure soul. His radiance is spreading all around. To penetrate within, we have to be very pure otherwise no one else could be there except Shri Ganesha and His Mother.

In the process of creation, Brahmadeva was made the deity of the second chakra. But before Him, Shri Vishnu was created so that there is a Sustainer for this Divine creation. That is the reason that we take birth from the Nabhi chakra of our Mother. And then there is the creation of fatherly Father. From the Nabhi, Brahmadeva was created. That’s how it was done, the way someone is placed at some particular point. There is no untruth in it. You yourself could verify it.

Now this Void was created. It was all created, major nerves and pelvic plexus and around it the Void. And in it was the emanating love for the creation. The whole creation got caught in this love. This love is the All-pervading Power, in it is the creation.

Now it is essential to cross this Void. But as I have told you earlier, the God and his Power is present in our heart as our soul. So, as the child is born- not born, as soon as he is conceived in the womb of the mother, the witness state God Almighty comes in his Heart and looks like a flame, the way this thumb is. This soul is in the left heart.

Many people get confused about it. They think soul is in the heart chakra, it is not in the heart chakra it is in the heart. The soul resides in this plain. Why does He not reside in the Heart Chakra? Because it is the path of Kundalini to ascend. It is in the central heart and the soul resides in the left heart.

In the word 'Rama', 'Ra‘means energy and ‘m' means Mahesh, that is Shri Shiva. Mahesh is Shiva as the God who resides in our heart. When 'Ra‘ is united with 'm' it becomes Ram. To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasagara) He has to make some arrangement. So, the great power like Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh was created and they were placed in the area of dharma. Dattatreya and the Adi Gurus incarnated in this world many a time. He incarnated as king Janaka who was like the father of the Adi shakli. After that, He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Machindranath, then as Mohammad Saheb and Nanak Sahib. No one fought with each other. See what type of darkness you are in? Fatima, the daughter of Mohammad Sahib was the same who became daughter of king Janaka. Whom are you fighting? Think over it. The Nanaki of Guru Nanaka was no one else but Janaki. Shirdi Sai Nath was also an Adi Guru. They are the masters of all. Also, they are my Gurus. These Adi Gurus taught me all this knowledge. In different incarnations, they kept teaching me.

Ultimately, I had to come and do this work. They could not do it and now they are placing me as a Guru so that I take up the job of a Guru. There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru. But in Kali Yuga, only a Mother could do this work; it is beyond the power of men. This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being, they will break down. So, love is the only way out.

So, this Gurudom was given to me. Everything is acceptable to me. But I didn't know the qualities of a Guru. Gurus maintain distance but Mother does not keep distance with the children. Children sit on her head. So, you people also could take liberty with me and enjoy. Be with me with full freedom, you will neither be afraid nor be embarrassed. There is no problem, you could come and talk to me boldly about your problems. You could complain to me as you do to your mother. I am freely available to you, freedom was needed. Religion was required to be discussed openly, there is no secret, no secret about it.

Ultimately, everything has to be explained very clearly. All the secrets are to be told. Everything could not be said everywhere. I am telling all this to you people who are Realised ones, because non-realised will doubt it. It has some meaning only for the Realised ones. You could attain much higher state than this.

Lot of work was done to cross the Void, some success was achieved and if you people could get it, they are helpful today. They become eternal, the founder of Jaina Dhama. Shri Mahavira and Shri Buddha are amongst them. They were born of the same Mother, born of the womb of Adi Shakti. Try to know their first relation that where were they born. But it was experimental for all of them. All of them made experiments so that human beings could cross the Void. Very few, however, could cross the Void. But en-masse Realisation could be done only in Kali Yuga.

After that, Shri Rama incarnated in this world but he forgot that he was an incarnation. He remained in this world as a human being, not as an incarnation so that you could rise above the Bhavasagara. He was a perfect human being. During his incarnation a few seekers could get their Realisation, there is no doubt about it. But en-mass Realisation could not be given.

Six or seven thousand years ago, Shri Krishna incarnated on this earth. Right from the beginning of this creation, all the seekers wished to cross the Bhavasagara. The poor seekers had to face lot of problems. While meditating, they were tortured. So, the Adi Shakti incarnated on this earth 108 times in her perfect form. You might have read about it. Read Devi Mahatmaya and you will know what I am saying. The Adi Shakti incarnated in the form of the Devi and recognized the seekers. At that time, She came in the clear form of the Devi. There was no Maya around Her. So, seekers could not get their Self-realisation form Her. The only thing they got was her protection. She killed Mahishasura, Shumbha and Nishumbha and many others. All the rakshasas and negative people who used to torture the saints were killed. But none of them got salvation because they were not perfect human beings. They could see only four chakras, that is up to the heart plexus.

So, Shri Radha incarnated after Shri Sita. She was placed on the fifth chakra, that is the Vishuddhi. She is very humane and She sang the song of love. It is said that at the time of killing the Kansa, the maternal uncle (Kamsa) of Shri Krishna. Shri Radha was called. Radha - ’Ra' means energy and 'dha' means the sustainer. The stream of Shri Radha starts flowing in you. Shaivite people are the followers of Shri Shiva. They do not believe in Shri Krishna.

There is no difference between Shri Krishna and Shri Shiva. Shiva is placed in your heart as soul and Shri Krishna is on the Vishuddhi. Shri Krishna has sixteen powers. Similarly, you have got sixteen plexuses. It is surprising that Shri Krishna is the deity of Vishuddhi chakra which has sixteen petals. His power Radha was then divided into two. that is, Rukmini in Dwarika and Radha in Vrindavan; it is very humanly.

Shri Krishna had only one son who was Pranava (Divine power) incarnated. Think of it. He was 'Om' incarnated. He incarnated on this earth. His name was Jesus Christ. Mary was his mother. He was placed on the Agnya Chakra. On Agnya one has to face ego and superego. You see your Agnya Chakra controls your pineal and pituitary bodies; it is scientifically proved. So, he pushes away the evil spirits from your Agnya because these spirits sit on the superego. They could sit in ego also because Ida and Pingala nadis cross each other on Agnya Chakra. So, Shri Jesus put his hand on this plexus first of all. It was done at the time of Nanaka Sahib.

In all ages, these ghostly powers came to do encroachment. But Shri Krishna has such a destructive power that He cut their throats. So; on Agnya Chakra is the name of Shri Jesus. Shri Mahalakshmi, whose praise we sing so frequently, no one has described Her. Where is She placed? She is Mary Herself. Whenever She incarnates with her child and husband, She is very peaceful. But when she comes alone, then She is tremendous. So, this plexus belongs to Bhagawati. The plexus of Sahasrara belongs to Bhagawati. She Herself pierces it, all the seven chakras are there in it. Therefore, the Maya (illusion) also has seven layers. It is very difficult to recognise Her. Seven human chakras get completed here.

In nut shell, I have told you what you have to do, how you have to complete your seeking. But if we talk about it methodically then we could say that there is no particular time for it. All the times we could be in the state of thoughtless awareness. For example, you are sitting in a thoughtless state, start thinking, then go into thoughtlessness.

After there is thoughtless awareness and then comes the doubtless awareness. You will have doubts but in the second stage you get the doubtless awareness. Doubts will be there: is right or not? What Shri Mataji has said is not right? How could it be? Has it happened or not? Have we got Realisation or not? This sort of doubts will come. How will these doubts be eradicated? When you have been given a seat, I mean when you are seated on the throne and you have doubts as to whether it is a throne where I am sitting? Is it all right or not? You could check it by your own hands, that now an unparalleled energy is flowing from your hands. When you will cure people by touching them with your hands, when you will have such experiences then slowly and slowly your doubts will vanish. I mean that I have prepared a boat for you, now you have to launch it in the water, fight with the waves, only then you will come to know whether it is a boat or not. Maybe it is some wood only. The boat has been built or not could be tested by launching it into water and by rowing it on the waves. If it withstands the pressure of the waves then you will be sure of it. Otherwise, doubts will remain.

In the same way you have to test your Realisation because man thinks no end of himself. One person out of our seekers went somewhere, a swamiji was sitting with a boasted flag. Many people came there, had their food etc. This gentleman went to America with us, with the movement of his hand he used to do things. You could also do it. With the movement of your hands, you could raise the kundalini of someone. Siting here you move your hands and see how nice it is that the kundalini of the other person will move with your fingers. The energy which is flowing from your hands will do it. So, this way that sadhu used to pretend to awaken the kundalini of hundreds of Americans. Since many people were going to him. one of our Sahaja Yogi also went to him. I come to know of everything as to who is hanging about and where. When he returned, he was miserable. I asked, "Why did you touch his feet?" He said that, “Since everyone was touching his feet, I also touched”. I said, “You have to touch the feet of only those who are older to you”. I asked him what was his condition, what was the condition of his kundalini, is he Realised? He replied, "No, he is not Realised." His kundalini is overturned. I asked him, “You raise the kundalini of thousands of seekers with the movements of your fingers. Why could you not think that you should not have touched his feet?" His kundalini is overturned; at least he should have been a Realised person to touch his feet. One should touch the feet of one who is higher than yourself. Otherwise, why to touch the feet at all? You know everything. You know the reason of it. You have the complete knowledge of it. You are so expert in it. why did you touch his feet?

You become egoless. You all live in such an unassuming way that no one could believe that you are Realized. One becomes egoless. Completely egoless. He feels, how it has happened, how that has happened? But it has happened. If this transformation has taken place in you. then you should think, "Why has this transformation taken place in you only?" Many people live in Delhi. Why we have specially been given Realization? There might be some reason. You might have been seeking for many lives. It is your right. You are saints, saints of high orders. You are not aware of this fact. If you were not saints, how could I give Realization to you? Can I give Realization to stones? Thousands of people come but I cannot give Realization to all of them. Only a few of you have got it. Definitely, there is some reason for it.

But you cannot believe it. You think, how could it be? This problem comes because of you are egoless. In a very ordinary way; you neither change the style of your clothes nor any other showing-off. But you will see that you have become peaceful within. You are now altogether different being. The style of your talking and doing things is of a Realized one. And you will become expert. You know about others that such and such chakra of this person is catching, that is why he is behaving abnormally. Let me set it right. And within a little time, that person is cooled down. Some people come to quarrel with me, but Sahaja Yogis calm them down by moving their Kundalini. They play many tricks and within a little time, such people sit quietly.

One fellow came and started quarrelling. It was the time for him to take some sesamum. They put the sesamum on their hand and vibrated them. As soon as he ate those sesamum, immediately he went into meditation.

If someone is disturbing you too much then put your finger in the water and make him drink that vibrated water. The work will be done. Chaitanya will awaken within that person. But still, you are newly born children. Small child gets ill very soon, similarly you also catch very soon You have to stick to your position otherwise you will descend very soon. Don’t leave your position, do not be shaken. Stick to your place because the boon given to you is such that one could be unsteady. I am telling it to you. Therefore, power of collectivity should be there.

There are people amongst you who come and tell, “Shri Mataji my head is catching". Collectively you could clear the catches, whether it is in your waist, Agnya Chakra or anywhere else, you could clear it yourself. Now these Sahaja Yogis are your brothers and sisters. This is the new world of love. These are your relatives. You know them. At the time of difficulty, you will be surprised that they will run to help you. Because Deities are there with you for your protection. Suddenly if you think about someone, immediately you find him before you and saying, "I don’t know how I came here! I was going this way, I thought to come up to you". All your works are done, you will not meet with accidents. Deities are hovering over you. If one Sahaja Yogi is there at the place of accident, then all others are also saved because of him. Many things will happen. You keep on watching and recording. Watch the awakening and movements of your Kundalini. There is going to be no problem in it. Sometimes it will titillate here and move there; sometimes it will enlighten here and sometimes there. Your consciousness, which is connected to all these things, will get enlightened and it will enlighten the whole world.

Now you are sitting here, but you are not aware that thousands and millions of rays are emanating from you. You will see that the whole atmosphere of Delhi will change; you will see it. I went to Calcutta only once. Have you seen the atmosphere there? I said it there itself that the atmosphere of Calcutta will change. I stayed there for eight days and the whole atmosphere changed, the minds of people were calmed down.

Today, in Maharashtra it is going on very well. The reason is that many people have got their Realisation. Now it is the turn of Delhi State. The Kundalini of the whole world is situated in India. How tremendous! The seat of Kundalini of the whole world is in India. If our India improves, then whole world will improve. The Sahasrara of the whole world is here. So, I need thousands and thousands of Indians who could give Realisation to others.

May God Bless you.
