In the Devi Mahatmya, you must have read that-Gregoire: I will translate in French if you want.Shri Mataji: Yes.It is said that all the best things are made for bad, evil people, and that’s how all your Switzerland was utilized by all kinds of cults and horrible gurus who came here and settled down. And people helped them when they came here because they had money. But, luckily, all our struggle against them and the fight against them is making them fall down now, one by one. And so many are saved from them. So, all the beautiful places, all the beauty that God has created is made for sages, for the Yogis and not for these horrible, evil people. And also, not for the rich who waste their life in irreligious life. And also, not for the so-called religious who deceive God and make money out of it. It is meant or created for the people who are genuine, who are real, who are God’s dear ones, who are blessed.

In the Bible there is quite a lot of quoting about blessed are those- I would say, blessed are those who are Sahaja Yogis.

Sahaja Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: Because they are the only ones who are capable of becoming the real masters, who can raise the Kundalini and make people meet the Divine. They do it free, absolutely, selflessly because they enjoy it. They enjoy everything, that’s their reward. So now, on this mountain where we are, it’s such a pure atmosphere, we have to make a very genuine promise that this havan that is going on here is the power of the Nabhi which is the "swaha" which completely consumes all that is evil, digests it and uses whatever is good for the nourishment. In the same way, we have to promise that we will be consuming all that is evil in a way to destroy it and we will digest and nourish ourselves with the divine knowledge.Gregoire: I would like to say it in another language because this is a promise.Shri Mataji: Ha.And let this havan also completely use tis power of "swaha" for Switzerland and for the whole world.

As you know, the Devi is called as Shailaputri, meaning "born on the peak." And the tip of the Sahasrara is also called as "shikara" [top], means the- "shaila" [mountain] means the – what you call the epitome of the peak.

So, we are here today to celebrate on top of the Sahasrara of Switzerland. But it’s only possible when we have crossed the brain. And brain-crossing is only possible when you have the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga. You must know about Sahaja Yoga. People know how to raise the Kundalini but you have to read, you have to understand it in every aspect of Sahaja Yoga. So, this joy will be complete. Because when you read about it, you will be surprised that you already know all this.[Laughter]

And that, you will be surprised that your mind will discover many more things for discretion, for talking to people, how to bring them round to the right path. So, one has to know about it, the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, the- in words, so that you can speak to people. There are many who have got "Advent" with them just like a Bible, but nobody hasn’t, so many have not read it.[Laughter]There is no Rock of Gibraltar anymore there, it’s on the back of it, that you need no read.[Laughter]That’s a fact, what can I do?[Laughter]He didn’t translate Me properly.[Laughter]Gregoire: I gave the meanings.[Applause. Laughter]

They told Me, in America, that my photographs where I am happy and laughing, one should not give, should give a very serious face.[Laughter]Because this horrible guru here, he is called the "Gigli guru" [Narakasura] and because he laughs, but you can see he is sinister, there’s no truth in it.

So, now we have to start our havan. With all sincerity, let us do it.Hundred and eight names.Sahaja Yogi: Of, of Mataji?Shri Mataji: Hundred and eight names. That we must be having.So, may God bless you.
