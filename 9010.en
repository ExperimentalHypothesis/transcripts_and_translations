Havan, Weggis (Switzerland), October 20th, 1985

What a beautiful place, eh? You don't have something like this in London or in England. Beautiful! I wonder if you have any cable cars. Will we have in England any able cars?

Yogis: Scotland, in Scotland.

Shri Mataji: We have? Hello, how are you? Something like Bogota, so far. Best place for a honeymoon. Best place to come for a honeymoon. Beautiful.

Yogi: Relax a little bit. I know.

Gregoire: It's working now.

Shri Mataji: Is that our, our tent?

Gregoire: This is our... Shri Mataji: Our tent?

Shri Mataji: What a place to come to. Olympia, what a beautiful place, eh?

Aren't you enjoying? Have you been here before?

Girl: No.

Shri Mataji: Not, have you been? Ah. Many of you might have come for the first time even.

Gregoire: I was here, but I didn't know I would come back with you. Shri Mataji: With Me.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, you did everything, because the people in the hotel, they give us the [inaudible].

They give us the plates, they give us the ghee.

Shri Mataji: Really?! They are very nice people here. Germans are so nice, huh. They are becoming nice people.

[A yogi offering Shri Mataji help walking]

I can manage, I can manage. I'm all right on the mountains.

Gregoire: In Marathi?

Shri Mataji: In Marathi.

Gregoire: Sha...sha...

Shri Mataji: Yes Shaila, Shailavati. Shaila is the peak, peak of the mountain.

Born on the peak. Thank you, such a... Oh, Shri Ganesha is here!

Guido: This is a present for you, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: What a beauty. There cannot be more beautiful than this. Oh, what an idea. Thank you, I will be sitting. What a place, eh? In the Devi Mahatma you must have read that...

Gregoire: I will translate in French if you want?

Shri Mataji: Yes. It is said that all the best things are meant for bad, evil people. And that's how all your Switzerland was utilized by all kinds of cults and horrible gurus who came here and settled down. And people helped them when they came here because they had money. But luckily, all our struggle against them and the fight against them, and the fight against them is making them fall down now, one by one, and so many are saved from them.

So all the beautiful places, all the beauty that God has created is meant for sages. For the yogis. And not for these horrible, evil people. And also not for the rich who waste their life in irreligious life. And also not for the so-called religious who deceive God and make money out of it. It is meant or created for the people who are genuine,who are real, who are God's dear ones, who are blessed.

In the Bible there is quite a lot of quoting about blessed are those, I would say blessed are those who are Sahaja Yogis. Because they are the only ones who are capable of becoming the real masters who can raise the Kundalini and make people meet the Divine. They do it free, absolutely, selflessly, because they enjoy it. They enjoy everything, that's their reward.

So now on this mountain where we are, is such a pure atmosphere, we have to make a very genuine promise. That this havan that is going on here is the power of the Nabhi which is the swaha. Which completely consumes all that is evil, digests it and uses whatever is good for nourishment. In the same way we have to promise that we will be consuming all that is evil in a way to destroy it and we will digest and nourish ourselves with the Divine knowledge.

Gregoire: I would like to say it in another language because it is a promise.

Shri Mataji: And let this havan also, completely use its power as swaha for Switzerland and for the whole world. As you know the Devi is called as Shaila Putri, meaning born on the peak. And the tip of the Sahasrara is also called as shikara, means the shaila, means the, what do you call it, the epitome, the epitome of the peak. So we are here today to celebrate on top of this Sahasrara of Switzerland. But that's only possible when we have crossed the brain and brain crossing is only possible when you have the knowledge about Sahaja Yoga. You must know about Sahaja Yoga, people know how to raise the Kundalini. But... You have to read, you have to understand it in every aspect of Sahaja Yoga. So this joy will be complete. Because when you read about it, you will be surprised that you already know all this.

[Laughter]

And that you will be surprised that your mind will discover many more things. For discretion, for talking to people how to bring them round to the right path. So one has to know about it, the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, the inverts, so that you can speak to people. There are many who have got Advent [Gregoire's book] with them just like a Bible but nobody has, so many have not read it.

[Laughter]

There is no rock of Gibraltar anymore there, it's on in the back of it that you need not read.

[Laughter]

That's a fact, what can I do?

[Laughter]

He didn't translate Me properly.

[Laughter]

Gregoire: I give the meaning.

[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: They told me in America that my photographs where I am happy and laughing one should not give, should give a very serious face.

[Laughter]

Because this horrible Guru here is called the 'Giggly Guru' [Narakasura] and because he laughs but you can see he is sinister, there is no truth in him. So now we have to start our Havan with all sincerity, let us do it. 108 names, are we not? 108 names. Our 108 names. That we must be having. So may God bless you. Good. The horrible thing is... All right. So all those who sat for the puja should come forward here.

Gregoire: I always find this lady on the first row.

Shri Mataji: What?

Gregoire: I always find these two ladies on the first row. They are following my bad example, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: I think you remove everything from there, all that could be removed, there is no need here, when we need it we will get it from here, all right? Ah. That's better. Some put it here up to this point, some people can come up to this point like that. This is the point up to this point, move it, move on. Just move forward, those who have not done puja before. Still move, like that you can move further, here. Yes, yes move it, move it on. Yes, move it on. Yes, yes. Now let them have this, all of this, can you sit all right, you can come here, I mean there can be one row like that, yes, yes.

Now you pass it on to everyone, take it, you have to keep it in your hand, quite a lot. There are no categories, no? They must not have bought some. To hold in the thing but there are no leaves otherwise you can take these maple leaves, are all right? Take these maple leaves, yes, good idea, in any case they are going to fall down. You can have some from there if you like. [Inaudible], can you get some big maple leaves from there please? Leaves, on the leaves they can keep it, keep it on the leaves, yes. Yes, it's better. Get some more leaves, possibly. Thomas be careful, I hope it doesn't fall down on him just like. Gavin, come along, come here. You can remove this I think, yes. Automa. Just, yeah yeah let her come, these peaches are [inaudible].

Or she can come this way, yes, yeah, yeah. Just sit on the sides, Gavin, like that, because you are not going to do anything, so you could face me now. You come this side, you come this side, let us sit that side. Ha? Let her sit here.

Gregoire: If Gavin can read it loud enough, then he should do it.

Shri Mataji: No, no, he should be here and read it loud. You give her the asana, I think she has no asana to sit down, for Anita. Take this, please. It's all right. Leaves, on the leaves, pass it on more to everyone.

Gregoire: Can you pass on the leaves?

Shri Mataji: Give some to Anita also. Yes, Thank you. No. that's all. So you look after that side, ha? All right. Now where is the camphor, have you got camphor? All right. So now you can use a candle to light it, I think, use the candle, so let's start it, Gavin.

Gavin: Shri Ganesha's mantra.

Shri Mataji: These are the seven essences he has described, seven essences of the centers, the chakras.

Gavin: Now for lighting the fire, we take the mantra of Shri Agni Devata.

Shri Mataji: Let it twirl. Loudly. Because everybody should hear

Gavin: Now we will say the mantras.

Yogi: Can't hear.

Gavin: In each mantra we will say, Om Shri Mata, or whatever name it is, namo namah and then Om...

Shri Mataji: Can you all hear him? Stand up. Therefore you say.

Gregoire: Because his voice is not loud enough.

Shri Mataji: Not a loud speaker, yes.

Gregoire: He has so many beautiful qualities but...

[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: All right.

Gregoire: So I will just... So that my voice does not get cut.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, you are all right. You have to say, doing God's work.

Gregoire: So I'm going to say the name first. And then we say, Om Tvameva Sakshat Shri, the name, Swaha. Is that correct? So the first name is the one that we all have in our heart.

And this is Shri Mata. When we say Om Swaha we take this handful of rice around our head and we offer it to the fire.

Shri Mataji: All of you should do it also.

Gregoire: We all do it even if we don't have rice in our hand. And the rhythm is to be a bit more lively.

Shri Mataji: What is this first name? [inaudible]. Correct.

Gregoire: Bhavani. Nitya. Vishnu-granthi vibhedini Bhakti Priya.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you all. May God bless you all. It's beautiful. Tremendous vibrations. Your heads are all covered with that. Well done. So again we thank all the Swiss Sahaja Yogis for organising this beautiful trip. And the greatest thanks are for organising this Havana here. This is a mutual thanking, I think. From their side I thank you and from your side I thank them. So now how much time do we have?

Gregoire: Would you like, Shri Mataji, we can say, fake gurus, om swaha, this kind of thing, or it's not necessary.

Shri Mataji: We have to just say the, now the badhas. Badhas we have to do, that's all.

Gregoire: So, what we are going now, we are going to carry on a little bit with the badhas, you know, and...

Shri Mataji: This is the fruit of this place, is it?

Yogi: Yes, it is.

Shri Mataji: We have to take it out to put it, it's very nice.

Gregoire: And then we will finish definitely.

Shri Mataji: Treat with the badhas, it's better. Now let us start the badhas.

Gregoire: You organise that. The...

Shri Mataji: You organise the badhas?

Gregoire: No, no, no. We organise them here. The badhas of lukewarm heart. The badhas of hypocrisy.

Shri Mataji: What is that? Badhas of?

Gregoire: Hypocrisy.

Shri Mataji: Oh hypocrisy.

Gregoire: The badhas of established so-called religions. The badhas of cults. The badhas of the fake gurus. The badhas of all the sects.

Shri Mataji: Badhas against Sahaja Yoga.

Gregoire: The badhas against Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Now you put up the centers of the countries.

Shri Mataji: Badhas of what you call, tradition.

Gregoire: Badhas of conditioning and wrong tradition. Badhas of our E.G.O.

Shri Mataji: After that nothing is to be said.

[Laugther]

Gregoire: Shri Mataji said after this one nothing is to be said.

Shri Mataji: Once that is over everything is over. It's like a disease, you know. Like a funny disease. And I have categorised them. I must tell you. The one is that people become like matcaps with that. Some become stupid.

Gregoire: Matcaps, how do you say in French?

Shri Mataji: They are all matcaps. What do they say?

Gregoire: They work with the hat, we say in French. They work with the hat to say they are matcaps. Yes.

Shri Mataji: We should say something in English like this. Talking through their hats.

Gregoire: Yes.

Shri Mataji: They talk through their hats. Yes, yes, working through. Or then they are on the superego side, they are idiotic. Idiotic. And they on one side they are extremely cruel. On the other side they are very sly. So all these badas should be burnt out. If any badas are left out.

Gregoire: All the badas that we may have forgotten.

Shri Mataji: Thank you. We all enjoyed it thoroughly. Now seeing from all over sides this mist has spread but we are safe here. It has not reached us. What time do we have to leave from here?

Gregoire: Shri Mataji it's, its, we have to be done?

Yogi: At One we have to be done.

Gregoire: And when is the cabin leaving? Any? When is the cabin leaving?

Yogi: Well every quarter of a hour.

Shri Mataji: I think we should start moving in anything.

Gregoire: There is a point where you have a beautiful view Shri Mataji which you wouldn't like to?

Shri Mataji: No let them go and see the point. We can go down. And then lunch here we will have it there.

Gregoire:  No, lunch there is nothing organised, Shri Mataji. Because the program is topped with breakfast so people will have to look for themselves.

Shri Mataji: So what we can do is go to the airport. We can get some lunch all of us can have it. Those who are coming to the airport.

Gregoire: Yes. One second [UNCLEAR]. Because Shri Mataji will now go down. Those who we still have quite some time and if you go up here there is a beautiful point where you have the view over the whole thing. So you can perhaps stay half an hour or so around and then Arno is going to tell you how it goes further.

Shri Mataji: Because you see in one thing you cannot go you have to take one after another and so some must start going down. Those who have seen it.

Gregoire: Those who are in a hurry go first because we cannot all go it will take some time before we all can go down. So you can look around if you just go up here it is quite nice. And then we will go down. Those who go to England then we can have eventually some kind of... late lunch in the airport in Zurich. The British flight is at four o'clock. The bus is leaving at one. So, well I mean people will wait but let's try to be all down there by one one fifteen.

Shri Mataji: You want to come to me? All right, all right come along. Yes, come along. You want to come to Me?

Gregoire: Where is the ticket of Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji, you have your ticket? Your plane ticket?

Shri Mataji: Yes, I have, I have. I have I'll...

Gavin: We have little presents for new Sahaja Yogis. New Sahaja Yogis.

Shri Mataji: There are a few things we have to distribute before we go. So about 5, 10 minutes more.

Gavin: For those who have been less than one year.

Shri Mataji: She likes to be alone. Now, just bring the photographs, photographs you have got of mine. The photographs of Shri Ganesh and the tapes. There are tapes there.

Gregoire: They are already distributed Shri Mataji. They were distributed already. The Ganeshas.

Shri Mataji: All right. Now this we have got very beautiful music. I have not yet translated it but I will translate made by Nasik Sahaja Yogis. If you want you can play if you have a tape recorder. Start it, I may be able to tell you. Now this one is for... one we have given to whom did we give to Holland. Now this is for Switzerland.

Everyone: Bolivia!

Yogi: Yes, yes very good.

Shri Mataji: You are all right?

Yogi: Yes thank you very much.

Shri Mataji: I am happy. So that's how you must hear this. But the only problem is that we can't hear it. It is very, very silent meditation I think. So what should we do? We can't hear it.

Yogini: We took it already Shri Mataji. We took the passport out already Shri Mataji.

Gregoire: Maybe Shri Mataji you cannot just... While we are all gathered here there are some of us who are plotting to try to... We don't know whether it will work out because it does not depend on us.We are trying perhaps to have a program, in Athens to have a Sahasrara Day in Delphi.
