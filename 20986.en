Nirmala Vidya - 1986-1222 Music Program

Comment 1 Nasik

There was a very great saint, poet and a realized soul called Namdev. He was a tailor. But in the Kingdom of God, he was a prince. He met another prince Who was a potter and his name was ‘ bora kumhar’. ‘Kumhar’ means the potter.  So how they recognized each other What love they felt for each other. They were from 2 different places. In the same way when the Sahaj yogi’s meet each other from any places Whatsoever they just fell that love, that oneness, that goodness, that belonging. As they were the great poet, they described it that I came to see here the formless God, but here I see him in a form. ‘Nirguna’ is a formless and the ‘Saguna’ is a form. It is beautifully good Everything so well! Very touching And gives me a great hope that whether you are from India or from England or from America or from any other country you are all born of one mother and you are a realized soul of very high degree. The sign of a very good high soul is that he recognizes the divinity in another person and enjoys that worships it and love it ...Same way Shri Nanka met with Guru Nanak ...He went Punjab. And his poems are written by Shri Nanka in his great book called Granth Sahib. So how he respected this gentleman from Maharashtra, & he was in Punjab ...So the distance does not matter...What matters is the oneness in your spirit. That time there was no mother to tell them, no one to guide them. They were all alone in different places. Whenever they had a chance to meet...They would travel miles together to see each other and enjoy each other's company...I see that vision now among you all ...so Thank you very much!

So very beautiful song I wish you had known the Marathi language. This is not easy to translate the whole thing.

And Let me have the ‘yog’...that’s called in the ‘alokya’ language or the rustic language as ‘Jogwa’...’Yo’  is said as ‘Jo’ ...Like as we have ‘yeshu ‘ and ‘Jesu‘...in the same way

Comment 3

There is a song written by another poet named Eknath. Great Poets we have, great saints ...and Poets ...And this song is so subtle and so beautifully bended with a rustic life that in every village they sing this song ...I wonder how many really understand the subtleties. This thing that I will ask for the yoga from my Mother. But throughout What she says is that I will give up all these attachments  I have, I will give up my false pride, I will give up my ego, in a way as if you give up all the funny relationships, and funny ideas of relations. And I will become absolutely without attachments ...and then you gave me my 'yog'.They are asking the Mother. But also ...it  also states that I will then collect all the flowers in my 'Bodh' and you know the meaning of 'Bodh' is what you feel on your central nervous system, all the experiences on my central nervous system I will collect them as flowers in my flower container, and I will leave it to you ...There is a very very subtle song, I don't know it, I mean I never hear it intensely as I did it today. And then it says that I will cross this ocean of illusion, pass through the tunnel and this is the Brahma Nadi through the tunnel and the end of it Because the ‘Eknath’  was a very great poet and great realized soul ...He said these things in a very local language ...I should say in a very rustic language ...And in all the villages they sing this song ...So basically the roots are there, People are not [unclear] ...This is what it is. In this country, especially in Maharashtra, It is no difficult to talk to them about Kundalini, about anything. ] It's gone into their blood . And, surprisingly, it is just a [unclear /foreclose ]. Such a subtle one ...

Because you will take about 1+1/2 hour to reach the river where you all are going to be stationed very well...Near ...The beautiful river which is known as ’Pravara’ And they say that you should take a bath in the river Ganges  You should drink the water of the river ‘Pravara'...And you will be stationed there in beautiful surrounding but you would like to have a bath also. So the sooner you leave, the more time you have for the bath.

If you reach at 11 ...you have 3 hours if you reach at 12 you have two hours, So it is for you to choose! Can take your time.[unclear] ....

(Sahaja yogi name ) is saying that the food will be ready at 2 o'clock. So you organize in such a way it's a 1+1/2 hours journey and 2 hours[unclear ] of a bath ...So whatever time you think proper, you better leave and have a nice time there ...I may be there, I may not be there I can't say & after that, we have to go for the public program in the evening So you can dress there ...It's a beautiful garden they say & the next day we have to go to Rahuri ... Pune I am sorry ...So that's how it's going to be ...Moreover in this juncture, I would like to thank great Musicians for sitting here ...Mr  Savankar has been such a great ascent to Sahaja Yoga ...He had brought beautiful melodies, beautiful songs of great devotion and dedication ...ans such played the rhythms that you all are enjoying it so much ...I hope to invite him to London or to other western countries and to America ...(clapping of yogis ).

This is the same joy that one feels for a SahajaYogi. As you all are Sahaja yogis and he is also a Sahaja yogi, this joy is so much mutual ...I thank all his party and all the other people who are here & his brother who is singing so well & all the ladies who have  so melodious voices ...[unclear- voice distortion]

Whatever it is you must be very grateful to God, for bringing us together in this manner, in singing the praise of the lord in such surrendered moods. It is a very rare sight for me ... a very rare sight and I really enjoyed it thoroughly...I am especially thankful to Dr Sanghvey, her and his family and the family of Dr Sahib ...All the others who have helped him to make this music so successful...From all the Sahaja yogis I would like to thank them very much for making this spontaneous stay ...So successful ...

Last but not the least I thank all of you ! for [unclear/welcoming] lots of inconveniences in this country of ours ...Where it is very comfortable for the spirit but not so comfortable for the body!  I hope the rest of the journey would be better, more comfortable,& you will enjoy it more ...There were certain mistakes and that's how so many things left behind and some people must have had a bad time ...But in Sahaja Yoga, you have to forgive and forget and enjoy the best. So, I only able to meet you tomorrow, maybe before the public program ...or maybe or may not be I don't know ...I don't know about myself ... Its a funny situation and last of all I have got something for you to spread on the ground ...For everyone, I have brought a present today ...And something to cover up yourself ...For the ladies it's different, for the gents it is different ...And I hope ....(they are all lying there[unclear])And Harsh will tell you too whom it belongs ...They are all handmade things from the villages and hand-printed absolutely from their [unclear], ....and a very subtle if you see them ...Moreover, they will be useful to you in this country And  ...When we will go to Brahmapuri we will wash them And they will become very soft ...Just Now they are hard as in the beginning it's rather hard in India ...So now we have got something very very nice for you ...& Then we will have the last music...

You heard that song sung in England ...Bhim Sane Joshi sang this song as 'Kanha tujhi ghongari ' & he says...The 'Ghongari ' is a rustic type of blanket which is used multipurpose sort...And he says that is such a  beautiful one means this body and while the mind is not so good. I am full of pride, I am full of ego, I have so many funny things in my head, that sort of 'Ghongari' you have given me.  That is why we have given you one Ghongaris, and you can enjoy it while sitting down and spreading...... It's very good when you wash it ...It becomes very soft and nice...so that's one thing and then there is one sheet for men and one sheet for ladies ...They also looked very crooked, to begin with, but if you wash them they will become very nice ...And they can be used for various purposes. Can you bring?  Such a lot ...

Some for small little girls ...For smaller ladies ...We have something smaller ...For the bigger ladies something ...
