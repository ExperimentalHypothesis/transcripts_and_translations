1986-1222 Music Program

2020Sahaja Yogi: [Marathi]. We shall start our program with the three mantras.Bhajan, "Pratham Tula Vandito" in Marathi.34:55[Applause]Sahaja Yogi: [Marathi]. I’m repeating some songs again, because, if it is not so, we’ll not satisfy You.Bhajan, "Amhi Matajincha Charnasi Alo" in Marathi. (Written by Ananta Damle.)

47 :13Sahaja Yogi: Now we are near the lotus feet of Mataji. Now we all request Her to open our Sahasrara.Bhajan, "Ughad sahasrara mate" in Marathi.

57:31Sahaja Yogi: [Marathi. He asked Shri Mataji to translate].Shri Mataji: This is a song written by a great poet called Namadeva.There was a very great poet and a great Realized soul called Namadeva. He was a tailor. But in the Kingdom of God, he was a prince. And he met another prince who was a potter and his name was Gora Kumhhar. "Kumbhar" means the potter. So how they recognized each other! What love they felt for each other! They were from two different places.In the same way, when the Sahaja Yogis meet each other, from any places whatsoever, they just feel that love, that oneness, that goodness, that belonging. And as they were the great poet, they described it that, “I came to see here the formless God, but here I see him in the form”. ‘Nirguna’ is a formless and the ‘Saguna’ is the form.They beautifully put everything so well. It’s very touching and it gives Me a great hope that whether you are from India or from England or from America or any other country, you are all born of one Mother. And you are Realized souls of very high degree. The sign of a very good high soul is that he recognizes the divinity in another person and enjoys that, worships it and love it.Same way, Shri Namdev met Nanaka. He went to Punjab. And his poems are written by Shri Nanaka in his great book called Granth Sahib. So, how he respected this gentleman from Maharashtra, and he was in Punjab. So, the distance does not matter. What matters is the oneness in your Spirit.That time there was no Mother to tell them, no one to guide them. They were all alone in different places. But whenever they had a chance to meet, they would travel for miles together to see each other and enjoy each other’s company. I see that vision now among you all. So, thank you very much.It’s a very beautiful song, I wish you had known Marathi language. This is not easy to translate the whole thing.

1:02:22Sahaja Yogi: This song is based on "Shuddha Sarang" raga.Bhajan, "Nirgunache bheti aalo saguna sange" in Marathi.

1:11:45[Applause]Sahaja Yogi: Ambeta JogawaShri Mataji: He is asking for the Yoga. That’s why it’s called Ambe, means the Kundalini. When they say, "Ude, ude ", that means, "Oh, Mother get away from this ". In the folklore, they used to sing, "Oh Mother, please be awakened and let me have the ‘yog’. That’s called in the ‘alokya’ language or the rustic languages ‘Jogawa’. Yo’ is made into ‘Jo’. Like as we have ‘Yeshu’ and ‘Jesu‘. In the same way.1:13:45

Bhajan, "Jogawa, Adimaya Amba Bai" in Marathi.

1:24:26[Applause][Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi.]Shri Mataji: This is another poet, tremendous.

This is a song written by another great poet, Eknath. It’s great poets we have had, all great saints and poets. And this song is so subtle and so beautifully blended with a rustic life, that in every village they sing this song. I wonder how many really understand the subtleties. This thing that, “I will ask for the Yoga from my Mother”. But throughout, what she says is that, “I will give up all these attachments that I have, I will give up my false pride, I will give up my ego”, in a way as if you give up all your funny relationships, and funny ideas of relations. “And I will become absolutely without attachments. And then you gave me my Yoga”. They are asking the Mother.But also, it also says that, “I will then collect all the flowers of my bodha”. And you know, the word ‘bodha’ means, it’s what you feel on your central nervous system. “All the experiences on my central nervous system I will collect them as flowers, in my flower container, and I will leave it to you”.It’s a very, very subtle song, you know when you – I didn’t know it, I mean I didn’t hear it that intensely as I did it today. And then it says that, “So, I will cross this ocean of illusion, pass through the tunnel”, and this is the Brahma Nadi, through the tunnel and the end of it. Because Eknatha was a great, very great poet and a Realized soul. He said these things in a very local language, I should say, very rustic language. And in all the villages they sing this song.So, basically the roots are there. People are not naive you see, this is what it is. In this country, that, especially in Maharashtra, it is no difficult to talk to them about Self-realization, about Kundalini, about anything. It’s gone into their blood. And, this is surprisingly, it is just a folklore, it’s a folklore, such a subtle one.1:27:29

Sahaja Yogi: He Adi Ma, He Anti Ma.[Marathi]Shri Mataji: It says that, "After seeing your lotus feet, where will my mind go? Where will my attention go? When I’ve seen your lotus feet. This is Tukaram, a great poet and a great saint".

1:44:36[Applause]Shri Mataji: These are the nine descriptions of the nine incarnations of the Goddess. And they tell when She [inaudible] and goes for the crossing of the liver, I mean, there she crosses the barriers.It’s beautiful because it is said that she takes different forms and that’s how they have described all the forms of the Goddess.

1:45:48Shri Mataji: Yes, Gregoire?Gregoire: Shri Mataji, it looks like - I wanted to ask you that, if the fan has any meaning. It must have.Shri Mataji: I am fanning for you all.[Laughter][Applause]

Shri Mataji: Can you accompany these ragas?Sahaja Yogi: I tried, Shri Mataji. But I am afraid because the effect is very-

[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi.]Shri Mataji: This is the raga of the majesty, means of the queen.

Bhajan, "Ai Giri Nandiri" in Sanscrit

1:52:04Shri Mataji: Adi Shankaracharya’s description to greet them. It’s very difficult. His poetry is beyond really any logic, any mental understanding. So great he is, so great. And now he got all these words put together with sweet alliteration, all kinds of methods, all the figures of speech in such a fast way. It’s so beautifully done. So, may God bless you all.1:52:37

You all try to learn this. All kinds of tongue twisters are there. You improve in your grammatical and in your pronunciation.

1:56:29Raga[Applause]

2:09:08Shri Mataji: Now this is the last sog or the last melody of Bhairavi. And after that, you that that tomorrow morning, you have to go and maybe that you can go late. You need not get up very early. [Laughter]But I hope you’ll get up at nine and leave by nine thirty.[Applause]Because you will take about one and a half hour to reach the river where you all are going to be stationed very well, nearest the beautiful river which is known as ’Pravara’. And they say that, "You should take a bath in the river Ganges. You should drink the water of the river Pravara ". And you will be stationed there, in a beautiful surrounding. But you would like to have a bath also. So, the sooner you leave, the more time you’ll have for a bath. [Laughter. Applause]If you reach at 11, you’ll have 3 hours. If you reach at 12, you’ll have two hours, So, it is for you to choose. You can take your time. It’s all [available? Unclear] for you.[Cut in the audio]I was saying the food will be ready at two o’clock. So, you organize in such a way there a one and half hour journey and two hours, minimum, of a bath. So, whatever time you think proper, you’d better leave and have a nice time there. I may be there. I may not be there. I can’t say. And after that, we have to go for the public program in the evening. So, you can dress there. It’s a beautiful garden they say. And next day we have to go to Rahuri – to Pune, I am sorry. So, that’s how it’s going to be.Moreover, at this juncture, I would like to thank the great musicians who are sitting here. Mr Savankar has been such an asset to Sahaja Yoga. He has brought beautiful melodies, beautiful songs of great devotion and dedication, and such creative rhythms that you all are enjoying it so much. I hope to invite him some time to London and to other Western countries and to America. [Applause]

This is the same joy that one feels for a Sahaja Yogi, as you all are Sahaja Yogis and he is also a Sahaja Yogi, this joy is so much mutual. I thank all his party and all the other people who are here. And his brother who is singing so well and all the ladies who have so melodious voices. For them, I’ve been very kind and adaptable because I do not have this mister [inaudible] - whatever it is, we must be very grateful to God, for bringing us together in this manner, in singing the praise of the Lord, in such surrendered moods. It is a very rare sight for Me, a very rare sight. And I really enjoyed it thorough. I am especially thankful to Dr Sanghvey, Harsh and his family and the family of Dr Savankar. All the others who have helped him to make this music so successful, from all the Sahaja Yogis, I would like to thank them very much for making this spontaneous stay so successful. [Applause]

Last but not the least, I thank all of you for bearing lots of inconveniences in this country of ours where it is very comfortable for the Spirit but not so comfortable for the body! [Laughter]I hope the rest of the journey would be better, more comfortable and you will enjoy it more. There were certain mistakes and that’s how some of the things were left behind and some people must have had a bad time. But in Sahaja Yoga, you have to forgive and forget and enjoy the best.So, I’ll only be able to meet you tomorrow maybe before the public program or maybe I may be there, I don’t know. I don’t know about myself. [Laughter]It’s a funny situation. And last of all, I have got something for you to spread on the ground. For everyone, I have brought a present today. And something to cover up yourself. For the ladies it’s different, for the gents it is different. And I hope [Marathi] They are all lying there and Harsh will tell you to whom it belongs. They are all handmade things from the villages and hand-printed absolutely from their [cut in the audio], and very subtle if you see them.Moreover, they will be useful to you in this country. And when we will go to Brahmapuri we will wash them and they will become very soft. Just now they are hard as in the beginning it’s rather hard in India. [Laughter]So, now we have got something very, very nice for you [inaudible] Dekade, and that’s all. And then we will have the last music.[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi.]‘Kanha tujhi ghongari ‘, you heard that song sung in England. Bhim Sane Joshi sang this song as ‘Kanha tujhi ghongari’. And he says the "ghongari" is a rustic type of a blanket which is used multipurpose sort. And he says that, "That is such a beautiful one", means this body. "And while the mind is not so good, I am full of pride, I am full of ego, I have so many funny things in my head. What sort of "ghongari" you have given me?" That is why I am given you one "ghongari", [Laughter] that you can enjoy for sitting down and spreading and it’s very good when you wash it, it becomes very soft and nice. So, that’s one thing and then there is one sheet for men and one sheet for ladies. They also looked very crooked to begin with, but if you wash them, they will become very nice. And they can be used for various purposes. Can you bring?

Such a lot!

Some for small little girls, you see, for smaller ladies. We have something smaller. For the bigger ladies something.

It’s one for the men. It’s very interesting, this one is. Let Me see.Now this one, say, is for a little girl, say, Nathalie can have this. Nathalie, come along! To cover herself, you see.Now this is interesting because I think the men would love it. It’s a beautiful piece of art all handmade. [Applause] And this is worn by the Aboriginals here. And it’s all done with hand, you can see it. So, it’s quite subtle. So, this is for the men. And that’s for the ladies. And how to find it? Just cover it, let’s see. And this is for the equisized, for each one of you, for sitting down, for meditation, for anything that you want to have. These ones are.It looks nice, isn’t it?Sahaja Yogis: Very nice.Shri Mataji: So, you can get it distributed. Now if you want or later whichever way you want. So, I have got all these things today. How do you like this one for the men?Sahaja Yogis: Ah, beautiful.[Applause]Shri Mataji: And this one for the ladies. Some are small [Applause].And some are big. So, there are four in one. So, somebody should take charge and distribute it properly.So, depends on. You just distribute according to the sizes. It’s quite nice, aren’t they?Sahaja Yogi: It’s beautiful.Shri Mataji: Yes, they are very beautiful. So.
