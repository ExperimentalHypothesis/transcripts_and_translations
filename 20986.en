Comment 1 Nasik

There was a very great poet and a great Realized soul called Namadeva. He was a tailor. But in the Kingdom of God, he was a prince. And he met another prince who was a potter and his name was ‘Bora Kumhar’. ‘Kumhar’ means the potter.  So how they recognized each other! What love they felt for each other! They were from two different places.

In the same way, when the Sahaja Yogis meet each other, from any places whatsoever, they just feel that love, that oneness, that goodness, that belonging. And as they were the great poet, they described it that, "I came to see here the formless God, but here I see him in the form". ‘Nirguna’ is a formless and the ‘Saguna’ is the form.

They beautifully put everything so well. It's very touching and it gives Me a great hope that whether you are from India or from England or from America or any other country, you are all born of one Mother and you are a Realized souls of very high degree. The sign of a very good high soul is that he recognizes the divinity in another person and enjoys that, worships it and love it.

Same way, Shri Namdev met Nanaka. He went to Punjab. And his poems are written by Shri Nanaka in his great book called Granth Sahib. So, how he respected this gentleman from Maharashtra, and he was in Punjab. So the distance does not matter. What matters is the oneness in your Spirit.

That time there was no Mother to tell them, no one to guide them. They were all alone in different places. But whenever they had a chance to meet, they would travel for miles together to see each other and enjoy each other's company. I see that vision now among you all. So, thank you very much.

It's a very beautiful song, I wish you had known Marathi language. This is not easy to translate the whole thing.

And Let me have the ‘yog’...that’s called in the ‘alokya’ language or the rustic language as ‘Jogawa’...’Yo’  ismade into ‘Jo’. Like as we have ‘Yeshu ‘ and ‘Jesu‘; in the same way

Comment 3

This is a song written by another great poet, Eknath. Great poets we have, all great saints and poets. And this song is so subtle and so beautifully blended with a rustic life, that in every village they sing this song. I wonder how many really understand the subtleties. This thing that, "I will ask for the Yoga from my Mother". But throughout, what she says is that, "I will give up all these attachments that I have, I will give up my false pride, I will give up my ego", in a way as if you give up all your funny relationships, and funny ideas of relations. "And I will become absolutely without attachments. And then you gave me my Yoga".They are asking the Mother.

But also, it also says that, "I will then collect all the flowers of my 'bodha'". And you know, the word 'bodha' means, it's what you feel on your central nervous system. "All the experiences on my central nervous system I will collect them as flowers, in my flower container, and I will leave it to you".

It's a very, very subtle song, you know when you - I didn't know it, I mean I didn't hear it that intensely as I did it today. And then it says that, "So, I will cross this ocean of illusion, pass through the tunnel", and this is the Brahma Nadi, through the tunnel and the end of it. Because Eknatha was a geat, very great poet and a Realized soul. He said these things in a very local language, I should say, very rustic language. And in all the villages they sing this song.

So, basically the roots are there. People are not naive you see, this is what it is. In this country, that, especially in Maharashtra, it is no difficult to talk to them about Self-realization, about Kundalini, about anything. It's gone into their blood. And, this is surprisingly, it is just a folklore, it's a folklore, such a subtle one.

Comment 4

It's beautiful because it is said that she takes different forms and that’s how they have described all the forms of the Goddess.

Comment 5

His poetry is beyond, really, any logic, any mental understanding. So great he is! So great! And how he got all these words put together. Its alliteration all that, all kinds of methods, all the figures of speech in such a fast way. It's so beautifully done. So may God bless you all.

Comment 6

Because you will take about one and a half hour to reach the river where you all are going to be stationed very well, nearest the beautiful river which is known as ’Pravara’. And they say that you should take a bath in the river Ganges. You should drink the water of the river ‘Pravara'. And you will be stationed there, in a beautiful surrounding. But you would like to have a bath also. So, the sooner you leave, the more time you'll have for a bath.

If you reach at 11, you'll have 3 hours. If you reach at 12, you'll have two hours, So, it is for you to choose. You can take your time. It's all [available? Unclear] for you.

[Cut in the audio]

I was saying the food will be ready at two o'clock. So, you organize in such a way there a one and half hour journey and two hours, minimum, of a bath. So, whatever time you think proper, you'd better leave and have a nice time there. I may be there, I may not be there. I can't say and after that, we have to go for the public program in the evening. So you can dress there. It's a beautiful garden they say.

And the next day we have to go to Rahuri - to Pune, I am sorry. So, that's how it's going to be. Moreover at this juncture, I would like to thank the great musicians who are sitting here. Mr Savankar has been such an asset to Sahaja Yoga. He has brought beautiful melodies, beautiful songs of great devotion and dedication, and such creative rhythms that you all are enjoying it so much. I hope to invite him some time to London and to other Western countries and to America. [Applause]
