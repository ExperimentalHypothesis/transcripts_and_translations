Talk: 1980-1130 Farewell Talk with Introduction, Ledru Rollin, Paris, France

Shri Mataji: Please sit down. All right!

Yogi: Because today we are saying farewell to our mother for some time and also to our respected brother from Australia, Dr Waren, who has worked tirelessly while he is being here. On our mother's behalf and our behalf,  and done tremendous work behind the scene to help things work out in this country; and we want make this a special occasion of just letting him know that we love him very dearly and he is, Whatever he may say to us, it does our heart good. [CLAP]

Dr Warren: Shri Mataji, it’s really a surprise to me. [Laugh]

Shri Mataji: Please come little further.

Dr Warren: I think most important thing I can say that how much I am enjoying being here. It’s very very important that we all come to the heart, we all have to circulate and I feel tremendous joy whenever I know that I come up here. Because I don't think in a way that I am doing anything. When you are in presence of Shri Mataji, as many of you feel, it’s such a expression of dedication. But dedication that take you beyond mental apprehension of what dedication is about, because it just work. Dedication is something which mother spoke about in a guru Puja about two years ago. And one thing that is very outstanding is - it acts in a most remarkable way that I will come back to that in a moment. Because I want to talk about two level or perhaps or both end of spectrum good and a bad because when I come here with blessings to say something to my brothers and sisters around the world. It’s possible to make little bit of comparison which may be  useful and please understand that it is useful only in a sense that if it come from my heart it's because I want to enjoy the collectivity more, I want to enjoy dedication to mother more, I want to enjoy Sahaja yoga more. So if I say anything that is little sharp or critical, number 1, I am absolutely part of whole and not wanting to feel in any way apart,  and yet sometimes my heart ache that things are not moving ahead as quickly in this beautiful country. So in very very positive side, one thing I told to Shri Mataji when I came to England this time was that the Agnya chakra seem to be so much clear, seem to be so much more light the whole head, you wake in morning you feel so much vibration. You go to meditation looking forward for more meditation. And I why wonder why that was. Of course it is principally because Shri Mataji is here. She is here for goodness sake how many years and this working it out and working it out. But I suppose if I may, Shri Mataji gives some credit to application and hard work of the Sahaja yogis of England because they are getting up in the morning and they are meditating early in morning and they are clearing it out there chakras in way, which is starting to manifest. Everyone is feeling that lightness in the head a lot more they never thought before. And that's great! that's tremendous! that's means that ego in some way is coming down, that's mean the Kundalini can rise with far more force and  we can be more securely connected to our divine mother. And this is such a blessing and such a important point that we all have to enjoy that tremendous feeling or progress that we have established. But at another level that we all know there are problems and I think the problems seems to be stand from almost the opposite of what I am saying. One is almost the converse of the other. If Kundalini doesn’t rise strongly past the Agnya and reach Sahasrara and that dedication to our mother doesn't come with tremendous absolutely fulfilling force. Then Kundalini just stops there. And our entrance towards kingdom of God is weak. We become feeble people. We become as Christ said 'yeah of little faith' and we don't get the blessings of Sahasrara fully. Its little bit like a wobbly connection, a weak connection, on-off on-off, and so Kundalini hovers somewhere at that level. We have to improve this tremendously. So all of this must know very thing I am sure we can mentally understand. But we have to know it in our heart that connection with our divine mother has to be absolutely strong. It can’t be wishy-washy thing. It can’t be something govern by very grace of our ego and super ego. It can’t be apprehended mentally. This reflection of almighty God is the Atma (Spirit), has to become reality of total dedication to our mother and so by being totally part of mother; we slowly and surely ascend into the kingdom of God and that oneness with the Lord. This I have experienced. If I made any progress in Sahaja yoga it is because of one single thing - it is total dedication to Shri Mataji, not another thing, I have done that I could say any different to any other sahaja yogi, but in dedication to mother, I believe I have tried really hard; and I believe it had helped me in my spiritual ascent. And I have to thank mother for giving me this chance. The biggest single problem is here is that our dedication is wobbly, our faith is wobbly. You should see the subtility of divine working. Shri Mataji has taken birth, AdiShakti has taken birth, holy Spirit has taken birth, that we can mentally apprehend but do we know what it means; do we know God in his bounties goodness has blessed each and every one of the seekers with her physical presence on this earth. So that divine can have mouthpiece, so that all of the children can see the love of mother manifest, so that all of her children can see the compassion and feel it in their heart. And yet, she often says she is a bubble. There is something which we can’t quite know about know about Shri Mataji. We can’t feel them, we don’t know who she is! Do we know that she is manifestation of Almighty God on this earth in his total form as the power of God, as the desire of God. You remember the announcement of her incarnation-"I have come to this earth as desire of God, as Adi Shakti, as the one who has come to fulfill the seeking of all the great seekers of the past." I wonder how many of us really know with such dedication in our heart that is a reality, not apprehended here, but felt in the heart, known in the heart. And of course when heart opens you enjoy the fulfillment of Sahasrara. But what we do; we wobble between Agnya. We don't have faith. Look at the miracles. I mean my little miracle in the past has nothing that I ran a motor car for three weeks without a petrol and at the end of three weeks, the tank was full. That's nothing! Have you seen other miracle that Shri Mataji has performed? She cannot perform any miracle, if you are obstructing the miracle by putting your ego or your superego, by putting your Chakra, but putting your lack of faith, she cannot work any miracle out in anyone of us. Let us know collectively. It is upto us and that is dedication is! It is more than surrender. Surrender has certain level of mental understanding. I surrender, but what does it mean? The dedication is a heartfelt thing. It is inside. It touches the Sahasrara and it opens it out and you began to feel that tremendous force, that tremendous light. So let us not fit into the category that Christ spoke about. Not he told about murmuring soul. He also talked about they have little faith. At England, we have been tested on this point. What is the centre. It is centre of the Adi Shakti. It's the centre of the desire of God, it’s the centre of our divine mother, it’s the centre of manifestation of the Holy Spirit. Do you know in Italy they call her 'Grande Madre' which means the great mother. They have perceived it. The newspaper man, we didn't tell him. This is what she is! Oh my God! a priest, a Franciscan priest is standing up in front of eleven hundred people declaring that she is that and thanking her in name of church for that.  What we doing, we are wobbling, we are talking about blacklist with this with that, all those non sense. I mean the England is the heart. That I seem to feel more heart in Italy. So we have to know with absolute certainty who she is. We have to achieve that divinity, which we all know we can achieve. Now, yes the Agnya Chakra is clearing. But No, we are not reaching Sahasrara, we are not yet established at Sahasrara. Let's face it! We are one foot inside the kingdom of God. Many others, let's be right inside there. And other thing that has to achieved is, Mataji has to be achieved through collectivity. There is none way traffic between myself and Shri Mataji. That is there anyway. that's automatic; That's fundamental common denominator to each one of us. That only way we can achieve fully our own divinity is by approaching her divinity through the collective. If we think we have special relationship with Shri Mataji, we are finished. If we think that we have some preferential advantage over other Sahaja yogis with mother, we finished. If we think we can take mother's time more than any other, we are finished. The only way that Shri Mataji in this form can be fully approached is through the collective being, is through Sahaja Yoga, is through the inner state of Nirvikalpa, not thoughtless awareness but doubtless awareness; and we all have to approach her in that way. Now if Shri Mataji gives you a little hint, we shouldn't question her, we shouldn't say but this but that or problem is such and such and so and so, which we all do, I do it and we all do it. She is this incarnation of the desire of God and thus such a hint to the way human beings who are just babies in kingdom of God, should adhere with absolute strictness and with complete clarity and dedication. If you follow the hints she gives, everything should work out. If you oppose it, if you say but or if you say problem is, nothing will work out, and I am afraid, this country has greatest tendency to say the problem is, but what if, how; all these questions to our ascent. We take everything Shri Mataji says as hint to our growth and spiritual ascent, we will just grow and grow and grow. Look at the people of India, particularly the people of Maharashtra. I wouldn't say Delhi. Delhi people are very much like us, they are very caught up, still attached to you know-Mataji can I set up meeting, can i do this, can I do that. But people of Maharashtra, they know her, they know her nature, she is Adi Shakti. Oh my God! She is Adi Shakti, she is the one. How can I do puja to her, how can I please her. Instead mother is here, what can I do to please her. Instead, mother is here, what can I do to please them. It's not like that, it is what can we do to please her. The first people in Maharashtra need not to be told this. So each one of us, should be one hand, really feel essence of achievement that we have certainly making at stronger and stronger this Agnya chakra, the centre of Lord Jesus Christ and his mother. But we are not yet strong in the kingdom of God. I can say other cities and countries in Europe have past England in that dedication. That foothold in kingdom of God is strong. India of course is unquestioned but miracle is not far behind in these European cities. Let us flow into Shri Mataji saying "We want to take the responsibility for the collective being. We want to assume our responsibility and jolly that we are going to do it". Do we know there are 40 Americans going to India? These are important points. You know that when I say these things to you, if I am really critical, Please forgive me Mother, forgive me everyone, but I am trying to do it here. I feel so much pound of this. I come from I suppose land of Shri Ganesha. I have tremendous devotion to mother. I have tremendous dedication to her, but I still don't know her. I hardly can approach her. But I want to approach her. I want to enter kingdom of God fully, so to stay in place of sahasrara strongly. Please all of you as tremendous act of dedication, let's make the next year, when she comes back, strengthening our self, strengthening our faith; Making our self-total; putting down our ego; being rid of conditioning, getting rid of all projections and our mental activity and just enjoying mother's love. Jai Shri Mataji. [Everyone] Jai Shri Mataji! [Clap]

Shri Mataji: Warren's word had really moved my heart and England is my heart. England should also feel moved, that's the spirit of Shri Ganesha. And I must say that I have seen so many things in Warren which are very heartening. Whenever I feel desperate about things, then seeing him, I feel I must do something more. Because he really loves me so much, I have seen that, with complete selfless dedication. Dedication is word which doesn't have that beauty of love; I mean if I am sitting down, he will immediately worry if I got the tea or if I need some heating, little things here and there; I watch and I feel surprised like any other Sahaja yogi he will be jumping up here and there finding out things to adjust. If I really once say that may be, he just doesn't do it. I have never seen him asking me to give him time to meet him, not even once he has said mother I must come and see you. Nothing! Never! I have not known how much money he has spent throughout his trip really. And I was waiting for someone to say that pay for his travel because he really spent all his money. And I was happy that David brought this point to me. I was very happy. One thing I feel that you cannot ask for love that something you can't. It is very difficult thing to ask, but that thing is point one should see. When of think of Shri Ganesha, just have to know that he loves the mother so much that even a slightest hint, he knows what I want. He knows me too well. He is not at all, so compassionate as myself, as he cannot forgive those who try to insult me or those who try to cheat me, those who try to be arrogant or egoistical. He doesn't, he doesn't believe in that. He cannot. He wants to punish. He is ready to punish, very anxious to punish. But if I say No, spare him, he listens to me. That's his quality. He cannot bear anything against me, can't bear. And left to him, I don't know how many sahaja yogis would have been there. Even to say 'no Mother' itself, he cuts you out on that point. I don't want that it should happen because he doesn't know that you are still needing help, and attention, and tremendous compassion. But you can only know your mother through Shradha (Dedication), through faith. What he said is true. And why this faith, I mean you see miracle everyday not only today. Such a game such play is going on. How I have been able to express myself slowly, I don't want to give you any shocks. In a very beautiful manner I have tried to bring it forth the play of the divine. But I feel that even now people get into the arguments. If I say i it will not work out, it is not good, I have to spend at least 4-5 hours going around and around and bringing points into heads of people that is not good, that will not help. Once I have asked him what happened, why you are so weaken, whatever I say, he gets hint and agrees. He said mother I have once learnt a lesson, that's my own marriage, you didn't say no, but you did said to me that if it makes you happy, you didn't say it will make you joyous. And I have learnt my lesson from that, but we learnt our lesson, that's my point. We don't learn our lessons. We argue, that comes from me ego. If you have super-ego that will make you mad. Like somebody came from America; and he was just mad that he must come and see me - saying I am busy, I have to correct this book and i have to correct that book and we have to do this advent and that is to be done, I have to look after my household, this and that, I am so busy. But person really made him mad that he must come and see me, and if you come from America, that doesn’t mean that you have to come and see me. If I come to America, it's all right, which is true and we do not realize that what we are doing that we do not love mother, we don't love her, we think of our needs, our impressions, our talking; It's a fact. Like somebody I asked, you speak, you are a good speaker. All right he start speaking and he became egoistic. How can you be! If you start giving good speech, you become mystical. Somebody made good photographs as he is good photographer, he becomes egoistical. You cannot praise anyone in this country, the worst thing. He says Agnya is clear, I don't know what sort of Agnya is clear here. You cannot praise.  I mean I tried to be nice, your photographs are nice, immediately person becomes egoistical. I give work to someone, his ego goes up. What is this? Like a balloon- there is no depth; there is no gravity. Now why. This is a question. He asked me many times, why it happens mother. The reason is I told them, I think they have tap on this, you can go through that. The simple thing is we have lived superficial life here. We are superficial people. Because society is such that. This machine has made us like this or we have read books, we have pampered ego, our fore father has went and fought in others countries thinking no end of themselves. Then we had this war. With war we become more non nonsensical, either aggressive or we have become super-ego. We have bhoots (evil spirit), we have conditioning. All this things are there. We are not genuine in ourselves. That's point! So I think being that is going to be enlightened by your spirit is covered by this ego, and on top of that you have sheen of superficial being that you are. So mother says, all right; mother did this, all right. Nothing goes inside. There is no love. If you are in love with someone, even if the person is in that vicinity anywhere, like mother is in London. Just think! Mother is in London, just think. If you love me just think. What a happy thought it is. She is in England. It's a happy thought. Think on those lines. But it doesn’t work out because that genuine thing, genuine thing that is inside is covered with ego or superego; your bhoots are in between. So what happens that you live with that superficial nonsense? Nothing goes inside, it’s all that level. You ask anyone, I am all right, I am like this I am like that. Why. Nothing goes inside. Why. because genuine self has gone. What is going to enlighten you is not your artificial thing. You know artificial fiber, if you have artificial fiber, it doesn't penetrate anything, it can penetrate into everything, but nothing can penetrate into it. Like that there is artificial things on us, and we live with it all the time. Now why he said about Maharashtra because Maharashtrians are not exposed to artificiality. They don't know artificiality. People thinks that they are stupid, they are foolish, they are not good for business, they are not good for this, they are not good for that. But the main thing is that their genuine being is not covered with any nonsense. I am something, I have never seen Warren feeling in that way, that's something surprise me. I have never seen him feeling that he is important, that he should be near me, he should be in my company. Never. Never ever I heard him anywhere around me. I have to call him. Unless and until I call him, he will never come before me. He will see if I need him, otherwise, he don't bother. He is just feels I am around that I am around, mother is somewhere. But if I tells him, Warren I want to, whatever it may be, and he just rush and come. He is very good example for you. I am happy there is some example of this kind. There are many others. I am not saying it's only Warren. And then if you take any responsibility in Sahaja yoga, then you start thinking you are great. You are great sahaja yogi, you have done this, you have done the postering, and you have done this. This shows the caliber. Shows the caliber. People for absolutely death condition have risen so high. And people from normal condition are quite nowhere there. That's caliber.  Now everybody has that caliber. What I am trying to say, every one of us have that caliber. But it is not evident on everyone because amount of covering they have. Everybody has capacity to love. Every one of us. But if you have yourself completely with artificiality you can't love. If you ask mother how to love, what I am to tell. I love you! No doubt, I love all of you, I love you very much. I am not bothered about you. What I find, when I am bothered about somebody that person start taking advantage, I don't mind taking advantage, but by taking advantage that person goes down completely. If I am bothered about something, then one thing is that, they immediately start thinking they are very important, that mother is so much bothered about me. Now try to understand that this is the country which is my heart. And Sahasrara is nothing else but heart. Have you noticed how it nicely managed already that if Kundalini has to break it has to break from heart chakra. If your heart is not alright, then cannot break your Sahasrara. Have you seen that; that the Brahmrandra, the last opening is on the heart chakra. I know everyone very well. They are people who are medium with us. I know that. But they don't know they go to hell. It is very dangerous style you are in. Be careful. And that makes me feel even worse that they don't know on what horrible times your feet are dangly. So don't play games. I know English language has its own styles and things. English mannerism has its own ways and methods. Forget that you are English. That’s the best way. English think that we are different people. We are of the heart. In Italy I told one journalist lady, who had come, very good lady. She said mother one thing I didn't like about centers is that England is the heart. How it can be! Horrible! She couldn't believe it. She said only because you told I have tolerated. But anybody else saying I would not tolerate. So how far we have gone down as English. You should have seen the reputation of English abroad. And advancement we have made to reach the status of . So when there is such a situation in this country, then how serious we have to be about it. because this country is either going to save the world or it's going to mar the world because it is at the Sahasrara where mother is to be expected, where mother has to accepted, worshiped and adored. But do we have that seriousness of understanding that we are born at a time where responsibility is much more than other people. On the contrary we are born on heart, so we are great people, so finished. 

There are certain things which you follow simple things is going to help you. The other day I met somebody who has non-nonsensical thing like Hamsa. I said Hamsa how can you have. Are you putting oil every day, are you putting ghee every day. He said no. I said why. Its simple thing like that. Why don't do it every day. Mother is here, she will look after us. Responsibility is not felt because there is no seriousness about it, you don't know. The job is great, you can do it. You have the caliber. Face yourself up, every one of you, face yourself up. And I find, really I must say, Italians really I must say, what Warren says is true. We have Antonio with us in house you see. He is very different from all other English people. He is very different. He is so balanced. Then, then there are some funny people with us, I have seen. They are with us. They will go to this course, they will do this that, non-sense going on. And one person like that can spoil all of that. We have so many stupid people on periphery in Sahaja Yoga in England. We do not have so many numbers anywhere else on the periphery. We have tremendous people as well as some people are really horrid. I was trying to make a blacklist everywhere and we have maximum number in England. Maximum number in England. Now when I am going, I am leaving you here. You see my heart wrenches really sometimes, I know you are not really mature enough, but why not mature. Because there is no seriousness about it. 
Then they will come, we need a leader. Why? Why you need somebody to hit your head all the time to tell you things like that with your own dignity. Why not come back. Now I am going. You all have to work it out. So when you to India, even they say English are the worst. This the certificate. And you have to be the best people better than even Australians. It's so simple because now we are at Sahasrara, working at Sahasrara. You see why I have to say all these things because you are born. You are born in this country. You are the people. But whatever I say, is Mother speaks very well. Let's have recap. All right, Very nice to hear. It is great entertainment that mother is talking, she talks very well. It doesn't go inside you. Doesn't go. It is like plastic on top. Complete plastic cover. 
So one has to learn certain things. Few things are like Vishudhi chakra. English don't talk but they move their heads too much. If they say yes, they will constantly say yes yes yes yes yes. All the time their necks are moving. I mean they have long necks and must want their necks moving all the time. There is no need. Why to bring your necks so much. Even if they say something, yes yes yes yes. Like they will say, today program was very well, yes yes yes. Certified. They don’t see because they don't want to see it. Thus Vishudhi chakra, you don't talk, but when you talk horrible things come out. So you are so afraid of talking that you don't talk. But talk to yourself on the mirror, talk to yourself. See how you can respect, how you can be kind, how you could be nice. But no, practice is more of sarcasm, more of saying harsh things, horrible things. And that's it. It should have, I know it's a flare, it should have beautiful thing, it should not be a serious sermon. No, but say something straight and nice. It’s so evident. When I say something sweet, like the other day, we were in France, I asked you better speak Italian and somebody should translate. On the way I was thinking, who will translate, because somebody should know French and Italian well. Who will do that? When I entered hall I saw Rodhe you see, standing there. I didn't know that, she was there, she had come all the way. All the way she has run from there and now she is holding in her hand mic and she is holding photo. You know my heart became so large. And I really felt like embracing her and eyes you see, spoke, what I felt. The way she came around, she was there. I was worried who will translate and there she was. See I also get help like this. When people love me I know I get help. If they don't love me, there are obstructions, problems, this that. You get so fed up, you don't want to see them, and sometimes it happens. But if there is love, you know whole communications work through love, the subtle love, the whole ether has got that subtler love, every matter has got subtle love, everything has, and whole thing you see goes into waves and you just get the message. But if you are not at reception point, or if you are not there, nothing works. Either you or me, its mutual thing, I help you, but you help me too. What’s me is you. But you are not at that level because you are on superficiality. And because of this superficiality also you are not collective. The sense of collectivity is very tricky one must understand. Some people start forming groups and they think they are bigger. Forming group is sign of most uncollective behavior. But they think, we are being very collective, we are being very nice, very happy people. So what I have to tell you is that you understand your responsibility. [No Sound]. 
It gives you feeling of joy, but there is awe, you will love that awe, you enjoy that awe. Mother is around! What are we doing? Where are we? That's first sign that you are realizing who is your mother. First sign. It is very easy to just to jump into it, just like your Kundalini awakening I can tell you. And Americans, you know about [not clear], when they start, they have to just start, that's point, I know that, Americans has to just start, and they will shoot off, and they shoot off very fast, their speed, if they take the speed, you must know, what they are capable of. There is another one that is coming up very well which I must tell you is Munich. And he wants to go there. There is foolish stupid women she told me all wrong about many people. So I thought this is the sample I must not go. Then I felt the vibrations, tremendous vibrations; and seriousness with which they were hearing me, as if there was a mathematical class or some sort of science class I was talking about, with complete attention, not even blinking. Absolute absorption of every word I was saying. I was amazed at these people. And once the Germans get to Sahaja Yoga, God save you all.[laugh] I can assure you, you cannot come up to their levels, because they have built up themselves like that. They are people of discipline. And when they will come to Sahaja Yoga, you will see what will happen. So all this lovey-dovey business and this kind of a, what you call in English, I don’t know what you call in English. [Someone from crowd says wishy-washy]. Wishy-washy is different. What I am saying person who is neither here nor there, all the time bending like this. And also telling me I am like this, all this non-sense. How many will be left out, I don't know. If I say anything, just know that I know what it is. I know what is going to happen. But you won't learn your lessons, I know. If I told somebody don't go back or stay back, that person learns; ultimately that this was the thing correct mother said it. How many times, this is the point now. 
So now I am going away. I want to tell you that we all have to be serious people. Whatever mistakes you have committed forget it. Be serious people. Those are egoistical people, trying to form groups, are mediums like, they talk like stupid people trying to organise programs in a stupid way, giving lecture should come down to normal now. Nothing doing. Be serious. We have to be alert. Those who will sleep now will lose completely. I must warn you; is important. Time is short. You are important people, no doubt on that. But if you are not good, you will be losing your position completely. The day when I am thinking of going to India. Here mother is more worried about people who are still not there. She is always worried. Like a boat is going, have got many people in boat quite settled down, even from England. But they are many still halfway in the water, you see, coming up going down. You are not worried about people who are on boat, but you are worried about the people who are still halfway. And that worry is on my head. I am serious. The climate is serious. The weather is serious. How it rained and rained and rained today. The whole nature is bothered. Don’t think that only if you are educated uneducated, you come from this sort of life; that's nothing important. The spirit is above all these things. But to make the spirit shine you see, to work on your nerves, that sheen has to go away, otherwise it will never work. Whatever you do, it should please me, is a one of the way; it should please me. That's one of the signs. So how do we do it? Put me in your heart. Just try to put me in your heart. I am before you now. I am in person.

I was trying to give realization to one of my relation today. And I said that you don't lose your eyes. He said no I am not looking at your face, as when I see you, I feel you are my aunt. So I am just looking at your feet. So that I should not feel any more that you are my aunt. You are very great; and your face is one that puts me into illusions. He could see, I am maha maya, so only at your feet I look; and through your feet only I will get over this barrier, this feeling. In the same way, I know I am maha maya, I have to be. But you have to put my feet into your heart. Just my feet into your heart. Because photo face everything might be an illusion, might be by seeing my face you do not get over your barriers. To say I must see mother, I must do this; Mother must come to my house, she must have food at my place, she must visit my home; all this is so stupid, I cannot understand what the matter with these people is. Mother please come in my heart. Let me clean my heart so that you are there. Put your feet into my heart, let your feet be worshiped in my heart. Let me be not in delusion. Take me away from illusions. Keep me in reality. Take away the sheen of superficiality. Let me enjoy your feet in my heart. Let me see your feet in my heart. Only such people. Even Brahma Vishnu Mahesha have done that. So don't you think you have to do it. So humble down yourself. Humble down yourself in your heart. Humble down yourself. Humble down your heart. Enjoy your humility. Enjoy your virtues. The greatest virtue of sahajayogi is humility. Now so many things you have seen to convince you. But in no way it can mean any kind of subjection. Because what subjection you can give me, think of that. When every subjection is a blessings, what subjection you have given me. Every feeling in the heart is a blessing. Just now you feel it and you feel the joy in your heart. Then what is your subjection about what. I can understand people who have newly come, or just good for nothing. But you are not on periphery. But some of you do go to periphery in no time. You give them some work, finished. If I am sweet to someone, finished. If I see someone, finished. I mean this is too much, I can't be even nice to you. 
If you do any mistakes or anything, then you feel, then you get your left vishudhi. You have done your mistake and finished it. You love me. May be there is something wrong in the love, or something has happened, doesn't matter. Now, I am going to be cautious. I am not going to make any mistakes. How could I do this mistake, because I was not fully in love? If I loved something, I wouldn't have done such mistakes. All right! So develop your love. No, you will do I feel guilty because I have done such a thing. So I miss this and that both. So your mistake becomes a barrier again. Don’t feel guilty about it. We have to progress further. Forget the past forget the past forget the past. We have to go further. We have to be serious people. When we talk we should talk with dignity of that awe. That's very important. Once you develop that awe, your Ekadasha will disappear. Ekadasha will disappear. Just think of the awe. 
See the silence! And the joy, and the the the joy of the oath is deep very deep like a sea. Sea also has upper level as very turbulent, but from inside is very silent, absolutely silent. Feel that depth. Without awe you cannot go down. I have sometimes even said little loudly somethings to Warren, I know. He has never never felt. But with some people I have never said because I know the person won't take it from me. But he never feels that I have said anything wrong or to hurt him in any way. That's sign of complete awe. And it is just a way bit of penetration, a very pint of penetration. Forget the self-importance, forget the greatness that you think about yourself. When you become zero that you become Nirmala. As long as you are like cup, you are small. When boundaries of cup are broken, then you are no more a cup. And this is what today I have to tell you. 

Today is the eleventh day and ten days out of which nine days were period of fight. Tenth day is period of victory. Now eleventh day is of enjoyment. But how can people who do not have awe can enjoy, I cannot understand. Because Ekadasha forms the barrier. Barrier of Ekadasha, you know what it is. Feel the awe and you will go deep into your heart, deep into your heart, because you are at a point where just you have to have gravity to go down, working hard, try to keep that. Slowly and steadily you have come up to that point. Only thing is that you develop your depth, go deep down. I know there are ferocious people. They all will be dropped out in no time. Don't worry about them. I know what people are doing, how they are behaving, I know every one of you very well; each one of you. So respect your body, respect yourself; keep your Hamsa alright at least. And I am sure if you become serious about it, you need a serious understanding of whole thing. That's what is lacking because if you love someone the whole thing becomes entire possession sort of thing. Entire being is so seriously involved into it that you cannot afford to miss anything. And that's it is going to help you. Seriousness never means you are going to enjoy. Enjoyment is so deep, is pouring into the heart. I play with you, always try to say things that will please you. And it should please you much more that what I said today is how to reach your depth. To reach that gravity that will make you Gurus. 
Today I had to talk to you like a Guru because I feel that now time has come for all of you to become Gurus of the right type, not with egos or talking bigs, or creating a big sort of show out of you. But a definite depth within you that people see that here is a beacon of mother. And it is so fantastic. Whole thing is so great to be that. This is what Gurus used to do first of all; is to cleanse people, clear them out, take out their barriers and make them take out their egos by hanging them round, putting them on top of the well; putting them down 5-6 times, dipping them down. This is for what. But now you can do it because I am before you. Because I have come. This is the reason; understand! What Warren has rightly said? You might say that mother was working through him, may be. But, I always work through you if you are one with me, even when I am speaking, you are speaking; and when you are speaking, I am speaking. You know that. But with all this that awe is very important. And that gives you love, complete integration of your heart and your brain. 
The love that thinks is thoughtful. And the third integration the love that acts. But first this integration must be brought in. The love that thinks, which understands, which feels; and then the love that acts. But basic is the love. It's start from the heart. It's the love. I think you better take my tape today, listen to it and meditate. Meditate on that. I want to see my children in England develop that depth. In language in speech in feelings in expressions in the personality; is the only the awe which will make it. But awe which is not frightening, awe which is joy giving. This is the integration of it. Awe that is joy giving. It's not frightening. Open your hearts, it doesn't mean you should be ferocious, with all the care. Have you seen a lotus opening how beautifully it opens, slowly freeing petal so careful, not to hit each other. Slowly it opens out and then the fragrance starts pouring in. The most dignified man, such a flower only can be offered at the lotus feet of the Adi Shakti, isn't it? May God bless you! May God bless you!
