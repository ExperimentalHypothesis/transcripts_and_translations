Evening Talk

For the flowers? This is mummy has done for you? It's very sweet one. This one is? Wood. No, no, no, it started now. You see a little bit of... Just the thing that we feed. See these flowers. Are they nice? The flowers... Are they nice flowers? Such a smiling baby. Such a sweet baby. Such a nice baby. You must smile. You must smile. Are they still like a nervous person? And... What's the Mishon's daughter's name is? Marina. Marina. Marina, ha. She also looses a little bit of her balance, with aarti. Yeah. Very good. You are feeling sleepy. Very quiet, ah? She's very good Mother. She's very quiet. Even Pauline's daughter has improved a lot. Good. Very much better now, very much better. William's [apetite is] very much by this.. I think that work would suit him the best. He did a very good job in our house, you see... And C.P. liked his things that he had cooked and made Me happy.. I had such a problem, I didn't know what to do because you see it's, C.P. won't eat anything and I thought now to give up and go away. But who told Me was [Pray]. She said, "William is a very good cook, if he can help there." I thought, "If he's working, how will he do it?" But he did it very well. You see, Mr. Srivastava eats very little, but if it is good, tasty food then he'll eat, all right. She's feeling sleepy now. Feeling sleepy? All right? You don't smile at all, isn't it? And then it is enough to put a lipstick [unclear] completely. All right, all right. All right, now, just do it. Crawls? Does she? Does she crawl a little? Yes, Mother, she does. Now, gone away. From the distance, smiling. What's her age now? She's eight months old. Slowly, she'll sit down upon you. But she's now a very sweet child, I must say. She doesn't trouble at all. In the beginning you had problems, Yes, a lot. Because you have committed some mistakes I think, about her. You didn't know. But you are rather thin now. What's the problem? You are nursing her? Yes, Mother. And no other milk? No, I haven't been using other milk. I've been traveling so much that I haven't had time to do it. Traveling where? To Exeter? Yes, Mother. How is it? They have got an ashram now in Exeter? Devon town at least. No, another one. Or somebody told Me, very near. What's her name? The one with a pink frock who came? Oh, Carol. No, no, no. Carol's friend I think, the one who came with a pink frock to Loose. What's her name? Carol, Carol, Mother. She, she's also Carol? Yes, that's Carol. She lives in Totnes. She said Dartington. That's right.Yes. And she said she has, they have got an ashram there now, in that place. Good idea. They are very good. They are very good. So, she said now there are three, three persons only, but she hopes to get more. Sahaja Yoga grows you see very slowly, no doubt about it, but it's better to have solid people than to have half baked. You know I'm very thankful to you, you solved really My problem. You don't know I would have given up, and I would have come back, really. Chance to you. [It's a bit short], please eat your food and.... You liked the Italians. They are very interesting people. Very interesting. I'll be coming to Italy in, I think, September or so. There, I start from the 24-th of August, till the fifteenth of September or fourteenth of September, my journey in Switzerland, Austria and Italy, these three countries. I don't know how Gregoire has put it but I will also get the whole program here. But, you have got your passport? I'll go and get it. It's, it's in my thing, I packed it away with... Where? In Sally's house. Oh, I see. And yours? She's keeping my things. I've got my passport. You have got it. Yours is there. You don't have to have a passport yourself, you have to have a visa, that's all. I don't know. You don't have to ask for visa? I don't think so. I've got an Irish passport, Mother. No, but you have to take visa to get to Italy and Europe. All of you, isn't it? So they don't even need a passport. To go to Italy? No, no. It's in Common Market so no visa is necessary. Irish is also in Common Market, Mother, so she's at safe. No problem. No problem? Then when are you going? We have to wait for Isabel and Guido to tell us when we should go. But I have already written to them. Well, we can't escape what they are making in Hampstead, Mother. We can't escape what they are making in Hampstead, on 31-st, and then as soon as we can get it running after that we'll go. So [with our ladies taking up] we can settle. No, the letter I have seen, saying that they want immediately Sahaja Yogis there. So why don't you telephone and find out? Gilbert mentioned that he telephoned last night or the night before and Isabel said she would talk to Guido, because we have a child. So... No, but tell them that Mother said that she, it's all right. Yes. All right? Yes. Gilbert? Should I tell Gilbert? Gilbert? No it's not necessary. Will you please tell her to telephone to these people in Italy, yeah? But Pedro it's there. I'll tell Pedro. Would You like to meet him Mother? Would You like to meet him now? No I will tell that to Guruji. It's not there. Instead I hope you were not disappointed with the number. But I think they must have gone to see the match. Or might be seeing it on the TV. Yes. Their priorities are very wrong and thank God they lost it. Oh. Four-zero, four-zero. Oh, no. Good. It could teach Robson a lesson Mother. He can't goes on it. Who can't go? Robson. He's lost for PP, Mother. He gambled with his teacher? No, with, with friends at school. He should have asked Me. Forgive their confidence, Mother. And ask the vibrations. Even I am here why do you think they had to go? So they had to loose. I think tomorrow you might get more people. Give a bandhan to all the Brighton seekers. Ten times. Come forward, come forward, come forward, all of you. Their priorities are wrong. I don't know when will they be all right. When they are going to hear Your voice and see Your picture, Mother, maybe then. Maybe when they are going to hear Your voice and see Your picture, maybe then their priorities will be right. I don't know. You see, London is a difficult place and that's it. But England is even worse. Even worse, you know. But the other places like Austria, now just imagine. I have been there only once. We had seventy people for the Puja. Seventy people came for the Sahasrar Puja. Now, this place Geneva, sixty-five people. I mean for Puja we have very limited number or very selected people, you know. And sixty-five. Can you believe it? Geneva itself. Then Lausanne, it's all separate. You can imagine? They are so sluggish, these people. Very sluggish. They are seekers no doubt. Very sluggish seekers. Moreover they are attacked, so much, so much attacked. And this left sided attack is so much. My thing was so full of it, I tell you. When I came all My this foot it didn't allow Me to walk. It was so caught up all this left side. So many things like that are happening in Brighton, I think. And the whole left is absolutely caught up. It started from, of course, Victoria. But here when I got down, this is the problem, really stumbling the left. Mother, in university we had so many false gurus, and there are some brothers that followed them, who [managed] the things and who tried to get... Now they have run away, all of their students. Well there are buddhists in the campus and [unclear] to get it. They'll take them to Shambala. Buddhists. And then they are taking tea among Life Poet whole center. [There is tea guy?] Yes. And Life Poet. Life Poet, Mother, it's an offshoot of that Raktabija fellow. What are [they doing]? They've got some guru that they send in the East or somewhere, of Malayesia... His name is Klaus or something. What did you say? I didn't hear... He is, he is, I think he is named like Derek Klaus or something... Derek what? He's Herbert, Herbert Job. So however he's called Mother, he's horrid. Herbert Job. She's like Olympia, see. From very childhood Olympia was like this. You are hungry. It's good. So all these are taking you know, a [deed] from Indians. They think why not we also have an enterprise, you see. But I was told that in England people don't take Indian people very seriously. I'm sorry, I can't give you this. You don't have teeth to eat that. Gregoire was saying that, what we should do. We should get Indian Sahaja Yogis for England. We should send English Sahaja Yogis for India. It's like that. What's this? You can just put it that way. No, I use the hands sometimes, see. This? A little. Whatever you may say, you see, so whatever goes on like that. But serious Sahaja Yogis we get, is better than to have too many. They are much better. Have serious Sahaja Yogis who get into it, who settle down, than to have too many people in the program. We had so many before also, you see. All sorts of things. How many came out of that? Cause in any case even if you get hundreds, out of that only, say, you will get about ten. So why not have the ten? That's real economics, here. That's real economics. Yes, it's real economics is. So what's the use? I'm wasting your energy with them. You see, they are so many, so you waste more energy with them. And they are all useless. Can't take them anywhere. So what's the use of fighting with them, useless people. And their Kundalini rising after ten years, like a mountain to raise they've given us. But not in India. In India it's very good. I mean if there are hundred persons at least ninety will turn right. But if I have it here, ten. This is the proportion. That's why in India it is growing like that. Every time, even if I go to them or not. I find about fifty, sixty people, like that. Every time, can you imagine? In Bombay, of course, much more. Bombay has got I think seven or eight centers all together. In the Bombay city itself, very well running. Which is so much so, that now, for the program we had, My birthday program, we had and the big hall was having about twelve hudred to fifteen hundred people. It was so filled that outside when I did arrive, that they asked Me to arrive little later, I couldn't go in. It was, people had to push side. And when My brothers came little later, they said, "We just didn't know how are we going, to whom." Then one third they were, many more seniors ones, all were Sahaja Yogis practically. But we had invited about three to four hundred people extra. They all were there, on the first seat. And the Deputee Minister, Deputee Chief Minister was present there. But you won't know they have, you see, just like as you have here, Peter Shore and all that, they have very important leaders, you see. Communist Party, then we have one very extreme party called Shiv Sena, which is a fanatic party of Shivaji's, fanatic party. I mean I'd rather difficult I think to eat this one. It's not breaking. Would You like a knife Mother? [No, it's all right]. I'm not very good at all these things, I think. It's not breaking at all but I'll manage. Managed, managed, managed. [Hindi] And all these people, extremes, all kinds of extremes, then all kinds of these leaders, members of the Assembly and all that. some ministers, all have come, and sitting on the same platform, can you imagine, for My birthday. And the greatest position, you must have heard, in India, is pandit. [unclear] And he didn't take any money. He said, "For Mother's birthday I'm not going to take any money". That kind of an attitude sure you can't expect here. Of course not. But you'll be amazed, in India, how many days I've worked, you know. I started, say in 1970, may. Slowly everything grew. So, '71, '72, '73, '74, and you see now. Ten years have passed in Sahaja Yoga. Seekers are amazing. And in Bombay, I am there hardly for ten days. When I'll go, ten days, fifteen days, at the most. In Delhi about ten, fifteen days. In Maharashtra I was a month, at the most. So, you can imagine. And how many things, I mean not only on this land that we have Sahaja Yogis, but that government has given us land, people have given us land. So many things have happened in India. And I feel that India is the place where Sahaja Yoga will be really established. Besides I would like to be established more in London. But what can we do? How far can we go with these horrible people? The media is hopeless. And dr. Naveen Singh is the, is the president of the Great High Court, Royal High Court. He presided in Delhi. You must get his, you must get his tapes, you see. Why not write to somebody? We were at Bhopal and I wanted to talk to him. Tomorrow we'll try if we can get him on the phone. And the chief, I mean the Deputy Chief Minister, He spoke very highly about Sahaja Yoga. Here, what to do? Then maybe it needs some, a breakthrough, one or two prominent people getting Realization, recognizing You Mother. Maybe we need a breakthrough, some, one or two prominent people, getting Realization and recognizing You. [Hindi]. They are horrible. I meet them every day. They think they are perfect. I mean it's not even one or two, Mother? No, no, it's very impossible. Horrible. Horrible. This lord Hailsham was sitting next to Me in a dinner. And dr. Naveen Singh was next by him. Dr. Naveen told him, "This lady is a very famous, saint of area, with whom you are sitting." Immediately he said, "I'm also a very famous saint, like that". Imagine that, he got his ahamkara, in hindi. Stupid. And next day his wife fell from the horse and died. At eighty, eighty years of age. Imagine this mad woman eighty years. Such a mad modernism. Oh, his nick name is "Bonkers Hogg". Bonkers. Bonkers. Bonkers. Bonkers. Bonkers. Really? He's called Bonkers. That's all they say so. Really, I say that. Horrible. I mean he just said immediately, without anything in mind, without any humility. And dr. Naveen Singh, you know. He said, "This man is full of ego, Ahamkara". Just can't do it. What can you do? I've cured some very important people like this fellow, this one I've brought. He talks very highly of Me, you said. That Indian... Dr. [Athler]. He gave Me a book. But he said " I am an archetype also." Thank you. I don't know what all that is. Even Grant you see, he wrote letters after letters to Me, "Mother accept me as your disciple". And he gave of course an introduction to Don's book no doubt. But, he would not circulate the book, nothing. He would not send it to his people, nothing of the kind. He's so money minded. "So if I publish it, then I will." That means you came for the publishing. There is no genuineness left in people anymore. In India you'll be surprised [as well]. Part of it the money we paid, no doubt, we paid part of it. But part of it was given. They gave Me the paper free. Here was never [unclear] even if they think to Mother. Printing free. So many things they did free for Me. All this is Mother's why should She pay. They have no sense of saintliness left. This horrible thing like, "[unclear], I'm going to do that". I don't know how will you manage. But still we must not be so much in despair. You see, according to Me it's a great progress in England. Because after all these are not artificial, these are real things. So real diamonds are rare, isn't it? They have to. I never expected really, to be very frank, in the beginning that we'll have so many Sahaja Yogis in London. So I'm overjoyed, whatever it is. But you people should not feel depressed, at all. And if you see the other side of it, lots of things they are doing, like registration. You see, it is giving such a boost to us, because now Australians, are so slavish. They said, "If it is done in England we'll accept it here". Authonom. No problem. They'll not question anything, they'll not say anything. They'll just accept. Can you believe it? Thing like that. And I'm sure Americans may say the same. They'll not reason definitely. "Was done in England, then it's all right. England are always, English are always correct." And it is going to help also French. Do you know that? France is the liver. Some sort of a thing has happened in France. I think that's why I felt that this labourhood when it comes in, people will be threaten, that maybe tomorrow communism may come. They will turn more towards God. That's what I felt we should go for. The fear, you see. Psychological fear. Like, like in Russia, I've seen. To them to be Christian is good, you see, if they are martyrs. All stupid people, no doubt, I must say. I think, that I was wondering whom to vote of course. Let's see. Is Gavin going back tonight? Yes, Mother. What time? I think they went straight from the program. Then [they went already]. Yes, is rather cold. They told Me that. She would be back tomorrow itself, at the evening program. Who told You that? Christine? Gavin was very disappointed to them. They'll not pick the program. That's the way these people are, this way. So, what did they suggest then? Sorry Mother. To you about that advertisement. So Mother, they told me that You discussed it again and that it was best to leave it for the moment, for the day if the man from IPO was going to come. He'll maybe come on Tuesday. Yes, I told him that. There's no use use pursuing these people. They are not suspicious of the tasks. Among suspicions is the furniture polish and the [unclear] lacquer. I know it poisons [that apetite] in some televisions. That's all. Doesn't matter. Good, for that they'll have a big drama, no? Since you will crash. And then from a crashed thing, a big ice you know, from Himalaya, it will come from the bottom. And if it is serious then you must know it, this is what it is. So an idea is [unclear]. Today the people we've got, they are good people. I think they will all come round and settle down. Would be good idea. We should not feel disappointed and worried. It will be all right. Because I think mentally they understood Sahaja Yoga. And it's better to have really serious Sahaja Yogis. Or they give such a headache otherwise, isn't it? What has happened to Phil? Phil, who used to come in London. Who was working with the.... Phil, what about him? There is no news about him, Mother. He went to Scotland? Yes. And I think [he might be again in Brighton]. Nobody got some news so far. No, no, because you see he wanted to marry that girl, he wanted to marry some girl, there. Phil. He asked Me about her. I told him, "All right, go ahead". He stayed at Suzan's place first and all that. Somebody must find out about him. Maybe this girl has ruined him, I don't know. But he told Me, "Mother, she is... quite happy with Sahaja Yoga." I said, "All right, go and marry, don't worry. Nothing to worry. For us you can come anytime. We get you married." You must ask John what has happen? He wanted to marry very badly, no doubt. We couldn't get a Sahaja Yogini to marry him, whatever it was. Cause this girl, he said, is good, she is, he asked for permission. I said,"All right. If you think that she comes to Sahaja Yoga, its all right". Mother, help one yogi. There is a Sahaja Yogi in Edinburgh and... Where? There is someone in Edingburgh who comes across to Glasgow [time to time] to see John and Cathy. They said they've seen Flint looking ill. He doesn't live in very good condition. He seemed to be getting back to his old ways, when they saw him. Old man? They said he was, he didn't look very well. But what is his age? He is, must be twenty-two, twenty-three, not much older. I don't know I received a letter from an old man who stays in Scotland. And he has been to Sahaja Yoga center. He's trying. Nothing works out. He is doing footsoak and everything, I don't know from where he wrote to Me. But his health is not all right? This fellow's? No. These persons have seen Kingsley Flint. Is that Flint? Yes, they said that Flint looked ill, when they saw him. There is someone who comes from Edinburgh, to visit Glasgow, and they told John that they've seen Kingsley and apparentely he wasn't looking well, that he, he looked sick. Is it? That fellow told? Yes. We should ask John to go and have a look. Could be. And maybe he started taken to drugs. Possibly. I remarked the one, very sensible boy. I don't know after coming to Sahaja Yoga, and living with it for so many years, how can you go back to drugs? After knowing what it is done to you. But possibly, possibly. I'm sure they'll find out. And talk to John. But Gavin was telling Me that still, Scotland is to be worked out. It's not yet to be regarded as a Sahaja Yoga center. We'll have to work it out more, Gavin was saying. Gavin is from Scotland and he feels concerned, you know. Let's see. You see we wanted to start that organization to show how these gurus have harmed us and all that. But now it's not necessary, they are all finished, [back to the hell]. All the people who are sort of regarded as something in this country, are already believing in some things [and sort of]. Impossible to bring anyone near Sahaja Yoga. I'll tell you about Peter Shore. One day he was sitting next to Me in a dinner. He said, "You look very happy person". I said, "I am". He said, "I am not". He said. So the wife of Michael Foot was next to Me. He said, "Are you happy person?" She said, " Not at all, I'm a very unhappy person". "Look at Mrs. Srivastava, is a happy person. But I can't understand, She must be ignorant about world affairs". You see, the wife of Michael Foot, she said, "Must be. It's better to be ignorant, she says, so that at least you can be happy". And then they started discussing their miseries, both of them, and I didn't argue. And the Conservatives and all these, making fun of the Queen. And the party they had at the Queen, what happened and, all these, imagine. I think some calamity will [happen]. If, if, Labor comes in, they will, they will take to God. I mean [inter-injury], before becoming comunist, let us take to God. But they are also saying for instance that I've told them. He asked Me to whom to vote, and then I said, "You vote the [Comission] now". How can you decide with these three types of people. But at least that he has been really, Shirley and William have been sincere to ask. I've met her also, quite often. But this has started looking like [unclear] or so. They cheat. All right with [unclear], Mother. But it's wonderful you are doing... Is it a jasmin tea or? What tea is this? I think Mother, it is jasmin tea. It is jasmin tea. But today what was the situation with the younger boys who were on the left hand side? How do you find them? You were all there? The left hand side. Which ones, Mother? Those which are sitting on the left hand side or the younger people. You were there. Anyhow it's crucial for them Mother. How was there? One needs patience. Not the one needs patience? And the other one? The other one was [unclear]. Then he was all right. No? After some talk only this happened. He can if he wants. But how, what was his reaction? Positive I think. Positive. Because of them. He's a friend of mine, Mother. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. Really? Yeah. He didn't feel very much but he sees that there's something. But he could sort of see it. At the Agnya? But it's not then [unclear]. Ekadasha. [unclear] and a lot of that talks and [cheap things / cheatting]. How do you think? It depends, I mean... I think they are Catholics but I don't think he's some, I mean he's taken drugs but not much, I mean sort of thing. Drugs? He's a Catholic. There's a double reaction. It's a double action. Right side. Oh, he will be all right. He looks positive. They have found out a new place they were telling. Kevin, did you tell him that? Yes Mother. And tomorrow you... I don't [hear something]: book it, book it. Better, better book it immediately. Or tomorrow you go and do it. Or you have to pay somemoney there? Mother, I didn't book yet say in Laussane but we'll talk it out tomorrow, Mother. You better take some money with you, in any case. I'll take, I'll take some in case they needed [at earnest], Mother, so I could take it, in any case, but usually these places is telling to [unclear]. Yes, they do, little bit. Little bit they do, I don't know about this one particular but they do. How goes with Phil? What about him? It's very nice, you see. According to him there are hundred and eight, and so many can come in the camp, you see. So there is a camping ground or they'l give us some, what will they give for the camping? Pardon? There will be some tents? Another statement is, Mother, is that thirty-five eighty-two does include the camping ground, if we place our own tents. Means? Or, they will hire tents to us. Oh, I see. Those who want to sleep in the tents. That's good. and there will be accommodation for sixty to seventy people in rooms. [Only those people who could find place because they are really happy to have You staying with them]. All right. And what about hundred eight you have said? So, we have the people in rooms, then there are some outbuildings, being quite [unfurnished] but we can sleep on floor if we have sleeping beds, then, in this [courtyard], is the camping ground, the camping area. And they will lend us the, we, we can pay for the hire of the tents. It's still o.k. And food they will give for all of us, whatever is the number. Food... If we have a lot of children for instance, they will do separate service for children, then children will have food before the others. Ah, very good Mother that sounds. Sounds like it was made for us, Mother. I mean you are going to go in the children side or what? All right. And then? The best thing, Mother, is that when I phoned they said, "We are having an open day tomorrow". They haven't got an open day for years. That's the play. Also, you see, ask them if they will give food to all of us, together, if we pay them the same amount. My impression Mother was that this would be possible, though I suggested that we might cook one or two of our own meals, perhaps after the Puja. No, no, better, better let them do it. Because you see, why to waste your energy in cooking? O.k., we could do that. And moreover you see, tell them that we can pay fourteen to you but you give us tents and everything and we all can pay you fourteen, whatever you say. I'll do it. It's remarkable. It's a miracle to have this place. It comes to us, just like this, Mother. Yes, I told you that look out for something. And that is in Kent or Sussex? It's in Sussex, Mother. It is in, it's in nature somewhere. Yes, I got it. Where is it Paul? You see, you know your [unclear name] husband, is a, is a nephew of the Duke of Sussex. You know that? Mother, pardon? Your brother in law. But that's true Mother, yes. We had him for a dinner in Geneva. Mother I think, he's very positive. I don't know, [he seems] quite positive. Is he? Always. Always quiet. He's very much impressed that she has, you see, that Mahila has married an English man. He's very happy. But I thought that's the only solution by which he can be brought to Sahaja Yoga. Because he was very adamant, very adamanat to begin with. Also, so Mother, he's visited India. He went to a visit in India and he was visiting villages just around Pune, and sitting on those grounds, isn't it, eating and [unclear], that changed him a lot. That changed him? Yes, a lot. Good. That's a good thing. And where is the map? Where is the place, Paul? What's the name of the place? Name of the place? I thought it would be better, Mother, if it will be in Pulborough, an outdoor, if it will be in the countryside. No, no, it will be near Pulborough. Near [Codmore]? Oh, no, it's a... You have been there, anyone? Quite some, quite some old time, Mother. Time [helps], it's a, it's a first day. It is quiet there. Here's one of the most important talk of the day, really going to this place. Let's try to. [It could be too windy] for Waters field. Most Australians [are waiting]. And cold water because of... Yeah, Place is called Watersfield, residential center. Yeah, it's in the map. Have a look it's in this... It's in this area here, we are going there somewhere. And where are we? And we are here. And there, that's London. It's London, it's here. This is the motorway here. And the motorway to this place? All the way to these places, that takes you along the coast. And along into the country. Yes. It is here, you say? Here? It's in this area, here. Phil doesn't know exactly where it is, so today [we are going to do] something. So this is the way to London also. It's all very, very easy to get to. This is it. So it is nearer than Brighton, from London? Oh, yes, yes. It's about nearly [fourty km distance]. Twenty minutes, Mother. Ah, it is nearer, you see? It's higher, here, and this road goes like that, you see? And this goes to London there. And another road comes this way, so it's London all. Hmm, that's easier. Cause London is there. This is the [Crookhill] road beacause this has got the [unclear]. I don't know these [minor] roads here. What do you mean? What road is this? Is this [Waterloo Road]? No, no, no, that's a, that's very [minor] roads. That's a country roads. That's the, mid road here, is Mid Sussex road. This road goes all the way to the Sussex. And goes up to Salisbury. And [further] down there. It would be very easy to get to the camp. It's a, and there's a train station near going to... What train station is? I don't know, but there is sign there. Little, little [line with] golden edges. And place is in there, is in there because here is Petworth and it's a big park in Petworth with... Beautiful there. It's very good park, it's a big old house, and they have an enormous landscape park with a lot of animals running about there. And also with a lake, and as well as a lot to visit there. But this is another [unclear]? That's Petworth, it's a beautiful place with a park. But people don't train people there? So, they don't give it for conferences and things? No, no, it's a Trust here. It's a national Trust. This one. Now, we'll be here, say about this part. Yes, we'll be here. That's Pulborough, that's a railway name, stop of the train. So we should easy get to. If we have to go to London, what is this place is here? That's Guildford. That's... That's on the other side. Yes. And then, this is a motorway here that comes from the west country. And... But it's very to get to. I regularly go from here through this area to park, on that way. That side we'll go. Would, would You like to... This is straight forward. Yes, it's straight. Would You like to see the place tomorrow, next day? Let's see. It's better let them go and fix it up first of all, all right? We can take this road, you mean to say, straight, to London? Yes, I think that's London road. London is over here. This is a long way, but that is still longer, the motorway. This is, it's pretty large, it's the motorway, to London and then this, very fast road, so here we come to Brighton. This is quite a nice road too. Oh yes, it's way to London. We can go to London like that. Isn't it? Yes, this is a lovely part of the country. When Joan and I got married, we stayed in Petworth, in hotel, for the honeymoon and holiday. What about this place? What is this? That's Crawley. There's been meetings as well. Crawley, aha. I know Crawley. Crawley, you had some meetings? So how is it? Crawley was. We had some meetings Mother, for a while. We had meetings for about six moths Mother and many people came and at the end of six months there was one person established. Really? Yes. One. Really, one person? One, she is, if we can call her that way. Really terrible. What's the problem? You got [down]? Spiritualism, Mother. What? Spiritualism. You know, spiritualism is about the worst [tally] in Crawley, in England, before drugs. For Crawley? It's very lethargic. It's very lethargic place because everybody, thigs they do [take them] to the left, you know, they [don't care a straw], watch emotional television, and they take a lot of drugs, and they go into the pubs and that's about it. It's a very dull, uninteresting town. That's a spoilt place. And even though so many Indians are there who called Me twice? Indians are doing very well there. They called You, Mother? Ha, I was there twice for their Navaratri thing. They actually, that day it has worked but we couldn't stay in touch with them. The Indians are, it's very little response from them. And we are going to get in touch with them again. I think Peter will try to [unclear] to Covington. What did they say? They have never tried, Mother. They called Me twice. Since they are only interested in Me that's the trouble is. They want to call Me, they want Me to attend every time, but they don't want to do themselves anything. As if for them I am like a king sitting there, I should do nothing instead festivals, things, bless all of them and finished. This is typical Indian idea. In England. It's typical European idea, actually. Many, many Christians have that aproach to God, Mother. It's something they switch on, on Sunday, like a television. They switch it off on Monday for a week and then forget about it. It's like that only, stupid people get in. Now, they have invited us to the Sindhu center, you see, because they are having sort of a Havan and all that and they think Shri Mataji must come and place the occasion and all that. Finished.Then what? Then if they have a problem then they must come and see Me, and now on the second you see, three, four ladies from the High Commissioner, are going to come and see Me. Deputy High Commissioner [strives] a lot. So if they have any problem, they must come and tell Me, this is the problem, that solve our problem, or there is sickness, or anything, the child is like this, everything. But they are not going to get [to ascent], they are not going to get to anything, they are not going to become anything. It's only I am there so I will look after them, "we'll leave it to Mother, things to do, see I've got Your photograph, we do Puja,this, that". I said, "What about you getting into it?" That's the Indian style. And what to do? I just can't talk to them, you know. Same with these Crawley people. See, they wrote about Me in the newspaper, do you know, in the Times or something it had appeared? They wrote that She came, She cured us, we had great, great time there, All these things they wrote. But then also they don't want to go a little further. Ask her. That day she was there for that Crawley meeting? Yeah, [really] wonderful but... Gavin was there. Thousands. They listened to Me about Sahaja Yoga, this, that. They are so fanatic Indians, I've decided I'll never go to their Puja absolutely. Cut out. All fell, touched My feet, everything they did. But nobody is interested in Sahaja Yoga, in Realization. Can you imagine such a thing? They are so materialistic, you have no idea. They are worse than you people. They have come here to earn money, they think that if there is a saint here, a saint's, you see, blessings can give them more money, that's all. That's their idea. So, it's like all the gutters, you see, have been brought here like [rock of Gibraltar]. Ask [Jyoti], she will tell you. How can we change all their traditions, everything, I can't understand. They have become so horrid. And they have no esthetics nothing. Horrible. So much money oriented. Can't save them. For a while it's all right. But all the time, all the time, they want some sort of a money and eating thing like. I call them export and import. No higher things, nothing in their lives. That's why, you see, if you see Indians in India, if you see them you'll be shocked. The difference is so much. It's all there in India, all there. So when he told Me he's married an Indian I was rather worried, you see, that now, a Gujrathi Indian. But [Jyoti] is remarcable, remarcable. She's not at all and she is still [Indian]. How can you to something so much, to such an extent? I mean I just can't understand. Such a abusiveness. And look at that girl how she was rude. I mean Indians are normally never rude, you see. That's not done, it's not... To an elder also, leave alone a person like Me, but to an elder also they don't talk like that. You see... How old you are about? All right. That's the fact. The other day they are going to have this Puja in the Hindu center. Let's see. They want Me to talk on Sahaja Yoga. In London, Mother? In London? In London. It's Shri Mataji coming. It's Shri Mataji. Very nice. So it's Shri Mataji has to look after their children, look after everyone, look after our dogs, look after our things, purses, look after our buffalos in India. All right.
