[Radio Interviewer speaking in French.]

Shri Mataji: It is with every religion. [Yes], all of them. But not the believers; the people who originated the religion are the real people, but the believers diverted.

[Translation and question in French]

Shri Mataji: As I said, I won’t like to limit Myself as anything or describe Myself as anything. It is for you people to find out what I am.

[French]

Shri Mataji: Jesus Christ is a great incarnation of God’s power of love.

[French]

Shri Mataji: Because truth is one...

[French]

Shri Mataji: It’s described that the Holy Spirit has the cool breeze.

[French]

Shri Mataji: The experience that they talk of is from St. Paul.

[French]

Shri Mataji: The experience of the power of the Holy Spirit has to be a living power.

[French]

Shri Mataji: Now this technique is called as ‘Sahaja Yoga’.

[French] [missing part]

Shri Mataji: Means it is spontaneous.

[French]

Shri Mataji: Now, first of all let us see the collectivity of it.

[French]

Shri Mataji: They call Me Mother.

[French]

Shri Mataji: That’s what I am coming to.

[French]

Shri Mataji: And that possibility is given in all the religions and described in all the religions.

[French]

Note

This seems to be not a radio interview with Shri Mataji, but a radio interview with Sahaja Yogis (in French) which has some sentences by Shri Mataji (in English). Most of the interview consists of the yogis speaking French, with only a few sentences by Shri Mataji.
