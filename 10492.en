Dinner with and cooked by Shri Mataji, Burwood Ashram, Sydney, March 12, 1985

[Throughout the dinner, Shri Mataji and Sahaja Yogis are speaking in English, Marathi and Hindi. Shri Mataji repeats some statements in more than one language].

Shri Mataji: Warren, nine o clock come? We can go to the room? Warren?

Warren: Mother, we have spoken to the neighbours and some of them [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: All right. Be seated. Now today I am not going to give a lecture. I have already done the cooking part.

All of them are here? You mean the hundred and forty are here?

Not yet?

Warren: [UNCLEAR] gone to Melbourne.

Shri Mataji: Still, I have cooked for at least a hundred and forty people. So we can leave tomorrow.

Warren: Maybe they are all inside. Maybe they are all inside, Shri Mataji. There are a lot of people inside.

Shri Mataji: Is it?

Sahaja Yogi: Will you have some water, Shri Mataji? Some water?

Shri Mataji: Give Me the towel.

Sahaja Yogi: Will you have some water?

Shri Mataji: I will take this (a cold drink)...properly. It is all right.

Everything else is done. Please get that now. And sing.

Play that music now. Play it.

Sahaja Yogi: This is [UNCLEAR/album name] from Kabirdas.

[Song plays].

Shri Mataji: This I have heard.

Sahaja Yogi: This is [UNCLEAR/Satyajeet].

Shri Mataji: I know. I had only sent him.

[Song plays - “Kabira bole jab hum paida huen, Jag hase hum roye].

Shri Mataji: He is saying, when I was born, the whole world used to, the whole world used to cry and I was laughing.

Kabir is saying. He said, “We should do such good things in life that when we die, the whole world should cry. The whole world should cry. The whole world laughed and I cried when I was born. [UNCLEAR]. Do such work that when you die, [UNCLEAR/ the world cries].

(To a Sahaja Yogi): Amazing. Despite all the sweat, such a radiance has come on the face.

[Kabir’s Rang De Jhini Jhini plays. Shri Mataji is explaining the meaning of the song as it plays and also conversing with Sahaja Yogis].

He is describing the Being. This is “Jhini, Jhini”. I am, I have knit this sheet. This being is a sheet. Because he was a weaver.

Where is My shawl?

Sahaja Yogi: Shall I hold it?

Shri Mataji: And he is soaked in the name of Shri Rama. Look at My face. I am coming from the kitchen. Can you believe it?

Sahaja Yogi: It is beautiful, Mother. Beautiful.

Shri Mataji: Just thinking what is the matter. This is Mother’s love shining through.

Ask Manjeet to see the second rice also.

Sahaja Yogi: He’s done it.

Shri Mataji: All right. Look at that - how all the colour is over there.

Sahaja Yogi: It feels like daylight.

Shri Mataji: Eight chakras were used and five elements were used.

Charkha is what we use to take out the thread from the cotton.

Nine to ten days it took to weave the [UNCLEAR]. Ten months. Nine to ten months. And stupid people have spoilt it.

When my sheet was made and came to the house, was given to the person - “rangrezz” is the person who colours it; is the guru. Was given to a guru.

Seeking is a tradition in India.

So, are both the (types of) rice cooked?

Sahaja Yogi: Please see them. This is the first one and this is the second one.

Shri Mataji: This one is too soft. This other one came out well. First, serve this and then we will give the other one.

This one was soaked a little more. That is why it has broken.

Sahaja Yogi: This is the first one, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Yes, this is the first one. That is why it is not soaked for too long. This one was soaked more. That is why it has broken. I did not come to know. No issue. When taking it out, if you use a saucer, then it will not break. First, you give this one.

He says that after wearing that sheet which is coloured, you should not doubt your guru.

“Shanka” means doubt. The guru has given you for a short time. So don’t try to doubt the guru.

Stupid people have no discrimination. “Murakh” means stupid. They go on making it dirty and dirty and dirty. Everyday.

Even after realisation. After the guru has coloured it, stupid people do not take to it and go on dirtying it and dirtying it.

Dhruva, Prahlad and Sudama, the great saints have worn the same thing.

He is changing the raga; is desh raga.

[Singer is rendering the line in different ragas].

This is desh raga, melody.

Kedara; this is another melody.

Melody of Malkauns now.

“Chadariya” is the sheet. Sudama is the saint, the friend of Shri Krishna.

This is the right time for Malkauns. Right time.

Your rice will get cold. Yes? Please lay out the rice.

First, serve a little to Me and then start.

How has the photo gotten the red colour? I can’t imagine.

Let (the rice) be right there. Take it out from there in a saucer in portions into a big one.

Take it there, all right. Let them take it out from there.

It would have stayed hot, that is why I - all right, let it be. Take one there and let the other one remain.

No, the other one you can take it later on. Let it be hot.

This is the Holi as you know. Holi. This is the style, hori.

Basant is the spring; spring melody.

The fragrance is very good - rice.

Lalit. No, no, no this is bhairavi. I misheard. This is bhairavi.

Let them all take it. It will all become cold.

Warren: The girls are serving them.

Shri Mataji: In the plates?

Warren: Yes, they are distributing them.

Shri Mataji: He is mixing up. He is singing another bhajan. “Now I am leaving my mother’s house”. Means it is death time.

Should not get cold, that is the main point.

Warren: They are serving it quickly Mother. Yours is being served now.

Shri Mataji: Let them go and take it quickly, one by one.

Warren: They want to serve your first. They want to serve yours first.

Shri Mataji: Can you move out a little? Thank you.

Warren: Just let Mother see the picture.

Shri Mataji: Look at My colour. Can you believe it? After cooking, this is shameful.

Warren: Open the door slightly.

Shri Mataji: I think this is Mother’s love showing.

[Dinner is offered to Shri Mataji].

First of all to Me? This is the limit. I am the first. May God Bless You.

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Shri Bhagwati Sakshat Shri Adishakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Shri Mataji: Is this the first rice or the second?

Sahaja Yogi: The first.

Shri Mataji: Then how is it breaking? The first one you gave was not broken.

Sahaja Yogi: While serving it out...

Shri Mataji: No, no, not like that. That is the thing. That is where it has gone wrong. Take it out with a saucer, like this (showing a wide scooping gesture).

That is how they have done. Ruined it. Broke it all.

Has more of it broken? Was it all stirred?

Sahaja Yogi: No, not all.

Shri Mataji: Not all. Scoop it out with a saucer. Otherwise, the whole thing will be finished.

Warren: Take a little bit of pickle now.

Shri Mataji: It is not like rice now. It is broken. All broken.

I told him. Modi’s advice may not be working out.
It is done well. But the rice should be complete. You see, I...

Warren: They may not be experts.

Shri Mataji: You see, but the service, they must understand. Otherwise, the whole thing work is finished with that, you know.

[Shri Mataji takes the rice].

Good, well done.

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Shri Mataji: Now you all go and get it.

It is done well.

It should be taken out carefully, Modi. It should not break. Should not break.

[Sahaja Yogi brings another plate of rice].

Shri Mataji: Yes, now it is not broken? I am fine with this (rice already served). For others.

Sahaja Yogi: Please have some.

Shri Mataji: Give Me some. A little. Do it [UNCLEAR/like this]. Otherwise, it is useless. All right, now just serve it in the proper way. You are a clever man.

Now the rice is whole. The rice should be complete. All right.

Three or four more people should go to serve. At least three or four more people. For so many people, three or four, or more should go to serve.

Warren: Modi’s being so careful with the serving now, Mother. It is taking time.

Shri Mataji: It looks so beautiful now. Just see. Just see. Very beautiful.

Warren: Wonderful.

Shri Mataji: Warren, it is not at all hot. So you have to take some chillies if you want to feel (heat).

Warren: I was the one that said, “Put more in”, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Little bit of what you call black pepper is there. That you people don’t mind. Little black pepper is there.

Warren: You mean, we need more?

Shri Mataji: No, no. Just try, first of all.

[Dinner plates are served out to Sahaja Yogis].

As I was saying, let them serve, but two and three should go and get it. The thing is, by that time she’s brought it and gone back - why don’t you go? Robert, you go. Just see.

Beautiful. Good? James, you didn’t tell Me.

James: It is wonderful, Mother.

Sahaja Yogi: This really is something Mother. It is a totally different flavour to anything I have ever tasted.

Shri Mataji: The flavour is hidden in it. But I didn’t do anything. I just told you how to do it.

The chillies are not there, but it is what you call garam masala. Is it hot for you?

Sahaja Yogi: No, no. Not at all. It is very flavoursome. It is not at all oil either. Not heavy.

Sahaja Yogi: Got your [UNCLEAR/programs], Mother. It is a triumph, Mother. A triumph.

Shri Mataji: Triumph.

Sahaja Yogi: Shall I take the mike back?

Shri Mataji: Yes. Have you eaten? Then you should have dinner. Have the food. These are all those who are the cooks.

Come on, have dinner. Go and eat.

Sahaja Yogi: What is the problem?

Shri Mataji: No, he said the mike is coming (in the way). I said, “You are the cook. Why don’t you eat something?”. He was one of the cooks.

You add some chillies to it. Add some chillies for yourself. It is not at all spicy.

Sahaja Yogi: You have eaten?

Shri Mataji: I eat very little.

That is good. Dahi (curd) is good.

Sahaja Yogi: It is very tasty. It is sweet.

Shri Mataji: Yes, I put some honey. That kills the - we had used the cream, sour, for the throat also.

Sahaja Yogi: It is really something.

Shri Mataji: I will see how much you eat. Then I will believe it.

Dina has worked very hard. All the girls have worked very hard.

In one of the names, where Markandeya described Me, he has said - Warren? Markandeya, he has said that Mother is fond of fried rice, fried rice - pulao. He has described as that.

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR/Mike].

Shri Mataji: No, no let it be. I am just talking to you.

You didn’t have anything, the little thing. First, give it to the little baby first.

Sahaja Yogi: They are the ones to be served first.

Shri Mataji: They are so sweet and quiet visitors.

Career Sahaja Yoginis.

The first one is over?

Sahaja Yogi: Must be. I never, I never, had seconds but today I think I will.

Shri Mataji: You should.

Is it hot for children? Little. Little hot. Not hot?

You must take out the black pepper. Then you won’t feel it. If there is.

For children, I was telling.

Why didn’t you have, Robert?

Robert: It is coming.

Shri Mataji: And the meat is very good too. You must thank Manjeet very much. For getting everything. Such an asset he is.

Now you have learnt how to make this pulao; next time you must make it.

Sahaja Yogi: This is the way to do it. This is the way to eat. Just sit back and help yourself.

Shri Mataji: I know one thing; is cooking. Go, bring some more for Warren.

Have you given Modi or not?

Sahaja Yogini: I am serving him.

Shri Mataji: Tell him to take the rice without the meat.

The meat was very good. Very good meat.

(To Sahaja Yogis): How are you? All happy with this?

Sahaja Yogini: Beautiful. Thank You, Mother.

Sahaja Yogi: Be careful with the mike.

Shri Mataji: Every good mother must know how to cook, isn’t it? That is one of the motherly qualities.

Everyone has got it (dinner)?

Warren, have some.

Warren: It is coming Mother. It is coming.

Shri Mataji: Manjeet, you please have it.

Warren: There is another piece on my plate.

Shri Mataji: This Manjeet has worked very hard. Micheal and everyone but, the way he has selected good things, you know - the meat was very good.

How is it, Modi? Good. You (Manjeet) should have it at least. It is your hard work.

What is it?

Sahaja Yogi: Too hot for him, Mother.

Shri Mataji: What is?

Other Sahaja Yogi: No, not too hot, [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Everybody is enjoying.

Won’t you eat something? You have something to eat. These girls are serving now. Those who have finished should go and help. They should help.

James should have some more.

(To a Sahaja Yogini who is serving): Yes, very nice. Get some for James and then you also have some. Now they can serve themselves, you set it in a plate.

Today no dieting.

Sahaja Yogini: It was very good [UNCLEAR/to cook].

Shri Mataji: Now you have learned how to cook it, no?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Have some more. Now those girls who are serving should take it first. Then others will take it.

How is Bill? Good? You have helped a lot also.

[Manjeet offers more rice].

Shri Mataji: Arre baba. I never eat too much rice. You eat, son. You have not eaten yet.

You ate? Tasted it? No, you taste it, that is it. Eat now. Relax and eat.

Take this (plate). I don’t want it.

No, no, Modi. It is not possible for Me, not possible. You know that I never eat so much rice.

No, no, not at all possible. Impossible.

Everything has spilled, also in yours. I dropped everything. All right.

All right. How is the rice?

Warren: I never had a second course.

Shri Mataji: No, no, this Warren, this rice no, it looks so simple. It is not so simple. It makes you hungry.

(To Manjeet): You better eat. You have cooked, you are eating, eat first. Sit and eat. Take this ras (gravy). It is hot. Take this hot one. His (serving) has become cold. So you eat. No, enough.

I never eat so much rice; not in all My life - ate it today.

To a little girl: You found it hot?

Little girl: No.

Shri Mataji: No? You found it hot?

Little boy: A little.

Shri Mataji: Hot in what? The rice?

Little boy: Yes.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR/So see], you just remove the black one in that and then it won’t be.

All right? It is the black chillies. Black pepper. You remove and then it will not be hot.

Then it is all right.

For Indians this chutney is good. You have it. Please take it. Vijay.

For Indians. You have it. You have it. It has a lot of chillies. How is it?

Come, come, have a little. It is good.

How is the pulao?

[Camera is panning over the Sahaja Yogis having dinner].

Shri Mataji: You must move the light with that. Otherwise, nothing is seen.

Sahaja Yogi: Would you do the panning again, with the light?

Shri Mataji: It is looking like a royal meal. I tell you.

Was it sufficient? It was not short?

Sahaja Yogi: There is a lot still, Mataji, quite a lot.

The second pot is still nearly full.

Shri Mataji: Please have some more. A little bit; you can wait and go.

Just go and have. Please, please, please, all of you.

Warren: You can go and get your own now. Go and get your own.

Shri Mataji: Go on, go on. That’s nice boys. There is such a lot there.

See I have cooked for two hundred and forty and twenty have gone away.

So please will you have now?

No, no, no, no. First of all - what about Jenny, you didn’t have anything. She didn’t eat. Now make her.

Who are the people who have not taken anything at all? Better go and have. You have been doing everything. Come along.

Now, you and Bina. She too. Did you eat anything?

Go. You and, you and, go. You should have it again. Jo, go.

Mathur’s daughter; she is also all the time serving. Now go and have.

You are having second help; now go and have. Please, those who are serving, first have.

Nobody should feel shy. Go and get it. A little bit more. We can manage.

Good, good, that’s a good girl.

Is it good?

Sahaja Yogi: It is wonderful, Mataji.

Shri Mataji: It has come out well. Now you should make it. You people have understood it.

One should know the judgment of it, of making it.

Sahaja Yogi: We got the measure of it.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that is the thing.

Warren, please see those girls who were serving, please see they have the food first.

Warren: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Please see those who were serving.

Warren: I am seeing to now, Mother.

Any of the ladies who haven’t eaten, please make sure you get some yourself.

Any ladies still not eaten? Please come and get your food.

Mathur’s daughter, have you taken?

Warren: Yes she’s got it, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Take a lot.

Warren: Service, cooks everybody.

Shri Mataji: You didn’t take everything. Dahi, dahi have you taken?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Warren: Yes, they have got everything.

Mother, may I take your plate?

Shri Mataji: Yes, please. Thank you.

How is it? Good?

The first one was better because the rice broke in this one. That was the only thing, nothing else. The rice was soaked. I thought the rice was added. Don’t soak it. I had said that when the water starts boiling, it should be washed at that time. That is its principle.

The estimate of water is slightly less than double.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Slightly less. And even then, if you have the judgment, and the water falls short, you can still cook it. It is a matter of judgment. Now there was so much water taken out of it, even then it is cooked properly.

[Unclear comment by Sahaja Yogi].

Shri Mataji: Please, please.

Good?

It was quite timely, I think. It got done in time.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Were the vegetables sufficient? They did not fall short?

Was the curry sufficient?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji. There is still some more.

Shri Mataji: It is there?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Seconds.

Shri Mataji: If you keep it in the freezer, then it can be eaten in the morning also. It is very nice. Kept overnight, it will be even better when heated.

Sahaja Yogi: More than half the pot is left. There is more than half in the pot.

Shri Mataji: They are still eating. So let it be. We will keep it. It can be taken out in a small pot and we can keep it in the freezer. Only in the freezer. In the fridge.

Warren (to cameraman): Can you walk that way?

Shri Mataji: Very good. The film has come out very well.

Sahaja Yogi: Beautiful, Shri Mataji. It is a lovely setting here.

Shri Mataji: Somehow the whole thing is looking very nice. Show all these. It is very nice.

[Camera pans over the overhanging bushes and trees covering the garden and patio].

Outside would have been difficult.

(To a Sahaja Yogini): You are just chewing through it very slowly. Eat quickly.

(To another Sahaja Yogini): Have some more.

Sahaja Yogini: Thank You.

Shri Mataji: Please have some more. Ben, you liked it?

Ben: Very good, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Next time, I will make some kebabs for you. Melbourne I can make something nice.

[UNCLEAR comment by Sahaja Yogi].

Shri Mataji: How was that?

Sahaja Yogi: Thank you for cooking for us, Mother.

Shri Mataji (to someone carrying the plates): Don’t take it all at once.

Warren: There is one flower there, Mother. It only blooms once a year.

(To a Sahaja Yogi): Bring it down.

It only blooms in spring, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Warren (to Sahaja Yogi): No, no not all of it. Just a little bit.

Shri Mataji: What is that?

Warren: It is some sort of South American trumpet flower. South American Mexican trumpet flower.

[Sahaja Yogi presents the flower to Shri Mataji].

Shri Mataji: It only blooms in the?

Sahaja Yogi: Only in the spring Mother. It only ever blooms in the spring.

Shri Mataji: It is there. Beautiful.

Sahaja Yogi: Spring has, spring has arrived today.

Shri Mataji: Nature understands better.

But the best part is the camera, I think. I look as if I have painted My face. With some colour. Isn’t it? As if I have really put some big make-up on My face. I am coming from the kitchen directly. I can’t understand.

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR] in Mother’s face.

Shri Mataji: Go and have some more. Please have some more. Come along. Kate. You have eaten very little. Go, you worked so hard. You all have worked very hard. Come along.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother it’s Your face.

Shri Mataji: Look at that. Can you believe it?

Sahaja Yogi: Beautiful. Beautiful.

[Shri Mataji looks intensely at the photo and smiles].

Shri Mataji: It’s too much. Can’t believe it. Feel shy, the way it is. I can’t understand. I have not washed My face, nothing. It’s all red showing all over. From where do I get it? I just don’t know.

Isn’t it surprising? It is the Mother’s love you know. Kind of a light. She is feeding you so She feeling happy, I think.

That’s the love showing on My face. Just I can’t understand.

This we call it as “abha” (aura, lustre). Abha.

[Sounds of taal (hand cymbals) used in Abhangas start in the background].

Shri Mataji: Who is doing that?

Sahaja Yogi: It is from Maharashtra.

[Music player is playing a Marathi bhajan chant “Ram Krishna Hari”, commonly played in village temples. Camera zooms on Manjeet].

Shri Mataji: Get Manjeet also. Those who worked today, get them in the photo. Modi, come here. Yes. Come.

All those who worked today, very hard, come here. Sumi(?) and where is she? Bina, Bina, I have not seen you eating. Did you eat?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: True? How was it? Come sit, sit.

[Sahaja Yogis come and sit near Shri Mataji’s feet].

I enjoyed today. I am feeling content today. Did you see My face?

Modi: [UNCLEAR]. I was standing behind and watching. Such wonderful colours. There is an extraordinary lustre.

Shri Mataji: The shine? I cannot understand.

Modi: These colours will never go from memory.

Shri Mataji: Manjeet. Take Manjeet and take these people. All of them have worked very hard.

Warren: He is too shy, Mother. He won’t move.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, Warren’s worked very hard. Warren should be here. He’s worked very hard.

Shri Mataji: Warren’s, we have taken his photograph. And all others you see. Also, where is Michael gone? He’s worked very hard. And Bill? Where is Michael?

Modi: Which Michael? Which Michael, I said.

Manjeet: Michael’s name is Michael Sweet.

Shri Mataji: Michael Sweet. All right. Where is he gone?

Did you eat anything, Michael?

Michael: Yes, I did.

Shri Mataji: How was My cooking?

Michael: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Come here. Sit there. How was that?

Michael: Beautiful, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Really? So I am also a chef.

[Sahaja Yogis laugh and clap].

Yes, I can teach you many things. One by one. If you want.

[Looking at the flower]. This is exactly like the Kundalini.

Modi: Exactly. Flowering outside and [UNCLEAR/umbrella] inside.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, Thelma’s been working hard in flowers too.

Shri Mataji: Where is she? Thelma? Come along.

Did you eat well?

Thelma: Yes Mother.

Shri Mataji: How was that? Have you done something?

Sahaja Yogi: Look at this all [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Was good?

Vijay worked hard.

Sahaja Yogi: Vijay worked very hard. Where is Vijay? Vijay.

Shri Mataji: Now, how they are playing it. I was teaching you how to do it.

Come along. Did you eat at all or have you been doing that? Sit down, sit down.

Have you eaten? Everybody has had because if everybody was helping, it would have been spoilt.

They can’t manage to do it in our style (Indian taal with hands). This method is not easy for them. In that taal.

Sahaja Yogi: Even at our place, not everyone is able to do it. Not everyone can manage to do it. It has to be arranged for them.

Shri Mataji: It is easy work.

I today feel very satisfied, because I could cook for you and that you liked the food.

Feel very happy. Tushti (content) today. Tushti.

Modi: Not just tushti, pushti (confirmation) also. After tushti, pushti also.

Shri Mataji: What is it? Which song is it?

Modi: It is a bhajan. It is not our Sahaja Yoga bhajan; another one a commercial one.

Shri Mataji (to Sahaja Yoginis): What, are you eating or nibbling? Eat properly. You are eating like sparrows.

(To another Sahaja Yogini): Did you finish eating?

Sahaja Yogini: I was there [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: You were eating and you left it and came? Go and finish it. I feel it looking at your face. Go. Finish eating and come. Go, go, get up. Go. Her face had that look, that is why I asked.

She didn’t eat complete, you see. So I could see from her face, she has not had.

[Sahaja Yogini has brought her plate].

Bring it hot. Bring it hot. Go and bring something hot.

Modi: The masalas should be put in within a “potli” (knotted bundle) - even we did not know that.

Shri Mataji: You can use it again. If you keep the potli in a fridge or a freezer, you can use it again. That potli, that thing we have made - you can keep it in the freezer, again you can use it.

To boil it in water. The rice can be put in with it again. Now it will not be as good, but there will still be something in it.

[A Sahaja Yogi clicks a picture from behind the group].

Sahaja Yogi: Man, I didn’t know you were taking the photograph.
Shri Mataji: You are caught there.

Sahaja Yogi: You are on TV.

Shri Mataji (to Sahaja Yoginis): Go, go, go and eat a little more. Go.

You are eating just like a sparrow.

All right, go. Go and have some more. Come along.

Give some more to Manjeet. Manjeet, a little more. Just a little.

Go and get some, Modi. Vijay, you get some. Give it to Vijay.

No, sit. He is the younger brother, he will bring it.

[Bhajan plays].

Shri Mataji: Who is this one?

Modi: (Anup) Jalota’s tapes. This one, Vijay has brought them.

Shri Mataji: This is Jalota’s son.

Did you eat well? Did you eat sufficient? Really? I have tired you out completely, I think. You are looking tired with that work.

How is it? Coming up well?

[UNCLEAR response by Sahaja Yogini].

Shri Mataji: Worked out.

Sahaja Yogini: [UNCLEAR] worked out. There is something that I want to show you.

Modi: When we were doing programs at Nath temple in Khar, he was just this little.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Modi: This Anup Jalota. This father has performed before us.

Shri Mataji: He not only sang, but I also sent these two. No, no, I sent these two there. There, to Africa. They went only because of Me and both of them earned a name. For free. And by getting paid as well.

Did you take it? Have some more. Is it finished?

Vijay? The rice I was saying, you can keep it in the fridge. Tomorrow, you can eat it. It is quite good.

Sahaja Yogi: It will be beautiful tomorrow, Mother. Excuse me, Mother, I better [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: It is better to eat the next day.

Modi: It would not have been a problem to give it to the people who have come here to pack and take it away.

Shri Mataji: They are all here.

Modi: They are here, but they can still take some home. Packed boxes.

Shri Mataji: They will come and eat tomorrow. There won’t be so much.

We did not get “mukhwas” (after dinner mints).

Modi: It is there here.

Shri Mataji: It is?

Modi: [UNCLEAR] is giving out.

Shri Mataji: All right.

Modi: I will see and get it.

Shri Mataji: For you, one day I will make kebabs. Kebab. Here. Sham-e-kebab and sheekh-kabab, I make both of them very well.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Don’t know where now; Melbourne perhaps.

I make very good kheema. Very easily too. Many things, all things in fact. Such as dahi vada is there, chhole is there, biryani is there.

(Listening to the music): Our Baba has this record. He had given it to play in our car. My own brother, he had given this tape.

Sahaja Yogi: I will give a copy of this to Warren, for everyone. If they would like to listen to it sometime.

Shri Mataji: All right.

[Shri Mataji looks intently at the camera].

Shri Mataji: Does this zoom at the distance also? Does it go nearer the distance? This thing?

Does it go closer to the person? Does it?

[Camera zooms into Shri Mataji’s close up].

Shri Mataji (smiling): Yes. Very much so. Yes. That is what I was wondering.

Comes very close I must say.

[Camera zooms to Manjeet who is eating, seated near Shri Mataji].

Shri Mataji: You are blushing. He is feeling shy.

[Camera zooms to Sahaja Yogini next to Manjeet[].

So what is it? You have taken too [UNCLEAR].

Such nice, holy feelings of brothers and sisters. It’s beautiful.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. We are learning that [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: You just don’t have that anymore left. So innocent, so beautiful.

Sahaja Yogi: It is lacking in the West so much, Mother.

Shri Mataji: But it is working out through you people, I tell you.

Have somebody written to this newspaper fellow also? No?

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR]. They are doing it.

Shri Mataji (to Manjeet): Eat it somehow. Finish it. He is trying. No problem at all. Relax and eat. Finish it.

He is finding it difficult. [UNCLEAR/pushing it down].

Manjeet: It has come out very well.

Shri Mataji: It has come out well. It is very well done, I say. You can eat it. This rice you can eat a lot because it is not very heavy. It is not very heavy and it has a taste which makes you feel more hungry, I think.

You can eat quite a lot of it. Two plates, easily.

In My house, in My father’s house, we had such a big thing (showing with arms spread). I used to make it. We had a big thing. You see, the whole traditional family; that we picked up such a big thing. The first day everybody would have their food and the next day everybody would send their tiffin carriers - to have the remaining.

One should learn real Mughlai cooking in all this. The one that we eat in U.P. (Uttar Pradesh state); that is the one eaten particularly.

And the second thing; the prawns that you had made. The curry of prawns; I will tell you that also; I will have it written down - how to make it; an excellent one.

And it is about how well masala is roasted; that is all. The masala must be roasted well. That is the special thing in our Indian cooking - the masala should be roasted; it should not be raw.

You see, Indian cooking has only one problem. You must know how to fry the masala. There should be no raw feeling as you saw that. There’s raw (masala); then it is finished. It is that, really, that’s (a) very important part.

[UNCLEAR comment by Sahaja Yogi].

Shri Mataji: Here we did it, yes.

Modi: It should become ”khamang” (aromatic flavour of spices).

Shri Mataji: Yes, khamang. Moreover, certain things we use like haldi (turmeric). So you see, haldi has to be done very well. Before anything else. Otherwise, it can make the food quite bitter.
See all these things are - this is to be learnt; that’s what it is, Indian food is.

Even if I give you the recipe, it may not come out - unless and until I show you how to do it. Because you see, Western cooking is very systematic, I think. There is not much of a - I mean you do not go on much of, seeing, smelling.

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Yes, it is not so much, yes. Simple.

My daughters picked up Chinese very well. They picked up Western food very well. But certain things like pulao they say, “Mother, we can’t make like you”. Then kebab. They say, “I can’t make”.Many things they say they just can’t - kheema. Another thing. Her husband is very fond of minced meat I make. So she says, “I can’t make like my Mother”. Even chholes. See, certain things you - like karele (bitter gourd), this and that. Bhindi (okra), dudhi (bottle gourd), all these things. It becomes a habit through cooking again and again.

I was always very fond of cooking. So see, when you are fond of cooking, you do all kinds of experiments also. See, whatever is there in the house, you have to cook. So today we could not get the black jeera (cumin). That is important, but we never missed it. Never missed it in this.

So whatever is in the house, you must know how to cook. That is how you experiment and you get good results. But you must actually have the full judgement about the taste of a particular thing. How much will it be?

Now, this say, we had this dahi, what you call yoghurt. Now we wanted to put some thick cream. We did not have so we put some sour cream. So it was a little sour. So we put some honey. Then honey was all right. But I felt there is (a) little bit of not up to the point. So I said, “Have you got cashew nuts?”. “No”. I said, “ Have you got anything else?”. They said, what did you have?

Sahaja Yogini: Walnuts.

Shri Mataji: Walnuts. So we just powdered it a little bit and put it. It tastes very well. It just kills that sourness. It is very simple.

But you must know what is needed in this and that. But in English food, it is not like that. It is so precise. If you have to make the cake, you weigh it, put it so much; the cake is there. But I think the finest cakes, the best-known cakes - they must be done by some individuals only. They must be having those secrets with them.

Because it is all right to make a general cake like that. But to make a very fine quality cake; I am sure there must be a very individual thing. Isn’t it?

Sahaja Yogi: In a lot of European food, they make the dish and then they taste it. If it is fine.

Shri Mataji: That is how it is. At least for salt, we have to taste. Because everywhere I find salt is very different. Indian salt I find is very different from English salt. English chillies are very hot, surprisingly, very hot. And the salt is no good. Go on pouring salt. God knows what it is.

I don’t know why Indian salt - maybe, I don’t know, maybe - the sea is not very happy with them. I don’t know. Salt is absolutely without - there is no salt in it. God knows what happens to the salt in England. This is better salt you have.

And the chillies in England are so sharp chillies. Here they are not so. I put twenty chillies - each pot, twenty chillies. But twenty chillies for ten, ten kilos. But the chillies were dissolved. You never saw them anywhere.

But didn’t feel that much. Twenty chillies for ten kilos.

At home when I cook, I don’t have so many people to help Me. Only one servant or two servants; I do most of it. Myself. But you see, they are experts now. So they do everything, everything ready and I have to go and (do) a little bit.

But despite the fact that the water was falling off and the pots were a little small - see when you cook in two places, it happens like that. It is all right. Everybody enjoyed.

So thank you very much. All of you. May God Bless You.

Today I am really feeling satisfied.

Whenever I have a chance to cook, you must allow Me to. I am very happy to cook.

[Applause].

I actually love to cook. Really, I love it. Enjoy it very much.

And I have no tension, nothing. I just do it with great pleasure.

You must have seen that I have great pleasure. There is no tension at all.

(To a Sahaja Yogi): Ready to go?

I will take your leave, Warren. May God Bless You.

Warren: Thank You, Mother, for coming. It is a beautiful day and what more could we ask for.

Shri Mataji: You gave Me a lot of rest today.

[Shri Mataji gets up to leave].

(To everyone): All right, good night.

Sahaja Yogis: Good night.

[Shri Mataji departs from the garden. Sahaja Yogis are still at the venue].
