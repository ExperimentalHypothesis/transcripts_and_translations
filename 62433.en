Interview, Moscow Russia 1990-06-26 

Shri Mataji:..All right. And the brain you see, was damaged I think by seeing this film of this man.

Shri Mataji: They told me so.

Interviewer: This [there] anyway the people can find themselves, they will not be turned by storm of light from one side to another side of the river called life? And can we give to person the truth?

Shri Mataji: Of course, why not. They are the best Russians, are the best people for this. And she thinks but the problems are not so much as they are otherwise but they are very aware.

Interviewer: I would like to ask you, we live in a very difficult time in Soviet Union and what do you think our society is very thick or it has any chance to become cured?

Shri Mataji: It is the best society I have ever seen. Because perhaps of the difficulties they think they are more anxious to get to truth. And if they, when they are blessed by spiritual power they will be the strongest nation in the whole world. You are, you cannot be strong by what war weapons you have but you are strong by what powerful human beings you are.

Because money can create problems, power can create problems and also these attractions for physical pleasures all are punishable and create problems.

Interviewer:...From the point of view of [UNCLEAR] development we are at the lowest point and the point of being beggars.

Shri Mataji: Is he forgetting the spiritual point, the ability that you need? That's what you have and that's how you are going to get it. It's not begging, it is humility which is very important.

Interviewer: Can you tell us please, you help a lot of people from where do you take this power, so much suffering exists in this world. How do you, from where do you get this power to help those people?

Shri Mataji: As you have that power and when it is awakened it is all-pervading, all the time you can take it, it is eternal it goes on flowing in Me.

Shri Mataji: And it knows that I'm doing good work so it helps Me all the time, no doubt!

Interviewer: ...Bad things are very powerful and they always exist in this world. How can we fight this power?

Shri Mataji: Because we have never used the power of love. We have always used the power of hatred and now is the time for you to take to love. Once it starts working you will believe in it.

Interviewer:...Part of the spiritual game that is going on in the world. They are so-called gurus and extra senses in all kinds of false monsters in all. What do you think about them?

Shri Mataji: You should be very careful, you are intelligent people, you should know that, if they take money, if they are money oriented and what affects the [UNCLEAR]. You see there are lots of them will be coming to Russia but be very careful. You have to understand that they should only give you self realisation and nothing else.

Interviewer:...Sahaja yoga in Soviet Union?

Shri Mataji: First of all, you have to get some experts from other countries here  and you must make arrangements for their stay and living so that they can go to different cities and help you and make you experts and then you should try to spread Sahaja Yoga, it's the best way.

Shri Mataji: Come to India to learn about Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Find out people who are genuine. Who are interested in Sahaja Yoga because, you see, sometimes they can be money oriented, they can be power oriented these people. Also I would like to come and stay in Russia for some time. But if you see my schedule it is so busy. I'm travelling everyday like that but maybe if I get some time I could be here for ten, fifteen days together and I can teach.

Shri Mataji talking to Gregoire.

Shri Mataji: No main thing is, whatever it is. You see by [UNCLEAR] very humble. You see, I've never seen such an interview in the whole of my entire life. They are so humble. You see the thing they see before is a great spiritual master, they are so humble. You can see that maturity. They are like beggars of spirituality [UNCLEAR]. All right, let's see what are these? Lets take out your shoes my child and also your socks.
