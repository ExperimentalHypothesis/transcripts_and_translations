Evening before Sahasrara puja. Thredbo (Australia), 2 May 1987.

[Talk after singing (not on video).]

So very nice to see you all here, all My children. Your love outbeats Me. I really find no words to express My feelings. The way you have taken to Sahaja Yoga and the way you have established yourself in Sahaj Yog. I know it is very difficult to spread Sahaja Yoga. Everywhere it is difficult because you know these are the times of Kali Yuga. I am not tired of the journey so much as the fighting the evil forces around us. When I came to Canberra, I felt the Left Swadishthana very strong, so strong that I could not walk few steps, and I asked them what’s the matter and they told Me that TM, there is some Chinmoy fellow, they are very strong here. Apart from that there are other spiritualist courses which they are announcing in the newspapers. It’s shocking that human beings take to these horrible things so easily and try to work it out. When you study the reason why they take to these horrible things, then you realise one thing: that these things promise quick results. Like supposing somebody’s son has been lost. So, they will say, ‘All right. You come to our group, we’ll find it out for you.’ Or else, somebody says, ‘I am under a great strain.’ ‘All right, you come to our group, we will remove your strains.’ It’s very easy to remove the strains by putting an entity, what we call the bhoots, into someone so that the bhoot takes over for the time being. But, here the seeker is not a deep person. Those who were deep people came back from all these horrible people. With the TM, I can tell you, we have been able to salvage some people, not all of them.

When first it was brought to My notice, I had a meeting in England and we had from TM at least hundred people. Out of which, we can say about ten or twelve people we have been able to salvage. But the growth, spiritual growth in them was very slow and they were just frightened of Me. They would not look at Me. They had awe about Me. Whenever they saw Me they used to shake. There is one fellow, Chinese, who came from TM, and I think Rustom was there, and he just took My name and he jumped under a table and landed himself outside in the lounge and they started looking at him, where has he disappeared. [laughing] This Chinese fellow, we tried with him, but he used to shriek, and horrible he was, poor thing. Then he left Sahaja Yoga in a way and somebody met him – he was working in a restaurant or in a bookshop – and somebody met him there, and they asked him, ‘How do you feel? How do you feel about Mother?’ He said, ‘Oh! Ho, ho, ho! She is a tremendous power.’

So, you see, they are so weak, they are so gone down. It’s very difficult to bring them to normal conditions. Within two, three years they become recluses. They are even afraid of, what you call garlic. If you show them the garlic they start shaking. If you show them the lemon they start shaking. They become recluses. We get few people from there, TM, but their bhoots are so strong that they will not stick on to us much. Even if they come for a short time, again they go back. So, this is the situation with these TM people. And with this Chinmoy fellow, I had an encounter in America, and there the people they came and told Me that ‘Why this Chinmoy is here and why doesn’t Your husband tell the Secretary General about it?’ And you know who was the Secretary General that time, Waldheim and all the rest of it. And they were all crazy people – how Waldheim is now being treated by people; he is not allowed to go to America and all that. Actually his luck was not so bad but these bhoots, you see, they made him so funny that he just could not come back to his normal self.

Now this gentleman was not so much into this Chinmoy, but there was one south Indian gentleman who was in the UN and he said that, ‘This Chinmoy is very good.’ This Chinmoy used to play tennis, used to swim, used to drink, have women – he was a real Yankee, you see – and despite that, people said, ‘Oh, he is great because he knows how to speak well.’ So, all those speech-loving people he got. That’s another style of people who are not seekers but who just want somebody to talk, talk and talk. He could talk on Gita, he could talk on this, he could talk on every kind of thing. Now, the big difference is, in Sahaja Yoga you have to accept Me. There, you don’t have to accept anyone, as long as you accept Gita, as long as you accept Bible and as long as you accept something who is not there: who is dead, who is finished. So, these people are interested only in your money.

So, they don’t worry about these old, we should say, prophets who are dead now or we can say the incarnations who are dead. They have nothing to do. Just they describe them, take the money. That’s what they want. They only want to have money, money, money and money. They are not interested in your welfare or anything. They have no idea of Kundalini, they cannot raise your Kundalini, they cannot give you realisation, they cannot look after you – nothing of the kind. Only thing what they want, whatever money you have, they should have it. And the way they do it is a very camouflage sort of a drama they play, that they can deliver the goods. What are the goods they are going to deliver to you? Except Self-Realisation. Even the people who talked of Self-Realisation never gave Self-Realisation to anyone. I have seen this Yogananda’s disciples, the early ones, they had to cut their tongue because according to him, in his own Kriya Yoga, you had to put back your tongue here for a khechri and that’s why they had to cut their tongues. They cannot speak, they cannot do anything. They are just like dogs, you see, wagging their tails. Very good people – they are doctors, architects: very good people. All these things have happened to all these great seekers, I should say, but they were stupid to accept anyone like that. First of all, you must see what are others, others are doing; other, say, disciples are doing. How are they, majority of them? In Sahaja Yoga also, we might get somebody, a very useless person and we might get somebody, a very low grade or a very low calibre personality. We do get, on the periphery we do get. But they should see other people who are seriously involved with Sahaja Yoga, how they are behaving; what is their way of doing it and how their life is. What have they achieved? What powers have they achieved? And what kind of a life they lead? That is how you should judge the person to whom they have to do.

I am sorry that this Canberra is so full of Left Swadishthana and if you allow these things to continue, I don’t know what will happen to your government. It will all go to dogs if this stupid thing is allowed to work out, because all the bhoots will jump on all these civil servants and serious things can happen. I am quite surprised how it is allowed in Australia, where is the land of Shri Ganesha. As it is I am here now, I am sure something will happen and they will give up that. But as far as coming to Sahaja Yoga, I would say it’s a headache. You better give yourselves a bandhan before touching them anywhere near because they will give you lot of trouble. I have had lots of trouble with them. So much so, we had to leave one of our ashrams. You see, we had three persons in that ashram from TM and they used to scream so much, and this jumping about was so much that the neighbours told us that, ‘You better get out from here,’ and because of them we had to get out. All kinds of funny things they do.

First time I saw these TM people, were in a hall, and they took the first chairs, you see: first row they were sitting there. As soon as I started speaking, they all started jumping like jack-in-the-box. I said, ‘What’s the matter? It’s perfectly all right, what’s the matter? Who are these people?’ I had never seen such a thing before. I was quite surprised that, who are these people jumping like this one by one, you see. Then I asked them, they said, ‘We do TM and we are doing siddha course.’ I said, ‘Siddha course? Stupid people you are, that’s what you are.’ And out of these six or seven people who were jumping, we could only save about, I should say, two or three. So, those people who have gone to that, you shouldn’t worry so much about them. But, of course, if it has gone to the government, it is better to beat the government with shoes and give bandhan to the government so that they don’t get entangled with it. But is a serious thing, and I have to work it out Myself on those lines, because I was quite shocked that in Canberra, they have such bad vibrations. I came to Canberra much before with My husband and I told him that, ‘The vibrations here are very, very bad.’ So he said, ‘All the capital cities are like that.’ I said, ‘But it seems to be rather funny that both these centres are catching so badly.’ And I couldn’t walk that time also and today also the same thing happened to Me.

Now, we have many other people who are seeking God. They live in the villages. These people have not gone to the villages because they wanted only rich people, moneyed people. So, there are many people in the villages who haven’t yet received their Self-Realisation and they can receive their Self-Realisation without any difficulties. You can go there and talk to them and get them realised because they are not people for whom these rakshashas are waiting. We have to give them realisation. Once you give realisation to people in the villages, things will change. The atmosphere will change and you’ll find lots of people coming to Sahaja Yoga. So, I would say, I am very happy that in Sydney itself, you have so many centres and in other cities you have so many centres. But now we have to reach the villages and see them. They are innocent, simple people living in the villages in a very simple manner and it’s better to give them proper attention, because they are the ones who will get realisation.

Then the children, the children should be attended to. They can be very nicely brought to Sahaj and because there may be many of them who are already born realised. So, the children can be brought into Sahaja Yoga, but not without the permission of their parents, because the laws and regulations are such that we may land up in the prison [Shri Mataji laughs] without asking the permission of the father or mother. So, one has to be very careful. Then another are the adolescent boys and girls who are studying in the colleges and who are not yet exposed so much to all these bad things. They might be drug addicts little bit or may be other addiction they might be having, but they are not yet crushed by these horrible evil forces. So, you can just attend to them. You can also advertise that you can look after people who are addicted to all these drugs and all that. You can relieve them. If you are allowed to do that, you can advertise, get those people and if you give them realisation, they might be able to get over their addiction completely.

There is a doctor, Dr. Wells in London, who has now become a very big doctor in charge of a hospital of addiction. So, I said, ‘What do you do to them? How do you manage this addiction business?’ He said, ‘In their absence I beat them with shoes, that’s all and they are all getting rid of their addiction.’ So, you can attend to those boys who are now grown up boys and are taking to drugs and things like that. They are seekers: that’s why they are going to these things. I think this kind of an attitude, if you have, that you are not going to attend to people who are already with some gurus and with something and encounter them. But attend to people who, by their innocence have fallen into some problems or to the innocent people in the villages or children who are innocent; I am sure you can prosper much faster.

So, Sahaja Yoga is growing very much faster here and in a way, in a city it is growing. But we can grow them much faster, I think, the way there are people, so many people, are in the villages and in the countryside; in a very simple way they live. As for Myself, to come to Australia is such an excitement and such a joy because last year I could not come and this year, when they said it was the Sahasrara Puja to perform here and wait there, I was very happy.

Tomorrow we have to have that puja. I was also a person, in a way you can say, a seeker, because I was trying to find out a method, the way, by which I could really give en-masse realisation. I could give realisation to many people at the same time and for that, I was really working very, very hard, understanding lots of people, human beings, and out of them I found bureaucrats are the worse. As you have lots of bureaucrats in this Canberra; may be that they are not so good because, you see they have to compromise all the time. They have to say, ‘Yes sir, yes sir,’ and despite their resistance, despite their not liking, to say that they are, poor things, pushed into a job where they have to work it out because after all, job is important. When all these things become important, the person’s personality suffers a lot. And that’s what I found, that the bureaucrats who are seeking all the time power, go after a man who can give them some more power, in a sense, the power not of the Divine but over the people, that they can dominate more people and they can manage more people. And that’s why these people fall into these groups because in the beginning, they feel relaxed in a way and they dominate many people as there are bhoots sitting with them who give them ideas. But then they get tired of them and then they fall sick. So, many people commit suicide also. Suicide – I was told that suicide is maximum, suicide cases are maximum in Canberra. The reason is this only that, you don’t know what to do with yourself. You suffer from some sort of a miserable disease. You don’t know how to get out of it and then you commit suicide.

So, all these things are connected with the attack of the evil forces and these evil forces attack you in a very subtle manner. So, one should be careful as to mature. One has to mature in Sahaja Yoga so that nothing can affect them, nothing can trouble them, nothing can bother them. One has to mature. The maturity should be such as like Mine. If I catch it, I mean, I deliberately catch it and then I try to solve the problem. But if you cannot do that, then you should not catch also because you will suffer little bit by catching them.

Now, for tomorrow’s puja I hope you will all be ready and you will all enjoy tomorrow’s puja. I had a very nice puja in Pune which I had to perform on the thirteenth, because it is a date called Akshaya Tritiya, means undestructible third day of the moon. That’s actually nobody knew, but it is the puja of the Kundalini itself. And that day, everybody felt very, very clear. Very clear. Puja was hardly for about half an hour, the real puja of the Kundalini, but everybody felt extremely clear and beautiful. So, that sort of a puja we should do also tomorrow, if possible, so that we’ll have the feelings of the Sahasrara completely opened out. Because even if Sahasrara is opened, the rest of the chakras, if they are caught up, then you’ll have problems. It’s better to clear out all the chakras and then the Sahasrara. So, tomorrow we’ll do the puja in that fashion and I hope it will work out very well for all of you.

I hope... I have been rather late today for all of you and I am not taking too much of your time here with you. [laughter] Tomorrow I think it should be – you see, actually you’ll be surprised that this is the time I opened the Sahasrara in India. This is exactly the time, because just now it’s 6:30 there, 6:35, and about 6:30, I opened Sahasrara. So, you can imagine this is the time I opened the Sahasrara there and this is the time we are sitting on the other side of the world and celebrating that day, that great day of Sahasrara being opened out. It’s a very great day in the history of spirituality, very great day for the whole world. They will realise one day what it was. Such a great time that Sahasrara could be opened for masses. Not only that, but you are empowered to do that great work. May God bless you.

[aside to Yogi] All right, now what’s the program is?

Yogi: Should You rest a bit? We’ve got some Indian dancing.

Shri Mataji: All right. Now I am, you see, up because – now 6:30, I get up there, I mean I’m quite up at 6:30 in India, but you must be all sleepy.  All right, you can move the children a little. If you want, I can move Myself? I can sit on the other chair. They can dance here. [arrangements are made for children to dance. Shri Mataji asks for Her spectacles and Her purse]

[break in recording]

Shri Mataji: ... two wrestlers, you see, wrestling. They go on saying all the time to each other: ‘How do you do? How do you do?’ And it goes on for hours. And then the wrestling is for one minute. [laughs]Then we can have some music, a little bit, and then sleep on.

What time it started raining here?

Yogi: It probably started about one o’clock in the afternoon, which was when You were taking Your nap.

Shri Mataji: That’s a long time.

Yogi: It started raining here too.

[Indian dance performance]

Shri Mataji: You must also explain to them what you have been dancing, otherwise they won’t know. [child makes brief explanation about a puja dance] With this dancing, what you have to see is the, first of all the, do the whole dancing with bent legs – very difficult – and the co-relationship with the hands, and the face, and the feelings: all that is expressed. Now in this, the puja, where they showed how a garland is made and how they give a flowers, and all that, but the main thing is the rhythm. The rhythmic patterns are very fast, very fast thing, and say, if you have to do waltz, it would take such a long of time, and you’ll do the same and same patterns. But here, the patterns are not so much repeated, except for once or twice it is repeated.

And then, the thing is the expression is of complete involvement in the dance, in the ecstasy of the dance, so that the hands, the feet and the face and the neck – everything is completely integrated and harmoniously working out an expression. That’s the thing to be seen in this one. And My daughters also did Bharatanatyam for quite some time, then they grew very tall, you see, then they started feeling shy and they said, ‘We can’t.’ They did it on the stage which is after some time only, you are allowed to do on the stage. But traditionally, it’s a dance which is... which expresses every kind of thing. So there are, where they have the patterns of rhythmic movements – they call it as tilana, which is a very, very fast dancing. Then there’s a pattern in which they just show the feelings, and that also is very beautifully done. But you’ll be amazed, the feelings are also, have to be done on the same rhythmic pattern, and is all one by one they have to know: it’s not just you can just say that: ‘All right, now I’m doing the acting.’ It’s not like that. It’s all woven together. It’s quite a difficult dance. And I must congratulate these girls; except for their hair, they’re absolutely Indian. [laughter] And it would be really very charming for Indians to see this kind of dancing from these girls; they were really very involved and I wish they would go very far with their dancing. I don’t know if you have such a nice school, but we have in India some schools where they do teach, and when we start our school of arts and crafts, we are going to have Bharatanatyam as one of them, so they can join us.

May God bless you.

One more dance? What is it called? [child answers] Jathiswaram. Now Jathiswaram is the one where, on the notation, on the notes, notation, they dance. Jathiswaram – means on the notation. All right, let’s have it. Is the rhythmic pattern again. [the dance is performed]

Haven’t you enjoyed it more because you have understood it? Just the notes played on this particular tune, or a melody of notes, there’s a variety of expressions – variety of dancing, you can call it – because, what happens that, in the first pattern, they build it up like that. Second pattern – it’s a permutations and combinations of many patterns, but the tune is the same, the same tune. There’s nothing, I should say, emotional about it, just the pattern woven around a particular note system.

Is there one more? [child answers that only one of them is doing the next dance] But which one is this? Sapta. Sapta means [sounds like/cell] and from that you will see that now, how she builds it up.  [the dance is performed]

Very well done, this beautiful dancing, and to express all these things is not easy. Dancing, and expressing your feelings , describing Shri Krishna and His ways, in such a short thing, that – I couldn’t hear the music otherwise I would have told you each and every detail as to what their singing – but she was doing all that was sung, in such a fast way.

[music program continues]

[Talk Two]

So tomorrow, you are going to have the puja, Sahasrara Day Puja. We’ll start about eleven o’clock, as we say, and I hope we’ll be all very much in a receptive mood and do this great job, because I think tomorrow is very significant, very, very significant, to have this puja here. And a big responsibility on Australians to understand that. Not easy to understand Sahaja Yoga: very difficult. To understand means even worse [laughter] because you know I am Mahamaya. Recently a photograph has come where My eight hands are showing – I am just holding some flowers and there are eight hands. If somebody says, ‘Mother, what is this?’ I don’t know. [laughter]

Now, there’s another nice photograph that has come – a person who was a Shiva bhakta and he had put My photograph with other photographs and when he took the photograph, a complete linga, [symbol of Shiva] you see, of that shape, like an eye’s, was there on My feet. I mean, in the photograph, the photograph’s photograph he took. So that’s what it is; all are suggestions to you, because I think I cannot say about Myself. So the suggestions are coming to you by so many means, by so many methods. So many miracles are taking place for you to see, like when we were building this house, it was... there was no water available, so the neighbour offered his well and said, ‘You can take water from this but it will only work out for one or two sucking – I mean, the water that is sucked out, only once or twice you can do it.’ I said, ‘All right, doesn’t matter.’ So they washed My feet and put the water into that well. And the whole house we built with that water: the whole house.

Then another miracle took place with water was that, a gentleman made a bore – he didn’t understand anything about water. I told that, there wouldn’t be any water in this place: three hundred and fifty feet he went down. You know there’s a drought in Maharashtra and there was no water, not a single drop. Then they again washed My feet and put the water. Now the water has arrived at thirty feet deep. Like that, many, many miracles have taken place all the... throughout, and you can’t explain: you can’t say. It’s like that, if you can understand God then it’s not God anymore.

Actually, it took Me sometime to say something about Myself; it’s very hard. Also, I am worried that your ego should not stand up immediately when I say something about Myself –may –that: ‘Why this lady? Why not me?’ [embarrassed laughter] Yes, there were questions like that. So, I told the gentleman, ‘All right, I’m very happy. Yes, I’ll retire, I’ll be very happy. You come and sit in My chair and deliver the goods.’

So, tomorrow I’m going to tell you something which you have to take with a very receptive mind. Ah, something very special. But you have to have a very receptive mind: if you are very conditioned or your ego is there, it may be difficult. But truth has to be told sometime, and if truth is not accepted, it will express itself, but it will destroy many things. So, best thing is to accept the truth as it is. Accept it: put it in your heart, is a fact. You all have known so many miracles yourself. I mean, I’m not telling you something new. But still, I had better prepare you for that.

So tonight, before sleeping, you must pray that you should be able to accept the great truth that I am going to tell tomorrow. May God bless you. And it’s the Australians who are going to receive it first; they have a special temperament I think, of innocence and I am sure it will then go round the whole world. So may God bless you.
