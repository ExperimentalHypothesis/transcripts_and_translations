Conversation with doctors about epilepsy, New Delhi (India), 4 November 1986.

[A Hindi transcript with English portions]

Shri Mataji: That is supraconscious. He will be in trouble.

Sahaja Yogi: The one on the Left

Shri Mataji: Yes, he will face physical problems.

Sahaja Yogi: He will trouble others.

Shri Mataji: He will scold others. He will be sick and trouble the heck out of other people as well! [She used a strong Hindi idiom] Such is the right-sided.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, please, tell about epilepsy.

Shri Mataji: Epilepsy is left-sided. Epilepsy can happen also by chance but there has to be vulnerability. A vulnerability, supposing a child is born and the mother dies at that time. He’s born or lived under bad circumstances. If your psyche is weak, you become vulnerable for any entity to enter. Then he can’t bear it.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s a possession.

Shri Mataji: It keeps [fits] coming and going. It’s not a permanent one, a permanent one is a lunatic. [Sahaja Yogi: Plain and simple]. The person cannot tolerate it and falls unconscious. Why? Because of virus. What is virus? Viruses are also some dead vegetable which have gone into our Collective Subconscious. So, that attacks.

Sahaja Yogi: So, Mother, they all hide in the Left Swadishthan?

Shri Mataji: No, they hide beyond, much beyond. Firstly, you have your present-subconscious, what has happened in your recent past. Then, you have your past-subconscious. Then you have your past-past-subconscious, meaning, your past lives. Post that, we have the collective-subconscious. And in some cases, for example, how one gentleman had bone cancer. That would happen in case there is an injury. He said there is no injury as such. Later, it was known that at the time of the accident, fearful thoughts came. Fear takes one on the Left. While in the Left, a bhoot entered him and kept sitting. At that time, some incident happened that stirred him emotionally.

Sahaja Yogi: So, epilepsy indicates presence of ‘bhoot’?

Shri Mataji: Epilepsy is a bhootish [sickness], epilepsy is curable.

Sahaja Yogi: That means Mother, is comes in circulation from the Left to the Right and gives the signs of the movements of the body through the Right?

Shri Mataji: Not exactly. All the physical trouble [pain etc.] comes through the Left side. [Man interrupts: But the actual physical] It effects as a physical fit but it is a spontaneous result. By physical, it means when you do things deliberately in your consciousness.

Sahaja Yogi: Means, as to explain, somatic activity of the Hypothalamus as well, we used to call it an autonomic activity but now we are coming on- [Shri Mataji: Yes, separation UNCLEAR] that is somatic activity. On epilepsy, Shri Mataji is giving him a PHD, what all we have to do in it?

Shri Mataji: Firstly, you have to give him [patient] a basis, meaning what is the nature in epilepsy.

Identify who is vulnerable to it. Left side has an important role to play. Because of left-sided activity: bad motherhood, alcoholic parents, anything full of sorrow and gloom or someone who is in the habit of pitying himself, faced black magic, went to false gurus, poems of crying or sorrowful books, those who read/listen to ghazals – basically, the tendency to find pleasure in pain. For example, you have a sensible married life and still you run towards someone else’s wife [Man laughs]. Hence, this diversion that occurs, meaning, when you move away from reality to unreal things, it affects you more. Now more reasons for epilepsy are, supposing some entities sit in your subconscious related to exorcists, you watch any films like that, it all affects you. Any existing fears also trigger epilepsy. Fear and unhappiness. If you start crying out of fear or you saw a dead body or you went to a cremation ground or went to the church because there are so many dead people buried inside the churches such situations triggers epilepsy. Not in India but in foreign countries, the dead are buried within the church premises – especially, children catch easily. Hence, one must avoid a dead body.

See the beauty of our scriptures; whenever you carry a dead body, you keep singing songs as the bhoots run away from music. Arrange for eating so everyone feels relieved. When one starts staying unhappy, he becomes susceptible to epilepsy.

Anorexia is also from this [bhoot]. Any psychological shock, for example, things related to your parents, makes such persons vulnerable for attack by bhoots. Some bhoots are fond of fasting, some are fond of eating and drinking and some are fond of Hatha Yoga. Now, you see Mr. Rao, this frail man from the military, it took Me years to cure him, years!

He went to fight in Pakistan. While returning, he passed through a cremation ground in Punjab. There he was possessed by a Hatha Yogi’s spirit and he started doing asanas day and night! Who had never performed any asana ever, practicing it day and night! When he came in front of Me, he was uncontrollable! Looked like the intestines were brought out! Looked like he was about to die! The stomach was completely sucked in. He asked Me to cure him, so did his wife. The man who did this to him [Mr. Rao] must have been an extremist. It was beyond his control. Now he is all right since around three years.

Sahaja Yogi: Did he find the cure Candling?

Shri Mataji: What candles, he must have burnt camphor by the kilos! For such cases, camphor is good as it cures easily.

Sahaja Yogi: Really? With camphor?

Shri Mataji: Yes. Now these bhoots act differently on different chakras. If they come at Mooladhara, you will have those kinds of problems. How in foreign countries, perversion due to sex has come. In India, there was a girl who got this problem. When I called her, she came with her husband. On Mooladhara, one behaves like mad. Especially, it attacks the innocence in children.

Sahaja Yogi: What it the best way to clean the Mooladhara/such catches?

Shri Mataji: One should recite the Ganesha Stuti, to clear the Mooladhara Chakra. Now you cannot call it epilepsy, as if it comes and goes.

The main characteristic of epilepsy is that here the individual resists the possession. He doesn’t accept it. If you accept the bhoot, then it acts through you. It uses your ego. If you do not accept and you just resist, then it acts on your body. So, epilepsy comes through the Agnya.

Agnya is caught up by two ways: when one doesn’t forgive and keeps thinking about that same thing and secondly, when one has adulterous and roving eyes. This is also playing with bhoots. Christ declared: "You shall not have adulterous eyes".

Sahaja Yogi: Roving eyes.

Shri Mataji: Roving eyes. They come through the right side – ego. That is the ego part. Such persons can also have mesmeric eyes. If he looks at someone, he can mesmerize him. All this is at the second stage. And if he doesn’t wish to be mesmeric, if he is a person who is not with roving eyes but who has condemned himself fully that he has done something wrong and he cannot forgive another person, when such a person gets a badha, he gets epilepsy. Mostly in epilepsy, there is another agency [urgency]. For example, if somebody is condemned day/night, for exmaple the wife [by in-laws or husband or by boss] there is constant fear during day and night.

Sahaja Yogi: Fear is the main thing in this. Insecurity [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Substantial amount of fear or a periodic fear. A moment arrives when he is thrown into collective subconscious, he catches somebody and you get it. But he, himself, will not act. But a right-sided person will act.

Sahaja Yogi: Will he have maniac tendencies?

Shri Mataji: Who? The right-sided man? No, not maniac. Actually, he will mesmerize the ladies. Whichever women he would look at, would get mesmerized by him. Rajneesh [Osho] used to do so.

Sahaja Yogi: So, basically, it is a Front Agnya problem. But mainly, Back Agnya?

Shri Mataji: From front Agnya to [UNCLEAR] and from Left Agnya, is epilepsy.

Sahaja Yogi: Then, Mother, the clearance for epilepsy, the treatment, is clearance of the Back Agnya primarily?

Shri Mataji: Meaning, if there is suppression, if someone suppresses you, if someone gives you one [slap], give him three! [The Sahaja Yogi laughs in acknowledgement]. You see, tolerating means you absorb it within you. So, don’t take it inside, it will neutralize. For example, one gentleman was very honest. He used to say, “I am very honest”. So, I asked him, how is he happy – being honest or dishonest? Because if you are honest and still sad, better be dishonest. [Laughs!] Other side is, that you take it as a joke. And needn’t be affected by it, by remaining a witness.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, what are the parameters in epilepsy?

Shri Mataji: Whoever has epilepsy, must have a word with him first.

Sahaja Yogi: His history..

Shri Mataji: History, stress and fear. How children are made fearful, “the devil will catch you”, are asked if you are raised by the Mother etc. Now, in England, children are made to sleep in a separate room, no maid to look after him, just like that! He will keep crying in the night while parents sleep separately. I asked them, "Why you don’t make your children sleep with your?" They said, "We sleep naked", hence, pets [being in their room] are ok. So, I told them, "Better you now give birth to pets! [Dogs and cats!]". England is so cold, how do they sleep without clothes! Such dead people, they require sensations for everything! All their ideas are perverted! All the things that you would do spontaneously, in a localized way, with your brain, so what harm will happen?

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, treatment for epilepsy. Clearance of the Back Agnya, primarily?

Shri Mataji: Mainly, Mooladhara and Back Agnya. And Back Agnya in which all combinations, one has to check. Supposing, if problem is from Mother’s side, especially if the Mother is constantly fuelling the child’s mind against his father or siblings, such a child will keep crying [be morose]. It will fall on his Heart. If the father was an alcoholic/pervert/violent, Right Heart will be affected. Identify the source to decode the combination. Firstly, establish the source and the combinations. Then identify on the chakras and the job is done.

Sahaja Yogi: History is important.

Shri Mataji: History and connection.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, we were thinking, in epilepsy, there are three kinds of parameters. First, EEG [Electroencephalogram]

Shri Mataji: The Theta waves that come.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, we shall observe them.

Shri Mataji: Also, in epilepsy, it so happens that when the patient begins to recover, the attacks’ frequency or normal period [in between attacks] increases. For example, if a person gets an attack every 8th day, especially, there is also a relationship with phases of of Moon, being the Left side. When there is Amavasya, one definitely gets an attack. So, one gets it every month or on Poornima or Ekadashi. Then, the frequency changes. The attack will come after a gap of 2 months, 4 months and later 1 year and that’s how a person gets cured. Since I have the power to see, I can see the bhoot as a red insect sort of thing in the brain.

Sahaja Yogi: Does it [badha/disorder] show in the CAT scan in that case? CAT scan, is a special type of XRAY. It shows in the brain, where any glass is [foreign bodies] present.

Shri Mataji: If the scan captures the minutest things, it can show. You can study it. In my times, we didn’t have these things [technologies]. It is a good move.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it captures the Brain from different angles, in entirety! Captures every milimeter! So, one should get one EEG and a CAT Scan. And then get neurotransmitters estimated because being Left side, ..... [UNCLEAR] can metabolise [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: They [UNCLEAR] would be less. Secretions would be less.

Sahaja Yogi: Estimations would be on cerebrospinal fluid

Shri Mataji: In activity, if it becomes maximum

Sahaja Yogi: With pressure of the...chemical changes.. [UNCLEAR] Means when he starts doing SY, a difference will be seen.

Shri Mataji: A difference will be seen, balance will be seen.

Sahaja Yogi: A change will be seen in the transmitters.

Shri Mataji: And what is noteworthy is that acetecolyne [UNCLEAR] and colene [UNCLEAR] has different actions on different chakras. Despite being the same chemical, it is augment on one chakra and toxin [UNCLEAR] on another and ......you people couldn’t do.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it is difficult].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] In that separation/secretions, the deities are sitting there. They act according to [UNCLEAR]. For example, the light that illuminates your house can burn it down too.

Sahaja Yogi: Same thing can be utilized by the presiding Deity.

Shri Mataji: You have to understand the Deities. Now, who’s on the Left side? Left side has Maha Bhairava and MahaGanesha. Now where do the powers of Maha Bhairava come from? From the Centre Heart, as they are called, antibodies. Antibodies are indeed the power of Maha Bhairava. If the antibodies reduce in your body, you get susceptible to diseases.

Sahaja Yogi: The role of immunoglobulins in it? Do they effect in rheumatoid arthritis [RA] as well? In swelling etc?

Another Sahaja Yogi: Mother, do you remember the case you saw in Coimbatore? It was a typical case of RA. That lady was a difficult case of rheumatoid arthritis, that lady who is working in the post department.

Shri Mataji: Arthritis is of many kinds. One being, where the root is caught [hand gestures] which is owing to left-side. Actually, such a person is a nice person, a good person but the vibrations freeze in such a person.

 Sahaja Yogi: So, it is the collection again of the breakdown products in the areas that bring about the physical changes of the joints.

Shri Mataji: Such a person is a good person, if he has these things, what he has to do, is to go to the sea where the vibrations can be sucked in. And he should give vibrations to others.

Sahaja Yogi: Can a tantric give that to anybody?

Shri Mataji: Tantric, they can’t. But there is another kind of arthritis where the entire body becomes stiff! You can’t walk.

Sahaja Yogi: Ankylosing spondylitis.

Shri Mataji: It’s a possession by bhoot. It can be corrected in one minute by Sahaja Yoga! Sea bath is very good. The entire body feels a kind of pull! It restricts the mobility.

Sahaja Yogi: How do you set it right?

Shri Mataji: Get the bhoot going!

Sahaja Yogi: For the rest of RA, is sea bath good?

Shri Mataji: Sea bath is good. Go there and let your vibrations out or on the sand. Salted water, anything can help them.

Sahaja Yogi: Would intake of salt also help such people?

Shri Mataji: Not intake. Those people who are helped by outside is a sectionary thing. For example, if you have a problem at the Vishuddhi chakra, now, there’s one way of, let’s say, it is Me, if I leave 'ghee', naturally, I shall get dryness in the body. But if I apply it in my nose or on my hands, I can solve the problem. But if I take 'ghee', it will have another effect. But if apply from outside, it will just not have the same effect. Consumption will not take place. It should not be consumed; 'ghee' should not be consumed.

Sahaja Yogi: It will fall under breakdown then.

Shri Mataji: But actually, whatever is being converted into fats is not being available to other parts, hence, dryness appears. If the entire fat accumulates in the stomach, other organs will feel the dryness. Now, if you take 'ghee', it won’t help! Peritoneum gets dried.

Sahaja Yogi: Application on the stomach itself is more helpful.

Shri Mataji: Much more helpful. Not on the stomach but wherever it is required. If the peritoneum dries up, don’t just apply on the stomach but rotate on the stomach so it goes into circulation. Because the fat is not into circulation, that’s why you are having this problem. Now you cannot get into circulation by taking more [UNCLEAR] only, you’ll add fat to fat. But by application, you put and end to that problem. For example, ears, if they get dried, tinnititus – you can put oil in the ears or in the nose. Apply "Relaxyl ointment" on the sides, it relaxes you.

Sahaja Yogi: This particular area helps with the Swadishthan also.

Shri Mataji: Yes, very well. What happens is that the entire dryness one can feel. So, one must put oil. People don’t use oil on their heads which leads to dryness in other part, leading to hair fall, greying of the hair. Now there is no fashion to put oil. Earlier times, people would grease their hair with oil!

Sahaja Yogi: Even diseases like psoriasis?

Shri Mataji: Of course! Psoriasis is very simple to cure! Now, let’s look at it – if you have taken ice inside the stomach, you will feel hot because when it will melt, you know it generates heat. So, don’t take it inside. Better, you apply it from the outside. Ice with vibrated salt on the liver [right-side]. Your asthma will also get cured. It happens due to the dryness of peritoneum.

Sahaja Yogi: What about this intake of 'geru' and honey?

Shri Mataji: 'Geru' is also for Left side, meaning calcium deficiency. Like I said, allergies can take place. You can consume calcium externally as well as internally. There may not be a calcium deficiency but supposing you have white spots, [vitiligo]: apply vibrated 'geru' over it. Don’t take it inside. It is consumed inside when there is arthritis.

Sahaja Yogi: Even is psoraisis?

Shri Mataji: Psoriasis is caused due to over activity of the liver. For this, the best is ice and vibrated salt. No intake of it though. Calcium is heat-giving. What arises due to cold, from the left, use calcium for it. As you know, if you take calcium, vitamin D weakens it. It indicates there is a deficiency of the sun [element] in you and if there it is more, take calcium to compensate.

Sahaja Yogi: Actually, psoriasis is also connected with the right side, Right Swadishthan activity?

Shri Mataji: Skin cancer is because of excessive sun rays. How these people go sit in the sun, going half mad just by that! In my childhood, we were prohibited from going there [to the beach], it was like a punishment because this brain of ours, it is made up of fat, it also melts with excessive sun, which is why these people become mad.

Sahaja Yogi: Please shed some light on bronchial asthma. Is it also due to a calcium deficiency?

Shri Mataji: No, not like this...there are two kinds. One is, allergic, the other is physical. Allergic – due to dryness of the peritoneum, right-sided. Like, Mr. Patankar, his is not allergic, it is more due to right-sidedness. I asked him earlier to try clearing with light first. When light didn’t help, I figured his right side is completely caught up. I told him to try with ice, keep the ice pack. So, he asked Me, “For how long will I have to wander like this [with the ice pack]?” [Laughs] I told him, after a few days, he wouldn’t require it. Now he is all right and roaming around without the ice!

Sahaja Yogi: So, it gets cured by ice?

Shri Mataji: Yes. Ice is the first option. You can also apply 'ghee' but ice works the best as it cools down. What you can do is, apply 'ghee' on your feet. Now rub it with a copper bowl, the black soot comes out, it sucks all the heat. Haven’t you seen? It is like magic! If you use it on my Feet, you can get a kajal [kohl] to be applied in your eyes. The bowl must be of Bronze [Kaansya – Copper]. You can use silver as well. But normally, copper works better on people.

Sahaja Yogi: This is to take out heat from the system?

Shri Mataji: Heat gets emitted from both Left and Right side. Coolness is a sign of ...[UNCLEAR]. Heat comes from both Left and Right side because of friction. On one hand, there is fusion and on the other, there is, explosion. Both emit heat.

[Sahaja Yogi: UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: One more thing, in epilepsy, one never gets fever. Be it any left sided problem/catch, one never gets fever. Even in cancer, one never gets fever. Mad people can never get heart attacks. As Rustom also told Me, that in his clinic/hospital, they had a [some sort of a] machine that got rusted because of no use! So, I told him, "What is it [machine] even doing in an asylum? Keep it elsewhere!"" [LAUGHS!]

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, can fever cause epilepsy in children?

Shri Mataji: Fever will not come. Fever can happen as a result.

Sahaja Yogi: Can epilepsy happen because of fever?

Shri Mataji: Very high temperature can occur. That is more of a cause, because of epilepsy.

Sahaja Yogi: Where it is basically, the viral infection, an in epileptic fit in high fever?

Shri Mataji: In epilepsy? It is a possession. In viral infection if you get possession, fever can come. Viral infection can be very dangerous also! Reason being, firstly, the virus can come from the vegetables but, just like, what you call, tobacco, it is also extremely devilish!

Sahaja Yogi: What about bacterial infections?

Shri Mataji: It is more or less, the same thing. You can say, some plant cells that come as virus and bacteria is unicellular cells which have gone out of the circulation. Because they were aggressive, like aggressive animals so they were thrown out of circulation. Many people become animalistic. Many unicellular cells, something like paramecium [UNCLEAR] also became aggressive, they have also gone out of circulation.

Sahaja Yogi: So, all the viral and bacterial infections are left-sided?

Shri Mataji: Of course! Viral, bacterial and possession are all from the left. But yeah, other infections such as, mosquito bite, tumour fever [UNCLEAR] – comes from the right side. Meaning, viruses etc, you can’t find out their origin but this [tumour fever] is visible, the viscera [UNCLEAR] is visible. This is indeed in the present. Those that were in the past, when they attack, you wouldn’t know their origin.

Amoebic dysentry, it is indeed right-sided, means coming from the Right side. Indicates what you can see with your eyes, whatever you can’t see, must be from the past.

Sahaja Yogi: Quite right. What is the cure for amoebic dysentery? It is a very common ailment.

Shri Mataji: Use Lord Dattatreya’s Name [mantra] for amoebic dysentery, it strengthens the stomach. Basically, you have to strengthen the stomach. With a [strong] guru tatwa, amoeba becomes all right. [A Sahaja Yogi asks for a specific person’s problem]. Get sugar vibrated for him. Avoid sugarcane juice with ginger and dairy products at all costs. Take 'Liv-52', the weather is very pleasant these days so take kokum water with sugar, cardamom, gulkand [a concoction primarily made out of rose petals], candy sugar. Khaand [unrefined cane sugar] takes things to Right side, avoid it.

Sahaja Yogi: And diet as such, should be vegetarian?

Shri Mataji: For him, of course, should be vegetarian but without any fat whatsoever.

Sahaja Yogi: [discussing a specific case]: I feel very anxious, nervous, emotional.

Shri Mataji: Yours is aggravated. Come, sit for a few minutes. [Stresses on strengthening Guru tatva to another person].

Sahaja Yogi: I lost my father early in life. I used to go to my maternal uncle’s place. I was brought up there.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] Keep your hand on your stomach and say, “Mother, I am my own Guru. Say it”. [Instructs another person] Get a matka for him. The problem is of both Left and Right sides.

Sahaja Yogi: Should we continue for a few months, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Do a series of 7 matkas. Actually, it is because of such people that my hand doesn’t work. Evil people! Such villainy in this country! And the doctors don’t believe, who to tell! On one side are these non-believers and on the other, the wicked ones hell bent on destroying [the seekers]. I came in such conditions, dear doctor, where everyone is caught. So much advancement of you people.

The Sahaja Yogi interrupts: Everyone is getting all right because of You, for such things have no cure. Doctors can never treat these disorders.

Shri Mataji: Yes, at the most, the doctors will remove your nose or your ears. Removal is not ‘cure’, it is nonsense!

Sahaja Yogi: Which is why in medical science, there is little scope to understand Sahaja Yoga or its treatments. [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Any why to keep them in hospitals, one shouldn’t! Patients spend so much money, think about it. A gentleman came and spent 3 lacs on his treatment. His wife started crying, stating she doesn’t have that much money.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, there is a gentleman waiting downstairs. He has some problems, he is a very left-sided man.

Shri Mataji [laughing]: If he is left-sided, you people make him right-sided! [To another person] This is very important, Mooladhara plays a vital role in curing the diseases. [UNCLEAR] Cancers, what do you call that where disability happens?

Sahaja Yogi: Muscular atrophy. [UNCLEAR – Personal conversation about going to Jaipur, talks about Sahaja Yogis taking miracle photographs of Her, more people wishing to meet Her downstairs, discussion about a Sahaja Yogi’s personal property, speaks about public programs in Marathi]

[Some people have come insisting on seeing Shri Mataji again and again.]

Shri Mataji [to them]: It looks like you people will never be all right! Either I have to give up or you give up, one of it. Because those people who always prefer to be gloomy and morose, the God himself tells them to remain in a pall of gloom! Such people actually indulge in gloom, find ‘pleasure in pain’. [Tells another person] When I have cured you, why are you falling still? [going back to the illness]. I have told you a hundred times to leave your fears aside and you expressed your concern at its [illness] relapse, so what am I to do?? If you fear its relapse, it will definitely happen! All that you will desire, will shape up! I told you to be happy, stay within the protocols, I did cure you, right? Then why have you fallen ill again?? Is it still catching? Your entire face changes! Now quit your gloom, sing along, laugh! Bhoots don’t come to people who are happy! Those who keep crying, wallow in self-pity, they get attacked by the bhoots! [Talks about people who follow the Rama-krishna mission, being hard nuts or severely affected!]

[48:28 A Sahaja Yogi shares his personal problems in Marathi.  48:60]

Another Sahaja Yogi has brought blouses and saris on behalf of all the people present! [Shri Mataji laughs].

[49:50 Marathi conversation]

[A couple due to be married, seeks Shri Mataji’s blessings. Locals are presenting Shri Mataji with a local fruit, ‘chakotra’ [melon].]

Shri Mataji: [Advises another Sahaja Yogi to use vibrated 'geru' to cleanse the skin]. While sitting in front of Me, the whiteness is turning reddish, it has begun to cure.  [More talk in somebody getting married, Shri Mataji remarks about how difficult it is to open a Sahaja Yoga center in Kanpur, how it is such a rotten place. Another Sahaja Yogini talks about problems in Dehradun center. Shri Mataji tells her, "Tie a rakhi to Arun Goyal, stay forever happy!" Shri Mataji tells her that she has a Vishuddhi problem so she should keep a supari [betelnut] in her mouth. “If you keep it, there will be no more fights! Ok?”

Another Sahaj Yogini talks about someone in her family suffering from blood cancer. Shri Mataji tells her to stay carefree, follow a regulated lifestyle [timely meals etc], stop fasting, no haste in any work, stay happy! Following a regulated lifestyle can cure blodd cancer.]

[END OF RECORDING. Not possible to know from which talk comes the following information]

HEART LETHARGIC: whenever there is lethargic heart, there is no sufficient blood for circulation.

ANGINA [cordis]: can be due to Left Vishuddhi that is whenever there is wrong mantra recitation. In this case it is due to blockage as heart can’t pump properly.

CEREBRO VASCULAR ACCIDENT [C.V.A.]: it is due to paralysis of blood supply. Gayatri Mantra is right sided mantra. If a fat person recites Gayatri mantra his cholesterol level will increase. It is to be used only for left sided badha.

No mantra should be used without Realisation. All persons who recite Gayatri Mantra become hot tempered. All those who recite “OM NAMAH SHIVAYA” get heart problems. Those who recite Vishnu’s Mantra their Kundalini doesn’t get up.

One should not go to extreme in mantras, even 5-10 minutes of meditation is sufficient. One should use brakes or accelerator whenever required.

Shri Mataji mentioned that She doesn’t take carbohydrates. She only takes Nitrogen [i.e. protein].

Due to aggressive behaviour they are removed from circulation. Unicellular organism paramecium is aggressive. So, these are removed from circulation and become bacteria.

TUBERCULOSES: Malaria comes from right side bacteria, are visible, and viruses are invisible.

FOR LIVER: Gulukund, candy sugar, elaichi, vegetables without fat for right sided liver.

PARKINSON’S DISEASE, MUSCLE DISEASE AND MYAESTENIA GRAVIS: are because of Mooladhara problems.

FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: use vibrated 'geru' with olive oil to rub on affected joints.

XXX

Left sympathetic nervous system represents our emotional side. Right sympathetic nervous system represents our physical side. When both come into play [i.e. psyche as well as somatic] then psychosomatic problems result.

In the overactivity of the right side, liver is the commonest to be disturbed. This is because of too much thinking. Swadishthan Centre has to manufacture grey cells for the brain when brain is overactive – futuristic and indulges in wasteful thinking – then these cells are used too much.

Liver disorders are also of two types:

– inactive or cold liver [in a left-sided emotional person] this leads to allergies.

– overactive or hot liver disorders, in a right-sided person.

Liver has an important function to remove poisons from the body. It removes the heat from the body system into the water in blood.

H O = 2. H + O H becomes H-O-H after absorbing

2 O H = heat from liver.

In alcoholic liver: O H, no penetration is possible.

H

[SHOULD BE? – In alcoholic liver: HOH, so no penetration is possible]

[GENERAL FORMULA IS: 2H+ + 2OH- = 2 H2O]

So, the heat in the system remains. But with vibrations, it is possible to correct it

Left side is Hydrogen [Moon], Right side is Oxygen, Amino-Acids [Nitrogen] forms the parasympathetic and Carbon is below [i.e. Mooladhara].

Alcohol causes sluggish liver. In overactivity of liver, CO2 is formed and Oxygen is sucked. So, the function of liver is disturbed. In lethargic liver, poisons are not removed from body, allergies are because of psychic element. Excessive thinking will lead to overwork for liver and consequently pancreas will be affected leading to diabetes. Diabetes is not because of excessive sugar intake. In Indian villages people take tea with so much sugar that the spoon can stand inside the cup. Diabetes is always because of excessive thinking in a sedentary person.

Allergies are also because of calcium deficiency in the childhood. Left Nabhi also governs spleen which can also be lethargic or overactive. Overactivity of spleen because of hectic life leads to blood cancer.

Spleen supplies [produces] blood cells. Newspaper reading also disturbs the function of spleen because of majority of negative news. So, no newspapers should be read in morning. If at all you want to read, read it in the bathroom. Hectic life leads to disturbed rhythm of spleen.

In ancient times wife [Gruha lakshmii] used to fan the husband while he was having the food. This used to act as a soft rhythm for speed of eating.

Where there is lethargy of Left Nabhi there is problem of allergies. Because spleen is the speedometer of body, in lethargic Left Nabhi, fat is accumulated in body [as metabolic speed is slowed]. Those who don’t think can’t lose weight as She [Gruha lakshmii] does not think.

Shri Mataji said that in Her case water content is kept and salt has to be left.

High Blood Cholesterol is due to lethargic heart. Fat is formed through the Left Nabhi. If there is a lethargic Left Nabhi and an overactive liver, then the fat starts circulation through the blood.

Shri Mataji said in Her case there is no cholesterol in blood as it doesn’t come to circulate.

KIDNEY: Overactivity causes high blood pressure because of excessive pumping. Lethargic kidneys cause low blood pressure [when moon side is active].

At this point, Shri Mataji remarked that it is easier to go from synthesis to analysis. The opposite is difficult.

Shri Mataji said that in a right-sided person, blood pressure on the right side is more than on the left side; it is the opposite in left-sided person.

Shri Adi Shakti is Shri Mahasaraswati, Shri Mahalakshmi, Shri Mahakali

Son–daughter–son.

Shri Brahmadeva + Shri Saraswati,

Shri Lakshmi + Shri Vishnu,

Shri Shankar + Shri Parwati

Shri Saraswati is the sister of Shri Shankar.

Shri Lakshmi is the sister of Shri Brahmadeva.

Shri Parvati is the sister of Shri Vishnu.

For example, if a person is using too much of the power of the Right Swadishthan [ whith thinking] Shri Saraswati has to take energy from Shri Shankar [who is in the heart]. So, a heart attack can occur to such a person [Shri Saraswati goes to her parental house and gets energy from Shri Shankar]. That is why, in such a person, the attention is distracted from the Spirit.

Shri Brahmadeva is active whenever there is action.

Shri Parvati is the desire: whenever you desire, then She has to take help from Shri Vishnu [Lakshmi], that is why, wherever there is black magic, there is poverty as Shri Lakshmi goes out.
