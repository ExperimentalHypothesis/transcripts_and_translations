Public Program Day 1, Vienna (Austria), 8 July 1986.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

You've already heard about the system that exists within us. This knowledge is the knowledge of the roots. The knowledge that we have about the outward world is the knowledge of the tree. So to understand this knowledge, first of all we have to use it like a hypothesis. And like an open minded scientist we should try to see if it is true or not. We know that we have evolved from the amoeba stage to this stage, but we have not reached our absolute state. If we were at absolute state there would have been no wars, no quarrels, no fighting. Our consciousness would have been a Collective Consciousness.

Today we see the whole world full of confusion and turmoil. And it is so very shocking to look at the future what are we taking our progeny into. If we understand the dangerous precipices on which we are standing today, we'll think about it: What are we going to give in this generation to our progeny?

We talk of peace, but there is no peace in the hearts of people. So one has to realize that there must be some methods, some more doing needed to achieve that state of peace. All the outward movement you have done on scientific things, on emotional style or anything that you have worked out so far has led us to nowhere. The person who is evolved knows how to relate to other persons. Not superficially, artificially, but innately. So there is something lacking in these modern times that we cannot relate to each other. Nations are arguing among themselves, they reach no point which will do justice to our progeny. So all thinking people have to accept one situation that a kind of a transformation is needed in the human beings. And we should go out of our country, out of our knowledge to find out is there any solution suggested.

The problem today is that because of religious problems young people don't want to hear any name of prophets, incarnations or any saints. They say, "Forget it." But whatever they have said is the truth. In the essence of it all of them have said the truth. But we are not at their awareness, at the level of their understanding, that's why we have committed mistakes. Let us see what Christ has to say. He has said, "You are to be born again." So there are people who certify themselves 'born again' and go about as if they are great yogis. When we baptize somebody that's all artificial. To be honest, when you take some water and put it on somebody's head and say that, "You are baptized," [it's?] not true. But what is the baptism? Let us face it honestly. Is there somewhere else people have talked about baptism? In every religion they have talked about it. Say, in India it is called as Self-realization, as a second birth. Like a little egg a human being comes on this earth and then he becomes a free bird. But nobody has tried to put attention of the followers to that, that you have to actualize the experience of Self-realization. You have to get it on your central nervous system. In your evolutionary process as you have become a human being, you have to become a super human being in your consciousness itself. But nobody has tried to see even that this is what is the prophets, the saints, the incarnations have said. In Koran they have described the Resurrection, the time of Resurrection. Pages after pages they have described more about this period when people will get transformed and they'll be resurrected. They call it Kiyama. Mohammed Sahib has said that, "At the time of Resurrection your hands will speak." How many Muslims have tried to find out about when their hands are going to speak? Same about Hindus. Moreover it is so disappointing that in a country like India where so much has been said about the Self-realization nobody is trying to pay attention to it. They all believe that western people are ideal, very happy people, and we should try to become western. You are developed countries, so all developing countries are trying to become like you. Thus the main thing that has to be done for us today of Self-realization has no priority. Neither in our individual life nor otherwise.

I'm happy that he has already described to you about the centers that are within us. But these centers, though exist within us, cannot be found out by doctors. Because they are centers of energies. For that you have to become a higher soul to feel them on your fingertips. Then you become the medicine, you become the doctor and you become the diagnosis. To look at Sahaja Yoga seems like instant coffee, somebody said. It is, what to do. In modern times everything has taken a speed and also your evolution has to take the speed. Is very simple to understand.

For example this instrument [the microphone] was formerly made by many people, many scientists, would not work out properly, but today it is perfect, and you just have to plug it in and it works like instant coffee. That means, in the modern times you are all just ready to get it. And if you are ready to get it, why should you worry about the time-part? If it is quick, very good. I'm Myself surprised the way it works out. Specially in the villages of India thousands of people just get realization in seconds. Because the Blossom time has come, the Resurrection time has come. This is the Last Judgment. You have to have your realization because there is no way out. You cannot go further with it. You have to ascend. For that you cannot pay anything. This is one thing one should understand: you can't pay for it. You'll be amazed the BBC-people told me that, "Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand anything free, without payment." It's very surprising. Supposing we have to plant a seed, how much do we pay to this Mother Earth? What effort do we put in? The Mother Earth has the power to sprout, finished. You don't have to do anything about it, it just works out, the seed is ready to sprout, and the Mother Earth is ready to sprout, so it works out, as simple as that. Because this is the force that is a living force. And the happening is a living happening. Of course in the beginning of any tree there are only one or two flowers, but at the blossom time there are so many flowers who can become fruits.

Now, to claim anything about Sahaja Yoga will not be very wise, I think. Because if I say that it cures cancer, you'll start doubting Me. If I say it can cure even AIDS, you will say, "This is too much." If I say it solves your emotional problems, social problems, political problems, you'll say, "This is too much." But who has created the problems are the human beings. And if they are transformed, how can there be problems? If they all become problemless how can there be problems? But it's difficult for Anglo-Saxon brain easily to accept this situation. India had this knowledge for generations. And they had described the personality of a good guru, called satguru and aguru. Aguru means who is not a guru at all, who has no spiritual powers, who is just a money-maker or a sinister fellow or could be a devil. It's all in details is described. And 1974 in a much bigger hall than this openly I told the names of people who are agurus. But the Anglo-Saxon brain liked them better than Sahaja Yoga. They all went headlong for them. And today what we find that many are hurt very badly by them. As an Indian I feel ashamed, absolutely ashamed. On the whole, Indian mind is not money-oriented, it is Spirit-oriented. For an average Indian the highest thing to get in this world is the spiritual powers, the Spirit, the Self-realization.

Even when a child is born they forecast the horoscope, in which they will say, if will get a satguru or not, and also will it be possible for him to get Atma Sakshatkara, which means Self-realization.

So all this agurus took full advantage of your ignorance and came down, nicely settled down. But the good about falsehood is this that it gets exposed. But even if they are exposed today the harm is done. But I feel any organization which takes money in the name of God is a cult. Because it cuts out a person to know anything about others. And put the blinker not to see what you are doing. That we can see, say for example, see the Islam or the Christians, the Spaniards - the way they went to America, can you believe they were Christians? I was Myself born in a Christian religion and I was amazed at the missionaries who would convert people at the point of a gun. Is that Christianity, is that Christ? Without any feeling within their heart, ruthlessly. Absolutely without even having any conscience about it. So, what are we to understand that did Christ leave those people to spread His name and live on His name, earn on His name and build organizations?

Now we cannot blame the young people when they deny God. Because that does not prove that God is good, He's compassionate, He's kind. In Algeria there where 500 young people who felt there is no God. And they took to communism. One of them by chance came to Sahaja Yoga and he went and told all of them, "There is God. We can prove it now, the proof of God is there." And he gave realization to all of them. So, everything can be proved by the ascent of the Kundalini. This is the divine science, but for that you have to be equipped. You have to be graduated first, means you must get your realization.

Whatever has happened, has happened, forget about it. Now we have wonderful time ahead of us. We have to enter into Kingdom of God. For that is just a question of few seconds. It is that simple, I promise you, please believe Me. We'll work it out today, we'll work it out tomorrow. There's no end to knowledge. But without the eyes what's the use of talking about the colors? So let us get the divine eyes, which they have twinkle in their appearance. And then we can see how much knowledge we have missed. So far whatever we have known was non-knowledge.

Today we have to try for our Self-realization. For that I have to request you for an attitude. First of all you should not condemn yourself for anything. You should know that you are the temple of God. You should not count your so called sins. You must respect yourself and be pleasantly placed. Best thing would be to say 16 times, "I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty at all," and I'm sure it will work out.

Secondly we should not have any conception about it. Keep our minds open and whatever is the reality we have to see.

If you have any questions you can ask Me before we start the experience, but not too many questions, because we waste our time unnecessarily. Also don't ask Me questions, "What about this guru and that guru?" I have nothing to say about anyone, because no controversies. I hope you'll ask Me questions which are constructive and helpful for the collective.

Thank you very much.

Yogini: Shri Mataji, she says in order to understand You she needs to find a way to overcome her inner doubts.

Shri Mataji: You see, you have imaginary doubts. Supposing you are coming inside this house you do not know what it is, you see for yourself, you see for yourself. But one thing is you don't doubt yourself, first of all. That's all, that's all. All right.

Yogini: Shri Mataji, she wants to give You a letter.

Shri Mataji: Yes, Madam? So many questions are there. Yes, of course. Hhen can I see him?

Yogini: He's in the hospital, Shri Mataji. Tomorrow afternoon he's coming home.

Shri Mataji: All right, I'll send somebody, don't you worry. All right? What's the matter with him?

Yogini: Shri Mataji, she says the child has an illness which only 40 people have in Austria. And it's something where the whole body starts to disintegrate.

Shri Mataji: Meaning what? [INAUDIBLE] won't understand German, but disintegrate means what?

Yogini: It's a metabolism illness where the metabolism of the body starts to break down.

Shri Mataji: What's called this in English?

Yogi: It's a [INAUDIBLE] disease.

Shri Mataji: Ah, all right. It's in Mooladhara this problem. We will find out, all right. May God bless you. Such a sweet child. What's his name?

Yogini: Markus.

Shri Mataji. Markus. All right. May God bless you! All right, any other thing please? Yes, please. Please, get up, please. Thank you!

Yogini: He's done a mantra's meditation with a wrong mantra and he's got into a deep depression.

Shri Mataji: Of course you will, that's what it is, I know that. That can be cured. You should not do mantras at all. There is no need to do mantras. This is TM you did? Horrible, that one. This man made so much money out of you. Horrible fellow! All right, doesn't matter. You come along. It is easy but you see the [alternate?] what is the reason how it works out is this way that when you are not connected, say, your telephone is not connected and you start using the telephone, telephone gets spoiled. It is much more than that, but I will explain to you everything, all right. You come along.

He is such a fellow that he would give a mantra which means the 'tale of a scorpion,' inga, in our language, in Indian language, Sanskrit language. Which means tale of a scorpion - for 3000 pounds. And it was all a big secret. So you would not tell to any Indian. If you tell to any Indian he would laugh aloud. There is no Sanskrit word like that. Then he says tinga which means if you show somebody like this, you know, that is it, tinga. What is it, this thing you say? Showing a thumb, yes, can you imagine? All this kind of nonsense, befooling everyone. Useless fellow. I've said all kinds of things about him since long, he cannot prosecute Me at all, but people don't listen to Me. If he prosecutes Me I'll expose him in the courts, but he does not. None of them do that. Would be nice if they prosecuted, isn't it?

All right, don't you worry, we'll put you right. What else? There is one lady holding her hand. Yes please.

Yogini: Shri Mataji, she said when You came into the room, she felt such a strong feeling that her heart even started beating and she did not hear anything about that in the introduction. So she is a bit worried, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Such love! You must have known Me before. So kind of you.

Shri Mataji: What else? Yes please.

Question: Shri Mataji just spoke that the Self-realization doesn't take long time to understand or to know it. If Mataji explains the way of realization [INAUDIBLE] questions can be understood.

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course. Of course, everything can be explained and not only but you can give realization. You become the yogi.

Question: That's [subsequentive?] of the question.

Shri Mataji: Yes, but what do you want Me to explain now at this time.

Question: At this time the way of understanding the realization.

Shri Mataji: All right. It is a good question, you see. The way of realization is that there is a Kundalini within us. All right? That's what he has explained to you - he told Me he has explained. There's a Kundalini, the power within us.

Question: Excuse me, Mataji, the thing [what?] was explained that was in German and I'm sorry I did not understandanything.

Shri Mataji: That's not good, then you should come to My place, I will explain you everything, because it will be quite a big thing.

Question: Can Mataji give time?

Shri Mataji: I will of course, why not? The time is for you. Any time, tomorrow. You live here?

Question: I am here, Mataji, whatever time ...

Shri Mataji: All right, all right. That's an Indian, that's an Indian, you see. I know he might not have understood in German language, but it's all right, you can come and see Me sir. All right? Yes, please?

Yogini: Shri Mataji, he said you spoke about Christianity and he said that people shouldn't feel guilty, but he says that Christ said we must feel guilty, we must ...

Shri Mataji: Never, never. Never, never, He never said it, it is Paul. Never. Christ, why will He say? You see, He was crucified for us, He suffered for us, isn't He? By His sufferings all our sins, He said, will be forgiven, isn't it? It is Paul. You follow Paul more than Christ. Because Paul was a Jew and Jews did not want to believe that Christ suffered for us. All of them are following Paul, not Christ, nowhere. And Paul, who was not a realized soul, he was epileptic, he had killed so many Christians and then suddenly he is in the Bible.

All right. My child you have to be happy and joyous. Good. I am sorry, I had to say this about Paul, but it's a fact. It's all misrepresentation. To such an extent, you'll be amazed, that bishop of Durham has said that, "Christ had no immaculate birth out of the Immaculate Conception." These theologians, what are they going to understand about God? You cannot discuss about God, can you? And then he was very much honored by the archbishop of Canterbury in a church in York. And the lightning hung over that church and burned it completely, the top of it. And then when asked why this has happened, they said, "God has been very kind not to burn the whole church."

Do you know the area where the prostitutes of London live, called Soho, is all owned by Church of England? And when the question was asked to them, "Why should you own this?" They said, "We are looking after women who are like Mary Magdalena," taking their money all right. Any intelligent person should understand this is absurd. Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." And they are owning a place called Soho in London. How do you explain all this nonsense?

All right. Yes, one more. Not too many, one more there, yes please.

Yogini: She says that Christ took the sins very seriously, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Yes, He had to. But you don't understand Christ that way. For such people it's just a play. To know Him first get your realization then you will really fall in love with Him. Even the Jews who are sahaja yogis, even the Muslims who are sahaja yogis, even the Hindus who are sahaja yogis now understand Christ. They understand Shri Krishna, they understand Shri Rama, they understand Mohammed Sahib, they understand everyone very well. Christ has said, "Those who are not against Me are with Me," who are those? But He was allowed to live only for three and a half years. What can you do in this little, short time? I was struggling with seven hippies for four years in London. It's not easy. They are difficult people.

One more, please. Yes, please.

Question: How do you see the woman in the future of this world?

Shri Mataji: Great. Women should not try to become men at all, it's horrid. Woman is a woman in her own dignity. She is like the Mother Earth. She does not know her powers that's the only trouble. There is nothing to fight with men. We are like two wheels of one chariot; both are equal but not similar. A woman is definitely much more dynamic than man, if she knows her powers as a mother.

Question: What do you think about the Kundalini meditation techniques of Bhagwan?

Shri Mataji: Bhagwan? All nonsense. I will not speak about that at all because it is just the opposite. Now I'll tell you one thing, the technique part of it. That you will see here clearly, that the red spot that you see is the Mooladhara Chakra. This is the chakra which controls our pelvic plexus which also controls our sex. Now it is placed lower than the Kundalini, if you see clearly, lower than the Kundalini. So when Kundalini rises, all sex activity stops and you become like a child. You become innocent because this is the center of innocence. That's why Christ has said, "You have to be like children to enter into the Kingdom of God." He is just the opposite. Logically you must understand. Scientifically you must understand by doing sex activity, who has ascended in evolution? We accept everything nonsensical very easily but sense we do not want to accept.

Question: [inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Little bit stop because she has to translate. What is he lecturing?

Yogini: He is asking about Christ again, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: He's giving Me a lecture or what? All right. Forget about it. All right. What else? Yes?

He's gone [away?]. He came to give us a lecture or what? Now, what is it?

Yogini: He says, Shri Mataji, if the Kundalini is lifted and one of the chakras has a problem, could the person be damaged by the Kundalini coming to this chakra?

Shri Mataji: No, no. It's correct, your question is all right. Please be seated, I'll answer it, all right. If the Kundalini rises She nourishes and soothes the chakra. She is your redeemer, She's your comforter, She's your mother. She is your individual, your own mother. She will never damage, on the contrary She'll sooth. We have very wrong ideas about Kundalini. She has loved you all your lives and She is waiting for a chance to give you your second birth. So there's nothing to worry. There have been lots of funny books, I know. I don't know why they wrote such funny books without knowing anything about Kundalini. Now, last question. One. One more. One question from someone. Just a minute now, let it be. All right.

Yogini: Shri Mataji, he said he might not have problems to love one person, but when it's a large mass of people and they seem to behave in a petty way then he finds it difficult to really love the masses.

Shri Mataji: Correct. What you say is true. But you are not the only one who will get Self-realization, there are thousands who get realization. And you become collectively conscious. So you know the person whose chakras are catching, whose are not catching. And you can help the people to improve their chakras. So there is nothing like absolute bad or good for you then. And you can't help loving people who have the same awareness as yours. You must see the sahaja yogis from the West go to India in the villages, the way they hug each other, love each other and such pure love. No more pettiness left in them. No racialism, no [cast-ism?], none of these things of hatred. It's a pure race of pure people.

Now, one more, all right? This is the last.

Now we'll do one thing: You ask Me the question today, please, but then you can write, others can write the questions and give it to Me. Tomorrow, I'll answer,otherwise what about realization then?

Question: What is your relationship with God?

Shri Mataji: I think, you should not ask just now this question, you'll better discover it. No use telling. Very dangerous. When Christ said, "I am the Son of God," you crucified Him. And when Mohammed said that He is the prophet, they gave Him poison. Even in India many saints where tortured because they were saints. I want to live for some more time. So I will not tell you, but you better find out. But of course there must be, there's no doubt about it.

Can you ask, can you write it for tomorrow, Madam? All right, very kind of you.

All right, let's have our realization now because, you see, the time has come, very good time now. It will not take more than ten or fifteen minutes. But those who want to go can go. If you want to go, say, for a five minutes or so outside, you can go and come back. It will not take more than fifteen minutes. But don't disturb at the time when we are about to raise the Kundalini. And I would request you not to sit here, those who do not want to have their Self-realization, because that embarrasses other people. In any case, we cannot be forced. You must have free will to ask for it, it cannot be forced. Your freedom will be respected. But you must also respect My freedom that you don't disturb us.

There's one more thing. I would request you to take out your shoes and touch the Mother Earth, will be a good idea. And to put both the feet parallel to each other. During this time you have to keep your eyes shut. Please don't open them. Because the attention has to be taken inside, like the Kundalini when it pushes in, the attention is sucked in like this. So, if your eyes are closed it is better.

Now, the left side represents the emotional side or the desire. And the right side represents the action. So by telling you how to awaken your Kundalini I will tell you what chakras to be touched with the right hand. Which is very simple. First I'll show you and then I will later on close your eyes and then I will tell you, one by one. First you will have to put your left hand towards Me. And the right hand has to be put on the heart because in the heart resides the Spirit. Then you have to put your hand,right hand... we work with right hand on the left hand side. We put it on the upper part of our abdomen, on the left hand side, which is the left Nabhi, as we call it, left Nabhi Chakra. Then we put this right hand in the lower part of our abdomen on the left hand side. Here it is the Swadishthana Chakra. Then we go back again and put the hand on the left Nabhi on the upper portion of the abdomen, on the left hand side. Then we take our right hand to our heart where the Spirit resides. It's the Anahata Chakra, on the left hand side. Then we take this right hand on the left hand side of our neck, here, and turn our head. This is the center of Vishuddhi, which is harmed when we feel very guilty all the time. Just now it's horrible. And just now you are all feeling guilty for nothing at all. Again I request you not to feel guilty. Then we have the Chakra of Agnya here, which we press it like that with both the sides of our palm from here and here, like this. Now we put our hand back on the back Agnya and push back our head like this. Now we stretch our palm and put the center of our palm on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in our childhood. And now press it hard stretching your fingers, seven times. That's all.

Then you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head, which we will do now. So please close your eyes. Forget about the past, forget about the future. Don't feel guilty.

Now, please put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart. Keep both the feet parallel on the ground. Please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you. Now, here resides the Spirit. So now you have to ask Me a question, closing your eyes, in your heart a question - you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever suits you, "Mother, am I the Spirit? Mother, am I the Spirit? Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times. Three times please.

Now, without opening your eyes put your right hand, your fingers, in the upper part of the abdomen and press it hard. On the left hand side. Now, here ask a question in your heart three times again, which follows the first question that if you are the Spirit you are your own master, you are your own guru, you are your own guide. So please ask a question again, "Mother, am I my own master?" Three times please. With full attention, with concentration you have to ask this question.

Now, please take your hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. This is the center that works out all the divine laws. This is the center that gives you the pure knowledge. But I cannot force you, as I've told you before, you have to say that you want pure knowledge. So now please ask in you heart, "Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?" This you have to ask six times because this center has got six petals.

With this asking your Kundalini starts moving. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your stomach on the left hand side. And press it there. Here with full confidence you have to say, because this is the center of mastery, you have to say, "Mother, I am my own master." Say it ten times, please.

(Shri Mataji is blowing into Her right hand and Her left palm)

Now raise your hand to your heart again. This center has got twelve petals. Here with full confidence again you have to say, "Mother, I am the Spirit." Twelve times, so the Kundalini rises through this chakra. Twelve times.

Now, please raise your right hand, left hand towards Me and right hand on the corner between the shoulder and the neck and press it hard and turn your head to the right. Please take your hand across. From right to left. And then turn your head to another side, right side. Now, here with full confidence you have to say, "Mother, I am not guilty," 16 times.

(Shri Mataji is blowing into Her right palm and on Her fingers)

If you still feel guilty, some of you, you can say it, to punish yourself, 108 times. I've told you, you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

Now, please place your right hand on top of your forehead and here you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone." And press it on both the sides. It is not how many times, but from your heart please say, "I forgive everyone." People say it is difficult, but it is a myth. If you forgive or if you don't forgive, it is a myth. But when you don't forgive you play into wrong hands. So please put your hand on top of your forehead across and press it on both the sides and from your heart say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

Now, take this hand on the back side of your head and put your head upwards. Press your head upwards. Now for your own satisfaction you have to say, "Mother, if I have done any mistake please forgive Me." From your heart.

Now, raise your hand and stretch your palm and please put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area and press it hard, on top of your head, seven times. Now here you have to say - I cannot force you - you have to ask, "Mother, please may I have my realization." Or, "Mother, please give me my realization." Please say it seven times. Move it clockwise.

(Shri Mataji is blowing into the microphone)

Take down your hand, please. Please put both the hands towards Me. Please open your eyes. Please open your eyes slowly. Now, put the right hand towards Me and with the left hand you can feel on top of your head, is there a cool breeze coming in. With the right hand towards Me, right hand towards Me, with the left hand. Little higher, about four, five inches - some people get it here also. Higher, higher, higher. There's a cool breeze. Don't doubt yourself, put attention here.

Now the left hand towards Me and the right hand on top of your head. There may be little heat coming, doesn't matter. Little higher.

Now the right hand towards Me and the left hand.

You may put both your hands on top of your head like this. And ask a question, "Is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the Brahmashakti? Is this the divine Ruh?"

Now please, take it down. See for yourself - do you feel cool breeze in your hands? Little higher. Now watch Me without thinking. Can you do it?

Got it! Those who have felt cool breeze in the head or in the hands please raise both your hands. Look at that - Austria. Great! So many of you!

You'll feel very peaceful tonight. Don't discuss it. Some did not feel, all right - doesn't matter. But don't discuss, don't talk, anyone. In silence you go and sleep and tomorrow again you come. We'll have to give to those who haven't got it and those who have got it will get it fixed. Also call your friends. Those who haven't got it should not feel disappointed - they'll all get it. But don't think about it, because you'll lose your vibrations, you'll come down.

So may God bless you all!
