Public Program Day 2. Geneva (Switzerland), 19 September 1990.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. For those who have come for the first time today I have to tell them that truth is what it is and it cannot be organized and it cannot be understood or felt by this human awareness. Now the first question that is asked in practically in every program I have is this: how to make out a real master or a real guru. The first thing to know about a guru is through the disciples. You should find out if the disciples are righteous people, if they are compassionate or if they can raise your Kundalini. Also, you should find out if they are wise and what are the relations of these people among themselves. They have to have the full knowledge of the Kundalini and the Self-realization.

If they ask you to say some mantras then you should ask, “Why this particular mantra for me? What is wrong with me? Why this one?” But the first thing you should see that have you to pay any money for the Self-realization or for anything. You cannot sell God. And we have known that all the saints who lived on this earth or all the incarnations who lived on this earth never charged in any money for their knowledge. You cannot earn your living on this knowledge. You have to do your own work, whatever you have been doing, and you have to live happily with that money that you have. But those people who try to make money from you or ask for money, you must know are not real people.

Like for Sahaja Yoga in modern times, I must say, My husband had money. He was quite generous and he paid in the beginning for about four, five years for everything, for even My travels, for halls and everything. But when it grew up from a very few people it grew up into a large number of collective people, then they said that, “Mother, you shouldn’t pay for the hall,” and still I used to pay for My travel quite some time but they said, “You shouldn’t pay. We’ll pay for the hall because we are so many, because it is not in our self-respect that You should pay for the hall and for our salvation.” Paying for the hall is all right, but paying for the knowledge is wrong and I [will, do] not take a single pie Myself. And also somebody has asked how do I exist. Because, see, if you do God’s work then God helps you.

My husband had a very good job and I had a very generous husband also. It’s all God’s gift. So everything works out. So that is the second thing you should find out: if they are interested in your money. Then you should also find out if the guru treats people who have money, who have position, with greater interest and the people who are poor he pays no attention to them. And is said by Nanaka, “Sat guru wahi jo sathi mile hai.” The one who is, you’re the sat guru, is the one who just makes you meet God, means he just gives you realization. So they had very few disciples because they could give realization to very, very few people. And Christ’s disciples didn’t get their realization till He was there but then, as promised by Him, the Holy Ghost, the cool breeze came and gave them the realization. When you enter into the Kingdom of God it’s a fantastic world. It’s very different from what we human beings have created. It’s full of love and beauty and compassion and it is so efficient that it is impossible to believe how things work out. I mean, now we say that in Sahaja Yoga we, the miracle has lost its meaning. How you are helped and how [you, we] are looked after is the most wonderful thing to be seen when you enter into the Kingdom of God.

Then there are another questions about the chakras, that why we have to use the different numbers. Because, you see, the petals of the chakras are of that number. So we have to use so many numbers because all these petals have got numbers. If any chakra is blocked it can be cleared out. You shouldn’t have any fear about it; it can be cleared out. As I told you, we have a left side and a right side, and both of them need together to form the chakras. So the left side manifests the left sympathetic and the right side the right sympathetic. And the center one is the one which looks after the parasympathetic. If you, say, want to increase the beat of your heart, if you run fast, that is using sympathetic; you can increase it. But if you want to decrease you cannot. That is done by the parasympathetic. So these chakras that are there have got a limited energy in them. So when you move too much to the left or to the right this energy gets exhausted. But if something happens to break them then the control with the center is lost. That is how all psychosomatic diseases like cancer, we can call them, multiple sclerosis or AIDS and all these, virus-oriented diseases are psychosomatic, are manifested. And the human nature is, is not to keep to moderation. He goes either to the left or to the right. And that is why he either develops physical diseases or mental diseases, and all kinds of problems come because he goes to extremes. So when the Kundalini rises and she passes through this center of Agnya, as you have seen there, when it passes it sucks in all these two institutions which we call, on the left and the right side, as one is the ego, another is the conditioning, the superego.

Now somebody has asked Me that, “Have we to suffer for spirituality?” Not at all. Christ has already suffered for you. All the saints have suffered for you. Everybody has suffered for you. Now for you there’s no need to suffer at all. When the Kundalini passes through this center as [I, I’ve] told you, all your sufferings and all your karmas and all your conditionings [they] are all sucked [in] inside like this. Now Christ resides on that center, and that’s why it is said that He died for our sins. So all our sins are sucked in. Those people who tell you that you are sinners know that they must be the sinners. And those who want you to suffer, it is only because they must be wanting some money out of you or something like that. Like some people tell you to fast and say, “All right, whatever money you save out of your food you give it to me.” Or else they will ask you to suffer because they don’t know what to say, because they cannot give realization. They are false people; so they say, “You better suffer. You have to still cleanse. You have to do this,” and what are you doing there? There are some gurus who have big, big boxes kept, you see, on the way to the guru and you have to put money in there. And then you go and tell the guru, “I have paid so much money. So far I am still suffering”, will say, “You have to pay more.” This is all commercialization. But it is a simple thing that the Kundalini has to rise and she passes through your centers, and she purifies you and she nourishes your centers and you are all right. But people don’t want to do simple things. If you have to eat your food it’s easy to eat like this, but if they want to eat this way what can you do? You see, Self-realization is so vital today, so important, that it has to work by itself. Not necessary; it is vital. Because supposing if you have to breathe and if you have for that to go to some guru for breathing, what will happen to us? But in Sahaja Yoga you have to get the light from somebody who has already the light; that’s all. Like one candle which is enlightened has to enlighten other candles.

Now the questions are, somebody has asked about Me, “Who you...?” who I am. Now I must tell you that I’ve learned a lesson that one should never tell who you are. Christ said He was the Son of God. He was Son of God, no doubt, which we can prove also. So they crucified Him. They tortured all the saints because they were real saints. Because they didn’t have a certificate. So I don’t want to get crucified. It is better you get your realization and know Me. Because I have to do lot of work[s] still.

Then the questions are more about the sickness, and most of the sicknesses can be cured; but by your own power. Your own Kundalini will do [it]. There’s no obligation at all. On the contrary, there’s so much joy in giving realization to others. And once you get your realization in you, become a Sahaja yogi. Then you’ll go all out to give realization to others. You will never feel that it’s a trick for some, you are obliging someone, but you’ll enjoy it. You are bubbling with compassion and love. And you don’t know whom to give the compassion now. So there is no question of any obligation. It’s your own which you should have it.

Yesterday I told you there is no danger at all in Kundalini awakening, no danger at all. She is you mother. She is your own individual mother[’s], loving mother, and as your mother when She gave you the birth took up all the trouble upon Herself. She takes up all the trouble upon Herself. She doesn’t give you any trouble. So as I promised yesterday we have to know that once we get this cool breeze flowing into our hands and the cool breeze coming out of our fontanel bone area, then we go beyond the state of mental activity. In the beginning very few strands, very few strands of this energy come up like the hair, come up and get your fontanel bone area, we call as Brahmanandra in Sanskrit language. And when the grace starts flowing on your sympathetic nervous system, your chakras get relaxed, and then more strands starts flowing in, and that’s how you start growing. For that, one has to remember that this is a collective happening. Like, supposing I cut My finger, then it doesn’t grow. It’s out of My body. So you have to come to collectivity, to follow on programs, to meet other people. All you don’t have to pay, again I must say. Like some gurus will have introduction program free and then they start [pinching, clinching] money.

So then you start growing [in, with] the collective because your chakras, if they are in trouble, if there has been a problem on your left side or right side, it gets corrected. Also you learn how to, how to correct your chakras, how to raise your Kundalini more and more and how to get into meditative mood. Then also you know on your finger tips what is the problem of another person and how to help the other person. Then the compassion and the joy starts flowing and you help[ed] another person with your just hands like this: don’t have to do much; you don’t have to touch. Because you get the power to raise the Kundalini, you yourself get the power to raise the Kundalini. You become a master and you enjoy it. You enjoy the collectivity.

Every chakra which is now nourished gives you a new manifestation. First chakra is a chakra of pelvic plexus which looks after our sex. Now please notice that the Kundalini is above the sex chakra. So when the Kundalini rises your innocence starts acting and the lower chakra is closed completely, doesn’t work. That’s why it is said that you have to be like children to enter into the Kingdom of God. Sex does not play any part at all in Kundalini awakening. All those who have taught these nonsensical things have taken people into a lower consciousness. This they did to enslave people and make money out of them to buy Rolls Royces. But you develop a very sane attitude towards sex. And many diseases, many problems of sex are solved just like that without any, any medicine, without anything.

The second chakra is for your creativity. You become extremely creative. If you have the technique, say there were some musicians in India who just played before Me and they are today world famous. You can become a great artist, you can become a great painter, anything, a musician, an actor, anything on the art side, and you can really make a name, and people would be amazed how you can be that creative. But there are so many other advantages of every center that your financial problems are solved, your mental problems are solved, your social problems are solved, your political problems are solved, your ecological problems are solved. All these problems are man-created, man-made. And if the human being gets its transformation all problems [will, get] solved automatically. We have seen people overnight giving up drugs and alcoholism, overnight. I never tell, “Don’t do something,” never. In the light of the Spirit it just happens. You become very wise, righteous, mature people and endowed with the power of pure love which acts, which acts. I think in the questions, whatever were there, I’ve told you most of the questions, answered to them, which were worth answering, and I don’t think there is any more questions left that I’ve not answered as such, and only thing is that the best thing is to get your realization.

This knowledge has, know [is, it’s] a [fabulous] knowledge, and has no end to it. I must have given only in English language at least four thousands lectures. So no use telling all that in this short time. Like if when I come in this room and there’s no light, they tell Me that there’s a switch, you just put that switch and [that] all the lights will come. But if I have to tell you all about the electricity, its history, everything, you will be bored still. So the best thing is to have the lights on, because it is built in within you. All this is within. So why not have the manifestation of it? Will take about ten, fifteen minutes for the awakening of the Kundalini, and I hope all of you will. Like yesterday so many got their realization. Today all of you will get their realization. So may God bless you all.

Now there’s one thing, we cannot force on anyone Self-realization, because I respect your freedom. You have to go to the total freedom, where nothing can dominate you, neither your bad habits, nor your temper, nor any disease. So you have to remember that I respect your freedom.

Now there are two conditions for Self-realization. The two conditions are that you have to forget the past. That means you are not to feel guilty for anything whatsoever. Why to feel guilty? It’s just a myth. And if you feel guilty, do you know? You catch on the center here on the left side. When you catch that center then you may get a disease called angina or you might get what you call spondylitis, or all kinds of diseases that come from a lethargic organ. So you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

You have to respect yourself, because you are a human being, because you are the epitome of evolution. And this is the last breakthrough. Are you going to miss it because you feel guilty? So there should be no guilt at all. Moreover, this All-pervading Power of love is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever mistakes you may commit it has the power to dissolve all your mistakes.

And the second condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general. Somebody has said that, “Mother, it is very difficult to forgive people who have tortured us.” Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But those who have tortured you, you are torturing yourself now for them. By not forgiving you are playing into wrong hands. So what is the logic of not forgiving? You have to forgive. Otherwise the center of Agnya which is closed like this on the optic chiasm[a] won’t open. But when you forgive it opens like this nicely. You just have to say, “I forgive everyone.” Don’t think of every human being who has tortured you. It’s a bad thing to think about it. It is better to think [missing part] and [you, who] have been kind to us. All right.

So these are the two conditions. Now all of you have to do it. If you do not want to do it you can go. As I’ve told you, you are free to leave. There will be no problem, nothing. It’s very simple. To begin with, we have to take out our shoes because we’ll take help from the Mother Earth. Put both the feet on [the] ground properly, separately, because these are two energies. So please put both the feet separately, left and right. Now, left is the power of desire and right is the power of action. So when you put your left hand on your lap like this it is symbolically that you desire to have your Self-realization. You have to be very comfortable. I told you the modern Sahaja Yoga is extremely easy and is done sitting on chairs comfortably. It has been made easy, I should say. So please put your left hand towards Me like this and right hand [will, we’ll] have to use for nourishing our centers, on the left hand side. So now first of all [I, I’ll] show you and then [will, we’ll] have to close our eyes. You sit comfortably but not slouching like this or too straight but in a centered way.

Now, please put your right hand first on your heart. Here resides the spirit, but seat of the spirit is in the fontanel bone area or the soft bone which was in your childhood. Now you take your hand on the left hand side of your abdomen on the left hand side in the upper part. This is the center of your mastery. Now you take down your hand on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. This is the center of pure knowledge, which manifests on your central nervous system. Whatever we have achieved in our evolution has been manifested on our central nervous system. This is the word, bodha, for it or a vidha. All these means freely on your central nervous system. Then we take our hand back on the upper portion of our abdomen. Then we take our hand on our heart. Then we take it in the corner of our neck and our shoulder, on back side, as far back as possible, and we turn our head to our right. This is the center. This center is blocked when, when we feel guilty. Now we raise our hand to our forehead with the small finger and the thumb on our temples and the three fingers on our head. And now we bend our head. This is the center for forgiving everyone in general. Now we take our hand on the backside of our head and push our head upward. Now this is the center where, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your own satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power. Stretch your palm fully and please put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please put down your head and now push back your fingers nicely. This is very important because there should be a proper pressure on your scalp. Now move your right hand fully clockwise, moving the scalp. Move the scalp actually seven times, slowly, clockwise. Slowly. That’s all we have to do.

Now please close your eyes. You can take out your spectacles, and till I tell you please don’t open your eyes. Please now put your left hand towards Me and both the feet on the ground, separated. And now put the right hand on the heart. Here ask Me a very fundamental question. You may call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. Please ask Me three times, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” in your heart. Now if you are the spirit you are your master. So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and here you have to ask a question three times, “Mother, am I my own master?” I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You’ll have to ask for it. So please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now this center has got six petals. So you have to say six times, “Mother, please give me pure knowledge.” As soon as you ask for pure knowledge your Kundalini starts rising. So we have to nourish the upper centers with our[s] self-confidence. So please raise your hand into the upper portion of your abdomen and here you have to say ten times, with full confidence, “Mother, I am my own master,” ten times. I have already told you that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not these emotions, you are not this ego or your conditionings but you are pure spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and here you have to say with full confidence twelve times, “Mother, I am the spirit.”

Now the Divine Power is the ocean of pure knowledge. It is the ocean of absolute truth, it is the ocean of compassion and love, it is the ocean of bliss, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself and raise your hand onto the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your neck to your right, and here you have to say sixteen times, “Mother, I am not guilty at all.” Say it with full confidence. Turn your head to your right. I’ve already told you that whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. So for you, best thing is to forgive everybody in general without thinking about every individual. And now please put your right hand in such a manner on your head that the left and the right, left side and the right side are held by the small finger and the thumb and the three fingers on top of your head. And now bend your head. And here you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.” Say it with full confidence. Now you have to take your hand [to the] back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible and here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to say for your own satisfaction, “Oh, Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes please forgive me.” Not how many times but from the heart. Now stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of your head, and remember that you push down your head as much as possible and push back your fingers to give a nice pressure on your scalp. Now here again, I cannot cross over your freedom. I respect it. So I cannot force Self-realization on you. You have to ask for it. So now move your scalp seven times, slowly, clockwise, asking Self-realization, “Mother, please give me Self-realization.” Now press it hard, seven times. Bend your head down; bend your head down. Don’t fold your [head, hand]. Just move it, carefully, seven times. Bend your head; don’t move it.

[Sound of Mother giving vibration]

Now please take down your hands, both of them, and please open your eyes. Put both the hands towards Me like this, higher , and watch Me without thinking. Now bend your head and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. There would be hot breeze also, maybe; doesn’t matter. If you have not forgiven there will be hot breeze. Now please put left hand and bend your head again and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head, please. Sometimes you get it [closed, close] to your head, sometimes little far away. Don’t doubt yourself. Now again with the right hand, put down your head, please, and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming in. Now, please raise your both the hands towards the sky like this and ask[ed] Me a question three times, anyone of the following: “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”; “Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of God’s Love?”; “Mother, is this the Brahmachaitanya?”; “Is this the Paramachaitanya?” Ask any one of these questions three times. Now please take down your hands. All those who have felt cool breeze in their hands or on their fingertips or out of their fontanel bone area please raise your hands, both the hands, both the hands. Aah, look at that.

May God bless you all.

Most of you have felt it. Some of you did not. It’s all right. I would like to meet all of you who have felt it, and those who have not felt can come this side and the Sahaja Yogis can work on them. Must be you did not forgive. You got it. You got. No? You two didn’t get? All right, you come this side. You came today only? Is it?
