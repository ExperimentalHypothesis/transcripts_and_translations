We Have Gone Too Far Away From Our Sources

Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

When we say it is a jet age what do we mean? We mean that human beings have discovered a very unique method of conquering the gravitation force through a jet. A challenge of the gravitational force has been accepted and is overcome now. We have through this modern age created not only a jet which has a propeller. If not a propeller we have got the supersonic arrangement. But also we have got space crafts which can carry us to the moon. It is a very, very unique discovery fantastic beyond our imagination.

When I was a young girl in a school they used to calculate all the girls sitting down sometimes, how many years it would take human beings to go to the moon with the fastest plane, or at the most an aeroplane that we had in our childhood. And in My own lifetime I can see people have already landed there. We have advanced very much outside through the help of science. The outside expression has been fantastic beyond our comprehension. But the problem arises when a seed grows beyond its sources [human race ] must be it's source, otherwise it is going to die out. This is a problem of this jet age that we have gone too far away from our sources and now we must feel the force on which we are existing and we have to exist. And we must find out the very core of that source so that such a big organism because it will grow out of proportion, must survive. If not the complete destruction is awaiting us.

There are two forces always acting and interacting. One is the constructive another is the destructive. Throughout space of human beings when you are the [force ] really at the mercy of the wild animals, you will hear later on became a mighty power and now is conquering all the soil of the universe. These two forces and I call them positive and negative are essential for any growth. But it is for us the intelligent modern man to decide if we are heading for destruction. Are we doing anything to stop? Where are we going, and what are we going to give to our children? The landing of the space craft and visiting the moon? Is that all? Are these [dead buildings ] that are already all over the places? Jet age has a very big method that the responsibility of man is the greatest. When we work out together to put up a jet or a space craft we have to work out together en-mass to bring about the inflow of the Divine Power that has nourished us and is needed now for further [destruction.]

As I have told you that My knowledge is all subjective. I have not read any books on these subjects but I have had no time to do that or I don't need to do that. Of course I had to know the terminology which is man-made and artificial. But to communicate one has to know those words. With this subjective knowledge if I start talking to you the whole thing will sound extremely fantastic because we are still objects. Now the time has arrived for all of you to be the subject, to be the witness of that great dynamic force which has brought about the whole creation. When I speak to you it is through My subjective knowledge. It may not appeal to you today perhaps, but it will when you get your self-realisation and go deep into the understanding of what I am talking to you.

The creation how it was created I will be speaking later on in the senior seminar but now let us see what has happened in the days of human beings. In the days of human beings the brain has a triangular shape and this triangular shape acts like a prism. When the ray of consciousness passes through the fontanelle bone, the tip of the brain and enters into the personality of a prism which is made out of a material power. There are two powers I should say a material power which creates the fetus and the consciousness, the awareness, the [vanava] which enters into the fetus at the age of three months. While passing through the brain is the refraction. You can see in the prism that one ray that passes from the sun that reflects the sunset into seven colours. In the same way this consciousness gets refracted into three powers, three energies. One energy is to enlighten our central nervous system which is necessary to look after our bodies. The other two are the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system is not yet much known in today's medical thesis.

When I talk of kundalini I talk of the parasympathetic nervous system. One of the energies [unclear is the ..energy] the one that is the parasympathetic enters through this central path here in the fontanelle bone, passes through the centre part of the brain, through the centre of the brain which is known as [moda] in the yoga terms, which is the place where the optic chiasma is created and goes down into the spinal cord and coils in three and a half coils in the triangular bone. You can easily ask Me how do I say that but now many doctors support Me. Thank God they are also realised that they can feel this experience that themselves within their own being the three powers work. It is a velosity that is visible after self realisation when you reach the third stage I call the [sohum decha ] This kundalini when it touches down in the triangular bone. Why it is three and a half coils and all that [amazes Me ]. Of course I am writing a book. I am trying to write a book. So far I have not been able to start it also because every time I start writing I think that it will become another bible or gita. and people will start [ unclear ] and that may stop their self-realisation altogether.

This kundalini when it is settled in the triangular bone it takes charge of the fetus and it is responsible for the growth, for the entire working of that fetus and it is a Divine force that is all the time settled in that spot. This is the kundalini. The other two I will be discussing tomorrow when when I discuss all the [rhythms] of India. They are all working on the other this or that. When this kundalini - just now you have learned so far about the [unclear] of the primal roots]. It is the embodiment of this awareness which is called as prana is the holy breath, the Holy Ghost as described in the bible, who can incarnate also and has been incarnating many a times to save the whole world from disaster. This kundalini is your mother settled in the triangular bone is a very important point because this is what has caused the trouble for people who do not know much about kundalini and who are misusing their half knowledge.

Kundalini is in the triangular bone which is the muladhara as you call it and not in that [about sex] at all. This is a very, very important part of the yoga tatwa which many [have deceived, unclear, this country] But that is your Mother settled in the triangular bone to give you the rebirth. The other day a boy some the villages came to Me and he asked Me a question which you should know was very interesting. Mataji after all sex is important we have families [who are for sex ].I said “Now this is a funny statement.” But I said you want to have your rebirth. Yes he said I want to have my rebirth. Now can you have rebirth by doing sex? Can you have your birth by doing sex? He said, “No” Then I said how can you get your rebirth doing sex? Let's see. And now it is your Mother settled down in the triangular bone for you to have a rebirth and who is you are having sex like that? Can there be a greater insult to your Mother? This is so important. This is again because of this jet age this is the age of confusion where the religions and the religious [where the dharma] may be completely confused where they describe the sex with the Mother. That is why you can read many books where they tell you that the kundalini gets angry and kundalini gets into a temper and she rises and she does this and she burns you and she does all kinds of things. She will. Every mother would if she is a mother. Thank God in India I feel Mr Freud has not been able to reach out much. We still have our Mother within ourselves. Thank God that's something you have really something so great in India.. That the Mother should be brought to the level of sex is something absurd. Your Mother is even forgive you even if you kill her as a mother. But can she tolerate such a nonsense? She cannot.

In this jet age people have freedom to speak and to do whatever they like. For example if Ravenna wants to be born in this country he can very well settle down here and call himself a God and preach such horrible things to destroy all the people of this country. It's quite possible in the jet age when everybody has freedom speak and to do whatever he likes. Persons like Christ who [unclear] must have been very perverted people of a very [unclear ] temperament I think. Of course they have been discarded in other countries. But they have left their village indelible mark on the society. And in America I was shocked to see the power of the motherhood of American women is completely disturbed and is lost. They have no faith in their motherhood left. There was a [woman who had a boy who was an twenty year old who had taken to drugs, but when the child came to Me I had the child in My heart and I said to the child and I said, “What's the matter?” The child wept [ left] Listen up, I told you that my mother has never loved me like that. A mother told me that you know we have a system by which we are not supposed to touch our children like this. I said “What system do you have here?” He told Me that when the child is born he is kept away like a dog [unclear. Tied up] in the bedroom. And the children they do not know their mother so when they are about sixteen or seventeen they marry a women who is sixty year old because they are seeking their mother. Only through marriage you can have a relationship with others respectfully otherwise there is no relationship. This is what the jet age is. Because even the relationship with the Divine demands respect. What respect? It is just like the nose and eyes you have, even much less important than that.

So much importance has been given to the psychology. So this nonsense has been, is also responsible for killing the motherhood of American women. Not only in America, in other Western countries where they are oppressed They are people now who have gone beyond materialism. They are the people now who have gone beyond materialism and are seeking, but this is the only handicap of their poor children, they have not known their mother. While in our country – you know My husband was in [unclear: ] Saturday he used to get up every day in the morning, four of clock in the morning and go and sit with his mother for a while and then go out for [unclear] He would never go out from his house before touching his mother's feet. And she would kiss him on his forehead. I have seen it with My own eyes. And there the woman tells Me the mother tells Me that [unclear] I said what [unclear:sin?] You are the mother. You are beyond bhakti [unclear:its not the psychology] I call it . So the poor things now have realised and they have gone very far with the correction and they have now written many books on this but still Mr Freud is - because [unclear: attraction to] something nonsensical. People get attracted towards that and they do not want to give up that idea because it suits them [unclear] But is doesn't suit your kundalini at all, and that's why wherever you have heard of people getting into horrible experiences or getting burnt, falling down and so many are described in this big, big book they have written about kundalini are all because your Mother, which is the kundalini is never [unclear] respect for the Divine love, to the pure holy love of a mother.

Now this morning you have seen I have given [unclear] and realisation to quite a lot of people and I have done that for so many people. You all can see for yourself that sex has nothing to do. Whatever may be the efforts of the liberty to create darkness, one must know that this happens only because the Son has to rise. There is night because the day has finished and the morning will give you the blessings of the divine. In the jet age the biggest problem is of misguided sex. [Be aware I am not in the so-called sensation of the schism or the sanyata] or running away from the house and family. That is another excuse of the perverted. In a person like that you are very spirit you are attracted by this, you are attracted by that. These are the days of advertisements. Those who can advertise better are attractive. The attention has become so superficial that if somebody is well dressed we suddenly think that he is very nice. If somebody is not properly dressed we cannot see the beauty of that personality. We just cannot. We are extremely superficial in this dress age. The biggest handicap I feel while giving realisation to people is the heaviness I see of this artificial [ guilt/ filth] created. That's why in the country [ which are very ] you will find more people are coming into Sahaj, more people running away from reality. [or taking to another extreme of sanyasi ] The other day some people came to see Me and they told Me, “Mataji you are very lucky.” I don't know what to say. [and how do you [unclear] your God] you know My husband is supposed to be a well-dressed man. What am I to do? But you will be surprised that a person who is endowed with the divine it does not matter whether you sleep on the street or sleep in the best possible place. Such a person can walk for miles together without any money and can dress like a queen in a beautiful coat. But I was interested the way people are [still] so I told them, “What have you done? If that's a religion I would like to know” So they started telling Me we have sacrificed our families. We have sacrificed our houses. We have sacrificed everything. I said, “ If I am not holding on to anything what can I sacrifice”? Can you sacrifice your sleep. How can it be because it is not ours. I said who has told you it is not yours? Only thing [foolishly] you have registered here that this thing is mine. Tomorrow when you die you will leave your [ keys] and everything here all the things in this life [Christ in a manger] for again the [ before you come back to earth again.] What it does to you? Nothing. What are you sacrificing? Because you are holding on to that [unclear] idea that I have done this, I have done that, I have sacrificed a very big sanyasi you can never get to the real state that is inside. [It is what a seed for a living example that a tree grows and the vibrations inside that you can [unclear ] with the life or the energy that is working within it is just flowing. What does it matter it can – red flower or blue flowers or yellow flowers. Doing anything in the name of religion brings you, as I told you the other energy known as the sympathetic nervous system. This is right and left. The one who has got – who is a right sider, his left sympathetic is active and the right is not. Now in the solar plexus we have a problem that the solar plexus is connected with both the sympathetic nervous systems.

As soon as your attention goes on to any activity you get the sympathetic and Mother tries to pass the Mother divine has to come up through the central path that is [unclear ] is the parasympathetic. Naturally the name of religion also you start doing something and there suddenly you get in contact with over-activity leading to manifesting or, this is much more dangerous you get in contact with the [unclear] the dead. So in the decade when I was born from My childhood I was searching for a way out. For all of you who understand that you are doing nothing, it is He who is working through you and the ego is deliberately created in you to make you feel that you have to do something, and ultimately the same ego is going to take you through your awareness, through your consciousness through which you are getting your nourishment.

Now as this mind is developed fully in the same way as human beings develop, totally, completely you receive[ unclear,] you understand [unclear: the Creator] and you enjoy and can feel the beauty of love.

This connection has to be put to the mains so that you [ unclear: Sahaja Yoga] This is what the Kundalini Yoga can do. Now if you ask Me the mechanism of this mind oh its a very difficult thing. The [unclear] has that I know you are connected, I have put it to the Divine. For this you are not to sit on the fence in this jet, age I must tell you because whether you jump on the parasympathetic or you get to the sympathetic, that is you get left visshuddhi, [dead] that is the subconscious mind. [because you have put that sign on you ] And otherwise to your left hand side sympathetic nervous system which is going to give you left [unclear ]

Apart from this the greatest problem of the decade is [ unclear] but before the advent of Rama, Ravana was born and that's why Rama [ unclear had to come]. Before the advent of Christ [unclear] was born. [Because ..actually Krishna.. got his birth ultimately got his birth because [unclear] born always to kill some devils. But I tell you [unclear] because all of them are back again [unclear ] as if they are the God's men.

The other day a lady told me that Sita is a Goddess I said, '' How do you make.. She said yes she is a Goddess. I said how do you know [unclear:when you ] this woman didn't even know the kundalini and is talking about being a Goddess. The kundalini must know what you are doing, that is a sign of a Mother Goddess. Just by claiming that you are this and that. Only in the jet age money you can collect and publicity but not to transform the human beings, But who wants that? Who wants to give peace and joy to others? Who is in love with the humanity? Consisting of thousands and thousands of people being [ unclear] of their kundalini in the jet age. This is another problem of all rakshesas being born. All the negativity. All the [ unclear] start of kalijuga is awaiting our destruction. And to talk of positivity and to think a person is [ unclear] who Our mothers are much more [ ] than we are.

We have never had all these problems before. ...what has happened? Why are you running? Where are you running? Oh you have a problem with [ unclear] Because I know that I can give en-masse realization to you all and the [ unclear: source of that ] the Divine technique through your own beautiful beings and there are thousands who are negative but there are [ unclear] and the positivity is going to be [ unclear] through the system of Sahaja Yoga which I have discovered [I had not discovered it because the laws but] I did know about it how it works. [unclear ] The blossom time is there. So many flowers and the [unclear to leave that to Ravena] who will just transform them into the fruit. The whole thing is going to be live and worked out by the supreme and I am sure of this that this age of trouble and confusion will end. But please do not sit on the fence. People always say to me Mataji you [ unclear peace] I am realising that.... that you are a personal instrument of God. No. Whatever.

What are you doing? You see the real [unclear. Iconic, ]. In this jet age everybody wants to give us peace, and people are so anxious [unclear] they will not come for meditation but they will come for peace. Peace is just a [ unclear] What is it going to give you? Even the turkeys are fighting [ unclear] nothing to you because you are not realised. You cannot feel the vibrations that are flowing to you unless and until you are realised. But when I tell you people will say but how can that be? You have to get your realisation. Don't sit on the fence. You are doing the greatest offence not only for yourself but to the entire [ unclear] to the entire evolutionary method if this stays - in this age, then we will be the people who will be blamed and [ unclear:Maharashtra] If you do not get your realisation does not mean that others cannot get it. You will also make it happen. Now so many people have asked Me Mataji, “How can there be so many realised people?” Why not? Actually it has been just the opposite [unclear ]negativity just like that. Why don't you ask why should there be so many few get it and if it's that few get it? Is it that few and] that are sitting on you, why not the positivist?

The blossom time, as I call it has come. In this maya [unclear] I've been watching for the last few years and with very great difficulty a thousand people have been realised. And realisation doesn't mean that you all become a perfect man, that you all become a perfect instrument of God. No. Whatever [unclear] it is not so and you must see for yourselves whatever is there is a scientific reality. You must find out after realisation what happens. It's like a fruit that has to grow. Some people tell me, “Mataji why do you call it self-realisation? I said, “What should I call it?”

Supposing a child is born as a human being, should I call him a beast? It has to grow. And when you are to grow into doubtless-awareness [unclear: and into the .. state] But in the beginning you get the [unclear] then the inner silence is established. So many books have been written about the inner silence. Do you mean to say that it is never going to pulsate] but why this [unclear] So many people are asking to have. Do you mean to say that God can never have mercy on you?

But why this hesitation about [unclear:] Supposing tomorrow I say that there is a diamond called [unclear:] You won't even think twice whether it is a diamond or [unclear] The inner silence is established. [unclear:] So hy this hesitation? It is hard [unclear:] We have no time. People are watching their watches. This is a very good thing [unclear:] |We are saving our time.. saving for what? We must save time. We have got watches. We must save time. There was a gentleman who was very anxious to go to [unclear: London] and he told me that I must go by this time. It doesn't matter what's tomorrow. It doesn't matter [unclear] No, no you must organize [unclear] I said it's too much. So why you want to go? [unclear. I have to attend a ball in London.] He has never had [unclear: dinner party] in a society in the club as we have in this jet age. Our mothers were much more wiser than we are. Definitely. We have never had all these problems before. The way we are running, like mad people we are running and running. What has happened? Why are we running. [unclear] Why are you running? Where are you running? Or you have a problem with your vision.

Now those who [in American can learn from them] have material problems are asking for what? Of course we are [unclear] there. Such great saints have been born in that country I should say [unclear: ]not in America but most of the West countries and they have ruined them completely because they wanted to earn some money here to buy something, [ to go to hell nicely] This is what the jet age is. Man is very intelligent no doubt but he has no wisdom of any kind. He has no wisdom of any kind in this jet age. If he had any wisdom he would have known how to preserve his kundalini in it's holiness and in it's purity. Now psychology also, when we talk of symbols we must know that when you are realised born into thoughtless awareness it gives you the collective consciousness, which you must have noticed this morning when so many others who have got realisation could feel their kundalini [unclear:] this is very important. Please come and have a look at this. I'm not against cinema. I'm not against enjoyment, but you are really not enjoying this and I cannot cure you. Not even your possessions which are so beautiful. [unclear:I've seen a beautiful baby in a house] and a gentleman was telling Me I've paid so much money for this, so much money for that and I was just enjoying the painting because there was no thought in between the painting and Myself. Complete joy was vibrating into my being.

You are not enjoying even a part of the music that was played today or is ever played for you because the thoughts that are in you keep you from possessing and also make you jump from moment to moment to another places and take your attention outside. You cannot enjoy the beauty, all the creation of matter of people human beings which is the most beautiful creation which a realised person can. When a person gets realisation those who are realised when they are placing their hands on that realised soul the vibrations which created of that beautiful soul make you very happy and joyous. The joy that cannot be described and some beautiful melodies, some beautiful ragas. [unclear: of various types, various varieties]. Such beautiful human beings are being created in this jet age. And what are you thinking? Let us for a minute sit down and think what are we doing? Have we got peace and joy through these possessions. I am not against it but [unclear:poison] It's not that extreme or that extreme, I am talking of the [unclear: mahima] But when the people who have discovered that the possessions are of no use, they are becoming peaceful, extremely at peace. They are talking of giving up this, giving up that and then taking to drugs. It is neither giving up or in accepting, but expanding within yourself as you can see that you are a beautiful thing that you are so glorious and that you are [unclear] of that divine love which cures automatically.

You are the person who is asking for Divine help which is awakened to the Mother, which is waiting for some Divine vibrations to arrive first and the signal that now you can rise this love fills the gap in the man which I call as void and is physically also around the solar plexus. Without filling the being, this love, this Divine love, your Mother is not going to rise. You must respect. You must respect Her and with that respect when it is blessed with Divine love She rises [unclear] And when She rises She doesn't want to give you the slightest trouble. If you are [unclear] She stops and I know kundalini not moving [unclear] and she says Mother please cure my child otherwise I will not rise. What a loving mother you have as kundalini and why all these things are said against her it burns My heart. Your mother you have hurt. You are confused, just for your own purposes. It is better [unclear] This is satanic, this is not ignorance but absolutely positively I can say this is satanic.

Don't play into the hands of Satan and try to know that you yourself is the most [unclear:quality] instrument. What I do is just to support you into your own ocean of power. I don't do anything else. I just pour a little water on the seed of kundalini - she rises. My work is over and then you find your own. In the collective consciousness you cure people. In the modern age people have got also another idea of [unclear: after the material- other] Who is the other assisting you see I don't know. Because your attention is outside, that's why you are all separate and divided. But [unclear:] But when.. is passing through you and serious. If My attention is on my [unclear:] I'm on your [unclear: state too] Then who is the other? If this hand is cheating this hand, what is the [unclear: favour] you are doing​? What is the social work you are doing? All this doing creates nothing but acting] Why after realisation you look much more active than the person who has been active. You appear much more active but there is no space because the idea that you are doing something is completely fake. Even when you are feeling vibrations you say that they are passing. It is going [unclear:] These are your hands why don't you say that I am giving you, I am doing this? No, nothing.

So the first [unclear: thoughtless] awareness can be not like that because between the thought there is a little gap through which you can jump into your unconscious being. Unconscious because it is not known consciously thought [unclear:] God I do not mean that the unconscious state where [unclear: you call the ocean where you have no awareness of anything] That's another kind of mesmerism. [unclear:] So the thoughtless awareness as you arrive you get the collective consciousness. And the collective consciousness is absolutely automatic. You become a automatic receiver of the knowledge of the kundalini of that person and your being is [unclear: affected] by the kundalini of other people because we suddenly move into the kundalini of others.

The fear about kundalini must be given up. It's like fearing your own Mother. If you know what is a mother and Her purity and holiness and if you remember how she was a mother in Her purity would not be spoiled by Ravena. Is not suitable for American minds. No, it cannot. [unclear: is impossible] How can you ask such a thing? Like jealousy. And so many modern people also they do not think that women could be saved and men could be saved. Men could be saved it is impossible [unclear: he's a useless fellow] In a decade Rama [unclear: useless good for nothing man who cannot even look at another woman] This is what the dharma [unclear:] completely confused. But confusion is needed for [unclear:] and confusion is always welcome. In the mud only the lotus has to rise. I know after this lecture you will not just think it to be a lecture but a respect for the Mother who has tried to approach you through the loving words that please do not seek yourself but give yourself to Sahaja Yoga. There is no other yoga that is going work it out and cure you. All the other yogas work through the sympathetic nervous system. Even a person like Buddha. He went round the whole world with all sorts of [unclear] Ultimately he got tired. [unclear: and when he was lying at Her feet] In that relaxed position the all pervading Mother, the supreme Mother just poured Her blessings on him and he got his realisation. But now it is possible for you to have mass realisation.

In America it has worked wonders because I know in so many places [unclear: are born there] And also very successful in Japan and in [unclear: Jaipur]. England the problem is people are still quite British [unclear] but I am sure even there the new generation has finished off all that [unclear] But in that finishing off they have gone to another extreme. They have gone to the [unclear: all that.. But in the finishing off] . It is not what you do is so important or it is not what you think is so important. It is what you are. Are you like a little child just like a lotus come up? A person who is very serious and who doesn't get his realisation, I tell him that [unclear] It's true. You have to be a very lighthearted person. It does not mean foolish but just the play. Just seeing the play. Why are you so serious. I tell a joke that some people who were going to see My play were carrying their luggage on their head, and people asked them, “Why are you doing that?” And they said, “We are trying to lighten the weight of [unclear] In the same way they are very serious doing some [unclear: great job here].

You cannot do anything. The play [unclear] is carrying the weight inside you. The one who has created the creation and witness who is looking after you is [unclear] which pulsates in your heart is managing the whole show. This dead work will not put another dead on your head. Just be like a child and don't sometimes as you a position where you say no, no. [unclear] put the whole business at the feet of the Lord. You cannot. [unclear: in future] I am going to speak in My Marathi lecture where I am going to tell you what you [unclear] Gita is nothing but Sahaja Yoga but we are diplomatic [unclear:here I am a Mother, I am telling you] That's the cart is not behind the horse but bring the horse in front. But Gita says all right is you don't listen to me go and ride in the cart, till you reach the point and you'll understand because [unclear: wrong to put the horse in front.]

After realisation when you read Gita or Bible or Quran [unclear] you will realise that it is not that we have so far understood anything of these books. [unclear] The people who are worried about whether it is a form or it is an abstract should know that is is both. The abstract that is in you the [unclear] expresses through symbols the [unclear] For example at the mooladhara chakra is a set point. What you see is not the kundalini but Shri Ganesha. What a beautiful child. Shri Ganesha is an eternal child and by bringing that symbol on the mooladhara chakra is suggested that you have to be like a child when you come to spirituality to meet your Divine Mother. But foolish people and some of the [unclear: Ganesha] Their only thought is [unclear: spoilt] and they said like this is the kundalini. By doing this mistake they have accepted that the kundalini is lying in the mooladhara chakra . So the symbols that are not abstract or also suggestive of the abstract like the flowers are suggestive of the honey. But you have to be the bee. No use talking about the flowers or about the [unclear]

In the modern age the discovery has come to Me because I was [unclear] First time in My [unclear] life I have felt the need and I have worked it out. I went to many people who since claimed Me as their disciple because I never said a word I didn't [unclear] ask them how to impart awareness. And I found out this method of Sahaja Yoga where the kundalini rises in the centre and breaks your saharasara.

Many people will know that when you get your realisation you get the dilatation of the pupils. This is a sign of the parasympathetic nervous system. You cannot get realisation by any method but through the activities of the parasympathetic nervous system which you cannot do. You must be [unclear] This is a [unclear] there are many [unclear:] This is a process but there are many subtleties that work out. So I again request you that you think it over and do come for the meditation tomorrow and later on we are going to have meditation in [unclear: Jaipur] lighten your kundalini, your psychi and try to rise in your being through Sahaja Yoga. There is no fee. No money. In America some people told Me that Mataji if you do like this nobody will come to your lectures. I said, “Doesn't matter.” The said, “ No, no you put down some fee.” I said, “All right you put down some fee.” Because it is invaluable. What is the fee I am going to charge?
