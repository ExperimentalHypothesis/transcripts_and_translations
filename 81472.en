 (England)
I won't go all the way back because it's a very long story, but basically, I'd had a musical experience. I'd bought a saxophone, and two weeks after I'd bought it, I was trying to play along with a jazz record. I was trying to get the mode of the music that was on the record and feel my way into it when suddenly, something kicked in. Suddenly, I was playing. It was complete freedom. I was flying all over the place, playing precisely all the notes that I had ever dreamt of playing, and it was just a completely liberating experience. The next evening, I thought, "I've cracked it. I know how to play now." I picked up my saxophone, and it just wasn't there. What I'd had that evening had completely gone.

So I thought, "Now, what happened there?" Something amazing happened there, and how can I get it back? I had this experience two or three times, sometimes playing with other people, which was an incredible experience as well because you seem to enter an area where, without saying anything to the other person, you were on each other's wavelength. It was very tight. I could see this happening as well in other great performances of music. Subsequently, I've learned that all art comes from that space. It was highly spontaneous, and it came from somewhere within. I read books where musicians were saying, "I become my instrument, and my instrument becomes me, and I'm no longer human." One jazz musician was saying, "This music is coming directly to you from the Creator."

So I knew there was something that I wanted to find. I was looking into the "coolness" of the whole jazz thing—the whole cool side of jazz being relaxed, command of the situation. That led me to wonder, "Well, how do you become relaxed in that way?" So, I started looking at meditation. I was reading books on meditation, and at that time, I was reading different scriptures as well. For some reason, I started reading all different scriptures and realizing that they were all saying the same thing. All the virtues these great people were talking about—the Buddhists, Mohammed, Lao Tzu—they were all saying the same thing. And I couldn't understand why no one else could see that.

At the same time, I had moved out of London and into the countryside, and I was becoming more and more of a recluse. I was feeling that no one really was on that wavelength and was wondering what it was all about. Then, some friends of mine came down for the weekend, and they had a Sahaja Yogi in tow with them. We went down to the pub, and the first noticeable thing was that this guy wasn't drinking. I said, "Oh, why aren't you drinking?" And he said, "Oh, it's my meditation, man. If you meditate properly, you don't need to drink." I thought, "Oh, this sounds interesting," because I'd already come to the conclusion that maybe these habits weren't good for one.

Then I said, "Well, why not?" He said, "Well, it's your Kundalini. It affects the Kundalini." I said, "Well, what's the Kundalini?" And he said, "I can't tell you." I said, "Well, is it the Tao? Because the first stanza in the Tao Te Ching is, 'The Tao that is spoken is not the sacred Tao.'" He said, "Well, I don't know. I don't know what the Tao Te Ching is." But we know now that the Tao is the same as Kundalini.

So we went back to the house, and I asked him more. He said, "Oh, there's this Indian lady behind it," and, "Here, go and listen to this tape." He didn't come into the room with me; he just sent me into another room. I listened to the tape, and I suppose I felt very meditative while I was listening to it. Afterwards, he didn't say anything more about Sahaja Yoga. The funny thing about what was on the tape was that Shri Mataji was actually talking about it now being the time that the sages and seers come down from the mountains, out of the woods, and back into the cities because we were needed there. I thought, "Oh no, I've just moved out of London!"

"Which year was this? What time?"

This was 1980. It's precisely 30... well, I met Shri Mataji for the first time precisely 30 years ago last Wednesday.

"What was it like when you met her?"

Well, because I had taken quite a few drugs, I suppose I was expecting something a little bit more cosmic than what I actually got on the evening. I was expecting a lot of fireworks, and it wasn't like that at all. Sahaja Yoga is never what you expect it to be. It was very serene, very subtle. I can't say I felt vibrations. I felt sensations in my back. I felt a lot of love from the yogis and from Shri Mataji herself. But I went away feeling that something had definitely happened, though I couldn't put my finger on what. Yes, I felt it in my heart that something had happened.
