[Sahaja Yogi sings abhanga Vishnumaya Jag Vaishnavancha by Sant Tukaram].

[Refrain]

[Vishnumay Jag Vaishnavancha Dharma [x3] (The world is itself Lord Vishnu)

Tuka Mhane Ekaa Dehaache Avayav [x8] (Tuka says we are all parts of one Being)

Sukha Dukha Bhog Jeeva Pave [x2] (The individual soul experiences joy and sorrow)

[Refrain]

[Applause].

Shri Mataji: Beautiful song of Tukarama which says that the whole world is nothing but Vishnu; full of Vishnu's tattva. That is, as you know, the evolutionary power of Mahalaxmi. And that – in this to say there is a difference between one another is inauspicious. "Amangal”. It is inauspicious. What a powerful statement; to say that one person is different from another is inauspicious.

Then he says that we are part and parcel of one being. And how can we discriminate between one part of the body with another? See, these words are written all these; long time back. And they said it is not a religion to say these things. Such a great powerful statement has been made already by Tukaram. May God Bless Him.

[Applause].

All Sahaja Yoga is done by all these saints and poets and great saints of this country and saints of many countries. How they have clearly, boldly said what it was. So clearly and without feeling any compunction about it. Like say, it is inauspicious, it is adharmic to think that another person is lower or higher than you. And to treat anybody as lower or higher.

Because in this country, the [inaudible/caste] system was too prevalent. And all the saints, all the saints, have flouted it completely. Hit very strongly. (With) words.

Shri Mataji (in Marathi): [Inaudible]. Know “Manahe Shloka”? Say it, everyone should say it. Does everybody know Ramdas Swami’s “Manache Shloka”. Yes? Say as many as you knoe. And then we will recite the rest.

[“Manache Shloka” or “Hymns for the Mind” by Sant Ramdas Swami are usually a part of daily school prayers and typically recited at the conclusion of aartis in Maharashtra].

Sahaja Yogis:

[1]

Ganadheesh Jo Eesh Sarva Gunaancha

Mularambh Aarambh To Nirgunaancha

Namu Sharada Mool Chatvar Vacha

Gamu Panth Anant Ya Raghavacha

(God Ganesh, the god of all virtues and to whom the spirit owes its origin; Goddess Sharda, the goddess of speech; we bow to them. Now we will explore the way to reach Lord Rama which is considered as infinite. Shloka 1)

[2]

Mana Sajjana Bhakti Panthechi Jaave

Tarii Shri Harii Paavije To Swabhave

Janii Nindhyate Sarv Soduuni Dyaave

Janii Vandyate Sarv Bhaave Karave

(Let us follow the path of honesty and devotion. This path will lead us to Shri Hari. Let us shun everything that is condemned and do everything that is commendable with the full devotion of mind. Shloka 2)

Shri Mataji: This is advice to yourself. He is saying that “Oh, my mind. Always go after the people who are righteous. Go after the people who are righteous. And always make good dedications and good declarations. What is the word for “sankalpa”?

Sahaja Yogi: Resolutions.

Shri Mataji: Resolutions. Righteous resolutions and whichever are bad resolutions must be given up. It is advisable to your own mind. "Mana" means mind. Oh mana, please do not have bad resolutions. Always have holy resolutions.

Please recite.

[Sahaja Yogis recite, Shri Mataji is also reciting and leading].

[3]

Prabhate Manii Ram Chintiit Jaava

Pudhe Vaikharii Raam Aadhii Vadava

Sadachaar Haa Thor Saandu Naye To

Janii Tochi To Manavii Dhanya Hoto

(Let us remember Lord Rama every morning. Let us start all our work by chanting Shri Ram. Let us always stick to good behaviour. Only the person of a good action is held in esteem in this world. Shloka 3)

[4]

Mana Vaasna Dusht Kama Na Ye Re

Mana Sarvatha Paap Buddhii Nako Re

Mana Sarvatha Niiti Sodu Nako Ho

Mana Antarii Saar Veechaar Raaho

(Our evil desires are of no use. Sinful thoughts should not come to our mind. We should always have ethics. We should always know the real truth in our mind. Shloka 4)

[5]

Mana Paap Sankalp Soduuni Dyava

Mana Satya Sankalp Jiivii Dharaavaa

Mana Valpana Te Nako Viish Yanchii

Vikare Ghade Ho Janii Sarv Chee Chee

(Let us shun all sinful plans. Let us work on the plan that will lead us to the truth. Let us not always think about sensual pleasures. If our mind gets corrupted then we lose our reputation amidst people. Shloka 5)

Shri Mataji: All this is from my childhood. It is Ramadasa’s talk, rapport with himself. See, he is telling his mind, "Oh my mind, please, do not stop me. You must talk about something that is sensible, or that is good for us. Talk something sweet to others. And try to keep the company of people who talk about good things.

And all these things, I tell you, is such good conditioning on the mind that you should not do wrong things. And so straightforward saying. I mean, there is no option on it, as if. From childhood, you listen to these things and understand them. Then he says that, let your body be used like the sandalwood. Which is decreasing every time. Still, it is giving fragrance.

Let your body be used like the sandalwood. Which is all the time rubbed and rubbed and rubbed and gives fragrance and is decreasing? That is how we should work in this world.

I hope I have been something like that.

[Applause].

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Ki Jai! Adishakti Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Sahaja Yogi: You are the creator of sandalwood. [Laughter].

Shri Mataji (in Marathi): Now, it should be done. But do it quickly. Everyone must get a chance. So what will happen - then you can sing the Bhairavi at the end. There is no voice like yours. Now sing. Come, come, pick up the tune. Next, please. Please come. [Inaudible], come here. Then last, Bhairavi.

For everybody there is tea. Good news.

Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]. One more from there.

(in Hindi): Is there anyone else with you? Delhiwallahs come here; what are the Delhiwallahs doing? Madraswallahs have not performed even one song. What about Madraswallahs?

Delhiwallas come here, perform some song or other. Don’t the Delhiwallahs sing or not? Come.

[Inaudible].

Shri Mataji: He has picked up the tune.

[Sahaja Yogi Doctor Mathur presents the Sahaja bhajan “Naman Kare Barambaar Shri Mataji Ko” which he has composed].

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Shri Mataji (in Marath and Hindi): This is very nice. Wah re wah. And poetic. The poem is very beautiful. You have used very selective words from U.P. (Uttar Pradesh).

[Applause].

(in English): Very poetic words in the Hindi language. I cannot translate. But what he is saying is that I must say the "jayjaykar” (glory) of Mother. And then he says that – I mean, he is praising Me bit too much (laughter) rather apparently. All right.

So the whole theme is that though there are people who are lost and those who are people who are gone on the wrong path; You have done a miraculous obligation on all of them and we have seen it.

But the main thing is – about the theme is beautiful no doubt; as from his heart it is coming. But he used the absolutely the poetic, delicate words. See, in Hindi language also we have some very delicate, poetic words which, I do not think in Marathi we have that much delicacy as in Hindi language. And he has used all these. Just beautiful it is. Very beautiful.

May God Bless Him and Bless You.

[Applause].

Sahaja Yogi: Bhairavi?

Shri Mataji (in Marathi): Now; no let them sing one more. Western Sahaja Yogis.

(in English): You should not mind when we call you foreign Sahaja Yogis because that is how we elevate your position. (Laughter). When we say foreign in our country, means something great. Because whatever is imported is very great in India. (Laughter).

So when I say foreign, that means an elevated situation. And if used – in the village say, supposing somebody was boy, somebody came from a village used to say “foreign returned” – that was regarded as “F.R”. You see, as a big compliment for anyone who has been foreign returned. London returned was little less; but if it is foreign returned...(Laughter).

It was a very common compliment so when they say foreigners, they do not want to bring you down to the level of locals; you see you are foreigners. (Laughter). So this is our style of addressing.

So all the Western Sahaja Yogis, one more song from you would be a good idea. Whichever you think proper, about Sahaja Yoga.

Sahaja Yogis: Gregoire, Gregoire.

Shri Mataji: Any song on Sahaja Yoga. Or Mother. Any song that you have composed.

Sahaja Yogi: A new song, Greggy?

Gregoire: So it is always the same song, Shri Mataji. Because I am not a poet like Doctor Mathur. This [inaudible] has the advantage is that it is a very short one, and everybody knows it. So, perhaps we can sing it in canon with three voices.

Shri Mataji: That is a better idea. Three voices is a better idea. What does it say?

Sahaja Yogi: Well, so...

Shri Mataji: Where is that Warren gone? He must be sleeping now because you are all married. (Laughter). [Inaudible], we never even gave him a hand. So give him a hand, first of all, very good.

[Applause].

Shri Mataji: Warren?

Gregoire: Warren? Warren? Must be fast asleep.

Shri Mataji: All right. Let us have.

Gregoire and all Sahaja Yogis:

Mataji, Mataji

Your face shines like a thousand suns

You have given us

More than we could ask for

Bliss and peace and harmony

[Applause].

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Shri Mataji: So now I have called Warren because he is the archbishop of marriage bureau. So give; let us give him a hand.

[Long round of applause].

It was a very nice weekend for all of us. To be together. It was a hundred and eight persons getting married.

A very auspicious thing happened. And by God’s grace, all these marriages went off so all.

I hope your life will be smooth and full of beautiful, blissful, peaceful silence of spirituality.

May God bless you with prosperity and lots and lots of joy in your married life.

And let all others share by seeing such beautiful heroes and heroines among us.

May God bless you.

So the last one will be singing a Bhairavi.

(in Marathi): Bhavani Dayani. Do you know it? Bhavani Dayani. No?

[Sahaja Yogis are discussing with Mother, suggesting other options].

So the last bhajan is Bhairavi raga. Will be over, then we will all depart. You can rest for a while. Tomorrow morning; means already it is good morning (Laughter).

I am sure most of you will be leaving tomorrow afternoon sometime.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: In any case, we will meet here tomorrow, eleven o clock or so, for a while, and then we will say goodbye.

So many of you are leaving. Thank you very much for making this occasion so beautiful and auspicious.

For the whole Universe has to be enlightened through such occasions.

And must understand your responsibility and your behaviour and your heart. Be clean about it.

May God Bless You.

Sahaja Yogis: Jai Mata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

[Sahaja Yogi sings an abhanga by Sant Tukaram].

Sahaja Yogi:

[Refrain]

Shri Santanchiya Matha Charanavari [x4] (I lay my head at the feet of the holy saints)

Saashtang He Pari Dandavat [x4] (I lie prostrate before them)

Dandavata Dandavata (I lie prostrate)

Shri Santanchiya Matha Charanavari [x4] (I lay my head at the feet of the holy saints)

Shri Mataji: Praising the saints, he says that let my [inaudible] feet of the saint. Let me do them a “saashtang namaskara” (prostration). I am saying that now suppose, to all of you saints (Laughter). Yes, sing.

Sahaja Yogi:

Kranti pavalo sambhala uttari [X2] (I am transformed, please steady me)

Vadhale antari kshema sukha [X2] (The joy within me has reached its zenith)

Shri Santanchiya Matha Charanavari [x4] (I lay my head at the feet of the holy saints)

[Shri Mataji is also singing the Refrain].

Tuka Mhane Mazha Na Ghadata Deva [x2] (Tukaram says without my doing, O Lord)

Purva Punya Theva Odhavala [x4] (My past good karma has borne fruit)

Sahaja Yogi: Aarti Nirmala Mata.

Shri Mataji: (in Marathi)That everyone knows by heart. Sing it once and wrap up.

(in English): This is the last aarti, it will be over now and then we will all go.

(in Marathi): He knows it. Everyone has it memorised.

(in English): This was a nice song for Me because it is the praise of the saints. It said that let my head be bowed to the saint. This is what it is. I feel the same way about you all.

May God Bless You. (Laughter).

[Sahaja Yogis perform Aarti Nirmal Mata].

[Sahaja Yogis recite the three Mahamantras].

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Bolo Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Adishakti Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Shri Mataji: May God Bless You.

All the poems must be collected. And very nice poets there are.

(in Marathi): Very beautiful poems have been written. They should all be collected and tunes must be set for them. And then the tunes will be right. In the same way, the Saraf children have also composed very beautiful poems; everyone has composed such beautiful poems. Everyone should read them and give them to Damle. Damle?

Damle: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji (in Marathi): Everyone should collect their poems and [inaudible]

and give it to Damle.

(in English): And all the poetry of the Western Sahaja Yogis must be collected by someone. Maybe Gregoire organises. Please send your poetry to Gregoire in every language that you may. So that he put them together and make some good tunes. All right?

Sahaja Yogis: Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Bolo Shri Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Bolo Shri Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Bolo Shri Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!
