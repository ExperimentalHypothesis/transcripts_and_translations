Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, I have a small Vishudhi catch, you have to excuse my voice, it seems to be going around I think.This is Jerusalem chapter 4:

I see thy Form, O lovely, mild Jerusalem! Wing’d with Six WingsIn the opacous Bosom of the Sleeper, lovely, threefoldIn Head and Heart and Reins, three Universes of love and beauty.Thy forehead bright, Holiness to the Lord! with gates of pearlReflects Eternity beneath thy azure wings of feathery down,Ribb’d, delicate, and cloth’d with feather’d gold and azure and purple,From thy white shoulders shadowing purity in holiness;Thence, feather’d with soft crimson of the ruby, bright as fire,Spreading into the azure wings which, like a canopy,Bends over thy immortal Head in which Eternity dwells.Albion! belovèd Land, I see thy mountains and thy hillsAnd valleys, and thy pleasant Cities, Holiness to the Lord!I see the Spectres of thy Dead, O Emanation of Albion!Thy Bosom white, translucent, cover’d with immortal gems,A sublime ornament not obscuring the outlines of beauty,Terrible to behold, for thy extreme beauty and perfection:Twelvefold here all the Tribes of Israel I beholdUpon the Holy Land: I see the River of Life and Tree of Life;I see the New Jerusalem descending out of HeavenBetween thy Wings of gold and silver, feather’d immortal,Clear as the rainbow, as the cloud of the Sun’s tabernacle.Thy Reins cover’d with Wings translucent, sometimes coveringAnd sometimes spread abroad, reveal the flames of holinessWhich like a robe covers, and like a Veil of SeraphimIn flaming fire unceasing burns from Eternity to Eternity.[Applause]

This next, short poem, is from Milton book, the second. It's a paragraph that is wonderful I really quite love it. I think it really describes all of us with Shri Mataji.

[The prophetic books of William Blake, Milton.djvu/75]And thus the Seven Angels instructed him & thus they converse:We are not Individuals but States: Combinations of Individuals.We were Angels of the Divine Presence: & were Druids in Annandale,Compell'd to combine into Form by Satan, the Spectre of Albion,Who made himself a God & destroyed the Human Form Divine.But the Divine Humanity & Mercy gave us a Human Form,15⁠Because we were combin'd in Freedom & holy Brotherhood:[Applause]

Second last one that I'd like to do is called the land of dreams. I think we're here.

(The Land of Dreams, William Blake)

Awake, awake my little Boy!Thou wast thy Mother's only joy:Why dost thou weep in thy gentle sleep?Awake! thy Father does thee keep.

"O, what land is the Land of Dreams?What are its mountains, and what are its streams?O Father, I saw my Mother there,Among the lilies by waters fair.

Among the lambs clothed in whiteShe walked with her Thomas in sweet delight.I wept for joy, like a dove I mourn -O when shall I return again?"

Dear child, I also by pleasant streamsHave wandered all night in the Land of Dreams;But though calm and warm the waters wide,I could not get to the other side.

"Father, O Father, what do we here,In this land of unbelief and fear?The Land of Dreams is better farAbove the light of the Morning Star."[Applause]

[The Crystal] Cabinet (By William Blake)

The Maiden caught me in the wild,Where I was dancing merrily;She put me into her Cabinet,And lock'd me up with a golden key.

This cabinet is form'd of goldAnd pearl and crystal shining bright,And within it opens into a worldAnd a little lovely moony night.

Another England there I sawAnother London with its Tower,Another Thames and other hills,And another pleasant Surrey bower.

Another Maiden like herself,Translucent, lovely, shining clear,[...]I bent to kiss the lovely Maid,And found a threefold kiss return'd.

I strove to seize the inmost formWith ardor fierce and hands of flame,But burst the Crystal Cabinet,And [I] like a weeping Babe became

A weeping Babe upon the wild,And weeping Woman pale reclin'd,And in the outward air again,I fill'd with woes the passing wind.Jai Shri Mataji.[Applause]

'What the Sahaja Yogis do not like'. That is the first song he will render now before you.[Simple is singing.][Cut in the video]

SHRI MATAJI 'S TALK - AUDIO

It was such a pleasure and enjoyment to hear beautiful songs, full of devotion, by all kinds of people from all kinds of languages. All of them, though they sang in different languages, we all felt the beautiful vibrations of their heart. I always said that we should venture into all kinds of types of music, and I have told people that you must start using also Western music as a medium, to express your joy in Sahaja Yoga. If you have to reach the people, the best way is to have music as the medium. Because it reaches the heart. And that's what [why] I was very happy that today they produced very beautiful songs, not in Indian languages but in other languages. So, we should give them a hand for that.[Applause][...]
