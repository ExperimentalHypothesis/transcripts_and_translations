Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, I have a small Vishudhi catch, you have to excuse my voice, it seems to be going around I think.
This is Jerusalem chapter 4:

I see thy Form, O lovely, mild Jerusalem! Wing’d with Six Wings
In the opacous Bosom of the Sleeper, lovely, threefold
In Head and Heart and Reins, three Universes of love and beauty.
Thy forehead bright, Holiness to the Lord! with gates of pearl
Reflects Eternity beneath thy azure wings of feathery down,
Ribb’d, delicate, and cloth’d with feather’d gold and azure and purple,
From thy white shoulders shadowing purity in holiness;
Thence, feather’d with soft crimson of the ruby, bright as fire,
Spreading into the azure wings which, like a canopy,
Bends over thy immortal Head in which Eternity dwells.
Albion! belovèd Land, I see thy mountains and thy hills
And valleys, and thy pleasant Cities, Holiness to the Lord!
I see the Spectres of thy Dead, O Emanation of Albion!
Thy Bosom white, translucent, cover’d with immortal gems,
A sublime ornament not obscuring the outlines of beauty,
Terrible to behold, for thy extreme beauty and perfection:
Twelvefold here all the Tribes of Israel I behold
Upon the Holy Land: I see the River of Life and Tree of Life;
I see the New Jerusalem descending out of Heaven
Between thy Wings of gold and silver, feather’d immortal,
Clear as the rainbow, as the cloud of the Sun’s tabernacle.
Thy Reins cover’d with Wings translucent, sometimes covering
And sometimes spread abroad, reveal the flames of holiness
Which like a robe covers, and like a Veil of Seraphim
In flaming fire unceasing burns from Eternity to Eternity.
[Applause]

This next, short poem, is from Milton book, the second. It's a paragraph that is wonderful I really quite love it. I think it really describes all of us with Shri Mataji.

[The prophetic books of William Blake, Milton.djvu/75]
And thus the Seven Angels instructed him & thus they converse:
We are not Individuals but States: Combinations of Individuals.
We were Angels of the Divine Presence: & were Druids in Annandale,
Compell'd to combine into Form by Satan, the Spectre of Albion,
Who made himself a God & destroyed the Human Form Divine.
But the Divine Humanity & Mercy gave us a Human Form,
15⁠Because we were combin'd in Freedom & holy Brotherhood:
[Applause]

Second last one that I'd like to do is called the land of dreams. I think we're here.

(The Land of Dreams, William Blake)

Awake, awake my little Boy!
Thou wast thy Mother's only joy:
Why dost thou weep in thy gentle sleep?
Awake! thy Father does thee keep.

"O, what land is the Land of Dreams?
What are its mountains, and what are its streams?
O Father, I saw my Mother there,
Among the lilies by waters fair.

Among the lambs clothed in white
She walked with her Thomas in sweet delight.
I wept for joy, like a dove I mourn -O when shall I return again?"

Dear child, I also by pleasant streams
Have wandered all night in the Land of Dreams;
But though calm and warm the waters wide,
I could not get to the other side.

"Father, O Father, what do we here,
In this land of unbelief and fear?
The Land of Dreams is better far
Above the light of the Morning Star."
[Applause]

[The Crystal] Cabinet (By William Blake)

The Maiden caught me in the wild,
Where I was dancing merrily;
She put me into her Cabinet,
And lock'd me up with a golden key.

This cabinet is form'd of gold
And pearl and crystal shining bright,
And within it opens into a world
And a little lovely moony night.

Another England there I saw
Another London with its Tower,
Another Thames and other hills,
And another pleasant Surrey bower.

Another Maiden like herself,
Translucent, lovely, shining clear,
[...]
I bent to kiss the lovely Maid,
And found a threefold kiss return'd.

I strove to seize the inmost form
With ardor fierce and hands of flame,
But burst the Crystal Cabinet,
And [I] like a weeping Babe became

A weeping Babe upon the wild,
And weeping Woman pale reclin'd,
And in the outward air again,
I fill'd with woes the passing wind.
Jai Shri Mataji.
[Applause]

'What the Sahaja Yogis do not like'. That is the first song he will render now before you.
[Simple is singing.]

AUDIO

It was such a pleasure and enjoyment to hear beautiful songs, full of devotion, by all kinds of people from all kinds of languages. All of them, though they sang in different languages, we all felt the beautiful vibrations of their heart. I always said that we should venture into all kinds of types of music, and I have told people that you must start using also Western music as a medium, to express your joy in Sahaja Yoga. If you have to reach the people, the best way is to have music as the medium. Because it reaches the heart. And that's what [why] I was very happy that today they produced very beautiful songs, not in Indian languages but in other languages. So, we should give them a hand for that.
[Applause]

It's already described by Rabindranath Tagore, that such a group of people, such an assemblage of people from all over the world will come and sing the praise of the Mother on the shore of Bharat. And that's what you can see how this great seer has seen the vision of this great day. Also William Blake is another great seer, who could see so many things which are unimaginable. He wrote about a house that we bought in Kensington, near Kensington. And he said, "It is on a brook". So, we dug deep down and to our amazement we found that it had no foundation. The whole foundation was on the two banks of the brook. And down below was nothing but sand.
He described so many things about the first ashram we had, that it would be a bombed place it will have a big gap in the wall, quite a lot of details. And the foundations will be laid there. We didn't know about this. After the foundations were laid and all that in that part, we saw how in details he talked about it.

So, these are all great visionaries. Also, C.S. Lewis has described our procession in such details! They were great seers. They are poets and when the poetry in its imagination reaches the reality, it can do so many things unbelievable, that it exposes the future of the people who are seekers, about countries, all kinds of things, they have described in such details. One thing, in Sahaja Yoga, is that people are really becoming poetic. Even when they speak, I find this poetry which is the sign that you are becoming subtler and subtler. And this subtlety in your expression, in your talking, in your appreciation makes you much higher than the rest of the world.

Today's program was another great enjoyable because we have a new party from a place where I was telling that you must have some poets and musicians in Haryana. Haryana is regarded as a very [Applause]
Gross place and also, the people. are regarded as extremely blunt sometimes and could be very harsh. But what I found in Haryana, that deep down, there is river Yamuna flowing.
On the shore of Yamuna, so many poets were born, and how many people have written poetry, whether they were in Kashmir or in South, anywhere. So, this river has an immense capacity to create beautiful music and beautiful poetry. The whole place is so beautiful, where we were in Yamuna Nagar, that even an ordinary person, who doesn't know much of poetry, may start composing poetry.
But I said, "You must get some good musicians". Really, we see now there's a group which has been formed. It has come up. Last year, I said it. This year, there was a big group of these people from Haryana, playing so well that you enjoyed and danced all. So, things are working out in such a beautiful manner in a very subtle manner, where it was not expected. There we find such a beautiful source of poetry and such a beautiful rendering of that music. All this is just an expression of the Divine power working through us. It is working in many ways. And when I find you so happy and joyous just forgetting everything, dancing together, singing together, even without understanding the meaning of the words. The way you are appreciating shows we are all universally connected with each other.

Then our hearts are open. Now nobody thinks of competitions surprisingly. Today they were all singing, adjusting themselves. Nobody felt in any way small, because somebody sang only 2 songs, somebody sang 3 songs. Nobody. And they were all joining. If somebody is singing they will join. And if that person stops now, the others will join, and he will, when start singing, another new person, the first person will start singing with him, with the same enthusiasm.
So, sort of, such oneness is there. Otherwise, you find among musicians, there's cut throat competition; terrible things are happening. Say, we don't feel that way. We all think we should all sing and dance Whoever is singing is all right. There's no identification with your countries or with your own training or your music or your own poetry even. That is the one is the sign that we have really come up to a very subtle state of mind where we are really universal.

It's very nice to see so many people over here who are Sahaja Yogis. Really, I can't believe it. It is never thought by me, that in my lifetime, I'll be able to see all of you. But it has worked, you are all here, But it has worked, you are all here, and each one of you can bring in at least thousand people to Sahaja Yoga.
Just thinking all these [applause]
Of course, it's true that you cannot force but what is going to work out is your own character, your own behaviour, your own personality. When people will see you, they will jump at you. They'll think, "What s of these angels are? How are they so angelic?" And the reward will be tremendous. So, what we need is ,of course, meditation and little introspection. But in meditation, you'll clear out even without introspection. Meditation is very important. I'm happy they have a program of meditation in the morning, and more importance now is paid to meditation. And I was- they suggested that if you sleep early, then we can get up for the meditation in the morning time. It's a good idea that we should finish our programs early. And confine it to some time. But meditation you must do. And this collective meditation is going to help you very much. It’s already predicted can you imagine? It is already predicted.
So, this is all working out with the help of Param Chaitanya which is around here. It's so beautiful that atmosphere is so filled with vibrations.

So, all of you should meditate in the morning time not half asleep: wash your faces and then sit down. And do it with complete surrender and devotion. It is a kind of respect you must pay to your meditation: you have to sit properly, to wash your face, it's a thing that you are now assuming your positions in the kingdom of God.

I'm just telling them you have to meditate and you are here only for meditation actually. And this music and all that should lead you to meditation. When you are getting into meditation, always try to be in thoughtless awareness. You must establish that thoughtless awareness. That's very important. Because in that condition, all your ego, conditionings, this, that, all these thoughts will stop. And that, you will establish yourself in the present, and you'll grow. So, all of you should do it and is the best by which on your nerves, you see, this new dimension will grow. This new dimension of your spiritual powers will grow. So, meditation is the most important thing for a Sahaja Yogi to grow, to become what you are, really, in reality and the totality. It's so much of, within you, so much; all has to be brought in and has to be given to others.

None of the saints ever went to any university or college or anything. But the way they have written poems and things are so beautiful. The way they have expressed about God. Dnyaneswara never went to any school or college. But at the age of 23, he got into samadhi. And in that short period he has created such beautiful books! I use it as a very soothing medicine, whenever I find that I have to read something that will really sooth me, I read him. So, all that he has written is nothing but about the experience the 'bodh'. And so beautifully he has written. He has brought the whole thing to a level of a very high, highly evolved personality. So, in that way, you all can do it. You all can do it. Only thing is that please put your attention to meditation in the morning. All of you can achieve a very great height. I know you are all capable of that.

All this you have got, because of your previous lives' ‘punyas’. And also this life’s ‘punyas’, and your seeking. But furthermore, it's important that you all should meditate. I hope all of you will be enjoying your meditation every morning.
May God bless you.

[Sahaja Yogis say: Bole Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!]

So, tomorrow we'll have other music like Noida and from Delhi. All kinds of music we can have. And also Babamama is arriving, I hope so.
