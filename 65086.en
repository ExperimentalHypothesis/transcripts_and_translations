Evening talk and bhajans after Puja

(Inaudible) Moreover, where ever I went people used to say am I Spanish or something. I used to wonder what is so similar between Me and the Spanish women. I think the love in My heart is expressed on My face, perhaps. In the same way, I hope the women of Spain become loving and affectionate towards others.

One thing we have to realize that Sahaja Yoga is Love and Divine Love, and it is not attachment, it is not possession, but it is a giving love. It is not love of the flesh. It is not love of any material thing, nor is the love of your faith, but is the love of the Divine. This (inaudible) if you really try to witness everything in its reality and see for yourself that how and why are you attached to something. Once it is discovered, that we are detached in our witnessing state, then automatically the pure love starts flowing. As soon as you get your light, the sunlight, all the fog disappears. In the same way, as soon as you get Spirit shining in your attention, all your doubts, all your mistakes, disappear.

This is what I told you today that you have to be aware of yourself because now you are friends of your Self, your Spirit. So, when you are the Spirit, you are like a brilliant diamond, which is giving light by itself. So it is important to understand what you are, what others are not, and this awareness should be a... some part, innate part of your being. Then only it will act and permeate into the atmosphere and into other people. I hope when you go back to your countries you will give My message to them that we all have to be aware of ourselves. If you put dirt on the diamond, it won't shine; but that has nothing to do with the shining of the diamond. If you remove that dirt, you will shine brilliantly.

For that you know what is to be done, is to witness yourself. If you are so... still right sided or left sided, see for yourself and find out what's wrong. Just clear it out. Just do not accept it, do not accept it, because this dirt and filth is covering your diamond. This is what we have to understand in Sahaja Yoga. Then once you shine with that brilliance, nobody has to say with a vow that it is a diamond, you are. Nobody can doubt that brilliance. Nobody wants a person who is fake, who is impure, who is unrighteous, to talk about God. Everyone wants reality. Only thing is that they should see reality in you, or you should manifest your reality outside. The first one is not in our hand - to make them understand reality. But the second one, to manifest reality, is in our hand.

Now, for example, you have seen whenever I travel and arrange a program, there are thousands of people, everywhere. In Italy they just saw My photograph and they came to My program. I do not proclaim anything, I do not promise anything, but they all came. The reason is, they are sensitive and they can see that there is genuineness in this face. Whatever is inside is expressed outside. If you are not genuine, it shows outside. That is why the inner life should be made a big, big brilliant light so that we can make people see reality. With so many lights, I'm sure they can see the beauty on your faces. In Rome, when you people were singing, one old man came and said that, "I can see the light on their faces." And you can see - there's a picture - that there's light upon everybody's head.

The other day I saw one painting, El Greco has done a painting where he showed Christ's disciples being blessed by the Holy Ghost, and all of them had light coming out of their heads. They were so very few. But you are so many and all of you have got light on your head, which is guiding you, which is looking after you, which is loving you, which is showing you the path. You should never feel that you are alone. But try to keep yourself clean because this light may disappear.

May God bless you.

I'm sorry I have to go tomorrow morning to London and I'll be traveling many countries. For three months I'm already booked. But you carry this message to all your places and let Me see what effect it has on them when I visit them next. Last of all, let us give a hand to JosÃ© Antonio who is working hard to bring Sahaja Yoga to Spain.
Thank you, all of you, all the people from Spain and all the people who have come from outside Spain, for bringing Sahaja Yoga to Spain.

May God bless you.
I really have to go now. So, who are all coming with us?
