Those people who tell you that you are a sinner, you are a criminal, they are totally in a mess.

Now....Now keep right hand towards me; You must bow your head. Definitely. Bow down your head and right hand towards me. But you are alert completely, not unconscious. Now keep both the hand towards sky and ask one question out of these three questions ask one questions; you can call me Mother or Shri Mataji; in mind ask in mind- Is this Paramchaitnya (supreme consciousness)? Ask this three times. Second questions you can ask this time is Ma is this the power of God’s love? And third question you can ask – Mother is this the Ruh? Is this the Ruh which talks about being Ruhani (Spirtual)? Is this the Ruh? ask this question.

Now put your hands down. I am getting a cool breeze from you people. You are amazing people. People who have cold or hot air coming from their hand, palms, fingers or the top of their head, cold and hot air coming; Know that you have established a relationship, a connection with this power that is spreading all around. Like its (mike) connection if not with main (switch) then it is of no use like that we were but now the connection is done and it will flow all the time

People who have felt it: have experienced it, raise both your hands. (Seekers raising hand) Shri Mataji saying Wah !Wah ! To this Lucknow, to the people, Namaskar !. Now you have become saints. You have become saints, now don’t go back.

A little courage is needed; a little time is needed to be given. The most important thing has happened, amazing.

Seekers: Shri Mataji ki Jai (Hail Shri Mataji)

This is what I saying, when they play song and you clap then vibration are opened by clapping.
