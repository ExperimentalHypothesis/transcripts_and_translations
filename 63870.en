We Sit down.

He Yes. Look at things So you are a community of the? I think so. No. Sri Mataji, uh, but I, uh, I think Maggie should translate for you because most of them are speaking German. Maggie, are you there? Thank you. Yeah. Yeah I speak German. Yeah.

Hm. Yeah. She's here. It's all. That's all. But the first thing you must have is your realising that. Now this child is a bonds. This is skin ly and you can feel the vibrations of the child. He's a born and how would you know he's bonized or not? So once you get your realisation, then you can say that who's realised who are everything because you become the absolute.

So. Now this uh you can book that. I. That ain't so fucking. And try. You do get your relaxation, but it has to be run. Pran when it gets enlightened, then it becomes ran ran when it gets enlightened. But is the right psychology, right. I created. But I was.

Why relevance within us. But. It is the right side of me. It is the vital side for our physical and mental being. Pravimusse louisi kraft rechteelement. And the channel that works it out is Pingal that is only one side. This is about I if you go too much on the right side. Then you neglect your left side. Which is the site we call as again look I'll make some. So is the emotional side as they call hello, as they call it man.

They thought that you have to resolve Prana into Manasa. Minranayama I see does manrana in Manassa alflous. But the problem is before realisation. It is No Advisable to follow any one of these patterns because first we should know. What is our property? What is our nature? Every individual has a different nature. Uh but there's probably is for absolutely show is this kind is a good day. I know from this um uh ide and alenge signa eigen natua men. Say for example, people in the west are right means they're overactive.

They are futuristic. They plan a lot. They are physically and mentally equipped. The high seasoned uber actives decline in that season cruises uh adult. So the right side which is the suria Nadi. Was practised in India. Long time back, as you must be knowing, to the way that also they talk about it and the and then they just wait to see our point is too young. Now the thing is in the west, if you are the right sided person. Then to give yourself a balance, you have to be a left sided. You have to practise left-sided things.

able to link if you are left sided, then you must practise right sided so the balance is established. So in olden days, you see, when we were. Trying to seek the truth, the saints, the sages. They found that the people are mostly, mostly. Left sided conditioned. In we. So they started the system of anxiety, the right side this is the same. So in the way that you find the five elements are very important. And Prajapati means the rama was the creator of these five elements. Or he don't know what they call him when he eats.

Uh, who got realisation? Well, I'm a side ulcer that is absolutely common heart, but Janica really took his lots of tests. Without that you won't give him realisation. It is all described how he took his test and then he gave him realisation. It is we are in the tested attack on our saner we gave him that. Now And among you, there may be some people who are right sided and maybe some people who are left sided. On in and give this leroy. And you do not only belong to this life. You have had many lives of So firstly we have to see a balance. Uh, to be given, and then we have to see.

We have to see how your chakras work out, come into balance, and then you get your realisation. So I recently and like total and then the show by the chakras, 4, and then some of these from the. That's the, that's, you see, you will come into a complete balance. And then the kalin will rise, but it takes hardly any time to make your coolerin rice. So as I say I'm total like to come and then this is. pretty cool you need some outside now when the funaini rises. She establishes a balance without the balance like left and right in your. Spinal cord can cut out the centres. Like this might go to the right or to the left. It cuts out the centre left and the right.

Like that to me. The mankind can see candi by the site and funding centre and Alan and the Makundalini alte ye visuaman. Now when the kalini rises, she establishes the balance, otherwise she can't rise, but afterwards, you have to establish it yourself cooperatively. Wendielini Alsteiglisani nisteigenn of Christian is musi Mirren lies to Aus then. Once you have got like this, then we should see if you have to do rana or you have to some do some Vama or what yama that has to be seen after you've got relaxed. We done it deserves to be shower of yama or the oxy and Sara to your system. See how he's enjoying with me. Yeah. Yeah I see, I see now. They're very sweet.

There are so many children born everywhere who are realised so. It's out the bottom and tell you to say listen. Now for example this child is more on the right side. This is after the rest, and the people who are on the right side become overactive. Delo of rest is in very active. Not only that, but they developed all the problems with the right side. If not us, sometimes how how the problem is the rest resting. So you see, you have to first of all, like a car has to move. The car has to move to see whether it requires the brake or the acceleration. So chances and ask the bacon.

I'm done Chai of Sars over the over the premises. Moreover, when the car goes to a different gate, then it will know what is to be done, how to open the gate. But before the car has started moving, how can we decide it beforehand? And when there's concern and talk on them let us listen. We out. Our canine before the auto and the time had to be taken on to this for the common. This is common sense. This is one that is why anything that you do, you must do it first of all with. Attainment of the absolute point. So that relatively you have discussion what is to be done.

They say Alexaimachin who it as that absolute ari to mix it down and ha canon discriminum next to it. So that all your activities get related to the spirit. So with all ear actually taken in so. Now realisation has been very difficult. I know that. Because some crisis. And there have been books and books about it. So you look for. But time has to come where the, the, uh, seekers have given their realisation. It is their right to help.

I will excite much common for the lore that a common. That time has come. And decent sight is quite common. And this time distribute. On this side is out for herbicide for me. So according to time, as they call in to Samiiata. They practised various types. So to this she inside I'll send, how is she a technique in your case? How the human beings were depending on the on the property, the nature of human beings is a. And the modern surgery.

It's nothing but a simple. Uh, my. Which I felt that first. Give them the realisation. yoga it's no OK I'm finding I mean and this is delighted he gave this lamb. It's dirty, so we go on cleaning it, cleaning it through Payama other things, cleaning it. Spencer is a lamps can put in and put in the yama or the. I Thing could be you first put the light off. I'm sharp and then clean it and the time is not have it. You can see it better than the first, and you can do it easily on the side.

I won't have to tell you, don't do this, don't do. That you know like human nature is very funny otherwise now they're getting a snake in their hat. And you see the snake and you say throw away the snake. They're not as long as they don't see the snake themselves, they will never try it. They'll argue with you. So we didn't strike till the snake bites them, they'll be carrying it. And what's the use of throwing the snake when it was done so because they are in ignorance and in ignorance don't fight. So now put on the light and tell them see what have you got in your hand. They can't do it anymore. That is why in this our first real vibrations you judge yourself.

You better be your own guru. I go, so there's no blame on me. This is the method which we call too many Sahaj means spontaneous because it's a living process. Karini awakening is a process of a living. And also it means such means easy. So. Somebody asked that they think. In the 16th century called Ramdasa, how much time it takes a higher like a row. He said that that is the moment, that moment in, but he put a condition that the disciple and the guru should be equal. The one who does that should be equipped as well as a disciple, but here disciple, no condition.

But the disciple and the master both should be equal. That was the condition it was That's it but here. yoga. There is nothing like such a condition. I've been so keep this kind of social. As long as you desire to be realised, you'll get it. I think yeah, if you take him out and you're right, you know. What's the matter? Are you all right now? huh?

I think so. If you take him out for a while, he'll be all right. Let's see more oxygen. the door. So now, with this, you asked me that question. Yes, I'm afraid we didn't explain ourselves very well. The breathing we practise is not ranayama. It is, uh, as a matter of fact, I, I don't think it is the system at all, uh, it is concerned more or less there's a certain amount of gothfulness to start the breathing in the circle. And after that, the circle takes over and it spontaneously moves to the left to the right, up and down. So actually we'rene the concern divide up or down by the by the circle and then circle does whatever it has and I think uh.

The thing happens spontaneously that it cannot take. It cannot spontaneously cannot take. The reason I tell you why. Because the person Uh, it is It's importantly also bad luck to us because this is a compulsion in in any yoga in any unit that a person who is a real eye so. Only 10 with. And that he should be quite. Uh, Quite an expert to do the job. Otherwise awakening cannot take place. You may be cleansed up, but awakening can only take place in a person who is enlightened and of a very. Perfect.

Uh, condition. Now this has brought us bad luck also because every everybody you see is talking big, uh, this thing that thing, you know, from India, you know how many uh thugs have come here, but also it's a fact because one light which is enlightened, can only enlighten another light, but that doesn't mean you are obliged, that doesn't mean you, you are in a dominated. Nothing of the country, but it's a catalyst. That's is a guru, which enlightens one life for another, but in inside we have no good watch. Because the enlightenment takes place, you become your own guru. There is nothing like a single guru, but once you have reached a certain stage, what we call a vials. Where it is doubtless awareness is a state, is the state of your awareness of your consciousness when you reach that state. That You yourself can be a brother. You yourself can, uh, everything you can cure people, you know everything about it. You're very knowledgeable people because the knowledge is all within it, but the door has to be open.

And it is such a system in which the enlightened soul can be sub guru is the one who is an enlightened soul. Why Raha Janaka had to do for Nachike Nachiketa could not do it himself. But that doesn't mean a guru takes money from everyone. He dominates everyone, tortures, it's not doesn't mean that, not at all. A guru is a compassionate person, but here I'm not a guru, I'm your mother. My mother, you know, is always a guru. What she is a compassion, not only that, but what is the, what is the. The desire of her mother is always that her children should get all her powers and they should shine more than I. That's what she wants. What does she want?

Yeah. Let me do it. Yeah. the common seal the dimension. perfect. It has, it has a very big snag in it, no doubt, because, uh, as I told you yesterday that about only 100 years back, it happened that people started describing a funny method, a new method as just the part. It is nowhere mentioned in the whole of this. This is. In the whole of Patanja, it's not mentioned. It's traditionally nobody knows about this only about, uh, uh, this word I came to know from people who were suffering from troubles from their gurus, and they told me this word.

I said, Where is this word? You deloited it's a common sense I under a guru one this is formosisin man. So this is some new style of thing people have started which is actually a tantric stuff is a stuff by which you get possessed. Does he signs and harm. Does he signs his address. The gentleman who wrote a book for his name was Vishnuir who was, I think, must have died about 60-70 years back. And this fellow was really absolutely in the wrong lines because he's just started a new sort of appeal and a new thing appeals to the right side on this one. So this is this problem you see whatever. Your city is based on tradition. We have come from amoeba to this stage like this electricity has developed through tradition of search on electricity.

So the gardens and so it has no relevance whatsoever. This no a kind relevance kind of. It's a, it's a movement which just attracts the subconscious to play its part the spirit or the supraconscious that is the right side or the right. I'm a student. Uh, we can say that certain people use the left side. Some people use the right side. Manolo. So that's the position and so and resy or a sy does not. Posses and this with this position, your physical, mental, emotional beings hurt physician mentality. It is if it is the left side.

If it is the left side, if it is the left side, movement of that thing when he, when he offer some sometimes after link, but if it is the right side, then a person himself doesn't suffer, but he addresses others. He becomes very ambitious. He thinks of himself and he goes on like a malignant cell. So this is what it is that we must understand that the whole thing has a science behind it. It has nothing to do with only Indian philosophy, all the great. Profits and incarnations have talked about the Pundali. The this is this is er grows prokundaliniro like mamachana who calls kundalini as asses. Mohammad Satikundalinius and he said that in the resurrection time your hands will speak to that. That is exactly what happens in yoga, that your hands start speaking you through your chakra. OK now does see it in sha yoga?

Does it aer to hear in chakra's expression. Now has talked about it. Now say at that point Confucius of Confucius, Socrates. That you are to be born again has been said very clearly by Christ. Socrates and Christus. Now in the Bible, what we hear about the Holy Ghost is the one is the. That was here in the Heinekegeist her. This is Kundalini. Now in Sergio we can prove, we can prove actually. The existence of our centres, the existence of all these incarnations in us, it can be proved.

In yoga can existence is kalini in. It is no movement to the darkness. Um, I'd be here. Vivien is is kind of a vehicle in the fight. How we prove it now, I tell you, supposing I say that Christ is on the Agata. We devi somosagi in and does Christo after Agaraist when the kundalini rises. If she stops theagia. You have to take his name and the Kundalini outside and see like by the Aakashte mussen chrystals. Now if the kundalini stops at a particular sector. Then you have to take the name of the deity on that particular centre.

This is the knowledge one as well. That's all. And by centrum they employed the muscles in for the rare. Now supposing this finger. Is maybe these the fingerprints. Now this represents the navi. That's what presented the naviaka if you see the back of the person. You will be surprised that at the navi centre, the the vertebrae will be out. Out of place. Benzy uh these are mentioned and and then the rash sign Kasua soil of this and incliner, the, the person who's suffering from liver, for example, if you see the back side of such a person, you'll be amazed that the spinal cord will be uneven and will be jutting out.

Now if you know how to give it a proper head. Can you listen this is very helpful canon. Then, then you can improve that centre and the kundalini will rise. The id is a from the kalini. So it is a process which proves all the incarnations, all the scriptures and all that so far has been said about our evolution. So it's a sign process does the deviceki the other descript it can the profate Als are for. And about this is written in a book called Nari byrobahui who lived thousands of years back, who was the pioneer of astrology. And this is for Heideon therefore. That such a thing will happen, that the Fundalini will rise spontaneously, and people will get that realisation. It's a great description.

It's a complete book, but that is what is happening. If you happen to read the book, if you can get it, I don't think it is. You will see that all that is there is. So the surge also means effortless. For example, there's a seat. And you want to sprout. So get on salmon salt. Now the mother earth has a capacity to sprout. The salmon and to sprout is the nature of the seed. On the salmon's sausage freeze.

Now when you put the seed in the mother earth, you don't do anything. It just stops like in the min says Sriwi liner. You are all liquid. So why do any of you have done Raam and last lives quite a lot. There's no need for it. You are not seekers of today. You are seekers of is it need fun this is fun. If you can eat this way, why go round and round. so that as a as a mother, I say I've done the cooking. You better eat if you are hungry, you'll have that in essence even if you are not hungry, then you'll ask me how I cooked it, how I bought it and all that.

Now this slide uh say is here. Uh, if you want to have it on, you'll just switch on there and it's, it's on because it is built in that way. He li is here because his I have listed in the I'm so is so angry about this. But supposing you say first describe to us how electricity has come and how then what is the history of electricity, it would be boring. It's already there. Just panic. for you you don't have to bother. I've done everything for you. This is to end. There is no need because you're all ready for it.

There is no need right here. Now let's have it. Let's see how many are you feeding the food. That's that's the end so. This is the Titan. This is the Prannova, not the prana. Prannova is the one where the prana is light. The is trianiumranava does is the alloysis. Yeah. You it Hm.

All right. Are you feeling Just feel. If you don't feel it, you must have. It is you who has to adjust. Nobody asks, just see on top of your head. should come out of your head, yeah, should come out of the a little high, little high. Piss off so you can see her. It's called to him shines in well in the. There So it's very oops, put your right hand and we see with the left hand. Let's with the left hand.

It feels better with the left. Because right is heavy, I think. Now ask a question in your heart. Is this Pranova. Is this all pervading power of God? Is that the Alistairring in the craft godess. Is it that the Holy Ghost? Is there a highly a kind. You can keep your eyes open. It's all right.

You are in thoughtless awareness. You are in in need to charge somebody already, huh, now done. See, now listen. After realisation you have to do practise. Not people. Now the las. With understanding, with discrimination, with knowledge. practical math meet for mid first time mid discriminar, mids. Not happen. you know how old is she?

Most of you have right side problem. Put left side is left is way to the, uh, sky, the right hand you rest your hands in the wrist. you like. But. You have Little Bonnie. That's it. I said dogs are buying. Now don't be worry. You have to be pleasantly placed about it. You are entering into the realm of the divine.

Ma. Ah, say one thing. The mantra because this centre is patchy. Yeah, it is. Mother, I'm not guilty. Put it in your heart of hearts, not to feel guilty at all. You are a saints. I'm just forgive yourself, but science is even not yet science is. It. What do you say.

Forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive. 3 times a year. I like. Silent. You have to forgive, madam, forgive everyone. Was for you. From your heart, just forgive them. I know because you're saying nobody can understand. But you are not so badly off. Imagine the saints of the past, how much they suffer.

That science man for help and advice is for heart deloit fish on the higher. What. To get home. So now I have to go to the programme. It's mostly some programme. Can you just see her how precious. She's all right, little upset. You see, don't talk. Ian beach, she has. Left to the right, just put it.

Not to be anxious at all. Yeah No. OK That's for data. Now see, are you feeling it now better? That's all right, so it's the size of the device. If you can master it, all of you. Everyone can become a great master is in shock that's when you can and and meister one canonmeister upon. So we have here I don't know if you have books in uh uh this thing or something and they have some follow on programme here today I'm going to talk about the spirit. Better come to. You have to speak up and do the guys just.

They gonna be both.
