[Talk after a musical concert; Yusuf Ali Khan on tabla and maybe Prateek Chaudhuri on sitar? ]

Please be seated now.
It was a very great music program, I must say. He always says that whenever he sits before Me, he gets ideas very creative, and he just doesn't know from where they come. That means there is a divine reception, otherwise I don't do anything to him. [Shri Mataji is laughing]
Also with you people, you being all enlightened, there is a beautiful rapport. Such enjoyment, and such understanding, is not normally seen.
He has been playing all over the world, but he told me he has never seen such an atmosphere with so many people absolutely at peace, and listening so beautifully. Always I have seen all of them, all these musicians, they find a great rapport with Sahaja Yogis. And this is how this music is so much different what I know of.

I am very sorry to see now in India, people have taken to very cheap music, young people. This Coca-Cola culture has also entered into India. Thus, you find young people taking to very, very frivolous, useless music. In my own experience, I have seen, those people who listen to this ‘hard music’ are affected in their brains. There were three students who got affected and I made them gradually understand Indian classical music. They were all failing in their classes and were good for nothing. But they listened to Me and they are absolutely cured and they all got first class notes.

So, this music is- raises your Kundalini also, and purifies you. It soothes your brain. What you saw of Swadhisthana, can be neutralized by this music. Of course, this music is very speedy, but it starts with very slow movement. So, it doesn't jar you suddenly. I hope you Russians and Ukrainians will buy some of these records and enjoy them. I have not heard your Indian music, but I know about Romania. I have not heard their Indian music in India. But from Romania, these people they sing in Sanskrit language with such beautiful understanding of classical music. And today I was surprised that English have started singing in Sanskrit. It is a very difficult thing!

My father used to tell me, "You should never try to teach Hindi language to English, because it's impossible. Then if you cannot teach Hindi, how can you teach them Sanskrit which is a tongue twister?" But this is the beauty of Sahaja Yoga that everything they have now expressed in a way that they could never have done before. It's amazing the way they sing also Indian songs and Indian tunes, Indian ragas. Without going into any tuition, any study about it, without.

Now these two great artists have dedicated their life to music, and must have worked very hard to achieve this mastery. Of course, I will not say that you try to master the music of India. I will not say that because it's very, very difficult. But what you can do is to appreciate it. Like Me, I don't know how to play anything, you’ve heard. Maybe, harmonium I will play. [Shri Mataji is laughing]
But there should be people who should really appreciate and enjoy it. That is the greatest encouragement to artists.

He just once came to our program. I was amazed at his genius and the great creativity he has. And every time I see him, he again goes so much better than the previous. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

So we have here Yusuf Ali Khan [on tabla], who came through a friend of my husband. They say, "The Bengal is dying with music". In Hindi, they say that, "Bengal, from where he comes, is dying with music, life with music". And they have really great musicians. And I am so very happy that we have somebody from Bengal. That state is very creative, in music, in art, handicrafts, everywhere. The greatest is the novelist, Sharat Chandra. I have not read anybody better than him. Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay

I mean of course Tolstoy was great. I wouldn't say he was not. But the way Sharat Chandra understood human beings was so subtle like a music. I think he was the greatest writer and novelist I could think of. He was also a Realized soul. And in his novels he has described human beings as if they are some beautiful instruments played by the great artist, God. You can understand music but all these great works are to be translated for Sahaja Yogis. I think that they should know there are so many great writers and great novelist, poets all over the world.

In your country also, we had very great writers. And the great thing about them was that they showed, even a hero or a heroine, being introspective. Whatever they did, they used to introspect, "Am I doing it right or not? Is it proper or not?" This is something very unique of Russian writers. Also, the Russian music is also another spiritual experience for Me. In its own pure form, you can enjoy Indian music. In the pure form, you can enjoy Russian music. But it should be pure, coming from the heart not just to show off something. You cannot cheat people. All this hypocritical music will die out. I know that.

So, for Sahaja Yogis, it is important that they should listen to all classical music and music, also folklore is good, which is pure. I never had any chance to talk to you people about music so I have taken this opportunity to say a few words about it.

Music carries vibrations. Without music, we cannot have Sahaja Yoga. But that doesn't mean you just all run after music. You have to have balance.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
So, we have to thank these two great artists who have come all the way to Russia. It was sheer, as if a big palace of joy, they created. They both are also Sahaja Yogis. They have vibrations. And because of that, you see, this rapport is so good, that you understand them and they understand you.

It was a very beautiful night we had with the children playing like that and the God of Innocence, Shri Ganesha, being represented by them. We have presents for you tomorrow, 11 o'clock. I hope you all will be here to receive the present and this time everybody should get. Only Russians and Ukrainian. Others are foreigners.
Thank you very much.
