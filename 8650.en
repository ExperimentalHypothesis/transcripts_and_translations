Gudi Padwa puja, Noida, India, 18 March 1999

Translation from Hindi:

Today is the Day of Gudi Padwa [Maharashtrian New Year]. And it is celebrated in Maharashtra mostly, but now in other places too. It is said that it is a very auspicious day. Whatever work is done on that day it is fruitful. But whatever is the reason is as per worldly beliefs.

The other thing is that, in Shalivahana dynasty, there was one person Babruvahana. He defeated king Vikramaditya. After that he started this new calendar called ‘Shalivahana Calendar’. As per that from today, today is the first day.

Its importance is more in Maharashtra. To represent Shalivahana, they take ‘kumbh’ [round water pot] and in that a shawl – he was Shalivahana. ‘Kumbh’ represents Kundalini. They tie a shawl and keep a ‘kumbh’ on top. The meaning of that is ‘kumbh’ also represents spirituality. Spirituality is represented by the ‘kumbh’.

Shalivahana used to call themselves seven vehicles. They had a lot of faith in Kundalini. Later they started giving shawl to Devi [Goddess]. They were worshipers of Devi so they called themselves – Shalivahana.  That is how the name got changed.

The Shalivahana who were there were from Mewad Dynasty. They were rulers of Mewad of Sisodia Dynasty. Their son, of Sisodia dynasty, for some reason he had a difference with his uncle so he ran away and went to Maharashtra and then to Chennai.

This is how it happened and this is the history of Shalivahanas. Even I belong to Shalivahana. Thousands of years back they had gone to Maharashtra, we are also descendants of the Shalivahan dynasty so our name became ‘Salve’ from ‘Shalu’.

The person Shalu, who had fought a war with Bheeshma, you must’ve heard – Shalu. With Bheeshma it was Shalu. He helped Pandavas later. He had cursed him [Bheeshma]. Bheeshma had made a cage around him. Because of the cage he could not come out. So he cursed Bheeshma that even you will be trapped in a cage – that happened to Bheeshma in the end.

He is also of a great dynasty, but thousands of years old dynasty. It was revived later.  There was a sage there who had a dream of Shivji, Who said, “Make Bappa Rawal the king of this place”. From there the revival of Shalivahan dynasty took place. Don’t know how from ‘Shalu’ it became ‘Shalivahan’. Padmini [queen] was also of the same dynasty.

People of Meerut went there to find out, the people were so true to their word, righteous, worshippers of Devi – they say such type of people are not even there. They were very different people. Everything of theirs was destroyed as they did not compromise. But Jaipur people compromised – first with Muslims then with English, so there, there was prosperity. One should not judge people based on prosperity, it should be based on character.

Today – this day was started by these Shalivahana by Bbabruvahana. So it was made slightly earlier to Christ during the time of Vikramaditya. Even now people of Maharashtra believe a lot in it.

Here it is ‘Vikram Samvat’ [Vikram Year/calendar]. In Maharashtra it is Shalivahana Samvat [Shalivahan Year/calendar]. Even we, probably because I am from Maharashtra, we follow Shalivahan calendar. As per that today is a significant day and whatever you desire will be fulfilled.

Many blessings to all.
