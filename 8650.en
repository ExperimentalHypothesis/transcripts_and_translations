…The goal that is yours… and the goal that is yours is the fulfillment of your being, to become the Spirit. It’s very, very subtle to understand. You think you are doing nothing wrong what’s that, after all, (why am doing somewhere..inaudible)???  wrong or something serious, the body should react. But no nothing will react neither your mind nor your body.
You see, all these years, my experience has been very simple, that there are some Sahaja Yogis still involved in the Lakshmi principle. Like, they want to cheat me, they want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga. Then there are some people who want to do business among us. All of them have failed very badly, failed so badly, that they are like bankrupts, or they are in jail and all kinds of things. So never do business with a Sahaja Yogi. For a Sahaja Yogi it is very important not to do any business with the Sahaja Yogis. If you understand this same principle you’ll not do business with Sahaja Yoga. Of course, you can’t do business with me also. So, this is a very, very simple thing in which people start doing. For example, they meet 2 Sahaja Yogis, one from- say from Japan, and another from, say- America. And they start saying: Oh, you are a Sahaja Yogi, I’m also Sahaja Yogi, can you give me some false paper or you can give me some report”, they go on asking you questions. “Baba, we don’t want, we don’t want to do that.” They are not interested in …they are interested in what you have and this is something one has to learn, very cleverly and intelligently, when people start communicating to you, about the business part. In Sahaja Yoga there is no business among themselves except they have business with Self Realization.
If you understand this point, small, the money part of it  which is quite illusive will disappear. It all works out beautifully if you are surrendered, but otherwise also, it can be worked out even if you are not surrendered, because you see the result, and you are hurt, you are troubled, and so you give it up.
So whatever happens, it’s our watching system I should say, one of the chakras here, you can see clearly, you are watching, clearly you see how much you have gone into trouble, so you give it up. But, before doing that, we have a very good way of seeing through our vibrations. You just feel the vibrations and see for yourself if the vibrations are good or not. If they are not alright, then you should know that there is something wrong. You can judge any human being you like, You can judge any pastor or you want to see any – one of these millionaires and all those things – but first you must find out, that one, is he a perfect Sahaja Yogi or not? This happens within individuals, it can happen in the collective also.
I’ve seen in the collective people are so much mislead, and one negative person immediately knows who is the other negative and then he gets hold of that negative, and they start working together. So you have to be extremely cautious, that you have got your Realization, you’ve got everything, you’ve got also a lot of money in Sahaja Yoga. With all that, you should know, it’s a very, very good sign for thieves to walk in. So you should be very careful and don’t get charmed by all these nonsensical things. That’s what is the protection from your Mother, that She wants to protect you in this way. Our whole attitude towards life has to be that of a witness, you see everything clearly. Gradually, this seeing will become so very sharp, so clever, so understanding, that you’ll be amazed. Then you’ll be using something… [??] anything else, then you don’t have to think, only you have to know the vibrations, what are the vibrations are, what do the vibrations say, because they are there to guide you.

Those who are nor yet very good at vibrations should try to establish themselves. If you are not good at vibrations that means you’ll not judge people rightly, nor will have knowledge, problem. So first you must get your, all your vibrations corrected and also chakras corrected. After that you can see what are your associates, who are they. See actually, your mind now is so enlightened that you can straight forward see everything before you.

But if you don’t use that enlightened mind, you’ll be amazed there are some forces of negativity and once these [??] forces start- see actually, I should say we are at a juncture now that these things won’t happen anymore but [Shri Mataji laughs] when I started Sahaja Yoga it was very bad, very bad situation, and we had half-baked, quarter-baked, one sixteen-baked [general laughs] people. And I just did not know how to tell them because, if I tell them anything, they would just run away, they would not come to sahaj yoga. While in the other places like guru’s, what they do, they take money and “bas” [Hindi word meaning “finished”] that’s all. Now people think now we have given money to the guru, how can we leave and they go on giving money and stick around. But in Sahaja Yoga there is no money involved, so they come then they disappear. Very common; it’s very, very common that they come for a short time to Sahaj Yog, but if they are really special people, they just stick and start seeing everything from the right angle, because they are enlightened, they’ve grown up, they’re mature.

So this is how we have to come back, this horrible night of Kali Yuga through Diwali. This is what we have to do, to be humble and to find whether you are all right or not, whether you are going in the right direction or not. It is you only who can do this, with vibrations you can immediately know that you are catching, or you will know you are right. Whatever decision has to be taken, you have to use your hands fully. It’s not talking that is going to help. It’s not giving lectures that is going to help, no.

It’s through experimenting, through understanding through the feeling or the deep-I should say- the deep impact of everything that will communicate to you what sort of a people they are, what they are talking about, what you should do. This could be little mental, but later on it becomes absolutely beyond the mental activity.

Now, as it is, I said that Kali Yuga is over, is about to finish. But still, there may be people who would like to go back to this kind of normalcy – so called. But there is a way out for all this, is simple meditation. With meditation, you can achieve whatever is to be achieved. And then you’ll be surprised that we have a very, very, very important thing to know and the most important thing is to be watchful about yourself, that I hope you are not falling into the trap of Lakshmi. The same Lakshmi that decorates you, can also disfigure you.
So we have to do everything to keep this beautiful Lakshmi, this decorated Lakshmi as our ideal and it works out.

Our aim is this, our ideal is this and we have to do this so we can establish the new government, very beautiful government, our all attitude should be such that we have to be alert, because you become meditative. As soon as you start thinking about something you’ll become meditative. The thinking will go away. You wont be able to think. And then you can be lost. But no. When you are meditative then you cannot be lost. Why? Because then you have given your life in the hands of Truth. You have given your hand into the hand of Reality, and that guides you that protects you along and they watch you-that watches you, that helps you, you can never go wrong, even if you are meditative, don’t you worry nothing will happen. But if you are never meditative, then it’s impossible to say. It’s impossible to say, it’s impossible to mature, you have to be very meditative to mature. That’s very important. I would say that all the Sahaja Yogis here, today, are doing this puja and then there will be also another puja of enlightenment I have been called or whatever it is – but you have to be very, very careful not to renounce your meditating, no. What you can do is to watch how far you have gone, how far you have solved your problems. As soon as you see that, immediately, you become a complete Realized soul.

So the guideline is such that we should know that we are Realized souls. And what is so important? Why are we, have Realized souls? Not only for our desires, for our pure desire, but also for others. And in that understanding, that we are not only for ourselves but for others you become collectively conscious. And you stand with others. You stand very well. Otherwise, you are lost and others are also lost. This way is the way we have to really go ahead, go ahead towards the Truth and bring that truth for other people and save them. This is how you can express your love to them all your caring.

This subject, which is very difficult to handle I think, because of – [Shri Mataji laughs] I should say that to talk about this subject is much easier than to assimilate this within ourselves. So now when you are listening to me please try, that we have to meditate afterwards. In meditation you will assimilate and the same power that you think is within you, of discrimination, of giving vibrations, of doing all kinds of things out of Sahaja Yoga will be completely, continuously be active. [Shri Mataji claps in Her hands?] But if you do not meditate, if you are somewhere else, it can’t work out, won’t work out.

So today is the day to celebrate and to be happy that we have so many Sahaja Yogis all over, there is hope for the whole world, and we can save all the people who are lost in the wilderness. That’s a fact no doubts. But after that celebration and everything, we should sit on the – we can call- on the asana anywhere and watch what is happening, and you’ll be amazed that in the meditation, you will be revealed with all the beauties you have achieved, all kinds of things that you have achieved. And all the worries and botheration of things disappear. This should happen to you all. And this is what I request to all: to have this special capacity to understand yourself.
My own hope is fulfilled. To see you sitting down here, I feel overjoyed. And same way, you will also feel, when you all will try to raise the Kundalini of others, establish them in Sahaja Yoga, to be amazed to what will happen to you. It’s so joyous to give Realization to others. For that, you don’t have to do anything, you don’t have to pay anything, nothing of the kind, this power you have, which is awakened that’s all. What you have to do, where ever you go you just have to awaken the Kundalini of the person, give Realization. Nothing else to be done. And that’s so joy giving, I feel so happy about it. So today, I bless you all with this special power that you give Realization to people and look after the Nabhi of the people and whatever it is. It’s very, very important to understand how far you can go. We have to change the world, we have to save the world, it’s your responsibility. You have got Realization, not the others. So don’t try to find faults with others, think about you. You have Realization and it is expected that you should spread Sahaja yoga.
Thank you very much.
May God bless you.
