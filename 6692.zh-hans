你是神圣存有的一部分

1980年12月1日 英国伦敦卡克斯顿大厅

我的房子容纳不下你们所有人,因此我想最好来这儿,这里适合所有人。今天是留给我们霎哈嘉瑜伽士的最后一天(母亲去印度的旅程前)。

我们必须了解关于我们自己和我们组织的一些非常非常重要的事情,那就是神圣。

现在,我可以告诉你们,从整体上,而不是从个体的问题或事情上,因为你们现在不再是个体。你们都变成了神圣存有的一部分,你们都是觉醒的细胞,因此在整体的层面上,我们必须理解为此我们要做些什么。

首要的,我们必须要知道我们是得自觉的灵,你们得到了自觉,你们是圣人,你们拥有圣人所能具有的所有力量。没有一位圣人比你们拥有更多的力量,事实上,这一切正在显现之中。没有圣人拥有你们今天所拥有的知识。

你们将会感到惊讶:迄今为止没有一本书能讲述你们内在的灵性存有,通过霎哈嘉瑜伽,你们才开始认识这个部分。你们必须接受这个事实,事实就是如此。那些圣人中的任何一位,不管谁写了多少书——即使是商揭罗,他也不能解释像你们所知道的这么多的事情。然而商揭罗的素质是极高的——或者说他这类型的人,如摩根迪亚,或者佛陀。他们的素质是极高的,因为他们是极之纯洁的人们——纯净。他们在非常高的程度上得到了个人救赎。然而你们更好地达到了集体的救赎。但就个体来讲,他们的素质极高。他们对神圣的力量没有疑惑,他们对神毫无疑惑。他们从没有任何疑惑,他们非常尊贵。他们从不为生活的琐事而烦恼。对他们而言,去思考这些事情太微不足道了。任何琐碎之事,我们在上面花费太多时间。我知道我们得处理它,因为毕竟我们是人类,我们带着人类的意识来到了霎哈嘉瑜伽,然后我们得到了自觉。因此,你们净化的时间非常非常短暂。而他们有如此多的时间来净化自己。

现在,举个例子,摩西是降世神祇,具有非常纯净的品格,或者,耶稣是降世神祇,绝对纯净的化身。但是祂们是我们的典范,而我们要做的是从人类变成先知。

因此你们对这两方面(灵性&人性)都很了解,人类的弱点是什么,他们有什么问题,他们如何逃离实相,他们如何受到迷惑。但是,我们仍然没有好好使用我们应该使用的生命能量的力量。这点就是我想告诉你们的——你们都有生命能量的力量。当我们开始使用生命能量的力量时,我们也不知道,为了应用这力量,我们应该抱有什么样的尊严和礼仪。这是我们内在神祇的力量,这是一种仪式,通过它,我们让神祇的力量在我们内在运作。

就如你们所知道的,古时候的人们通过这种力量创造了许多奇迹,但是他们是非常有尊严的人,他们的性格中没有轻浮,他们的内在没有无用的,或完全没有灵性价值的问题存在。当你使用你的生命能量的觉知时,你不应该将它们用在无用的事上,比如,去电影院有交通堵塞,然后你觉得这有交通问题,所以你必须用你生命能量的力量来到达那地方。这是轻佻的,它根本不重要。在霎哈嘉瑜伽中,你是否去到电影院无关紧要。紧要的是:什么是你灵性的力量,你在你的灵性上走了多远。电影院一点也不重要。你是圣人,你内在所能达到的圣洁程度才是主要的问题。否则,你其他的所有事情都是没意义的。或者说所有这些问题在灵性中都是毫无意义的。

因此,所有的霎哈嘉瑜伽士必须认识到,你们现在是新生儿,你们有新的觉知,你们必须拥有那种尊严。

我举个例子,因为今天我刚好在跟人讨论这个。当你给某人班丹时,你只是像这样或那样转动你的手,不应该这样做。你们的手本身就要受到尊重,因为这是一位圣人的手。所有的神祇都居住在你的手上和手指上,因此,当你必须给班丹或任何事时,你必须恰当地使用手和手指,以一种有尊严的方式去使用它们。应该绝对避免任何侮辱或低俗的行为方式。

然后关于对待彼此,你们必须知道:你们现在都在神圣力量的流通中。你们必须互相尊重,相亲相爱。你们必须互相尊重,因为你们都是圣人。每位圣人都必须尊重其他圣人,这是最低限度。如果你们不互相尊重,你们的轮穴将会失调,尤其是喉轮,因为这是集体的联系。同样母亲的轮穴也会失调,因为你们的安全感就是你们的集体性。彼此之间的爱不仅要得到照顾,而且要得到滋养,受到崇拜,这应该是一种美德。你们对待彼此不应该像普通人一样。不要!这是一种很珍贵的关系。即使在对任何一位非常亲密的人谈话时——比如你兄弟,姐妹,丈夫,妻子——你都必须要尊重,你必须要尊重,要不然,就毫无意义。

当你们的父母成为霎哈嘉瑜伽士,你们必须比以前更加尊重他们,因为他们是圣人,也是你们的父母。首先,相互尊重是彼此关系的基调。没有爱意的尊重则没有意义。彼此尊重,还要相亲相爱。一个人在生活中地位高低,在霎哈嘉瑜伽中,都无关紧要。你们挣了多少钱,你们在生活中地位如何,你们住在哪儿都不重要。重要的是我们是一体的,我们是那些已成为先知的人,我们是那些得到力量能够提升他人昆达里尼的人,这样的一种力量进入我们,是因为我们的母亲非常爱我们,因此我们的义务是彼此相爱。

我是如何尊重你的?其实我不需要如此,因为你知道在你我之间有一个巨大的鸿沟。但是我仍然尊重你们,因为你是圣人。任何圣人不受尊重的地方,那个国家就会堕落。

因此,首先你们必须学会如何互相尊重。这是我们应该进行的非常非常重要的训练。不管他是你的丈夫还是妻子,不管他是你的兄弟还是姐妹,父亲,母亲,或者孩子,因为他是一位圣人——请尊重他!

但我不知道你们会对此如何反应,马上地,你开始想及那些不尊重你的人。想到有多少人你没有尊重。这是典型的自我导向的反应,我们马上开始思考,“噢,那个人不尊重我了!那个男的不尊重我!”但只是想想有多少人你没有尊重。

当我不在这儿时,其实我在这儿的时间更多。我还没去过澳大利亚,但你们知道那里的人有多了不起——那么纯洁,那么善良,那么出色。但是这里,这种情况并不多见,因此我必须在这里工作,真的很辛苦。这并不是说英国有那么糟糕。但是一直有种感受,“母亲在这里,我们将把我们所有的问题留给她,然后她能够解决。”你们带给我多是鸡毛蒜皮的事——这无所谓——但是现在你们有能力去解决你们的问题,也有能力去解决他人的问题。

除非是一些根本的事,否则你们没必要麻烦我,也不需要问我。你们可以去做。但是你们必须从霎哈嘉瑜伽的角度来思考每样事——你们为霎哈嘉瑜伽做了多少?你们为霎哈嘉瑜伽成就了多少?这才是如今的霎哈嘉瑜伽士聚在一起(所要做的事情)。

我们必须要从根本上理解一件事:那就是我们必须要成长,我们得让别人和我们一起成长。他人的成长并非通过抑制我们的成长来实现,而是与我们共同成长。

只有当你让其他人与你一起成长时,你才会成长。否则,就不会真正地成长。现在,不管我说什么,都会写进书里,有时候能进入人们的脑子里——它应进入人们的心里

整个霎哈嘉瑜伽系统都是在心灵的层面上工作:那里即是灵。灵才是我所谈论的。灵由此而感到喜乐。

我听说,有一些人像使用武器一样使用他们的双手。这是非常危险的。你们不应为了你自己而做这一切。你们只是圣人,还不是神。所以不要尝试这类事情。有一些人有像这样用手打人的习惯。当我在场,要你这样做的时候,是没问题的。但除此之外,你不应该这样做。

你必须要(学会)尊重。使用所有温柔温和的方法,不要对圣人做任何不敬之事。当然,我知道你在打击另外一个人身上的负面能量。但是你没必要那样做(打人),或去抛弃任何人,或排挤某人做某事。你会下降得非常厉害。这是一件你们必须要明白的,非常严肃的事情。你拥有所有的力量,知道自己能去到多远,因此你必须要保持份际。不要越界,因为这类事情给你自我,而自我是我们一直面对的非常危险的东西。尽力去改善你的语言表达,尽量和善,彼此要非常和善。

我希望下次再来的时候你们会有更多的人。我对你们寄予厚望。我不知道是否应当如此,但我给予你们的东西如此美妙、如此宏大,这是令人难以置信的。无疑,我希望你们能做到,因为你们是被特别拣选的。我与你们一起工作了许多年。你们有英语录音带。法国人,可怜的家伙,他们没有法语录音带,录音带必须被翻译。他们没有法语的书,他们很难理解我(所说过的话)。然而他们是多么专注、多么深入。他们每一个人都说,“母亲,我是如此爱您,我爱您。”“我有很多缺点,但我把自己奉献给您,您能接受我吗?”他们所有人都这样说。只是想象一下!我很惊讶他们对我说这些事情的方式,以及他们理解自己内在缺陷的方式。

现在,我们必须改变我们对待金钱、物质、情感、身体和所有这些事情的行为方式。比如说,一个人结婚了——婚姻应当是成功的。如果你的婚姻不成功,也不幸福,你就不会受到祝福,一点都不会。尝试让你的婚姻非常幸福和成功。这是非常重要的。婚姻是由太初之母所建立的体制。你们不能令它蒙羞。不要草率地对待你们的婚姻。

然后你们必须允许孩子出生,这样你们便能使伟大的灵降生在这地球上,如此我们给予他们一个机会,一个非常好的机会,来过非常幸福的生活。但是,如果夫妻之间不开心,那么即使自觉的灵出生了,他们也会给你们添麻烦,他们不能很好地成长,他们会有问题。

因此,首要的,(你们要)创造一个幸福喜乐的家庭。有些人认为,如果他们远离霎哈嘉瑜伽士,他们将会过上幸福美满的婚姻生活。这是绝对错误的,完全错误。如果你不能在灵舍中创造一个美满的婚姻生活,你在任何其他地方也都不能。首先在灵舍中尝试,值得一试。否则,你们不能成就它。因为这样你就会明白如何与他人分享你的生活和你的婚姻生活。

任何物质上的东西,比如买了一个房子或买了这个东西、那个东西,都不那么重要。你内在的房屋、你心的圣殿应该是洁净的。我们在这世上不是为了建造房屋,不是为了挣钱攒钱。我们在此是要建立内在的圣殿,生生不息的真正的圣殿,它充满生机,是我们内在的活生生的神所安住之处。因此,这些物质性的东西在一定程度上是重要的,但不要超过那个度。最重要的,不是你如何得到霎哈嘉瑜伽的验证,而是霎哈嘉瑜伽通过你得到了多少证明。

很多人认为,“我们应该得到一个好房子,因为我们来到了玛塔吉这里了。”是的,你确实得到了。你得到了好工作。没错。你得到了它。你的财政状况得到了改善。没错。每件事情都在你身上发生了。但是你给了霎哈嘉瑜伽多少?以这样的方式,对于霎哈嘉瑜伽你证实了多少?

人们有时候认为,如果他们捐款就足够了——这不够。用你的心、你的爱、你的友谊、你们彼此间甜蜜的理解、以最纯洁的形式享受彼此间的陪伴来丰富它,不带有任何目的,不像某个自我倾向或性倾向的人得到的那些低级的享乐或者低级的快乐。而是纯洁的喜乐,纯粹的喜乐。纯洁是我们必须要面对的主题。我们必须试着更纯洁一些、更纯洁一些。然后那纯洁会灿烂地闪耀在你们的脸上、体现在你们的行为中、彰显在你们将成为的整体存有中。

你的存在本身就会显示出你是一名霎哈嘉瑜伽士。你不需要去证明。你不需要去穿着某些特别的衣着来表现,但是人们会从你的脸上和行为中就知道你是圣人。你得站在队伍的最后。你应该是那种旁观事情的人:你不应该去争第一个,也不需要抢先排到队伍最前面,不!你是在最后的,因为你与你自己在一起。他们不是,他们没有得到自己的安全感,所以尝试在这些事物中寻找它。而你们有自己的安全感。

基于灵,来改变你们所有的优先次序,然后喜乐就变成你们自己的了。我真的期待你们能做出美妙的事情来,我希望你们都能一起努力,创造出美妙的东西。我不知道如何来单独讲述这些事情,但事实上,我已经在巴黎和这些霎哈嘉瑜伽士讲过了,我告诉他们,霎哈嘉瑜伽会有非常迅速的发展,而且极为迅速。这么快的迅速以至于如果你跟不上霎哈嘉瑜伽的速度,那么你将会被抛弃。你必须保持霎哈嘉瑜伽的速度。那些不能通过某种方式来保持此速度的,或那些被某些事情或某些错误的认同所禁锢的人,将会掉队。

只有保持与霎哈嘉瑜伽的速度同步,你们才能够成长。霎哈嘉瑜在印度的发展将会是非常惊人的。我知道这五年在澳大利亚,也将会是极好的。英国的话也有可能,这取决于你们这些人的速度。霎哈嘉瑜伽将会飞速前进,你们必须理解——要放下你们所有的枷锁,放下所有错误的认同,所有荒谬的狂热或所有诸如你是英国人,这啊那的一些错误的认同。只是成为霎哈嘉瑜伽士,成为宇宙的存有。这是非常重要的。时代已经来临。明年将要开始。

我祝福你们新年快乐,有一个非常非常幸福和愉悦的圣诞节!

愿神祝福你们!

Now we have to await for other people who will be coming now but [if] any Sahaja Yogis have any problems or any questions should ask now till other programme will start.

Can you have some chair nearby to talk to them? I think a simple one will do, it’s too elaborate to more. Douglas wants to move the whole big thing? Just an ordinary chair, Douglas, is alright for me.

He wants to move the big one.

Ask me questions, very important, on to small, small things. Later on, “Mother said so,” or, “Mother said so,” should not be there. Sahaja Yogis should ask because new people who have come, who have not got yet Realisation should wait for a while because I am just dealing with the Sahaja Yogis. And then we'll start our programme  after just, say, ten minutes. Is it all right for new people?

Just put it (the chair) here.

Douglas Fry: Should we bring it further forward?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. I am alright. Just bring it nearer here.

Now, I want Sahaja Yogis to ask me questions. It is important. Sahaja yogis should ask me questions. Please. You have to do everything with consultation with each other. No group should be formed separately.

Ask me questions. Come along! What's the matter?

Don. You’re getting thoughtless. Then, “Mother said like this,” and “Mother says like this,” and “Mother has told..” - this should be stopped. You see, actually we think outside going, outside doing is the way. No! Inside! Grow inside.

Certain things I am going to write it down so that there's no confusion about things but, till I come back, the ashram system should go as it is today. Then when I come back we'll change it. But just now it's all right as it is. Nobody should take new steps. If you get a house or something, all right, you take a house. But better thing is to stick on to ashram for the time being, look after it and substantiate. I mean [if] somebody is allotting you a house, it’s all right. But you need not take a house on rent or something to get out of ashram. That's the escape.

Ray Harris: I often find that it’s better to - after telling them the basics of Sahaja Yoga - to wait for them to tell you. And in what they say and their vibrations, what is it that they want to know, rather than really telling them everything.

Shri Mataji: No, no. You should be very discreet. As I have told you in one of My lectures that there are three groups of Sahaja Yogis. One are the people who are in the inner circle. Most of you are here. You need not tell them many things. Everything need not be told. That is being not dishonest but that you are discreet. I mean, you need not tell everything. That's a wrong thing. Discretion is to be used. Then the second type are the people who are Sahaja Yogis but yet not there. Still [who] are doubting and still are not so developed. Their Kundalini is not up there. They are still [a] funny type. These are the people you have to be careful about. You need not tell them everything because they can't bear the Truth. They are not yet ready. Unless and until the Kundalini has reached a certain stage they cannot bear it. The sooner you start doing that, the worse they will become. Their doubts will be more because this is too much for them to bear. So you have to wait, wait and see for yourself. That should not be done. Just talk about Sahaja Yoga, direct. You need not talk about me. Now how will they understand me? I mean, you cannot understand me, how can they understand?

The other day somebody asked me that, “Kundalini rises with such difficulties, and they had to purify yourself and all that, and here how my Kundalini has risen like this. Mother? How could it be?” I said, “It has risen or not?” He said, “Yes.” “You feel it?” “Yes, yes, I have. It is risen.” Then I said, “There must be something with me. All right?” He said, “That's what I was wondering that must be something about Mother. How is it that She's done it?” I said, "There is something. All right. So just now you need not find out. Just now you find out about yourself. Let it grow. Because I do not want to shock you. There is something about me, no doubt.”

And one of them was saying that, “It's such a miraculous thing that my sinus has gone, I am feeling so much better. My drugs I have given up. I'm so much better and so fantastic that I can't believe it. How can it be? I tried all kinds of medicines, I went to the hospital, I did this, I did that, I had an operation. Nothing worked out. And how is it this simple thing like Sahaja Yoga has worked out?” I said, “It is too simple but it is to the point. It's so precise. It acts. It is something that acts.” “But how is it?” I said, “It does!” Like we were going to Paris. They announced that the temperature of Paris is zero degrees. So, Christine was sitting next to me rather worried. I said, “Don't you worry! It is going to improve.” Within fifteen days they said, “Suddenly the temperature has gone up five degrees!” Today London's temperature has gone up after my coming here. It works but they are surprised how it is working.

After all, all these things are promised. The time has come. But you need not tell them! No, don't shock. It's correct, Ray, what you say. It’s very discreet. Ray is a very discreet person. No doubt about it. He has tremendous discretion. And that's what you should use: What to say to anyone and how far to say. It’s a very discreet method. And you must know how to compromise also. You should not be something like a cynic. You must learn to compromise. You must learn to compromise. And understand [that] they are people who are not yet Realised. You are Realised, you are grown into it, you are much more matured. So you have to be much more gentle with them and not to show off to them [that] they feel small. Like somebody is asking a question, maybe stupid, may be, possibly. Doesn't matter, he's not Realised. And if you laugh at him sarcastically or make fun of him, naturally you lose him. You are not to lose these people. You have to get them in, and that is their right, they are seekers. They are seekers. We have to really understand this with great compassion and love for them. They are seekers. We have to work it on them, not to just laugh at them or make fun of them or in any way to put them down. On the contrary, show them due respect because they are seekers as you were. Before that what we were? What sort of people we were? How many arguments we have had with Mother? How stupid we have been? We just forget all that and suddenly we become very wise. No! Wisdom lies in understanding that they have to have their enlightenment. They haven't got it as yet. They have to grow in that light. This is the problem.

Now you have to use your discretion. There's no need to ask me. I will know from your mistakes, where you have done mistakes. But consult each other, consult each other. Talk to each other absolutely freely. There's nothing to be hidden amongst Sahaja Yogis. Nothing to be hidden among Sahaja Yogis. But with elders, with other people, be respectful. Maybe you being young are more active in Sahaja Yoga. Maybe children are still not so developed in it. We have to take all of them together, not to be unkind by any kind of sarcasm because I have told you a hundred times and hundred and eight times now: sarcasm has no place in Sahaja Yoga. This is no way of joking! It's a very sly method. Nobody should beat also, in the same way. It's just the same, other side of the coin. Beating or shouting or putting up your head like this on other people, like this. Many people have a habit of putting their heads like this when they talk to others. Or French people have a very bad habit of putting their face like this. I was surprised. Anybody you talk to ... means nothing goes into his head. I said, “What's happening here?” Is he like a duck? And you say anything, again they will say another thing. I mean, everything has a tail coming out. So is that these are our tails? We should understand that. We should not put up ourselves to such barriers but accept things as they are. And those who have, who come to you, don't get angry with them because by talking or argument you are not going to convince them but by only by Sahaja Yoga. Try to give them Realisation. Do not argue!

Some people think, “If you talk to them sweetly, if you are sympathetic.” No! Also that doesn't work out. You go on wasting your time with them, and they'll go away. They’ll not be there. Where is their Kundalini? How far is it rising? That's the point you should see. Instead of just trying to be very nice to them, then discussion, then this. No use! Waste of time. In the same way if you are angry with that person and argue; it's also wrong. Both are a waste of time. But be gentle and kind and see where is the Kundalini.

Best is to use photographs. And please do not start curing people. Otherwise, I'll find all the sick patients in Sahaja Yoga. They are not to cure. It's finished now. Better not do it. What's the use of curing these people? They are so ungrateful. They have no sense at all and they don't want to do Sahaja Yoga. We are not interested in such useless people. Those who come to Sahaja Yoga will improve in their health automatically. You don't have to give them any treatment. They can work it out on the photograph, that’s all. That's the end of it.

Sit down!

Now, what any other? Maureen? Mark [Rossi], ask some sensible questions. You are good. They have been a very good husband and wife, I must say. Very happy with them. They are a good, ideal couple and I hope they keep it up.

Also there are some people I know who are very much interested in getting everyone married. Now stop it! Till I come back you don't have all these things. Otherwise the mind, it becomes a marriage bureau. Some people have a specialty about it. Instead of loving others' children, also create your own children.

Some people like to play with others' children. It's also not good. Better have your own children. That doesn't mean you just love your own children. But that's how they get that thing satisfied and they don't want to have children and then who's going to bear the children who want to come on this earth? That's a big responsibility.

What else? Ask one or two questions. Gavin, please ask some questions. It's two minutes more.

Gavin Brown: How do we prevent Sahaja Yoga from becoming a cult?

Shri Mataji: What is it?

Gavin Brown: How do we prevent Sahaja Yoga from becoming a cult?

Shri Mataji: Yes, it's possible. Because, you see, you think, “I'm catching. I'm catching.” This madness has come also in Sahaja Yogis. This will become really cultish stuff! It will really become a cult. Nonsense! What are you catching? You are pure vibrations. You give Realisation to anyone - none of your chakras catch anybody else. Everybody thinks, “I'm pure,” - what it is they say?  Holier than holy! What is catching? What? All such dainty darlings are no good. “I am catching. I ! You have to be brave warriors. What is catching? “I don't want to give vibrations with this catching. I don't want to do it.” All right, use the photograph to begin with. But if you have to do it, you should not be frightened. You are swords!

It is true, Gavin, what you said. It's very true. But you look after that part - that none of them should become that, “I am catching this and I am catching that.” And “I don't like this and I don't like Sahaja Yogis doing this.” This is all wrong. This will make a big cult out of it. Of course, that's not possible. You try such tricks and you will know what it means! That won't be possible though. But be careful; you will go out of gear. Nobody has to form a cult. Everybody who is coming to Sahaja Yoga has to be absolutely with both the arms stretched out, “Come along!” Just like your Mother. I should be the greatest cult myself. Why should I bother about anybody else?

This catching business should drop out from your mouth. Everybody comes and says, “I caught it from him.” “I caught up from them.” I am amazed! How can you catch up from anyone? What are you? A dainty darling or what? Now no more it is going to be tolerated! “I caught up from that.” Go and beat yourself with shoes. If you are such a dainty darling that’s what you deserve! You know how to do it! (laughing)

Nobody should say, “I am catching.” Also neglect these things completely. The more your attention you pay them, the more they will sit on your head. Just neglect and go ahead.

What Paul has pointed out is true. This is very common in England, not in India. Nobody says that, nobody. I've not heard one person saying, “I am catching from that person.” Never! They say, “This is my weakness so I must have felt for that.” They never say like that. This is [your] speciality - putting the blame on others. This is typical ego style business. Put the blame on others! As if you are pure and you have caught up from another. It's your weakness. That's all what you should think about.

You are brave people. You have to be very, very brave. Without bravery how are we going to do Sahaja Yoga? Just tell me. You have to love with bravery. In love you don't think and consider and all these things - you just go ahead. Such a powerful thing to love someone.

That “Such person should not be there and such person should not do that" - nothing! Now those people who come for the first time, or are not so much - they may not have proper protocol - that doesn't mean that you get after their heads. Otherwise, it will become a cult.

The first thing is consideration of others! And understanding that they are not Realised, they are not enlightened. This is very important. You must understand this. They are not enlightened as yet. They have not got their vibrations. They haven't got their vibratory awareness. To get angry with them is wrong, absolutely wrong.

What else now? That's a good point. One more point you can ask me because some people are coming.

Also do not allow your weaknesses to sit on your heads. For example, some people have a habit of telling me, “Mother I had this, I was this, I went there and still that is lingering into me.” Then you are absolutely useless! Why don't you take it out? Finish off. Like that. “Still I have been to this yogi, I've been to that yogi. I have done this, I have done that.” It’s done! Finished! In the present time you are pure Spirit. Become that.

What is there to be proud of these nonsensical things? They are no parallel to Spirit. When the Spirit shines the darkness has to go away.

If there is still darkness that means something wrong with you, and if you are wrong, then what are you boasting about? I mean, people have a habit of boasting! Try to be alert and loving; loving and alert. You have to be really alert.

What else?

Yogini: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: It's a little personal question, isn't it? I'll tell you separately, all right? Because this is not the problem of many, all right? General problems should be solved. This is very personal. It's pertaining to you.

What else?

Man: If I follow you, do I have to give up friends who...?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, not at all. Why should you? On the contrary you’ll want all your friends to come and join us. You don't follow me; you follow your Self only.

It's a question of not giving up but your priorities change because your awareness changes. Like I could say that if you take a horse through the streets of Paris, he would not notice anything. For him any dirty place, filthy place, is the same as the any street. If you take a man or a woman, she will notice prostitutes standing on the street. He may be repelled towards them, may not be repelled also, possibly. Mostly he would not be repelled. But if you take a saint or a Sahaja Yogi, he'll have compassion for a prostitute but he will know that she has to learn herself. And he won't go near her. When she will come to him, he can pardon her and look after her. But there is no involvement in her, in no way.

So the awareness changes. You start giving up things which are not spontaneous, which are not living, which are dead. You start living a living life. It automatically works out. You don't give-up. On the contrary you get new friends, lots of. They are all your friends and brothers once you get it. Because the language changes, the style changes. You have the light; they are dark and black. They are still in darkness. So they are fumbling, while you see the things straight. You can help them. But if they are fumbling and trying pull you down, you will say, “No, I can't come that way. Now I'm changed.” You are changed, and they are not yet changed - that's the point.

It's transformation, actual, that happens within us. You don't have to give up, not at all. On the contrary, you must meet other people, you must talk to other people. But, for example, if you have other friends who are anti-God, you won't be able to tolerate their company and they won't be friends anymore. I will think, “They are not my friends. They are anti-God. They are anti-love.” You would not like to waste your time with them, having a whisky party or something. You would not like. What a waste! You would not like. But you may be with them but you may not like.

Many people do like that, I have seen. Many people even after coming to Sahaja Yoga try to spend their time with other people. Some of them do it because they have to do it. I know, I have a double life myself. But My life is such that wherever I am, I am with myself. But Sahaja Yogis try to change, I have seen. They spend more time with Sahaja Yogis than with other people like brothers, sisters, cousins. They start changing that. Either the brothers, sisters, cousins try taking more interest in Sahaja Yoga, or they don't enjoy their company. It's just they may go just to visit or to see someone but they don't like their company, they don't enjoy their company so much. It happens like that, because you are enlightened people. Like drunkards: they don't like non-drinking people. And non-drinking people don't like drunkards. If you go with the drunkards, you are frightened.  And mad people like mad people. It's like that.

So then the company changes. And if you don't change, you really don't enjoy Sahaja Yoga really into its fullest extent. But there's no cult as such. You are saintly people. You are saints. So saints talk in different language. Yes, they are much more congenial and happy with the saints. But they would like to meet people and talk to them and try to bring them, because we have to bring such a lot of people to Sahaja Yoga. But you should not waste your energies with people who do not matter in God's work. You don't feel like. I mean, I don't say that “You don’t!”If you have to go to see somebody, I don't say, “You don’t!” But it happens with some people. And such people can go down because they have influences on these people, and it happens like that. Your priorities change. You only then start enjoying whatever is God's style. You don't like something which is anti-God. Like I don't say, “Don't drink!” I don't say Ten Commandments, nothing. But it happens to you.

There were so many people who were drug addicts who came to Sahaja Yoga. They gave up drugs. Now, how can they be with people who are taking drugs? So they started going to them and talking to them and they said, “We have given up drugs.” All right? There's somebody in Paris whose husband is drinking such a lot, and he is still a drug addict, and she is a Sahaja Yogini. But he comes to My programme, and I told that she should be very kind to him and gentle because he wants to give up. But a person who is dragging her, “You must also take a drug!” Then you don't like that aggression. I mean, you should be allowed to be non-smoking also, if you don't want to smoke. But they don't allow! For them it is difficult. They'll force you, “You must drink. You must smoke!” I mean, you must be knowing this that, if you go to any party, and if you don't drink, they think you are mad! And they'll go on asking, “Why don't you drink? At least take this, at least take this.” If you tell them even once, “Why do you drink?” “Oh, you don't drink?” - finished. Then you are the most anti-social person, you have no manners, nothing. I mean you are telling something nice but they'll go on forcing on you. You have to go on telling them that, “Oh, we don't drink. I don't drink. I don't like it. The Doctor has told me.” All sorts of lies you tell them but they'll go on forcing you. But even if you say once that, “Why do you drink?” or “Please don't drink.” - finished. You are the worst person in the whole world. This is such an aggression! Such an aggression. It's a very subtle aggression of these people who are licentious.

It's funny sometimes, I tell you. Like we went to a party, and at that party there was a funny couple came in - that was a woman who was a keep and this and that, and it was a party of married women and married men. And the way the woman was on with everyone, I mean, nobody liked it, neither the women nor the men. And we didn't like that the man - why should he bring his keep there because it was not a party of keeps? But it's aggression. And she was so aggressive! She was saying, “What's the use of being married to a man after all?” She was just saying all kinds of things against us, those who were married women. “There's no use marrying men. I am very happy. I am a keep. He looks after me better. You better give up your husband and live as a keep with them.” She was just giving us a lecture on her status! And we could not say anything to her. But if we say that it's nice to be a married woman and to be virtuous, “Oh, they are the worst women. You are victorian! You are  old-fashioned hag!” and all sorts of things will come on you!

There's a very big aggression on saints. They can't talk. They can't say anything. While even your own brothers and sisters and mother and father and children will do that, “Oh, you are very old-fashioned. It's nonsense!” Like that. It's not easy to exist with virtue in this country especially, and in the Western countries because now I know what it is.

My husband also doesn't drink so they tell him, “Oh, is it your wife who has forced you not to drink?” I mean, he said, “She doesn't say anything like that. Why do you blame Her?” Immediately [they say]. I mean, there's no shame about it of saying such a dirty thing! I mean, there is shamelessness, complete shamelessness about it. And not only drinking - all sorts of shamelessness goes about. You ask a lady, “Are you married?” “No! Why should I? I am not a fool like you!” It’s a typical answer. I mean, because you are married you have to look like a criminal! Because you are virtuous you should be crucified immediately. When you change that, with these people, you give up, naturally. I mean, you don't want to meet such people. And then they might say that you are cultish but it doesn't matter. I mean, we have to save ourselves. I mean, we do not want certificates from them! The certificate has to come from God, not from these people. They are incapable of giving us certificates. That you know very well.

So should we start? Something else?

Who are the new people today, for the first time? You? I am sorry I had to say all these things because today was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis in the beginning. And we are all going to enter into the same Realm and it will be handy for you to know what is expected of Sahaja Yogis, and with that expectation I request you not to pay attention to what I have said, much. You should not be frightened. It's not that frightening. You'll like it later on very much! What I have said it, you see.

So come forward. Those who have come for the first time, please come forward. You come for the first time? All right. Come forward! Will be better idea.

No, no, here, on the chair. On the first row of chairs. Will be a good idea. Yes.

Actually, it happens that your religion gets enlightened. You become that. Then you can't help it. What to do? I mean you don't have to tell, “Don't do! Don't do!” It just happens. You just can't do it. It's so helpful, isn't it? You just can't do it. You don't feel like doing it! Because if you are enjoying your Spirit you don't feel like doing nonsensical things.

It is better to get it and see for yourself what happens. All right?

That's the best way to give it a full chance.

Those who have come for the first time do come forward. You’ve come for the first time? Please come forward.

No! You are not for the first time!

Let her come forward here.

You are all for the first time here? No. You can go one step backward, is a good idea. You see, you can receive my vibrations even from there where Kingsley is. Isn’t it Kingsley? Aren’t you receiving my vibrations?

Much more! Yes that’s it.

Now this is a system which is built within us. That's why it is called as ‘Sahaja’. This is what is the system within us that exists. ‘Sahaja’ means ‘born with you’. This is all born with you. You have achieved it. It's all within you. It's a system that is built into this or built into that. In the same way it's a system built into you. You are just ready. You are to be put to the mains. That's all is the job is. For putting to the mains also there’s something built into you. If you see the triangular bone called as ‘sacrum’, means ‘sacred bone’, this Kundalini is there. This is the one that gives you your rebirth. By rebirth what happens [is] that your awareness, which is human awareness, becomes enlightened by your Spirit. Your Spirit comes into your awareness. So far your Spirit is not. Your Spirit knows all about you. It is in your heart. But you do not know about It.

So what happens [is] this Spirit, which is enjoying itself, enlightens your awareness and you get a new awareness by which you start feeling a cool breeze in your hand, a cool breeze in your hand. And this cool breeze, for the first time, on your central nervous system starts flowing. So you feel it, actually you feel it.

Now the enlightenment takes place of all these centres which are within you, which are there because of our evolutionary process. And these enlightened centres are on your fingers. They get enlightened too and you start feeling them within you. You start feeling your own centres and you start feeling the centres of others.

Now this happening takes place within you of the Kundalini awakening just to attract your attention inside. Because your attention is outside, you cannot take it in. You know many people think, “You put your attention here, you put your attention there.”  - it’s all wrong. It has to be spontaneously attracted inside and it's done by this Kundalini, and Kundalini is just like a germinating primule within us, a seed. It just rises spontaneously. And when it rises it breaks through here. And this is what is the real Baptism. You really feel it here coming out. You can feel the cool breeze coming out. You can feel the cool breeze from your hands. This is real Baptism that John the Baptist wanted people to have, and that Christ talked about.

All the religions have taught us to be in the centre. When they said, “Don't do this, don't do that,” they did not want to condition us but to tell us that how we are going to be in the centre. And when we are in the centre then what happens to us [is] that you get the desire to know your Spirit. And this desire is fulfilled through the awakening of the Kundalini. Now the Sahaja Yoga at this stage is really a Maha Yoga in the sense [that] it is the Great Yoga because many people can get Realisation. Thousands of people can get it because the blossom time has come. But even if they get Realisation, they are to be looked after, they are to be nourished, they are to be told about it. Everything should be decoded. You will be amazed - everything becomes so logical. Gradually you start understanding it. Your complete freedom is established.

Nobody says that, “Don't do this!” Nothing is said. But you just don't do it - yourself! I will not tell you as Moses had to tell, poor thing. He had to face all the mad people. But no, after Realisation it just happens and you just don't do it. You will not do it. It just happens to you. It is nothing to be told. It just happens. It works out. This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

In the beginning you have to be really ardent Sahaja Yogis. In the beginning you have to be. It's the beginning of Sahaja Yoga still in England, I would say. Really ardently attached to it by which you develop yourself very well and develop this tree of Sahaja Yoga in your own country. Because you have to save so many. The Last Judgment has started. It's started. Through Kundalini awakening only you judge yourself. You know what are the centres you are catching, what are your problems. You know what are the centres others are catching. You judge yourself.

Supposing a person comes and tell me, “Mother, my Agnya is very bad.” Do you know what it means? That, “My ego has developed.” But [if] you tell somebody, “You have got an ego.” - you will have a punch on your head! But the person himself comes and says, “Mother, I see my ego.” You start seeing yourself. You start seeing your problems, because you are out of it. And then you can cure it also and make it better. You improve it and you are better. You judge yourself and you judge yourself with love and understanding. You don't hate yourself by that. It's only you, yourself. You are going to judge. Within you is the power of God that judges you, is the Spirit which tells you. A rapport is established with the Spirit. The Spirit itself will tell you, “This is the mistake, this is the problem.” We don't need anybody to tell us. It's only you who will know. It’s only you who will judge yourself. It’s only you who will grow yourself. It's your own freedom. It's your own Self.

Your entire personality changes, entire personality changes. I have never told anybody not to take drugs as such, except for one or two people who were still carrying on. But also very mildly. And I told them how to get rid of it. But you just don't want to take them, just don't like it. You find it very filthy. You feel like vomiting. Just like that, the religion is enlightened in your stomach. That the time has come now for you to do it. That was the time when it was not so [then] they taught you how to do it. But today the time has come, it can work out. You are all just there.

The completion of the whole creation has to come this way. It has to work out. But you cannot reason it out. But once you get it - because it’s beyond reason, it happens beyond reason; the Kundalini awakens not by reason, spontaneously, by master only - once it happens then the whole thing becomes logical. You see, there's a microscope, then you can see through it. But if there is not a microscope, you cannot understand.  The ‘microscope’ is your Spirit.

It's very simple.

Now, I do not want to go into details about it. I think these people have been given... Gavin have you given them the papers and things?

Let them see for themselves. Have you all got the papers? Have you got? No? Let her have. Let this lady have. You sit a little erect, all right? Straight, sit little straight. All right.

You have to sit a little erect, not much, but a little erect. Not slouchy. Neither like this. Just sit straight.

Put your hands like this, all of you. Just put your hands.

Now close your eyes. Put your feet like this, little straight, on the ground. Not pressing much but they should be on the ground properly.

Come in! Come! There are three, four seats. Here, in front. Yes.

After Realisation you have to go very fast and try to understand it, otherwise you may lose your vibrations. That happens with some people. So be careful! It's a very, very delicate thing; it's very subtle. And because we are gross - suddenly we become subtle - if we do not catch up to it, we lose it also. So for one month after Realisation you have to be very, very careful and get hold of another Sahaja Yogis here and we also have an ashram here. We have to work it out.

Close your eyes. Just close your eyes. It just works. Just close your eyes. Don't think about it. Don't think. It will work out without thinking.

Put both the hands towards me, please. Both the hands like this.

One of the centres that is catching in most of you is that you all feel guilty for nothing at all, for nothing at all. It's a fashion to feel guilty. So everybody starts feeling guilty for nothing at all. Or maybe we confess and this and that. Now I have to tell you that not to feel guilty at all. Say that, “I am not guilty.”

Thrice you say, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

This is also a myth that you feel guilty. That will help you a lot.

Once you get your Realisation you have to also have the spiritual education to know how to handle this, how to handle this power. You are getting it because this is your own right, but you must know what you are getting.

They've got it, all of them.

All the Sahaja Yogis should receive vibrations and expose completely with their heart, absolutely. Just put it. Be meditative today. And you have to promise in your heart. You have to be much more active and ardent about Sahaja Yoga if you have to save your brothers and sisters. Only your heart can be binding, nothing else. Nothing else. It's only your heart. As you are attached to someone you love, you should be attached to your Spirit. Spirit you should love the most. Nobody is more important than your Spirit.

Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hands? Not yet? Close your eyes. Have patience with yourself. One has to have patience.

Close your eyes. Have patience! Just don't think. It will work out. Have patience with yourself! You put both the hands towards me, not meeting each other but towards me, separate. Put both the hands separately, not towards each other but towards me. Please put them towards me. Yes.

Close your eyes. Close your eyes. And just leave it. Don't think about it. Don't worry about it. It will work. It's like just a flower becoming a fruit - spontaneously.

Just close your eyes and put your hands towards me. Put your attention to your heart. Catch the joy part of it.

Just heart. Just put your both the hands towards me only and just pay attention to your heart. It will work out.

Are you feeling cool breeze? It's good, great. Just enjoy it. Just enjoy. Do not pay attention in one particular direction. Just leave it free. Just leave it free. Do not fix your attention anywhere. Just leave it free. It will work out.

Gavin, organise for these people behind. Ask people to slowly come along.

Keep your eyes shut. All new people please keep your eyes shut. They are going to check you.

One by one, yes move on. Jill, come forward.

Start moving in the centre. Yes. Good.

Those Sahaja Yogis who want to get themselves also checked up, ask other Sahaja Yogis to do it.

Magda, I think these three people are for the first time or what?

Just see them, their vibrations. They haven’t felt it yet.

Can you move a little coming up here. Marcus? Or who is there?

Those who want to be checked. Also ask others to be checked.

Douglas, go and check Dinesh.

All of you must get checking! Those of you who want checking should raise your hands. Ask people to check you.

Check her.

Vishuddhi, Left Vishuddhis are horrible. I don’t know what to say.

Hester [Spiro], you ask somebody to check you also. Peter [Pearce], you sit down.

David [Spiro] you sit down! Get yourself checked! Linda [Pearce], Peter, all of you. Please. Because I am going away. Let everybody be checked - better is. Marcus? You be checked also.

Better to get it done once for all. Get them checked.

Who can check her? Ray [Harris]? Where is he? Go and check Hester.

He’s got it?

Kingsley you check Hester, it’s better. He (Ray) is a Jew (also) so it would be better! (laughing) Somebody else should do it it’s better.

May God bless you!

But everybody gets checked it’s better!

John, you sit down. You get yourself checked. Sit down.

Marcus? Is he checked? How are they?

Now those who are checking should get themselves checked also, is a better idea. There should be nothing.

‘Prana’ - say the mantra for him. For her, Malcolm [Murdoch], ‘Prana’ is the mantra for her.

Haa! Done. Just broken through. Haaa!

Now this is to be judged a little by yourself. You should know. These are the small things that one should know.

This gentleman? Why don’t you see this gentleman?

Can you check John. John, put your left hand towards me and right hand outside.

Felicity [Payment]. Somebody should check Felicity also.

Brighton people should again get themselves rechecked afterwards.

Everybody should get themselves rechecked. Somehow or other get yourself cleared out. Every one of you. Gavin you also get yourself checked. Everybody should get yourself checked. That's the best way. And we should be thankful to people for checking us and giving us vibrations. Instead of getting angry and upset.

How are the children?  Jane [Brown] bring her. Is she alright? Bring her here.

How is it? Let everybody check today and give bandhans.

What about this gentleman? He’s got it? He’s Ray’s father, he should get it. Tell him not to feel guilty about anything! You are facing Mother who loves you! Just say, “Mother I am not guilty.”

Just say that. What guilt can you people have?

Jill? Coming?

Haaa! Alright Jill? It’s come up.

How is she?

Don’t talk. Just raise the Kundalini. Just raise the Kundalini.

You give him a bandhan.

Chaya, tumse karab dekho. Regis, you also get yourself checked and others should check and you check others. Every one of you.

John, please put yourself into a bandhan. Now check other people. Come along.

Those who have been checking sit down and those who have to be checked.

You’ve done it? Have you done? You’ve got it? Have you felt anything? Did you feel any cool breeze?  Good, great. Now close your eyes. Enjoy your Self. Now don’t stop at that!

What do you say Malcolm? Better?

What about this child?
