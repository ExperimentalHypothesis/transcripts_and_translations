Nishat Khan: Give me a little more treble [high pitch] in that part, treble, sharp.

Shri Mataji: Now first, you see, you saw all the- how all the clouds were coming taking all kinds, like big elephants nicely walking. And then the second part is played, if you see, listen to it properly, it is that people are asking for water; just asking that, "Oh God, let it rain ". So, the second part is like that. So, [Hindi]. Let him – you see now how he is asking, this is just asking.
And then the third pat would be when it starts raining, and how people are happy.
Nishat Khan: Difficult part for me.

[Conversation in Hindi with Nishat Khan]
Shri Mataji: He is touching everybody ‘heart, I’m telling him. Isn’t it true?
Sahaja Yogis: Yes!
[Applause]
[A string has broken]

Nishat Khan: Your listening of music is so beautiful. I was just telling Shri Mataji that She has actually, prepared all of you. I would even go as far ahead as saying that it is much more satisfying to play for you. I’m not saying anything further than that. But I would say, it’s much more satisfying to play for you than ...Because our music is very much based on the silence, as you know. And silence is something which some of us don’t like very much.

Hello. This raga, you see, is very similar to Marva, which you know very well. But it is at ‘dha’, you see. It stops more in Marva, he doesn’t stop, you see. Just the first strings, I thought it is Marva. But it is the right hand for Soni. Now the beauty of Soni raga, is this that it is coming from the heart. It’s absolutely from the heart. It comes from the heart and it expresses a feeling of, to Me, it expresses a feeling of love and joy. Booth things are in a very deep way, that is what I feel about it.
And sometimes like you get frustrated to express this love, you see. So, you feel that suddenly it comes out. I feel that way because it’s a – I don’t know how the artist is painting it himself, if he’s is feeling this way- But the, sometimes, you cannot express your love. It’s just [Hindi]

...And to enjoy again and again such a rapport, and such new dimensions I've seen today of music also. And the way he created today a new tune. I think in Bhairavi's tune was newly created. I never heard this before. What we call the beginning of the tune is we call as the ‘mukh’ is the ‘mouth’. And I never heard this before. So, maybe I may be wrong but I think he's created it today. [Hindi]
That's correct. Yes. He's humble and he said it's an old one. I've never heard this before. So, and the whole thing was that, today he's got his Realization.
[Applause]

Shri Mataji: So, he has technique no doubt, but the creativity knew no bounds. You could see that creativity went into all kinds of dimensions, and even when his one strip was broken, he was playing with it.
Now in the Indian music, as you know, one has to have tremendous balance and pose. But this is different style, where the balance pose is so spontaneous. There was no tension at all on his mind at all, I could see clearly. Just it was coming out so beautifully flowing. I would say that he was just feeling that he is playing and it is played. He was not thinking about it. Just he was playing, beautifully made today, and all My tribute to him.

Now of course this little present from our Sahaja Yogis to him is there. But apart from that, I wanted to give him some present but I'm in lost in this place ,where I don't know what to get and when I went to buy something, also the shops were closed. So, it’s a little present from Me, especially for his today's creativity.

[Applause]
He has brought such cheers and such applause from you, and I think this music has to spread quite a lot, all over the world, as it appeals to your heart. See, just see the way- I would say, when we talk to people, you see, we can just play the notes as they are. But then we can make it into a melody also, so that it becomes melodious and beautiful.

The third way could be to pull your strings and make it even more beautiful. And the fourth way could be to mix up sweet little, we call them ‘kadah’, means sweet little additional notes, little, little, bit here and there. And make it really, really, absolutely, what you can say a great fun, you can say a great fun. Or there is no word to it, because we call it ‘niranand’ that's what it is. You understand about ‘niranand’. So that is just joy, nothing but joy, such mirth, such mirth.
So all these little, little things, if you remember in our lives: how to deal with things, that how to talk to people, how to be sweet, at the same time dynamic, expressing yourself fully. But under current is extremely entertaining and sweet. I think Sahaja Yoga will spread very fast. May God bless you all.
Just see the tabla also ...
