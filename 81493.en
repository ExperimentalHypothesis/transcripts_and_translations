 (England)
The first time we sort of started getting somewhere was when this Indian guy turned up and started to teach us yoga. His name was Mukund Shah. He taught us a bit of Hatha yoga, a bit of Tai Chi, and a bit of TM. But he was always looking; I heard somebody describe him as a "yoga playboy," which was a pretty succinct description because he'd been to several different things. It was suggested to him by another false guru in India that he come to teach yoga in England, and so he started teaching us.

Then he found out about Shri Mataji coming here. It was Mukund Shah who went to the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, where Mother gave a talk. Being somewhat sceptical, he tried it on us. He said, "Look, I've met this woman who's a saint, and you get vibrations off her photograph. Would you like to try it?"

He was teaching us in this bank, which was in that area, that they used as a community centre. So we sat down and put our hands out, and we all felt different sensations. What I felt was like a ball of ice. It felt sort of spiky, but it was like a ball of ice melting in my hands.

"When was that, Doug?"

"That was different for Pat and I. We weren't there then."

"Well, that was with myself, Tony, and Gavin and Jane. Unfortunately, Gavin and Jane are no longer with us. But what date was that? Oh, that would have been '73... '74?"

"It was '75, actually. Because I was going to those Hatha yoga lessons, and I left before he told you about Shri Mataji. I'd moved over to Baker Street, and you hadn't met her then. So that was '75."

But anyway, he went to see Shri Mataji at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. And then, being somewhat sceptical, he tried it on us. He had this tiny little photograph of Mother, not much bigger than a postcard and in monochrome. We sat with our hands before it, and as I said, what I felt was a ball of ice in my hands.
