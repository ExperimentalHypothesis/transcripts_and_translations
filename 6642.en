Public Program. Melbourne (Australia), 10 March 1983.

To all the seekers of truth I bow. Dr. Reeves has spoken rather strongly today. I think he's a very great Australian to have that kind of a wisdom to see through the nonsense and the mockery that people were inflicting, on simple naive seekers from abroad. It requires a great intelligence and common sense to see through that. But the greatest of all is the desire to do good to others, to be touched by the agonies of others, to be upset, what others are suffering. This is the biggest thing that really brings you to the right point of understanding. What he said is absolute truth. I've been to all these gurus to find out what they have been up to. And they've been telling everyone that "She was my disciple." Another said, "She was my disciple." I just wanted to find out what are they doing to these people. How are they grabbing them and what are they managing? I knew the divine path, I knew the holy path, the pure path, but I didn't know the path of the crooks, of the antichrist and actually I had to find it out Myself. And that's how I went to all of these people in a garb that - I've come to learn, they never recognised Me. What you do and all those things.

And that's how I've been able to find out methods in the permutation, combinations of your barriers, how to achieve en masse realisation. In the beginning of My life I started with normal, common people, intelligent people, educated people in all walks of life. I had to go through various types of phases in which I met all types of people, and I could, through My subtle methods, find out what are the barriers. But the worst of all, which concerned Me the most of all, was that the great seekers of the ancient times have gone into such mesmerism, into such ego-pampering processes that how will they retreat back? It was a big concern to Me.

I have tried after getting so many normal people first to Sahaja Yoga, then to these combinations. I must confess that it is not easy to give realisation to people who have been to those gurus. Day in and day out I have to work out the permutations and combinations of barriers, of terrible barriers within them. It's not a easy thing, but, thank God, I have achieved it by My own love and concern. Still I must tell you those who belong to some guru are very difficult people for realisation. Last year in Melbourne we had about I think fifty people like that and it was impossible to give them realisation and they even tried their level best, they found it difficult to get it while a drunkard could get it in no time, an alcoholic could get it in no time, a prostitute could get it in no time. Can you imagine? What harm is done within yourself that, it is not easy to give them realisation. And even if they get realisation, because they are so ego-orientated they fall back. They mock, that's the only thing they can do. They're least bothered about their own realisation. They are not
bothered. They're identified with that idea that they belong to some sort of a cult and they always try to be with them.

Even in Perth we went, then in Adelaide I found these, some of them are paid by gurus to come and disturb us. To that extent these people who are seekers of God are going down. They've no eyes, no sensitivity to feel what is the truth is. And they're not bothered about their own well-being. This is the worst thing, that is happening to them. It's a thing of concern. Every time I have an interview anywhere in Australia, or America, anywhere they ask Me such questions that why not your government stops these things. Why not your government do something about these people. They have amassed so much of money. This Muktananda now, we have learnt officially he has got sixty thousand rupees worth of diamonds and both the disciples are fighting over that. Still, you see it is impossible for people to assert that whatever has happened has happened, it's a naiveness we went into. Let us get to the real thing. They just can't think of it. And, anything that guru says they listen to it not even logically think about it. Moreover if you talk to them they don't know anything about reality.

Now as you have seen Warren, then you have seen William, there are all these Sahaja Yogis are equipped with complete knowledge about Kundalini and how to give realisation and how to cure people, what are the problems. I mean William, I have never told him anything about it as such. But he has given realisation to so many people in your Melbourne. So you start manifesting your own powers and you don't live on some sort of an ego that you belong to some cult or anything, but you belong to yourself. Every individual becomes a beautiful flower, that's what we have to expect within ourselves. That's what really you are seeking. Not to be called into this guru or that guru, but your own guru within yourself, is your Spirit. Is the Shiva's Spirit within you. Today of course he has already told you about these three centres which I would like to deal with you.

The first centre that I dealt and the second and third are very important, but these higher centres are playing a very vital role in our being. The one which is the heart centre is looking after the security of God's children. When a person sees something horrible this centre starts pulsating fast. Till the age of twelve years the sternum bone which is placed in the ribs here, as you know, creates antibodies to fight any invasion within, whether mental, emotional or physical. These antibodies get distributed till the age of twelve years throughout your body. And when this sternum gets the message it starts shaking and it conveys, communicates, through no nerves or arteries or ways any connection known so far, to these antibodies that they should all fight. They fight the disease, they fight also the things, what you call possessions. They also fight your own mistakes. That's why this is a very important centre within us.

If a lady is an insecure woman, if she feels insecure then this centre is always in a pulsating mood. And that's how it makes all the antibodies very tired, because they're all the time in a state of emergency. Also these cults have used this method of putting people onto emergency. Give them exercises by they jump, jump, jump or something like that. Now you can ask any doctor, this kind of jumping without any support can create impotency in a personality. Now this is very physically used method by these people to make them nervous by making this centre move very fast. Now when these antibodies are tired they become absolutely numbed down and they cannot find any strength to fight any aggression. Now in everyday life also if some lady as I told you is nervous and she has problem and she's always afraid then what happens that this system start exerting itself too much - ultimately it gets sick and then she can develop a disease called the breast cancer.

This breast cancer is very common now-a-days among women in the West. Because the motherhood of the lady is challenged. This centre is bestowed upon by the deity of Mother of the Universe. And when the lady finds that her motherhood is challenged then she starts feeling very nervous, this centre goes into over-activity and then she developed this cancer of the breast, troubles of the breast, all kinds of such troubles because the antibodies have become now very weak. On the left-hand side of this centre is the centre what we call as the left heart centre. But beyond that is residing the Spirit, in your heart, in the organ, separated from everyone. The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within yourself. And the Kundalini is the Holy Ghost which is the power of God, which is the Primordial Mother, expressed within you as the Kundalini. So we have got within us that power, Shakti, and the Shiva, sitting in your heart. So this Kundalini has to rise to give you realisation. The baptism, the real baptism. Not an artificial one.

Now it can happen in the person is a problem. It used to happen. What knowledge I am telling you is not the knowledge of today. Is the knowledge of very, very ancient times. Fourteen thousand years back Markandeya, a great poet in India, has written about it. After that there were many other poets who wrote about it, till in the sixth century, Adi Shankaracharya very clearly wrote about the Kundalini in his [INAUDIBLE]. Nobody has said so far from those ancient writers, the Kundalini gives you any problems, or She makes you dance, jump and all that, is all modern nonsense. Traditionally nobody has said so. Sixth century is the time when Adi Shankaracharya incarnated on this earth. Buddha got his realisation without doing any dancing or anything. You know for definite.

So this new idea of all these happenings are done by a generation of these horrible people in these last fifty years. I would say there has been a holy trinity as well as a unholy trinity. These people preceded the others who were to come to execute what they wanted to do. These antichrists had two types of things, because how to neutralise also the writings of the ancient times. Like Freud was one of them. There are some more. They came down like this and wrote some things to uproot human beings completely, first of all, from reality. And then another lot came in for using that as a written thing for them, because writing is something great and then preaching what these people have preached using that as a base, to express themselves.

You see all hand-in-gloves knowledge. But if you read any ancient book which, many are not translated because nobody's interested in that. They diverted all our attention from the sublime to absolutely wretched life. And this uprooting has taken place because these are antichrist activities. They are all joined together, they never talk against each other, that's one thing great about them. And Christ has said that satan is not going to talk against his own house. They praise each other, meet each other, I have seen them behaving like that. Give them presents. This one gives presents to another. Big fraternity exists between them. Great fraternity, no problem within. But the real saints in India who are living in the forest and Himalayas, into the hills and dales I should say, hidden away from you people, are just quite aware that these are antichrists.

The first thing that happened when these people started manifesting themselves - India is very good at astrology, so as soon as their birth date came in they just cast their horoscope and said, "Now let's see what's in their horoscope." So, most of them changed their birthdates also. Nothing consistent. And when you ask them why you're not consistent, they said change is the way the life is, but that is life. You are talking of something eternal. How can eternal change? It's very difficult to make people take to eternal life than to make them take to just mundane life. You know that. Now see there's a show on today how many castes there are and how many people there are to see that. But to take to real life, it takes time, otherwise why is it all the great saints and all the great prophets and incarnations were tortured by human beings? Why did they torture them? So this is one of the things one has to realise, that the Spirit resides in your heart which is the Sat Chit Ananda as they say, is the one which is the truth, which is the attention, and which is the joy.

Now first of all we must understand what is attention. What is God, who is an attention. What does that mean. God who is the attention means, God knows about everything that's happening. He's aware of what is happening in this world. He's the only spectator of the drama of life which is created by His power, the Primordial Mother. He knows each and everything about us, whatever He wants to know, He can find out. There is no problem about it. So He's the knower and He's the knowledge too. So when we become realised we have to know, through our awareness we have to become collectively conscious and this is a very important point which we must remember. It's not very difficult to understand that you have to become something more. Only by wearing some dress or putting something in your neck what do you become?

Some people tell Me, "We lead a very good life Mother so it should be all right." But good life is according your concept. Even according to the divine concept if it is a good life, for what? Everybody will ask, for what, why do want to lead such a religious life, for what? What is the need to have such a life, one should ask oneself, why to lead such a life which is so conditioned? The answer is, you have to have balance to ascend. If you do not ascend what's the use of building up this balance within you? The purpose is to ascend. If you cannot transcend, then, this is just a binding, your mental projection, that you should lead this kind of a life and that kind of life. Is just your mental process.

But when the Spirit ascends then all the religions are born with you. They get enlightenment, you just don't do things which are wrong. Just don't do it you, you just don't like it, as we have told you that there are people who gave up their drugs and things overnight. Is a fact. Because as soon as this happens the enlightenment brings forth complete new awareness which refuses to have anything that is not good for this body. You just have the things that are good for your body, for your life. You don't have to fight with yourself that, "O God, how will I give up?" In the morning, you say I will not drink in the night but in the night you drink. So in the beginning there is no need in Sahaja Yoga, today to say that don't do this and don't do that. There's no need at all. Once it is enlightened within you, you just look after yourself. But when the Spirit starts coming in your attention you become collectively conscious and you know. You know, again.

It's not mental projection. You know about yourself. You know what centres are catching on your fingers, you can feel fingertips. You can say, you know on your fingertips. And you know about others also. And also if you really learn the complete technique which is very easy to learn, within a week you can learn it, you can help another and yourself very well to rise above this level to a higher level. People have all kinds of fears these days. It's a very abnormal situation. They don't have any joy. Only fear. They live with fear. They were telling Me this person who cannot live out in the space, there's fear of even building bad oxygen, then they have fear of germs touching them and all those things are there. They have lost confidence in life.

By awakening of this centre within you, you become absolutely a normal person. You have no fears. Because nothing that is wrong can attack you. You are well prepared for it. There's a strength within you which really makes you very confident. That's why this centre is very important for us to know that this centre gives us that strength, that confidence.
The other day, every program, they ask Me another question, "What do you think about Australians?" Which is a very, very common question I've found. I said that they're great people, very nice people. But they lack only one thing is complete confidence in themselves. They haven't got that confidence that they should have. They are not aggressive people. They are not bothered about aggressing other territories or anything. But a kind of a diffidence is still in them which they should get rid of. Completely. You are the people who belong to God.

And why should you have any diffidence about it? But this diffidence is completely finished when you get this centre awakened within you. To get this centre awakened you have to do nothing. The Kundalini herself rises and if you have any problem in that centre she comes back again. She rises with a greater force and hits there, opens it out and awakens the deity of that centre so that you feel very confident. Today if you see, Dr. Warren so confident, I must tell you, he was not, he was quite diffident. He thought you all are going to beat him when he tells you all these things. But today he's a changed man.

Now we have on the right hand side of this is another part of the centre which we call as right heart. This centre is the father's centre and the left heart is the mother's centre. So if your fatherhood is challenged in any way or also husband wise we can say that. If the husband is not loyal to his wife and is playing tricks with her, he gets this into trouble. But physically he feels it very much because he gets asthma from her. Asthma one develops, but this is more the centre of the father. If the fatherhood of the person is not all right.

For example if a girl has lost her father and she has never seen him she might develop asthma. If the grandfather had asthma the child might develop asthma. It comes from the father's side. Anybody who has asthma problems should know that there is something wrong in the fatherhood side. Maybe the father is sick and you are worried, maybe you are a good father, but the son is not all right so you are suffering, anything like that, you see could be responsible for this asthma. But if the deity here is awakened you can be all right and you can get rid of your asthma, quite all right. On the left hand side is the centre of your mother. If the mother has died very early such a person is a nervous person and such a person also doesn't trust anyone. He can become secretive by nature, sulking type. He may not open his heart to anyone because he doesn't trust anyone.

Some people who have no mother whom they have not known may become extremely cautious by nature because they think they have to look after themselves, extremely cautious. But with Sahaja Yoga you can awaken this centre and you become a complete personality, without any fear, without any nervousness and without any malice to your parents. Actually after Sahaja Yoga, I have found, many people who have just forgotten their parents, have been very angry with their parents, given them up, would not forgive them, went back to their parents. We had a French girl in England who had not seen her mother for eighteen years and the mother was alone, a widow lady, but after realisation, she has a tremendous feeling. She went back and looked after her mother and also started doing Sahaja Yoga there.

It's a very, very common thing that you start expanding your heart to others. You start loving other people, you start understanding them. I know of a man in America, I gave him realisation and he said, most surprising, "I went to the race this time. I said this would be the last time I go to a race and there I find my uncle and I wished him, and he was amazed, he looked, started looking at me, because I had not wished him all these years at all. He just started, he was quite amazed at my attitude. And now he has become a great friend of mine." So the friendship which is a pure friendship, is not homosexual and all nonsense, but a pure friendship based on pure relationship develops. And then you don't feel insecure.
In a society where even a mother's love is challenged one would feel extremely insecure in a thing like that. If a mother has to love the child she has to think, "I hope there is no bad feeling in my mind." In America it happened. There was a little boy of eight years, just a little boy of eight years and her [Shri Mataji may mean "his"] mother said that he has started taking lot of drugs and things and these drugs have created a problem for this little boy of eight years, can you imagine?

So I couldn't bear it, I just took the boy to My heart and I kissed him, he said, "Mother, this is never done to me by my mother." So I asked the lady, "Why didn't you do this to your child? He's only eight years of age, doesn't he love your care, and your expression of your love?" So she said, "Mother I feel guilty." I said, "How?" "Freud has said..." Freud was a perverted useless fellow. He died of cancer, look at his life. These psychologists when they come in contact with other people who are suffering from pathological troubles, they are pathological cases, and when they deal with pathological cases, they don't know how to protect them. Jung has said about it. Then they catch those diseases among themselves and they start generalising this for everyone. They have generalised. It's an absurd thing. In Rome there was a girl who came to Me she said, "Ah psychologists, horrid, horrid, horrid." I said, "What happened?" "They're telling me I have bad eyes towards my father. I felt like beating them." Is all absurd things, you see to create - this is antichrist, to create a feeling of enmity, that everything is perverted, polluted. It's so pure.

In India nobody can understand this. Thank God these Freud and all these people just touched the periphery of India and it's like an elephant. So nobody is there and nobody believes it. So I have to tell you this that there is no such thing as polluted relationship or bad relationship. Is all pure relationships. We must understand we are not animals. Even animals have got sense, so do you think we won't have the sense of purity within us and holiness within us? So all these ideas also drop out completely and you develop a personality. You live with others. In the ashram now we have many girls, boys, they're all are like brothers and sisters. There is no problem on that.

Now we have the other centre which we call as the Vishuddhi Chakra. This is a very important centre which is bestowed upon by Shri Krishna Himself. The right Heart by Shri Rama and left Heart by Uma, or you can call Her the wife of Shiva; while the centre Heart is bestowed upon by the Mother called Jagadamba, who is the one who helps people to cross this ocean of illusion, and to protect them. This is the Divine Mother. The other day you were asking Me about Divine Mother, this is one of the glimpse of Her.

So now the other centre which we have here is very important centre, called as the Vishuddhi Chakra. This is the centre Vishuddhi. One is shuddha means "pure" but ‘vishuddha’ means "absolutely pure". This has got sixteen petals as we have got the cervical plexus expressed in the gross which has also got sixteen sub plexuses. It tallies with medical science completely. Now this Vishuddhi Chakra is bestowed upon by the deity of Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna is the one which is the evolution of the Vishnu tattwa, from there upward to the state of Primordial Being. He's the one who resides as the Primordial Being, as the whole, as Akbar. When Mohammed Sahib talked of Akbar he talked of Shri Krishna. This is the finger [Shri Mataji shows both index fingers] which represents this centre and He said, "Put these into your ears and say 'Allah hu Akbar' you get in connection with the Viraata."

Now what Sahaja Yoga does is to make you in contact with the whole. It makes you in contact with the whole. It's not that it limits you but it makes you one with the whole. So one must understand that what you have to achieve in your realisation, is just not talk of Shri Krishna, just singing about...which is absurd. People don't understand that in Oxford St we find people with all these nonsensical things going on; begging, asking for alms. I feel it's such a insult to Shri Krishna that people in His name are begging. But is done in all religious movements that people beg in the name of God. There is no need to beg. First you equip yourself with the blessings of God then there is no need for you to beg at all and begging is against God's realisation, against Self-realisation. You must have self-esteem. That's one thing very important. If you do not have self-esteem you cannot get realisation. Why should you go on the streets and beg is absolutely absurd, is a showing-off thing which is of no use to yourself. By doing this you are really corrupting the name of Shri Krishna. But, if you take the right path, if this centre is awakened your hands become connected with the Primordial Being and you become, your hands become collectively conscious. Medically they accept that the extremities have got something to do with the sympathetic nervous system. That far, no more than that.

But in Sahaja Yoga you'll be amazed that the vibration starts flowing through your hands when you take the name of Shri Krishna. And these vibrations, when you want to find out what are these, then you'll be amazed they're relayed to your centres within yourself. Even if you get ten children who are realised souls and tie their eyes and ask them about a person who is sitting before them what's wrong with him they will say one finger or this finger or this finger or two fingers. Because you can feel the charring, you can feel sometimes a kind of a heat. Sometimes you may feel the numbness. If you feel the numbness on your fingers then you must know the person has to die. So many things you can know, all the permutations of these seven centres and this one. One, five and six and seven. So we have seven centres.

To understand about the centres first you must get your realisation, that is important. In the beginning you'll find the vibrations are coming, going, coming, going. It is not steady. First you must steady yourself. Then you can find out, from your hands, what are the centres catching because these vibrations are nothing but the Power of God is flowing through you. They understand, these vibrations, they co-ordinate, they are life's force. They're the one who create all these living things like they are the one who sprout a seed, they are the one who transform the flower into a fruit. All living work is done by these vibrations which is called as chaitanya, Aum, Ruh, cool breeze of the Holy Ghost and all-pervading power of God. That starts flowing through you, first time you feel them. Yesterday many people felt it and people were very happy that so many felt it because that's a sign that here many people are going to get realisation. You don't have to go anybody, you just have to practice little bit and find out. You become such an expert. One person in India who got realisation has so far given realisation to at least ten thousand people in a village. Many villages. He's a very ordinary man. We wanted him to come but was a kind of a visa problem, so he could not come. He's a very simple farmer and he got his Self-realisation and he knows so much about Sahaja Yoga that you be amazed, he has not been to any university, to any college or anything, but he is so knowledgeable. Because once you have these vibrations they guide you. So the Spirit sitting in your heart guides you and tells you what is right and what is wrong. If you have to ask a question, "Mother, is there God?" If you ask this question immediately there will be a tremendous flow saying that it is there.

Now how to understand that these are the vibrations of God, also this question can come. We can judge them relatively. For example in one of the programs in Puna people invited Me to speak in a place which was owned by Brahmins and they opposed it, they said, "She's not a Brahmin so we will not have Her here." So they said, "All right, we will publish in the newspaper, because Her name has gone in the newspaper, we'll tell them that these people are so Brahminic they don't want to have Her." Of course they didn't want to have that bad name so they said, "Let's have Her." These people never told Me what happened. Suddenly I said, those who are Brahmins, come down. So four or five came and sat before Me, these are Brahmins without knowing the Brahma. So I said, put your hands before Me and they just started shaking like this and going back. I said, "What's happening to you?" They said, "Mother, you are Shakti that's why it's happening to me, to us," but I said "What about the others, it's not happening to others." So they turned round and said, "Look at these, they are also doing like this." I said, "Ask them from where do they come." They went and asked them, they said, "We are coming from the lunatic asylum of Thana."

So these fanatics who believed that they were Brahmins were reacting the same way as these lunatics and they believed that they were Brahmins. They were not supposed to touch anybody. There were untouchables people and there were, the one that gave them realisation was from so-called untouchable, a shoemaker. Now he's become their guru of all these Brahmins and he's teaching them about God. So this centre gives you the power to be one with the whole. It has many powers but the main power it gives you is the power to be one with the whole and to have all the powers of that deity within you awakened so that you can become aware and make others also aware of it. Those people who talk too much catch on the right Vishuddhi. Those who do not talk at all catch on the left, those who feel guilty catch on the left. Those who think they are all right and aggressive, catch on the right, it's like that. So this has to be understood in the right perspective, that if you misuse this centre what happens to you, so how you should give yourself a balance to improve that.

But the best part of Sahaja Yoga is this, that when you give them realisation they're separated from themselves. They'll come and tell Me, "Mother, my Agya Chakra is catching." So if you ask them, "Really?" "Yes Mother, very much." That means they're suffering from too much ego, but can you imagine anybody saying, "Mother, I'm suffering from too much ego." Because you are separated from yourself you see your ego, the big balloon like thing, you say, "Mother, please remove my ego." That is how people talk to Me. They will tell Me, "Mother, I talk too much. that's why my right Vishuddhi is catching, you better cure it, I must stop my talking too much." So you start correcting yourself because you get separated from yourself, you become the Spirit and the rest you see. Like I see My sari, if there's a spot, I would like to clean it, I'm not identified with the spot. So that is how it happens, you are no more identified with yourself and you start seeing the faults with you and you try to correct it. That's how you become a beautiful person by your own attention, not by anybody else, it is you who has to do it.

Now we have a very important centre here called as Agya Chakra. This is bestowed upon by the great incarnation of Lord Jesus Christ. We have no idea as to how this incarnation has come on this earth because if you just read Bible it is a little bit of Christ. We see they allowed Him to live only for about four years to talk to people, within four years He was killed, so He had no time to tell you all about it. But He did the job what He was supposed to do and which He achieved in His lifetime but if you read some books in other scriptures like Devi Mahatmayam where the Goddess was the one who created Him, and how She created and what She did to Him and everything is given in detail and in every detail, you'll be surprised, is the life of Christ. Only thing there He's called as Mahavishnu and not as Christ. But even the name of Christ comes to Him from the same heritage which I was telling you, that His name was Yeshu not Jesus, because in the Bible I get Myself confused when I read that Anna was not Anna it was Hannah. John was Yohan, every name has been corrupted in the English Bible.

In the same way they have corrupted Christ's name, Yeshu into Jesus, actually some people called him Jesu. This is the name given to him by Shri Radhaji, the one who was the power of Shri Krishna. She's the one who gave Him this name because She was very much indebted to the foster mother of Shri Krishna who was Yeshoda and that's why She called Him Yeshu. Yeshu is the word in Hebrew language and we call Yeshoda as Yeshu, also some people in our what you call in a country language, call her the same thing as Yeshu. You know that Y's and J's are sort of brought together like "Yugoslavia", they call it as Jugoslavia. So his name Yeshu comes from that and that's how He was created as a special one, in the Devi Mahatmayam it is said that Krishna has said that you will become the support of the universe.

Now in India people were seriously waiting for Mahavishnu to come and tell them, that Mahavishnu has been born. But the people who went to India they had Bible in one hand and pistol in other hand or a big gun or maybe a huge big cannon and that's how they entered India and they said that you must get converted. Now what is a conversion, God only knows. You can take a donkey and put a thing on that [Shri Mataji indicates across forehead] and you're Christian. You don't become a Christian. That's how they spread Christianity throughout India which was all absurd type of Christianity. I was also born in one of the Protestant Christian families. My father was a realised soul, My mother was another, they were very learned people and My father told Me, "God, look at this now, what are these Christians doing to Christ." And he was the one who fought for Independence, he went to jail, My mother went to jail and he was member of our constituent assembly, parliament and all that but Christians only started recognising him when he became a member of something or a mayor of a place. They had no other idea of a person that somebody has spiritual endowment or any sort of a spiritual powers. Now, in our family we were very much with Gandhiji, all of us, we sacrificed a lot for the country and My father decided to marry us all out of community, not among Christians, because he thought these Christians are so much worshipping these missionaries, they would even pray for their health, health of their dog and health of their umbrellas. It was such a wretched condition of these Christians in those days, I mean so dedicated they were to these missionaries. The missionaries were only busy converting people.

Now this Mahavishnu tattwa, the one who was born as Christ was never understood, never told, they never read anything about it, and never found out. So Indians believed that so far Mahavishnu is not born and so it continued with the idea that we have to still go on because in the principle Mahavishnu it was written that not only You will be the support of the universe but You will have such purity within you, because He is the Omkara, He's the Chaitanya, He's the vibrations, that's why He could walk, that's why He was resurrected. That it was said that when His Advent will come He will cross this path, this is the cross, the resurrection part, and by His advancement He will be able to suck in the ego and superego within you, the karmas, the conditionings, the ego in you, by which people will get their realisation. So Indians continued with the idea that we have still to pay for our karmas, Mahavishnu has not come, because of misrepresentation. Once I told them that Christ was Mahavishnu you see thousands are getting realisation because they believe in Mahavishnu, they of course respect Christ very much but they did not know that He was Mahavishnu. If He's Mahavishnu it's perfect and that's how He was enlightened and the people got their realisation in no time because they're educated in Him, they know what it is you see.
These missionaries just read some Bible in some schools and all that and came down but they did not know how to correlate the whole thing. You see it cannot be truth just in Bible, it has to be everywhere and that is what happened when they came down and they told us something which was not Christ.

Now this thing happens to us also, that when kundalini rises, Christ is born within you here, He's awakened within you and when He is awakened, ego and superego both are sucked in and you get a space here and when you get that space here the kundalini shoots off and that's how you feel the cool breeze on your head. I have given at least seven lectures continuously on Christ in a church called as Unity church. It was again the unity and fraternity of all the horrible people, they were preaching about Rajneesh, at least Rajneesh is a antichrist, anybody can see. When Christ had said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes", to that extent His purity has gone, how can you accept Rajneesh as a guru for any spirituality? But they had books from all kinds of horrible people. They had no books which were ancient books with them, nothing, no knowledge of any kind. Indians don't depend, the real Indians I mean, not the Westernised pseudo Indians who have been to Cambridge and Oxford but those who are real Indians don't depend on these books, they think it's all trash that has come and will go away. It has no meaning and they had all these books put there to destroy really the unity within us, lies, when you become collectively conscious. All this work has been done in the ancient times, as Mohammed was one of the prophets who came out of the ten prophets, Moses, Abraham, Lao Tse, then we had also people like other prophets, Socrates. Recently in India the last one we had the Sai Nath, not the satya one, but the Sai Nath who lived who was representing this great principle of Primordial Master.

So this is the story of your evolution. The last is the most important centre is the Sahastrara which is open today, open from 1970, fifth May, that we can feel the Sahastrara opening out. About this centre also if you go to My centre you'll find many, many tapes which will explain to you this centre, the only thing is that all the seats of all the subtle centres within us lies along the line like this and all the centres are within us. This is the Agya Chakra and that's how it moves. This is the Vishuddhi Chakra, this the Heart, this the Nabhi, what you call the solar plexus, then we have got in the centre here is the Mooladhara and around it is what you call the Swadisthan. That is why when the Swadisthan goes out or you can get diabetes, you get blindness, blindness is due to the fact that your Swadisthan is not all right. Many people get blindness, when their eyes open can be cured by Sahaja Yoga. In Geneva I cured a lady in ten minutes time, it's all due to possessions that you get in. Coming to the Agya Chakra one has to say that all these chakras have movement on both the sides. One moves to the collective subconscious, another moves to the collective supraconscious.

Now if at the Agya Chakra you start moving like that in the collective subconscious you start seeing all the dead things, like great deities, or you can also start seeing - past you can say. If you move to the right then you start seeing colours and also you start seeing lights and all those things, with LSD also you can do it, if you take LSD. Many who used to take LSD and were suffering from coma just came to Me and they just never saw Me, they just saw the lights. So that is not the right thing to see Me as light or as some previous deity. Is to see Me as I am, is the present. So we have to be in the present. Sahaja Yoga brings you to the present moment by which you enjoy every moment of life in its all dynamics and that's how you become a dynamic, loving affectionate, relaxed personality. May God bless you all, thank you very much.

Three days have been very good. I would expect you also to come on Sunday morning, not at seven o'clock as he said, but ten o'clock Sunday morning to our ashram which he will tell you the address. Please come along and you can also have your lunch with us. I hope we will be able to cook something of all of you because this your Mother's house and in a Mother's house you must at least eat your food. That's what it is, it's very personal, it's very intimate, is not like the guru sitting on the seventh storey and all everybody bowing to him, is not like that. It's absolutely personal, individual, and everybody is given full proper attention, and respect in Sahaja Yoga. May God bless you.

Today we'll not have any questions because we have had too many of them before and wasted lot of time. Let us have it without questions, without asking anything you can get your realisation. So tell your mind to ask questions later on. Once you have got realisation you won't ask so just tell your mind which is working all the time and giving you some ideas, tell it to wait because by thinking you have achieved nothing so far. By mental conception you have not achieved anything because after all this mind is a limited thing and you have to be triggered into unlimited space and for that if you think you cannot reach there.

So actually first thing that happens to you that your thought stops when the kundalini crosses Agya and when you feel this cool breeze you absolutely get calmed down and relaxed. Yesterday was a great experience for people. I'm sure today also it will work out the same way. You have to do exactly as I tell you which is a very simple thing, you don't have to do anything great, just take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us, just take out your shoes.

Just take out your shoes, sit comfortably, if you have anything tight on your body just remove it, but keep yourself comfortable. Put your hands on your laps, one thing is you have to be comfortable so that during the process you don't feel any uncomfortable feeling, so please just put both the hands towards Me first of all, just hands like this. Now you have to close your eyes. Please don't open your eyes because if you open your eyes the kundalini won't cross the Agya Chakra, so please don't open your eyes till I tell you. Is nothing is going to happen, there's nothing to have any fear, everything is going to be all right, but I must warn some people have a habit of showing off and they start going into a funny contortions and that's not needed at all, here. It is something that happens inside, antar yoga. Nothing happens outside, it happens inside so you be sensible and wise. Take your realisation is the best thing you can do to yourself and to anybody else.

So put both the hands towards Me and just close your eyes. Just close your eyes, all of you should close your eyes, even if you have spectacles you can remove because it also improves your eyesight, so remove your spectacles. Sit very comfortably, don't worry about others, just now you have to think about yourself. Now left hand as he said is the power of desire so put it left hand on your lap towards Me, that is not to be removed. Only use your right hand to raise your kundalini on different chakras on the left hand side throughout. So we put our right hand on the heart with full confidence. Now, as I've said, you have to have confidence. On the heart - if there's anything in your pocket you'd better take out and if it's a coat or anything put it inside - put it on your heart, press it a little bit and say with full confidence, "Mother, I am the Spirit." Feel no hesitation in saying that you are the Spirit, you are not the body, mind and this ego. You are the Spirit.

Close your eyes, all of you, keep your eyes shut, even if they're not shutting press them a little, they'll shut down. They must relax. Don't say mechanically, with full confidence I said. Please say, "Mother, I am the Spirit." Now put down this hand on the left-hand side, on the left-hand side of your stomach. Now this is very good for you because the principle of guru resides in the stomach area.

So you put your right hand on the stomach on the left-hand side and press it a little bit with your fingers, fingertips. At this point you have to say ten times, "Mother, I am my own guru" again with great confidence and understanding and respect for yourself, with all your self esteem, "Mother, I am my own guru." Please put your left hand straight towards Me, both the legs should be straight on the ground, little apart from each other. Now you raise your right hand now upward again to your heart position, put it on your heart again and now twelve times you have to say, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

Now put the same hand on the left hand side of your neck, right hand on the left hand side of your neck on the left Vishuddhi as we call it, at this point sixteen times you have to say, "Mother I am not guilty" because you have been feeling guilty for nothing at all. Sixteen times, there are sixteen sub plexuses, you have to say sixteen times with full confidence, "Mother I am not guilty."

Now raise this right hand onto your forehead, after saying sixteen times. At this point you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone" because you know this is the centre of Christ and Lord Jesus Christ has given us a prayer which is the mantra which is the chanting of this centre is, so you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone" because if we do not forgive others, God is not going to forgive us. Without feeling guilty you have to say, "God forgive us because we forgive all those who have done harm to us."

Without feeling guilty again I'm saying, without feeling guilty, with all confidence. The guilt is too much in you people. What is the guilt for, you see, what are you guilty of, as I've said yesterday God is the ocean of love, ocean of forgiveness, ocean of compassion. Trust Him. Not to feel guilty and say that, "Mother I forgive everyone." Now put this hand on top of your head, on top of your head where it's a fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood and try to press it. You'll find a little heat coming out. Now raise the hand little higher, about four inches and see if there's a cool breeze coming out. If not, change the hand, put your right hand towards Me and left hand on top of your head, otherwise also you can do it. Again, change over, again and again, and see if there's a cool breeze coming out.
At this point you have to ask for your realisation, I cannot cross your freedom, so you have to say, "Mother, I want my realisation, Mother I want my realisation, please give me my realisation" anything like that.

Now you may open your eyes and put your hands like this, just like this. All of you put your hands and ask a question in your heart, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, is this the Brahma Shakti, is this the all-pervading power of God?" The breeze you are feeling is not the breeze from any air conditioner or anything, is the breeze. Now put down your hands and see for yourself. Again I'll tell you how to raise your own kundalini, please follow me. This will take about two minutes more but it will help you to establish yourself. We have left hand in front of the kundalini like this and you have to move the right hand up, forward, lower, backward, like that, you have to move. Now, start it off. Keep your eyes open, start moving your kundalini. Just see how I'm doing it.

Now, take it up on your head, take it up on your head, stretch your hands up there and give it a twist. A nice twist and give a knot to your kundalini, because your hands are now powerful, you are working through your hands. Now again start it. Do it again. But do it properly, you should do it this way as I'm saying it to you. Not the other way round. Now take your hand up there, give it a twist, again and give it one knot. For the third time you have to give three knots because of three powers. Let's do it again please. Do it with full understanding that your hands are powerful, there is power flowing through your hands. Only thing that you want - that it should be established. Now one, two, three. Now see in your hands, how do you feel? All right. Those who came for the last two days definitely are feeling. Even people who came yesterday might be feeling, most of them. Those who have come for the first time may not be but doesn't matter, it is going to work out. You are all going to come and see Me on Sunday. I'll be very happy to meet all of you.

Now if you have any personal problems, you can come and see Me just now. Thank you very much. But not for a long time. It's already nine o'clock, so for about half an hour I'll be here. Thank you very much. But when you come on Sunday please bring some sugar, salt and oil with you and water. Not too much, little bit. But not so little also, bring at least half a kilo, or quarter of a kilo.
