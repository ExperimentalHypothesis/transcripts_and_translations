Shri Mataji: Of Kundalini awakening like this ...You are very talented ...

It is a real talent you people have I never knew ...And she is telling me -You never use to dance and you were never on the stage before. And you have done so well. Nobody could believe it...We have a nice film now, We can show it around the whole world. I don't know who envisage the whole thing, who saw the whole vision and Who organised it so well...

Even the Hindi version was so, absolutely accurately done...

I have no words to thank you but the whole thing has gone to my heart. It is really great that you people are coming up in such beautiful things to express about the Kundalini. Russians are special but in the whole world, it's very difficult to talk about the higher life. And they will never believe but you people have not only accepted but have assimilated and have grown into such beautiful higher life of Sahaja Yoga...

The whole world accepts for India I should say ... People from Russia and also Belarus, Ukraine and Tatarstan (Tartarstan we know a little bit of it because Changez Khan came from there to India).People from all over have come here. (Russia, Ukraine,& Belarus ) All of them have come here and it's so nice to see the unity & how you all have been really enjoying it and expressing it. It's a really, the heavens as they describe is here! No one can expect in these modern times, such a great thing to happen. I am very very proud of you all. And may God give you more strength, patience and peace to grow more. Every piece was so beautifully done and such a small girl who acted as the Kundalini knew everything by heart. I was surprised. It is all so different from what you see in this world...And such a solace, such a joy...May God Bless You.

These girls have to dance still. They all are ready here...If you allow them to dance, I am going to sit down till they finish. Only one or three, four I saw...
