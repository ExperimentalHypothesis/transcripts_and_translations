Talk in Stockwell, 1977-12-01

Shri Mataji: Again goes it down, again comes up, again goes down like that, you see, settles there like clouds, but sometimes when it pierces it with a force, then you get this kind of an experience, it’s a very, very exciting experience, I should say. (Shri Mataji is laughing.

Yogis: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: better, better be seated with some questions, because we’ll give him Realization to begin with. He’s the only one who has not got it, who else has come for the first time here?

Newcomer: My first time.

Shri Mataji:  'Who else. First of all let’s give them Realization, and then we will see, you come here, can you sit on the ground for a while?

Newcomer: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Alright, alright. Please sit. And who else?

She’s all right there, She (?) where do you stay. You see, they do a particular thing in a particular manner, to your Kundalini, and that any chakras. And what I have to do this to master the map of curing it , you see.

Every time I find a new Guru, now this time yours, this Guru Rajo is absolutely a new fellow, But I will manage that also.

Newcomer: Mataji, [he's] I’ve been doing good things to the chakras as well.

Shri Mataji: It’s terrible, it’s all wrong, absolutely wrong. What is wrong, I  tell you, very simple thing, that sex has nothing to do with God. Sex is not meant for achieving your higher needs, you know, that’s for baser things, not for higher things. Sex plays no part at all, on the contrary, you have to be an innocent person when you are coming for the (?union).

Because Kundalini is your own Mother, and you would not like to have anything to do with her, as far the sex is concern. It is absurd, it is perversion, and this is what it is. By doing all these things, they put sex on the Mother, She is the only Mother you have, and you are the only child She has, and She keeps on with you, through all, for days together, for years together, for ages together, in all your births She has been with you, and to insult Her like this, is too much. I mean, one of the greatest sins is, to do sex on Her, and that [that’s your kundalini] to Kundalini, which is the purest form of Mother.

Newcomer: I don’t understand the connection between, Guru Raj and sex.

Yogi: (unclear: Do you mean) Rajneesh.

Shri Mataji: absolutely ...

Newcomer: this is Guru Raj and ...[UNCLEAR: Ananda]

Yogini: But he also [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: ...with the heart.

Yogini: He also did the Mooladhara...it’s also wrong.

Shri Mataji: ... style, Guru Raj, yes, I see. But, Guru Raj also, the same. Now, this is the sex part, alright? Then the heart, you see? He says you give your heart towards the mandala, and things like that, but now, the thing is unless until you are connected, how can you do it? You see, if you try to say that – now, I tell you that you must telephone to someone, and the connection is not established, what are you doing then?

Newcomer: But the connection must be there to some extent ...

Shri Mataji: No, no, not at all, it is not at all, you see that mean [main] point, you must understand, the connection of God in a very different manner, you see. We are guided through Him and all that, because you are all saints that’s why, but you are given complete freedom to choose. You have to have a completely freedom, otherwise you do not choose. Choice in freedom, means, a complete freedom in the (?world).. Absolutely, you will be surprised. If you want you can hit yourself, if you want you can ask a boon to hit yourself, or if you want you can rise. So it is absolute freedom given to you. There is no, no, not at all! He doesn’t hold your hand anywhere, of course if you are a good man if you understand, if you are religious He guides you, He is there to help you, He will look after you, but He will not in any way give you a guidance that will hamper your freedom. No, you are free to choose, because He has to develop you. You see, like we are teaching somebody swimming, first you tell him – all right, – do a little bit like this, and then you just leave him at that time you have to leave completely.

In the same way, in the earliest ages when we were animals He were looking after us, He’s holding our hands, He’s taking us down and doing everything. But when we are human beings He says – now you try, otherwise you won’t be good swimmers. First you have to be good swimmers. So, complete freedom is giving to you. You see, complete, that’s what we do not understand! It's is so much complete that He cannot supersede our freedom, you know that? Supposing you don’t want to get Realization. I cannot give you. He cannot. Nobody can. Your freedom is respected. Your freedom is beyond. In this you are supreme, imagine, how He has placed you. So, you just tell Him, you have to get your Realization, and Realization you’ll get by your freedom, when you understand what is wisdom. Not to go to any extremes, You have to be so frank, the way we are frank. Come along, come along, come. Come along, there is a lot of space, come along. How are you? He is all the time now enjoy, I can see that clearly. Ha, very good.

So the freedom has to be understood, that it is bestowed upon us, because we are responsible, God thinks we are maturing enough, you are a good swimmer,[seeker] that’s why He gives us. And how has He to judge our maturity? It’s only by freedom, a complete freedom. So, when he (the false guru) says, that you take out your heart and put it on the mandala, you see, then what happens? You are doing it absolutely, – first of all he has no authority, He’s not authorised. And everybody’s heart you cannot (?), Kundalini is at the base here, Triangular bone, now, what the use of putting the hearts somewhere? When the Kundalini is standing there, what are you putting there? Kundalini, supposing the coil of the, the coil of this stage, it’s placed that side. Now what are you taking out from here? Maybe some (?other) instrument which will be required later on, it is absolutely mishandling of the instrument, completely.

Newcomer: What he says is happening. As you’re working on one particular block in the instrument.

Shri Mataji: (unclear: What's this?)

Newcomer: What he is saying is that to some extent, Kundalini must be flowing anywhere, [anyway] otherwise you wouldn't [be alive] have realized, there are certain blocks in some chakras ....

Shri Mataji: He doesn’t know, he doesn’t know, he doesn’t know. You can see for yourself that in a person who is not Realized, Kundalini is sleeping. He doesn’t know even the basic. He doesn’t know even the basic of Kundalini, She is sleeping just like a primula in a seed. Primula are never flowing, it is weak. Till that water of love comes to the Kundalini, till She is assured, She is not going to rise She is waiting for Her time, it is not all the time flowing, it’s a wrong, it’s a wrong idea, absolutely wrong, (?). And it’s written down in all the scriptures if he has read any scripture about Kundalini, it is said that She is a dormant being. She is lying there, absolutely sleeping in such sleeping conditions, in some of them, in his case, it is frozen. In his own case, it's frozen.

She might be, you see, when I saw his first photograph, I felt that he might have been a Realized soul, might have been, I felt that way. But the way you see, he is not such a good Realized person or anything, I think he became ambitious or something like that, without even going deep in to it, he started doing this work, and the Kundalini now is frozen, even a person, now you get Realization. I have got people who got Realization through Sahaja Yoga, some of them, but they went back to the hell. Yes, you can! If you have to go further on, then you have to know, that it is can only be done by going deep into it, understanding it, what is that, properly. I can put you to connection, alright. But I cannot keep it there, it can fall down. It can fall down. It falls in many people. Especially people who are coming from Gurus, you will yourself face it later on. When you’ll be working on people, you will find it. It falls down, then you will have to take it up and tie it . But only a Realized Soul can do it, nobody else, you see, now mandala also, the mantras also.

It’s a big science, and it’s a living science, do we understand the meaning of the word living science? We don’t understand. Living science means, a Kundalini supposing now it rises, in your case, supposing it has come up to the Agnya just now it’s in the Agnya but, it may fall down, possibly, it’s a living science, because it’s living, it has moved up to Agnya, but it’s going down all the time, means you have to stop it at Agnya, so I have to, – whatever mantra I have to do it’s (?) not of heart, wherever it is, it’s very simple thing to understand, supposing you have gone [a car], you are going in a car, now you are stuck up say in a, say in  Piccadilly. Let us take that. I know, very few names of (?). And then you are calling the police say from, from Western Square or some other place, then it’s wrong. You have to call in the people who are in the Piccadilly to help you out, they are not supposed to do this.

So, first of all you should know where is your Kundalini, that’s he does not know, he does not know how to raise it, all right, he does not know which chakra (?) ... hallo (to a newcomer)

Yogis: this is Martin, he has not been here before, he is a friend of ...

Shri Mataji: you see, this is the thing, you cannot just conceptualise it, you cannot make it programmed, no! It works on its own, wherever is a problem, it has come. Now for both of the cases is, right heart, left heart, moving on, is there. Now, just now the Kundalini is moving to that chakra and then it doesn’t move up, because it is spreading into these two places which are spoiled. You have removed the energy whatever was there to such an extent that there is a big, sort of  a need, for it to be alright, to be sustained, in  the centre heart.  So, the Kundalini moves there, because has to be sustained.

Could we have Martin over there, with that you are alright, you can put your hands like this, alright? While I am speaking it will work out. Then the Kundalini fills it, repairs it, and then it goes up. It’s like a river flowing, you know? If it finds there are ditches around, it fills the ditches on this side, the flow is less, then again after filling it then again another force comes though it, now in this hand the force is coming up, you see? Now, then it goes, and then it goes up, then it goes to Agnya, now it has moved to Agnya. From Agnya it spreads like this, it goes down again, feeds your sympathetic, but some people who have a very simple Kundalini, simple thing, now their Kundalini just shoots up, and they never even lose it. We have many people like that, just is there. never a problem! Never a problem. So we have styles, and styles and types, and types. But the only problem, you see, with these (?spirits) is, that they get, – look so much identified, that’s very difficult. You get identified with them, they don’t do any good to you, they spoil your Kundalini and you are identified with them, is such a troublesome thing for Me, to get you dis-identified, to make you understand that (?)

Now what should we expect, you see is the thing, we must know what we have to expect (?from the) Kundalini. Now all the scriptures, scriptures I say not any Dick, Tom and Harry writing about Kundalini, anybody like (?Avon,) has written such a big book, you know there is a book written by (?Mr. Avon ), such a big book, I never read it, but there is an ambassador who had read it, and he told Me, it’s most surprising that this gentleman has written that the Kundalini, you see, it starts from the centre and he said that it goes like this in the front side, you see, through this cervical plexus and all these plexuses outside in the gross.  

It’s a fundamental thing that it is in a subtler way, of course, as much as I know, no scriptures have yet described it. That’s for sure, I’m sorry, but it is, – into such details, into such way, nobody had described it. Of course part of it has been described, and all that, and from that at least you should remember one thing, that when the Kundalini rises, you should see the pulsation rising, dilatation of the pupil must take place, you go into thoughtless awareness, and then you jump, when you cross this point you get a softness there, and then you get the cool breeze, in the hands also you get the cool breeze. It is described by Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya! New ones are all bogus people, most of them are. (Shri Mataji is laughing) The less [said] the better. She was telling Me one of them is a smuggler, so you can imagine what sort of Shankaracharya as we are getting nowadays.

So, this is how they are. So, what do we expect is, at collective consciousness that is what they have to achieve. Samuhik chaitanya. Now the thing is, even – I mean, if you read scriptures like Bible, in that also you will see that the description of the Kundalini is giving by secretive manner, but is very clear, for example, they say ‘I will appear before you like tongues of flames.’ That’s the Kundalini. Then Christ said, somebody touched Him, that ‘my energy has passed into that person.’ It’s a clear-cut thing, absolutely clear-cut, and the one who has authority, despite that I would say, one who, which he will not understand why it’s happening but, gradually will know. But even the, I have seen very great saints, like Gagangiri Maharaj he cannot give Realization the way you can give, he takes at least 5 to 6 years, for one person, he works, and now he is fed up, he said – ‘now I’m not going to work.’ He worked on one person for 25 years. I asked his stories, He said (?now I’ll put everything on a tape). And he said that ‘this fellow, I’m now fed up, now I’m not going to give Realization to anybody, You are a Mother you go on and give.... (realization?) You are the Power You can do it, but I’m not going to give.’I said, “Why, what happened”? He was very angry with that fellow. He said, ‘You see I gave him 25 years of my precious life, I gave him (?), one by one every Kundalini I raised it, I cleared him, I did everything, and now he has become fond of women and money, and he’s (going down?) This fellow, I happened to meet once, one of my disciples, she had invited him, (?) and she said Mataji he's coming, he would like to come. I said, why he would (?like to come? Let’s see).

He was sitting before Me like this, smoking, and all that. And, (?) of course, he came up and he touched My Feet, (?) because he knows who I am, so it's alright, Then I said (?) I was just (?keeping, and he was talking like this very great) And he tells Me that- ‘ Now, you see my Guru has lost all his powers.’ I said why? He’s coming to Bombay and I asked him –  Why are you coming to Bombay? And he said, ‘I must, see, Mataji is coming, so I must come and see Her. He said – You know, now he wants to come to the city, and ... I said, Why are you here? And I said – Why do you say anything against your Guru? You shouldn’t say, because you know he is a very great Soul and has worked on you for 25 years, and you talk ill about him. You should not have done! So he said, no, no, because you know, he was like this, and he was like that, he was telling Me.

So I played My tricks on him, – I said alright, now I’m going away, so I will put some tikka on you, so I put tikka on his (? forehead), then I said now you can put some on Me, as soon as he put his hand here, I sucked it, you see, he couldn’t (?take it back) He said, ‘Mataji, what are You doing?’ The whole body started shaking, I said, now please promise that you will not say a word against your Guru, because he is a great (?man). He is John the Baptist, born again, About him, I’m telling you.

Shri Mataji: (towards somebody who just come in). Hello, come along!And about him, he was telling, so he said that, – now I’m not, for 12 years I’m going to be (?) ... and when my Sahaja yogis went there, he said, – ‘how many people, ... you raised your hands, how many are going to give their lives for Mataji?’Like that, he was talking.

Yogini: I feel so sorry...

Shri Mataji: it’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright.

Yogini: be careful ...

Shri Mataji: what did you say?

Yogini: be careful with this table...

Shri Mataji: I could make, you see, I had never seen (?) newer I see one. ... I have not seen many of them, actually they know about Me, and they talk about Me, somebody goes there abroad, [in] Himalayas, also somebody told about Me, but I don’t know, who are they, but if I meet their disciples I know that this fellow has got (?) , because their Kundalini are not disturbed. First thing, they will never disturb the Kundalini because they know it’s the greatest thing.

Newcomer: Mataji, it's terribly confusing...

Shri Mataji: but one thing I’ll tell you... what’s your name you say?

Newcomer: my name is Robert.

Shri Mataji: Robert. Now Robert, I’ll tell you one thing, Kundalini you cannot understand through your brain, alright? Firstly. Let it happen, let it happen, that’s the thing you are born for, to get it from Me. You cannot rationalize it, it’s confused, because you cannot understand something unlimited through a limited brain, that is your brain.

Robert: that is easy to accept, in one sense that ...

Shri Mataji: but let it happen, let it happen, you just let it happen, you just allow yourself to be that [there], alright, let it happen. Because that’s very important, the more you cooperate with Me, the better it will be. Is just to allow. Tell your mind, you have led me nowhere, now keep quiet for a while. It’s a horse, you know, it’s a horse and a naughty one, it knows its master, if you allow me to eat grass, it will eat grass, but if you tell him, now, please be careful and alert, I have to go, I have to go ahead (?). Just tell him, behave itself, and it will be alright. The mind is a very tricky monkey, (?) so, now, don’t play in the hands of the monkey, because it has led you nowhere. Just, now, you listen, it will work out, and once it works out then you tell Me, Vincent was much worse than you. (Shri Mataji is laughing) He argued with Me for how many days? I think two days or something like that, (at length?) you know, and now he is alright, (?) So, I want you to share back, [I wanted to share that] all right?

Shri Mataji: Ha, so, how is it? It’s left out.

Yogini: Mm, enrooted.

Shri Mataji: Apart from that, did you do Hatha yoga, and all that?

Newcomer: I did TM for about four years.

Shri Mataji: TM?

Newcomer: Now I reach at the 4 years. [Maharishi for four years.]

Yogini: (inaudible. Left Vishuddhi.)

Shri Mataji: you keep your eyes open, alright? You cannot close your eyes before Me, if you try to close them, they will go on like that. All of them had the same problem, you can ask Ingrid, she will tell you. She had the same problems, her eyes used to be like this. Now are you alright Ingrid?

Nothing upsetting now, we managed it. I must say, I’m so very happy, it will be a big news in India, because not one person from that horrible TM I could give Realization, only one person we gave and, he is after all, the artist all the musicians, and all the big businesspeople and bureaucrats.

Yogini: left Swadhishthana is ...

Shri Mataji: Are you an artist?

Newcomer: no, I’m an actor.

Shri Mataji: actor.  Are you better? In a way? Just see him, he will get the fastest, before all of them, because he has not yet been to any Gurus. (Shri Mataji is laughing) Is he alright?

Newcomer 2: I think he just got the same problem as me.

Shri Mataji: A yes, that’s why, that’s why.

Robert: Shri Mataji, why did you say ’that horrible TM’, I did TM for eight years, and I enjoyed it so much.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s the thing, you see, one enjoys even drinking very much, but I have to say it’s horrible, It’s like drinking (?), you see? Turn around, turn around.  It’s like drinking, you will see that, but now you will say the same thing, when you will get somebody coming from TM, you will say no, no I’m not going to put my hands towards him, (Shri Mataji is laughing) You will get burned, just ask her, do like this, burning, hands coming this thing, look at their faces, you see that. All kinds of terrible acting is going on there. Ha.

Yogini: so strong ...

Shri Mataji: Deep, very deep.

Yogi: He gets asthma too.

Shri Mataji: Hm?

Yogi: he gets asthma.

Shri Mataji: (?) is it? Now, will you hold your breath, could you hold your breath? Put both hands under My Feet, hold your breath, let’s see.

Yogis are laughing....

Shri Mataji: what happened?

Yogis: Shri Mataji we got a gift in the bag...laughing...lovely, this is beautiful, come on...

Shri Mataji: oh, God! (?) Thank you, thank you very much!! May God bless you! Thank you!How are your ... visitors?

Yogis: laughing...

Shri Mataji: hold your breath,

Yogi: nice.

Shri Mataji: Nice you have to be, alright? Now I already (?tied) Now?Yogini: Better is yes,Shri Mataji: now you can give up your breath...Shri Mataji: Now, give it up, now better?Yogis: much better, it should be [vishuddhi] he smokes so...

Shri Mataji: you smoke?

Somebody: and sings

Shri Mataji: and sings, then got asthma. that’s all, not much.(Shri Mataji addressing to someone else) He came to my lecture? (?)

Newcomer three: I’ve just come...[UNCLEAR] ... seriously

Shri Mataji: how did you come?

Newcomer three: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] ... what happened, then what happened?

Newcomer three: I came on the underground.

Shri Mataji: underground, and how did you come here? Somebody told you about Me?

Newcomer three: (unclear...? A Pick Quick ...

Yogini: Ah, a Pick Quick a music ... laughing

Shri Mataji explains about the subtle system: (unclear) So, lots of areas left here and lots of areas left there. Little area left there, and little area left (?) Now, down below, the area left, say is the hell. But it has got seven strata’s, the hell exists, absolutely! It is [And] very well described by Mahavira, who was a contemporary of Buddha. He has described it very clearly, what sort of a thing is the hell! I would not like to describe it, because it’s so terrible, it’s so filth, it’s so dangerous, it’s so violent, it’s terrible! And when they say that people go to hell, really they do, no doubt. It’s an existence, which is worse than that of a stone we can say, but a stone at least is not aware, but here you are aware of it. Now you think of yourself as you are, with your awareness of a human awareness, and if you are made to live in a gutter. But this is nothing. This is nothing than what hell is. If you are made to lie inside with your head. going into the gutter, it is nothing that I’m describing, nothing, it’s thousand times worse than that.

Then there are seven strata’s, in which there is different, different types of hell, One is worse than the other. It is like a reformative school of very intensive style, a certain intensive thing it is, that you cannot imagine, what sort of a thing it could be. So, but when people talked of hell, actually, they wanted to frighten people also, and tell them, that if you do this thing you will go to hell, but instead of getting frightened, what happened, people started using it, as a sort of a,- you can call it as sort of a propaganda, that if you come to the church or if you go to the a temple, or if you do this, you will be saved from the hell, and by that you said – now you give them ten rupes, or ten pounds, then you will be saved from hell. So, you know they definitely did it. It’s a very, very cunning way. You create a picture of something horrid, and tell them that if you don’t do it, if you don’t do a particular thing then you go to that (?) , or [its] something like that, and that’s how, hell became a myth for us, because we thought that those who are teaching us are worse than us, so people did not believe in it, but it exists, it’s a reality. Why? I don’t know what is the human idea of heaven is. There are three sides I have told (?), on the right-hand side, left-hand side and the top. Those who are on the right-hand side, are the Gods as I called them, are the supra-conscious people, are all the five elements, like you know all the five elements, they are guarded by a particular deity. You all have deities, and these are you can call them gods, and then there are chiran jivas, – eternal beings, they all exist on the right-hand side, and there are other types of – Ashwathavas, and all those they are of animals forms, they also exist, all of them are there, for what? To guide you to the proper life, angels, like Gabriel, is the head of the angels of the right-hand side.

On the left-hand side, Michael, Saint Michael, is the angel. I mean He is the chief angel on the left-hand side, who looks after you, He is within you, He looks after you, that He does not allow you to go to the subconscious mind too much.

For example, you are thinking about your past, you are crying too much, or start going deep down, deep down, then He stops you, He saves you from that. But still you deny, still you deny, you enjoy, you see, all those things, so, then he says alright go, so then you start moving towards the left. When you go beyond that, in the area, which is supposed to be the void sort of thing in there, you are sucked into the hell. So, going to the extremes of things, on both the sides, you go to hell, alright? Some goes straight, you don’t have to go sideways.

Yogis: are laughing

Shri Mataji: (Shri Mataji is laughing) Now, Sahaja yogis come up to the super-ego here, super-conscious mind, here, this also has got seven stratas. So you have seven here, seven there, seven there, and seven on top. Now you may ask Me, why seven? You should. Now you know there is a coefficient of seven. 22 upon seven (22/seven), have you seen that?  The circumference over diameter is equal to 22 upon seven. (? Is, And) the ratio all the time goes (?up and down). So, when I say that is the radius, – if say, – three and a half, half of the seven, then the circumference is (?11) alright? So, you have got three and a half Kundalini, Kundalini is three and half sitting in the Mooladhara chakra and when it opens out it goes up to the radius point, alright? So it completes to the end, when it rises fully, it goes to the radius point. Now see, three and the half, three and the half, you can say like the, – that three and half are the seven chakras, while the first three are divided into two, and the seventh one is there, but they go into 11, I mean 11 into X, whatever it is, eleven, one, two, three, like 11, These 11 circumference points are very important for us, in this 11 things we are work, 11 guards, they are called as Rudras, and they are placed in your forehead, and they are 11 real aspects of Christ, which I’ve described very well in My book, when it will come. So, there are 11 aspects (you should remember that?) – you should read sometimes My chakras to them. There are 11 aspects, 11 Rudras. When the destruction time finally will come, these 11 will act and destroy the whole thing. So, these are the 11. That’s why number is a very auspicious one, so if you have to give something to someone, give it by 11. 11 rupes, 11 pounds, 11 is a good number, because 11 is a complete half circle. The lower circle you don’t have to worry, that’s why it is three and half, Kundalini, has to go up, you understand? That’s why this three and half in ratio, so now, did you understand now, the mathematics? Still, you could not...(?)  

Shri Mataji: (? I must) tell you mathematics. In ratio to half a circle, in which you have to rise to the top, the radius has to be three and a half, and this is 11.Shri Mataji: why?

Newcomer: I don’t mind; because [but] I don’t understand.

Shri Mataji: you see,

Another Newcomer: is this that (?) 3.142 , that’s 22 upon seven.

Shri Mataji: 22 upon seven, alright? Make it half, alright, make it half, what is 11 upon three and a half, alright, correct? Eleven upon three and a half, you have to only worry for the upper side of it. So you have to worry only about the half circle, not about the lower circle. So when we have to worry, the Kundalini has to give light to the half circle which is higher, not to the lower circle, so it is three and a half, in three and a half coils, that is in relation absolutely to the 11 parts of this aura. So, the Kundalini enlightens those 11 parts which are in the circumference.

Now, do you understand, Mr. mathematician? What is the ratio between the radius and the half circle?

Newcomer: I just don’t know why you called 11 out that area there?Yogis: [UNCLEAR].... 22... is the circumference of the circle...

Shri Mataji: You see, the 22 and the half, is for the whole circumference. But we only have to worry the half circumference, which is the upper side of it. We don’t have to worry about the hell and about Supra-conscious and about, you see that part.

Newcomer: Now, I understand.

Shri Mataji: Now, you understand?

Newcomer: Yes, I understand.

Shri Mataji: He is the greatest mathematician sitting here Now, what am I to do with these mathematicians, you tell me? A very simple thing is it.

In the supra-conscious mind, on the right-hand side,- you are also a mathematician?On right-hand side is the supra-conscious, alright? The half circle supra-conscious, and the half circle sub-conscious is alright, in the sense that you can work on them, but you don’t have to worry about them. You cannot go there, and you cannot achieve Realization, but lower side on both the things are wrong. They go towards the hell, those people who have tried before to go in the right side, by renouncing, by abstaining, and doing all kinds of things, and by loving everything put together, they most of them go to the right-hand side because the left-hand side is a very serious matter. Only some of the people, who are great Shiva Bhakta’s, who are the worshippers of Shiva can go on left-hand side with the help of Shiva, and very few people have gone there, and once they have gone that side, they are settled in the state of Chiranjivas means – eternal beings, they do not vanish [perish], their bodies remain, they are everywhere. So, there are two types of heavenly people you can say. But, you are not that, you are human beings, alright, to begin with. And you have to come on top of it, like you can say, that there is a drama going on. Then in a drama you have got many actors who have to play the role, and there are on the stage lots of lights coming in, lots of people organizing it. The platform is arranged. The stage is arranged. The lights are arranged. The focusing is done, that’s done by others, but you are on the stage, alright? In the same way, you are on the stage now. Sahaja yogis are, and all these people are just there to help. You are not to become them, you are made for a different purpose. You are not made for that purpose. So, you don’t try to do these things. What you have to do is to become absolutely Realized, to go higher and higher in your awareness. So what is the second stage of awareness? Now you have got thoughtless awareness, means you can become thoughtless, there is no thought in your mind, once you become this, thoughtlessly aware, what happens to you, is the vibrations start flowing, which means that now you have crossed this limit, and you have come up.

But what is the second stage? The second stage is doubtless awareness. At this stage you will be surprised, that you start giving Realization to people. It’s very easy for you, so many of (them?) are there at this stage, but in doubtless awareness still you have to go deep, in which you do not catch from people at all. Whatever people may be suffering, you just don’t catch, you don’t feel anything about it, that stage comes in, and that’s you should call as a complete Self Realization. In which sitting down here, you can give Realization to people, not Realization, but you can give them awakening, sitting down here you can cure people. Once, who it comes to your attention, you can work it out.

Beyond that, is the state of what you call, the God’s Realization, God’s Realization. In that, you start controlling both the stages, of supra-conscious and sub-conscious, everything. You control the whole atmosphere, you can control the elements, you can control the rain, you can do all these things. But this is no good, I mean, there is no need to bother about these, nothing important, you just automatically do it.

What is important is to cross even this. So, you reach the stage now, after this, you reach a stage where there is a gap, (?where) you knew an [a new incarnation] incarnation. Incarnations are always above there is a gap, This gap had been crossed only by two people, Buddha and Mahavira, to became Hassan and Hussain. They were the only who could cross, but they were born of incarnations, they were the children of incarnations, they were human beings, just see, if God wants, He can do anything He likes. So, He created two incarnations of Luv and Kush. They were the children of Rama and Sita. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahavira, and then Hasan and Hussein. So, these are the only two human beings, actually who were the children of an incarnation became incarnations, and they are placed in the body of the Virata, in the centre point here, helping, give Realization and Salvation.

Now, there is a difference between a Devata and Devas, this you must understand very clearly. Devatas are the Deities who help the Salvation, who play a direct part in the Salvation. And the Devas are the people, as I told you, those Chiranjivas, all those Gods and Goddesses, and all that. There is a God called as Indra, in Greek, what do you call him? Zeus. Indra is Zeus, is here like that, so we those Gods and Goddesses, somebody controlling the thunder, somebody controlling this, controlling that. All these, all these Gods and Goddesses is not what you are going to be. You are not made for that. What you are going to become, (Shri Mataji is laughing) ... and that’s not your job! What’s your job is, to give Realization, you are going to be the instruments of Salvation. First you have your Salvation, and then you give Salvation to others, That is the way it is going to work out. And once you start giving Salvation, lots of beautiful people are going to come on to this earth to help you. So, this is the (last era?) tune together to do. Now, this is the work of the central path, as I have told you, is of the central path. Central path is the Mahalakshmi one, on which the Vishnu resides, Who is the Evolutionary Deity. This Evolutionary Deity allows you to evolve. So, when He becomes completely evolved, in the complete, then He is Virat, He is the Vast. That is the aspect of God, and who others have them, is the Son God, and who else? It is the Primordial Mother, Who is the Holy Ghost. (Shri Mataji is laughing) Do you understand? This is the thing. Isn’t it?

Shri Mataji is addressing to a child: Will you have this, do you like it? They like all of them very much, that’s a sign. Now, anymore, questions?

Newcomer: what will be like in the future, when the so...[UNCLEAR when this has all worked out]  

Shri Mataji: in a Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to think about future at all, you have to be at the present moment. Now you start thinking about the future, say. How can we think about the future, because future doesn’t exist, it’s a myth! What exists is the present. You don’t have to bother about what is going to happen in the future, because I don’t want to fix your attention there, what will happen, you will give up this work, and then you’ll say, – oh, that Mataji has promised, that’s going to come. No. If you work now at the present, the future will be done. So, you have to worry about the present. Now, future thinking is absurd, I tell you. Why?

Now, Sahaja Yoga, you have seen is a living thing, it works out in a living way. You cannot say whether you will give her Realization or not, can you? Tell Me now, (?) can you? You cannot. Now, you cannot say, if you bring your son here or your brother here or your father here. Are you sure that you can give them Realization? If you plant a tree, can you say that l definitely it will give you fruits? Or even if it gives you fruits, can you say at what time it will give you fruits? At the most what you can say is, that it is a mango tree, it will give a mango.

So you are human being. If you are Realized, you will become a Sahaja yogi, that’s all.Now, if you become a Sahaja yogi, then live in the present. Now what do you do by becoming in the present, what do you do?

You are channels, God has made you a channel, He’s using you. So, why He does, He uses you as channel to work out these things. So, what you do, you watch, be on the watch, what’s happening, what’s happening, this happens, you will be amazed!

Now, I’ll ask Gordon to give his experience, like you ...[told Me] this one, together... this up... Hm.
