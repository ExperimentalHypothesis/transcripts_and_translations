Public Program, Paris Gaveau, France. 24 July 1992.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot think about it, we cannot conceptualize it. Unfortunately at this human level we cannot feel it, we cannot know it. We have to be the Spirit to know the truth.


Whatever I am going to tell you today you have not to believe blindfolded. But as scientists, keep your mind open and treat this as a hypothesis. In case it is proved then as honest people you have to accept it because it is for your benevolence, it is for the benevolence of your country and it is for the benevolence of the whole world. All world problems are due to human beings and all human problems are due to these subtle centers which are within you. When these centers get blocked, then you have physical, mental, emotional as well as spiritual problems. 


But all of you, believe Me, were born with a innate faith of divinity within you. This innate faith within you was there but it was challenged later on and you got confused. This challenge could have come from various sources. One of them, surprisingly, is coming from religion. Many people who have come to Sahaja Yoga have told Me that they were very much disappointed in their religions because these religions are money-oriented or power-oriented. They are not spirit-oriented. The second challenge comes to you from science. Science is something which is not conclusive, nor it is a solution of totality. It does not talk of your ascent. It does not talk of higher life. 


So from religion if you turn to science and say that we do not believe in God, we believe in science, it is not going to take you to reality because science also moves in a linear direction and after some time it cannot sustain itself because there is no reality and it is coiling back, and coiling back or boomerangs on you. Specially in the West in the modern times they have produced lots of intellectuals like Freud. Last 22 years I have been telling that he is a hocus pocus and don't believe his theories, it has no scientific basis. Now there is a very good book written by a very well-known expert doctor who says the same thing and he has clearly shown how Freud has ruined the culture and the thought of Americans, I think of the whole world. So when people following say, a religion like Catholic religion, who lived with funny ideas of original sin could not bear it any more because it was so unnatural, so they fell for thing like Freud very fast. 


William Blake, a great poet from England, has said that this idea of original sin has been invented by some devil. According to this, everybody and every incarnation like Shri Krishna, Shri Rama, Mohammed Sahib, Nanak Sahib, Lao Tse, everybody is a sinner. Such an absurd thing that was put forward and because it was a very dominating religion, was the official religion behaving like a juridical king, people had to accept. Those people who did not believe in it were boiled, were roasted in the huts. In the name of religions, how many people have killed? Not only Catholics, all types have been killed in the name of God.  And in modern times they are all busy collecting money somehow. They are cavorting with the politicians, or with the kings, not with the saints. The original sin was such a ridiculous idea that they discussed the Immaculate Conception of Mary for generations. They wanted to find out Her virginity and the virginity of all Her ancestors. That shows they had no idea of God. He is God Almighty. He can do anything. Nothing is impossible for Him. It's an absurd thing to sit down and discuss about God when you have no connection with reality. This is how they are all preparing for hell for themselves. It is easy to talk like this but you must remember, it's a wrathful God.


While Mohammed Sahib has talked so much about Mary, not even in the Bible they have not talked, they have just called Her a woman. Even the idea of Madonna has come from the pagan religion, it's not mentioned in the Bible. Khalil Gibran has said that, "I don't know what is this Paul is there in the Bible; what is he doing?"  He has written a complete chapter about this Paul. I Myself was surprised, I was born myself in a Christian family, to see this gentleman Mr Paul in the Bible so prominent. He, he was not the disciple of Christ. He killed a very great disciple of Christ, Stephen, and he was a epileptic fellow. We have proved in Sahaja Yoga epilepsy comes to people who are possessed and he was very clever because what he did very nicely is to select the worst disciple of Christ. Christ has told Peter that Satan will take over, that means, supposing among the Sahaja Yogis who's the worst Sahaja Yogi, will you give him the key of the church?


Mr Paul thought it was a good platform to come on to and to manage all the people and put all the blame on the Jews and he got hold of this weakest disciple of Christ, Peter, and completely changed the essence of Christ's life and we are slavishly, blindfoldedly are not understanding that Christ's life was for salvation, not for killing people, not for destroying but for giving them salvation He came on this earth. But there is no talk of salvation, no words to talk of ascent. It's not only in Christianity but in every religion this is the situation. One has to remember very clearly that these are special times. Modern times are called as Kali Yuga in Sanskrit and it will be followed by Satya Yuga, means the Age of Truth.  But in between these two eras is called as the Krita Yuga. It's a very special one. In this Yuga, the all-pervading power of God's divinity is acting and it is said that everybody will get their karma phal, means their awards for what good or bad they have done. Paul has described it as polarity. If you do something wrong to someone it reacts on you and at this time it is well to work out because this is the time of Last Judgment. All these false people, false gurus are there for you to judge who is the real and who is not. The falsehood will be exposed, but those who will still identify themselves with falsehood, will be punished. The only solution is to ascend, to get over it. Those who want to ascend, this divine power is the ocean of compassion and love. Not with the people who are identified with false things like fundamentalism: that is how you separate people from one to another. That is how you are fighting with each other in the name of God.


It is time for all of us to awaken and to introspect. We have already wasted a lot of our time on nonsensical things. When are we going to understand what is reality? In the name of self-knowledge so much nonsense has been done, even by intellectuals, as if a kind of slavery which is brainwashing us all the time. To add to it we have entrepreneurs, especially in Paris. They said last year they decided to have six inches of skirts for ladies, six inches, and everywhere you cannot get longer skirts, you have to wear six inches only, you have to buy only six inches. All longer skirts are thrown away and now six inches they are buying. In the cold, in the wintry time they are buying these six inches of skirts. I just don't know what has happened to their brains. Have they no intelligence of their own? Have they no personality of their own that they take to all kinds of nonsensical things without even thinking how destructive it is?


He was, Paul was, a hater of women. He never respected them. But now in Greece, in Greece, Athena is the primordial Mother. They talked of God Almighty, and His Son and no Mother. Mother is missing, She is a dove, not in Greece, in Greece Athena is the primordial Mother. In India She is the Adi Shakti, also in England She was the white Goddess. She was, she was not mentioned as Madonna but as a woman. Big controversies. Madonna is accepted by people who are faithful, they could feel.


Now this Kundalini that you have within you is the reflection of that primordial Mother, and the Spirit is in our heart, is the reflection of God Almighty. You have to have the actualization of self-realization. Sermons and lectures and all that we have had enough of it. Now the time has come for you to ascend and to achieve reality. The truth is, first one, that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings or ego but you are pure Spirit. And the second truth is that there is a all-pervading power of Divine love which works out all the living work. You see beautiful flowers? You take them for granted. What a miracle! Look at our eyes. What a miracle, what a camera! Look at our brain. What a computer it is! Who runs our heart? Who runs our heart? They say it is the autonomous nervous system. Who is this auto? We take everything for granted.


So the second truth is that there is a divine power of love which does all these things and that power has become now very powerful in the sense that it has become acting now, it is acting because also this is the Last Judgment. It's nonsense to say that when you will die you will be called and you'll be judged. Dead bodies are not going to be judged. How can you believe these things? Only you will be judged when you are living. Mohammed Sahib has said clearly that, "When the resurrection time will come your hands will speak." This is exactly what Sahaja Yoga is. They want to call a sect, Sahaja Yoga. Sect means, in English language, I don't know French, but in English language, it means that you separate, that one body gets out of another body but in Sahaja Yoga we have the synthesis of all the religions. We believe in all the religions, in all the races, in all the nations. We have so many Jews who worship Christ, and we have so many Hindus who worship Mohammed. 


It is impossible to understand how you can find faults with something which is absolute falsehood. Christ has said one thing which is very important. "The meek in the heart will inherit the earth", meek in the heart, humble, humble in the heart will inherit the earth. Now who are meek? Anglo Saxons? Who are meek people? That's a good idea. If you think you are meek, then please try to understand I have met them. They live in places where are developing countries. They live in the countries like Bulgaria, Romania, in Poland, even in Russia. They live in South America. They are humble people, they are not arrogant. They do not think that, "We are the best, we are the grand people," no, and there where Sahaja Yoga is working the best because in Sahaja Yoga we do not take any money, but in the countries all kinds of false gurus, all kinds of false religions are prospering because you think you can purchase God, you can purchase ascent and a seat in the Heaven by paying money. 


Only the people who are humble in heart will inherit the earth. This arrogance is not going to help and this kind of domination also is not going to help. Is the humility to achieve the ascent. Ascent is not meant for arrogant people at all. When arrogant people will face God, He'll say, "Your place is not here." Their place is not at the Lotus feet of God Almighty. Look at Jesus Himself. What a humble man He was and He said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." I would like to see how many Christians have those innocent eyes. I'm here to assure you, whatever you have done, whatever has gone wrong with you, you shouldn't worry. All your divinity, all your blessing is within yourself, is absolutely safe. It is of eternal value, nothing can destroy it, whatever you might have tried. It's all within you, this power is within you, this mechanism is within you and you are the one who are going to ascend. 


Nothing is destroyed within you. You don't have to confess anything because these are eternal things built within you by God Almighty and you are going to get your reward. Have faith in yourself but, as I said, you have to be humble and you have to have pure desire to ascend. After you get your self-realization, the manifestation of Spirit is a miracle. First of all you get a power to give realizations to others. You become a real saint, you can cure people. You become virtuous, righteous automatically. I don't have to tell you because you are so beautiful within.  This Kundalini is your own Mother, individual Mother. When She ascends, She cleanses you completely and all your goodness start coming in a very victorious way. 


Now Sahaja Yoga is working in 55 countries and it is surprising how some people have understood the divine laws so well, because it is innate within us. All these centers, once they are innately awakened and nourished, you become a very different person, absolutely free from all weaknesses as human beings. I have seen people have given up drugs overnight. So many things have happened that I call Sahaja yogis as angels. Of course, we have had very few funny people also and we had to ask them to get out. We don't want to force anybody because Sahaja Yoga is what you say, whatever is your precept has to be the practice. It's not like this that you call yourself Hindu, Muslim, Christian and all kinds of things and you all can commit any sin. You have brothers and sisters waiting for you. You have to enter into that realm which is the kingdom of God. It is for you to achieve it, to get it.


In this short time, I'm sorry I won't be able to tell you all about Sahaja Yoga. When you come in this room you have to just switch on one light and everything works out because it is built in. In the same way it is built in within you. So what's the use of talking about the theories and things? Better actualize it, better get your enlightenment that you deserve. Sahaja Yoga is not meant for people who do not want their salvation. It's meant for people who really want their salvation. There is no fees for it, there's no payment, there's no effort. You do not have to starve and fast and go to Himalayas to stand on your heads. You have every right to get it here on your chairs. Please believe Me, all of you can get your self-realization. But those who do not want, we respect their freedom. They should leave the hall and be civil to others. It will take hardly 10 to 15 minutes, so just desire that you want your salvation. This is something that will happen tonight, but you must know that it is a collective happening. You cannot say that, "I'm practicing it at home." You have to be in the collective like a drop becomes the ocean, the microcosm becomes a macrocosm, like this finger is hurt the whole body feels it. In the same way everywhere there's a Sahaja yogi is part and parcel of the whole. If you want to know the reality, you have to become the Spirit. There is no other way. 


Now those who do not want should leave the hall, please. Will all the people who are standing, sit down, you can come and sit here also. Come in front, please, anywhere. You can come here also. Oh, better take the dog out, whose dog is this? Better be seated. He'll be in meditation also! (Yogi: The lady is blind.) Ah? (Yogi: The lady is blind.) All right. Also those who are standing there, please come. Some Sahaja Yogis are standing there. I think some of them are Sahaja Yogis. Please be seated. I'm sorry the hall is rather small. You could come up here, some of you can come up here. There's a lot of space. Good. I'm very happy. That's very nice. Anybody who can say, God bless you. Anybody, you can come from the other side. So many seekers of truth. 


I must tell you that there are three conditions which are very simple. The first one is that you all have to have complete confidence in yourself that you all will get your self-realization tonight. The second one is that you should not feel guilty about anything. After all, you are human beings. Only human beings can commit such mistakes. You are not Gods. What God can do is to forgive and He is the ocean of forgiveness. If you are seeking your ascent, He forgives everything that you call as mistakes. That means that you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourselves. I must say that when I first came to France, they told Me, "Mother, You are such a joyous person. But French don't like it. They think you are ignoramus." So I started my lecture with Les Misérables. So now forget those imaginary miseries. And the third very important but simple condition is that you have to forgive each and every person. Many of you would say that it's very difficult. But it's logical [illogical?]. If you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. 


Now the center at your optic chiasma in your brain is like this, absolutely constructed like this, and if you don't forgive, it won't open and you'll miss the chance of self-realization. First you have tortured yourself and now you want to miss out. But if you forgive, it opens like this, so nicely. So please believe Me, just with your heart, you've just to say, "I forgive everyone of them." Don't even think about them because that's a headache. In general you should say, "I forgive everyone." Immediately you feel lighter. Now if these conditions, if you follow, it will be very much easier for you to ascend. 


All right, now those who are sitting on the chairs or sitting on the ground, all of you have to take out your shoes because this Mother Earth is very helpful to us. All of you. Just help the gentleman, he needs. Just help him. He's taking out his shoes. Those who are sitting on the chair, sitting on the ground they're all right, have to put both their feet apart from each other, but those who are sitting on the ground are all right because the left and the right represent sympathetic, two sympathetic nervous systems, left and right. Left side represents the power of desire, ordinary desire and the right side the power of action. So first please put your left hand towards Me very comfortably on your lap. Sit comfortably, comfortably, the Shavasana. You do asanas? Shavasana is spread out, comfortably spread out. Now put all right. This is symbolic that you want your self-realization, is your desire. With the right hand only today you have to do nourishment of your centers yourself. 


So please put your right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the Spirit and if you are the Spirit, you are your master, your guide. So then you put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. We work only on the left-hand side. Now this is the center of your mastery created by great prophets. Now, then you have to take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge. Again you raise the hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Then you raise your hand again on your heart. Now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. This is the center gets into trouble when you feel guilty and then you develop diseases like spondylitis, like angina and lethargic hormones. Now please take your right hand on your forehead across and put down your head as far as possible. This is the center for forgiving others. Now take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine power.

	
Now, last center, very important. Stretch your palm fully, push back your fingers, and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers. That's very important. So there's a good pressure on your scalp. Now you have to move your scalp slowly six, seven times, clockwise. That's all you'll have to do. 


Now we start by loosening, if there's anything tight on your neck or on your waist, can loosen a little. In short, you have to be comfortable, but you should not bend nor should push back too much but sit straight. So now we start our journey. Please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you. 


Now put your left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart. Now you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself three times. You may call Me 'Mother' or 'Shri Mataji'. So please ask three times in your heart, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Loudly. As I told you, if you are the Spirit, you are your guide, your master. So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and here please ask Me another question: "Mother, am I my own master?" Three times. All right. I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I can not force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and here you have to say six times because this center has got six petals, six times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, this power of Kundalini starts rising. You will not feel anything till it reaches and pierces through the last center. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and here with full confidence you have to say 10 times, "Mother, am I my own master?" I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this egos, but you are the pure Spirit. (To translator: Loudly, you have to speak otherwise they can't hear you talk.) 


So now please raise your hand on your heart again and here you have to say it with full confidence, 12 times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit." This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of compassion and bliss, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness. So completely forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your right hand, head to your right side. Turn to your right. Here now you have to say 16 times with full confidence, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." 16 times. Now I've already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. At this time if you don't forgive, your Agnya chakra won't open, your center won't open. 


So now raise your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head as far as possible. Put it down on top of your forehead. Now here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."  Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head and without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, push back your head. For your own satisfaction, you have to say, "O, Divine power, if I have done something wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me." It's from heart, not how many times, from your heart. Now last center. Stretch your palm fully. Put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area which is a soft bone in your childhood. Now here put down your head. Put it on your head. Put down your head. Again, I respect your freedom and I cannot force self-realization on you. Push back your fingers, push back your fingers and here now you move your scalp seven times clockwise, saying, "Mother, please give me self-realization." Put down, put down your head. 


(Mother blows into the microphone seven times.)
 

Now please take down your hands. Please put both the hands towards Me. Please put the right hand towards Me. Bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool or a hot air, like breeze coming from your fontanel bone area. See with your left hand. Please don't put your hand on top of your head and don't doubt it. It's not air-conditioning from your head coming out. Now please put left hand towards Me and again bend your head and see for yourself if there's a hot or a cool breeze coming out of your head. Some people get it far away. Don't put your hand on the head but little away. Now if you have still not really forgiven it will be hot coming out. Now please put your right hand again once for all and now put down your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head, or a hot breeze.


Bend your head, bend. Now raise both your hands, put them up like this, and push back your head. Here you can ask any one of these three questions three times, firstly "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" or, "Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God's love?" or, "Mother, is it Paramchaitanya?" Any one of these questions you can ask three times. 


Now take down your hands, please. Please put your hands towards Me. You'll become thoughtless and relaxed. This is the first state, where you become thoughtlessly aware.
