Now if you have Left Agnya, that means there’s a possession on us, somehow. That means all of you have got something of that kind, already you’re caught up, you’re not clean. It’s still there? See now. What is the mantra for this, Gavin, for the back Agnya?Gavin: Mahavira.Shri Mataji: No,no.Sahaja Yogi: Mahaganesha.Shri Mataji: Mahaganesha, Mahaganesha, Mahabhairava, correct. Now see, in the brain, we have got all these seats of the Gods. And they are the seats because they are the causal of these.So the first, the causal is created and then the Deities are created. So, for example, causal of the Mother Earth is fragrance, all right? So from fragrance comes the Mother Earth. In the same way, the causal of Brahmadeva is Hiranyagarbha, all right? He’s called as Hiranyagarbha. He’s the causal of Brahmadeva. Where does he stay in the brain? In the brain of the Virata, whatever Deities live, are the causal. And in ours also, because they’re reflected. So the causal ones are here in our brain, in our brain, in our brain. At the back here, around the Agnya, is who? Now I gave you the name.Sahaja Yogi: Mahaganesha.Shri Mataji: No, around the Agnya. Agnya is Mahaganesha and Mahabhairava, Agnya, at the back. And in front?All right, I’ll not trouble you.At the back is actually Mahaganesha, just in the center. Just in the central point is Mahaganesha which is the minutest point. Around him moves Mahabhairava, all right? And around this, the rest of it that moves is Hiranyagarbha, all right? Now did you follow that?

So when you think, or whatever thinking you do, through this superego, through this superego, you get the development of this Hiranyagarbha. Did you follow that? And also otherwise, is also, who acts when you think? Is Hiranyagarbha, isn’t it?

This is Swadisthana, we call it, this is Swadisthana chakra around, all right?So Swadisthana is divided into left and right. Left Swadisthana is Hiranyagarbha and right Swadisthana is also Hiranyagarbha, at the back here.So now to draw it out, first of all, at the back, if you move, is Mahaganesha. Around him moves Bhairava, who protects Mahaganesha. Around it moves, now who? Hiranyagarbha, at the back. But Hiranyagarbha has left and right side, while Bhairava and Ganesha, they move on each other. Did you follow that point?

Now in front, in the center here, is who? Kartikeya, in the center. Christ is in the center, in the center itself where the optic chiasma is. Here outside is Kartikeya. What is Kartikeya? Kartikeya is the protector of Christ. Around Kartikeya, they’re all protectors of Christ. Moves who now? Who is Mahabhairava’s counterpart?Sahaja Yogi: Hanuman.Shri Mataji: Mahahanumana, Mahahanumana, all right? And around that, what does move? Ekadasha Rudras.

The movement of Ekadasha Rudra is not circular, it is more like that. It is more like that. Or we can say, more like that.Now what is Ekadasha Rudra? Let us see. Can you give the names of Ekadashas? Take one by one.Buddha, all right? Mahavira. Then Christ. Then Mahabhairava. How many of them? Four?Sahaja Yogi: Four.Shri Mataji: Then Mahaganesha, five. You have said Bhairava? Again, again say it, again one by one. I mean, say it. Buddha.Sahaja Yogi: Buddha, Mahavira.Shri Mataji: Mahavira.Sahaja Yogi: Christ.Shri Mataji: Christ.Sahaja Yogi: Mahaganesha.Mahaganesha, Mahabhairava. [Cut in the audio]All right? It is very clear cut for you? Because just now I’ve told all of them.Buddha, Mahavira, Christ. Then, what else? Now four are left, four are still left. Sahaja Yogi: MahahanumanaShri Mataji: Mahahanumana, you didn’t tell? Mahahanumana, how much it is now?Sahaja Yogi: Four.Shri Mataji: Three left. No, four are left, four! Now what are these four? Mahahanumana. Say, it’s very simple. Just now I discussed with you Mahahanumana, Mahabhairava, two, Buddha, Mahavira. Four? Now,Sahaja Yogi: Kartikeya. Ganesha.Shri Mataji: Kartikeya, Ganesha, sixth.Sahaja Yogi: Christ.Shri Mataji: Christ, seventh. Now four more are left, now who are the four more? Let’s see.Can I have tea?

Oh! Pat, come along. You’ve done lot of reading. They have written it down into something, eleven of these.

Sahaja Yogini: Hiranyagarbha.Shri Mataji: Brahmadeva, Hiranyagarbha, or correct!Sahaja Yogi: Vishnu Narayana.Shri Mataji: Vishnu, Narayana.Sahaja Yogi: Shiva.Shri Mataji: Lakshmi Narayana, how much it is?Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible].Shri Mataji: Shiva, Parvati.Everyone. Shiva and Shakti, all right done! Eleven of them.

Lakshmi Narayana is one, Brahmadeva Saraswati is back, Shiva Parvati has... All eleven are there. Why Shiva and Parvati? Two have to be taken because Shiva is the Guru, Parvati is the Shakti.

So if you catch on Void, the beginning of the trouble starts because Shiva is the central part. The Shiva is to be taken as Guru. Shiva is Guru, Shiva is the one who is our Guru. He is our Spirit.

But he’s not the Spirit that protects because Spirit needs no protection, does it? Whom do you protect then, also. So when you protect, you protect the Spirit but what protects it, is the Guru personality which is Shiva. It is Shiva actually. Did you get that?

Now you might say, “How Shiva is guru?” “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo, Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat, Parabrahma, Tasmai Shri Guruveh Namaha.” Because Guru means a person who is full of ‘Gurutwakashan’, is weight, is the gravity. Person who is with gravity, which has some sense, which is density, which is our Spirit. Otherwise we have no density, we are useless. Our Spirit goes away, it’s floating there as bhoots. So, the Guru is everything.

Today I’ve called you here to tell you how to become a Guru. So that’s why I’ve given you this introduction. Is it clear to you? All right let Me know now.[Cut in the audio]

[Shri Mataji is laughing] See that? just laugh at yourself. With all your knowledge of how many years I've been talking to you, look at this, this is the point. How Mother raising your Kundalini just like that, do I tell you something. You all have gone to the wrong gurus, you have done, because... , nothing of the kind. Just because you're not set here, it's the Ekadasha Rudra on your forehead, if you bow before any wrong guru. With that your Ekadasha Rudra... Sahaja Yoga is very simple you know. If you put your glass upside down , if you put it like this . Sahaja Yoga is so simple, do you follow that point?

So we reach one conclusion, by mental understanding you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. So as a guru what should you have? I've made a promise. That's different. Yogini is asking a question. (not clear). You are telling like this, if I say that, "What is the test of, say, guru?" Do you say that it should not become artificial? Now let's see again quite straight forward, what is the question? No, no, what is the question? Now try to remember. Yogi: What should we have? Shri Mataji: Not at all! What is the question, let's see exactly. Exactly. Yogini: How do you clearing the catch from seing a false guru? How do you... This is another question but the question I asked is: then what must a guru do? The thing I said, by discussion Sahaja Yoga doesn't work out then what should we do? I asked the question what should we do?

Make it simple always related to your Mother, you'll get the answer. Hah! All right? To neutralize the old guru who has been a bad guru you have to surrender to the real guru. If your guru is the real guru then you surrender to the Mother of your real guru. Because your real guru is also surrendered to Me. So all gurus are to be surrendered at the lotus feet of your Mother. Then if it is Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, Shiva, Krishna, Christ, anyone of them also, Ekadasha still is more than your Mother's.

It is very difficult because we want to stick on to something, even the real guru. Christ is a real guru but the Christ you know of is to be also surrendered at the lotus feet of your Mother because we also know that. Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, all of them are My servants. Adi Shakti is the Mother. She's the Mother of all the gurus, of all the prophets, of all the incarnations, of all the . After Her, only Parabrahma is created, after that only Parabrahma. So when you have got someone like that to surrender, is the real problem, is a maya. That is the biggest problem because you've got somebody so easily. Arjuna was a great warrior till the war started, and somebody was a great swimmer when he came to the ocean. Allow your mind to do the work, allow your mind. So to be the highest guru is to be completely surrendered. 

Now when you are surrendered, you don’t doubt. Now when this finger is completely surrendered, say, to My body, it doesn’t doubt My body. Supposing I’m pressing and it receives the information that you are being hurt, she informs the brain and informs the body that I’m being hurt. But if she says, “Something must be done to remove it”, the whole body acts, all the fingers act and all the power flows there, the energy flows there where the finger is hurt.

So, when you are surrendered there is no question of individualism. Those people who think of any kind of individualism are going to go out of the circulation of Sahaja Yoga. It’s a big wheel, I’ve told you many a time. And the wheel takes out all those people who want to assert their individualism of any kind. Now see, this is a branch, all right, you can see here. In the last ever stage, I use the same analogy, it’s better [inaudible]. Outside is the Spirit, all right? If inside and outside, it’s the same and the rest is nectar, if you have proved just now [unsure]. It has to become this, what else to do? This myth has to go, all right? This myth has to vanish. So, this myth is based on what? Our ego and superego together. It has to be the end of all the nonsense we have been. To be the sense, all this has to go! Why? You see, it doesn’t exist at all! that is the way that people surrender. In no way, it is.

You cannot be a guru unless and until you are at least, at least, you are open to it, that’s coming and going. But supposing you’re like.It would be like a story I heard in India that there was a fool, two of them. They went inside the restaurant to have some food. They sat down at a table and they saw a glass put like this, all right? They said, “What sort of a glass is this? It has no mouth.” So, they called the bearer and said, “Please, make this all right. We can’t have our food unless and until it has a mouth. Please, take it back.” They said, “What sort of a glass is this? It has no bottom?” Because they saw the mouth. But when you’re surrendered the mouth and bottom [unclear], nothing exists. That surrendering is to be achieved if you’re going to be the gurus.Now, lock it down because these are very personal things I want to say. 

[Cut in the audio]

This is all mental, how do you . Have a bandhan. How many times you give yourself bandhan? Before sleeping, after getting up, then namaskar to your Mother, , touching My feet, very important, not to come on to the Agnya, supposed to correct. Even sitting down there I'm catching. Actually just do it now.  Do it . On both the feet, again you try. First right and then left. Ah! See now. It's not mental, this is the point I'm bringing you. It is not mental, now this is

is the point I’m bringing you. It is not mental, now this is (not clear) you all become mentally alert...not clear... open your heart. So sweetness is open your heart...not clear.  When others come we don’t tell them this is how we open our heart. Don’t tell them...not clear... How you open your left Vishuddhi, just say, “Mother I am not guilty. Mother I’m not guilty. Mother I’m not guilty.” 

Too much thinking, too much talking is bad.  Not talking, not thinking is bad. But little thinking, little talking is good.
