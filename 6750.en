Advice on Ekadasha Rudra. London (UK), 4 September 1981.

... In your heart, behold you there, in your heart. That, “Come and seat in the lotus feet - lotus of our heart”. Now the problem is towards this heaviness. Best thing is to clear this, for anyone.I’ll show you. Gavin, come! [Unclear] at my back. Push the photograph like this, all right?Here, somebody can help him. Ready now?[Unclear]Lethargy. It’s your heart. At your heart is your Mother’s love, the power of her love. Ah! Did you feel that? Keep your eyes open.

[Inaudible]Come forward.

Now if you have Left Agnya, that means there’s a possession on us, somehow. That means all of you have got something of that kind, already you’re caught up. You’re not clean. Still they are there? See now. What is the mantra for this, Gavin, for the Back Agnya?Gavin: Mahavira.Shri Mataji: No,no.Sahaja Yogi: Mahaganesha.Shri Mataji: Mahaganesha, Mahaganesha, Mahabhairava, correct. Now see, in the brain, we have got all these seats of the Gods. And they are the seats because they are the causal of these.So the first, the causal is created and then the Deities are created. So, for example, causal of the Mother Earth is fragrance, all right? So from fragrance comes the Mother Earth. In the same way, the causal of Brahmadeva is Hiranyagarbha, all right? He’s called as Hiranyagarbha. He’s the causal of Brahmadeva. Where does he stay in the brain? In the brain of the Virata, whatever Deities live, are the causal. And in ours also, because they’re reflected. So the causal ones are here in our brain, in our brain, in our brain. At the back here, around the Agnya, is who? Now I gave you the name.Sahaja Yogi: Mahaganesha.Shri Mataji: No, around the Agnya. Agnya is Mahaganesha and Mahabhairava, Agnya, at the back. And in front?All right, I’ll not trouble you.At the back is actually Mahaganesha, just in the center. Just in the central point is Mahaganesha which is the minutest point. Around him moves Mahabhairava, all right? And around this, the rest of it that moves is Hiranyagarbha, all right? Now did you follow that?

So when you think, or whatever thinking you do, through this superego, through this superego, you get the development of this Hiranyagarbha. Did you follow that? And also otherwise, is also, who acts when you think? Is Hiranyagarbha, isn’t it?

This is Swadisthana, we call it, this is Swadisthana chakra around, all right?So Swadisthana is divided into left and right. Left Swadisthana is Hiranyagarbha and right Swadisthana is also Hiranyagarbha, at the back here.So now to draw it out, first of all, at the back, if you move, is Mahaganesha. Around him moves Bhairava, who protects Mahaganesha. Around it moves, now who? Hiranyagarbha, at the back. But Hiranyagarbha has left and right side, while Bhairava and Ganesha, they move on each other. Did you follow that point?

Now in front, in the center here, is who? Kartikeya, in the center. Christ is in the center, in the center itself where the optic chiasma is. Here outside is Kartikeya. What is Kartikeya? Kartikeya is the protector of Christ. Around Kartikeya, they’re all protectors of Christ. Moves who now? Who is Mahabhairava’s counterpart?Sahaja Yogi: Hanuman.Shri Mataji: Mahahanumana, Mahahanumana, all right? And around that, what does move? Ekadasha Rudras.

The movement of Ekadasha Rudra is not circular, it is more like that. It is more like that. Or we can say, more like that.Now what is Ekadasha Rudra? Let us see. Can you give the names of Ekadashas? Take one by one.Buddha, all right? Mahavira. Then Christ. Then Mahabhairava. How many of them? Four?Sahaja Yogi: Four.Shri Mataji: Then Mahaganesha, five. You have said Bhairava? Again, again say it, again one by one. I mean, say it. Buddha.Sahaja Yogi: Buddha, Mahavira.Shri Mataji: Mahavira.Sahaja Yogi: Christ.Shri Mataji: Christ.Sahaja Yogi: Mahaganesha.Mahaganesha, Mahabhairava. [Cut in the audio]All right? It is very clear cut for you? Because just now I’ve told all of them.Buddha, Mahavira, Christ. Then, what else? Now four are left, four are still left. Sahaja Yogi: MahahanumanaShri Mataji: Mahahanumana, you didn’t tell? Mahahanumana, how much it is now?Sahaja Yogi: Four.Shri Mataji: Three left. No, four are left, four! Now what are these four? Mahahanumana. Say, it’s very simple. Just now I discussed with you Mahahanumana, Mahabhairava, two, Buddha, Mahavira. Four? Now,Sahaja Yogi: Kartikeya. Ganesha.Shri Mataji: Kartikeya, Ganesha, sixth.Sahaja Yogi: Christ.Shri Mataji: Christ, seventh. Now four more are left, now who are the four more? Let’s see.Can I have tea?

Oh! Pat, come along. You’ve done lot of reading. They have written it down into something, eleven of these.

Sahaja Yogini: Hiranyagarbha.Shri Mataji: Brahmadeva, Hiranyagarbha, or correct!Sahaja Yogi: Vishnu Narayana.Shri Mataji: Vishnu, Narayana.Sahaja Yogi: Shiva.Shri Mataji: Lakshmi Narayana, how much it is?Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible].Shri Mataji: Shiva, Parvati.Everyone. Shiva and Shakti, all right done! Eleven of them.

Lakshmi Narayana is one, Brahmadeva Saraswati is back, Shiva Parvati has... All eleven are there. Why Shiva and Parvati? Two have to be taken because Shiva is the Guru, Parvati is the Shakti.

So if you catch on Void, the beginning of the trouble starts because Shiva is the central part. The Shiva is to be taken as Guru. Shiva is Guru, Shiva is the one who is our Guru. He is our Spirit.

But he’s not the Spirit that protects because Spirit needs no protection, does it? Whom do you protect then, also. So when you protect, you protect the Spirit but what protects it, is the Guru personality which is Shiva. It is Shiva actually. Did you get that?

Now you might say, “How Shiva is guru?” “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo, Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat, Parabrahma, Tasmai Shri Guruveh Namaha.” Because Guru means a person who is full of ‘Gurutwakashan’, is weight, is the gravity. Person who is with gravity, which has some sense, which is density, which is our Spirit. Otherwise we have no density, we are useless. Our Spirit goes away, it’s floating there as bhoots. So, the Guru is everything.

Today, I’ve called you here to tell you how to become a Guru. So, that’s why I’ve given you this introduction. Is it clear to you? All right, let Me know. Now.[Cut in the audio]

[Shri Mataji is laughing] See that? Now, see now! Just laugh at yourself! With all your knowledge of how many years I’ve been talking to you, you can see simple point! How Mother is raising just talking just like that! Do I tell you something? “Because you all have gone to the wrong gurus, you have done - because!” Because nothing you can find, just because!

You are all saints here. If the Ekadasha Rudra is on your forehead, you used to bow before any wrong gurus. You catch on your Ekadashas. It’ simple. Sahaja Yoga is very simple, you know.If you put your glass upside down, nothing else can go inside. If you put it like this, it is exposed to the saints. It is that simple. It’s simple, Sahaja Yoga is so simple. Do you follow that point?

So, we reach one conclusion by mentally understanding it or not understanding Sahaja Yoga.

So, as a guru what should you have? I mean followers [unsure]Sahaja Yogini: You should not be caught up at Ekadesha Rudra. You should be-Shri Mataji: Should not what?Sahaja Yogini: You should have cool Ekadesha Rudra.Shri Mataji: But that’s different. You are telling like this, if I say that, “What is the test of, say, guru?” You will say that it should not become artificial? You know they are. Now let’s see again. Try to stay forward, what is the question?Sahaja Yogi: You should have discrimination, Mother.Shri Mataji: No, no. What is the question?[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible].Shri Mataji: Now try to remember.Sahaja Yogi: ‘To be a guru, what should we have?’Shri Mataji: What should we have?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: Not at all, what is the question?Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible].Shri Mataji: So, what is the question, let’s see exactly. Exactly.Sahaja Yogini: How do you clear the catches that come from seeing a false guru.Shri Mataji: Who’s speaking this? [Unsure] How do you?Sahaja Yogini: Clear the catches when one sees a false guru.Shri Mataji: This is another question. But the question I asked is most specific: then what must a guru do?Sahaja Yogi: Nothing, Mother.Shri Mataji: The thing I said, by discussion, Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work out. Then what should we do?Sahaja Yogi: Raise Kundalini, Mother.Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]. I asked the question, what should we do?Sahaja Yogini: Surrender. Surrender, do your prayers.Shri Mataji: Make it simple always. Relate it to your Mother, you’ll get the answer. Hah! All right?To neutralize the old guru, who has been a bad guru, you have to surrender to the real guru. If your guru is the real guru, then you surrender to the Mother of your real guru. Because your real guru is also surrendered to Me. It’s a fact [unsure].So, all gurus are to be surrendered at the lotus feet of your Mother. Then if it is ‘Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha’, Shiva, Krishna, Christ, anyone of them also, Ekadesha still is lower than your Mother’s devotion [unsure].

This is very difficult because we want to stick on to someone, even the real guru. Christ is a real guru. He is. But the Christ you know of, is to be also surrendered at the lotus feet of your Mother. Because He’s also my son. ‘Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha’, all of them are my sons.Christ has been created alone [unsure]. She is the Mother of all the gurus, of all the prophets, of all the incarnations, of all the creatures.After Her, only Parabrahma exists. She exists, after that only Parabrahma exists. So when you have got someone like that to surrender, She is the biggest problem. She’s a maya. That is the biggest problem because you’ve got someone so easily.Arjuna was a great warrior till the war started. And somebody was a great swimmer when he came to the ocean. Allow your mind to be [down? unclear]. Allow your mind. 

So, to be the highest guru is to be completely surrendered. Now when you are surrendered, you don’t doubt. Now when this finger is completely surrendered, say, to my body, it doesn’t doubt my body. Supposing I’m pressing it and it receives the information that, "You are being pressed", she informs the brain and informs the body that, "I’m being pressed". But when she says, “Something must be done to remove it”, the whole body acts, all the fingers act and all the power flows there, the energy flows there and the finger is healed.

So, when you are surrendered there is no question of individualism. Those people who think of any kind of individualism are going to go out of the circulation of Sahaja Yoga. It’s a big wheel, I’ve told you many a time. And the wheel takes out all those people who want to assert their individualism of any kind. Now see, this is a branch, all right, you can see here. In the last ever stage, I use the same analogy, it’s better [inaudible]. Outside is the Spirit, all right? If inside and outside, it’s the same and the rest is nectar, if you have proved just now [unsure]. It has to become this, what else to do? This myth has to go, all right? This myth has to vanish. So, this myth is based on what? Our ego and superego together. It has to be the end of all the nonsense we have been. To be the sense, all this has to go! Why? You see, it doesn’t exist at all! that is the way that people surrender. In no way, it is.

You cannot be a guru unless and until you are at least, at least, you are open to it, that’s coming and going. But supposing you’re like this.

It would be like a story I heard in India that there was a fool, two of them. They went inside the restaurant to have some food. They sat down at a table and they saw a glass put like this, all right? They said, “What sort of a glass is this? It has no mouth.” So, they called the bearer and said, “Please, make this all right. We can’t have our food unless and until it has a mouth. Please, take it back.” They said, “What sort of a glass is this? It has no bottom?” Because they saw the mouth. But when you’re surrendered the mouth and bottom, they all disappear and nothing exists. That surrendering is to be achieved if you’re going to be the gurus.

Now, lock it down because these are very personal things I want to say.

[Cut in the audio]

Mental! This is all mental! How do you [inaudible]. That and bandhan.How many times do you give yourself bandhan? [inaudible]. Before sleeping, after getting up, saying namaskar to your Mother, This is more than sufficient. Touching My feet, very important.Not to come on to the Agnya, supposed to correct. Even sitting down there I’m catching.

Just- actually, just do it now. Correct. Both, again. Do it on both the feet.Again you try. First right and then left. Ah! See now. It’s not mental, this is the point I’m bringing down to you. It is not a mental thing.

You all become mentally alert. And you come, "So, we must surrender ourselves to Mother". Then other say, "Yes, yes. You have to open your heart". Now, "Yes, we must open our heart. We have to do this". Nothing! When others come, you don't tell them, "This is how we open our heart". Don't tell them that. If there is a mistake, let them [inaudible].

How you open your Left Vishuddhi? Just say, “Mother I am not guilty. Mother I’m not guilty. Mother I’m not guilty”.

Not to bear anger within you. It comes from your liver. You may not even show anger but inside is sanger. So, just take it out, clear it out. Liver, if you go on accumulating another bearing stuff, also burns your liver. If you show it off, it burns other’s liver. So, best is to take it out. Now, say, take a pillow, hit it hard or whatever it is, you take it out. But don’t keep anger within yourself. If you are angry with someone, just try to forgive.

Now the thin people are the people who are more, on the physical way, not all right, physically. Fat people are the people who are not all right on the mental way. So, the people who are very thin should know that physically – mentally, I mean, the brain work, they are doing over these, they are thinking too much, they are more right-sided and they should try to reduce it.

So, this is all diet, you have to see about your diet. Too much of eating is really common in [unclear]. You all should have fix your food, how much you have food. Like, you see, my husband only three books, “What do you think the best food of the food which is not here?”But because English food has not such standard as [unclear], you see, you may eat the whole lot and you’ll tun out, “Why not?” [unclear], This is English type. And sometimes I’m surprised, you’ve eaten the whole lot and “Have some more.”[Laughter] Where is it going to go? No,

[Inaudible]Too much eating is very bad, too much talking I very bad. Not talking, not eating is bad. But little eating and little talking is good. Too much of eating should be stopped. I’ve seen, it’s very common. I mean, not with you people, [Inaudible]

The last thing that I have to tell you about the exercise. Those people who are thin should stop their mental exercise, go to thoughtless awareness, beat yourself with shoes. Do all the thing that are possible all the Nirmala vidyas. Those who are fat people should take to exercises, body exercises.Those who cannot sit on the ground should learn what is the problem, must be in their legs and feet. [Inaudible]You try to fix up your Mooladharas, I ‘ll tell you exercises, how to do for different baddhas and all that, I’ve told you how to take it out. All that is possible, you should do them to make your body, mind and your emotions so that [inaudible]. And that is that exercise, every day, you must do some exercise. Those who are too much thinking should do mental exercises. Those who are too much physically involved should do- on the physical problem, they should do physical exercises, depends on. You study yourself, what is the problem.Supposing, if somebody has complained that you have hurt them, accept it, just accept it! 

That’s the main thing [unsure] that there is somebody who can’t see that.If somebody says that you re upsetting them, accept it, sit down and find out, “Why do I upset them?”If somebody says that you are miserly, accept it. Somedody says, “You are provoking”, accept it.
