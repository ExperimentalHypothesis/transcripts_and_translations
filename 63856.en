Through Sahaja Yoga your Kundalini rises from this centre touching all the seven centres and opens your Sahasrara, you are open to the subtle power of God that pervades on you. And this power is so dynamic, it fills, it coordinates, it works, it breaks into small, small bits and overnight cooperates, works out not in you but in every one of you.  It has tremendous forces, it has all the destructive, constructive and creative, plus the evolutionary powers in it, and it thinks the vibrations that you have, powers that you have within you.  Once you become one with that all pervading power, that’s really physical, mental, emotional, everything goes in a higher level, in a very higher level of that subtle atmosphere where God rules, because His subtleness works in that area, in that new dimension. For example, an ant, is not bothered about the laws that are passed by human beings, it is not bothered by that, it doesn’t know that we have any laws, that in Caxton Hall you have to pay so much money, it walks in without paying any money at all. It walks in, it goes everywhere, eats any food it can find, it doesn’t think it is stealing, but we in our subtle way, have formed this government, whatever it is, but we know that there is a government which is ruling us and we live in that area of that subtler form.  But when you enter into the Sahaja Yoga area, where you become one with the all-pervading, then the governing capacity of God Almighty starts working and operating within us.  That time then you become the citizen of the Kingdom of God, and at that time you have no [unclear] and say for Britishers who are looked after, if you have no job then you are given say a dole, but there it is very different, but if you are dishonest you are put in the jail.  If you are honest, that is fine, you have to be honest, and if you are dedicated about it, then all the blessings are at your feet, all the blessings, all the Indians you have heard about, all of them stand around you. Today I have received a letter from a girl, she is about seven years of age, Pragya, and she fell from a fifth storey, she fell from a fifth storey, she said, ‘Mother, nothing happened.’ Just see for example, nothing happened, she said ‘I don’t know’. There was a small little string in between, I don’t know how it is there, and the string but nothing happened. Her father has written that [unclear].

After Sahaja Yoga, only thing you have to see is the miracle of the joy, how you are helped, how St Michael, we call as Bhairava and how St Gabriel, who we call as Hanumana, they are just running up and down, they are appointed for this job. But the first thing that happens to a Western mind is, the one who ran away, because I told him ‘you cannot come’ and he said, ‘is there anything wrong, should I say you commit sin and go to Hell? Because most of the gurus say that ‘you do whatever you please’ but pass on your possessions [unclear?], that’s all, they don’t tell you  don’t bring, don’t commit sin, just pass on your possessions, they don’t give you any experience, nothing.  They do not raise your Kundalini, they are not bothered, they are only bothered about how to raise funds. So awakening societies, there are many like that. You see, awakening to raise, but with this understanding that you enter into the Kingdom of God, be peaceful, be peaceful, station yourself, like kings you are [unclear].

This wall was made, you don’t know how many people have worked to make this wall, all the electrical arrangements, everything has been made so beautifully, and then the people come in the stage you see, everything is made for them, then come along, and don’t come like lepers and don’t come like beggars but come like kings.  This is your position, sit down and enjoy the blessing. That’s why it is created. Children take to it so easily just like that, they are just like kings and queens but the elders are rather difficult. The second thing that happens to them is ‘I cannot accept Mataji, I don’t know, it is very difficult to accept, this is the second nonsense that starts, it is very difficult to accept, why can’t you accept? Rationally accept, but where is the heart? You think but it is not there, it is all frozen, finished, you are accepting nothing with your heart, so mend it little bit, try to tell how much you have lost your heart already on useless things. On the road, while walking, how many times you have broken your hearts, everybody comes with hundred broken pieces to Me, and I have to stitch up their hearts for them.  I think that some of them have not come today, perhaps they do not know I am here, but now many people’s heart is [unclear]  at that point, the other day we had [unclear], his heart is absolutely broken and he said ‘now I cannot drive’, my heart is broken.

You go on doing all silly things, wasting your attention and energy on silly things and  then when it comes to receiving God’s blessings you say my heart is broken, what can we do?  If there is God, if he is there, if he is residing in your heart, if the heart is the temple of God, if he is the one in charge, how can we break the temple of God?  What heed have we paid to our heart? Have we looked after our heart? On the contrary, when you go on the ego orientation, you go to the extreme then you come back on yourself, you become hippies, take to drugs, hate yourself, hate everything that is your own, and become a hateful personality outside it.  Now this is too complex, you see, for Sahaja Yoga. There is no way to arrive at this, because like steep mountains, the ocean reaches very low which has to cross these deep frozen hearts, I hope they melt down a little more. So on one side, give up the ego-oriented ideas, watch your ego.

Firstly in Sahaja Yoga, we start using Sahaja Yoga for our personal problems, my mother is sick,  my brother is there, and this thing is there.  I am like this, finished.  The whole of the kindness is lost and according  to the year of somebody and settle down. If you are to be enlightened, you are to be enlightened for the purpose of giving light to others, it is not for yourself that you are going to be enlightened. Now supposing, I have to enlighten a light, I kill it, first, but not for the light’s sake.  Of course it is filled with love [unclear], but not for the light’s sake itself.  But to emit the light of life and bliss, joy, happiness and peace. That’s why the light is enlightened, and once the light is enlightened, it is not to be taken into a small little whole, where you, the little one is just jumping like a rat. It is not for that. It is for you to see if you are a rat now, and being so far a very small personality, come up now and grow in that light and become a huge person.  Not to waste that light, that divine light only for your own small little things but use it for a greater dimension, so that you become great too. Evaluate yourself, after all, getting Kundalini awakening is not dangerous, you must have heard, that it is very difficult time, but it has been bestowed upon you as a special favour, then value it, you are not a small person. If you have got it there must be something that might be, for ages you have been seeking it and that’s why today you have been blessed, so don’t play about with it, do not put yourself down to the level of a small little rat but become a great, magnanimous, huge personality.  You can, it is not difficult. Then perhaps many do not know that I will be coming, but whether coming or not, if I am coming or not, you all should be here, because there is one thing that is still lacking among Sahaja Yogis over here, so far because we haven’t had a proper place to meet on intimate lines, that we do not have that much of [unclear] as you call it, and our understanding about each other, about pure relationships, and things are not yet established that good as it should have been. So it is better that when I am not there  you will be much more [unclear], because when I am there I just talk, nobody else talks, so it is better that I should not be there sometimes so that you all talk and you meet, and she has given us a very good idea also, I liked it, by which we can have a seminar. I was thinking that if you could arrange a good seminar in October,  they are trying to arrange it.  Now give us ideas about it, where would you like to have it, and let us have more and more people for the seminar, where all of us can meet and can learn more about Kundalini awakening and  everything, and master everything together, because when you talk to each other you talk with more freedom.  With Me, you are little shy sometimes, sometimes you think whether you should tell Me or not, but I am the person to whom you should tell all these things, very important it is.  But that does not mean that you come out with your personal problems and everything you see, because if you immediately put your attention onto higher problems, all your minor problems will finish. It’s a very simple thing, you can understand this. You see, supposing I want to buy a property for a very big project, then big things come in, a bulldozer comes in and everything is washed up and cleaned up.  But if I want to buy a small little hut somewhere, you see, then I have to do everything myself and I create [unclear].  But if I have to do something big about it, then we get the help. So try to make yourself big, think on big lines, not only about yourself but about the bigger life that you want to do, immediately all your small problems, as they call it in Sanskrit, ‘shudra’ problems, will vanish.

Today I couldn’t tell you much about Kundalini, only small problems, but if you have any questions you can come and ask Me. I would like to tell you, and some of the people who have got Realisation can come and sit here and I will tell them. For example, you can come. Now, how are you feeling, the gentleman who is suffering from cancer?
