Public Program. Florence (Firenze) (Italy), 1992-0423.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I have to tell you that truth is what it is. We cannot conceptualise it. We cannot know it through the flight of our imagination. Unfortunately, we cannot also know at this human level, human awareness. Because it is subtler than human awareness. Within all of you there is divinity. But because of ignorance, you do not know it. Is not difficult. On the contrary, is the easiest to feel your divinity. Now whatever is told to you about this machinery within you, and whatever I’m going to tell you, you have to understand it with an open mind. Like a scientist, you must know that whatever I’m saying is a hypothesis. And when you find out that that is the truth, then you must accept, as honest people. So believe Me, that every human being is capable of achieving his divinity.

Every scripture has said that you are to be born again. And it is said that you have to know yourself: “Know thyself.” But it is not some sort of a artificial baptism, or artificial certificate, that you become a realised soul. But it is a living process of evolution. Like this in the triangular bone is placed this power for your ascent. This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother, the Feminine Power, God’s desire. We talk of God the Father, God the Son, and not of the Mother. How can it be a child there, and not the mother? So we talk of the Holy Ghost as a dove. But dove is just a symbol. But despite everything, people do believe in Madonna. So She is the Goddess and people worship Her. This power is the reflection of the same power. And when she is awakened, she passes through six centres, piercing through the fontanel bone area, giving you the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

In the modern times, there are so many seekers of truth. But they have been misled. Because there is in the market lots of people who want to make money. But you cannot pay any money for your evolution. Because it’s a living process. When you became a human being from amoeba state, how much money did you pay? Or else, how much money do we pay to the Mother Earth who sprouts all the seeds? So, one has to remember that it is your birthright to have this union with the all-pervading power.

So, there are two truths you have to know. One of them is that you should know that you are the Spirit. Not to know it mentally, but on your central nervous system. The second truth is to know that there is an all-pervading power which does all the living work. So, unless and until you feel that subtle power which does all living work, you are not to believe that you are a self-realised soul. This is how you have to be honest... this is how you have to be honest to yourself.

I hope tonight all of you will get your realisation. This knowledge is endless, is limitless. But best thing is first to have the light within you, and then try to understand this subtle knowledge. In the meanwhile, I would like you to ask Me some questions for about five, ten minutes, if you have any. But I’ve not come here to take anything from you. But to give you what is your own. So there should be no argument about something that should upset you. So please, ask Me questions which are relevant. And even if I answer, it is just a mental feat, that doesn’t guarantee your self-realisation.

So I would like you to ask Me some questions, and then I will give you self-realisation.

Domanda (ripetuta da Guido perché non si sente): Come si fa a fare dello yoga oggi quando si è così presi da questa vita forsennata?

(Shri Mataji laughs): It is only in the frantic world we start seeking the truth. Is only in the stagnated pools the lotuses grow. Have faith in yourself. It has been predicted that all the seekers of truth will be born in those modern times.

Domanda (ripetuta da Antonio Saracino): La domanda è questa: poiché Shri Mataji ha detto prima che la consapevolezza non ha limiti, il signore notava che c’è come una contraddizione, perché se si ottiene la realizzazione si ha la conoscenza completa; quindi come può essere questa conoscenza senza limiti, se è completa?

Shri Mataji: Like a drop becomes the ocean. Our limits are broken, and we become limitless. All right? That’s good (?). Very good questions, I must say. They are all great seekers sitting here.

Domanda (ripetuta da Guido): In order to awaken the Kundalini, is some kind of a spiritual preparation needed?

Shri Mataji: Is all... you see those who do not know the job try to escape.

You please don’t judge yourself, your Kundalini will judge you. This is the time of Last Judgement.

She is your individual Mother, she knows everything about you. As your own mother took up all the problems upon herself, and gave you your birth, in the same way She looks after you. So please be confident. Because this is the resurrection (time?). You will be resurrected.

Domanda (ripetuta da Guido): What should we do against those people who ask for money for the self-realisation?

(Shri Mataji laughs): You see, those who are asking money for self-realisation – you should not give them, that’s all, they’ll all run away. (Laughter).

This lady, raising her hand, just see what does she say.

Domanda (ripetuta da A. Saracino): Come mai in politica sono sempre gli ignoranti, e mai gli illuminati, che emergono, che hanno il potere?

(Shri Mataji laughs): You only let them! (Laughter and applause)

Domanda: Qual è la via adatta per mettere in comunione il sé piccolo con il Sé supremo?

Shri Mataji: This is what we are going to do, like this instrument (microphone) has got this chord, you see? To be connected to the mains. In the same way we have Kundalini within us, which will have to be just awakened and you’ll get connected.

It is like a seed, when you put it in the Mother Earth, the Mother Earth has the capacity to sprout it automatically.

Domanda: Perché per Milarepa è stato così duro e per noi è così facile?

Shri Mataji: You are special people! (Applause)

They must have passed.. just say...you have to say that...just a minute (problems with microphone) ....you have gone through all this in your previous lives. (Problems with microphone). All right?

Domanda: Io volevo chiedere, per favore: se con delle tecniche, con della gestualità, si può veramente muovere queste energie, se non c’è una dovuta presa di coscienza, non potrebbero essere usate male?

Shri Mataji: It is never dangerous, never dangerous. But is better that you know, after your realisation. I hope there will be some courses given to you to tell you how to use it, and how to perfect yourself, free of cost.

Domanda: Io non ho una domanda speciale, però volevo dire questo: da poche persone sento parlare di Madre, mentre sentiamo solo parlare di Padre. E volevo semplicemente che Lei mi dicesse, se può, qualcosa di più sulla Madre.

Shri Mataji: You see, I’m so happy that in Italy people have so much respect for their mother and also for Madonna. It’s rather surprising why they did not describe about Christ’s Mother in the Bible. The last words spoken of Christ where He says: “Behold the Mother.” In all other scriptures of the world, this Primordial Mother is discussed, and everybody has talked about that that She is the Power, She is the Shakti.

Domanda: Io volevo chiedere questo: da una decina d’anni seguo queste filosofie. Mi sono accorto che c’è un gran movimento di filosofie orientali verso l’Occidente, anche qui in Italia ne abbiamo diverse: lo Zen (...) Non si rischia di creare una certa confusione? Cioè, non si perde di vista qual è la retta via da apprendere?

Shri Mataji: That is quite true. You see, when the market started in the West, they all got themselves exported to make money. I’m sorry for that, and I feel ashamed as an Indian. They took advantage of you people. But if you are a seeker, you will get your realisation. Don’t you worry about anybody else. Have faith in yourself.

Domanda: Perché Buddha è grasso e Cristo è magro?

Shri Mataji: You see, that’s a mistake, Christ was never a thin man. Because they were so happy people, such joyous. Only Michelangelo could see Him clearly, in his Sistine Chapel he has put (?) Him properly like a huge big man. But on the table down below they have put a skeleton of Christ, with skin on top of that. Is absolutely horrible! That is just to excite your sympathy, I think. With that kind of a body, like a skeleton, can you carry the cross over the Calvary?

Domanda: When the strength is coming from within, we can ...mountains...

Shri Mataji: No, that is true, but such people, you see, mostly thin people suffer from liver. Or over-activity. Also the Mother of Christ is always shown as a fat person. Now these are modern fashions that you should become like a mosquito.

Mona Lisa is a famous painting, Mona Lisa: she was a very fat woman! Is all the craze of the entrepreneurs you are playing into. They are making a fool out of everyone. Also, a divine personality needs water to protect these centres, the chakras. If you want to become actors or actresses then it’s different (laughs), but for a divine person you don’t worry about your body much. Say, now, I’m sixty-eight, I’ll be sixty-nine years of age, and I’m every day travelling.

Domanda: Volevo sapere se secondo Lei, secondo voi, questo è l’unico sistema per la realizzazione del sé, o se viene accettato anche il ricorso ad altre forme di meditazione come Kriya Yoga, Yogananda ecc.

Shri Mataji: No, the only way is that the Kundalini has to be awakened, like this one (microphone) only way to make it start is to put to the mains. Is there any other way?

Domanda: Io vorrei chiedere che differenza c’è, fra questo Yoga - se c’è - e gli altri yoga che vengono effettuati, le dottrine yoga che ci sono ormai da molto tempo in Italia.

Shri Mataji: See, others are not Yoga: Yoga means union with the divine.

Now, should we have our self-realisation? At the very outset, I’ve to tell you that you cannot force self-realisation on anyone. Because I respect your freedom. Those who do not want to have self-realisation, should leave the hall. It will hardly take about ten minutes. Not more than ten minutes, and you will feel the all-pervading power. There are two conditions to be followed: one of them is that you are not to feel guilty at all about anything whatsoever. At this moment, you should forget the past. And have respect for yourself, because you are human beings. You are not God, so if you make mistakes, doesn’t matter. Because the Divine is ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you might commit, He is capable of dissolving it completely. If you feel guilty, then this centre on the left hand side catches very badly. And sometimes with this catching you might get a disease called angina. Is a disease of the heart. You might get the cancer of the cervical. Cancer of the cervical, cervical bone, here. Or you might get spondylitis. Or else you might also get lethargic organs on the left side. So please do not feel guilty at all, be happy with yourself. Forgive yourself.

All right. The other condition is that you have to forgive everyone. I have seen that Italians find it very difficult to forgive (Shri Mataji laughs). The other day I was sitting till four o’clock in the morning - they came to Me and they said: “Mother, we can’t feel it.” And all of them had not forgiven others.

Now logically, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, we don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands. You torture yourself, while the person who has troubled you is quite a happy person. So is the greatest weapon we have is to forgive, so nobody can torture you. This is the second condition. I hope you note it down, because otherwise later on you will all say, ‘I didn’t feel it.’

Now. Simple thing is now is to see how we are to help ourselves and raise our own Kundalini, and then we’ll close our eyes. We have to sit not with any strain, neither bending nor backwards nor forwards, with both the feet apart from each other. You will know there are two powers, left and right. The left is the power of desire and the right is the power of action.

Now. Can I request you also to take out your shoes, so that this Mother Earth can help us a lot to suck in our problems. Let them all be seated, they all should sit down. This lady also, ask her to sit down. What did she say? All right. Now show them. Please put your left hand towards Me like this. (...) on your lap. Now. This is symbolic of your desire to have self-realisation. Then, please use your hand for nourishing your centres as we tell you.

Put your right hand on your heart. There resides the Spirit. Then put your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. This is the centre of your mastery. Because when you become the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit you become your own guide, your own master. Then take down your right hand in the low portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the knowledge, this is the power of – or we can say the centre – of the pure knowledge, which works out all the divine work. Now raise your hand again in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now raise your right hand onto your heart. Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and turn your head to your right. I’ve told you that you catch this centre when you feel guilty. Now. Take your right hand on your forehead across. And bend your head as far as possible. This is the centre where you have to forgive others. Now. Take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. This is the centre where, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to ask for forgiveness from the all-pervading divine power of God’s love. Now. Stretch your hand fully. Put the centre part of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which is the soft bone in your childhood. Now, put down your head as far as possible, push back your fingers, and press it hard. And now start moving your scalp seven times clockwise. Bend your heads, bend your heads.

All right. Now. You can take out your spectacles because you have to close your eyes. If anything is tight on your stomach, or on your back, you can loosen it a little bit, or on your neck. Put your both the feet apart from each other.

Now. Please put your left hand towards Me, and right hand on your heart. Now, please close your eyes, and don’t open them till I tell you. Here you have to say, or ask a very fundamental question to Me – you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji – so you have to say, ask a question: “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask this question three times.

Now. If you are the Spirit, you are your master. Now, please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here, now, you have to ask another fundamental question to Me, three times: “Mother, am I my own master?” I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom, and I cannot force pure knowledge on you, so you have to ask for it.

All right. So now please take your right hand in the low portion of your abdomen and put, press it hard with your fingers, and ask six times – because this centre has got six petals. Now. Please ask Me six times: “Mother, please, give me pure knowledge.” When you are asking this question, the Kundalini starts rising slowly. So now, we have to nourish our upper centres with our self-confidence. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, and press it hard on the left hand side. We are working on your left hand side. Here you have to say, with full confidence, ten times: “Mother, I am my own master.” I’ve already told you that the greatest truth about you is that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this ego or your conditionings, but you are pure Spirit.

So now, please raise your right hand on top of your heart. With full confidence you have to say twelve times: “Mother, I am the Spirit.” This divine power of God’s love is the ocean of compassion, is the ocean of absolute truth and knowledge. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. So, whatever mistakes you might have committed in the past, can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness. So now. Raise your hand and put it onto the angle between your shoulder and your neck, and press it hard, push back as much as possible, and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times, with full confidence: “Mother, I am not guilty at all.” (Shri Mataji asks Guido to massage Her Vishuddhi, and while he does so, She says: “It’s terrible. Little lower, little lower. That’s good). I’ve already told you that whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands, and torture yourself and suffer yourself. But those who have troubled you are happy people, and you are playing into their hands!

So now please raise your right hand, put it on your forehead across, and bend your head (Guido puts his hand on the back agnya of Shri Mataji). Bend your head, and now you have to say with full confidence, from your heart, not how many times: “Mother, I forgive everyone.” Please bend your heads. (Shri Mataji moves Guido’s hand from Her back agnya to the left side of Her head). Bend your heads, please bend your heads. Say from your heart.

Now. Please take back you right hand onto the back side of your head and push back your head. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to say again from your heart, not how many times: “Oh Divine power, if I have done anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me.” Say it again from your heart.

Now the last centre. You have to stretch your palm, your hand fully. Now. Put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area and press it hard. Push back your fingers. Push back your fingers and put down your head properly. Here again I cannot cross over your freedom. You have to ask for your self-realisation. So you have to say seven times, moving your hand on your scalp clockwise, moving your scalp with a force, say: “Mother, please, give me my self-realisation.” (Shri Mataji puts Guido’s hand on Her Sahasrara. Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.)

Now. Please take down your hands. Open your eyes. Put your right hand towards Me like this. Bend your head. And see with your left hand if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Sometimes it can be hot. Bend your heads, bend your heads.

Now. Please put your left hand – now see with the right hand if there’s a cool breeze over your heads. Bend your heads, bend your heads. Not on top. Away. Sometimes you get quite far away.

Now. Again put your right hand towards Me, and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head.

Now. Put your both the hands towards the sky, and bend your head backwards. Look upwards. Ask a question now three times, anyone of these questions: Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Or: Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God’s Love? Or: is this the Paramachaitanya? Anyone of these questions you can ask three times.

Now put down your hands please. Put your hands towards Me like this, little higher. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze out of their hands, or out of their fontanel bone area, cool or hot breeze, please raise both your hands.

May God bless you. I bow to all of you. So now the new growth of your saintliness has started. Now you have to know how to fix up your realisation. The musicians have to come here on the stage. Now. Those who want to meet Me are welcome on the stage. (Applause).
