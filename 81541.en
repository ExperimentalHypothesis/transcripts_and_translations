When I was small, my mom always had me say the Ganesh Atharvashirsha and the Devi Kavach. I really enjoyed saying them, and because of this, I worshipped Shri Ganesha and the Devi.

When I was in school, my sister got her realisation first, and then we started going to the center. I really enjoyed the center; I found it very peaceful and happy. We didn't meet Shri Mataji straight away, but after a few months, she came to Pune. It was the time of Shri Ganesha Puja. My sister went to where Mother was staying and met her. When she came home, she said, "I saw Shri Mataji!" and inside my mind, I thought, "I must go and see Shri Mataji."

The next day, I said to my mom, "I'm going to meet Shri Mataji today. Don't wait for me when I come back home." At that time in Pune, there was so much traffic because of the Ganesh festival when they install the statues, so the streets were jammed. But I went by myself. I just said to myself, "I want to meet Shri Mataji, and I will not come back home until I do."

I got the address and went there. I didn't knock; I just stood outside the door and prayed to Mother inside. Then, a foreigner came and opened the door, so I followed him into the sitting room. There were photographs of Mother and everything. Inside, I was just praying, "Shri Mataji, please, I want to see you today, I want to meet you."

Another lady came and asked me so many questions. She said, "No, the puja is tomorrow. You can meet her there." But I didn't say anything; I just stood there, praying.

A little while later, Shri Mataji came and sat on the sofa. Yogi Mahajan was there, and they were offering Durva, the green grass for Shri Ganesha, as part of the puja. Shri Mataji was chatting with us, and I felt such tremendous joy.
