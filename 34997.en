Sahaj Behavior, Seminar Part 1, Los Angeles (USA), 1985-05-28

So, that’s a very good stanza if you can remember it by heart, I’ll say it again: [Sanskrit stanza from Adi Shankaracharya]
 "Pratah smarami hridi samsphura ta twam 
 Satchitsukham paramahansa gatim turiyam"
 The second part of it:
 "Yat swapna jagara sushupta mavaiti nityam 
 Tad Brahma nishkalamaham na cha bhuta sanghaha."

So, the second part is - So, the first part, as I told you, is the Spirit which we must bow to, which is the "sat chit ananda", the one which gives you truth, the enlightened attention and the joy and which takes you beyond the fourth dimension [turiya].
 "Yat swapna jagara sushupta mavaiti nityam": which is awake under the three conditions of our consciousness. There are three conditions of our state, of our consciousness. The first is the sleeping condition, when we are sleeping. Another is the awakened, and sushupti is beyond, beyond the sleep. In all these states of consciousness, it is awake, that Brahma, that All-pervading Power. I am that [prap] All-pervading Power that Brahma, not the combination of five elements. I’m not just the combination of five elements "bhuta sanghaha". But I’m that All-pervading Power, that Atma which connects you to that All-pervading Power, and I’m not just this reflector which is the combination of five elements. 

Just when you think like that, early in the morning, you just rise above and then you do not start with mundane ideas about life, but you start your ideas and understanding, your behavior, your whole life style starts from that angle that, “I’m that; I’m not this.” And the whole pattern changes.

That doesn’t mean you should be serious; that doesn’t mean that. You are in joy, but the style of our existence has a very different pattern and a different tune and a different colour, which is very easy for Sahaja Yogis, not difficult, because you are already there. Only thing, you must feel your atmosphere around you, where are you. [Inaudible] otherwise I’ll go on giving lectures.

Only problem comes when you become a mother. Then you feel very concerned and worried; that’s all. Otherwise, it is quite self-explanatory, the situation that exists. What to do? You want to do something about it. But they think they are obliging us. [Shri Mataji is laughing]

But traditionally, Indians are lucky people, I think [Hindi].

Like Avdut we have there. Now he is married. He’s going to France. I don’t know, he’s going to get shocks after shocks, there. He’s so innocent, he is very simple-hearted fellow. So, he says to Me, Avdut, “Mother why do the” (when he was very young) “why do the boys and girls leave their parents in the West?” So, I said, “They think they should be independent.” He said, “But then the bhoots of the parents, do they leave them or not? If you leave your parents will the bhoots leave you?” I said, “May be, may not be. Depends on the bhoots.” “Nothing on us?” I said, “Yes, it also depends on you but it’s nothing sure.” Then he said, “No use leaving the parents also because the bhoots are not going to leave you.” But with the parents there’s one thing; new bhoots cannot come to you first of all. Supposing you want to smoke, then your father will tell you, “Don’t smoke.” But if you go away from your parents then the bhoots will tell you, “You smoke.” You’ll smoke. You’ll do everything; so at least there’s some check in the house. That’s an innocent thinking, you know, just innocent.

Somebody’s walking.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi] He went to [unclear] and drives here also.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: Ha.

Shri Mataji: All the way from Vancouver? All the way from Vancouver you’ve come?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, it’s all right.

Shri Mataji: How many days?

Sahaja Yogini: Two and a half.

Shri Mataji: It’s our [unclear].

Sahaja Yogi: Nothing is too far to travel to see You, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogi: No one thinks it’s too far to come and travel to see You.

Shri Mataji: It’s quite a lot, I must say, two and a half days with children. So, what is happening in Vancouver now? Let’s have it.

Sahaja Yogini: I have not been living in the centre, Mother, but from what I’ve been told from talking with Lauren and Carrie, centres are looking very neat and more people are coming to meditations. It’s becoming really heartening that the turnout and the response to You, it’s becoming very positive, they feel. They have three or four regular people going now which has just started the last three or four months. It’s just nothing else, I guess.

Shri Mataji: I’m very happy to hear that. Because she wrote Me a very desperate letter few months back. Here’s the Pujas have helped a lot, I think. That’s true.

They have to be serious about it. It’s a, the thing is now or never. Question is like that: now or never. And the emergency is to be felt, and if it is felt in the atmosphere people will turn to Sahaja Yoga, will turn. But first of all, Sahaja Yogis have to be that proper, you see. They should be very proper people. That’s the main point. They fight among themselves, they talk ill about each other, they play games, they plan against each other. Then how can Sahaja Yoga spread? [Hindi].

His father was one of the first Sahaja Yogis, and both of them dedicated their life to Sahaja Yoga. Actually, when he died, I was not there; I had gone to Australia where I came to know about it. But every Sahaja Yogi felt tremendously about it. And now when we will be having our school...

Sahaja Yogi: Right, yes.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]. Her contribution hai. [Hindi] He’s the one who had that experience. In his absence he said that I went and represented him in the court. Did you hear that miracle?

Sahaja Yogis: Oh, yes. Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: And mother was also [Hindi]. He is so dedicated; so dedicated he was. His sense of gratitude [Hindi].

Sahaja Yogi: Bara, bara.

Shri Mataji: I mean, he had such sense of gratitude for Me that I gave him Realization that very few people I find with that depth, that they feel it. I mean, his life was completely dedicated to Sahaja Yoga, absolutely. And he understood Sahaja Yoga so well, very intelligent man. I’ll miss him very much. But it so happened when he was very sick, not very sick in the sense he was moving about, but I wanted to see him before going to Australia. And thrice I tried and I couldn’t go. Then I was wondering why I can’t reach him because there was a big crowd for a meeting once. One day, there was a strike; they wouldn’t allow us to go. Third day something happened. Three times I just could not go and see him. So, I was wondering why it is, but I thought that maybe that the Divine does not want Me to see him like that, in that condition; doesn’t want Me to see that because that could hurt Me very much. I’d seen him absolutely always very healthy. I never saw him sick

Sahaja Yogi: No, no. He used to have good health, that’s why, at that age.

Shri Mataji: Very good health [Hindi]. Mother was a composer. She used to make poems herself and then she used to compose them in melodies. And she was herself a musician. She’s a very good housewife. She suffered a lot in her life, I think, because of her, one of the sons was cursed by some horrible gurus who came in the house, that all his life history should be written down for people to understand. They were very nice people, good people, husband and wife, and this boy was very intelligent, and some people came in their house, you see. They said, “We want to stay over for overnight. We are sadhus.” So, they thought, “Sadhus are our guests, after all.” So, they allowed them to stay in the house. The stayed on for about eight days and these people looked after them, did this and that. And then the son discovered that they were very bad people, and the father also. He took them out. So, they did something to the son. So, it’s very dangerous. So, the father said to Me one thing which was really very important. He said that, “Without Self-realization you cannot make out who is good and who is bad, and there was no discretion on my part to allow these people to come in the house. I thought they are sadhus and we should not say ‘no’ to them.” They talked so well because in India everybody knows about Spirit. Talking is very easy. [Hindi]. “Don’t part. We all know everything by heart.” So, to talk about God, it’s very easy for them.

And there are so many like that. We had one fellow called as Gulab Baba. His father was working with My husband in Shipping Corporation and the father said that, “He’s such a vagabond and he’s such a horrible fellow that I don’t know what to do with my son. So, you give him a job on the ship.” He was given a job on the ship. So, he went on the ship to, to know, to all over the places he went. And he was the purser on the ship; they call it a purser. He tried to take away all the purse on the ship and he smuggled things, did all sorts of things that are possible under the sun. So, they had to ask him to get out of the job. [Hindi]. His name was Chotu. And when he came back My husband had to tell him, “I can’t keep you on the job because, you see, this is the purser’s job, and in the way you have done the whole thing is just against any government rules and regulations. So, we can’t keep you there.” So, he was driven out of the job. And the father died just after that.

So, the son disappeared after some time from Bombay, and the mother came to see Me and she said that, “He told me that he would like to do some business. So, we have put our house on/loan, we have mortgaged our house, we have given all our property, all our jewelry, everything to him. And he’s gone for a business, and we are left high and dry. We don’t know what to do. Now the people have come and they want us to get out of the house.” Because that time we had come to London. I said, “All right, I’ll ask Shipping Corporation if they can give you temporary help or something.” So, they arranged for a house for her for a while. She was very upset about the whole thing. After a year I went back. She said that, “He has again purchased the house and he’s given everything back to us and we got everything, all mortgages are over and he’s sending us also money but I don’t know what is he doing, what, what business he has done.” She couldn’t make it up for some time. Then after two, three years she told me that he has become Gulab Baba. Oho. And he was working it out in Nagpur, of all the places. So, some people came and told us that there’s, there’s one fellow called Gulab Baba who has come, is showing funny miracles and he is just trying to befool people. Like he went to one place and he said, “Now the water is going to come out of this place.” And when he hit there the water started coming out. And there’s was actually a municipal pipe down there. And he had arranged it in such a way that with a slightest hit the thing should come out. And then the people started beating him. He ran away and all that.

So, I told this man, “You go and tell Gulab Baba that I’m coming to Nagpur and I want to meet you.” He ran away from Nagpur forever. That’s My place, Nagpur, all My brothers are from that place. So, for Americans it is necessary to give bandhan to the Sikhs of America. It’s very important. Because of the misunderstandings they had or whatever happened politically, now the stay of foreigners in India is limited to only three months, and going to India itself is rather difficult. You have to take a special permission and all that. You have to take a visa now to go to India. Formerly there was no visa required. Did you take a visa when you came last time?

Sahaja Yogi: To India?

Shri Mataji: India.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: See.

Sahaja Yogi: There I had a visa the first time.

Shri Mataji: First time. I mean, it was an open place to go. But also, this Yogi Bhajan is the one who has created another problem because he converted them into Sikhism and they are the ones who carried lot of arms, amunitions. [Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: That’s right.

Shri Mataji: Both of them were Realized souls. They are in their joy, will take their birth again to help us out. But they are perfectly all right. They have no problems of any kind. So, I am just telling him that they have done their duty. They have really contributed so much that God is very much pleased with them, and you will be blessed, children will be blessed for what good they have done for everybody else. And you should also follow their pattern, that they lived for others, never for themselves. Selfishness [Hindi]. Never, no selfishness at all. We lived for others. [Hindi]

So, I would like to baptize the baby now. [Hindi] Olive oil [Hindi] she is better. [unclear] rather cold. Aj birthday, that’s it. Today she’s all right. Today she’s all right. Slept well? [Shri Mataji is speaking with Sahaja Yogis and with the baby in Hindi] Normally they don’t cry for nothing at all. They use to preserve their energies. We are also sending one gentleman there, in, where she got, [Mona]?

Sahaja Yogis: Mona? Here...

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]? Ha. This Bala, Bala is coming to Montreal, but Montreal is more a French side, I think. He said that he will try to establish something there. He’s quite powerful. But later on, he’s getting a job here.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: I spoke to him. [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] got a job. She got him a job, this one is. And then they got one job who came forward and then the second one. But they said for emigration will take six months more. So, that’s why he was going to... He was working with Rolls Royce.

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, are va.

Shri Mataji: Ha, Rolls Royce. But in England they are paid very low, very low, very low.

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, I see.

Shri Mataji: Even Rolls Royce and all that paid so little that it is better to be a road builder or a garbage cleaner than to be an engineer there.

Sahaja Yogi: That’s right.

Shri Mataji: Money wised [GW: wise?]. They have no respect for education, no respect. That way Australia is differently made. But this is coming everywhere. Even Sweden, Norway, they do not care for education much. For higher education, they do not care. Even in [many type/ maritime] activities they don’t want to educate people in, on the higher level, just make them technicians, that’s all. They want to make them technicians.

Sahaja Yogi: Trades require [in Australia].

Shri Mataji: Trade, later, trades, trades. I don’t know what is the logic, but that’s what they are going to do. Engineer [Hindi speaking with a Sahaja Yogi]. This computer is a very dangerous sign again. You see, it can become a monster itself.

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, is that right?

Shri Mataji: Yes, it can. It can go out of your hands. If it starts acting, you see, you have to be very careful.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

[Shri Mataji talking in Hindi with a Sahaja Yogi.]

Sahaja Yogi: That’s why it is going to be out of control, they say, by mistake.

Shri Mataji: By mistake [Hindi]? One split second [Hindi]. Simple thing is, “Don’t fight.” Russians and Americans, there is no need for them to fight at all. I mean... This is a Krishna bhumi. It’s Rama only, isn’t it? And Russia was made by Luv and China was made by Kush. So, they are fighting against their father.

Shri Mataji talking in Hindi with a Sahaja Yogi about Luv and Khush.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] The country is called as Khushar, Khushar country. [Hindi] We have got lots of proofs. Already there are some families, Indian families called as Luv who are staying there in, in Caucasus. They came down. And there’s a temple of the Goddess of Hindu [Leela] there, in, on their way to Caucasus. And the whole, if you see, Chinese language has so much of Marathi words, that I was amazed. Like they say Mao Tse Dung, Tse is only Marathi. Have you heard “tse” anybody says? Only the Chinese and Indians speak that “tse”, and so many words are Marathi, so many. And the Russians have one Marathi word, which is very common, is sakhar.

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, is that right?

Shri Mataji: Sakhar, sakhar bolo.

Sahaja Yogi: Sakhar? Sakhar like that? Wow!

Shri Mataji: So, many words are so common, that’s surprising. And I could pronounce their words very clearly. So, they were surprised. They said, “How do I know Russian?” and then they became suspicious. Same with Chinese. And in a way, you can see that wisdom in their heads, you see. Both are very wise people. They are not stupid, like the Americans are. They are not stupid people, very clever. And I don’t know if the cleverness is going to work out the things. Like see now, the one wisdom they have shown, Russians, that they had a barter system with India. They said, “All right, whatever we will send you, you instead give us rupees for that.” All the machinery, that junk they had, they sold us and took the rupees. Out of that they bought our carpets, [stipple layers, stabilizers?], and also beautiful laces and then this and that. If you go into their houses you won’t believe; they had all palaces.

They live so well. Very wise people. You see, to get it in rupees and get all the handmade things from India at a cheap rate, and they also asked us to make very beautiful crockery for them. So, India is making these things. Crockery started because of them. Beautiful crockery. So, if you go to their houses, you’ll be amazed, how many things they have in so cheap rate, handmade things. They have got all kind of leopard’s coats, this coat, that coat, all kinds of things from India they have. Very clever people. The other wisdom these Chinese have shown that they developed [the village] I should say wiser than Indians, because they developed their villages first. They took all the ideas of Gandhiji. First, they developed their villages and now they are developing their cities. So, they have done everything so fast. We were the other way round, see. We became British.

Sahaja Yogi: Developed the cities.

Shri Mataji: We pay for it. We developed the cities. So, we are paying for this. We thought Gandhiji was no good. But they were so wise. So, you see, they show the, that wisdom, or I say the Maharashtrian wisdom in them, because Sitaji lived in Maharashtra for so many years, you see.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi about Shivaji]. They are so fond of Shivaji; that’s something surprising, Russians are. So, fond of Shivaji and also fond, of course, Mahatmaji very much. Surprising it is. How they picked up these things from Gandhiji, I don’t understand. This Mao is the one who did everything. So, many plans that Gandhiji had, they have worked it out. Like in India they said, “He is stupid, this, that.” Nobody would pay attention. We, we were all egoistical like English not to see the sense. One of the plans Gandhiji had was very sensible, that took the big canals along the roads and to put fishes in the canals, and also to be used for extra transport, you see, through the boats and all that. Same thing they did it. Every road has got canals on both the sides, and the same canals when they are overflowing are also used for giving water to their plants, I mean fields. Same thing, so many things that Gandhiji has done it, they have used.

But, you see, our bureaucrats are all educated in English language, and I don’t know what they are to do. It’s a big mess. And also, they had no discretion. Like our telephone system in India is thanks to the French. French put that telephone system in India, and you know how it is working. This is all done by French. Can you believe it? It’s the French people who did this. Now we can’t change it. The whole thing they have spoilt it. Such self-opinionated people like French. Why should you have asked the French to do it? Whatever they did, they made a mess.

And another wisdom Russians have, they have another very great wisdom, which Americans don’t have. This is the trouble with them; they must learn this wisdom is, that whenever you give something to someone, have grace about it; otherwise, whatever you give it’s lost. Russians are very clever. They’ll give this little but they’ll have such a grace you see with it that people feel attached to it. This is al, a basic wisdom. While here, they have given help to us in India. Like they sent us the worst wheat possible because they dumped their wheat here. So that wheat they sent us. Out of that wheat they mixed it up with some sort of an acacia. That acacia when they took it out, I mean, most of the women threw away that wheat.
And that acacia had a kind of a seed in it, God knows what was that, that it grew into huge big trees of thorns. [Hindi] They call it a mad acacia. And the thorns are poisonous. And once we were having a program, and Alan Nix who was the only American we had, and the thorns went into him. Of course, we cured him but I mean it happened like that. And then they gave a kind of rice also. No, this happened in India, acacia thing came with the rice. And the, and the, the wheat you see, wheat was so bad that Indians couldn’t eat it. So, they threw it away, and out of that wheat came out the monster called congress grass. They call it a congress grass because you have a congress here. So, they call it congress grass. It started eating up all the fields, everything. So, when the people came to Me, they said, “Mother, do something about it. We don’t know how to destroy it.” “You cannot destroy it. You have to dig up the whole thing for ten feet; then you might be able to destroy it, so bad it is.” Then it rained and rained and rained for seven days and the whole thing got completely finished. Otherwise, they didn’t know what to do; it was eating every crop, everything in Maharashtra. 

So, they think by aggressiveness, by showing off, people are interested. They are not. And then you commit mistakes like this, that you go and visit the SS people to... [Hindi] People don’t like it even in America all that. They don’t like it, I know. But this is the situation here. To do such a thing was very, very wrong, I think, because nobody liked it. An adamant [huh].

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: What’s wrong? That has brought down the image of America verily.

Sahaja Yogi: They think they can buy anything with money.

Shri Mataji: Aaa?

Sahaja Yogi: They think they can buy anything with money, including people also.

Shri Mataji: Including people. [Hindi] Any self-respect nahin milega.

Sahaja Yogi: Self-esteem ecdam low.

Shri Mataji: Self-respect nahin hai. You see, it’s through tradition only one learns graciousness. Those people who are not traditional cannot learn graciousness. So at least take to certain traditions of being gracious. You see in India how people are gracious; you have been there now. They may be poor but how gracious they are. “It’s bad manners to say this. It’s bad manners to do that.” Here it’s very common. [Hindi] “I have no mangos, nothing. She asked me, “Have you got mangos? Have you got [masala]?” I said, “Nothing of the kind, I haven’t got anything.” [Hindi] diplomatic passport hai.

Sahaja Yogi: Barabar.

Shri Mataji: And they are not supposed to touch us. And she said, “No, but you are not here for diplomatic things.” So, first question she asked, she was with Me, she said, “Who is she to You? Why are you going together?” I said, “She is My friend.” She said, “What is your relationship? Where did you meet?” I said, “You are not supposed to ask all these questions [to, from] Me.” She said, “Now you open everything.” [Hindi] I told her also. She would not listen.

[Shri Mataji talking in Hindi with Sahaja Yogis]

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji I’ve been already instructing [Masha/Marshal] from the State Department [that have been here] today.

Shri Mataji: No, no, what I am saying, let him write also.

Sahaja Yogi: As well...

Shri Mataji: It’s very good. Because we can say she was my guest. She was coming...

Sahaja Yogi: And about that we want this person who spoke to You in such a way to be disciplined, and this will be the end of the matter. This is just informing them that things would be happening from above as we are phoning upwards. So, then we’ll be telling him that people will be contacted, You know, from the top downwards, just to let them know.

Shri Mataji: Should we do that much [unclear]?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji, yes.

Shri Mataji: Then she has no business to ask so many questions. When I said, “She is My friend.” “Now what is your relationship? Where did You meet her?” I said, “You are not supposed to ask all that. As long as I said she is My friend, all right.” She said, “I’m supposed to.” And she said, I said, “This is diplomatic.” She said,”Yes, but You have not come for diplomatic thing. So, I can see everything.” And she didn’t. You see what you should put in, that see didn’t see hers, so that racialism is a order to her head. She’s a racist, she was. There was no need for her to behave like this. Even she knew little bit of Hindi, I think, because an Indian man said, “She is a mad woman, you see, pagal hai.” She said “Pagal nahi hai”.

Sahaja Yogi: Ah! She said that?

Shri Mataji: And in Argentina [Hindi] ambassador [Hindi] “I’ll meet You outside as I’m going out.” He thought I’ll be just following him because he, too, had a passport and I had the same passport, diplomatic passport.

Sahaja yogi: [Hindi speaking about Americans].

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

Sahaja yogi: [Hindi]. The pilot came in. They harassed him right during the flight.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

Sahaja yogi: For six cans of milk that were going for emergency to feed some child in India.

Shri Mataji: But why?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, they, they think, You know if he is, late it was, what do you call, two shoulder bags, you know, one shoulder bag, regular shoulder bag, and this was additional bag which will inform them that there is an emergency.

Another Sahaja Yogi: Discretion [Hindi].

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] we have. That they cannot take over, you see. It’s an international law. And drug is different. I mean, I don’t look like a woman, a sixty-three-year-old woman, is she going carry drugs from London? I’m coming from London. Will I carry drugs from London to America? What is there to carry from London to America? Is going from America to London.

Sahaja Yogi: Right. You are right.

Shri Mataji: Nahin, nahin, aggression hai. [Hindi] she was very aggressive, that’s all. I mean, there should be same case behind it. I was coming from London. So why will I carry drug all the way from London to this place? From America, actually. America must be censured more. They are carrying AIDS all over.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, they are.

Shri Mataji: They are to be disinfected. Actually, they should be. In London, you know, AIDS has spread so much, so widely spread. [Hindi]. And they are all saying they went to America and that’s how they’ve got it. One fellow who came to America got it here. He went to Australia. We cured him, but again he got it back from another American woman there. So what are we to do now with these Americans also? They must be told that they should behave themselves. [Hindi] We cured him, Crosby. He says that that fellow was suffering from the same trouble and I went to see him. “But why did you see him? What was the need?” He said, “Because he was doing TM. I was also doing TM. I wanted to tell him about Sahaja Yoga.” Just imagine.

Sahaja Yogi: [Marathi]

Shri Mataji: [Marathi]

Sahaja Yogi: [Marathi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Mataji You are lawyer of lawyers because, you see, whenever he had any problem, I used to tell him [Hindi]. So, I always said that I don’t understand human laws. He said, “Then how do you know this?” [Hindi]. How to depend on anyone because she was so sincere and [he] would achieve everything. All their marriages, he got them registered, everything. Now I think we are going to also register our name as a religion in India, Vishwa Nirmala Dharma [Hindi]. So, would all the marriages that take place through this will be called [Hindi].

Sahaja Yogi: Instead of Arya Samajh Wedding.

Shri Mataji: Aaa?

Sahaja Yogi: Instead of Arya Samajh weddings we have Vishwa Nirmala Dharma weddings.

Shri Mataji: Vishwa Nirmala weddings. That’s it.

Shri Mataji: All right, ha. So, we call her Radhika. Here in the country of Shri Krishna we should call her Radhika. [Hindi]. Sometimes she does look like mother little bit; then again she goes back to her father’s face. But it was a miracle how Madhuri got married, you see and then how she came here. [Marathi]

Shri Mataji: So, you are working here as an architect now?

Sahaja Yogi: I have one more series of other exams before I’m licensed.

Shri Mataji: I see. But then you are not going to start a working with some firm or something?

Sahaja Yogi: I’m working with a firm now, Mother. I’m working as an architect but I don’t have a license.

Shri Mataji: I see. You see, we are thinking of starting a combined firm of international architects. So, you could be a member of that international architects, you see.

Sahaja Yogis: Oh, that’s nice.

Shri Mataji: So that all the architects, you see, exchange ideas among themselves about architecture and the beauty of international architecture because, you see, that’s architecture is also weighing on the minds of people very much. Like in Germany this Bauhaus; you must have heard about it.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: This movement started and they tried to neutralize all the beautiful things.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s awful.

Shri Mataji: And made it into very simple, drab houses, you see.

Sahaja Yogi: Stark.

Shri Mataji: Absolutely. And outside if you see, they look like prisons, absolutely like prisons. Horrible. Bauhaus. And now in Germany it so happened that they find the houses are very much needed. So, they have put all these houses on all the children’s parks and playgrounds and everything, and the schools are made of ten-storey schools and things like that. So, the children have no place to play. So, they are taking to drugs and very destructive and there’s no, it’s become horrid place now. So, we should do something about it, you see? We must know about the international architecture, how they work it out and then the ideas can be very helpful. We can integrate also. You haven’t received yet the brochure?

Sahaja Yogi: No, not yet Mother, not yet. I’ll phone Gavin and ask him.

Shri Mataji: Ha. What did he say?

Sahaja Yogi: No, no, I will, I’ll phone him. It’s just not been time.

Another Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]. Otherwise, she’s quiet. [Hindi]. You must give them a good massage before sleeping and then put some powder, clean their body and then they sleep very well. But give a nice massage to the children and put some ghee in the nose little bit and...

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi].

Shri Mataji: [Again] misguidance.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi].

Shri Mataji: Because, you see, they all parents suffer from liver trouble. So, they have allergies and they think that the oil gives you the allergy.

You must heat it up nicely, heat up the thing and then rub it. When it is rather cool then you can rub it. [Hindi]

Sahaja Yogini: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Ah, now, now you are all right. Ha?

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]. That’s the system we have. [Hindi] You see, we used to have a system that the mother also would be really rubbed off nicely with oil with very hefty women, you see, with very strong hands. But four, five women used to just rub the body. And then they would give you a dhuni from down below, you see, in a charcoal. [Hindi]

Sahaja Yogini: Charcoal.

Sahaja Yogi: Stool. [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: No, charcoal hai. [Hindi].

Sahaja Yogi: Stoolware.

Shri Mataji: Stool nahi.

Sahaja Yogi: [unclear, Hindi maybe]

Shri Mataji: Like a pot, you see, pot with holes. And the lady was asked to sit on that one and the, on the charcoal they would put this ajwain that smoke could come out and the lady was covered with a black blanket, like a tent, holding tight to share to bear all that, you see. And it was very good and I’ve gone through all that.

Sahaja Yogini: They used to stand. I always volunteered.

Shri Mataji: Yes, I’ve also gone through that.

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, marriages time. Those marriages in India. Here would be that time nothing.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]. They experiment on children. They experiment on everyone. [Hindi].

So, you like the name, Radhika.

Sahaja Yogini: [Hindi] Radhika.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]. So now ata kaya program hai?

Sahaja Yogi: Breakfast [unclear]. [Hindi] bhajan, Mother?

Shri Mataji: What is it? [Hindi]

[Shri Mataji and Sahaja Yogis are talking in Hindi.]

Sahaja Yogi: Sab ko dua dena [Hindi].

Shri Mataji: Kaun? You play that?

Sahaja Yogi: Sab ko dua dena harmonium. Oh, yea.

Shri Mataji: On the harmonium?

Sahaja Yogi: Don as well has done the [unclear].

Sahaja Yogi: Yaman Kalyan [Hindi].

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Yaman? Bhairavi, Anibhairava?

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, are va.

Shri Mataji: I taught them three ragas in Rome: Bhairavi and Bhairava and also Yaman. Let’s see. But we have got Phil, Phil, in Marie-Laure’s husband, you know. Marie-Laure. You know Marie-Laure? She is the sister of the Gregoire.

Sahaja Yogi: That’s Marie-Laure. Marie-Laure.

Shri Mataji: Ha, Marie-Laure. Her husband, he’s now become the master of harmonium. See, you must all the time play harmonium, you see, and try to find your own notes. Then it becomes automatically; you can play it. Not difficult. If you have one harmonium just go on playing on it. You see, you just try to find your tunes on the thing. You just learn it. He’s very good. You can do it, isn’t it? You’re doing very well now. Did you hear Phil playing on the harmonium? Phil?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, lovely, yes.

Shri Mataji: It catches every tune. That’s the sign.

[Shri Mataji and a Sahaja Yogini are talking in Hindi.]

[A Sahaja Yogi is explaining where he bought his harmonium. He is playing the beginning of Yaman raga.]

Shri Mataji: This is Yaman raga. In this only the Sa, Re, Ga, Ma; Ma means the fourth note. Fourth note only goes different. You see, that’s how. [Hindi]. This is simple. [Hindi]. This is Komal [flat]. This is what we see. Now here only the Ma, the fourth note changes which you can see now. The Sa, Re, Ga, Ma [Hindi]. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Ni, Ma.

Sahaja Yogi: This is dropped there.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Ma, see? Difference? The fourth note is only changed, only the fourth note.

[Shri Mataji and Sahaja Yogis are talking in Hindi.]

[Shri Mataji’s appreciation or commentary from time to time.]

Sahaja Yogi: And the meaning [Hindi]? "Guru daya sindhu" is, guru is all merciful.

Shri Mataji: Sindhu is the ocean. He’s the brother of all those who are downtrodden. He is the mother who gives you the second birth.

Sahaja Yogi: Rebirth.

Shri Mataji: Rebirth.

Sahaja Yogi: After the Kundalini is raised, soul realizes the rebirth; same thing.

Shri Mataji: Daata means the one who is the saviour. He’s the only saviour. There’s nobody greater relation than the guru. That’s the destination; guru is the destination. You have to reach to the quality of the guru, and he’s the one who gives you Moksha. So, arise the relation.

Sahaja Yogi: Once you get guru charan you don’t need anything else in the life.

Shri Mataji: Charan is the feet. Better tape it. [Hindi] Ah! Beautiful. See the vibrations. Just like Puja it is. The vibrations [that soothe you].

But this has been misused very much. It’s meant for the Sat gurus, the ones who give you Realization.

Sahaja Yogi: That’s right. Yes.

Shri Mataji: Who should talk of God, not those gurus which have come out calling themselves gurus. Sat guru.

Sahaja Yogi: That’s right, yes.

Shri Mataji: These should be the qualities in a guru. If they are not there, just is a money-making proposition. [Hindi].

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, [Marius’s] mother sent through me some "poa" for the baby. This the good time for you to receive this?

Shri Mataji: She has sent something for the baby. [Hindi]
