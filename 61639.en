Shri Mataji: Captivating the heart. All right.

Prada is like life for the swayambhu, Shumans, means swayambhu, all the swayambhus that are there, she is the life.

She is the one who has come out, which is born out of the flowers which are swept.

That she is worshipped by the Venus star, Venus star. You always see Venus there in the sky, wherever I am. And she remains in the star Venus and you know this is the star Venus and it's the Shukra here, at the centre heart, which we, which you call as Friday, we call it as Sukravan, is the day of the Goddess Sukravan. She is the spirit of the Venus star. Venus is here and on that resides the Jagadamba, so it is said like that. Now Venus is the star of chastity, isn't it? And the one who criticised chaste women, she is the one who destroys them, chastity. Anybody who is a critic of chastity, she destroys them. That too.

She is the destroyer of these two demons, called Shumbha and Nishumbha. She, she decides in the centre of every aura of the fire. Agni is fire. Mandala is the aura and in the Magyakar means in the centre.
