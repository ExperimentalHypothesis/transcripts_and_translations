First Public Program in Londo, England 01-01-1970

...this you must know that I will not tell whatever is not the truth, because I am not here for any political gain, of a commercial gain. No sir, I am here for your own gain, about genuineness. If you want to gain be genuine about that. 

Now see for yourself if this is the case or not. You can see with your naked eyes - these people have seen - the Kundalini pulsating. You can see it. It pulsates. When people touch my feet, in many cases, it pulsates. They have seen it. They are not all liars! And why should they lie? Nothing to gain: no money, first of all, that’s cut out. So what is the other thing?

This Kundalini rises, and you can see it’s rising, passes through all these chakras, and it stops at a place where you have a problem. The other day we had a very big man from somewhere who came to see me, and his Kundalini came up, and was just pulsating here like that. And the whole of this part was pulsating like that. I mean only that part. So the people asked him,  “Are you all right?” He said, “Yes, I’m all right.”  “But do you have a liver problem?”  “Yes, I have. How do you know?”  You can see it. Kundalini itself is suggesting. It’s pulsating. 

So you have to correct the liver, you have to correct the whole being. You have so many problems: physical, mental and emotional. But whatever may be the problem I have sorted them out: all permutations and combinations I have worked out now so that there is no permutation that now I can say is not worked out, except for one: that is the worst of all, is misidentification. 

If you carry on with misidentifications this cannot help you. You must know that you must identify with yourself and with nothing else; then only it works out. That is the only thing, is the misidentification with any untruth.  

Ask for the truth, and truth will be given to you. But ask for the truth. Not the ‘truth’ that you have made as truth. Truth is as it is: you cannot make the truth, you cannot give it a form. You cannot say, “This is the truth,” no! It is what is. You have to see it, you have be that, you have to appreciate it, you have to become that. 

Stupid people, how do they pass remarks at Christ? Even a person like Christ! Everybody has become so ego-oriented, I mean they think they have a right to criticise everyone. Christ is a person about whom you cannot think. 

For Sahaj Yogis I cannot challenge this one. They are realised-souls, [so] when they start thinking about Christ they become thoughtless. He is beyond thinking: how can you rationalise Him and bring Him to this level, and put Him to this level that you become a critic in the BBC, asking questions, “So how did You have Your resurrection?” How can you understand any of it? What do you know about Brahma? What do you know about the Divine working? What do you understand of His style of doing things? This little human mind can only become a drop in the ocean. It cannot understand the ocean and its work. This is the thing we have to realise. And once we realise that we are a part of this ocean, we become the ocean ourselves. 

But this is not lecturing — again I am telling you — it is a happening; you start feeling others immediately. When you are a drop outside the ocean, you do not feel what other drops are there in the ocean but once you jump into the ocean you start feeling everyone in your hands — absolutely, rationally, which can be understood — in the fingers, all the chakras flowing. 

Now this knowledge about Kundalini was not known even to the greatest sages, even to people like Narada it was not known. It was not needed at that time. The time had not come. 

You know when, say for example, electricity is not created, what’s the use of telling them about the switches? They were realised-souls, all right, they had vibrations, all right, but they did not know that, which is the chakras, and they catch, and these are the things that are missing, and this. They did not know. But I know. Some of them are really jealous of the modern people. They think, “What have these modern people done that they should get all this knowledge?” That they waited, is the main point. 

These people tried to show off so much: all right, go ahead! They are fixed up as some officers, somewhere in charge of this, and officers in charge. But they are not going to be the inheritance. 

For example all these people like Indra and the gods who are in charge of the weather, or all that, are settled down very nicely on the right side of God to arrange these things for you, like the caretaker of this place, but you are the people who are enjoying the fruits of it. What can we do? You waited, you’ve got it, and if you get it, that’s in your right. 

But this I do not, to pamper your ego, again please know that. Because, you have to get it, you have to settle. And the Self-knowledge is the thing where you are just in the centre, where neither you are in the ego nor in the superego, you are in the centre. And the space is created on your forehead, in the Sahasrara, if you see, when the Kundalini rises, the gap between this, the green gap, fills up through the Kundalini rising. She goes up, and opens this Sahasrara, which we call as baptism. And there on the top, you enter into that subtle awareness of collective consciousness. 

But as soon as your Kundalini crosses this chakra of Agnya, immediately you will become thoughtlessly aware: means you will be aware but there won’t be any thought, which is described by Jung. And what he has talked of collective consciousness, from where he gets the ideas of things that is the portion you reach — means it becomes your own nature. It is an actualisation, it is not talk. It is an actualisation. Your body becomes that. Like [from] a human being you become a superhuman being. From an animal to a human being there is definitely a difference in awareness. In the same way, there is a difference in the awareness of a man and a superman, but the only exception is that in your own consciousness you see it happening. It’s only the human beings who can see their evolution and not the animals, because you have been given freedom to see that. But the way the freedom has been used, you can write volumes on that; so better not go into that place! Let us forget about it. If we can do without going through the mistakes, if you can manage it, better do it! 

But if the mistakes are there we’ll face them all. I’m with you throughout, absolutely with you, and it should work out. 

Now if we say that, “This is wrong, we should not do this,” don’t get angry with me. For example the other day I told somebody that, “Drinks and alcohol goes against Sahaj.” He got very angry with it. I said, “Do you own a shop? Why are you angry with me?” I mean, it’s a simple thing I am telling you! Should I tell you, “You go and get drunk!” Should I tell you? Is it a good thing? “You can do anything with your sex,” should I tell you?  

Now you tell me one thing: in this whole world where you have all kinds of moralities so-called, where is a man crowned for drinking? In the whole world, tell me, any man crowned for drinking, getting drunk, or a statue erected in his name? Have you seen anyone?  Have you seen any man

being garlanded for being licentious and permissive? That means collectively human beings never accepted this kind of a nonsense, so far. I mean I don’t know, collectively [if] everybody becomes a satan then God alone knows! But even in the Roman Empire, when it was the worst of all at that time, it was not. 

So collectively human beings have always accepted holiness, righteousness, as a great thing. And even since today those people who lived in ordinary houses and huts are respected. And huge, big properties are made in their name, because that name itself gives them that power. But they are misusing it, they are insulting them, they are actually hurting the souls of all these great beings, such endless good. But what to do? Human beings do it for their selfish ends, they do it out of ignorance. If they do it out of ignorance it will be forgiven, everything will be forgiven, take it from me ,and you will be amazed how it works out. 

Now I would say, if you have any questions you better ask me, because I think still I have not been able to answer all your questions, despite I know what is in your mind. So if any one of you has any questions, please ask me before we start the programme. But not too much of it, because some are just there and if we ask funny, foolish, stupid questions, we are going to divert their attention. We have not achieved it, we are not there, we are still nervous, we are nowhere, so please don’t disturb others; that is important. If you are doing it only for me to explain everything, you do it. Otherwise you are  just try to show off. The other day somebody said, “In this book, this is written.” Now, am I going to answer for all the books that are written? No! Actually, I am not even a graduate. How much did Christ study? 

This is another knowledge I am talking about, so don’t waste your energy and my energy and everybody’s energy. And if you have come here to show off, I would request you go away, because this is not to show off but to show in. 

So, that way, do not try to play with yourself. Again and again I request. You have wasted a lot of your lives, and the time has come. And Gregoire says you are not the saints, but you all are saints, otherwise you would not be there, you’d be sitting in some discotheque; or if not there in some racecourse, somewhere there. But when you are here, you are saints. These are the saints who have the right to get it. But you have to be a saint: means you have to have seeking of the real type. If you are real and genuine it will happen and work out. 

I would like you to ask me questions if there is any explanation needed or anything which you...
