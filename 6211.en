To Honourable George W. BushPresident of the United States of AmericaWhite HouseWashington D:C:

Dear Mr President

I wanted to write to you earlier, but I felt that you were too busy with the crisis in your great country. All the while I have been watching you and your activities through television. I had conveyed to you earlier that I had a vision about you – it was that you would be the one chosen to destroy the evil of terrorism all over the world and completely redeem the world from the agony of satanic forces.Now you see, there are many persons talking of compassion and forgiveness – maybe out of fear or blindness. A sinner who asks for forgiveness can be forgiven, but not a devil, at any cost. In the Gita there is an answer given by Shri Krishna to Arjuna, his disciple. Arjuna was full of remorse and compassion, he puts down his bow and does not want to fight. He says to Lord Krishna “You have told me about the state where a spiritually equipped person should be a witness – stityaprAgnya”. Lord Krishna observed “A person in the witness state has no confusion at all and he has a clear mind. He develops the power and the will to destroy evil-doers – dushtakrutham”.

Lord Jesus Christ also hit with the hunter those who were doing business in the Temple of God. Lord Krishna asked Arjuna very emphatically to fight and destroy the evil so that the truth should prevail. This is a great message of Gita resounding all over the world, which has been tortured by the cowardly acts of the evil-doers.

Now in this Kali Yuga, you are the one chosen for this act of redemption from evil. All the spiritual beings of the past and present bless you with courage and power to destroy the cowards who have perpetrated this most heinous crime.

All the Sahaja Yogis all over the world convey to you the sincerest wishes for complete success in your noble and historic mission.May God bless you and the beloved people of America. May Truth succeed under your leadership.

With all my love and blessings.

Yours faithfully

Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
