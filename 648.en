[TAPE BEGINS WITH CHRISTMAS CAROLS SUNG BY THE YOGIS]

I wanted to be with you people in a Christmas day, but it never happened before. It has so chanced that I have to be here with you today and on the New Year. Something good has to happen I hope next year, some good luck has to come.

Christ’s work was very unique. [THE WHOLE THING or WORKING?] was a very unique thing, was planned in such a manner. [SOUND LIKE BECAUSE?] He was to be born in a place, it was very humble, very humble place. Because He came to teach us humility. The word ‘teaching’ in English language means telling about it, talking about it. But when I say ‘teach’ I mean create, you activate [THINGS or WITH HUMAN LIFE or HUMILITY?]

Actually He came, on this earth first of all, to create a space within us, at the Agnya chakra, by removing the hurdles of the ego, hurdles of the ego. He had to talk of humility that time, because Roman’s were ruling and they were very arrogant, very crude, uncouth, underdeveloped, we should say not at all evolved. Like, you can say some of the animals, which came, into being and were thrown out of the evolutionary process later on because they were useless, too aggressive or too big for their size or some sort of a thing like that.

In the same way Roman’s were. If you see their body, even now painted sometimes, you find that it was not like a human body, it was like some animals you see, the muscles and all that was very grotesque. There was no softness, no roundishness, on their faces. So, this ego of Roman’s affected everyone whom they ruled because when you have somebody as an ideal before you and always people see who dominates them and [THEY…del] such person becomes their ideal. So you start imbibing that kind of a character within yourself.

You see somebody who’s condescending, you also become suddenly condescending. You see somebody who is very egoistical and tries to show off, you also put [PUT?..del] up airs. You can see this everyday happening, that a boss comes in who is a very, very airy person, everybody in the office is like that. And that’s how Romans affected the people in those days by creating their own ideals, people thought they are the ideals, they are the best, because they had produced results according to them. They were so powerful, they thought this was the power. And that’s why they followed their methods many people who were not even Romans.

The another humbler group was affected because they were hurt, their ego was hurt. So they became equally violent in the sense that they were so touchy that you could not say anything to them, they would just come and [SOUNDS LIKE BARK?] you. Frightened people. This kind of character, is, very dangerous also, because that gives you some sort of very bad diseases can give you leprosy, people develop leprosy with that kind of character, if you develop a barking temperament of a nature by which you just jump at people. Nerves become absolutely sort of shattered [WITH or AWAY?] and the leprosy is the disease of the nerves.

Those people who always keep themselves under such strain and jump at every person who comes along are very dangerously placed as far as their nerves are concerned, and then a horrible type of virus you know that which creates leprosy attacks these nerves, can attack because they are very vulnerable, these kind of people who jump onto others. That’s why there was so much leprosy in that small little place there were so many lepers because their nerves were shattered.

In those circumstances, Christ was born. But He was not only born just for Romans or for anyone, but He was born for the whole world. Because ego had started growing in human beings at that time and had developed quite a lot as far as the Romans were concerned. And that demarcated the way human beings were going on. So they had to be controlled first of all, and Christ had to come at a time where a balance [SHRI MATAJI’S WORDS GET INTERRUPTED BY NOISE OF VIDEO CAMERA OR MICROPHONE] was to be established. So the first thing that was said about Christ throughout in all these music and songs you have heard now is that ‘Peace on Earth.’ He came to create peace on earth. That’s only possible when you are in balance, first of all, secondly when you are realized. Both things should be there. If only you get your realization and there is no balance in you, there cannot be peace. But peace never means in any way is a personality that recedes back, runs away from situations, escapists, which does not want to face the reality, never means that.

Christ is pictured very differently from what He was. He was the strongest personality [SHRI MATAJI’S WORDS GET INTERRUPTED BY NOISE OF VIDEO CAMERA OR MICROPHONE], the healthiest man [SOUNDS LIKE WHO HERE?] and He would not stand any nonsense, nobody could take liberties with Him. But He would not Himself take liberties with others, of course no question. Extremely compassionate, extremely kind but very powerful. This is the balance.

So He came on this earth to create peace within our minds. On this earth there is no peace, why? What’s wrong? It’s only the human beings are not peaceful. [SOUNDS LIKE WHEN IS THIS PEACE GOING TO BE SETTLED?] within yourself?

Who is violent? Human beings are violent to each other. Ego developed subtler ways and subtler ways, then provocative ways started coming up also from the superego. Sly methods from the superego.

The conflict started. And at that time to overcome that conflict, the best thing was to create a space in Agnya, in the center, in thoughtless awareness. That’s how Christ had to come on this earth.

The birth is very, very symbolic. Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya, He’s nothing but the Word as you call it, Logos, I don’t know what all words you have got in language.

The Shabda as they call it, the Aumkara was to be born in this way, because He had no body. And the subtlest of subtle He had to be. Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma, that’s why He was born like that.

It’s very poetic to see Him lying down in a manger for people, that look at the King of Heaven should [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS ASIDE].

So the, story of His birth was very interesting tale. [SOUNDS LIKE WAS A?] symbol that He came in a humble place, because people were so proud of their money, so arrogant because of their power that they had. Even today all the Christian nations are like that.

Surprisingly, Christian nations should be so arrogant and so power drunk and think no end of themselves because they’re afraid. Think of the Christian nations being very poor, do you think they would have had racial problem? They don’t have racial problems with Arabs. Not at all. As simple as that. No problem with Arabs. They have no race, Arabs have no race, they’ve money, money race. Those people who hanker after money are only bowing down to money. They have no respect for anything else but for money. Those who have money and think of money are another lot which is going to go out of [CIRC…del] the circulation of evolution. They are going out already.

The second lot is the one which was like Romans. They had a Paul, they all finished because they were power drunk. [IT…del] They drank away, their civilization completely finished off and they’re out. You’ve seen Portugal, you’ll be amazed, it’s happening there. The ego of Portuguese was so great you can’t believe that that country is a desolate country, there’s nothing now, big-big, huge big buildings which you see and you know they must have been rich once upon a time. And there’s nothing left with them except for their antique shops which are never open.

This kind of a ego is again revived and that revival came up, imagine in the name of Christ. Imagine. They purchased people to be converted as Christians. They [MO…del] gave them money, is all money, money propositions, money enterprises going on. Jews the same, then the Christians the same.

He was born in a manger. For a little child to be put in a manger by the Mahalakshmi, it’s too much. See how symbolic it is Mahalakshmi, it’s not Lakshmi, but Mahalakshmi to put the child in the manger, no place, we have at least Chelsham Road [YOGIS LAUGH], Warwick Road, Bramham Gardens, Brompton Square.

But the child was born and was put in the manger, the humblest thing in this world is a manger, the humblest of all, a crib, the highest is put in the manger. So, what do we do? We think we should also sleep in a manger, we become like Christ. There are people who believe in such nonsensical things. They think that, you see, if they have all the money, they drink and do all kinds of things you see. I met one man one day, was all drunk lying near a church saying: “I’m Christ, I’m Christ.” Must have got this idea that He’s lying there because He’s very humble. This kind of ridiculous caricature of the whole beautiful symbol is followed everywhere.

So the arrogant and the egotistical might say that: “Why, if He was the King, why was He born in the manger? Why was He kept in the manger?” Everybody will have their own concept. Even there are people in India, who are stupid people not wise, who say that He must have done lots of bad karmas to be born like that. Because to them, karmas give you more money. [INAUDIBLE] 

 

God is not so unintelligent. If you do good karmas you become men of God. You become seekers. You get the blessings of God by your good karmas. You become religious people. Not moneyed people who can go to pubs and waste their lives. This is the idea they have got that by doing good karmas you become rich, and become even worse for next life. Some people may believe like that. But He never did any karmas. He was in [A KARMA or INAKARMA?] Himself. So no question of His punishment and all that, [B…del] it was just a drama but very symbolic it is.

Now see, a little child put in the manger, no comfort, can there be a comfort in a manger? Think like that. All the Christian nations are after their comforts. Aren’t we? What we think is uncomfortable, should be comfortable. Christians should never seek comfort, that is one of the messages of Christ’s birth. If they seek comfort then they are away from Christ. Because He was born in a manger. No comfort was provided for Him. But that doesn’t mean that you should assume some sort of a funny habitation, it doesn’t mean that also, I mean I have to tell the other side of it you see. Copying Him is not the way. Is not the way by copying Him that you will become Christ but by imbibing His qualities within you.

I’ve known people who live in a pigsty but once they get to a better life they want everything else. So imbibing the quality of humility and adjustment. Humility and adjustment. Anywhere you’re put, anytime. Very particular about time, if somebody has to come at ten o’clock, and if he has to do a job, if [IT IS..del] he’s delayed by five minutes he starts breaking all the heavens, just can’t bear it, can’t bear it five minutes he has to wait, and if he has to wait ten minutes he’s out for a pub, finished, he cannot [BE..del] pacify himself unless and until he takes a drink This is the situation of a volcanic human mind.

So the peace has to come. How? If you seek comfort you’ll become lazy lumps. You’ll sleep off, you’ll be lotus-eaters, but if you [NOT?] seek comfort then peace will come. Because for our own comfort for our own selfish comfort of this body we torture everybody else.

The other day only I was telling that only in the western countries it is there, not in India. If somebody’s sleeping even till twelve o’clock you cannot wake up that person, is a irreligious act, I mean in India anybody who sleeps after six o’clock he’ll feel ashamed of himself to be sleeping that time, he’ll be apologetic the whole day and he’ll say that: “Oh, God, I’m sorry I slept.” It’s regarded as sinful to sleep so late as six o’clock in the morning. I mean any country like that.

So comfort has no end. There’s no end to it. Comfort crawls upon you, what is comfort? Let us see, very simple. In Christ’s symbolic life is very deep significance is this that comfort is nothing but the matter overpowering the Spirit. Do you see that point? If you’re sitting on a chair then you can’t sit on the ground. If you’re sitting on a sofa set you can’t sit on a chair. If you are sitting on a velvet then you cannot sit on an ordinary thing. Is the matter always over powering the Spirit and He was the Spirit, what does it matter to Him whether straw or anything?

It is insurmountable, nothing can displease the Spirit of these material things, [WITH THE MATTER OTHER WISE WILL TAKE AWAY or OVER?]. 

That is the thing is one has to understand that He was the Spirit and if you have to become the Spirit first of all try to give up your comforts, lash your bodies a little bit, I’m sorry on a Christmas day I have to say that, because He was also lashed that way. If you see on the day He was born, for a mother to put the child in a crib that was a manger is too much of a sacrifice. How much you want to do for your children, you see, dress them up properly, do this, do that. [IF?] The child was to be put in the manger, was put in the manger just for you people to learn that comfort crawls on the Spirit. We always seek the comfort. This one thing is a message to all of us. If you seek the [BATH..del] your room, “I must have a bathroom attached to that.” Again comfort. “What about my wife, where is she going to sleep?” She’ll sleep as others are sleeping. And you will sleep as [YOU, YOU ARE AS..del] others are sleeping.

Nobody is going to die, of that be sure, I can assure you. Sahaj Yoga is very hard thing that way you see, very few people die once they come to Sahaj Yoga [YOGIS LAUGH]. Some of them should. [YOGIS LAUGH MORE]. But they don’t, they continue, they go on giving realization, they go on doing everything, still they continue. Escape all the accidents, escape all the problems and they continue. But this is a short time, which must be used, it’s a very, very concrete thing I wanted to tell you today. It’s nice to talk of Christ’s birth, be happy about it, sing songs, go into a mood like that, but really I tell, you it’s a very symbolic thing for all of us to know that He slept, in a manger.

And the another symbolicism is that what did we offer Him? What did this world offer Him at that time? The another symbolicism is that they offered Him a manger. Are we going to do the same to our Mother? This is one thing one has to know. Manger is, after all is alright it doesn’t catches anything, it has no left Nabhi, right Nabhi, nothing, [YOGIS LAUGH]. It doesn’t have all these problems. There are no thorns, there’s no Agnya, there’s nobody screwing up into your stomach, suddenly feel, “oh God don’t want to see,” so you are the thistles in that manger which have to be soft to give comfort to Christ, you have to become so soft and so sweet, so clean and pure, because a new babe is going to be put in the manger. You are the kushas is the thistle. And for a yogi the kushasana is the one who sits on the kusha only.

So He was a yogi [He?] came on the kusha alright, but now what about you? To receive Him in the manger, this is the manger. The Mother is preparing the manger to make the child feel very happy and comforted, the thistles. Adamance, obstinacy, harshness, ugliness, all must be [BROKE or CUT or CURBED DOWN or WORKED OUT?]. It’s very symbolic, it’s very symbolic I must say His birth, why, why one should think why was He born like that? People might give any amount of interpretations, but I know because I’ve done it. I’m trying to soften you, I’m trying to mold you, sometimes I have to be harsh with you, sometimes I have to be angry with you, sometimes I have to tell you off, just now there are some who are catching so much on the Void, that My stomaching is screwing up. It’s alright with Me, cause I’m supposed to be that, I’m so fortunate that I have to face all that.

What about Christ within us? You’re not going to be happy with yourself, with your being, with your Spirit, unless and until you create a manger of very soft thistles. You yourself you’re not going to enjoy, you think that by justifying your egos, by justifying your arrogance, by justifying all that you are doing to each other, some people are busy making money out of Sahaj Yoga, some people are busy deceiving others, some are telling lies, some are creating problems, some are beating wives and some wives are provocating husbands, what is all this going on? We are creating a beautiful manger for Christ, to create the peace on earth. We have to be peaceful, to be peaceful one has to be humble, this is the message of Christ, humble. If you become humble peace will come. Humble is a good word, I don’t know if it explains what it means. Humble means not asking for your own comfort but comfort of others. When others are before you, that is humility, is not, “Thank you very much,” you kill somebody and then tell to the dead person, “I’m sorry I killed you,” finished. In English language is over, once you’ve said, “I’m sorry,” finished. “Yes, I know,” and the another is “I know.”

“Why did you do it? I know. Finished. If he knows then it’s alright. Then there’s no punishment. You don’t know, you are all Spirit, so beautiful, you are to be chiseled out, alright, that’s My job. You are to be cleaned out, that’s My job, alright, Kundalini awakening is My job, agreed, but maintenance, is yours.

On the contrary sometimes I feel, because I do all this, the maintenance, is [PO..del] very, very poor. Like in India I see some people try to help us, by giving us money you see. We didn’t earn the money ourselves, you see, somebody donated money and they built some wells, all are dilapidated and finished, free gift, nobody wants to look after it. It’s human nature.

If you don’t work hard for your maintenance, and just leave it to Mother, “Oh, She will cure us, let us continue what we want to do, She’s coming after all, She’s going to look after us, we’ll lag behind.” That’s why My presence can be sometimes in a way not so fruitful. My presence in England, is good up to a point, and afterwards it should not be there for sometime.

I love you very much you know that very much. [I..del] England is My heart, you have to be here, and this Christmas I wanted to celebrate with you and the New Year with you just out of My own desire, but I have to make you understand that you have to work harder and harder to keep yourself clean, get rid of your problems, come up, do not say, “That, yes, it is like this Mother.” All the time you are reporting to Me, “still Mother I’m catching, see now this is happening,” as if it’s a boastful thing to say. I will get alright, I have to be alright, now Mother has gone let Me show Her when I come back.

When I once went to Bombay, Raulbai did not come to see Me for seven days and she was in Bombay she had arrived to see Me. So I asked them, “What’s the matter, is she keeping alright is she alright? Then why didn’t she come to see Me?” I was thinking what’s the matter with her. She came to see Me after seven days, she said, “Mother I’m sorry I didn’t come to see You because I was caught up this time, I wanted to cleanse myself before showing My face to You.”

So, cleansing is to be done, maintenance is to be done, raising of the Kundalini, collectivity, collectivity, look after each other, you have to only support Sahaj Yogis and not others, outsiders, they are outsiders, they are not us, we are Sahaj Yogis, and those who try to support others are no more Sahaj Yogis, they get out of Sahaj Yoga would be better for us. Whatever we are, we are among ourselves, outsiders are outsiders, we have to love each other, we have to respect each other, as saints. Nobody has to say anything harsh [THINGS...del] to each other, no, be kind, loving, affectionate, curb down your tongues, be humble, humility, humility is the thing one has to be. Write it down with big words, be humble, be humble, be humble. And when you become humble, such peace will reign, and you will feel so nice, being humble, there’s nothing wrong.

Christ has gone to this extent to say that somebody slaps on this face you turn the other, be humble, with Romans there was no other way out, there was no other way out, also, He preached humility, throughout, He preached humility, you be humble to each other, that’s all. You need not be humble to others, because no one can now torture the saints, it’s over, that situation is over, but you be humble to each other. Humble in your demands of life.

That doesn’t mean that you should become people [ASIDE: JUST KEEP IT THERE...del] [AH..del] just that you become people of a strange characters, you see, that doesn’t mean that, should be decent with decorum, as Christ was when He was born. But you should be humble, try to mold your bodies, make them lighter in the sense that you can sit anywhere, you can move anywhere, you can lie everywhere, you are all young people, adjust yourself.

If somebody has one room you should say, “Alright, doesn’t matter, I can live in the corridor, don’t worry.” But, they will be first jumping, I’ve seen that, to the room which has the attached bath. How many of you have rooms with attached baths, let see? Raise the hands, living in the ashram. Better give up. Better give up. See now? Better give up. All of you give up your rooms and stay in rooms which are shared. Now it’s alright for you not to share because you’re husband and wife, but need not ask for attached bath.

Comforts, are to be given up for others, not for you, you should make others comfortable, not yourself. Sometimes I’m surprised at human beings how they allow others to eat anything, the way they are self-centered, it’s something surprising, but after Sahaj Yoga, you change, you enjoy giving comfort to others, saying comforting words to others, sweet things to others, you enjoy that. Christ was given the crib of a manger and He came to comfort you, to give you peace and He came as a Savior, can you imagine the contrast? You are the saviors of the whole universe now, as He was Savior. But, you cannot be selfish, you cannot be comfortable, you have to be like Christ, He used to live wherever He [LIKED?] lived in forest, He lived anywhere. Just working hard for people, He would never even have His food sometimes, He lived under all circumstances, under all conditions, He never asked for any comfort, nothing, He was a carpenter, He never even used a [USED A..del] glove. Here you must have gloves. You must have socks, you must have shoes, you must have a shaving this, He never shaved even, that doesn’t mean you grow your beard [YOGIS LAUGH], but He was a very clean person. He lived with a minimum of minimum, that’s what one has to do, is to reduce [?].

You know, I have everything that one can think of, but I can live with the minimum of minimum, I can live with two saris, and sometimes with one. You should be able to live with minimum of minimum, that’s the point is. And that is what one has to learn from His life is that we are the saviors today and savior lived just like a humble person, very elite in His behavior, very dignified, He was not behaving like a beggar going, “heh, heh, heh,” like that, some of them you are like that also, you go about like this, when you talk like this you go about [SHRI MATAJI MAKES HAND GESTURES LIKE A BEGGAR WOULD] that’s not the way, with dignity, with your magnificence, with your gravity, you move about, actually those who are really great, those who are the real emperors, do not need anything, [HAH?] what can dominate them, tell Me? If you are the emperor of this world, if you know you are the queen of this world, what is more important, what comfort can dominate? What material thing can charm, such a person, because that person is above, that’s badshah, that’s the king, that’s the real sign of a king, king of heaven, not of England, or of anyplace, but of heaven, and that’s what you are, you are the citizens of that kingdom, to you these things should be absolutely useless, the beauty of the matter should be seen, not the possession of it.

Beauty is the comfort, not what you feel in the body like, having comfortable things, beauty’s so comforting people do not know, how comforting is the beauty, and that I’m sure while we are celebrating His birth today, we glorify Him, by accepting a kind of a martyr Spirit, a Spirit in which you are dedicated, in which you do not demand anything, but you give, you do not ask for anything, but you give. Even today I received letter from people saying that, “please I want a job can you help Me, will You pray?” All sort of things like that. It can be any sort of nonsense [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]. Of course, I mean, one can have all that kind of thing, but ask for one and that is the Spirit, and once you ask for that, that’s the highest of all, you’ve asked for. Then you don’t want anything else, enjoyment is complete.

So to [TELI..del] celebrate His birthday and to rejoice in that is to rejoice in our adequacies, if you’re [ADEQUATE..del], adequate you do not hanker [AFTER YOU..del] after your inadequacies, don’t you? If you’re complete, if you’re full, if you are satisfied you do not hanker do you? So enjoy your adequacies, your completeness, your fullness, and your complete satisfaction, enjoy that. Ultimately, all these things lead to some sort of a satisfaction, of course, I don’t know if you get any satisfaction out of that, but the real satisfaction that is within you, is the Spirit, [YOU?] enjoy that. This is for yourself, and for others you are a comfort to others, it’s not that anybody who talks to you will come and complain that, “Mother, he has bitten me. I had a meeting with another scorpion, he bit me. I touched somebody and he hit me.”

Comfort, you’re a thing of comfort only, believe Me you are. Comfort. So those who comfort others do not bother about their comfort, the shepherds, simple people, in this cold, imagine they were outside and they saw the vision of the angel, it can only be seen by people who are humble, who are leading a humble life, He appeared to them and the another was vision to the wise.

So only the humble people and the wise people, wisdom, common sense and wisdom, those who are not wise can never understand Me, can never understand Me, those who are intelligent and intellectuals are not wise people at all, they’re stupid, you know that they’re stupid people. Wisdom. So the three wise men and the shepherd is another great symbolism, those who will understand Sahaj Yoga. Simple people. Shepherds. And another are the wise. Only the wise can understand the star. So many must have seen the star. Wise men from the east. It’s true. Eastern people are much more wiser than other people, no doubt about it. But why? Let’s see why they are wiser. Eastern, are wiser, up to a point.

In your body, there is east and west if you see. East is left side and west is right side. Eastern are the left sided, nearer the heart. But not the easternmost are Japanese, horrible people, Japanese horrible, then [THE...del] all these people who are selling you these drugs and all that, they’re worst of all, but those who know and are left-sided, the combination, of knowledge and love, knowledge and compassion, if there is no love, if there is no compassion, I mean you just can’t [SS..del] talk to that person, He’s like a stick, I mean in a dried stick what vibrations can I give you just tell Me? A dried stick straight forward dried stick you see. What vibrations I can give to a dried stick? There should be some sort of a greenery in it, isn’t it, little bit at least? If it is too much of water also it is spoiled, can be rotten, but if it is a dry stick straight forward, you know what I mean, dry sticks are, then how can you give vibrations to such a person? You cannot. You cannot [RAISE?] such a person.

So, first thing is love, and wisdom comes through love, wisdom doesn’t come through intelligence, it comes through love. When you love someone, you get the light of wisdom. By thinking you can never become wise, you can become stupid, absolutely stupid, but by loving you can become very wise. And I see Sahaj Yogis suddenly say something extremely wise, something great, suddenly, [THEY?] something they say so sweet and so nice, I said, “that’s it,” the heart is opened out, the fragrance of wisdom comes from the heart and that is symbolic, that three of them came, and they were who? Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha. They came to see Christ – Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha. See the vibrations. Because They only can recognize, not ordinary people, Romans, no. So They came. So we have to be humble and we have to be wise. Wisdom is such a [SUCH A..del] such a diamond, it has so many facets that I cannot describe to you in this short time, one day I’ll talk about wisdom.

But it’s all common sense, so sweet, so beautiful, where to say what, how to change the subject, where to assert more, where to handle the situation in a strong way, is to, where to be a gentleman and where to be uncouth, where to shout at people and where to be quiet and humble and sweet. All such a judgment you see, is all that is wisdom, you see, is a center of gravity, and to achieve that you have to give up your extreme behavior, obstinacy is the first thing to be given up, for all wisdom, obstinacy.

To have a son like Christ is such a great boon, I mean so confident you feel adhara, complete rapport is there, no problem of any kind, to have a son like Him, completely obedient, absolutely 100% obedience and humility and understanding of your being. No problems. You are all My sons too and made after Him, after the same pattern as I made Christ. I’m proud of you My children, come up to it, and you have an example already created for you, before you is Christ, see Him, what a support it was, I never had any complaints of any kind, no [UPSET?], He would never be upset, no question, He would never tell Me, “I’m upset,” never, this word doesn’t exist in the dictionary of wise. You are [NEV..del], how can you be upset, when you are set once for all. This word must go from the dictionary of many Sahaj Yogis who use it, problems and upset. You solve the problem, give the solutions. No problems, only solutions.

That’s the way a son should be to a mother, that she can depend on him, absolutely, no problems there, nothing, I mean you have a son born like Christ, what is there to worry about anything?

Even the one word He said: “Behold the Mother.” It’s a mantra. Is the greatest mantra that I use. When your attention is here and there I just say that mantra to you, as a command it is and so humble, so humble. Behold, ‘behold’ doesn’t mean look, no, it’s a very humble way of addressing, ‘behold,’ it’s something glorious, something great, behold it, accept it, understand, it was such a mutual understanding of support and love that should increase between us. No secretiveness, no formalities, no exclusiveness. No exclusiveness, all enjoyments must be together, now all your ideas of having separate enjoyments must be given up for a change.

Holiday is when you are in the company of your.. no more holidays.. Sahaj Yogis.. all these things must be given up. This is all against Christ’s behavior.

He never had a holiday, never, this is a holiday. Holiday comes from the word holy day, everyday that is spent, every minute that is spent in the company of Christ it’s a holy day. 

So they must have brought it down, Christ to Spirit and Spirit to spirits and spirits to other things. I’m sure [HE DID..del] I mean that way human beings are very great at deriving at right points you see and jumping into ditches directly, so they must have done it so sweetly, beautifully, that’s what it is wisdom, wisdom, all the time, wisdom.

Wise man is never cunning, never sharp, [IS..del] it’s something I cannot describe also. And who is the wisest of all is Shri Ganesha who is the embodiment of wisdom, ask Him for wisdom, He gives you the wisdom to do anything, ask Him for wisdom.

Today I just think of how many Christmas I must have passed I’ve never talked about Christ so much, with that intimacy, such a relationship, such a relationship of, so near and so far, because He knew who I was, that awe that respect, that humility, is hard to find in any disciple, even in a disciple in your own son, is so close, but complete understanding. That oneness has to be developed, gradually we are all developing it I know, but these are the days of speed and we have to speed up a little more in the right direction.

So now, as desired by you, we have a white Christmas outside [YOGIS LAUGH AND SHRI MATAJI SMILES] and as you have desired that “Wash Me and I shall be whiter than snow” is being blessed. Think of all the nice things we have done together and that we’re going to [GETHER...del] do it later on, that’s how you solve your past and future problem, and Christ came on this Earth to expand your present. So Christ who is the present Christ, today, who is born in you, is to be looked after, is not the Christ of the Bible, but a Christ of your heart, which is born within you is to be looked after.

Bible is so symbolic that is will take years and years for people to understand it it’s too symbolic, but, at least you can understand it, but other human beings cannot understand it, so one has to only understand through your own Spirit, that is the Christ born within you, which must be looked after, put Him in a very soft heart, if you have thistles, He’s a collective being, if you affect the collectivity, then He’s affected, look after Him.

So they say Merry Christmas is enjoyment for joy, out of peace comes the joy, light of joy, happiness, I wish peace for the whole world, the whole nation, to understand to give up all the strides, all the false battles, for money and for power, all wrong ideas that they are different from each other and come under the banner of Sahaj Yoga and enter into the Kingdom of God, where they’re invited with all respect and love.

I wish peace to all of them, to all the countries, all the human beings, in their families, in their hearts, with their children, with all of them, let there be peace, let their heart emit peace, their tongues speak with peace, their eyes see nothing but peace, all this has to change, tremendous change has to take place, the whole universe has to take a different turn, all that is hatred, hateful, ugly, has to vanish, and the peace has to prevail, which is not the peace of the dead but peace of the living, that has to come of the wise.

I bless all of you to be the channels of that peace, to be beautiful channels of that peace, to be glorious channels of that peace, to be great children of your Mother, who is so proud of you.

May God bless you.

There’s a mantra for the Goddess. Yah Devi sarva bhuteshu, shanti rupena samstitah. Oh Goddess who resides who all this creation, created, all that is created as peace. So you have to seek peace that is your Mother. We all say that mantra. Gavin you say it: Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu shanti rupena samstitah, namastasai, namastasai, namastasai, namo namaha. You say it once and then they should say it [SICE..del] thrice. Is a prayer.

 

[YOGIS TAKE THE MANTRA THREE TIMES]. [SHRI MATAJI DOES NAMASTE WITH HER HANDS]. 

And then another one is kshama rupena samstitah, this is the mantra because the peace can come only through humility and forgiveness, kshama, that’s why Christ is kshama. You say that for Christ.

 

[YOGIS TAKE THIS MANTRA THREE TIMES]. 

 

[SHRI MATAJI PUTS HER RIGHT AGNYA FINGER ON HER BINDI] 

Despite that Agnyas are catching. Now can you take out Agnya. Those who are feeling hurt please give up your Agnyas now, can you put your finger here for Agnya [SHRI MATAJI POINTS TO HER BINDI]. Here. Good for the Jews. [A YOGI PUTS THE AGNYA FINGER ON SHRI MATAJI’S AGNYA AND SHE HOLDS ON TO THE FINGER FOR A WHILE LONGER].

Hmm.. Better? So now all this is too much for Christmas, at the most you can wash My hands and this and [THAT?], let’s sing and you can handle the puja [SHRI MATAJI VOICES DRIFTS AWAY].

So, puja’s over, you can just wash My hands. [SHRI MATAJI TAKES OFF HER WATCH].

All these presents are to be opened near the tree or something, this is the tree, tree of life [?]. It’s the giver of everything, giver of all the gifts, it’s this tree of life, it’s the Kundalini, so symbolic you see? So symbolic. The egg of Easter, this tree of, I mean it’s so symbolic. I wish your Kundalinis were as beautiful as that tree. [YOGIS LAUGH]. Giver of all the gifts. It’s called as Kalpator, in Sanskrit.

Alright, so, we can do that [PORTION or WASHING?]

YOGI: Just taking water..

SHRI MATAJI: With the hands.

YOGI: He’s just bringing the water.

SHRI MATAJI: Is there a towel?

[SHRI MATAJI TAKES THE TOWEL AND PUTS IT ON HER LAP]. 

[PUJA CONTINUES].
