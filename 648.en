b'\nChristmas puja. Chelsham Road Ashram, London (UK), 25 December 1981.\n\n[TAPE BEGINS WITH CHRISTMAS CAROLS SUNG BY THE YOGIS]\n\nI wanted to be with you people on a Christmas day, but it never happened before. It has so chanced that I have to be here with you today and on the New Year. Something good has to happen I hope next year, some good luck has to come.\n\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s work was very unique. The whole thing was a very unique thing, was planned in such a manner that He was to be born in a place which was very humble, very humble place. Because He came to teach us humility. The word \xe2\x80\x98teaching\xe2\x80\x99 in English language means telling about it, talking about it. But when I say \xe2\x80\x98teach\xe2\x80\x99 I mean create, to activate this humility.\n\nActually He came on this earth first of all to create a space within us, at the Agnya chakra, by removing the hurdles of the ego, hurdles of the ego. He had to talk of humility that time, because Romans were ruling and they were very arrogant, very crude, uncouth, underdeveloped, we should say, not at all evolved. Like, you can say some of the animals, which came into being and were thrown out of the evolutionary process later on because they were useless, too aggressive or too big for their size or some sort of a thing like that.\n\nIn the same way Romans were. If you see their body, even now, painted sometimes, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that it was not like a human body, it was like some animals you see, the muscles and all that was very grotesque.\n\nThere was no softness, no roundishness, on their faces. So, this ego of Romans affected everyone whom they ruled because when you have somebody as an ideal before you, and always people see who dominates them, and then such a person becomes their ideal. So you start imbibing that kind of a character within yourself.\n\nYou see, somebody who is condescending, you also become suddenly condescending. You see somebody who is very egoistical and tries to show off, you also put up air. You can see this everyday happening, that a boss comes in who is a very, very airy person, everybody in the office is like that. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how Romans affected the people in those days by creating their own ideals, people thought they are the ideals, they are the best, because they had produced results according to them. They were so powerful, they thought this was the power. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why they followed their methods, many people who were not even Romans.\n\nThe another humbler group was affected because they were hurt, their ego was hurt.\n\nSo they became equally violent in the sense that they were so touchy that you could not say anything to them, they would just come and bark on you, frightened people.\n\nThis kind of character is very dangerous also, because that gives you some sort of very bad diseases: can give you leprosy, people develop leprosy with that kind of character, if you develop a barking temperament of a nature by which you just jump at people. Nerves become absolutely sort of shattered by it, and the leprosy is the disease of the nerves.\n\nThose people who always keep themselves under such strain and jump at every person who comes along are very dangerously placed as far as their nerves are concerned. And then a horrible type of virus you know that which creates leprosy attacks these nerves, can attack because they are very vulnerable, these kind of people who jump on the others. That\xe2\x80\x99s why there was so much leprosy, in that small little place there were so many lepers, because their nerves were shattered.\n\nIn those circumstances Christ was born. But He was not only born just for Romans or for anyone, but He was born for the whole world. Because ego had started growing in human beings at that time and had developed quite a lot as far as the Romans were concerned. And that demarcated the way human beings were going on. So they had to be controlled first of all, and Christ had to come at a time where a balance between ego and superego was to be established.\n\nSo the first thing that was said about Christ throughout in all these music and songs you have heard now is that \xe2\x80\x98Peace on Earth.\xe2\x80\x99 He came to create peace on earth. That\xe2\x80\x99s only possible when you are in balance, first of all, secondly when you are Realized. Both things should be there. If only you get your Realization and there is no balance in you, there cannot be peace. But peace never means in any way, is a personality that recedes back, runs away from situations, escapist, who does not want to face the reality - never means that.\n\nChrist is pictured very differently from what He was. He was the strongest personality you could think of, and the healthiest man you could think of. And He would not stand any nonsense, nobody could take liberties with Him.\n\nBut He would not Himself take liberties with others, of course no question. Extremely compassionate, extremely kind, but very powerful. This is the balance.\n\nSo He came on this earth to create peace within our minds. On this earth there is no peace, why? What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong? It\xe2\x80\x99s only the human beings are not peaceful. When this peace will be settled within yourself?\n\nWho is violent? Human beings are violent to each other. Ego developed subtler ways and subtler ways. Then, provocative ways started coming up also from the superego, sly methods from the superego.\n\nThe conflict started. And at that time, to overcome that conflict, the best thing was to create a space in Agnya, in the center, in thoughtless awareness. That\xe2\x80\x99s how Christ had to come on this earth.\n\nThe birth is very, very symbolic.\n\nBecause He\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but Chaitanya, He\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but the Word as you call it, Logos \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all words you have got in language, the Shabda, as they call it, is the Aumkara \xe2\x80\x93 He was to be born in this way, because He had no body, and the subtlest of subtle He had to be. Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma, that\xe2\x80\x99s why He was born like that.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s very poetic to see Him lying down in a manger, for people, that look at this: the King of Heaven should\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n[Shri Mataji: It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Now she does that to understand. (Shri Mataji drinks a cup of tea. To the little girl who wants again something:) Don\xe2\x80\x99t go near that.]\n\nSo the story of His birth was very interesting tale. It was very symbolic [unclear] that He came in a humble place, because people were so proud of their money, so arrogant because of their power that they had. Even today all the Christian nations are like that.\n\nSurprisingly, Christian nations should be so arrogant and so power-drunk and think no end of themselves because they are affluent.\n\nThink of the Christian nations being very poor, do you think they would have had racial problem? They don\xe2\x80\x99t have racial problems with Arabs. Not at all [laughter]. As simple as that. No problem with Arabs. They have no race, Arabs have no race, they have money, money race. Those people who hanker after money are only bowing down to money. They have no respect for anything else but for money. Those who have money and think of money are another lot which is going to go out of the circulation of evolution. They are going out already.\n\nThe second lot is the one which was like Romans. They had a fall, they were all finished because they were power-drunk. They drank away, their civilization completely finished off and they are out. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Portugal, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed, it\xe2\x80\x99s happening there. The ego of Portuguese was so great, you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that country is a desolate country, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing now, big-big, huge big buildings, which you see and you know they must have been rich once upon a time. And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing left with them except for their antique shops which are never open. [Laughter]\n\nThis kind of a ego is again revived and that revival came up, imagine, in the name of Christ. Imagine! They purchased people to be converted as Christians. They gave them money, is all money, money propositions, money enterprise going on. Jews the same, then the Christians the same.\n\nHe was born in a manger. For a little child to be put in a manger by the Mahalakshmi, it\xe2\x80\x99s too much. See how symbolic it is, Mahalakshmi, was not Lakshmi, but Mahalakshmi to put the child in the manger. No place. We have at least Chelsham Road [laughter], Warwick Road, Bramham Gardens, Brompton Square.\n\nBut the child was born and was put in the manger, the humblest thing in this world is a manger. The humblest of all, a crib, the Highest is put in the manger.\n\nSo, what do we do? We think we should also sleep in a manger, we\xe2\x80\x99ll become like Christ. There are people who believe in such nonsensical things. They think that, you see if they have all the money, they drink and do all kinds of things, you see - I met one man one day, he was all drunk lying near a church. He was saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Christ, I\xe2\x80\x99m Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d He must have had got this idea that he\xe2\x80\x99s lying there because he\xe2\x80\x99s very humble. This kind of ridiculous caricature of the whole beautiful symbol is followed everywhere.\n\nSo the arrogant and the egoistical might say that: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if He was the King, why was He born in the manger? Why was He kept in the manger?\xe2\x80\x9d. Everybody will have their own concept. Even there are people in India, who are stupid people, not wise, who say that He must have done lots of bad karmas to be born like that. Because to them, karmas give you more money, I mean, God is not so unintelligent.\n\nIf you do good karmas you become men of God, you become seekers. You get the blessings of God by your good karmas, you\xe2\x80\x99ll become religious people, not moneyed people who can go to pubs and waste their lives. This is the idea they have got that by doing good karmas you become rich, and become even worse for next life. Some people may believe like that. But He never did any karmas. He was in akarma Himself, so no question of His punishment and all that, because just a drama, but very symbolic it is.\n\nNow see, a little child put in the manger, no comfort. Can there be any comfort in a manger? Think like that.\n\nAll the Christian nations are after their comforts. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t we? What we think is not comfortable, it should be comfortable. Christians should never seek comfort, that is one of the messages of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s birth. If they seek comfort then they are away from Christ, because He was born in a manger. No comfort was provided for Him. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you should assume some sort of a funny habitation, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that also, I mean I have to tell the other side of it, you see. Copying Him is not the way, is not the way by copying Him that you will become Christ, but by imbibing His qualities within you.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve known people who live in a pigsty, but once they get to a better life they want everything else. So imbibing the quality of humility and adjustment.\n\nHumility and adjustment. Anywhere you are put, anytime. Very particular about time. If somebody has to come at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and if he has to do a job, if it is [that] he\xe2\x80\x99s delayed by five minutes, he starts breaking all the heavens, just can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it, he can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it, five minutes he has to wait. And if he has to wait ten minutes, he\xe2\x80\x99s out for a pub, finished. He cannot be pacifying himself unless and until he takes a drink. This is the situation of a volcanic human mind.\n\nSo the peace has to come. How? If you seek comfort you\xe2\x80\x99ll become lazy lumps. You\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep off, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be lotus-eaters.\n\nBut if you not seek comfort, then peace will come. Because for our own comfort, for our selfish comfort of this body we torture everybody else.\n\nThe other day only I was telling that only in the Western countries it is so, not in India. If somebody\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping even till twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock you cannot wake up that person, is a irreligious act. I mean in India anybody who sleeps after six o\xe2\x80\x99clock he\xe2\x80\x99ll feel ashamed of himself to be sleeping that time. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be apologetic the whole day and he\xe2\x80\x99ll say that, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, God, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I slept.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s regarded as sinful to sleep so late as six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. I mean, any country like that.\n\nSo comfort has no end. There\xe2\x80\x99s no end to it. Comfort crawls upon you, what is comfort? Let us see, very simple.\n\nIn Christ\xe2\x80\x99s symbolic life, its very deep significance is this: that comfort is nothing but the matter overpowering the Spirit.\n\nDo you see that point? If you are sitting on a chair, then you can\xe2\x80\x99t sit on the ground. If you are sitting on a sofa set you can\xe2\x80\x99t sit on a chair. If you are sitting on a velvet, then you cannot sit you know on an ordinary thing. Is the matter always overpowering the Spirit and He was the Spirit, what does it matter to Him? Whether straw or anything?\n\nIt is insurmountable, nothing can displease the Spirit of these material things, I mean the matter otherwise will take over.\n\nThat is the thing is one has to understand, that He was the Spirit and if you have to become the Spirit, first of all, try to give up your comforts, lash your bodies a little bit, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry on a Christmas day I have to say that, because He was also lashed that way. If you see on the day He was born, for a mother to put the child in a crib that was a manger is too much of a sacrifice.\n\nHow much you want to do for your children, you see, dress them up properly, do this, do that. But the child was to be put in a manger, was put in a manger, just for you people to learn that comfort crawls on the Spirit.\n\nWe always seek the comfort. This one thing is the message to all of us. If you seek your room, \xe2\x80\x9cI must have a bathroom attached to that.\xe2\x80\x9d Again comfort. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about my wife, where is she going to sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d She\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep as others are sleeping. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep as others are sleeping.\n\nNobody is going to die of that be sure, I can assure you. Sahaj Yoga is very hard thing that way you see, very few people die once they come to Sahaj Yoga [Laughter]. Some of them should. [Big laughter]. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t. [Big laughter]. They continue, they go on giving Realization, they go on doing everything, still they continue. Escape all the accidents, escape all the problems and they continue.\n\nBut this is a short time which must be used. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very, very concrete thing I wanted to tell you today. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to talk of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s birth, be happy about it, sing songs, go into a mood like that, but really I tell you, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very symbolic case for all of us to know that He slept in a manger.\n\nAnd the another symbolicism is that, what did we offer Him? What did this world offer Him at that time? The another symbolicism is that they offered Him a manger. Are we going to do the same to our Mother? This is one thing one has to know. Manger is, after all, is all right, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t catches anything, it has no left Nabhi, right Nabhi, nothing [Laughter].\n\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have all these problems. There are no thorns, there\xe2\x80\x99s no Agnya, there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody screwing up into Your stomach, suddenly feel, \xe2\x80\x9cOh God, don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSo you are the thistles in that manger which have to be soft to give comfort to Christ. You have to become so soft and so sweet, so clean and pure, because a new babe is going to be put in the manger. You are the kushas, is the thistle. And for a yogi the kushasana is the one who sits on the kusha only.\n\nSo He was a yogi, He came on the kusha, all right. But now, what about you? To receive Him in the manger, this is the manger. The Mother is preparing the manger to make the child feel very happy and comforted, the thistles.\n\nAdamance, obstinacy, harshness, ugliness: all must be curbed down. It\xe2\x80\x99s very symbolic, it\xe2\x80\x99s very symbolic I must say His birth; why, why, one should think, why was He born like that? People might give any amount of interpretations, but I know because I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to soften you, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to mold you, sometimes I have to be harsh with you. Sometimes I have to be angry with you, sometimes I have to tell you off. Just now there are some who are catching so much on the Void, that My stomach is screwing up. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right with Me, cause I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be that, I\xe2\x80\x99m so fortunate that I have to face all that.\n\nBut what about Christ within us? You are not going to be happy with yourself, with your being, with your Spirit, unless and until you create a manger of very soft thistles.\n\nYou yourself you are not going to enjoy. You think that by justifying your egos, by justifying your arrogance, by justifying all that you are doing to each other - some people are busy making money out of Sahaj Yoga, some people are busy deceiving others, some are telling lies, some are creating problems, some are beating wives and some wives are provocating husbands, what is all this going on?\n\nWe are creating a beautiful manger for Christ, to create the peace on earth. We have to be peaceful! To be peaceful one has to be humble, this is the message of Christ, humble. If you become humble, peace will come. Humble is a good word, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it explains what it means. Humble means: \xe2\x80\x9cNot asking for your own comfort, but comfort of others\xe2\x80\x9d. When others are before you, that is humility. It\xe2\x80\x99s not: \xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much.\xe2\x80\x9d You kill somebody and then tell to the dead person: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I killed you\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 finished. In English language is over [laughter]. Once you have said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d finished. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d and the another is \xe2\x80\x9cI know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x9d. Finished. If he knows, then it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s no punishment.\n\nNo. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, you are all the Spirit, so beautiful. You are to be chiseled out, all right, that\xe2\x80\x99s My job. You are to be cleaned out, that\xe2\x80\x99s My job, all right. Kundalini awakening is My job, agreed, but maintenance is yours.\n\nOn the contrary sometimes I feel, because I do all this, the maintenance is poor, very, very poor.\n\nLike in India I see some people try to help us, by giving us money, you see. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t earn the money ourselves, you see, somebody donated money and they built some wells, all are dilapidated and finished, free gift, nobody wants to look after it. It\xe2\x80\x99s human nature.\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t work hard for your maintenance, and just leave it to Mother, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, She will cure us, let us continue what we want to do, She\xe2\x80\x99s coming after all, She\xe2\x80\x99s going to look after us\xe2\x80\x9d, we\xe2\x80\x99ll lag behind. That\xe2\x80\x99s why My presence can be sometimes in a way not so fruitful. My presence in England is good up to a point, and afterwards it should not be there for some time.\n\nI love you very much, you know that, very much. I - England is My heart, and I have to be here, and this Christmas I wanted to celebrate with you and the New Year with you just out of My own desire.\n\nBut I have to make you understand that you have to work harder and harder to keep yourself clean. Get rid of your problems, come up, do not say that, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is like this Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d All the time you are reporting to Me, \xe2\x80\x9cStill Mother I\xe2\x80\x99m catching, see now this is happening,\xe2\x80\x9d as if it\xe2\x80\x99s a boastful thing to say. \xe2\x80\x9cI will get all right, I have to be all right, now Mother has gone, let Me show Her when I come back\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nWhen I once went to Bombay, Raulbai did not come to see Me for seven days and she was in Bombay, she had arrived to see Me. So I asked them, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, is she keeping all right, is she all right? Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she come to see Me?\xe2\x80\x9d I was thinking what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with her. She came to see Me after seven days. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to see You because I was caught up this time, I wanted to cleanse myself before showing My face to You.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, cleansing is to be done, maintenance is to be done, raising of the Kundalini, collectivity, collectivity: look after each other, you have to only support Sahaj Yogis and not others, outsiders, they are outsiders, they are not us, we are Sahaj Yogis, and those who try to support others are no more Sahaj Yogis, they get out of Sahaj Yoga would be better for us.\n\nWhatever we are, we are among ourselves. Outsiders are outsiders, we have to love each other, we have to respect each other as saints. Nobody has to say anything harsh things to each other. No. Be kind, loving, affectionate. Curb down your tongues, be humble. Humility, humility is the thing one has to be.\n\nWrite it down with big words, be humble, be humble, be humble. And when you become humble, such peace will reign, and you will feel so nice, being humble, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong.\n\nChrist has gone to this extent to say that somebody slaps on this face you turn the other. Be humble. With Romans there was no other way out. There was no other way out.\n\nAlso, He preached humility, throughout He preached humility. You be humble to each other, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. You need not be humble to others, because no one can now torture the saints, is over, that situation is over, but you be humble to each other. Humble in your demands of life.\n\nThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you should become people [Aside: Just keep it there.] Just that you become people of a strange characters, you see, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that, should be decent, with decorum, as Christ was when He was born. But you should be humble.\n\nTry to mould your bodies, make them lighter in the sense that you can sit anywhere, you can move anywhere, you can lie everywhere - you are all young people, adjust yourself.\n\nIf somebody has one room you should say, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, I can live in the corridor, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry.\xe2\x80\x9d But they will be first jumping, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that, to the room which has the attached bath. How many of you have rooms with attached baths, let\xe2\x80\x99s see? Raise the hands, living in the ashram.\n\nBetter give up. Better give up. See now? Better give up. All of you give up your rooms and stay in rooms which are shared. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s all right for you not to share because you are husband and wife, but need not ask for attached bath.\n\nComforts are to be given up for others, not for you. You should make others comfortable, not yourself. Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at human beings how they allow others to eat anything, the way they are self-centered is something surprising. But after Sahaj Yoga you change! You enjoy giving comfort to others, saying comforting words to others, sweet things to others, you enjoy that!\n\nChrist was given the crib of a manger and He came to comfort you, to give you peace and He came as a Saviour, can you imagine the contrast? You are the saviours of the whole universe now, as He was Saviour. But, you cannot be selfish, you cannot be comfortable. You have to be like Christ, He used to live wherever He liked: He lived in forest, He lived anywhere. Just working hard for people, He would never even have His food sometimes. He lived under all circumstances, under all conditions; He never asked for any comfort, nothing. He was a carpenter, He never even used a glove. Here you must have gloves. You must have socks, you must have shoes, you must have a shaving this, He never shaved even, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you grow your beard. [Laughter] But He was a very clean person. He lived with the minimum of minimum, that\xe2\x80\x99s what one has to do, is to reduce things.\n\nYou know, I have everything that one can think of, but I can live with the minimum of minimum, I can live with two saris, and sometimes with one. You should be able to live with minimum of minimum, that\xe2\x80\x99s the point is. And that is what one has to learn from His life is that we are the saviours today, and Saviour lived just like a humble person, very elite in His behavior, very dignified, He was not behaving like a beggar going, \xe2\x80\x9cheh, heh, heh,\xe2\x80\x9d like that.\n\nSome of them, you are like that also, you see, you go about like this, when you talk, like this you go about [Shri Mataji mimes a beggar] that\xe2\x80\x99s not the way! With dignity, with your magnificence, with your gravity, move about. Actually those who are really great, those who are the real emperors, do not need anything. Ah, what can dominate them, tell Me? If you are the emperor of this world, if you know you are the queen of this world, what is more important, what comfort can dominate?\n\nWhat material thing can charm such a person? Because that person is above, that\xe2\x80\x99s badshah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the king, that\xe2\x80\x99s the real sign of a king, king of heaven, not of England, or of any place, but of heaven. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what you are, you are the citizens of that kingdom, to you these things should be absolutely useless.\n\nThe beauty of the matter should be seen, not the possession of it.\n\nBeauty is the comfort, not what you feel in the body, like having comfortable things. Beauty is so comforting, people do not know how comforting is the beauty. And that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure while we are celebrating His birth today, we glorify Him, by accepting a kind of a martyr Spirit, a Spirit in which you are dedicated, in which you do not demand anything, but you give. You do not ask for anything, but you give.\n\nEven today I received letter from people saying that: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, I want a job, can you help Me, will You bring?\xe2\x80\x9d. All sort of things like that. [Shri Mataji laughs]. It can be any sort of a nonsense. Of course, I mean, one can have all that kind of thing, but ask for one and that is the Spirit. And once you ask for that, nothing higher to what you have asked for [unclear]. Then you don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything else, the enjoyment is complete.\n\nSo to celebrate His birthday and to rejoice in that, is to rejoice in our adequacies. If you are adequate you do not hanker after your inadequacies, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? If you are complete, if you are full, if you are satisfied you do not hanker, do you? So enjoy your adequacies, your completeness, your fullness, and your complete satisfaction, enjoy that.\n\nUltimately, all these things lead to some sort of a satisfaction. Of course, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you get any satisfaction out of that, but the real satisfaction that is within you is the Spirit, you enjoy that. This is for yourself, and for others you are a comforter to others. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that anybody who talks to you will come and complain to Me: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, he has bitten me. I had a meeting with another scorpion, he bit me [laughter]. I touched somebody and he hit me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nComfort. You are a thing of comfort to others, believe Me, you are. Comfort others. So those who comfort others do not bother about their comfort. The shepherds, simple people, in this cold, imagine they were outside, and they saw the vision of the angel. It can only be seen by people who are humble, who are leading a humble life, He appeared to them and the another was, vision, to the Wise.\n\nSo only the humble people and the wise people - wisdom, common sense and wisdom. Those who are not wise can never understand, can never understand, those who are intelligent and intellectuals are not wise people at all, they are stupid, you know that they are stupid people. Wisdom. So the three wise men and the shepherd is another great symbolism, those who will understand Sahaja Yoga - simple people, shepherds. And another are the wise.\n\nOnly the wise can understand the star. So many must have seen the star. Wise men from the East. It\xe2\x80\x99s true. Eastern people are much more wiser than other people, no doubt about it. But why? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see why they are wiser. Eastern are wiser, up to a point.\n\nIn your body, there is East and West if you see. East is left side and West is right side. Eastern are the left sided, nearer the heart.\n\nBut not the Eastern most are Japanese, horrible people, Japanese, horrible, then the - all these people who are selling you these drugs and all that, they are worst of all.\n\nBut those who know and are left-sided, the combination of knowledge and love, knowledge and compassion. If there is no love, if there is no compassion, I mean, you just can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to that person. He\xe2\x80\x99s like a stick! I mean, in a dried stick what vibrations can I give, you just tell Me? A dried stick, straightforward dried stick, you see. What vibrations I can give to a dried stick? There should be some sort of a greenery in it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Little bit at least.\n\nIf it is too much of water also it is spoiled, can be rotten. But if it is a dry stick straightforward, you know what I mean, dry sticks are - then how can you give vibrations to such a person? You cannot. You cannot raise such a person.\n\nSo, first thing is love, and wisdom comes through love. Wisdom doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come through intelligence, it comes through love. When you love someone, you get the light of wisdom.\n\nBy thinking you can never become wise, you can become stupid, absolutely stupid, but by loving you can become very wise.\n\nThen I see Sahaj Yogis suddenly say some things extremely wise, something great, suddenly they say something that\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet and so nice, I said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, the heart has opened out\xe2\x80\x9d. The fragrance of wisdom comes from the heart and that is symbolic now, that three of them came, and they were who?\n\nBrahma, Vishnu, Mahesha. They came to see Christ \xe2\x80\x93 Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha. See the vibrations. Because They only can recognize, not ordinary people, Romans, no. So They came.\n\nSo we have to be humble and we have to be wise. Wisdom is such a, such a diamond, it has so many facets that I cannot describe to you in a short time, one day I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about wisdom.\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s all common sense, so sweet, so beautiful, where to say what, how to change the subject, where to assert more, where to handle a situation in a strong way, is to, where to be a gentleman and where to be uncouth, where to shout at people and where to be quiet and humble and sweet. All such a judgment you see, is all that is wisdom, you see. Is a center of gravity, and to achieve that you have to give up your extreme behavior. Obstinacy is the first thing that should be given up, for all wisdom, obstinacy.\n\nTo have a son like Christ was such a great boon, I mean, so confident You know, feel, \xe2\x80\x9cadhara\xe2\x80\x9d, the complete rapport is there, no problem of any kind, to have a son like Him, completely obedient, absolutely 100% obedience and humility and understanding of Your Being. No problems. You are all My sons too, and made after Him, after the same pattern as I made Christ. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you, you are My children, come up to it, and you have an example already created for you. Before you is Christ, you see Him, what a support it was, I never had any complaints of any kind, no upset, He would never be upset, no question! He would never tell Me, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m upset,\xe2\x80\x9d never, this word doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in the dictionary of wise. You are never - how can you be upset, when you are set once for all? This word must go from the dictionary of many Sahaj Yogis who use it, problems and upset.\n\nYou solve the problem, give the solutions. No problems, only solutions.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way a son should be to a mother, that she can depend on him, absolutely, no problems there, nothing, I mean, you have a son born like Christ, what is there to worry about anything?\n\nEven the one word He said: \xe2\x80\x9cBehold the Mother\xe2\x80\x9d, is a mantra, is the greatest mantra that I use. When your attention is here and there, I just say that mantra to you, as a command it is! And so humble, so confident: \xe2\x80\x9cBehold\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cBehold\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean look, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very humble way of addressing, \xe2\x80\x98behold,\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s something glorious, something great, behold it, accept it, understand. It was such a mutual understanding of support and love that should exist between us. No secretiveness, no formalities, no exclusiveness. No exclusiveness, all enjoyments must be together.\n\nNow all your ideas of having separate enjoyments must be given up for a change.\n\nHoliday is when you are in the company of your, no more holidays, Sahaj Yogis. All these things must be given up. This is all against Christ\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\n\nHe never had a holiday, never. This is holidaying. Holiday comes from the word holy day. Every day that is spent, every minute that is spent in the company of Christ is a holy day.\n\nSo they must have brought it down, Christ to Spirit and Spirit to spirits and spirits to other things. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\n\nI mean, that way, human beings are very great at deriving at right points, you see, and jumping into ditches directly. So they must have done it so sweetly, beautifully, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is wisdom, wisdom, all the time, wisdom.\n\nWise man is never cunning, never sharp. Is something I cannot describe also. And who is the wisest of all is Shri Ganesha, who is the embodiment of wisdom. Ask Him for wisdom. He gives you the wisdom to do anything, ask Him for wisdom.\n\nToday I just think of how many Christmas I must have passed, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never talked about Christ so much, with that intimacy. Such a relationship, such a relationship of, so near and so far - because He knew who I was.\n\nThat awe, that respect, that humility, is hard to find in any disciple, even in a disciple, in your own son! Is so close, but complete understanding.\n\nThat oneness has to be developed. Gradually we are all developing it, I know, but these are the days of speed and we have to speed up a little more in the right direction.\n\nSo now, as desired by you, we have a white Christmas outside [Shri Mataji smiles; laughter. Some yogis say: \xe2\x80\x9cJai Shri Mataji\xe2\x80\x9d]. Then as you have desired that \xe2\x80\x9cWash me and I shall be whiter than snow\xe2\x80\x9d is been blessed, think of all the nice things we have done together and that we are going together to do it later on: that\xe2\x80\x99s how you solve your past and future problem. And Christ came on this Earth to expand your present. So Christ who is the present Christ, today, who is born in you, is to be looked after. He\xe2\x80\x99s not the Christ of the Bible, but the Christ of your heart, which is born within you is to be looked after.\n\nBible is so symbolic that it will take years and years for people to understand it, it\xe2\x80\x99s too symbolic. But at least you can understand it, but other human beings cannot understand.\n\nSo one has to only understand through your own Spirit, that is the Christ born within you, which must be looked after. Put Him in a very soft heart, if you have thistles, He\xe2\x80\x99s a collective being. If you affect the collectivity, then He\xe2\x80\x99s affected. Look after Him.\n\nSo they say Merry Christmas is enjoyment for joy. Out of peace comes the joy, light of joy, happiness.\n\nI wish peace for the whole world, for the whole nations, to understand to give up all the strives, all the false battles, for money and for power, all wrong ideas that they are different from each other, and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga and enter into the Kingdom of God, where they are invited with all respect and love.\n\nI wish peace to all of them, to all the countries, all the human beings, in their families, in their hearts, with their children. With all of them, let there be peace, let their heart emit peace, their tongues speak with peace, their eyes see nothing but peace.\n\nAll this has to change, tremendous change has to take place, the whole universe has to take a different turn. All that is hatred, hateful, ugly, has to vanish, and the peace has to prevail, which is not the peace of the dead but peace of the living, that has to come, of the wise.\n\nI bless all of you to be the channels of that peace, to be beautiful channels of that peace, to be glorious channels of that peace, to be great children of your Mother, who is so proud of you.\n\nMay God bless you.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a mantra for the Goddess: \xe2\x80\x9cYa Devi sarva bhuteshu, shanti rupena samsthita\xe2\x80\x9d. Oh Goddess who resides through all this creation created, all that is created, as peace. So you have to seek peace that is your Mother.\n\nWe all say that mantra. Gavin, you say it: \xe2\x80\x9cYa Devi sarva bhuteshu shanti rupena samsthita, namastasye, namastasye, namastasye, namoh namaha.\xe2\x80\x9d You say it once and then they should say it thrice. It\xe2\x80\x99s a prayer.\n\nGavin with sahaja yogis: \xe2\x80\x9cYa Devi sarva bhuteshu, shanti rupena samsthita, namastasye, namastasye, namastasye, namoh namaha.\xe2\x80\x9d [Three times] [Shri Mataji does \xe2\x80\x98namaste\xe2\x80\x99].\n\nAnd then another one is kshama rupena samsthita, this is the mantra because the peace can come only through humility and forgiveness, \xe2\x80\x9ckshama\xe2\x80\x9d. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Christ is kshama. You say that for Christ.\n\nSahaja Yogis: \xe2\x80\x9cYa Devi sarva bhuteshu, kshama rupena samsthita, namastasye, namastasye, namastasye, namoh namaha.\xe2\x80\x9d [Three times].\n\n[Shri Mataji puts Her right Agnya finger on Her bindi]\n\nDespite that, Agnyas are catching.\n\nNow can you take out Agnya? Those who are feeling hurt, please give up your Agnyas now, can you put your finger here for Agnya?\n\n[Shri Mataji points to Her bindi].\n\nHere. Good for the Jews.\n\n[A Yogi puts the Agnya finger on Shri Mataji\xe2\x80\x99s Agnya and She holds on to the finger for a while longer].\n\nHmm. Better? So now all this is too much for Christmas, at the most you can wash My hands and this and that, you can sing something and you can have little puja, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\n\nFor Me the puja is over, if you can get a\xe2\x80\xa6 you could just wash My hands [and that\xe2\x80\x99s it? Not clearly audible]. [Shri Mataji takes off Her watch]. \n\nNow. All these presents are to be opened near the tree or something, this is the tree, tree of life. Present. Is giver of everything, giver of all the gifts, is this tree of life, is the Kundalini, so symbolic, you see? So symbolic.\n\nThe egg of Easter, this tree of, I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s so symbolic. I wish your Kundalinis were as beautiful as that tree. [Yogis laugh].\n\nGiver of all the gifts. Is called as Kalpataru, in Sanskrit.\n\nAlright, so, we can do that washing \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nGavin: Just getting water.\n\nShri Mataji: Of the hands.\n\nSahaja Yogi: He\xe2\x80\x99s just bringing the water.\n\nShri Mataji: Is there a towel, or\xe2\x80\xa6?\n\n[Shri Mataji puts the towel on Her lap].\n\n[Video interruption. Puja continues with the washing of Hands].\n\nShri Mataji: \xe2\x80\xa6 way, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I mean, if you tell somebody \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put your fingers there\xe2\x80\x9d, they won\xe2\x80\x99t listen. But once it is burnt, then they know, wisdom comes in, through experience. But now [they don\xe2\x80\x99t have?] innate. [Unclear]\n\n[Aside to Gavin] Yes, just wash first of all. [Hands are washed] \n\nLook at that. [Shri Mataji looks and puts Her hand into the water used to wash Her Hands] Hm. Ganges.\n\nRiver Thames has behaved so far, so far.\n\nI hope so, she behaves even when I go away.\n\nShould we put it somewhere? [Yogi: Put it in that\xe2\x80\xa6] She was very furious, you know? Very furious she was. She is a standing danger. I must say. For the sinful, be careful.\n\nAll the polish of the house and everything like that [She laughs]. Today I was polishing symbolically. [She laughs] Ah, now. First of all we\xe2\x80\x99ll wash and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, all right? All right. Bring it, the\xe2\x80\xa6 no, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll have now the ghee.\n\nShould take this quite a lot, keep it with them and take it at least seven days, as a medicine. This is very good. For all those who have Void problems, specially for [voiders?].\n\nLinda, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have time now, once this is over then you can come and see Me, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss about other things, all right?\n\nNow, what should we do?\n\nGavin: He\xe2\x80\x99s just getting ghee now. It\xe2\x80\x99s been warmed.\n\nShri Mataji: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for Aarti and all that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring this time when I go there. If I save some money [She laughs]. Yes.\n\nYou know, the letter was not shown to Modi [She laughs, Gavin laughs]. Letter you give up [She laughs].\n\nThis is ghee?\n\nYogini: Yes, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: This is ghee! So much!\n\nOut of proportion it is, I mean. [Laughter] It\xe2\x80\x99s too much softening [laughter]. All right, give Me little bit now, some. Just a wee bit. As it is you all have liver, so you don\xe2\x80\x99t need ghee. [Ghee is poured on Shri Mataji\xe2\x80\x99s hands] \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Now pour some water. Good for cleaning the nose of all the people who have sinus\xe2\x80\xa6 [She laughs, inaudible words] the ghee, but not for eating, eh?\n\nNow. Little bit now of another thing, whatever it is [Yoghurt is offered on Her Hands.] Put the whole thing.\n\nAgain some water. Now. Milk has to be more. Madhu, madhu, you get madhu first, madhu means\xe2\x80\xa6 Milk will be more than this. [Honey is poured onto Her hands] Yes.\n\nGavin: Shall I put milk next?\n\nShri Mataji: Yes, milk, then. And more milk than\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nGavin: \xe2\x80\xa6sugar.\n\nShri Mataji: Yes.\n\nMilk. Need for more milk, I think. More. Here. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\n\n[Sugar is poured] Not too much sugar.\n\nNot to feel guilty, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Not to feel guilty at all, left - left [She raises left index finger] Vishuddhi catching.\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t think! In My presence you are not supposed to think at all. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t think. Don\xe2\x80\x99t feel guilty. [She raises left index finger] Catching, still.\n\n[Aside] Good, thank you.\n\n[Video interruption. Then Shri Mataji is holding a small girl in Her lap. Yogis laugh. Shri Mataji cuddling the child]\n\nYogi: She\xe2\x80\x99s posing!\n\nShri Mataji: She\xe2\x80\x99s posing! [Shri Mataji laughs] Look at her. Wrapped up in the sari. Fitting in great, herself [unclear].\n\nGavin: Just matches her eyes.\n\nShri Mataji: Eh?\n\nGavin: The sari just matches her eyes.\n\nShri Mataji: You see? Just see [indistinct words]. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dignified thing, you know, sari is very dignified. Now. All right. [The small child gets off Her lap].\n\nVery nice people. Very sensible.\n\nGavin, in your list you must put this also. If you tell this list to Me, there, who is coming gives you. Who are coming to India out of you? Here? Now, those who are coming should get this list of a few things that you need, essential ones.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t find that thing with which you used to give Me water, is it here or not? With the spoon and all that.\n\nGavin: I must check it with Marcus afterwards.\n\nShri Mataji: Marcus?\n\nMarcus: Yes, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: You\xe2\x80\x99ve got that spoon and\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nMarcus: Yes, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: That you have got.\n\nMarcus: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: All right [speaks aside in a low voice. Sounds like: there\xe2\x80\x99s the spoon]. This one is very good because it is not hard wood.\n\n[After the decoration of the Devi, Shri Mataji sits with Her left hand upward and Her right hand raised in blessing] \n\nYogi: Christmas\xe2\x80\xa6 [indistinct].\n\nShri Mataji: Now, just put some red on my hand. Red [Kumkum? Unclear]\n\n[Video interruption]\n\nShri Mataji: I will.\n\nGavin: Our Mother, You are the Counsellor who was promised by Christ.\n\nShri Mataji: I am.\n\nGavin: You make us become our own knowledge.\n\nOur Mother, You are the Redeemer, who was promised by Christ. You have given us our second birth.\n\nOur Mother, You are the fulfillment of every prophecy and every prayer.\n\nOur Mother, You are the wholesomeness, by which all wrongs are cleansed.\n\nOur Mother, You are the right discrimination, by which we have received enlightenment.\n\nOur Mother, You are the integration, by You God\xe2\x80\x99s whole creation has been threaded together. We bow to You who are auspiciousness; we praise You who are Love; we give thanks to You who are compassion; we prostrate before You who are all-knowing, all-seeing and all-forgiving. We are Your children: let us never be separated from You, whether by Your illusion, or by our own limitations. Give us strength of Spirit and to the world give peace. Aum.\n\nYogis: Amen.\n\nShri Mataji: Let your life be fragrant by My blessings, by My love, by My concern, and the pride that I have for you all.\n\nMay God bless you.\n\n[Video interruption. Then a yogini presents her song to Shri Mataji.]\n\nYogini: \xe2\x80\xa6 and it\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cMother God\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nShri Mataji: Who?\n\nYogini: It\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cMother God\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nShri Mataji: \xe2\x80\x9cMother God\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nYogini: \xe2\x80\x9cMother God\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n[Yogini sings.]\n\nShri Mataji: Oh. [Applause]. Sang [you?] with such a heart. Everybody was, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s heart was singing with you. Thank you very much. May God bless you.\n\nThese songs should be recorded and should be sent to India. They would be very happy, you see, to have these songs. Very beautiful. Who wrote it?\n\nYogini: Hugo wrote it, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Eh?\n\nYogini: Hugo wrote it.\n\nShri Mataji: Hugo.\n\nYogini: Hugo did that.\n\nShri Mataji: Congratulations. Give him a hand.\n\n[Applause of Shri Mataji and yogis]\n\nBeautiful. Integration is so important, you see. Somebody has to write, somebody has to compose, somebody has to sing and somebody has to listen.\n\n[Laughter]\n\n[End of video]\n\nH.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi\n'
