b'Public Program Day 2, Munich, Germany, 12 July 1988\n\n(Yogi talks in German)\nI bow to all the seekers of truth.\nAs I told you yesterday, that truth is what it is and we have to keep our mind open as scientists to see what is the truth. We cannot organize the truth, and we cannot change the truth, and we cannot ourselves create the truth. So what we can do is to know the truth, to become the truth, and to enjoy the truth.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s very abstract if I talk of truth. But how do we know truth normally? Is through our sense organs. Like, you see all these flowers, and you see through your eyes these are flowers, and you know it is the flowers. Anything that you hear, all of you hear the same thing, and you know that\xe2\x80\x99s what is the truth what you are hearing.\nNow, you can feel something hot or cold with your fingertips. And whatever you can feel with your fingertips is the truth that you know. But in darkness, if you are holding the snake in your hand and somebody says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are holding the snake,\xe2\x80\x9d you can always say that \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a rope, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the snake.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo, to know that, you have to have the light.\nIn human evolution, we have known many more things than the animals have known. For example, if you take a dog or a horse through a dirty lane, he won\xe2\x80\x99t feel the filth, he won\xe2\x80\x99t have any bad smells, he\xe2\x80\x99ll just pass through. But we cannot. In the same way, we can understand aesthetics, which a dog cannot understand. We can understand who are the painters and who are better painters \xe2\x80\x94 everything we understand with our understanding of the art and music, which is only a human quality.\nBut actually in this area a confusion starts. Some people might say that it\xe2\x80\x99s a good\xe2\x80\xa6 good music, some will say it\xe2\x80\x99s not good, somebody will say it\xe2\x80\x99s bad. At this stage, the ego starts deciding: \xe2\x80\x9cI like this. I like that. I like that.\xe2\x80\x9d So this ego creates a problem between us and the truth.\nAs shown in this picture, the ego is the yellow part on our head. We have given it the colour of the bile.\nYOGINI: Excuse me, Mother?\nShri Mataji: Bile. Of the bile.\nWhen you have too much bile, then ego starts bubbling more. That means with the overactivity of the liver you get your ego overdeveloped. Yesterday I told you about the cancer disease, but today I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how much this horrible liver can cost us trouble.\nActually, when you think too much, then your grey cells are to be transformed \xe2\x80\x94 or could be replaced \xe2\x80\x94 only by this Swadhishthana Chakra, which is on\xe2\x80\xa6 working more on the Sun line. And the Swadhishthana is put to too much strain, and it neglects your liver, it neglects your pancreas, neglects your spleen and your kidneys.\nAs a result of that, too much heat is liberated because liver cannot work any more as it becomes so worried. With this heat, you get the phlegm melting away, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how you will get all these problems of cold, hay fever, sneezing, asthma.\nThen, at the pancreas, as the pancreas also becomes overactive, you develop diabetes. In Indian villages, a villager would not take tea unless and until the spoon stands at right angles in the sugar. But they never get diabetes. Only those people who are futuristic and think too much all the time get diabetes, and then from kidney they get high blood pressure and tensions.\nSo, on one side, we are covered by the ego, and on the other side, by our conditioning, which is a superego; and that\xe2\x80\x99s how we are cut out from the truth. So, to know the truth, what we have to do is to remove both these things, which are covering our brain.\nAnd as I told you yesterday, that when Kundalini rises, She pierces through this centre of Christ, and the whole of your conditioning and ego is sucked in; and that\xe2\x80\x99s how this portion opens up and you get your Self-realization, and you might feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.\nAt this time, you find from your fingertips, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve found yesterday, a kind of a cool breeze blowing inside. Also you have found yesterday a cool breeze coming out of your head. Many people doubt first, that it might be some window is open or something. Yes, of course the window is open \xe2\x80\x94 but in your head. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how you have felt the cool breeze coming out of it.\nThis happening is described very well in the ancient scriptures, in all the scriptures. In some scriptures, it is described in a little ambiguous manner, or a mysterious manner. But very clearly it is described by certain saints of India who have very secretly given Self-realization to very few people in the past.\nAs I told you, this is a living process of a living energy of evolution.\nBut beyond these two channels that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, we have some other problems, which are very serious, and we are not aware of them. One of them are on the left-hand side, as you know; is the collective subconscious area. This area has\xe2\x80\xa6 has in it all that is dead, since our creation. And on the right-hand side, you have, at the extreme, something called the collective supraconscious. That is what\xe2\x80\xa6 all the dead who have been very futuristic. Contains all the dead who have been very futuristic people.\nSo now, when there is evil, when you see evil\xe2\x80\xa6 so many will say there is no evil \xe2\x80\x94 because they must be evil themselves \xe2\x80\x94 but there is evil. This evil crawls into us from the left or from the right, from the collective subconscious or the collective supraconscious.\nWhen you see many people who go to false gurus and lose all their money, everything, and become bankrupt, and then become recluses, you are surprised that how educated people get into such troubles.\nEven if you, say, do any religion as such, they also end up into this area very fast. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, in India now we have Hinduism, which is actually basically based on the ascent of human beings, like\xe2\x80\xa6 or any other religion. But if you go to these temples and\xe2\x80\xa6 during the time when the Goddess is worshipped for nine days, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed that we have all kinds of possessed people, dancing and doing all kinds of funny gestures. Now, these are all possessed people and \xe2\x80\x94 possessed women, and they are mostly maidservants \xe2\x80\x94 and they can tell you the name of the horse which is going to win in the races. They can tell you all kinds of nonsensical thing which has nothing to do with God or with the Goddess.\nSo now we have, say, another religion, which we call as Jainism, who believe in vegetarianism to such an extent that they cannot even kill mosquitoes. They get a man inside a hut and put all the little little bugs inside, so the bugs should suck the blood of that man; and they\xe2\x80\x99ll revere that man because he has given blood to so many bugs.\nThen we have some Buddhists, who go on having some sort of a\xe2\x80\xa6 (moves Her hand as if rotating a rattle) what you call\xe2\x80\xa6 a kind of a\xe2\x80\xa6 round moving chakras (wheels); goes on humming, humming, humming like mad. By doing that, are you going to get your ascent? By moving those wheels, are we going to rise in our evolution?\nAnd they think that by beating on the\xe2\x80\xa6 vertebral column, beating on this column, vertebral column, that they can raise the Kundalini. And they can go to any extreme, the beat.\nBasically, behind all these things is money-making. All these lamas and all these are making lots of money, and they have too much gold with them.\nNow you come to Islam. And you find that in Islamic religion same thing: people are just quarrelling and fighting; now you see Iraq, Iran \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s mad thing.\nThen you come to Christianity. Christianity is the religion of compassion. But Christians are the cruellest people you could think. When they went to America, they killed all the aboriginals. In South America, you can\xe2\x80\x99t find one person who can be called as a Red Indian, not one person. They came to India with a\xe2\x80\xa6 one\xe2\x80\xa6 gun in one hand and Bible in another hand. Are they the disciples of Christ, who said: \xe2\x80\x9cO My Father, please forgive them because they do not know what they are doing\xe2\x80\x9d?\nChrist has said: \xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt not have any adulterous eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d Have you found any\xe2\x80\xa6 even Christian priests who are\xe2\x80\xa6 who haven\xe2\x80\x99t got adulterous eyes?\nSo, when we see religion becoming so funny and perverted, we start losing faith in God. And many people believe there is no God.\nBut I think this is very unscientific. You must find out the truth, is there God or not, is there a Creator or not. Without finding it out, if you just say there is no God, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all this religious nonsense, you must know that you have done no justice to your creator.\nAll these great Incarnations, and all these prophets, and all these great people who came on this Earth to establish proper religion \xe2\x80\x94 have been misused! Have been\xe2\x80\xa6 they have been used for money-making! Or for power! They have nothing to do with God.\nBut God exists \xe2\x80\x94 and now can be proved when you get your Self-realization.\nActually, Buddha felt: no use talking about God; because if you talk about God, they\xe2\x80\x99ll forget about Self-realization. So He said, \xe2\x80\x9cFirst I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them about Self-realization, Self-realization, Self-realization.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo now I have to tell you that this Power resides within you, which is coiled up in three and a half coils within yourself. And this Power has to manifest itself in these modern times in a big way. Of course, you cannot pay for it, it is too invaluable. And it works out. Not only works out but it helps you to get rid of most of your problems, and you become a very powerful personality. Your compassion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become just a talk, talk, but it becomes effective. It works.\nBecause this all-pervading Power, which starts flowing through you, is a thinking power, understanding power, is intelligence. It organizes, it cooperates. Above all, it loves. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a great thing to discover it! And also to discover about yourself. Which is such a glorious, beautiful thing! And it has to work out in a big way. It has been already predicted all over in so many ways that this was the time for it to work out.\nThere have been never so many seekers! It\xe2\x80\x99s the special category, which William Blake has described as \xe2\x80\x9cmen of God\xe2\x80\x9d. And he has said\xe2\x80\xa6 he has said that these men of God will know themselves and they will have power to make others know themselves.\nSo it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to understand the value of human life. That you are at the epitome of your evolution. And with this last happening, you will break through into that new realm of a realized personality.\nWhatever I may say, you have not to take Me for granted. You yourself have to experience it, and see for yourself, and achieve your complete establishment into the truth. Truth which is Divine Love.\nSo may God bless you!\nIf you have any questions, I would like to answer them. But not too many, because I would like to meet all of you one by one today.\n(To a seeker) [UNCLEAR] today for the first time?\nThen let\xe2\x80\x99s have it from yesterday first and foremost. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have it from yesterday first of all. People who came yesterday as well can ask the questions first.\n(After a pause) Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble. Once you have your Self-realization, no questions.\n(To a seeker) From yesterday? (To yogini) [Maria], is it from yesterday?\nYOGINI: She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to question.\nShri Mataji: Today or yesterday? (To a seeker) Was it your first time, madam?\nYogi: No, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\nShri Mataji: She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there? You see, that\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have it, then, from today.\n(A seeker asks a question in German)\n(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)\nNo, no, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about \xe2\x80\x9cworthy\xe2\x80\x9d. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to decide. Your Kundalini knows. Everybody is worthy of it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to judge yourself. Only keep happy, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\n(A seeker asks a question in German)\nYOGINI: What is the purpose of\xe2\x80\x94\nYogi: What is the meaning of Self-realization?\nShri Mataji: Oh, Self\xe2\x80\xa6 The purpose of Self-realization is to know your Self, where the Self is the embodiment of truth and embodiment of joy. And when you have Self-realization, then your attention becomes active and knows everything; apart from that, it works out all the problems. (Laughing) It\xe2\x80\x99s a big question.\nFirst of all, all your physical problems are solved. Most of them. Then your mental, emotional, spiritual problems are solved. You do not get into any tensions, you become a very kind personality. (Repeating to yogini) Any tensions.\nThen you start seeing everything as a drama. Now, if you are in the water, you are afraid of getting drowned. But supposing you are in the boat \xe2\x80\x94 then you see it, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\xa6 anything. But if you are a master swimmer, then you are not afraid of anything, and you can make others also master swimmers.\nThen you become collectively conscious. Is becoming; again I say, you become, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just mental, that \xe2\x80\x9cwe are all brothers and sisters\xe2\x80\x9d, or in just like just you will start reading each other\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. You start feeling another personality within yourself on your fingertips. So you realize that innate relationship between you and others.\nThen you get over all kinds of racialism, all kinds of false ideas of religion, or conditioning, of a country, this, that \xe2\x80\x94 all the nonsense that\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\nNow, supposing you become a democratic country. Then, at the extreme, you become very money-oriented. Terrible competitions, when the individual is given [utter] importance and collective [has none]. So such a country again goes down.\nBut supposing you are a communist. Then you\xe2\x80\xa6 you become very strong in your collective, but individually you go down. Because you have no value for the individual. As a result, your individual suffers.\nBut when you get your Self-realization, then every individual is nourished, and the collective becomes strong.\nNow, we have about fifty or sixty nations from where we have Sahaja Yogis. Numberless. Quite a lot. Germany, of course, is not so good, I must say. Not so many. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. But I have never seen anybody quarrelling, fighting, saying bad words, hurting\xe2\x80\xa6 If sometimes somebody does hurt someone, again he is\xe2\x80\xa6 apologises and tries to be all right \xe2\x80\x94 because he sees what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him. And he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. He just throws away. Unless and until we can see ourselves, how are we going to correct? But it\xe2\x80\x99s not mental, it just works out through the awakening and reawakening of Kundalini.\nAnd the complete transformation takes place. There is no question of any war or any kind of a conflict. Everybody is in complete joy and happiness. The marriages are successful, the children are beautiful \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s a new world, and a new age. This transformation is needed for the emancipation of humanity. We have all these institutions like United Nations, this, that. What work are they doing? They have not given any transformation.\nThis is what it is. This is the purpose in the transformation of human beings into their beauty and glory.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite a small question \xe2\x80\x94 and a big answer. Because I have given at least five-six lectures about it; and if you are interested, you can get the tape, and listen to it, and understand it in more details. [UNCLEAR] most of the people perhaps know what is Self-realization is, and what are the advantages are, but even if they want to know all the details, they can listen to these tapes and can understand.\n(A seeker asks a question in German)\n(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)\nOf course! Yes, yes, of course, of course! Why we are human beings. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get the answer why we are living and why we are human beings.\nYOGINI: He says he has another question for You.\n(A seeker asks a question in German)\n(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)\nShri Mataji: Now, that is we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry just now. None of you are going to die just now. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question of present. What are we going to get at the present. You see, what happens after death depends on the person also. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what happens just now.\n(To a seeker) Yes, madam?\n(A seeker asks a question in German)\n(To yogi) What\xe2\x80\x99s she saying? Nothing wrong?\nYogi: [UNCLEAR] [that You raise] Kundalini.\nShri Mataji: Oh. That is in the triangular bone called as sacrum. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s what I said, you were not here yesterday; I explained that this Kundalini is placed in the triangular bone called as sacrum and that the Greeks knew the word \xe2\x80\x9csacrum\xe2\x80\x9d.\nSEEKER: What can I do!\nShri Mataji: That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, we are going to do that. I am very happy to hear that question. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down, we are going to do it now. Very happy [to know]. All right? That\xe2\x80\x99s the very question I was wanting to hear.\n(A seeker asks a question in German)\n(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pass any remarks about Ramakrishna. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. Let us see [if it cures or not] has been proved now. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about people just now. Let us worry about ourselves. Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say something about Ramakrishna also. But we have cured people of cancer, no doubt. [UNCLEAR] with Kundalini awakening. If somebody did not do, that\xe2\x80\x99s not our business. If somebody did not do, that is not My business. I am responsible for what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying today before you. What has happened in the past is past. I take your responsibility.\n(A seeker asks a question in German)\n(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)\nYeah. That can be also cured. It can be cured.\n(A seeker asks another question)\nYOGINI: And homosexuality You have cured too?\nShri Mataji: Yes, I have.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a little problem with AIDS. We have two cases which we have cured, and one we had cured who again went back to the same habit, and\xe2\x80\xa6 he is no more now. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have will power. Their will power is very poor. [UNCLEAR].\nBut a Sahaja Yogi doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get all these diseases. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get any one of these diseases \xe2\x80\x94 if he is a Sahaja Yogi. But if he is not established Sahaja Yogi, just to come and gone away, then we can\xe2\x80\x99t say; but if they are Sahaja Yogis, they don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the thing you get.\n(A seeker asks a question in German)\n(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)\nMaybe. Also karmas. But in realization your karmas are all sucked in.\n(A seeker asks a question in German)\n(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)\nYes, practically most of them. Practically most of them. But if something is dead and all that, then you could say we cannot do it. For example, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a cataract, we will not be able to cure a cataract. Or something dead. You see, supposing there\xe2\x80\x99s a fibroid, or some sort of things there are. So many people cannot be cured.\nYou see, unless and until you get your\xe2\x80\xa6 (To yogini) Huh? She\xe2\x80\x99s asking question?\nYOGINI: No.\nShri Mataji: (To a seeker) [UNCLEAR], madam?\nSEEKER: I just said [UNCLEAR] [I was fine].\nYOGINI: She just told me to [UNCLEAR].\nShri Mataji: Huh?\nYOGINI: She just told me [UNCLEAR].\nShri Mataji: All right.\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I must really, at the very outset, confess to you. At the very outset, I must confess to you something \xe2\x80\x94 that the Divine is common sense. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a doctor. It is only interested in people who will do divine work. It\xe2\x80\x99s like\xe2\x80\xa6 supposing there\xe2\x80\x99s a lamp here which goes out of order. Now, if this lamp cannot be used again for giving light, nobody would be interested in repairing it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? So, Divine works for people who are willing to give the light to others. The light of love, without any money, without any power exerted, and without any gains whatsoever.\n(A seeker asks a question in German)\n(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)\n(Laughing) Oh yes, all right. That\xe2\x80\x99s the best way [UNCLEAR].\nAll right, now the time is up, let\xe2\x80\x99s have our Self-realization. Sit down. Supposing I\xe2\x80\x99ve done the cooking. And if you are hungry, you will not ask many questions, you\xe2\x80\x99ll just say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, let\xe2\x80\x99s have the food!\xe2\x80\x9d But those who are not hungry will just ask questions and won\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything. So best thing is that you better have your Self-realization.\nAt the very outset, I [would again] request you to do few things which are very simple. One of them is that you have to take out your shoes. This is how we take the help of our Mother Earth.\nNow, those who do not want to have Self-realization should leave this hall. Those who just wanted to ask questions have already left.\nSo. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s have it, something that is so important for us.\nThe another thing is that \xe2\x80\x94 as I am here only for today, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back after one year \xe2\x80\x94 I would also like to tell you how to raise your Kundalini yourself. Because even if it is awakened and breaks through, but again goes back to the places where you require energy. So, after realization all of you should attend the workshop and understand what is happening within yourself. Where is the problem and how to correct it. Also you must know what\xe2\x80\xa6 what is the decoding of this message on the fingertips. And also you should know how to give realizations to others and fix them up, fix their Kundalini up for ever. Also you will learn how to cure yourself and cure others. And for all this you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay any money.\nBut in the beginning, I would request you not to bring all the relations who are sick. First you all become the doctors. And then start treating the people whom you want to treat or to help. So, first you have to be well equipped. You have to be well equipped.\nAll right. Now, the second thing is to put your left hand towards Me this way, which is very simple. Now, this represents your desire to get Self-realization. And with the right hand we start releasing our chakras one by one. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how to do it in proper way. Because the right hand is for action. And you have to sit very comfortably, to put both feet on the ground, straight touching the ground, in the parallel way. Put the left hand like this, and the right hand is to be used for touching different centres on the left-hand side.\nNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you first you have to touch your heart. In the heart resides the spirit.\nNow, you have to put your right hand now in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now. You have to take this hand there because this is the centre of your mastery.\nNow, you have to take your hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the centre of pure knowledge of the Divine. Now. Here, when you start moving up, the Kundalini moves up with you.\nSo now you put your hand again back on the centre of your mastery in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.\nNow, take this right hand on your heart.\nNow, put this right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your head to your right. Please take it from the front, like that. Not this way, not this way. All right, now turn to your right. Now. This is a very important centre because most of the people catch it when you feel\xe2\x80\xa6 I would say, when you feel guilty.\nThen take your hand on your forehead across and press it on both the sides. Here is the centre of forgiveness.\nNow. Take back your right hand on the back side of your head and push it back. This is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness.\n\nNow stretch your hand fully. And the centre of your palm, you put it on top of your head, in the centre where it was a soft bone in the fontanelle bone area. Now move your scalp. Press it hard, push out your fingers, move your scalp clockwise seven times. Scalp.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all. Now you have to close your eyes.\nBefore that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what mistakes sometimes we\xe2\x80\x99ll commit. First is, your hand, left hand should be like this (shows Her hand palm up) and not like that (shows Her hand palm forward). Left hand. Second is that the second hand that you\xe2\x80\x99ll use, this hand should be taken from the front for this centre (puts Her right hand on Her left Vishuddhi). And again, not this way, but this way. Is very simple thing that we have to do.\nNow you can close your eyes. If you want, you can take out your spectacles also because it might be your eyesight might improve. Now, please don\xe2\x80\x99t open your eyes till I tell you.\n\nNow. Put the left hand towards Me and\xe2\x80\xa6 you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to fight with yourself, don\xe2\x80\x99t have to fight with your thoughts, just be relaxed. Actually, you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.\n(To a seeker) No, not like that. Now see, again I\xe2\x80\xa6 just open your eyes. Put the hand like this comfortably on the table. Stretch the hand, yes. Not this way (stretches Her arm palm forward), not that way (stretches Her arm palm up), just on the table. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t bend to much, don\xe2\x80\x99t make it back, but just sit straight, comfortably.\n\nNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you that you are at the epitome of your evolution and you should not feel guilty; on the contrary, you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. First thing, you have to forgive yourself.\nNow, let us have your left hand like this, comfortably put, and both the feet little apart from each other. And now you close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart. Now, as I told you, in the heart resides the spirit, so you ask Me a very fundamental question. Put the fingers straight on the table. Please ask Me a question; you may address Me as Mother or Shri Mataji. So please ask the question three times: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, am I the spirit?\xe2\x80\x9d Just ask the question. Three times. This question is very important.\nBut this also means that if you are the spirit you are your master. So ask the second question, by putting your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen, upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, am I my own master?\xe2\x80\x9d Ask this question three times again.\n\nNow, take down your right hand. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t open your eyes, keep them closed. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you open your eyes at all. Now, put down your hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here is the pure knowledge of the divine laws. But I cannot force you. So, I have to ask you to ask Me, like: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, may I have the pure knowledge? Mother, please give me the pure knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d Ask this question six times because this centre has got six petals. By asking for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving upward.\n\nSo, now you raise your hand, right hand, in the up\xe2\x80\x94 in the lower part\xe2\x80\xa6 upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here, to open the centre, with full confidence please say: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am my own master.\xe2\x80\x9d Please say this ten times.\n\nNow. Please raise your right hand on your heart. To open this centre, you have to say with full confidence: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am the spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d Say it twelve times because this is the most fundamental truth.\nNow, raise your right hand to your neck, the corner between the neck and your shoulder, and place your head on the right-hand side. This is the centre caught when you feel guilty. So please say with full confidence: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am not guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d Say it sixteen times.\n\nNow, we have to know that the Divine is the ocean of love, compassion and bliss. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. And there is nothing that cannot be dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness. But now if you feel guilty still, you can say it for hundred and eight times to punish yourself if you still feel guilty.\nNow, take your hand to your forehead. Keep your eyes closed, don\xe2\x80\x99t open them in between. And press it on both the sides. Now, here you have to say: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I forgive everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe you might think that it is difficult. But whether you forgive or don\xe2\x80\x99t forgive, it\xe2\x80\x99s a myth. But if you don\xe2\x80\x99t forgive, then you play into wrong hands. Just say it once, but from your heart.\nNow, you can take your right hand and put it on the back side of your head and allow your head to rest on it. Now, do not feel guilty or do not count your mistakes. Without feeling all that, you have to, just for your own satisfaction, say: \xe2\x80\x9cO Divine, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d Please put your hand on the back side of your head, back side, not on top. The back side. And push it upward. Now say it from your heart.\nNow stretch your hand fully, push back your fingers, and put the centre of your palm on the fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood, and press it hard. Now, stretch back your fingers, and press it hard, and press your scalp, moving clockwise seven times. At this time, you have to say that \xe2\x80\x9cMother, please give me my realization,\xe2\x80\x9d because I cannot force on your liberty. (To yogini) Because I do not want to force it on them. They have to ask for it.\nNow take down your hand. Put the left\xe2\x80\x94 Please open your eyes. Put your right hand towards Me like this. Like this, so high. And now raise your left hand and see for yourself, bend your head and see for yourself if there\xe2\x80\x99s a cool breeze coming out of your head.\nNow, you put your left hand towards Me. And bend your head and see with your right hand if there\xe2\x80\x99s a cool breeze coming out.\nNow, you again put your right hand and see for yourself if there\xe2\x80\x99s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Out of your fontanelle bone area, a cool breeze. Some people get it far away, some very near. You have to little bit bend your head.\nNow, put both the hands towards the sky. And now push back your head and ask the question. Ask the question: \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?\xe2\x80\x9d Or, ask the question: \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the Chaitanya?\xe2\x80\x9d Or, ask the question: \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the All-pervading Power of Divine Love?\xe2\x80\x9d Ask this question three times. Ask this question three times.\nNow please, you can put down your hands. Please put down your hands. All those who have felt the cool breeze on top of their heads or in their hands, please raise both your hands. I would like to see.\nAah! Look at that! Surprising! Thank you very much!\nSome may not get it, maybe; they might get it next time. They should all go to the workshop and work it out. Those who have got it are the lucky ones. And those who haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it should not be disappointed, it can be worked out very easily.\nNow, I would like to meet all of you, those who want to meet Me. You can come one by one from here, and I would like to meet you all.\n(To a seeker) How are you? All right? You felt the cool breeze?\nSEEKER: Yes, Shri Mataji.\nShri Mataji: Felt it?

Did you been to some gurus? Have you been at some gurus? That\xe2\x80\x99s why. Now, you put your hand there (puts the seeker\xe2\x80\x99s right hand on the seeker\xe2\x80\x99s stomach and starts working on the seeker\xe2\x80\x99s left hand).\nAll right.

But she can\xe2\x80\x99t put it like this.\n\nShri Mataji: Why? What happened to you?\n\nYogi: The joint [UNCLEAR] [at this point] is gone, nothing inside, neither this nor this.\n\nShri Mataji: Really?\n\nYogi: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: Why?\n\nYogi: It was an infection somehow, and they made an operation.
