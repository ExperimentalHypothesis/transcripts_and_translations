...the thoughts will stop and they will be beyond thought.   And this is a very, very important chakra for Sahaj yogis, because when the kundalini rises above, above the Agnya chakra, immediately there is no thought.   We do not get any thoughts from ego or super ego, but there is a wobbling in the Agnya because of your in-balanced ways;  the in-balanced ways are sometimes that you are with ego or super ego.   This has happened to our people in the West, because we have had so much of ego we got really tired of it.   We got frightened with it.   Then we started taking to drugs and things to increase our super ego, but by doing that what we are doing is pushing by one end, bringing by another end and that's how we are wobbling our ego and super ego, by which we are not helping ourselves at all.   


So what one has to do, is to rise within oneself up the point of Agnya and try to steady your Agnya.    There are many people who have asked me one question: 'How to steady the Agnya?'   Agnya is placed at the crossing point of our nerves and also optic [CHARAMIS?] Now so it is said if you have wobbling eyes you have a wobbling Agnya;  you have to steady your eyes, you have to soothe them.   Now it is very, very out of date, ancient, old and all sorts of names that you call to a thing like that.   But you must realise and steady them in such a way that it is very soothing for the eyes, which is the most soothing thing for the eyes is the green grass.   Which you could see the green grass with your eyes, means you walk with your eyes on the ground.   Your eyes really soothed, your Agnya will be alright.   That's why Christ said: 'I'll tell you about the adulterous eyes'.   He talked about adulterous eyes, the eyes with which you do adultery.   It's a very common thing these days;  every woman a man must see, every man a woman must see and if it is the most important job, if you have not seen one woman you're finished.   I mean this is being modern, but I am an old-fashioned lady and at the time of Christ he said;  'You should not have adulterous eyes.' And the ones who have adulterous eyes are no more than any other than our western Christians, who all the time even in the church, even when they are giving sermons, their eyes are moving with adultery.   These eyes have to be very, very pure, very, very deep and very loving when you want to have your Agnya alright, because you receive through your eyes.   Say if you have closed your eyes, you do not put your attention to anything, because your eyes are closed, you're not adding more thoughts to yourself, but if your eyes are open, you are adding much more thoughts, because everywhere the eyes go the attention goes and you see things and create thoughts and put in them. .So your attention which has to go the spirit, which has to go to God, which has to shine through the window of Divine, this beautiful thing is ruined by the way we use our eyes and we do not respect it.   There's nothing so pure and beautiful as the grass on the ground, or the ground itself, which takes our feet, which supports us, which looks after us, which enriches us.   We should put our eyes on the mother earth instead of looking at every person. 


But from Sahaj Yoga point of view now, many of you know, what happens to your eyes when you look at somebody;  maybe an entity might enter into your eyes and it is, you'll be amazed, that it is the play of the entity what we call this so-called flirting is..and talked about it before also and people didn't like it when I told them about it.   But I have seen actually it is entering from eyes to eyes.  I've seen very simple people who come down to such places, say in a party; in a party people are just exchanging entities from one eye to another; once it goes to another person, he puts his entity into another person and that then goes into another person.   All the time your attention is diverted;  you feel it is attracted towards something you do not know why it is attracted.   Now the certain symbols are also waiting to add up to the problems, you see all the society is working at it;  you should appear in such a way that every man should look at you;  every woman should look at you.   Why?   What is the use?   Supposing I look at you, what do I gain, what do I gain by looking at a person?   What is the advantage?   Just looking at a person we are wasting such a lot of energy for what?   In the same way, if you are walking on the roads on say, we are seeing some beautiful things, alright, if you have to buy something alright go ahead see those things whatever you have selected is alright, but all the time just because you're eyes are such, you are just doing it and you do not know the reason why you are doing like this, all the time why your eyes are wobbling.   And that is a sure and certain sign for a person to become mad, absolutely that is a sure and certain sign is when a person is mad, how do you make it out that a person is lunatic.   You can see his eyes the iris and eyes are all the time wobbling.   They cannot keep it steady, or they are sick, there also you can see that these eyes are all the time wobbling, there's no steadiness.   Not only this, but you have seen those people who come into Sahaj Yoga, when they close out their eyes, they find their eyes are flickering, their eyelids are flickering;  that means that some sort of a disturbance in the kundalini rising.   Whole attention, if you call it as hundred, then at least eighty percent of it comes through our eyes when how [?]....to protect our eyes from all kind of useless activities the Agnya. 


Christ...Christ's life shows so many aspects of how to respect others, but to one of them which has been very much misused throughout is that of the prostitute.   He saved the prostitute, He saved her no doubt, but you spoil the prostitutes;  a good woman you make her into prostitutes, you give her ideas, by which she becomes a prostitute, a good [HANNEEF?] is turned into prostitute by egoistical man.   Young small girls, who are virgins, are destroyed by your dirty glances.   Do you realise this, that you are doing just the opposite what Christ had done and you say that he saved Christ so even if we are prostitutes you should save us.   But why be prostitutes?   This is such a stupid style of thinking that we should become prostitutes so that Christ will save us.   One has to think about all these things in the proper light of Sahaja Yoga.    Unless and until you are realised, my talk is just useless for you, but once you are realised you will know, and if you glance at someone, you might suddenly get a headache at the back, you might feel a dart has gone into your head or something has happened.    You might feel that you are blinding with somebody's face and you will get all kinds of experiences by which we know how important are your eyes.    All your nervousness and everything can be cured if you have pure eyes.   But it is such a vicious circle, that through your eyes you gather all the bad and it is accumulated in the Agnya and you have to clear the Agnya to make the eyes clear.   It's a vicious circle, but it can start at a point, as I said, we have to ask for forgiveness.   Secondly, we have to bring Christ in our Agnya Chakra.   Thirdly, we have to give up all drugs and all intoxicants and all smoking; that happens automatically when you are a Sahaj yogi, it will work out.   But eyes express the whole of your brain, your body, your limbs, everything and if your Agnya is alright then your eyes are perfectly alright, they emit nothing but love, wherever they glance;  only with the glance of your eyes you can raise the kundalini.   Only with the glance of your eyes you can cure people.   Only with your glance you can bring joy into the destroyed and the ruined people.   So these eyes which you see are the windows of your being, of your heart.   When the spirit is expressed through your eyes, you must have noticed yourself, that when the kundalini rises the eyes become dilated and a realised soul has got black eyes because they have, er, these eyes are dilated, at least when I see them they're all dilated black eyes.   Apart from that, a realised soul can be made out by his eyes, which are sparkling;  there's a sparkle like diamonds, they sparkle all the time and you can make out from the eyes that this person is a realised soul.   There's a tremendous difference between an non-realised soul's eyes and a realised soul's eyes.   So you can imagine how your spirit sees through your eyes;  but if the eyes are not pure, it doesn't stay there long.   So if we have to understand Christ, physically we have to respect our eyes, mentally we have to give up all that is impure in our mind. 


Now, so we come to the impurities of the mind and impurities of mind are - there are so many poisons you know about.   I mean there are books and books written about the poisons and the psychologists are supposed to take out all your poisons, I don't know if they can do it at all, but they have the worst Agnya, all these psychologists have the worst Agnya and I don't think they are capable of really giving any relief to people who are suffering mentally.   Mental sufferings are of two types, say the same thing that one is...One type of mental troubles are where people oppress you very much, you go on bearing the cross.   Now this is a very wrong idea people have about Christ.   Bearing the cross doesn't mean that anybody who tries to oppress you, you should go one taking the enslavement upon yourself.   You are not to be enslaved to anyone whatsoever.   Anybody who tries to make a slave out of you, you should deny it absolutely.   You should say 'Ham, I am, who are you to dominate'.   Anyone whether you are of a black skin, a red skin or a yellow skin, nobody has the right to dominate anyone in this whole world and if anybody is doing it, or what to do now, after all, you see, we are poor people, or we are like this, or he is supporting and all that, then they are running away from their duty towards themselves.   Such people cannot get realisation.   Slaves are not going to become kings.   So the slavery that is supposed to be confused with bearing the cross is another confusion of modern times.   We have to rise in our self respect and we have to understand that no one in this world has a right to dominate us.   But then what is bearing of the Cross.   First of all the people of his level never suffer;  it's just a joke going on, it's a leela, it's a play going on.   They never suffer and even if they so-called act as suffering, they just do it because they want to do it.   They're not helpless people, they are not slaves and those who think that by bearing it up, and by suffering it, we are becoming Christians, they should know their psychological basis.   And if they are crying and weeping and all the time saying 'what to do, you see I am in love and my lover tortures me' you are neither in love, neither you have a lover.   It is a kind of a psychological clubbing; that he is a dominating man and you his domination, that's why you are together.   Simple fact;  for every human being has his own self respect and he must respect himself, that is the spirit within him and nothing should dominate him.   Whether you belong to this country, or that country, or this ism, or that ism, all this will break down under the rule of God.   Nobody has the right to dominate anybody's spirit.   But when you are given freedom, you go to the other side, that is Mr. Ego.   You do not know how to use your freedom, so you try to dominate others.   Your freedom is, everybody's freedom is in danger.   You are on top of everyone and torturing everybody's souls and you are dominating by land, by properties, or by possessions.   So either this way or that way, mentally if you are of this category, or that category, you are against yourself.   Just be in the centre and see for yourself.   Just be looking at it.   Are you emitting love towards another person?   If you are a slave, how can you love?   You cannot.   If you are free and abandoned, how can you love?   Love has its own advantages.   Very sweet and beautiful;  you have to give the depth.  


You enjoy those advantages, for a little child will come to your house and he will spoil your house, no doubt, and that he should do and you should enjoy that spoiling, then your freedom, if it is challenged by a little child's crying, then you are not wise people.   This is abandonment, or I would say it is loneliness, cutting off from the primordial, the big one, from the large one that you are is not to be able to tolerate the freedom of others.   A child has no freedom to cry in the house, what sort of freedom you conceive of?   A mother has no right to say something she wants to say about her child, which is her duty to tell him what is right and wrong?   If the son does not have right to eat whatever he likes in his own mother's family, then what sort of freedom do you have?   It is such a confusion of things.   So this kind of freedom is just the opposite and extreme of enslavement, but in the centre is love, where you are bound by everyone and bound by children.   Yes, I am, and proud of them;  they bound me and I bound them too.    It's a mutual bounding which we enjoy among ourselves.   There is such a give and take when there is such a bondage of love.  But do we understand the importance of bondage of love?   At the slightest pretext we break it.   Say wife says ' I would like to go out today'.   Husband will say 'Why, I'm very tired, don't you understand?'   Or if the husband says 'I will feel like eating something,' or some particular thing, he says , pancake or something, small thing, 'Oh, I'm very tired', every time you are given, if she could just think by making that little thing, he would be so very happy.   She should be dying to know what he wants, and he should be dying to do what she wants and then enjoy each other's company, or you are wasting all your properties that you have as human beings.   You don't know how much you are wasting each other.  Every moment is filled with such beautiful bondages;   we're extremely [TALENTED?] what are we [???]?   The way you are fighting, the way you are going about, what have you gained, let me see?   When you die you have to announce in the paper that XYZ is dead and you find there's nobody and you have to go pay people to go visit you when you die.   This is the case today, such dryness, such emptiness, such loneliness exists.   What have you achieved through this?   So this bondage we have to and there is no question of sacrifice you see the way, we must sacrifice for the family.   What are you sacrificing?   I mean if you pay for your family, you get the joy out of it, that's why you do it.  If you have to lead a nice, good life, you are not sacrificing anything, but you are gaining by that, leading a good life.   If your wife says 'Don't go to the pub' and if you do not go there, then you should not say she's an orthodox, old-fashioned, this that, that and that, but instead you should thank your stars that in these modern times also there's somebody that's telling you the truth.   Because the whole edifice has come up, do you mean to say that truth should not be told?   All this is falsehood which you are living and if you have to be happy come down to reality.   


Friends also the same thing.   With the friends, what sort of relations we have with our friends?   What do we expect from them?   Sending them a Christmas Card?   And then if they don't send, feeling bad about it?   There are no deeper bondages; we have not lived with them.   If we allow ourselves to be bound by them, they will be bound by us.   You better try this;  try to be bound by them, don't be afraid of anybody else, just try to be bound by others and you will be amazed how much they will be giving you.   I am a living example of this.   I can tell you, I am a living example of this;  I am bound by all of you.   If somebody says 'Mother, when are you going to leave us?'  No I cannot, I cannot, I'm just bound by you, I just do not want to leave you, because I love you very much, how can I leave you?   It's impossible for me.   So then what do I gain out of this love?   Every thing that is in this world, what do you want me to get?   I cannot even come to what I can get out of it.   Immeasurable ocean.   I become an ocean myself.   Break your ideas about your own personal freedom and liberation.   In liberating your intelligence you are liberating your own wisdom and the sweetness and the beauty, which is never perishable, whether you are old or young, that is going to be your own.   But these poisons that are being built outside and inside you, please throw then away, these are mental poisons.   Through Agnya you can take them out.   You see this is an opening also which, through which many things go out.   Try to work it out, look at the tree with love and you will find that the tree itself is giving you the joy of its creation, because you will become thoughtless and the creator who has made that beautiful tree will be pouring all that joy which is stored into it;  every human being is a store of joy, unlimited, I assure you, believe me, and don't waste them because somebody is not properly dressed, or he's not according to the way you want him to be which you learnt in your public school.   Every doorstep everywhere there is beauty lying, do not miss it, but if you have a possessiveness about it, and a [DELFI..?] about it, then you can never enjoy them, you can never enjoy all that beauty, all that store, all that wealth that is in every human being, every moment it is bubbling.   For Agnya it is a good thing Christmas is coming and at the time I have to wish you a Happy Christmas that at this occasion I am speaking about Agnya Chakra, in which what I said is Agnya is, what one must know what to order and how to obey, obey the Divine, obey your elders, obey yourself and not your ego and then can order also others.   Not only human beings but you can even order the sun and the moon and all the winds and everything in the world.   Everything you can control, everything with this Agnya;  you try one thing, if you know somebody is going to do something wrong, take his name and put it to Agnya, he will not do it.   Try it;  this is a trick I am telling about for those who are realised souls, not for those who are not yet realised, but those who are realised can try.   If the other person is doing something wrong, you can try your Agnya.   Anything you order on your Agnya will be respected, but your Agnya must have Christ there, because you have the great support awakened within you which does not exist here, but into every mindset;  it is all-pervading into all small atoms and molecules.   It is everywhere into the sun and any place you go.   It is there, so try to develop your Agnya, that is the mastery of yourself.   Those who have a good Agnya can master anything and understand that the Agnya about mastering wordly things and mastering human beings and mastering these and some of them are mastering, say, other crafts and things.   Best thing is to master your Agnya and you really become the master of yourself, by which by which you can master many things and today, on this great day when I'm wishing you a Happy Christmas, I wish you to have the most powerful Agnyas that people when they see your forehead should know that Christ is being born again within you.   

May God bless you.
