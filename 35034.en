Music and Conversation on Sainath of Shirdi

[Somebody is playing guitar, a Marathi song]

Shri Mataji: Hai, Mathe.

Sahaja Yogis: Hai, Mathe.

[End of the song]

Shri Mataji: Wow, beautiful, very beautiful, very, very beautiful, beautiful.

A Sahaja Yogi: Thank you, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Hmm, just tremendous. How did you do it?

Everybody’s laughing.

Shri Mataji: Marathi kaha se aa gaya?

Sahaja Yogi who was singing: Ma, English main likha hoga, translation Madhuri [unclear].

Shri Mataji: Marathi is a very difficult language to pronounce, but you did well.

Sahaja Yogi who was singing: Yes... I made a lot of mistakes at first.

Shri Mataji: We have the most difficult language. Beautiful. But I feel Marathi is a very integrated language.

Sahaja Yogi who was singing: Yes.

Shri Mataji: It’s a very integrated language. It doesn’t have only one style or one type of things. It is very direct and very subtle, very, very integrated language. I mean, even the jokes and things, there is no vulgarity at all. Maharashtrians don’t know vulgarity. All the time they are laughing. And people can’t understand so why they are laughing. Every word, you see, has double meanings and this and that, very happy people. Very integrated language, I must say.

Like my husband who have come with Me, he used to come with me to see some Marathi places, and to translate it at that instant, I mean instantaneously, was so difficult for Me. I said, “This language has a big tradition behind it, history behind it. How to translate it that fast?” One day, it happened one word like [Marathi] word came in. [Marathi]. He said, “What’s that?” I said, “All right, I’ll go and tell you at home, you see? It’s a funny word. It cannot be explained in one minute.” He said, “But what that does mean? Everybody laughs, you see.” I said, “I’ll tell you at home.” So, when we went home, I told him, “Let’s see, this man he said look like [Marathi]. So, the meaning is that supposing a person dies, now he becomes the forefathers of someone who is on this earth. Now he is doing all kinds of sinful things. So, he is the [paapi] who is doing all kinds of sinful things. So how his forefather will feel helpless and how he will look, how he will [tend] down, you see, with the idea that he cannot throw this fellow, into his grave, grand grandson or whosoever, maybe. That it means that that man who is dead long time back and he is worried of his grand grandson who is committing sin. So, this fellow look like that fellow.” He said, “That [paap].” Just see. It’s such a description of a man that he looks like a [Paapyasetitar] as if he was the great-grandfather of a sinner who died long time back. How will he feel in the limbo? You see. I mean, this is one of the things; otherwise it is full of jokes. And every word, everything is so humorous. If you are in the company of My brother Ranjeshwara, Baba, the stomach starts paining all the time; just can’t help it. Hmm, [unclear].

Sahaja Yogi: [Marathi].

Another Sahaja Yogi: No? I’m be able to play it with the words in and be very [rusty].

Shri Mataji: Your jazz music is somewhere near ours, jazz music. But there’s no system in jazz. We have a system. But the creativity is the same style. It goes into ragas, only jazz, but there’s no built-up system for that. Ours is melody, but it is very creative also, such as integrated all those things. One...

Sahaja Yogi: Sai Baba ki aarti [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Sainath. Shirdi Sainath. His aarti.

Sahaja Yogi: Lalit Pancham raga hai.

Shri Mataji: This is Lalit, is a very beautiful raga, Lalit Pancham.

[Bhajan]

Shri Mataji: He was a Muslim but how they respected him. He was a Muslim but in Maharashtra he’s respected as a big saint. Vibrations started. [Hindi].

[End of bhajan.]

Shri Mataji: Ha, Sainath of Shirdi.

Sainath, you see, was a, you know about Sainath in Shirdi, but he took a photograph of Sai Baba, one photographer, and his all folds were there, and on the fold My face came, completely, with My round thing, and face, eyes, everything; complete face came on it. So, the Shishya showed him, the one who had taken the photograph. He said, “Who is this?” He said, “This is my Mother. And She’s going to come back one day.” Now, this one, this photograph was then acquired by his son. And this, he saw My photograph, this happened in [Hindi] Ambarnath.

So, this fellow, when he saw My photograph, he came to Me and he said that, “See, Mother Your photograph was in Sainath’s clothes and all that. We wrote to him this thing, that and we got a book also. And this is Your photograph. I said, “It’s true.” ”Were You his Mother?” I said, “It’s true. I was his Mother.” So then, you see, this man became very greedy himself, became very greedy. He enlarged the photograph, he wrote a book, you see, praising Me, saying all these things. There’s a book written down, all these things. But, you see, the greed killed him completely. He made a big temple out of it and all that thing and he made money out of it. I mean, naturally I had nothing to do with him. I said, “This is, this is no good. How can you make money out of this saint place as Ambarnath?”

Sharayuh can tell you many things about Me.

There was another guru who was staying there. His name was Jagannath Baba. And he had another, his guru was in actually in the real Ambarnath. It is there, I have forgotten the name of that guru, something like - wait a bit. So, this fellow came to see Sharayuh. He said, “When is Mataji coming to see you?” She said, “Oh, She’s coming on such and such day.” He said, “She must come to my ashram. I must see Her, because my guru has told me that Adi Shakti has taken Her birth and She will come to Ambarnath. So, you stay there and She will clear your Agnya.” So, Sharayuh was quite surprised, you see. She said, “All right, when My Mother will come, I’ll ask Her.”

NOT ON THE TAPE:

So, you, “We will be joyous. You see, you have no fun in life. We have all the fun. We have all the pleasures; you have no pleasures.” They say, “You dress up in a way that’s very, sort of very cumbersome.” Anything, I mean they, they have ideas about things, you know. They are sorted out, according to them. Their dress is very sensible and not to have the dress is even more sensible. Then, what will you give them, a concrete example?

Sahaja Yogi: [Then/Though], we can say if they are so free, how come they have to depend on a chair to sit on it?

Shri Mataji: It’s all right. They say that chair is all right. We can make the chair for sitting on it. What’s the harm? I mean, that’s why they are developed because they have comfort. They don’t, should not live like primitive people sitting on the ground.

Sahaja Yogi: They’re slaves to their cigarettes and...

Another Sahaja Yogi: If, if they are on an aircraft and, and they, they are thinking that they are free to travel to Spain and they are there in that travelling and you are telling, “You are not travelling. You are just sitting there. The aircraft is not moving and I can prove it to you.” So you, you can. They’ll say, “Yes, in twenty-four hours I’ll be there.” Then you say, “No, you see in twenty-four hours I’ll prove you that you will still be here.” And they can; they can believe whatever they want. But the aircraft isn’t still moving.

Shri Mataji: No, no, but, but it’s a fact. They are richer people. They are much more comfortable. They have much more yarns in the heads than the, these poor Indians, or any other person, you see. “Why should we be saints?” They can’t understand. What is the advantage? You see, for them everything must be valued, in advantage and disadvantage.

Sahaja Yogini: I would say, “If you are so free, why can’t you go for walk, for walk in a park at night?”

Shri Mataji: Why don’t you?

Sahaja Yogini: Why can’t you walk in the park at night if you are so free?

Another Sahaja Yogini: For fear that you might be [attacked].

Shri Mataji: But they can say that...

Sahaja Yogini: They have no freedom, [though they think] to be free.

Shri Mataji: No, they’ll say that even, you see that fear that one has, everybody can have, because in the park somebody can rob you.

Sahaja Yogi: No, independence and pleasure in [just playing with] some other objects not within.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] This is our theory that there is something within. But concrete proof you have to give this mental being. They don’t believe supposing there is another life, or a better life.

Sahaja Yogi: Happiness is a state of mind. I, I believe happiness is a state of mind.

Shri Mataji: Then whatever you believe they will say, “I’m not [interested]”.

Sahaja Yogi: No, no, I’m talking about people who are materialistic. They have, you know, I mean, what they want, and if they are happy in that state of mind, that’s their life style. But it’s the way we understood life that...

Shri Mataji: Yes, but how will you convince them that they should take to our life? How will you convince them that they should take to our life, that we have a higher life than theirs? How are we higher than them? Because they think they have fun, they have more pleasures and comfort. How do we have to tell them that how are we on a better part than they are? This is the point is. [Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: Well, we have more senses than what a normal person has.

Shri Mataji: What? What do you have?

Sahaja Yogi: More senses we have developed.

Shri Mataji: No, that is, that is, supposing they don’t know about it, that you cannot convince them. Not [related/relative] to you also, if you have to just tell them what has gone wrong. See, what you have to say that, supposing the way we have developed would have been all right, the human beings would have become better human beings. In these thirty years’ time, thirty years back human beings were much better than they are today. We are, we have become so violent. I mean, in this New York now city you can’t go alone anywhere, with the purse in your hand, you see. But thirty years back it was possible. Thirty years back you could go in any park, into any park. Nobody would murder you.

So if this material life has given you any satisfaction, materially if you are better off, then why people are stealing? They are corrupt. They are trying to cheat. Why, if you were going the right way? We have to become better people in the sense we should be more compassionate, more understanding, of a nature that is congenial to everyone. We should become people of greater wisdom, but there is no wisdom in modern life; there’s no logic. With the science, what have we achieved is an atom bomb. We have put there like a devil, sitting there, one atom bomb, carbon bomb, hydrogen bomb, this bomb, that bomb, to be blasted any day. People are just waiting to put their finger on the button.

So, to say that we have advanced is a wrong idea. It’s a myth, because human being has not ascended. Primitive man was afraid, say for example, of a tiger. One can understand, but now modern man is afraid of another man. So as human beings our quality has gone down. So whatever we have developed, maybe the matter has improved in quality, but human beings have fallen down. Now we have to improve the quality of human beings. Now, what should we do? So, for that Sahaja Yoga is there. [Hindi] Concrete proof.

Sahaja Yogi: We have to become innocent again.

Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

Sahaja Yogi: We have to become innocent again.

Shri Mataji: Yes, we have to become but that, to get that innocence back you see, how to get, they will ask. Then you say, “There’s a way. We have become ourselves. We have become better people. We were not so good.” Then they will come to you. And our children are going to be much worse than what they are. They will start killing their own parents. I mean, they are already killing so many. So, what life we got, we are giving much worse life to our children. So, in every way, whatever advancement we have made, might have improved the conditions, comfort, or whatever it is, but human beings have not improved. That means these things are not required to improve the conditions of the [human beings].

Human beings are very treacherous these days. You cannot trust anyone. I can tell you, thirty years back you could trust anyone. You had much better friends. You had much better people. Nowadays you can’t even, I mean, a Sahaja Yogi may not be able to trust another Sahaja Yogi. The situation could be that bad. I mean, a saint, imagine saints, born Realized people can smoke, can drink. This is Kali Yuga. So, what have we achieved, this kind of a horrible atmosphere where only satanic forces can reign. That’s proved it, all right? So, we are no more compassionate, we are not sharing, we are not enjoying each other, but after Sahaja Yoga, you get back everything. All right?

Sahaja Yogi: Many things.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.
