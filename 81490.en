Do you have any experience other than just feeling that you knew she was a goddess?

Well, everything changed. Everything completely changed. We had been trying to seek through drugs, and I tried to go to India but luckily had turned back. I'm so grateful for that because I think I would have got lost on the way there. That was literally a few weeks before I met Shri Mataji; I came back. And everything just changed.

It became completely normal what happened with Shri Mataji, and everything else became slightly unreal. I felt, literally, like the earth was this huge, powerful force and that mankind and the concrete were a very thin layer on the top, thinking that they're in some way in charge. I felt from Shri Mataji that she was everything. I can remember that first meeting when she told us which finger related to each chakra. At that point, I felt that she had decided that minute which one it was. And if she then changed her mind, it would change. Because...

What were your experiences internally, physically, viscerally in the first few days? More, I'm saying, were you experiencing vibrations? Were you experiencing clarity of mind? Just a little bit on the physical, mental side.

I was just pinned in bliss. There was no mental or anything like that. I was protected in this bubble. Just... She just put me there. And it's beyond words to say what it was.

We were pretty useless and didn't meditate; we didn't know about meditation. We had a picture of Mother that we pinned on the wall, a black and white photocopy. Pat and I, obviously as brother and sister, were very close, and it made us even closer. I mean, I had watched Pat disintegrate before my eyes before we met Shri Mataji. One of the greatest miracles was her giving me him back because he was on a deadly course.

We stuck together and helped each other, but by drinking tea and eating ice cream. Yeah, we did a lot of that. We weren't very subtle. I mean, Tony is the one who had an altar and thought we were completely useless. But she just pinned me in this place where that was real. And you didn't know that it wasn't. It was different.
