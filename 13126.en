Public Program in the Koningszaal, Artis, Amsterdam, 15th July 1988

NOTE: Sri Mataji travelled by car from Belgium to Holland with the Belgian yogis who lost their way and went into Rotterdam instead of Amsterdam. When they finally arrived at the programme in Amsterdam, the local yogis had explained everything and then started giving realisation.

Just as they got to the Sahasrara chakra, Sri Mataji entered the hall.

Sri Mataji: “I think already some of you have got your realisation. I can feel beautiful vibrations in this place. It’s a great thing that Sahaja Yogis can give realisation; my task would be so much easier.

So, I don’t think I should disturb it now any more, but I would like you to put your hands towards me like this and see if you are feeling the cool breeze in the hands. One may be hot, one may be cold, doesn’t matter, just see if you are feeling the cool breeze in your hands. Any amount of lecture is not going to give realisation. It’s a happening that has to take place.

Will you please also see if you are getting a cool breeze on, or through, your fontanel bone area if you put your hands and bend your head a little. Put the left hand towards me and the right hand on top of the head. Now please put your right hand towards me, like this, and bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out. Once more now, left hand towards Me and the right hand above your head.

Now you have to put both your hands towards the sky and push back your head and just ask a question, three times. You can call me “Mother” or “Shri Mataji”; “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the Chaitanya? Is this the all pervading power of Divine love?” Ask the question three times, whichever you like. (Sri Mataji blowing into the microphone)

Now take down your hands please. Now see for yourself in your hands. Are you feeling the cool breeze? Those who have felt the cool breeze in the hands or on their heads, please raise your hands, both the hands please; both the hands please. Most of you have felt it. (Laughing) Surprising, isn’t it? Such patience! May God bless you. May God bless you.

I was saying that if they are real seekers they will wait and they will get their realisation on the way. Of course, I would like to meet all of you here one by one, if you want to come to the stage. And remember that you are a special category of people. That you have been seeking for ages now. But now you have to respect your self-realisation. I will be happy to meet all of you here, one by one and if you have any questions you can come and ask me here; will be a good idea.

Please come. Come on, come on.

Congratulations! (Laughing) That’s how, you see, that’s how you don’t need me really, isn’t it. You can do it yourself. That is how; I know why I got lost. I wanted to see… Hello, how are you? How are you keeping?

So, may God bless you.

I am sorry I got lost but…”
