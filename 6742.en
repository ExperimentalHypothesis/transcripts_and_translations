I am very happy to see that so many of you did feel the realization and you felt the Spirit. And that's why today I am going to tell you about the Spirit as well as about the two other chakras which we have left out. [Short pause.]
 
The center that is called as Vishuddhi Chakra is placed at the point where your neck joins the torathic body. You'll be amazed that in the Universe, America represents this center. We developed this center within ourselves when the human beings in their evolution raised their head up. That time, these two powers that I showed you yesterday, the power of action and the power of desire, these two cross each other. And it started developing a kind of an institution, like a balloon we can say, as a by-product of using these two powers. By your action you developed your ego, by your conditioning you developed your super-ego. These two institutions met at the point here on top of your head at the fontanel bone area when you grew up up to the twelve years of age. Actually, that's the main time, that is the main time very important in a human development. It's starts very early though, that the fontanel bone area which is very soft in a child, starts getting calcified. Now, by these as I told you, you became an egg or a separate entity, or we could say as one Mister X and Y and Z, and you developed your own independent existence. Now the importance of this center is, that because of this center, we have taken the responsibility upon ourselves. You know that America is known for taking responsibility of the whole world. [Laughter.] At least they talk. They are responsible for the peace of the world, they are responsible for the fraternity of the world, for the collectivity of the world. I mean, your presidents have even said that, poverty anywhere is threat to prosperity everywhere.
