I am very happy to see that so many of you did feel the realization and you felt the Spirit. And that's why today I am going to tell you about the Spirit as well as about the two other chakras which we have left out. [Short pause.]
 
The center that is called as Vishuddhi Chakra is placed at the point where your neck joins the torathic body. You'll be amazed that in the Universe, America represents this center. We developed this center within ourselves when the human beings in their evolution raised their head up. That time, these two powers that I showed you yesterday, the power of action and the power of desire, these two cross each other. And it started developing a kind of an institution, like a balloon we can say, as a by-product of using these two powers. By your action you developed your ego, by your conditioning you developed your super-ego. These two institutions met at the point here on top of your head at the fontanel bone area when you grew up up to the twelve years of age. Actually, that's the main time, that is the main time very important in a human development. It's starts very early though, that the fontanel bone area which is very soft in a child, starts getting calcified. Now, by these as I told you, you became an egg or a separate entity, or we could say as one Mister X and Y and Z, and you developed your own independent existence. Now the importance of this center is, that because of this center, we have taken the responsibility upon ourselves. You know that America is known for taking responsibility of the whole world. [Laughter.] At least they talk. They are responsible for the peace of the world, they are responsible for the fraternity of the world, for the collectivity of the world. I mean, your presidents have even said that, poverty anywhere is threat to prosperity everywhere.

(44:20) Now, this spirit is the aspect of God which is a witness. The God that witnesses the play of His love. The first of all is the state were we call as Parabrahma where everything is just silent and sleeping. When we are sleeping nothing exists for us. In the same way the whole thing like Parabrahma, the abstract, sleeps. Then it comes to its awakened state. Then it gets the desire to create out of love. So, this power of His love spreads around Him, accumulates and form another entity called as the Holy Ghost or you can say the Parashakti or you can call it also as the primordial mother. She is the Holy Ghost. Now, when the break takes place there is a sound and this sound is the logos as you call it the spirit that is... - that sound is the divine integrated sound, not one sound and that one is called as the Omkara which is the child. Which is the child of this couple and that’s how you get the son of God. Now the spirit in us which is represented is that son of God within us which is the part of that… - we can say God almighty’s reflection within us which is the child in our heart. Is the spirit. Is the abstract form of that power which is all pervading is the spirit. Now, this is a combining thing. It has both the things, you can see that because it is from the combination of theses a child is born, so an one side it is the reflection of the God Almighty on the other side it is the connection with the all pervading power which is the power of His love. So it is connected on both the sides. So this spirit is in your heart which resides, is alert all the time and knows all about you. In Gita He is called as ‘Khsetragya’ – the knower of the field. He knows all about you and He knows what you are doing. It just is a witness, it doesn’t involve into the play of what you are doing. Its just watching the whole drama as long as it wants to. Otherwise when it is now fed up or does not want to enjoy anymore it just disappears. When it disappears you do not exist anymore. This spirit has got the nature as I told you in the morning – as Sat-Chit-Ananda.

Sat means that when you become the spirit you become the truth. Now, what is the truth? Truth is this all pervading power. You start feeling it. You start feeling the truth. Now this truth is absolute, you get connected with it. Your attention gets enlightened and whatever you know through your attention by paying attention to it, means through your vibrately awareness is the truth. You put ten children together and asks them to feel (about) one person who is facing Me. They will put up the same finger (Shri Mataji shows the first finger) that means something wrong with his throat. Because you become the subject, is not subjective, but you become the subject. You start feeling. Everybody feels the same. Now you have seen these people who have come to help Me from Australia and Switzerland and England and all this places. When you come to Me they say the same thing about a person. He is catching on this, he is catching on that, everybody catches on the same.

So this all pervading power is a complete organization of delivering truth to you. You ask any questions to it. Whether it is true or not you will know on your vibrately awareness. Of course in the beginning you have to develop the sensitivity. Once you are sensitive to it you can find out the truth. So the ‘Sat’ that part means the brain gets enlightened. Your central nervous system gets enlightened that means the spirit gives light into central nervous system and you start feeling it flowing. First time it comes to your consciousness. What ever people may tell you that this is the way we give self-realization and all that, just don’t believe it. You must know that you should have the sensitivity of feeling that spirit and that truth which is common to all of you. That it cannot be denied. Truth is only one it can not be hundreds. Once you realize all of them talk the same. There is no difference. But the problem is human being know how to make a pickles out of everyone. (49:39) That’s the speciality of human beings. 
Anybody who came on this earth who was a realized soul said the same thing, there is no difference whatsoever. But everybody started fighting about it. Like the real flowers appear on the tree. When they are living they are beautiful, fragrant and they know each other. There is no difference between them. But somebody will take out one, another will take out another. They say: ‘This is mine, this is mine’, then they are dead and they say this is. When Christ lived nobody recognized Him. They crucified Him. Even His disciples till they get their resurrection. Then whats the use? Nobody recognized Him. All the great people who came here, nobody recognized Him. Christ has said: ‘Whatever you have done to Me, it will be forgiven, but not to the Holy Ghost.’ Because the Holy Ghost has to give you your realization and when you get your realization you have to recognize it. If you don’t recognize that will not be forgiven. After realization you have to recognize. If you do not recognize He says it wont be forgiven. 

A very, very great understanding is needed to understand what is today such a precarious time. The last judgement has started. So many great people are taking birth. So many crooks are taking birth to harm you. Its happening. How will you judge yourself? How will you judge? Are you going to put on a – what you call – a balance? Your Kundalini is going to be awakened. You yourself will judge, not necessary for anybody to judge. You yourself will know: ‘Mother I’m catching on this, Mother I’m catching on that.’ Today only one of the Sahaja yoginis says: ‘Mother, I’m catching on the right heart.’ All right, we’ll work it out. Another one will say: ‘I’m catching on my Agnya!’ Yesterday somebody was telling Me: ‘Mother, take out this bhoot from my Agnya.’ Now, Agnya means ego. They can feel it. They can see it and they judge it, because they are out of it. The spirit gives you the truth and you like it, because the vibrations flow and you feel so peaceful and so happy and so joyous and you can feel others. When the vibrations are not there, you feel ‘what's wrong with it?’ You should put it right and when you know the method how to do it, you want to do it and you want to be that. The joy of the spirit though really felt in a big way comes later on but it starts trickling in. People give up all kinds of habits automatically. I don’t tell them. They just give up. The will power is so great, that whatever you want you can give up. There is no problem with it. So many people who use to take drugs and were ‘druggist’ and ‘chemist’ I use to call them. When they came to Me, some of them came in coma. They just came up without any difficulty. Because if you discover your spirit you just do it. A transformation has to take place within you. If that doesn’t happen it is no religion, it is no God, it has nothing to do with your Kundalini. And when it takes you become so empowered that nothing can dominate you. No habit can dominate you, no guru can dominate you, no ideas and fixations an all these smaller thing will dominate. But you become so powerful that you start emitting light to others and people can see that light in you, that confidence in you. 
Now the chitta. Chitta means attention. Your attention becomes enlightened. You put your attention to anything and you can feel it. You can find out about anyone you want. Your president you can find out where he is catching. You can even correct him sitting down here quite a lot. But he has to ask for realization. All this people have to ask for realization, though you can little bit sort of mould them. But your attention becomes very different because your priorities changes. You are not interested in your brothers and sisters only. You are interested in everyone. If you find your brothers and sisters are not interested in God in the real way you just give up. You don’t bother your heads. Then you find out people who are really interested, work on them and give them. So your attention itself becomes. This attention has got all telecommunication and everything. Now, somehow the great miracles people have seen by becoming realization are so great that again it is not proper at this time to tell them. But I would say that once you get realized you don’t get into accidence. If one person is realized in a car even if there is an accidence due to other people you don’t get hurt at all. 

There was one gentleman called Rajesh Shah whom – actually he is the one who came to Barcley University who met Gregoire and that’s how I started taking interest in the eastern people. He is the one who was – he had given up everything but he used to - his friends one day told him that lets drive and why don’t you smoke, why don’t you smoke so he had taken a smoke in his hand and as he had taken it there was an accident. He was driving. A  very bad accident and everybody was saved but only this finger was hurt (Shri Mataji shows the right forefinger). This finger was hurt, that’s all and he told Me: ‘Mother…’ Its so many miracles happen like once see in India there was a drought. In Bombay there was not a single drop of water and Rajesh was so much worried and he telephoned to Me: ‘Mother there is no water. Why are You angry? What has happened? There is no water at all.’ I said: ‚All right, you will have water, doesn’t matter. You want to have rain, you will have it. And that night it rained so heavily from where God alone knows. I mean everything can work out because all the angles are with you, all the Jiranjivas are with you, all the elements are with you. Even you can find out from the candle. If you work on the candle you will find some of you it will get like a sort of pulsation in it. Sometimes you will find a lot of black soot will come out. So much soot that the whole wall may become black. That’s the black coming out of you. Don’t be afraid, let it come out. Sometimes it will going to tension. You will see even this little candle can burn lots of negativity form you people. The water element helps you, every element helps you. The whole stage of this creation is made for you. But you should have your self-esteem and not your ego then it works out. Everything is for you and is has to work out. (56:28)

(1:24:48): When you take a new house always try one testing, all right! There is a way to test it, you see. You light one of these incense. Any incense takes, you see. If the thing rises straight on, then it’s a good house, no problem. But if it spreads all over then think its not a good house, all right. This is one of the grandmother’s medicines.
