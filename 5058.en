b'Practical session with Sahaja yogis, Bramham Court Ashram, Brahmam Gardens, London, UK, 29th October 1981.\n\nShri Mataji: All right? Good, good. How are you? How is the Baby?\n\nYOGINI: It feels good.\n\nSHRTI MATAJI: [Shri Mataji laughs] Hmm. Yeah. How to keep the [INDIST.]. Hallo! We give a Bandhan. Really I have forgotten. What was that about? Hmm? [to the Baby:] No, no, no, nolu, nolu, hoho. Hoho, oh ho. [all laugh] Oh. Oh. Oh. Haha. Haha. [all laugh] Aha. Haa? Aha, haa \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nBABY: Hm. [all laugh]\n\nShri Mataji: He like it. [Baby breezes loudly]\nYesterday\xe2\x80\x99s picture upset Me so much, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep the whole night. Horrifying - in one city there are three thousand children on the list who are battered and out of which every week six are killed. Can you imagine? Six are killed every week \xe2\x80\x93 I mean shame-full it is, I tell you. I used to think in the whole of England. It is only in one city. In Birmingham I think it was. Three-thousand children on the list and every week six are killed.\n\nYogi: Now what use to work for the NSPCC Mother? The national, that is the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children.\n\nShri Mataji: Ah, where?\n\nYogi: And my wife used to work for them and \xe2\x80\xa6.\n\nShri Mataji: Where was that?\n\nYOGINI: In London but it [INDIST.] country.\n\nShri Mataji: Ah?\n\nYOGINI: [INDIST.] here to London [INDIST.]\n\nShri Mataji: In London it is a?\n\nYogi: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: It\xe2\x80\x99s hor- \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nYOGINI: [INDIST.]\n\nShri Mataji: \xe2\x80\xa6 just imagine!\n\nYogi: There branch is all over the country, Mother, and they cannot called, and they were on one point a million pounds in that because they cannot call with all the children they have to care for.\n\nShri Mataji: Yes, and they showed some children, it\xe2\x80\x99s such a mess I tell you. Why I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep last night, the whole night I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\n\nANOTHER Yogi: Some of the cases, Mother, which is horrifying. Children who have been taken by their mothers and there was a picture of one child who had been burned with the bars with an electric fire. The mother had taken the child and done this to it. Others were they had boiling water pulled on them. One child who had a father who had taken a cigarette on the child, had marks all over its body. This \xe2\x80\x93 I mean \xe2\x80\x93 and that is not rare, I cannot say that is \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Where I told you, how can they do it? What sort of parents these are? They are off their heads completely. Completely off their heads I tell you. One there was one girl, she battered the boy so much and then the boy was recovered and all that - so sweetly came back to her, loved her and kissed her \xe2\x80\x93 you know \xe2\x80\x93 he had forgiven here completely, such a sweet thing and how can they do it? I just can\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\n\nYogi: When one hears about it, Mother. Nay. You look at small children who are cracking, I mean these children are cracked.\n\nShri Mataji: So small as that!\n\nANOTHER Yogi: Now children like this, children weeks old even, Children smaller then Greg, yeah as nice as \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Where have they done that?\n\nYogi: [breezes loudly]\n\nShri Mataji: But why do they do it?\n\nYogi: Not feeding them, starving them in cases were the children have been starved.\n\nShri Mataji: But why, why do they, what do they say, what is the reason?\n\nYOGINI: They don\xe2\x80\x99t know the reason, they say it\xe2\x80\x99s emotional things but they don\xe2\x80\x99t, [INDIST.] like the husband told her [INDIST.].\n\nYogi: If the husband is left, you know, the woman left to call the children and quiet often is that point [INDIST.]\n\nShri Mataji: But in one case yesterday the husband he was looking like a rakshasa, I tell you. And it was the husband who was beating the child. And he was put in jail and came out and another child was to be born and they said the wife cannot stay with it. So he said, why not I have seen people breaking the rips of the children and they are still there. And why me of all the thing? Horrible! It\xe2\x80\x99s real hell I tell you.\n\nYogi: And they get away with the mother in many, many cases. Ah there is one parent - \xe2\x80\xa6.\n\nShri Mataji: This is the maximum here I believe. In America they don\xe2\x80\x99t have this much. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they - \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nYogi: They have it, but \xe2\x80\xa6 I mean the scale how much is going on in this country is \xe2\x80\xa6 sort of a crime.\n\nShri Mataji: What happened to people, are their hearts frozen?\n\nYogi: It\xe2\x80\x99s because, in most cases resent of the child, the parents might resent the child, so they hate them at the end. The child is vulnerable, you know, people who have hate-feelings in them, they have a small child, who is defenseless and they take it out on the child. This is \xe2\x80\xa6.\n\n[Baby breezes loudly]\n\nSHRI MATAJI: Oh God. Oh God, [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: what is it?]. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep the whole night, I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bare it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I used to think two children in the whole week in England was too much for Me, but it\xe2\x80\x99s in one place? And in one place!\n\n[Baby breezes loudly and makes a little noise]\n\n[to the Baby:] Better. You get enough, you are pet enough. You are pet enough. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? You are pet enough. Ah, aha, ah. How much better? Hm. Hm.\n\n[Baby breezes loudly and makes a little noise]\n\nHe is holding his head.\n\nYogi: Hm. He is, he is trying to sit up [INDIST.].\n\nShri Mataji: Hm. [baby breezes] He is all right now. He is all right. I have cooled him\ndown on the head. I have cooled him down.\n\n[Baby breezes loudly and makes a little noise]\n\nThis is on the increase, that\xe2\x80\x99s the main point.\n\n[Baby makes some noise]\n\nMust be possessed I think this people! They have no heart.\n\nYogi: So I just can\xe2\x80\x99t understand how someone can do it. I mean, looking at my son, my daughter \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the matter how angry I feel, when I could be made very angry, I could see a wrong somewhere, I mean many times I felt hate, but I mean how can you take out on tiny children. [Baby breezes loudly] I did not understand [Shri Mataji laughs to the baby] how anger you feel, you know the child, the children -\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\nShri Mataji: I mean, you see, I feel more, I agree with this people the way they are behaving than anything else. How can children be born here? Just [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: think it]! What a place it is.\n[Baby breezes loudly] [to the baby:] It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Now better? All right? How much is that? Gail, if you go and ask that boy, that while cleaning My room, please open the window, because you see hermetical I felt for three days. [Shri Mataji laughs] You are better. You still off? Who is the [INDIST.]? Really? [all laugh]\n\nYOGINI: Come on Greg.\n\nYogi: Yeahh!\n\nShri Mataji: It\xe2\x80\x99s all right now, have it.\n\nYogi: Ah! Ah!\n\nANOTHER Yogi: Mister [INDIST.] just come back from shopping.\n\nShri Mataji: Oh I see.\n\nYogi: And then ah \xe2\x80\x93\n\nShri Mataji: [to the baby: ] Hello! Hello! [Shri Mataji laughs] Now, lalalalala there. Not there. Not there. Not there. Not there. You are all right.\nNow the dilatation of the people have taken place \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s all right \xe2\x80\xa6\n[to the baby:] Yes! Yes! What has happened now, are you all right? Are you all right? You want to come now? Now come, you want to come to Me, ah? First you were crying, now you want to come to Me. You felt very cool and nice? Did you? [Shri Mataji laughs] How are you? All right? [Shri Mataji laughs] Now you are laughing, now you are laughing, now knowing, otherwise he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know before. Ha? What was it? You want to come to Me? [Shri Mataji laughs] Trying to come to Me? All right? How many children have I to carry now in a program? [all laugh] Like jail- [INDIST.] she goes on crying till I take her. And now - oohohh. [all laugh] So, let\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 ah \xe2\x80\x93 I want to have something practical. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have it. Please sit down. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t? [Yogis laugh, Shri Mataji too]\n\n[to a Baby:] Hello! Hello!\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s better now. A little caught up on the left, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. Left side. Ah, you don\xe2\x80\x99t go to any psychologist or anyone, nothing like that, never? You don\xe2\x80\x99t go near \xe2\x80\xa6 the tradition is not then, may seem [INDIST.] but it is tradition and if you, if you had the tradition \xe2\x80\x93 like We have in India \xe2\x80\x93 to their fitted just like [Shri Mataji snaps], that\xe2\x80\x99s what happens. Once they get their realization they know it is realization, like you must say it that day, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? He said, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a setting we have got, We just find the diamond that is setted there. That\xe2\x80\x99s the thing We see there and ego comes up and the rigid because they can\xe2\x80\x99t accept Me as anything, but as Christians you can talk to them that Christ has said, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a Comforter and a Councilor and a Redeemer. You should say these are the three qualities Mother has. She is a Comforter and She is also a Councilor and She is a Redeemer. She has redeemed so many people. And these three qualities are nothing but Mahakali, Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmis \xe2\x80\x93 they are the three qualities. So He said it in His own style and that\xe2\x80\x99s how We interpreted in our own style but this is what it is. And if that is so, then why to reject? I mean, Christ has said that, nothing against Her will be tolerated.\n\nYogi: Seems to be like You mentioned recently, some people will come and then they might have a stomach-pain or they might have a problem and they, and they come and You make them well again and they go away and then the next year they come back and they say, Mother we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe, but make us well. It is it people are coming to You \xe2\x80\xa6 [Shri Mataji laughs] \xe2\x80\xa6 for a little while \xe2\x80\xa6 Do you made to feel happy? And \xe2\x80\xa6 but you know well \xe2\x80\xa6 thanks! \xe2\x80\xa6 and close your mind again [Shri Mataji laughs a lot].\n\nShri Mataji: That\xe2\x80\x99s typically western you know?\n\nYogi: Yes. People go away and they think about it. They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in it and enjoying it, they go away, they think about it.\n\nShri Mataji: What can you think? You see, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get well by thinking. What we should do, give them a big Mantra is: Don\xe2\x80\x99t think! Don\xe2\x80\x99t think! Don\xe2\x80\x99t think!\n\n[Yogis laugh]\n\nYogi: Like the children.\n\nShri Mataji: I think that would be a good idea. You see, so many people have come \xe2\x80\x93 I tell you \xe2\x80\x93 and so many have got their realization, but how many have stayed is the point. Actually, in Sahaja Yoga it is easy to get realization, no doubt \xe2\x80\x93 but to maintain it and to rise is not so simple as you think it and We have to work it out. Ah though Kundalini helps you a lot, but still you have to work it out. In the Vedas you should see these people are called as, human beings are called as Pashus. Pashus means the ones which are under bondage. Actually the animals name is the same \xe2\x80\x93 Pashus. So they are under bondage of their problems like temper, lust, greed, hatred \xe2\x80\xa6 They are under the bondage of all these things, under the bondage of their senses. Now when they are realized, then their eyes open. That\xe2\x80\x99s called as [INDIST.], their eyes are open. Now so they get a new category of people, you see now they start feeling the collective. That\xe2\x80\x99s called as samaschty. So the individual which is bound is opened out, but after that \xe2\x80\x93 you see \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only Shakti, the power on which one can live. You have to develop other powers which are under line and the power underlying us is to get over this first bondage is and that getting over is also sort of manifes-, it is many fold. When you start getting over it, you don\xe2\x80\x99t realize how many powers you have got. You have got the power to enter into the body of another person, otherwise how do you know, what another person has got? You see your Aura can enter into another personality and can feel another personality, the vibrations of that person \xe2\x80\x93 imagine! You have a power to enter it, otherwise how can you find out anyone. Now think of a person who is not realized \xe2\x80\x93 can you find out what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him? But we take it for granted, we don\xe2\x80\x99t realize it it\xe2\x80\x99s such a big power you have got. A Siddhi - to enter into the body of another person by which you can feel that person, you can know about that person, you can raise the Kundalini, you can give Realization. Imagine! All these Siddhis, you got all Siddhis in one shot. And people used to work so hard for it and do it. Now if you are made to work very hard for it, then maybe you may realize the value of that. You see but there is no time. Like \xe2\x80\x93 ah - he was telling Me \xe2\x80\x93 David Brawl \xe2\x80\x93 that if you put a big photograph somewhere it could be cheap Mother, but if You consider it and We asked people, put your hands towards, see if the cool breeze is coming? I said, but what it is? There will be no identification with ah, with Me and then that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to work out. See, they have to know that I have done it and they have to identify. This is the condition.\n\n[the baby breezes] Better now? Feeling better?\n\nSo now how many are there coming from that area?\n\nYogi: There are four, there are four of us who regularly come to meetings \xe2\x80\x93 with myself.\n\nShri Mataji: But there you can have a program.\n\nYogi: We are going to, Mother and \xe2\x80\xa6.\n\nShri Mataji: Where is this park, where resides this, this \xe2\x80\xa6.\n\nYogi: Queens-park. It\xe2\x80\x99s North-London, it\xe2\x80\x99s few miles from Hampstead.\n\nShri Mataji: Away?\n\nYogi: Yes. It\xe2\x80\x99s between here and Hampstead.\n\nShri Mataji: Between here and Hampstead?\n\nYogi: Hmm, north of London.\n\nShri Mataji: Is it?\n\nYogi: Hm.\n\nShri Mataji: Ah!\n\nYogi: It\xe2\x80\x99s west of Hampstead.\n\nShri Mataji: It\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x93 say these region to expecting a religion \xe2\x80\x93 how can you expect Rajneesh to be there? Now We have Christ.\n\nYogi: Because this, they are really \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know else, the west as a whole seems to be very mentally orientated, very mentally orientated.\n\nShri Mataji: I [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: may] not. Yesterday only there was a another BBC-Program about what is the death of a man and all that. He said, one side is definitely mechanical in a man, but another is something like morality. You see, We didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it so, We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain everything, so he said that there is something like morality. Now, what We can do is to, Philip, what should I tell you the practical side, the meditation. All right? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what this meditation is, what We have to do on a meditation.\n\nThe first thing we have got is the left side \xe2\x80\x93 you see \xe2\x80\x93 is the Mana-Shakti, is the power of your emotions. All right? Now, emotions are connected with your right side, also - prana. Say for example if you are emotionally disturbed, just now we got disturbed, so our shva, our breathing also increased and we felt the whole body was sort of, say reacting and the, we were feeling the reaction of the Prana, right side also. That it was trying to express itself. Like we started the tears, is the water-element and all that came in and the whole emotion was so much pouring out and with that our Prana was also involved.\n\nSay for example if you are frightened, if you are frightened \xe2\x80\x93 [aside: {INDIST.}, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right] \xe2\x80\x93 if you are frightened too much then what happens? [aside: this is all right] If you are frightened than also you get your breathing very fast \xe2\x80\x93 isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? So it is connected. [aside: Yes, come in, come in!] So it is connected. If you are frightened it is connected \xe2\x80\x93 with your Prana, in your breathing and your whole system is connected with your emotions, physical system. If you cry too much, or if you weep too much, or if you are a sad person - that shows on your face, your Vishuddhi-Chakra also shows, and not only Anahata but also Vishuddhi. Then also your Agnya goes out. So all the Chakras reflect the left side in such a way that physical manifestation is also there. So it proofs that both are very much connected.\n\nSo to, if you have to, somehow or other, dissolve these two sides within us, the left and the right side \xe2\x80\x93 because if you do not dissolve it you are left half way here \xe2\x80\x93 so you have to dissolve these two things. And to dissolve these, what should we do? What can we do \xe2\x80\x93 in meditation?\n\n[aside:] Can you suggest?\n\nSay we have got Prana and Mana. Now Prana represents the right side and the Mana-Shakti is the left side. All right? These two have to be dissolved \xe2\x80\x93 in the air, means dissolved. Now how do we do it? To dissolve these two things, they are connected with each other. After realization, not. So before meditation We give ourselves a balance, all right? Which side is more resided left at the time. Supposing you are emotionally \xe2\x80\x93 at that time \xe2\x80\x93 disturbed, then you put your right to the left. If you are that time disturbed on the left side \xe2\x80\x93 ah, I mean disturbed in that sense that if a left side is frozen, then you raise your left side and give yourself a balance before meditation.\n\nNow let us see, which side is less, first of all. Put your hands like that. Are you all right? Getting cool breeze? Getting it? [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: May this side not.] All right. Better? Are you getting in this side? Now \xe2\x80\x93 something moving? Cool breeze is coming now? Is there a cool breeze? Is it? There is cool breeze in your hand? Are you feeling it? All right.\n\nSo once you have given yourself a balance then the best thing is to pay attention to your emotions, to Manas-Shakti. Watch them. You can enlighten your emotions by thinking of your Mother. All right, just enlighten them. Just She will solve the problem. Whatever are the problems in the Mana, all right? So once you get connected with those emotions and you start looking at them in your meditation you will see these emotions are rising within you and if you try to put these emotions on your Mother, as put at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother, they will start also dissolving those emotions and they\xe2\x80\x99ll become sort of \xe2\x80\x93 ah - expanded. Expanded, you see.\n\nYou will extern that in such a way that, you will feel you are in control, these emotions. You are in control of them and by that controlling those emotions your emotions \xe2\x80\x93 which are expanded, enlightened \xe2\x80\x93 are powerful. And these emotions, when you feel that way, then the cause of those emotions can be solved. For example just now you got emotionally stirred up because I talked about \xe2\x80\x93 say \xe2\x80\x93 these children. Naturally, anybody would be. Now when you are stirred up with that you put that problem and those feelings that are rising in you, that those waves of feelings that are coming at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother.\n\nSo they get touched, say by that power you can say. Then these emotions become enlightened and when these emotions become enlightened they have a power to solve the problem. Do you see the point? As if they had reached the shore where they got the light and this problem can be solved. Because now you are not in an individual self, you are in the expanse, you are in the samashti and because you have entered into that position, that\xe2\x80\x99s why you have got these powers of entering to another person\xe2\x80\x99s body, to see the vibrations of another person, to raise the Kundalini. Otherwise you could not have done it.\n\nSo for you it is very easy to [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: weep] because I am also sitting here in Person. So easy to put these emotions just there so that they get enlightened and your wish is fulfilled, because emotions are nothing but wishes. These are unfulfilled wishes. Now how they do it otherwise is also this way that you take up these emotions and put them, so that is, these emotions are actually - the left side, as I said, is the desire.\n\nSo the desire is taken, any desire, and is put in the Prana. Now how do you put it on the Prana? That you control your Prana \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s why they do Prana-yamas, you see? Like you sit down now, very comfortably, now you have a desire, you put your attention to that. Attention is very important \xe2\x80\x93 you see? Now this attention is to be put onto the Prana, so the emotions are there and then bring those emotions and put them into your attention, means they are now, you are aware of them.\n\nNow what you do is to watch your breathing. See now, try to reduce your breathing, reduce it. In the sense that you have breathed out, wait for a while, then breath in - for a long time. Then you breathe out. So in one minute your breezing will be less than normal. All right? Try that. Breathe in \xe2\x80\x93 now with the emotions, keep the attention on the emotions \xe2\x80\x93 you see? \xe2\x80\x93 so that the connection is established.\n\nHmm. Better? You see the Kundalini rises? Now when you are breathing you find that there is a space in-between, which you just leave it vacant. Breathe in! Now leave it vacant. Now breathe out. Now leave it vacant. Breathe in. Keep it there. Then leave it. Keep out-side. Now breathe in. Now start breathing in such a way that you stop your breathing. Your attention should be on the heart, or could be on the emotions.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s better? Keep the breathing inside for a while, then bring it out, then outside for a while. Then again, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that for a while you will not breathe. Hmm. You see, you settle down. The layer takes place between your Prana and your Mana. Both the Shaktis become one. Now at this stage when you are silent, now you think of your intellect \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s lost. Now just think of it, it\xe2\x80\x99s lost, it\xe2\x80\x99s no more there. So what is happening, actually that this layer \xe2\x80\x93 the attention goes into the intellect and enlightens the intellect.\n\nAha, now see, the thought is not there \xe2\x80\x93 try to find your intellect within yourself! Now see! See, where is my intellect? Try to find it! It\xe2\x80\x99s not there, it\xe2\x80\x99s not working. Again try it! It is working, but it has become the samashti, has become the collective now. Ha! See now! Did you follow that? There is no thought. This exercise will give you this thoughtless awareness, establishes in you the thoughtless awareness. There is no thought. So the second lesson \xe2\x80\x93 all right?\n\nMay God bless you!\n\nHmm. Yesterday I told you about the physical side \xe2\x80\x93 is how to physically achieve the balance by doing all these movements and all that and there is also raising your Kundalini like that and how to put certain chakras in places. Like first of all the Mooladhara, which is very important, Mooladhara Chakra - for that the exercise, as I told you, has to be with both the feet \xe2\x80\xa6 Can We try that again? Just to put both the feet together \xe2\x80\xa6 Now I tried to pull it towards yourself. No, no \xe2\x80\x93 with this, now, holding it, yes, towards yourself and push the thing down \xe2\x80\xa6 Yes \xe2\x80\xa6 [Shri Mataji laughs, the Yogis too] Now, the other way round, the other way round you can do it, is to push it downward and pull your \xe2\x80\x93 with the hands \xe2\x80\x93 you push it down. Yes now, push it up \xe2\x80\x93 the, the heels \xe2\x80\x93 yes, now, push it towards yourself, again, again. Now put it down on the sides.\n\n[Yogis laugh]\n\nIt is stiff, I must say. All right, again. Now I tell you one, you may try another thing for this \xe2\x80\x93 is to put your, one foot across and one foot like this, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. Push it, ha \xe2\x80\xa6 now it\xe2\x80\x99s better, that way \xe2\x80\xa6 now push it up. It is this one, upward, just push it how much you can, push that down \xe2\x80\xa6 yes \xe2\x80\xa6 push one down and one push up, it is better \xe2\x80\xa6 now the other one you do the same way \xe2\x80\xa6 push that down at the center, ha \xe2\x80\xa6 now push that up \xe2\x80\xa6 with one hand you can push that up, with one hand you can push that down \xe2\x80\xa6 would be a better idea \xe2\x80\xa6 now like this, like this, like this \xe2\x80\xa6 just try, now ah \xe2\x80\xa6 hold it from the sides, hold it from the sides, like he is holding \xe2\x80\xa6 no, no, that ha-, that, put it down, your hand, yes. Now hold it this foot with the left hand, with the left hand, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go that side, [Shri Mataji laughs] it\xe2\x80\x99s [Shri Mataji laughs] like the way he is sitting \xe2\x80\xa6 all right, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Now push it, push it down, this one and push that up, push that up and push this down. Now the other one you try, now the other one you try, again.\n\nHmm. Can you? No, no, no \xe2\x80\x93 that one down now. Which one was, yes, correct, correct. Now this is the other way - ha. Just push that one down, as much as you can. Push this down. Now you will see it will little bit opened out. Now see yourself, is it opening out? Now put it, put it down again. See, is it better now for sitting. Better? Now see now, is it better? Like it! [Yogis laugh] It\xe2\x80\x99s better now.\n\nYogi: Now [INDIST.] here.\n\nShri Mataji: Sorry. Yeah. You see, gradually it will work out, gradually it will work out for you people, because you are not used to it, not, so at this age also it\xe2\x80\x99s rather difficult, but it will work out, gradually that - ... You sit like that! From now, if she sits like this, you see, from the very childhood, than she can never sit like that.\n\nYogi: Jane?\n\nShri Mataji: Can you sit like that?\n\nYogi: Does you understand?\n\nShri Mataji: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. If \xe2\x80\x93 can see?\n\nYogi: Shri Mataji is sitting before you \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Ah?\n\nYogi: \xe2\x80\xa6 so be like [INDIST.] go meditating.\n\nShri Mataji: Ha good, you can do it, you are good, excellent, she is good. Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s better.\n\nYogi: They are very subtle, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: They are subtle, but you see, that\xe2\x80\x99s how you grow up and then when you do not, you give up this habit, as you start sitting on a chair, then you give up the habit and then the chair becomes, you see, \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nYogi: But the way she was sitting, I cannot sit. Only she was sitting [INDIST.] like that and she sits right [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: like that on the floor] \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Yes\n\nYogi: \xe2\x80\xa6 and she has legs out there. [Shri Mataji laughs] It\xe2\x80\x99s just [breathes loudly] It\xe2\x80\x99s really strange [INDIST.] legs.\n\nShri Mataji: Children are very subtle. Now then, this is one thing I told you how to improve your Mooladhara yesterday \xe2\x80\x93 all right? Now the second thing was about the Swadhishthana, you have to hold both the legs together, like this. Try to push it together. So, now, push it like that. Hold the hands and just turn, just try to take out the heat of [Shri Mataji laughs] \xe2\x80\xa6 turn it \xe2\x80\xa6 [Shri Mataji laughs more, then the Yogis laugh loudly] He is tall, is he? See that! [Shri Mataji laughs] Now, is all right, now you turn on, on the water like this here. The tall people are [Shri Mataji laughs] rather difficult.\n\nANOTHER Yogi: Like the thin ones legs, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Yes, now see, that\xe2\x80\x99s how, now you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, your Swadhishthana will improve. Hmm, just more. You see? Now let us see, now put your hands towards Me, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. You see? It improves. Swadhishthana improves like that.\n\nThen I told yesterday about, how to raise the Kundalini of others with a light in your hand. Now you don\xe2\x80\x99t have lights today, but you can take some lights. There are some lights, you can take from that, some candles, all of you. You can get some plates, but the doors are closed now. You can get it from upstairs, also get Me a glass of water.\n\nYOGINI: [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: Mother, we have provided some water, but this is not chilled.]\n\nShri Mataji: Here! All right. Thank you, thank you very much. [Shri Mataji eats something] Hmm.\n\nYogi: [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: Is it a good idea \xe2\x80\xa6]\n\nShri Mataji: You like that?\n\nANOTHER Yogi: [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: I just can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\xa6]\n\nANOTHER Yogi: Is it a [INDIST.] decision to like this position not?\n\nShri Mataji: Is she bringing some plates?\n\nYogi: Is it a good idea to sit in the lotus-position, Mother?\n\nShri Mataji: Hmm?\n\nYogi: Is it a good idea to sit in the lotus, lotus position? [INDIST.]\n\nShri Mataji: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want, it\xe2\x80\x99s too much, sometimes. For meditation you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. For exercise is all right, but not for meditation. In meditation: sahaj-asana. Sahaj-asana is when both the legs are absolutely spread out as much as you can. Very much like that, very comfortable. It should be a comfortable position. That is the [INDIST.].\n\nYogi: Mother, we have to go.\n\nShri Mataji: Hmm. You have to go now?\n\nYogi: Yes, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: All right \xe2\x80\xa6I must say, \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nYogi: We have to go now.\n\nShri Mataji: \xe2\x80\xa6 what \xe2\x80\x93 ah \xe2\x80\x93 David [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: Browled] told Me that if you go to these People, TM-People they take three years to make you into a teacher and they make a real showman-ship out of that, a real showman-ship.\n\nBABY: Papey!\n\nShri Mataji: Bye Bye! Bye Bye! So don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, it will work out, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to train you up to have a real Guru-style and behavior.\n\nYogi: Yes. We have a meeting in Queens-Park \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Ha?\n\nYogi: \xe2\x80\xa6 coming soon. We have a meeting pretty soon. The Hampstead-meeting, is it the twelfth?\n\nYOGINI: But we can\xe2\x80\x99t have the hall in Hampstead next Thursday, so I projected they had one in Queens-Park next Thursday.\n\nYogi: So is it \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: All right.\n\nYogi: \xe2\x80\xa6 the following is out there.\n\nYOGINI: The twelfth.\n\nYogi: The twelfth.\n\nYOGINI: The twelfth. Oh it\xe2\x80\x99s twelfth \xe2\x80\x93 sorry.\n\nYogi: So what the meeting, the Hampstead-meeting is moving to Queens-Park for one evening.\n\nShri Mataji: Oh they are good. But you must advertise and must make some hand-bills. These people will go \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nYogi: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: Na?\n\nYogi: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: That\xe2\x80\x99s on Thursday-when?\n\nYogi: That\xe2\x80\x99s Thursday the twelfth, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Twelfth \xe2\x80\x93 I can\xe2\x80\x99t see Thursday.\n\nYogi: Two weeks from tonight, two weeks from tonight.\n\nShri Mataji: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be there. In two weeks I won\xe2\x80\x99t be there. Next week I will be \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n[GAP]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6 so seekers. One type is only for them-selves, they are seeking, you see, as long as they get their realization. But some have this Guru-Principle in them, they do it for the whole, you see? But most of them are at that level, we have got it now, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. But even for yours sake you have to come to the meetings. Everybody cannot be thought all these things, you see, but they have to come to the meetings, even for their own sake I am saying, even for sickness. They are cured, but they can be again very sick or something else. So even for sickness they have to come, to the meetings they have to come. But the people who will work out from the angle of being use-full to others will be less in number. This all-pervading Power itself is the one that is in a principle is the collective compassion and if you are not that, then you have not achieved much. You have to do for others, if you are doing only for yourself then it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use.\n\nDid you take the candle now? How are you? With a candle? All right? Better now.\n\n[GAP]\n\nAnd this is all because of this Hippy-Business I tell you. All these drugs, it\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible thing, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very bad thing, one has to work it out. First of all it makes you extremely lazy I say and insensitive. Insensitivity is the first thing. You see, you can be very, very dirty, filthy \xe2\x80\x93 you won\xe2\x80\x99t feel it. Others feel it, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Hippies in India are so obnoxious, the Indians are frightened.\n\nI heard two of them, they came when I was in Bombay, no, in Delhi, first time. Now they are lost, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where they have gone. One of them was [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: Archie] from Sweden or something, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. And they were smelling so bad, absolutely smelling! They don\xe2\x80\x99t wash their hands, they have no sense of cleanliness, nothing. And for anyone to live with a person like that it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely [INDIST.], they are just like primitive people. Even primitive one are much more clean. They can\xe2\x80\x99t go to that limit.\n\nAnd when it becomes a group, then God save others! I mean they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see this, when they are Hippies they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see it. Till they come to Sahaja Yog\xe2\x80\x99 they will not even be able to know that it is so. You agree with Me? It\xe2\x80\x99s a very funny cult I tell you. And they all group together and they justify each other - I mean from one extreme to another extreme. [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: Over-meticulousness, over-, over-cleanliness,] over-this thing and [INDIST.].\n\nYogi: Superiority is also \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Ah?\n\nYogi: Superiority as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of Ego, I think.\n\nShri Mataji: Hm? They think so, they think our whole mind is in the spirit, we are not material things, they think. I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s all connected. Look at the nature, how clean it is. How cl-, who cleanses it? You go in any forest, any place, it\xe2\x80\x99s all very, very clean. Who looks after that, who washes it? And these, this is so unnatural, absolutely unnatural behavior to live like animals, worse than animals it is. They don\xe2\x80\x99t take their bath \xe2\x80\x93 ah \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s all there.\n\n[aside:] But there \xe2\x80\xa6.\n\nThey will have lots of psychological problems, I tell you. Because if you take abnormally something, thinking which is a good thing, you develop such terrible problems psychological. It\xe2\x80\x99s a ego-stuff, it\xe2\x80\x99s a ego-stuff I think. I went to this Santa Cruz and the way people were there some of them \xe2\x80\x93 horrifying! One fellow came, he took out most of his clothes and he was smelling like that, his mouth was smelling, his body was smelling \xe2\x80\x93 just like a tiger I should say. Tiger is better, just I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand, he is a human being, educated fellow.\n\nAnd We went to have lunch with some persons, it was before Santa Cruz, we went that \xe2\x80\x93 do you remember? \xe2\x80\x93 that place We went to, for lunch \xe2\x80\xa6. I was sitting on a, on a bench \xe2\x80\x93 you see - and the whole thing was so stinking, because somebody has set there. We had to change the urge. How -, one must get rid of it, one must develop sensitivity to it.\n\nUntidiness \xe2\x80\x93 I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand, look at God, God is so tidy. He has made His Nose, His Eyes, everything so nicely, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And they are not spiritual. I can tell you, [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: this way is also with stomach], because I have seen now Hippies, they can be very, very materialistic. They are very worried about their belongings, they are very miserly, they can live on others money, they\xe2\x80\x99ll rob their -, they can do anything, because they have no self-respect.\n\nSo I mean one should also see the bad things of this cult. The good thing is there, because they are not aggressive, maybe like the other side is, but there another side is horrifying. Like two types of devil, right sided I call as [INDIST.] you see and the left sided as rakshasas. And they can become rakshasas! And they can do any kind of [INDIST.] thing, any kind of [INDIST.] thing. Some of them are indulging into horrible things in India, horrible things.\n\nRajneesh has got all that lost, that kind. Gutters, absolutely gutters \xe2\x80\x93 as the worms in the gutters don\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything dirty they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel. You see rajneesh has this thing now, he has got the film, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be eat, able to eat your food for three days. Everything done on mass-level! You see, when I am saying all that it is coming up.\n\nNow another thing is, they dress up also like that, in rags. They dress up in rags, you see, like beggars on the street and their clothes will be absolutely what you can call them dirty, anti-clean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to call, what color. And this is just laziness, simple laziness I tell you. And they wear something angora because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to exert at all. Lazy lumps! But the bhuts are there of the same style and they catch hold of it. I would say all the hippies must throw away all their clothes, most of them which are like that, it will help. It will definitely help.\n\nYou have many like this?\n\nYOGINI: [INDIST.]\n\nShri Mataji: Throw them away! Just throw them away! Please don\xe2\x80\x99t keep them. Try to select clothes which are more clean-looking \xe2\x80\x93 all right? You can have only three or four, need not have many \xe2\x80\x93 throw away the rest of them! I mean the whole tendency is towards that, they think they look like saints, while wearing this nonsense, they are just like beggars in India. Our Indian beggars dress up the same way. I can understand, because they want to beg \xe2\x80\x93 so they wear such clothes that excites pity, you see, so very dirty clothes, they\xe2\x80\x99ll wear some kinds of rags, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have thorn clothes \xe2\x80\x93 but here the very well educated go in for that, for what?\n\nAlso, may be, that they want to show that \xe2\x80\x93 you see \xe2\x80\x93 they are very humble people, maybe that. Or to excite the pity of others \xe2\x80\xa6. It\xe2\x80\x99s a masochist this style of behavior. They just to excite, everybody should feel, oh what a poor thing. The whole behavior is like that, they are too intelligent and they work it out, I tell you. I was amazed, hair never combed, never properly done, little lices in their hair, horrible! And big beard \xe2\x80\xa6. I mean, do you think God likes such people. This is a miss-understanding, these people.\n\nProphets, which Prophet was like this, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I have not known of any Prophet who looked horrible like this. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, which one they are saying. The very best thing is all of them should use oil. That\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing. Let them start using oil. Oil the body, oil the head \xe2\x80\x93 oil! Then these bhoots will run away. That Santa Cruz-crowd was -, We had a, We had a gentleman, a Sikh-gentleman with Us, who was extremely upset, you know, that why should Mother come to this crowds. He said, I should not put My Foot down there, this one, you remember? He was very upset, it\xe2\x80\x99s all [INDIST.] and they should not have brought Me there.\n\nAnd very ill-mannered, extremely jerky type and there is no fines about it, there is no \xe2\x80\x93 I mean - sophistication. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say it should be artificial, but we are human beings, we cannot be like animals, you see, the way the animals like it. When they slap, they rememb-, they were, remind Me of a bear. Have you seen a bear slapping? [Yogis laugh] And when they, it just comes, [Yogis laugh] stands before you, can you do like that? Finished! [Shri Mataji laughs] Turned down! No mental activity! When they clap also they [Shri Mataji claps] go on like this, you see? Just like [Yogis laugh] a monkey, just like a monkey, [Shri Mataji claps all the time] you know, looking at one side. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they are doing.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s idiotic I tell you. [Shri Mataji laughs] Every way! I mean they are seekers, that\xe2\x80\x99s why they are important, but how can seekers go about like this in a group and all these mad people must understand, they\xe2\x80\x99ll become lunatics, really. They are in for it, because all the lunatics will jump on them. I have seen certain lunatics with those pants, you know, baggy pants, exactly like hippies. If you put a hippy and a lunatic you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to [INDIST.] [Yogis laugh] I mean there is no difference at all, in any way!\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Santa Cruz, you know? One lunatic came in, he looked like a hippy [Yogis laugh] and now see, how he was, I said now, you are not getting realization, I am sorry, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, it works on. He said, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s has to work out now. And we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was wearing a wig, you see? Took out the wig and there was a big bald head below that. He said, you better give me now. But We some or another tried to get rid of him and he went at the back of it. And then the [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: goat] was standing there, there was some sort of a dog, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened and he just hit [INDIST.] [Shri Mataji snaps with the fingers] Went into that!\n\nHe was a mad man, he was absolutely mad, but among all the hippies he was lost, We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out that he was mad. He came from a lunatic asylum, from a mental hospital and We could not \xe2\x80\x93 they said if you tell him, he went to the police, what is there, they\xe2\x80\x99ll put him in the mental home. Because they all hippies looked the same, how are We to make out, who is mad, who is not? And another one took out all his clothe and sitting in such a funny manner, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to look at him.\n\nAll strange people, you know? I mean you are seekers, you must have self-esteem. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t take their bath, imagine, they don\xe2\x80\x99t take their bath! God cannot like people who do not take their bath. It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple thing I must tell you. Even, nobody will like, you tell Me Jeremy, supposing somebody is smelling, will they like it? You see. Only rajneesh may\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\nSo one should pay attention to ones own being. After all, if you have to go to God, I mean, supposing you have to go to the temple, the women will wear their best Saris, as you have to present yourself to God, to show that gratitude, that we are so happy, that you have given us this world. But if you go like this, like beggars, what does it mean? What does that mean? That there is no sense of gratitude in your heart\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\nAnd they\xe2\x80\x99ll wear all their ornaments, if they have to go to the temple, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take their silver out, put everything, decorate all the offerings in that silver Thali like that and carry it \xe2\x80\xa6. It looks so beautiful, going to a temple. A woman going to a Temple in India is so beautiful. She takes out all her things, combs her hair nicely and [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: goes]. The best Sari you should wear. We do in the church, I mean, most of the ladies and men go there just to see the clothes only. [Yogis laugh]\n\nYogi: And the bhoots.\n\nShri Mataji: I [INDIST.].\n\nYogi: And the bhoots Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: And the?\n\nYogi: And the bhoots.\n\nShri Mataji: And the bhoots. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. But at least, thanks God, people will wear proper dresses. Otherwise if the hippies go to the church, I think the bhoots will run away. [Yogis laugh] It\xe2\x80\x99s a very funny cult! I mean, I want to condemn it out and out, absolutely! The cult is wrong, all the Sahaja Yogis who are coming from that, just throw it away. Like as We say Catholicism or any kind of \xe2\x80\x93 ah \xe2\x80\x93 fanaticism is wrong, in the same way this fanaticism of hippy-ism is absolutely wrong. Is going to destroy you all completely and is good for nothing.\nFelicity is another person who is gone into this nonsense. Worst is Jane, worst is Jane. The person who was really come out of it, among girls, is Maureen. Really come out of it! Even the dress and all that. Pamela, see Pamela, look at her! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know when she is sane, when she is insane. It\xe2\x80\x99s true. Untidiness - is the sig-, untidiness is the sign of a person who is untidy inside. It\xe2\x80\x99s very nice to say, we are spiritual \xe2\x80\x93 the spirit is so clean. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require anything, I mean even if I don\xe2\x80\x99t take bath for three month you won\xe2\x80\x99t have any smell, know that, but I enjoy bathing. Every flower bathes in the dews, the dew that drops in, waits for it.\n\nYou understand now? It\xe2\x80\x99s very abnormal, it\xe2\x80\x99s very abnormal, it\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible thing, is \xe2\x80\x93 I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s like doing TM. There you pay for it to get a bhoot. And in this you just become a bhoot without paying. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only difference. I mean if children see you, the hippies, in their real way, they would run away. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say all these things before, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to frighten people, because they get angry if You say that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, I tell you. But why are you not to [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: assume] that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, what is again?\n\nI mean you have to be thank-full to God \xe2\x80\x93 or not? How the flowers come out in their better, best dress, the whole nature comes out in such a beautiful way, even if they have ripped up all their flower-, their, their leaves during autumn, still they look so beautiful. Even when it is so great, it is so nice.\n\nThis hippies look just like walking devils, I tell you, sometimes. Like the dead bodies have come out of their, walking, ohohoo, like that. Horrible! Better tell people in Brighton, all right? It\xe2\x80\x99s important. As sooner they take to proper dresses, the better it would be. Otherwise the bhoots won\xe2\x80\x99t leave. Bhoots are just standing around, you see, who have got it. First of all take drugs, dress up like a bhoot - is it? \xe2\x80\x93 become lazy. Only thing you have to put \xe2\x80\x9cwelcome bhoots!\xe2\x80\x9d [Shri Mataji laughs, Yogis too] Otherwise you are that, absolutely! That bode is not there, otherwise everything signifies to that. So you all must take up a vow, that you not become dress up like bhoots, we dress up properly and live properly.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what has harmed more then what, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that Gurus have harmed you more or this Hippy-ism has harmed you more, or \xe2\x80\xa6because it\xe2\x80\x99s so mixed up, I will say. Psychologically that Felicity has the problem. Look at this [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: Anna]! She is a eternal problem, eternal problem, what shall I do with her, you all tell Me. Today again a letter has come from Don.\n\nYogi: She has the solution in her hands, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Hmm?\n\nYogi: She has the solution in her hands, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: But that\xe2\x80\x99s what, they are insensitive, not? Here she came, she used all her methods to create a pity for herself, I achieve. And they have no privacy of any kind. See, she discusses everything about her husband, with everyone, it was too much. And then these peoples were frightened back, you know, especially, another reason sympathizing with her and Steve came and told Me, Mother that \xe2\x80\x93 you know \xe2\x80\x93 she is insane, is going to commit suicide \xe2\x80\xa6 [Shri Mataji laughs] \xe2\x80\xa6 and she is going to, she, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to stay in the upper part of the building because she may commit suicide.\n\nActually Hippies like to stay in a, just like a snake you see, inside some sort of a thing. I said, really? Now you better tell her, that is on the fifth floor and when you look about to commit suicide, let us know. They\xe2\x80\x99ll all watch you falling down. If you want to see, have your fall down, but to inform us, before you drop down, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be involved with any police-case. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want, they don\xe2\x80\x99t mind getting into police or anything. Anything is all right, you see, getting there, doing a great revolutionary work by smuggling these drugs into the country. And when I told this Pat, I asked Pat, what is happening so long. [Shri Mataji laughs] She said, Mother I told her, you better jump, Mother has said. She said, ah? [Shri Mataji laughs] I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her. [Shri Mataji laughs] [INDIST.], Mother said so, She says, Mother said, you better jump, would be a good idea and We want to see that. [Yogis laugh] She never jumped, never, not even once. [Yogis laugh]\n\nAnd this fellow was, then, he was about to get her troubles, Pat, helping around, one case. Then she got after Don, and they are not sympathies, he, he, he thought that, poor Lady we must help. When they came to see Me, I said, Don I would like her to die, no doubt. I saw him in the meeting, I saw him very sick. I said I have to go and see some Ladies in the Hotel. They have come from India, just take Me in the car. I sat in the car and such heat coming out from his body. I said [Shri Mataji snaps], what have you been doing? Thin down, absolutely! He said, I am been looking after Anna. I was so angry with him! Now she wants to come back again to [INDIST.].\n\nYogi: She has been in [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: Fullment], through about.\n\nShri Mataji: Ah?\n\nYogi: She has been in Fullment for a time, Fullment mental hospital.\n\nShri Mataji: That\xe2\x80\x99s the place for her. [a Yogini laughs] She should be there. But how is she out?\n\nYogi: She is out now.\n\nANOTHER Yogi: Yes, she is back in home.\n\nShri Mataji: She is back?\n\nYogi: [INDIST.], yeah.\n\nShri Mataji: She will be back now and she has got now a house given by the council.\n\nYogi: Yeah.\n\nShri Mataji: She should settle down there. So she says that I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to hell if I do not do Sahaja Yoga. She should do Sahaja Yoga, but not to come to [INDIST.]. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want others to suffer on account of her. Somebody has to tell Don that they should keep away from her and let her stay in her council-house. Say, Mother tells her. And she really play games about you. She makes the whole thing look so difficult. I mean she is a seeker, this is the worst part, to see the seeker. And has been a seeker for ages, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I love her so much. I went to a place to cure her and everything but this bhoot comes into her and she again wants to do the same thing. It\xe2\x80\x99 hard to save her, if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get rid of the bhoot, then \xe2\x80\xa6.\n\nHas you got the keys?\n\nYOGINI: No, not yet Mother, [INDIST.].\n\nShri Mataji: Hmm.\n\nYOGINI: Just you see mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Hmm.\n\nYogi: Is there an exercise that we can do for Vishuddhi?\n\nShri Mataji: Hmm?\n\nYogi: Is there an exercise that we can do for Vishuddhi?\n\nShri Mataji: Right side?\n\nYogi: No, Vishuddhi.\n\nShri Mataji: Which both?\n\nYogi: Well, both, yeah.\n\nShri Mataji: Just yesterday I told that, exercise is one of them is to raise your Kundalini up. And lying with your head, you put both the hands straight, as much as you can. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. No, not like that. Move it \xe2\x80\xa6 Hmm \xe2\x80\xa6 now go straight, straight, straight ... put both the hands here, hmm, there, and now do it, ha. See, they are not straight hands. Put them straight, ha. Now, now \xe2\x80\xa6 can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. It\xe2\x80\x99s better now!? Just put it straight. Better now. You are doing better. Now still it\xe2\x80\x99s [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: stout], hands are [INDIST.]. Hmm, now see \xe2\x80\xa6 see your vibration. It should be better.\n\nYogi: [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: I can\xe2\x80\x99t say].\n\nShri Mataji: Another one is to lock your hands behind, like this. Yes \xe2\x80\xa6 put it down \xe2\x80\xa6 head. It\xe2\x80\x99s good, it\xe2\x80\x99s very good, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Push your hand a, head back, Anna, in the center. You have thinned down, have you got liver?\n\nYOGINI: [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: Fasting for three days.]\n\nShri Mataji: Hmm. Get some sugar. You very much thinned down. What are you worried about? Ah? Do you worry about something?\n\nYOGINI: Not really.\n\nShri Mataji: Ah?\n\nYOGINI: Not really.\n\nShri Mataji: Your brother is better now? He too has the same Hippy-problem, is it?\n\nYOGINI: Yes. It\xe2\x80\x99s true.\n\nShri Mataji: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Now such an [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: intended] fellow, it\xe2\x80\x99s wasted. Now are you better now?\n\nYOGINI: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: Hmm? Ah, better? It\xe2\x80\x99s much better, the sun has also come up. You see? It has been nice enough for since I have been here. They are saying tomorrow it will rain, I said, [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: I can\xe2\x80\x99t see]. [Yogis laugh]\nHas he come?\n\nYOGINI: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: Hmm?\n\nYOGINI: Yes Mother, he has just come.\n\nShri Mataji: He has got the key?\n\nYOGINI: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: Just call him in one minute.\n\nYOGINI: Yes.\n\nYogi: Rajendra!\n\nShri Mataji: And now finish it off. [Yogis laugh] When the women do it, and it looks nice, beautiful and they know how to do it delicately. It is a job of the women. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the men here are not marrying, you know? They don\xe2\x80\x99t need the women any more. Look at the woman is there just to fix her breakfast, to do everything for her, make her tea, fix her breakfast, take her clothes for the laundry, I think iron it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. [Yoginis laugh] Next thing they will, they will be wearing a tie. [Yogis laugh] Going too much, I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s should not be that. The woman must be kept as a woman, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean she is dominated, in anywhere, that\xe2\x80\x99s her job.\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the job of a woman is [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: to do it] you should be proud. I mean, you are supposed to be house-proud women once upon a time, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know this word came from England only. House-proud. It\xe2\x80\x99s gone or what? Nowadays men are house-proud. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand cutting the grass outside men can do it. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand, why should they wash the utensils, they should never do that. Now what do they do women here, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what do they do? If they find anything untidy, now how can you bear it, for any woman? Right side, you see. She wants to see things [INDIST.] everywhere.\n\nActually these movements are make you really unisex, you can\xe2\x80\x99t make out man and a woman and there is no differentiation at all. The beauty is lost. It\xe2\x80\x99s minimum of minimum, these differentiation should be, there a man should be a man and a woman should be a woman, minimum of minimum. [Shri Mataji laughs] What is so difficult? And then the bhuts come on to a man of a woman and on a woman of a man and they get all these perversions.\n\nBetter now? [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: If he] was saying he may like to go. You are saying that parents have been very nice and they found a shop for you. All the lady-like things go away, horrible. And those rags and things within, just throw them away, really! And they are never washed! They are so dirty!\n\nYogi: Is this unisex they \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Ah?\n\nYogi: Is this unisex things/selling [??], Mother? Is that unisex thing, Mother?\n\nShri Mataji: Unisex?\n\nYogi: Hmm. This fashion is on the Kings-Road where they have all these shops, than this bus goes up Kings-Road, you see \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: You see, the shops I can don\xe2\x80\x99t blame for excessive demand, demand, then come out for everything, you see, if you say Ladies-Dresses for man, all right. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have that. [Yogis laugh, Shri Mataji too]\n\nAnything you want! You see, Shop-Keepers you can\xe2\x80\x99t blame, because all the shop-keepers are there because of the demand, you see, whatever demand is there -.\n\nH.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi'
