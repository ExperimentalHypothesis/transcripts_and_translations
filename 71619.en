Today I’m going to tell you the secrets of medicine. So far whatever we have known in the medical colleges or whatever we have known, there is something beyond it which we should know and utilize our knowledge for a great deal of advantage. Sahaja, Sahaja is with enjoy, he is born with you. With you he is born this right to become self-realized. Yoga is the union with the Divine Power. We have heard about Divine Power in all the books, scriptures, but we have never experienced it. We don’t know if it really existed or not. But the time has come for us to experience that. Also in the medical science we know quite a lot about sympathetic neurosystems. But we don’t know much about parasympathetic and its control. So the secret I’m going to tell you is how to control your parasympathetic effects. I will not tell you what is parasympathetic and how it works. But then it controls and it balances all the activity of the parasympathetic. If I say there is a power placed in our triangular bone which is called as x, you may doubt that. But this triangular bone is called sacrum, it’s a sacred bone, that means the Greek new about it, it’s a sacred bone. In this bone is placed in three and a half coils, that is also mathematical, three and a half coils, a power, which is made of milliplets. And which is the one, what we call, is for our ascent, for our last breakthrough. After human awareness, if we had achieved everything in our evolution, there would have been not all these problems. So many problems exist as we know, on individual level, on collective level, on every type of level. Why these problems should be there if we are really fully aware, involved? But we are not. There is something really has to be happened and for that our Creator Himself has placed this power in our triangular bone. Now you need not take My talk as granted, but you should experiment, as all experts do, you must experiment and see for yourself if there is this power or not, if it works or not, does it does not? No giving about it, it’s absolutely scientific, absolutely scientific. And once you enter into that arena of secret science, there will be a means that there is so much to be known about ourselves. Now all the scriptures have said that you should know yourself. For us it is some separate subject, not for doctors. It’s some sort of a religious subject that you should know ourselves. After all, we are a human being. Now of course we know that there is a doctor for one eye and a doctor for another eye, but this is we are going towards the unity. Unity as a human being, unity as all the movements, all the world, how do we do that? Is there any way of connecting you to that area of Divine power by which you all become like that? For example now, there’s a small little piece, doctor has fixed for me here and I am talking to you all. It never happened when I went to college, it was never so, but now it will happen. So the new future, uh, medical science has to understand what is parasympathetic, what is this Kundalini I am talking about, what is the function of this Kundalini, how it works. Now it is like a primule in a seed which sprouts, which sprouts and then it grows into a tree. Firstly, whatever is your seeking, if you have not known yourself, seeking is, may go on and is going on in this country as you know, like a mattress. All your seeking must come to an end, otherwise it has no meaning, waste of life, waste of energy. How can it be that it can be finished is a very, very simple thing. Within you lies this power, whatever may be your color, whatever may be your nationality, your religion, whatever, as long as you are a human being, this Kundalini is there, quite ready to be ascending. It ascends automatically, just like a seed has a view which ascends. You don’t do anything. You don’t have to stand on your head, nothing of the kind. It is there, so it also means spontaneous. It works out spontaneously. So, it is spontaneous. You all have this power within you and only thing you have to experience this. This rises, this power rises, passes through six centers, I think they have shown them here, and pierces through your fontanel bone area, which you know what it is, I need not tell you, and then pierces through and becomes one with this all-pervading power as this instrument is connected, you also get connected. Without connection this has no meaning. In the same way we do have no meaning, we are going here, there, there, there, there, but we are not yet knowing the truth and the truth is that you are all going to be the Spirit. Now here we come very close to spirituality and to the eternal. Not to be afraid of it. It is a part of the same relationship. It is a part of us. We can’t live without the grace of this Divine love or we can all-pervading power. Of course it is not mentioned in these and at least in any one of the books that you might have read, but it is a fact. You have to see for yourself. Don’t deny because it was not in your hopes or you have not learnt it from any point of view, but try to see for yourself if it is so. Because how beneficial it is. First of all, all these centers are responsible for your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. Now you see there is one psychologist, another is a doctor and they will do all that because we don’t know anything about psychology. I always tell you that your psychological, all these knowledge is like a child’s knowledge. Then the right side which is, I should say, is the knowledge of the body, of the body in the physical self and also the mental self is also not good. What you know is outside of your position. For that what you have to do is to first of all get your realization. That at least you should have. Nothing happens to you. There is nothing to be frightened about. There is nothing to doubt about. You all have to have your self-realization, that is the self-knowledge. Once you have your self-knowledge, you know all about your chakra, on your fingertips you can feel what’s the problem with you, what’s the problem of another person. For example somebody has cancer. Now he has to go through such a lot of rhythm and old, to dilute the whole thing. Sometimes people die during that time. But it’s only on your fingertips you can say what is the disease the person has. On the fingertips. Because you are entitled, you are empowered. But first raise your powers and become that and talking about becoming and nothing else. Unless and until you become that, you won’t understand what is the gift of the Divine to you. Once this Kundalini arises, she enlightens all the centers. She integrates all the centers. Apart from that she looks after all these centers. For example I will give you a piece of cancer. Now what we know about cancer is different doctors for different things and all that. But it’s very simple. Very simple. You have said, you have left side and right side of sympathetic nervous. Now I don’t know in the medicine how far they have gone but when I studied they thought both are just the same. They are not. They are two different systems. One works for the other but in a way it is opposite. So it’s complementary. I’ll show you now supposing in my hand I’ll show you. This is one center coming from the right side, another center from the left side and you put them together. Now this is the spinal cord system for you. Now when you work very hard you are working your right side very much, right side sympathetic very much and you are exhausting your energy in the center whatever it is. Suddenly your left side just breaks. Why? May be some shock, may be some accident, may be anything due to the sickness it breaks. Now it breaks means it has no connection with the center. That means it is on its own. That’s how many months it starts. Very simple as that. Now supposing by any chance, by any chance you could raise the Kundalini and push it through both these ends then it turns into a problem. That’s how cancer can be cured. Of course Sahaja Yoga has cured cancer. All kinds of cancers it has cured. But we don’t want to become doctors, you see. We don’t want to do doctor’s job, that’s your job. But we can tell you how you can cure so many people. The way I got this doctorate on paper I read about one chakra. So because in a short time I can’t tell you everything, it’s the Swahishtanta that shows you. In the second chakra I read. Chakra is the center, in the subtle center which talks out of your third center that you call as Nabhi chakra. And it starts moving like a lotus orgy. This is the one which looks after all the organs in the spina. This chakra is a subtle one. Of course you may not see the dissection but it is there. Now when it starts moving like this, what happens is that you get too much on one side. Suppose you are working very hard here, then it has to go too hard. If you are thinking too much, we never think how our brain is given energy, from where does it get energy. It is through this center our brain gets the energy. I mean the brain sense, the brain sense gets the energy from this center. Now this center is working very hard so it, and when it starts thinking too much, people who think, think, think, think, think, what happens to them is a simple transfer of energy we should say and this Swahishtana chakra becomes attentive only to the brain. It also looks out in your liver. It looks out in bacteria, it looks out in your spleen, it looks out in kidneys and also the artificial cells. I would say the whole of it is that. That’s the job it has to do, this poor one center. Now when you think too much, what first thing can happen to you if something goes wrong with your liver? Now the liver as a function as you know, is to take out all the heat of the body, heat of the body and deliver it into certain ratio of blood. Now that heat accumulates it cannot do it because liver is fading. As a result what happens, this heat starts moving upward. Now this is not in the medical news but I understand, starts moving upward. According to us there is a center, we call it right heart, the right heart, the very important center which we have left out right hand center of the heart, there are three arms. The right heart is connected and you can make Astha mind. Astha mind absolutely pure, 100% pure. No doubt but you have to take to Swahili, that’s all. Then this moves from here, the heat goes to the heart. Now when a boy is young, twenty-one year old, twenty-two years of age, is playing tennis and also drinking too much, then what happens that his liver goes out completely and maybe he gets such a massive heart attack that it is fatal, you cannot save that child. But this process goes on and sometimes people get massive heart attack later on. So this is the heat process which goes say from here and moves to the pancreas. You get out also this pancreas affected, you get diabetes. Diabetes is also in store of you to become a serving thing that you. Then it moves down to the kidneys and you get foundation to the kidneys and the kidneys stop. One general, then heat also as I told you goes to the spleen. If the heat goes to the spleen only then it’s what we call blood cancer. I shouldn’t say but we have cured many blood cancer patients and mostly architects and chartered accountants, all such people get this blood cancer. They are cured. For the last ten years they are living well, they are alright. But we don’t cure, we don’t want to cure. You have to cure, you have to die, that’s your job. I can only tell you what you have done. Then your intestines are affected and you become a super-paradigm. Very constipated person, always constipated. In the common human being, constipated. With this one center settling down with the Kundalini movement, all these problems can be solved. You won’t believe, see now, before this if I tell my grandmother that people are going to the moon, she will say, I have not first met her. How can I go to the moon? Now you know it is true. So it’s a very fast happening I should say. I call it the jet Kundalini in modern times. And it really works then, it’s surprising. Now this happening of one center is so important. There are so many diseases which can be cured if you can look after these centers. Except for two which I will say is one is this. Eats. Because they can be cured but they are extremely arrogant. And they think they are doing a martyrdom, they are martyrs. How can you talk to them? There are some big things like that, the silhouette of themselves. You cannot talk to them. Then another is the almighty. That’s another disease which you cannot attend to. Because this comes to people who have been just like killers in their lifetime. They are very aggressive. These people when they get this disease they become even worse. They may even abuse you, they may say everything, they can’t get up and hit you but they will say everything that is possible under this disease. So you give up your hopes about that and you say we don’t want to have all this abuse. Not that they cannot be cured I mean but it’s little too much. Sometimes it’s too much to attend to them. I tried on three people then I gave it up. Because when they started abusing me and all that I was surprised that they couldn’t receive any vibrations of it. So I said this cannot work out for them. So one has to be humble about it. If you think they have known everything it won’t be enough. One thing. Another thing you have to be extremely honest. You have to be honest. You have to be honest to yourself and honest to the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga. It’s all for you absolutely, the best that can happen. Now I was told that in this institution you have lot of research for you. I would love you people to do this research also. All of them. All the rest of the gimmicks people have done. All the best. It has not at all scientific in no way. For this you don’t have to do much research. Because you raise up to the linear of one person and you will see there is something. It’s a tremendous power within. But we don’t know our value. That’s what we said you should know your value. We don’t know what we have. What powers we have. What we can do. Not through book knowledge but through the knowledge of the Divine. So how when we come to that we understand that spirituality and good health, everything is to you. So as a result what do you get? On your fingertips you can feel the centers. Five, six and seven. Just like that is five, six and seven. The right thing. You can feel it. Where is the problem? There is no need to take them to the bar, sing them to a As we are not in this way we can’t do this. That’s the simple thing about it. And I wish as you have been so kind to be here, you learn what’s there. You don’t have to pay. There is no problem. Like so many people have suggested that and have written books that if the Kundalini rises then this problem comes and that. Nothing of the kind. Last thirty years I have been told, I have not seen one person anything how do you relate? Never, never. So it is for you just to see to it, spend at the most one month and you will be amazed, you will be masters, you will be masters. Because it’s your own power. It is not somebody else’s power. It’s your own power. It’s your own power. Only thing you should have the full knowledge, full knowledge about the secret science of medicine. Because only with this we have no thinking. Medicine is for theorists people and can do. Then this is the best, easiest way. But that doesn’t mean you discard. Because you are much more knowledgeable about it, you know what is the problem is. With the symptoms also you can say and you can verify. Very easily you can verify. Supposing you put your hands to something and you feel that person is a psychological place. You find out, you verify. And psychological places are completely pure in Sahaja Yoga. There is one patient who is here who was with you and only two years back I met him. And today he is a pure man. Psychology is very little pure, I must say doctor, I’m sorry. But they think very little pure. Also medically affected people also can be very little. First you must become the masters. You must have the whole powers within. And then you work it out and you will be amazed what powers you have. How much you can do to help this world. Apart from that the best thing that happens is a person gets completely calm from you. I feel, I have written also in my book, that in the genes we have a phosphorus. And if a person is dry, less water, this phosphorus explodes and you get into tempers. Getting into tempers is not your doing, it’s just phosphorus works down the neck. So how to get rid of it and how to cure it, it can go up to the point that it changes also your genes. It’s very surprising, that’s the most important thing that you can transform into. People become so beautiful, so collective, so compassionate, so loving, the life becomes so enriched with all this qualities and you enjoy your life with all of them. So you get your experience. Then you get your peace. How do you get your peace? There is the proof. That our style is to see anything we react. You must, I see this top, table I react, I see people I react. But with Kundalini rising it stops. How? Because a thought arises, falls down and a thought arises, falls down. It’s a continuous thing and we are mostly jumping on the cusps of these thoughts. Now when the Kundalini rises, she elongates this person. There is a space in between, it’s called in Sanskrit, the villain. We can call it pause and when your mind stops at that, you become thoughtlessly aware. You are thoughtless but you are extremely aware and you reach the witness state. You see everything as a witness, just as a witness. Say for example, I see a beautiful carpet. I am very very shy, enamoured and I react with, I say, Oh my God, what a good carpet, how much it must have cost, where can I get it and all that. Supposing it’s fine, then I am too worried, I have not yet registered it or issued it, so there is a promise. But supposing I am a realized soul, then I just watch it. I watch it silently and enjoy all the art that is put into it. That’s how you learn how to enjoy art. In Sahaja Yoga, all the people who were chartered accountants, never knew anything about music or poetry, have become poets, very great poets. Somebody who never used to sing has started singing, so many things have happened. Apart from that, anything, I must tell you this capital is the tree that you prosper. Because your awareness is so great that you prosper. All of them have prospered. All those Sahaja Yogis who have come to Sahaja Yoga have prospered. Not that you are hankering after money, but money hankers after you. You get prosper. And because your attention is so tight, your attention is so pure, in the light of the Spirit, your attention knows what is destructive for you, what is constructive for you. For example, somebody gets the money, he goes on wasting all this wisdom and getting all the bad qualities that are not needed for your body or for your mind. But supposing he is a realized soul, he gets the money, he says it’s possible for some good problems. And that’s how he works it out. So the prosperity comes and joy. Joy is singular, it is not happiness, it is happiness. Just if you feel joyous, you feel so joyous and happy and you don’t hurt anybody, that is not your job. You just enjoy your compassion, your love, your confidence. So this is what, when Meemee has produced this thing, for expression of her love, you have become a doctor. For her compassion, you have become a doctor. But now the ideology has changed. That’s what has to do with you. Enjoy it during the day. I mean I’m not taking anybody to these doctors, neither. They are trying anybody from the doctors, patients. But the enjoyment of the curing is so great, much greater than all the best people. And that’s how you get. But you don’t become poor. There are so many ways in your health because I said this Divine Power is also very important. Doctor’s thing, I can tell you, he, when he joined Sahaja Yoga and then he was in it, suddenly he got a very, very big job, very big job in India. How he got it and how he got it. And very happy. That’s how you understand how to have your beautiful family, how to have your beautiful relationships with each other, how to lead a very beautiful life and make a beautiful country. Such people are needed today. Such happy, joyous, peaceful and loving people we need. And that you get, for that you don’t have to suffer in any way. Don’t have to suffer. You enjoy. For curing others you don’t suffer. You really enjoy every thing. So I wish you all the best of God. Please. If you can, if you want to have self-realization, we’ll work it out. But that’s not the end of it. You have to attend our centers. No money in it. You can’t pay any money. This is one thing you should know. I mean in this country you could try to accept me because I was not giving any money. Can you believe that? They say, there are no rose-fries, I know. I only work on my uncle and I have nothing. Then you are in the business, no, I’m not. Then we don’t want it. This attitude has been changed. What will they all fall for? For joy, for happiness, for being good to others. And automatically your heart starts melting and really will be no longer different. Other problems also get solved. You see, there’s too much of right side because I’m saying, because you have dropped it. You people all develop right side more than the left side. Another thing which is very dangerous, one can get into, is the same heel going into your head. So you can get palampegia, you can get balance. It’s common. It’s very, very common. But that’s not necessary. I even have very old, much older than all of them. But one thing is there that I’m very active and I never feel tired, never feel tired. It’s so enjoyable, the whole thing is, to talk to people about issues and things and some kind of issues. Moreover, it cannot be forced on you. It cannot. You have to ask, why? Because this Kundalini is the pure desire. You know one thing, that our desires are not pure. If they were pure, there would have been no economics. Because you want to have one thing, all right, you get it, then you want to have another thing, you get it, you get it. You are never satisfied. So when this pure desire is said, you get the satisfaction. And that is not there and you enjoy each and everything, each and everything. That’s the temperamental duty. Beautiful. Human beings are very beautiful. I think they are little bit lost in the wilderness. And they have to come back to understanding of the truth. Because you get the Absolute Truth, Absolute Truth. If any person comes to Me, and I say, he has been saved, you can verify the Absolute Truth. Anyone who comes, say, from India and tries to cheat, when the guru goes on, you can easily find out if it’s true or not. Any other thing, whatever you want to know, it is absolutely knowledge that you can get. We call it as Gyanamaya, Mr. Power of knowledge and the power of absolute knowledge. On your nervous system, it’s very, very dynamic, but you are dynamic. It’s still, it’s still being put away. But let it rise and you will see how dynamic you are, how much you are effective, how much you can go to retirement. Thank you very much. I made it. And I would request people to understand that I cannot force you. It has to be of your desire and soul. I would say, if you don’t want to have your Self-realization, then go away. But nothing happens, hardly takes ten minutes for you to reach the heavens. So why not try? There will be no questions, I think. I wonder if you could be specific about what one would expect to see. Does one sit in that position? Does one say a mantra? Does one do physical movement? Does one close one’s eyes? I have no idea what I’m talking about. That I will tell you, infinitely. But you don’t have to stand here and ask, nothing of the kind. You can’t. It’s very simple. Wherever you have to go, it’s all right. Thank you for asking. Motherji, what would be the effect of diet and posture on meditation? Ahara sahaja yoga, ahara sahaja yoga, ahara sahaja yoga, ahara sahaja yoga. This you can find out. Once you have your realization, you will realize what sort of a personality you are and what sort of food you should have. You see, it is not before that you can just say, all right, you become this, you become that. Once you get your realization, you yourself will realize that what kind of food you should take, what kind of posture you should have. It means that Motherji, certain schools say that the kind of diet that you take, for example fruits and like natural foods which women are agreed in getting, like in meditating properly, there are certain things like say, meat or for that matter or wine, all these do not work properly. That’s why you are saying that you are not like that. It’s not like that. It’s not like that. It’s a very analytical because say for example, I would say in general in India people should eat meat because they are so big, their muscles are so big. But say in the European countries they should eat less meat because they are quite muscular, I think they are sometimes. For a liver patient, there is balance of the kind. It depends on the personality. Thank you. First I was saying in Marathi and then I was saying in English. I was saying in Marathi and then I was saying in English. My son is autistic and he has a very low mental IQ. So how can I treat him? How can I explain him? How can he do the yoga? How can I explain him? He is a very good person. He is a very good person. He is a very good person. He is a very good person. He can be cured. He can be cured. He can be cured. He can be cured. He can be cured. Where is your meditation class and how can we get there? You have to come and you will be seized. You can try and you don’t have to pay. You bring that son there of Charu Charu and you see for yourself. I am just telling her, she is talking about somebody who is 29 years of age and he can’t even say it. So I said, all right, you get your realization. You understand and you can cure it. Also these people can go and do it. Not that people will not. But she can do it herself. We have no hospital here, nothing. Actually I wanted one of these doctors to come and stay here and tell you about Sahaja Yoga. Who has the means of Adam and Eve, so no problem. But if somebody could be employed or something, he could come here. That was my suggestion. Thank you. I have a question. Dr. Dallai, you do funny ones, don’t you think? Yes? Dr. Dallai, you do funny questions, don’t you? Well, it depends on your son. Anyway, this is also your yoga. So you are dealing with the Kundalini aspect of the yoga. India is everywhere. It’s not here, don’t say. I’m just saying or not. Okay, my first question is, you are dealing with the Kundalini yoga. That aspect, can we find any one person, any who can join also my experience with you? Yes, all right. That’s the point for that. You have to come to our center. We have got, I have a human to find us, not only 50 for books I think. And also we have written about medicine, you can come and get it, they will help you. But you have to come there. Yes, I will come there but is there some flyer? You can come to know where are the yoga centers you have here in Maryland. So, can you not see from here? That information will convey to you shortly. Let me do that. Thank you very much. You are so anxious, I’m very happy. But they will do all that and tell you where is the thing. Now, most of them are anxious to get their Self-realization. So you get your Self-realization and then you go to the center also. All right? Thank you. May I make a quick comment? I’m sorry, I just wanted to let you make a comment. May I make a quick comment? I’m just trying to tell you that I have, I myself have worked with the eight patients that you mentioned and they want to come back to the meetings and they do the same meditation themselves. They have been treating themselves. Okay? Like this. Bending and bending. All these things you can ask is the letter. Why don’t ask there? Why people are waiting to get their Self-realization, isn’t it? So just respect that. You have to respect them, respect ourselves also. Is that what I’m saying? I think, by the time they are fully available, they are coming to me. It’s common. I’m not sure. All right. Now everybody must sit down. That’s important. You should be relaxed. You all should be relaxed. Now one half of you have to ask is to take out your shoes because it’s not an earth itself but we eat them. I hope you don’t mind. Okay. There’s no need to sit on the ground or anything. Be gentle in your curiosity, okay? That’s the problem. All right. Please put both your hands towards Me. Just like this. Simple like this. If they are on your lap, also all right. You shall make a good feeling out of it. Now, as a very outside, I have to ask you one thing. That you should not feel guilty at all for anything. I’m catching this figure. That means there are people who are feeling guilty. See, whatever has happened in the past is past. It’s finished. And the future doesn’t exist. You have to be in the present. And so please don’t feel guilty. If something has been done wrong, all right, so what? At this moment, at least you should not be guilty. It’s a wrong thing to feel guilty and kill yourself. That has happened. I don’t know why, in the West they have done nothing. Nothing wrong. If they were guilty, they would have been in jail. It’s a common fashion to feel guilty also. Indians will never feel guilty, somehow. They don’t know how to fight for his feeling. And then another theory is that you have to forgive others. Forgive others. You may say that Mother, it’s very difficult to forgive others. You may say that. But what I would say logically, whether you are forgiving or not forgiving, you are doing nothing. What are you doing? By not forgiving, only you torture yourself. So forgive. Forgive everyone and forgive yourself. That’s a very important thing and it has such a tremendous power. So I request you to forgive yourself and forgive others. That’s all. That’s all you can do. You’ll work out, I’m sure. You’ll work out. Now how do you forgive? Just to say, Mother, I forgive everyone. That’s all. Mother, I forgive myself. Mother, I forgive everyone. You can say that’s very simple to say. That’s not a mantra or anything but it’s a very big thing because it opens the center here which is on the crossing of the optic chalice, which is very constricted and it opens. Like that. So just say that because you could really need has to rise. That’s the main thing. Now please put your right hand towards Me and put down your head and see for yourself there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Just see. Cool or hot breeze coming out of the fontanel bone area. Just see for yourself. You can put your hand up there or on the sides or forward, backward, forward, backward, anywhere you feel like and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze or hot breeze like vibrations coming out. It is hot because you have not forgiven yourself or you have not forgiven others. This must be the reason but let feel that it’s coming out of your head is the biggest proof. Now don’t doubt it. There’s no air conditioning in your head that it is coming out. We must not doubt it. So lay it little bit. Lay it little bit. Not in front. Take it on the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in our childhood. Now please now put the left hand towards Me and bend your head and see with the right hand now, see for yourself there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Have faith in yourself. That’s the main thing. You all can get realization and you can become all self-realized also. Just like saying Sufis. Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand again on the fontanel bone area. You can move your hand and see for yourself if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Now after this please put both your hands towards Me and bend your head. And don’t think. Just don’t think. Don’t think. Just don’t think. Have your hands fully open like this and don’t think. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on the fingertips or on the palm or on top of your head, out of the fontanel bone area, please raise your hands. Oh My God! Thank you very much. So many of you, wow! Now only I have a very humble request is that you must attend to myself. Please attend to ourselves. I am trying to master this out. You can. This power is delivering you heat. It’s coming out of your fontanel bone area. And it is there. It’s so great and worth it no matter. So I would request you to please go to our center and mark me.
