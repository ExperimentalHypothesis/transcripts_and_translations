Talk in Marathi at a Sahaja Yoga seminar in Kalwe, Maharashtra (India). 19 January 1979.

To come from London to Mumbai, it feels very relaxing – because there is a lot of hustle and bustle in that city. It is very mechanical. And in general, the mentality of the people out there has also become the same. So then, to come from Mumbai to Kalwe feels even better. Because seeing the state of mind and devotion of the people in city, I feel like going to a place where I can meet a few having true devotion. Our Sahaja - it is going to spread and work out through the villages. It won’t happen through the cities. I have said it before and we have been experiencing it as well. Now, since you are all so close to the city(Mumbai), you do have a little bit of the city air in you. But even then, people living close to nature always feel the existence of God. Does God exist or not? All that, what we have been reading about it till today – is all that true? Or is it just something that had been written down to keep people in illusion. This is the time to verify if all that is true and assure yourselves with the experience - Because we keep coming across a lot of jokers in the name of God. If you go to the temple, you have to give money.  You feel the need to do it every time you go there. If a rich person visits a temple, he will put on the priciest garland to the idol. And if, on top of that, he comes in a big car then he is regarded even closer to god. But God is someone who is hungry for emotions. He doesn’t understand money and the worldly riches. He understands the richness in faith. And it is only the faith which can recognize the divine. Now, faith does not mean blind faith. Say some person rubs dirt on his body and comes saying that he is a big guru – that makes heads turn towards him. And people fall at his feet - like coconuts which are smashed at the feet of idols in temples. The people of our country are very emotional and innocent. But they should be innocent in ‘Dharma’, just being innocent is not sufficient. Innocent in Dharma means that you should recognize the Dharma. First of all, you should get that discretion – to know, whom to bow down your head before, who is the real guru and who isn’t. Every person walking down the road cannot be a guru. Perhaps, he maybe someone of a category even lower than that of us. That person, who lives off of someone else’s money, can never be a guru. Even if you people might earn a little, you are standing on your own feet. You too have that feeling within yourselves – that you don’t want depend on anyone else for your livelihood. So when these fake people stay alive off of your money in such ways, you should realize that they are not real but someone of a very low category. They take money from you and live off of you. So if they try to cheat you by saying that they are such and such or they have done such and such great things, you should be able to recognize that this person can never be dharmic. The other thing is - it has been said about dharmic or sanyasi people (people who have renounced all worldly activities), that he should not be allowed to stay in villages. Only people wanting to lead a family life can stay in villages. Sita has said in Ramayana, that no sanyasi should be allowed to stay in a village. If he has to pass a village and take a halt, he can do so but only outside the boundaries of that village. If a person gets in touch with a village then how can he call himself a sanyasi? Ravana had disguised himself as a Sanyasi and had cheated Sita. She remembers that incident and warns us against such people in Ramayana. That these people who wear such saffron clothes and stand in front of you, they have actually come to steal from you. Actually if you think about it, what is the need to wear such clothes? – He, who is detached from within, isn’t running after anything. He, who is a king within - why would he need such gimmicks to impress others? There is inherent in human beings, a feeling that there exists a higher power. Especially the people living in rural areas, they always have a feeling that there is an existence of someone like god out there. They are so used to the ways of nature, every day they get to interact with it directly. They feel so dependent on it – if it rains, only then would they be able to do agriculture. If the land is not fertile enough, they take it as a sign that mother earth is offended with them. If there is a fire somewhere, they feel as if the god of fire or some goddess has been offended. If the village is affected by some disease, they feel that it is due to their fault – that they have done some wrongs to incur the wrath of gods. In such situations, human beings starts believing in nature. And the nature itself is God – with this belief he starts worshipping the divine. You can experience the existence of god – but you cannot create god himself. The god exists as he is. If you say that you can change his ways of working or you can change him to be a certain way – that is not possible. The only thing you can do is - you can meditate upon him and you can recognize him when he comes and shows himself to you. However, this wisdom should come to you - that depth should come inside you, you should be able to feel him. So what should we do about it? What needs to be done? If I need to see you, I need to open my eyes. It is through them that I have to see who you are, where you come from. I need to ask you questions like where you live, what is the name of your village. That’s how I come to know – through these eyes. If my eyes themselves weren’t open in the first place, I wouldn’t have been able to come to know you. Likewise to know God we have a different set of eyes within us – it is called the ‘Atma’.  Until the eyes of this atma don’t open up, we cannot see god or recognize him. Until the Atma gets awakened within us, until we can see its flame -till then what we believe to know is god, there is always an element of untruth attached to it. Or it can be said that you cannot fully get the knowledge about him - You can still learn a little. Like, if someone is partly blind, he can still see a bit. So unless with get the eyes of our atma, until those eyes open completely – we cannot recognize god. We feel that if put up an idol at the altar in our house and keep worshipping it, we have a connection with him. But do we check on our behavior afterwards? Even if we fight amongst ourselves, kill one another – we still believe that God is on our side. Why? Because he is at our altar. And if we go back and offer him something again, he will continue to be pleased with us. So then no one feels bad about the fact that they have lied, robbed, fought, brought ill upon others. All those bad deeds have happened through their hands, a thought like that doesn’t even cross their minds – because we established an god at our altar, haven’t we? Then that’s it – We will perform an ‘arti’ to the idols and everything will be taken care of. We need not worry about what comes next. The idol doesn’t stand up and starts hitting back - so we like such a ‘convenient’ God. But, it never does us any ‘convenience’. It doesn’t do our ‘self’ any good. Only, if at all, it would help us exist in this outwardly world – to some extent. But then, even that peril comes up and stands in front of us eventually. Now, when the human starts suffering from some disease, he remembers god. He doesn’t think of him as much in times of happiness. But when he is struck by some calamity he starts feeling that he has done something wrong- “how did I get this disease, I must have done something to displease god”. Same is the case when it is some emotional/psychosomatic problem, heart problem – you start thinking – “what happened mother, what did I do wrong, why did we get this disease?” Actually, you haven’t really committed the wrongs knowingly. But you still harbor the blindness. Because till your atma is awakened you are still blind. What knowledge do you have about god or dharma? All that you know about it is all half-baked. So, there needs to be a provision in place that would help us experience our atma. Who will put such a mechanism in place? Can we do it? Have we created these eyes through which we can see the world? Who has given them to us? God, hasn’t he? This nose, this mouth, this body – all of it is provided by the almighty. Have you achieved any of that? What have you done to become a human? You evolved into a humans from animals – how did that happen? What is it that you did to make that happen? So the eyes that are needed - to see the divine, to come to know the atma – those eyes will have to be provided by the divine, isn’t so? What can we do about it? It is not going to happen by jumping up and down from morning till evening, neither are you going to achieve it by doing pujas or artis or by reciting the name of god a million times a day. The arti has some meaning only after you come to know that god. But if you just can’t see then how are you going to benefit from it? How will you know if it’s a god, or a stone, or a rock? So to begin with you should first be able to come to know your atma. And until you realize - that without knowing your atma nothing is going to work out - you are not going to like what I am saying. So how do you open this atma? “How do we do it, mother?” - This is a question of the majority. I have already said before that you cannot do anything about it. It the doing of the divine – he has given us this being, he is the one who is going to provide us with those eyes. He is the one who going to meet us up with our atma. And he does do it. But the time for it needs to come. If tomorrow, a flower starts worrying whether it is going to turn into a fruit - like “how will it happen, when will it happen” – what is the point in worrying? When the time comes, it will become the fruit automatically – without the flower doing anything about it. So likewise, you will get to meet your atma when your time comes. And it is going to happen for sure, it is already happening - properly and on time.  Thousands have got their realization. That is, they have come to see their atma - their atma started speaking through them. Without experiencing your atma or getting your realization as they call it, you won’t even be able to talk to god. Morning till evening, we keep reciting the name of Lord Rama – but where is Rama? Is it everyone’s right to take his name? Are you entitled to call out his name - every one of you? Now if we say that we take our prime minister’s name – what is the point? Is he going to come running to you? Is he your servant? - So, is god your servant that you keep calling out his name? There needs to be some connection between him and you first. You have to inquire first, request his introduction – make a connection. Likewise, when you want to meet him, you first need to get his permission – just like in the case with the prime minister. If you don’t establish your connection with god, if you don’t get his permission – yet you still go and shout out his name at his door step – won’t his guards catch hold of you and ask why you are troubling him. What right you have got to come to his place? So, first get your connection with your atma, get to meet it. And you will feel it for yourselves, the power of the divine starting to flow through your hands. Then you ask that power – does god exist? You will be surprised that when you ask such a big question, that power will flow though you with such great force and will shout out to you that the answer is yes. Any questions like such, and this power will give you the answer. And then you realize that this power is present everywhere, that what they say is true – that not even a leaf moves without the will of god. Because it is only after you realize your atma that you get to realize this great power. You see her, you feel her. It is only then – after you feel her flowing through you – that you can give her full momentum. When this power starts flowing through you, you will be surprised – your mental state and your physical state becomes perfectly alright. Very few people need to visit doctors after they get their realization. Everyone becomes healthy. If mental issues exist, they too go away. Not only that, but the financial state of the household also becomes better. Everything has to get better from every angle. Now say, if I have to visit Mr. Patil’s house tomorrow - he will clean everything up and decorate the house in my welcome, right? Likewise, if god decides to enter into you - your mind, your body, your thoughts, all of it will be cleansed out. It is only after all those things become clean, can god enter. And this is the reason why the illnesses of so many people have got cured. We have cured many great diseases, and we continue to do it. But it is not that we cure only diseases. If you get your realization, if the light of atma spreads through you, then gradually all that darkness – let it be the darkness in your mind, health, your dharma, any kind of darkness -  it will jolly well have to go away, automatically. You will ask – how? Now once this bulb here has been switched on – how did the darkness vanish, that which was present here before? The same thing happens to you too, and the human becomes a better being from every aspect. Not only that but he becomes eligible to enter the realm of collective consciousness - The word seems difficult to understand but actually it is pretty straightforward. There exists a power which is flowing through all of us, it exists within every one of us. Once you come to know that power, you realize that all of you are one – this realization starts flowing through you. You come to know where such and such person lives, what problems he has - all through your hands. Same about your problems as well, you come to know what is wrong with you too. You get all these powers. You needn’t have a lot of intelligence to acquire them, you don’t need any money. You are a human being, not an animal – that is all what is required. On the contrary people who have a lot of wealth, are extremely intelligent, they hardly get their realization. So, it the people in the middle- with average intelligence – who are apt for this. Now, it also won’t work out with people who are extremely poor, who don’t even have sufficient food to eat – because day and night they will be worried about how to get money, they will thinking about stealing just to feed themselves. And that’s alright, you can’t expect anything more from them – because that is their state. But once the average people get their realizations, the whole of society (including the impoverished) progresses and everyone benefits from it. Because Laxmi(the goddess of wealth) also bestows her blessings upon you. Now everyone is worried about how their condition will improve, how will their financial state get better, or other question that they have – how will those get solved, how are we to find answers to all those questions. To answer that – there is a center for Sahaja in your locality. Wherever there is a center, there resides god. If you come to the center, your problems will be solved. It is not going to work out by sitting at home. A lot of yogis think that – now we have got our realization so all our questions should get solved without going anywhere. The clinic to get answers to your question is the center. If you come to the center every week (or whenever there is a program), and if you surrender that question out there – then all questions and problems get effortlessly solved, once you come to know your atma. I will give you an easy example. You will be surprised, but it happens all the time. And there are countless such examples like this - And you won’t be able to deny these miracles, saying that it could have been a coincidence. We were in London, there was this muslim boy from Algeria. He came and told me that he has been trying to get a scholarship since 6 months. And now he has run out of time and would have to go back to Algeria. He had got his realization. I asked him when he was leaving for his country. He said this Thursday. So I asked him why not Tuesday. So he agreed to leave on Tuesday instead. On Monday he went to his college. The list for students receiving scholarship was put up – His was the first name on it. So, this is one example. Likewise there are many such. If you ask your fellow yogis in Mumbai, they will enumerate examples that will fill up books after books. I told just one of them – likewise all of your questions get solved, effortlessly. But to get those solved you need to visit the center - that is true. God is going to be present at the place where people get together to worship him. If you say – “No mother, you need to come to my home. Whatever it is please do it over there” – which is ‘your’ home? If you keep sticking to you ‘my’ness, god will never listen to you. You are in the collective conscious now. God is only going to get where all of you get together to call him. He is not just for you alone. Some people even come and order me- “Mother I ‘have’ to get a job, my children ‘should’ complete all their education”. Then, “my daughter ‘should’ get married”. Then, “my house ‘should’ get constructed”. This ‘should’ happen, that ‘should’ happen. Why? Because I ‘have’ come to see you. Like, there is this shop that has been opened up by god where you come expecting god to take your money and fulfil your wishes. We ask as if we are buying something. You shouldn’t ask that ways. Instead, you should say – All that is with me, all of it is laid out in front of you. So you only look after to it. It is only you that we want. Once we achieve you, we won’t need anything else. Once you say this, all the questions will be solved. None of those questions poses a challenge to god. He just needs to twirl his pinky (smallest finger) and the work is done. They say that god does everything. A lot of people come and tell me that they went on pilgrimages and asked god to do something. But he never listened to them, he didn’t fulfil their wishes. But that is not the case now. You hadn’t got your realization before. So you didn’t have the permission to go there, to ask anything from him. Now that you have met your atma, see for yourself how many powers you have. First recognize yourself, and you will be surprised – whatever you say will be done. Because now you are in the kingdom of god. Folks like Ganesha, Hanuman and Bhairava are standing behind you. And they are all fully competent to get your work done. But this is not like some guru is giving you a sermon and you are believing him without getting the experience. I am not giving you a sermon but trying to get you to experience that divine power. The people in villages are simple and straightforward. And they don’t even have much money. Maybe that is the reason they understand God better. They can recognize him as well. A villager can easily make out who is a genuine person – it is not so easy for a city dweller.  So, mostly, all the big and bad fake gurus establish themselves in the city. They won’t be able to run their businesses in villages. And they don’t even want to. Because they can’t make money out here. They don’t want any love. If at all a few of them are not able to make money in the cities, then they come wandering back to the villages because they don’t an option left anymore. So you see, there are lots of expectations from you all. The almighty has brought you all to place which is so rich with nature - there must be many reason to it. And the main one is that if you realize who god is then you all will be able to imbibe it within yourself extremely well. The city dweller won’t be able to do the same as well as you would. Because you haven’t learned how to con and hustle like the city people have. All that dirt still hasn’t entered into you. Extremely filthy things are going on in the cities and the people out there have taken to them. The state of their mind is such that – if I try to sow any seed in it, it pains me a lot. To tell you, if someone asks me to work out Sahaja in London I feel very dull. And I feel very tired. To look at, the people out there are all well-dressed, fair and good looking. But there is so much dirt on the inside, that I don’t even feel like putting in the effort to work it out in them. Instead if someone asks me to come to Kalwe and work, I’ll be fully ready – if you make me a small hut over here to stay, I’m all ready to come here and work. I’ll enjoy it. But it is not so in London, because the people out there are too dirty. And their state is so dirty that you can’t even have them standing at your doorstep. But what to do – as fate would have it, my husband got posted out there and I had to go along. And the opportunity to better the life of the people out there came to me and so I am doing that as well. And many English people have got their realization too. But none of them are even close to the dust of your feet. Their devotion cannot be compared with yours. And they are completely lacking your innocence. So there is nothing to learn from them. You might think that they have nicer clothes and big fancy cars, and so they are living in luxury and comfort, but that is not the reality at all. They are actually very sad. One out of every ten commits suicide. And out of ten, seven have failed marriages. Such is the situation out there. So, in such a country, to imagine that any dharma could exist doesn’t seem possible. Two children are killed by their parents out there every week. Good children. The mother kills them, herself, by strangling them. Every week. Have you heard of anything like this? A mother, from here, would give her life for her child. So you see, you have such beastly people out there – extremely animal-like who have turned completely mechanical, they have no feelings. You should never try to become like them. The importance that love has in our culture - this property, this wealth, this rich heritage of our country – we need to cherish it. We need safeguard it. Because, the power of the almighty is that of love. And he is hungry for love – so you should have love in your attention, you should always stay in love. And you should only enjoy love. Over here, Mr. Patil has started this beautiful thing (sahaja center at Kalwe?) and slowly the vibrations have become very good. I felt that today.  I felt very happy when I came here today. To be honest, I went into meditation when I came at the doorstep and felt that this place is going to turn out to be a very great venue for the work of the divine. Not only that but I started feeling that this place would someday become a pilgrimage spot. Such are the vibrations that I have felt here. Now I have come here many times before but this time around I felt tremendous joy - and all my blessings are on this Kalwe and on all of you. By the grace of god, one day, this place is going to become very renowned. And all your children will be blessed with their well-being in their ‘dharmic‘ life. If that day comes while I am present on this earth, it would be very nice. I hope it happens in my lifetime.

My blessings to you all.

If you have question, do ask.  (Question inaudible) .. That, you need to see within yourself. Close your eyes and feel. If your eyelids are fluttering while your eyes are closed then you have to open your eyes. But if they don’t then close your eyes. And you will be surprised – if you see within yourself, you will realize that no thought comes to you. You feel completely silent inside. Close your eyes and see if you are getting any thoughts. Because when the energy rises and crosses the agnya, all your thoughts stop. You get into thoughtless awareness. Some people might be feeling something cool coming out of their hands, like a cool breeze. Those who are experiencing that have got their realization.
