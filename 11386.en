Advice To Women, Shri Vishnu 1982-09-27

Shri Mataji: A real Lakshmi. 
Sahaja Yogini: Hum. 
Shri Mataji: Innocence, just see the innocence of this, it has such innocence. 
Sahaja Yogini: This is in Portugal Mother, just before the- 
Shri Mataji: Ah, this is a sanyasi, really, I tell you. Now the camera is taking the freshness, it is remarkable. 
I must say the camera is great. 
Sahaja Yogi: I guess the English have a good camera [Inaudible] [Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Or the cameraman. 
Sahaja Yogi: The film was good. 
Shri Mataji: Or you can say the film was good, alright. It’s alright up to that point.
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible] It’s the actor who was great. 
[Shri Mataji ii laughing.]

Shri Mataji: Now this is in the West. 
Sahaja Yogi: Mayork
Shri Mataji: Now, the people, the women are intelligent- and the women of the West being intelligent and educated, have developed a kind of a very complex situation about themselves. Sahaja Yogi: They also can earn money Mother. 
Shri Mataji: Yes, and also they’re handling their own money. 
These things have made them, you see, a kind of a man without the manliness. And that’s why their whole behaviour becomes extremely odd, sometimes I just don’t understand. 
But now I’ve started understanding; it’s the way they are women, they want to dominate men. But they don’t understand by dominating, you cannot create good relationship. 
Now, to dominate men, one way could be just to go on, just behaving like a man, you see, pushing you through and all that, saying: "Don’t do this, I don’t like this, it’s not good, that is not good". But that’s not so sophisticated. So the other way is to all the time, talk about your miseries, you see, of your past, "I’m like this, this is wrong with me " all the time she’s sick, all the time she’s miserable, all the time she’s insecure. All the time, she’s oh, this thing she needs her husband, she wants the attention of the husband, her husband must look after her. Ultimately, I think, the husband must be getting fed up and running away from the wives and must- that’s why the prostitution is so strong; cause at least, prostitutes try to please the husband and not to [inaudible] because she has to earn her living, you see.

And I think it’s just the other way round in India. The men will ?, the man will say: "This is not good. " The men will say: "We are sick and you must look after me" and all that. They don’t say that: "We have to look after you." They say that: "You have to look after us".   And the women think that because they are their wives, they are the shaktis, so they have to bear it upon themselves and give them the joy. 

Now the women here have another very bad capacity, I’ve seen that, in Sahaja Yoga, I’ve seen it, that they always say that the negativity attack, all the time, for any reason, nights and days. Like just now, somebody told me that when you have a child, you feel more attacked by negativity because you are left out alone. Imagine! When you have a child you have such a great company of a child! I mean for an Indian mother, as soon as she’s pregnant, she feels the happiness of the child. Then the child is born, she feels the company of the child. I mean for her nothing more is needed than that her own child is there. And then, through her child she learns how to love other children.  
But even when the children are born they put the same nonsense, you know, on the children. "Oh how bad is the husband, he’s done so much to me and how bad is this world, how bad was my mother doing this to me". And this is how they try to dominate the child and make that child absolutely miserable. That’s how we call them "Les misérables", from where it has come the source of this thing? [unsure]. 
Now if they are uneducated they are even worse, because they have a complex. If they are less intelligent, other problem. They try to play all dirty tricks with the husband, with other people. If the husband has any relationship with anyone, they don’t like it, it’s most of the time that they don’t like it, like friendship. If the husband wants to talk to other me, not women, of course, women you can have objections, but I can’t understand if has friends, they don’t like the friends of the husband to come in their house. The other way round in India. The husband’s friends are very much welcomed, looked after by the wife, there’s a sweet relationship between them and they call then the sister in law and it’s very sweet, you see. 

But here, it’s just the other way round.  They just abhor all the relations of the husband. And this is something most surprising that husband is not [inaudible] all these relations are’ part and parcel of him and he is sort of obliged to them or related to them or he’s attached to them. And if she really loves the husband, then she should accept all the relationship also.
