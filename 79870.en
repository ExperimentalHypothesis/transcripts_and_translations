PART 2 (uncompleted) Diner time. 

Warren: I see take the whole floor out and just put a little loft in, like this.
Shri Mataji: The loft, then what’s here? There is also higher loft. So, the height over that is about say 16 feet.
Warren: Oh! At least, Mother.
Shri Mataji: At least.
Sahaja Yogi/Warren: More because actually, your bedroom is about 13 or 14 feet. Actually, without that full ceiling. Then on top of that, there'll be another 9 feet. So, it be 30 it be 25, 20, 23.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, to reach the height, you can’t.
Sahaja Yogi: It will be more or less like this.
Warren: More or less like this. If it was done, it would be more or less, your bedroom would be a little higher than this. Perhaps.
Shri Mataji: I’s already about 8, 9 feet high.
Warren: Yes. There’ll be another foot on this, then the actual projection upwards would be like this. If I can just-
Shri Mataji: No, that’ll be much more, you see, about 8 feet of the height of the roof, plus the top.
Sahaja Yogi: Not 8 feet, Mother. It's about 7 foot the height to the existing ceilings, then on top of that, there's only about 7 feet.
Shri Mataji: So, about 14 feet or plus.
Warren: 14 and 25, 26 feet yes.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, what we can do by changing these [unclear] in my bedroom, a little higher [unclear]

Arnaud: Shri Mataji, one thing interesting about the Japanese people, when you mentioned the Japanese, today, they are just controlling all the financial world and they're just having the Americans on the neck it's absolutely unthinkable.
Sahaja Yogi: That's why this dollar is going down, Mother. England and America are sort of balancing together but Japan's up here. And Germany's up here and Switzerland is not far behind them.
Shri Mataji: Japan is going to be killed by its own inflation. It will be killed by its own inflation; you just don’t worry. You see, in their own country, the currency- to buy, say, what we buy in England for 1 pound, they have to spend 10 pounds, in their own country.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, that’s true.
Shri Mataji: It’ s like, you see. They say there are bricks of gold [Hindi]. In Lanka, there is the gold brick. Because, you see, like the exchange was done with not with rupees, but with gold bricks. One fellow thought he’ll go and earn a lot of money he went down there. And he made in one day, five bricks of gold. He said, "Why you go there? I am going to be rich now ". So next day, he went for his haircut and he had to pay one brick, finished! By the evening, all the bricks were spent out. And he loaned one to someone.
So, in international relationship maybe. But inflation in that country is so high now. If you want to buy a Japanese [unclear] set in Japan, it is 10 times more than in America.
Sahaja Yogi: They have no competition in Japan.
Shri Mataji: It is. Food is so expensive. My nephew was there, food is so expensive, that education so very expensive.
Sahaja Yogi: And housing also Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Housing is so expensive. I mean, it is a horrid place to live in. He could not save a single pai, he resigned now. He resigned from Shipping Corporation, just resign and came back. He just could not manage [unclear]. And he had at least 10 times more paid there.
Just like here. Rustom is telling me that on the average the salary of a person is 6,000 rupees. Our prime minister in India gets 5,000 rupees.
Sahaja Yogi: As a pilot in the Army, he has 6,000. But there are poor people Shri Mataji today. Shri Mataji: And they are poor people.
Sahaja Yogi: They don't have cloth.
Shri Mataji: You see.
Sahaja Yogi: They don't. To buy a single to top, Shri Mataji, for you, it cost them 300 rupees. Sahaja Yogi: It's all relative.
Arnaud: Is it the same here?
Gregoire: So, it is the same here. This artificial wealth is hiding the fact that it's all rubbish.
Shri Mataji: Russians are the wisest of the whole of you, I must say. They are the best.
They have the best of everything and they have got everything that is natural with them. They have gone to the third world, with all natural things to themselves. And they really having a nice time.

They have all beautiful carpets from India, beautiful embroided things, everything is nice. If to their houses, you never think they [unclear]. All the good wood work is with them. Everything they have got. They have exported, you see, all they have accepted because what you call that trade.
Gregoire: Trade barter system.
Shri Mataji: Barter system. The Swiss are very much against it, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah, really?
Sahaja Yogi: Bilateral goods trade.
Shri Mataji: You see and they going to be in trouble. You see, the Swiss are very poor, if you see them, they are very poor [unclear] in goods.
Gregoire: Of, course.
Shri Mataji: Very poor. Rustom, Gregoire. Sadhana had a visitor from Switzerland. And she was really aghast to see Sadhana's ornaments, which were not also, that she was using, not even from the bank [unclear] spoiled in the bank.
Gregoire: But it is true, Shri Mataji, because, you see, people, most people they have what they earn which is enough to carry the day, but they don't have any reserve.
Shri Mataji: You can’t buy anything.
Gregoire: They don't have. Arnaud and myself are good example Shri Mataji.
Sahaja Yogi: You can’t save.
Gregoire: We have.
Shri Mataji: But in America, it’s [unclear].
Gregoire: Thanks to ashram, thanks, I have been saving money since I left my house in Vienna, naturally, because if I live here-
Shri Mataji: You bought a house.
Gregoire: But if I have my own house I can't save the price, Shri Mataji.
Arnaud: Just one example: to move from one town to another town, because we had to go to Geneva, because there was no place no people in Geneva itself for meditation. No Sahaja Yogis, nothing. So we went to Geneva and all thing happened very sahaj, we got this flat for the time being. Just to move, I have to pay 4 to 5,000 Franks more a year, as taxes.
Gregoire: In rupees this is 20,000 rupees.
Arnaud: 20,000 rupees.
Gregoire: To move
Shri Mataji: It’s quite an artificial, this thing is. [Hindi]

[Unclear conversation]

Arnaud: Ashram is the best solution.
Sahaja Yogi: You can't buy property; we found out about that.
Sahaja Yogi: You can’t?
Sahaja Yogi: It's almost impossible to buy a house here.
Sahaja Yogi: Why?
Sahaja Yogi: Because you just pay back interest all the time. You can't pay off the capital because the interest is so high.

Shri Mataji: It’s not 7 feet, it is 8 feet about CP room’s height.
[About a photo] This is my in-law ... and this is my grand-children.
All right?
Sahaja Yogi: Which is, which one?
Shri Mataji: My room is 8 feet. Maybe little more. This could be 7 and half. This is my room, this one is, this is the-

[Conversation about measurements, the plans, low voices]
Sahaja Yogi: But I don't understand this part
Shri Mataji: So now, supposing you remove this, it is all together 22 feet. Now to raise this higher, what you have to do - [...]
[Many conversations at the same time]

Shri Mataji: So then, this if you can remove, you might get it higher.
Warren: You can take those two big beams out, big beams.
Shri Mataji: Four beams are there. You can put it up there
Warren: Relocate the big beams; and then put that across. From the same, I'm very much in favour of raising the height of your room.
Shri Mataji: Then you need not have it. Because that was the problem that's why we want to open it out. If it is permitted, then we’ll open it out, and it will be outside. But, as it is, if you raise it higher, there is more light.

Warren: In the Red Room in which you slept, there is about a 7-foot space in between. But above your ceiling, there is no space. You don’t have a reinforced ceiling in the Red room where you slept recently. It's about a 7-foot air gap.
Shri Mataji: That was broken.
Warren: But in the room in which you're going to sleep, your own room Mother, there is no gap. Those beams are the things on which the floor of the next ceiling.
Shri Mataji: I don't know why they
Sahaja Yogi: Somehow, they've done it like that. I don't understand it either.

Shri Mataji: You should better, you see [unclear].
Warren: If you look from the back of the house, when you're looking standing out in the garden, you can actually see the two levels change and the windows are at different heights; funny business.
Shri Mataji: We can do like this no problem.
Warren: It would be a good idea.
Shri Mataji: Like this but, it should not be showing in my room.
Warren: No, no. It won't show in your room. It will just make it higher.
Shri Mataji: Then only this problem is that of the height of which two people felt about my room, it is [unclear]. It’s very simple.
Warren: It's easy to achieve in the Red Room in your room we have to actually intrude into the attic.
Shri Mataji: Yes. And then you get the same height, you see.
Warren: Then you can have your chandelier.
Shri Mataji: Hum, then I can have.

Warren: The theory of the ‘watch this point’. He shouldn't go too far with the electricals.
Shri Mataji: In my room, he should forget this lamp. How is it in [unclear]? Nothing will matter in the lower part of it, only when it goes to one part, it is [unclear] part. It is not so difficult. This can be done in one day no problem.

Warren: Only thing, I didn't realize was there was seven and seven, 14 feet, from there to there.
Shri Mataji: No, because you go and stand underneath.
Warren: Yes, I'm with you. From the tippy, tippy top here.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is about 3 feet or four. No, this is about- it comes out as a dog, about 4 feet this one. This is the dog, about 4 feet, on top of that. Of course, seven.
Warren: Yes, correct.
Shri Mataji: Even if you have it up to this, it will be 8 feet height.
But if you going to put them up like that you see, like that and like that.
Warren: Bear them exposed.
Shri Mataji: And he's very anxious that we should put the exposed peace. Let’s see.
Warren: Well, it's a good idea, Mother. It gives the impression of space. You see, here, if you look from here, you can see an example, a perfect example.

It gives the impression of space. This is exactly as the attic is in your house. See those cross beams? I was walking on those beams when I was in the laundry, because there was a ceiling there. Actually, but actually –
[Gregoire speaks to Shri Mataji]

It gives the impression of space. This is exactly as the attic is in your house. See those cross beams? I was walking on those beams when I was in the laundry, because there was a ceiling there. Actually, but actually –
[Gregoire speaks to Shri Mataji]

The projection gives you the impression of space.
Shri Mataji: It’s true. No, these, of course, these are different. But he was saying also the slopy ones. You see, there are two types see there, see now. This one is one, one is, from here it starts, you see? These. Then they go up like that.
Warren: That's right.
Shri Mataji: So, these also, he was saying, should be exposed.
Warren: That's correct, yes. I'm saying that- oh, you're saying even more than this by showing the beans themselves.
Shri Mataji: Not only this, you are talking only about these.
Warren: So, in other words, It’s not lining up, but exposing the beams themselves.
Shri Mataji: No, lining, but between the beams.
Warren: Yes, between that's all right. This is neater and it's less work. This is easier job. The other is a big job because you have to cut lots and lots of little pieces and fit them in. But it doesn't matter.
Shri Mataji: Which is the big one?
Warren: The way you are suggesting, Mother, with the fitting little pieces in.
Shri Mataji: Then we can also put there those glass things.
Warren: Yes. Oh, you can put glass things in these. They've got examples in this house. You can still put the glass panels in, that's no problem.
Shri Mataji: On the top?
Warren: That’s no problem. Even in this house, they've got - I looked out the window - they've got big glass panels running in these houses. I'm surprised they haven't got any here.
Sahaja Yogi: On the other side you mean the window’s top.
Warren: Windows in the roof.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, there’s two.
Warren: In the roof, in the actual roof.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Gregoire: Yes, it’s on the other side.

Shri Mataji: Here if you make a window, it will make it weak, Warren. [unclear]
Warren: In this part, yes.

Shri Mataji: So, you like the exposed beans, Rustom?
Rustom: Exposed beans are fine, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: But looks rustic. So, let us make the upper part rustic. Let us make the children's thing rustic.
Gregoire: It's very cozy, Shri Mataji. If you would like to have a feeling of the place, perhaps you would like to just go up and see. It makes a very cozy feeling.
Shri Mataji: Children like it that's what I’m saying.
Gregoire: Yes.
Rustom: For you, Shri Mataji, I had one idea, that if you have a flat ceiling, it is better for a lady’s rooms.
Shri Mataji: No this is mine. You see, the thing is, [Marathi], raise it, that’s all.

Rustom: Then it’s much better.
Shri Mataji: No this is mine. You see, the thing is, [Marathi],
Rustom: Then it's okay.
Shri Mataji: They can have, they can have a rustic one.

Rustom: When I was a child, Shri Mataji, I used to enjoy these things.
Shri Mataji: Let them have the rustic things. We'll give them everything rustic.
Rustom: Also they’ll feel relaxed, Shri Mataji. Children don't like fussy things.
Warren: The absolutely plain, blank surfaces, they don't like either. Something which has a little change.
Rustom: Yes.
Shri Mataji: All right. We’ll make it rustic.

Rustom: Your ceiling should be well done.
Shri Mataji: Oh, that's all right. My ceiling is done. We are going to raise my ceiling. But then on top, whether to have the rustic- rustic is better.
Sahaja Yogi: If you have an English House of that age, Shri Mataji, certainly the woodwork inside is quite magnificent and strong.
Shri Mataji: They are very good.
Sahaja Yogi: And it is very valuable. It gives a terrific character in English house of that age.
Rustom: The only one could say, Shri Mataji-
Shri Mataji: And also I can get some nice carving, to put on them. It looks very interesting.
Sahaja Yogi: And brass, brass work.
Shri Mataji: [Marathi], we can get things from antics. In India, you get lots of things.

Rustom: You should have good insulation.
Shri Mataji: [Marathi].
Warren: You still have to have some of these cross tiles.
Shri Mataji: That will be part of the scaffolding. But whether the scaffolding should be exposed or not, is the point. Now as we have decided to have a rustic, you see, the get up of the house is majestic and more classical, you see. But the upper part, we can make it rustic.
Lower part is classical. Upper part to be rustic for the children. They like it.

Gregoire: It’s Ekadesha Rudra, Shri Mataji, isn’t it?
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: Ekadesha.
Shri Mataji: Ekadesha. Sahasrara.
Gregoire: Is it this place? Is this Burn’s?
Shri Mataji: No, no, this is the child [unclear]
Have you open my window in my room? You see, I wanted air to come in quite a lot. And oxygen is less, you see, at a height. You have less oxygen. It leaves your rooms closed also. There's no way of getting oxygen inside.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, wider, Shri Mataji. Ruth is very good with windows.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Now, can I ask one question? How much rent do we pay for this apartment?
Sahaja Yogi: It's about uh 2,000 Swiss Francks, a month, Shri Mataji. In pounds it's about,
Shri Mataji: One thousand?
Sahaja Yogi: 800 pounds a month.
Gregoire: It's not considered as expensive because if it would be in Geneva, it would be the double. Geneva is the most expensive place in Europe.

Guido: Like our ashram.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Guido: Like our ashram.
Shri Mataji: Which one?
Guido: Our ashram, in Rome, is nearly the same price of this flat.
Shri Mataji: My house in this thing is so big. You have seen that house now in Diallage [unsure], we are paying 13 hundred pounds.
Gregoire: 13 hundred pounds?
Shri Mataji: 13 hundred pounds.

Guido: We are living 51 people now there. We don't have any more private room, I mean, boys on one side and ladies on the other side. We don't have a husband and wife, we have not there. Because now it's emergency.

Shri Mataji: It's a very good way of doing that house, you see. And that's same style, I'm going to use in this house also, that we make lofts, halfway lofts. So, children can also sleep in the halfway lofts and also the [Unclear].
Waren: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So, there's a halfway loft, I’m going to have this. Like this. It’s very short.
Waren: In the long part of the house, we can put a halfway loft.
Gregoire: Yes. That's so cosy. There is an element of fun also. It’s a Swiss chalet.
Waren: It won't have any much height but it will be good. It will be lovely for the children. Shri Mataji: For children that is fine.
Warren: They can sleep upstairs.
Shri Mataji: Small children can sleep upstairs.
Waren: They can play on the on the lower level. It'll be a miniature of this room.
Shri Mataji: But you could have like this also if you want to cover. But you don't want to cover, then you can have just that. That would be something like their style, you see the rustic style.
Gregoire: This place, Shri Mataji is- but this is Italy, I would say, Shri Mataji, in Italy the Gruha Lakshmi or the Lakshmi is still there. First of all, the food is extremely good. In every restaurant, you can go, you are sure to get good.
Here, Shri Mataji, it is such to go out for lunch at noon. I have to go because I cannot sit 8 hours in my office, I get crazy. I have to go out but it is such a [unclear] in a restaurant. It's like putting that stuff within yourself. But in Italy, it's completely different. You enjoy eating. There is still something in the food. This is one thing. Then they have a lot of nice things which are not expensive, much more creative. Here for anything, Shri Mataji, you have to pay such a lot. It's ridiculous. A scratch, just a little scratch in the body of the car, costs you, a scratch, cost you 400 Swiss Francs. A scratch! If you have to fix it because of...
Shri Mataji: [Unsure] Yanka is so late to eat, they say so. In Yanka, there is [unclear] That's what it is.

I used to wonder why these ambassadors get such high pay and they have no money. But I don’t know money. Whatever they have got, it is in their own family like, it’s their savings. We too have saved our money not because of any this thing, only because I have been building houses after houses. Otherwise, we would have saved no money.
Gregoire: Because that's the way you regenerate capital.
Shri Mataji: Now CP, he just gets 4,000 pounds.
Gregoire: 4,000?
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: I was getting that, Shri Mataji.
Gregoire: Where? In Saudi Arabia?
Rustom: Hum.
Gregoire: You get 4,000 pounds a month.
Rustom: I used to get it before the riyals [unclear].

Gregoire: You see, Shri Mataji, what I get with a family of three children, is 6,000 Swiss Francs.
Shri Mataji: It's how much pounds.
Rustom That's about 12,000 riyals.
Shri Mataji: For a year?
Rustom: Per month.
Gregoire: No per month.
Sahaja Yogi: 2,400 pounds.
Gregoire: 2,400 per month. It's not a bad salary as such. But with the cost of living, you.
Shri Mataji: But I tell you with 4,000 also. Now see, 1,300 are going into just [unclear] with the thing. Electricity, gas. Our house is a big household, it's not a small household. All the time, we have –
Gregoire: He has no allowances, plus this?
Shri Mataji: I don't know but that's what he told me. I don't know.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, I mean, I don't Know.
Shri Mataji: He might be getting entertainment allows. But that is spend, over spend always from his salary. Now I mean, I just don't know how people can save money.
Gregoire: It's not bad Shri Mataji, because the head of certain agencies have the house provided. His residence is not provided? Because the head of the atomic agency, he has his residence provided.
Shri Mataji: Not anymore. So many people don’t have such things. You see, this fellow had, this UNESCO fellow. And they made such a big thing out of that.
Gregoire: He has a very bad reputation, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Gregoire, you see, it was built before he went. If you want to malice somebody, you can go. How can you go on explaining? This was built in the building itself. The whole building for UNESCO was created. In that, the flat was created for this one. And then when he came, he lived there. But other agencies don't have the house.
I don't know, but when it came out, the first thing when he was appointed, it was written that a house is given to me also. But I don't know. I never got a house from this. How are we to find out?
Gregoire: This, Shri Mataji, I can try to find out
It's probably different from one agency to another, Shri Mataji. Because I just find out that you are not getting any allowance for your private residence. And I'm certain that, for instance, that the man from the atomic agency, he gets private allowance. And even the UNIDO director he gets quite a lot of money it was passed by the board.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Gregoire: Yes. It was passed by the board of the of the United Nation industrial organization.
Shri Mataji: If he were getting then CP would not have gone in for house like this. He would have gone in for an expensive house. It doesn’t matter.
Gregoire: It's a small agency Shri Mataji, that’s why.
Shri Mataji: Maybe that.

Now 134 nations.
Gregoire: Yes, but the size of the- it's one of the smallest agencies in the system.
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can say that way.
Gregoire: Because UNESCO or FAO, they are 4,000 people, you know.
Shri Mataji: FAO, UNESCO, UNDP.

It's very funny because now, supposing we go to America, [unclear]. If you are a diplomat, you get a card and you get a, you don't have to pay the- what you call-
Rustom: The VAT [Value Added Tax].
Shri Mataji: The VAT. But not us.
Gregoire: You have to pay the VAT?
Shri Mataji: Always paid.
They say, "There is a card you have to get from the UN ". And they don't give it to us. The UN people should give it to us.

Gregoire: You have an official car?
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: Card, card.
Shri Mataji: CI Card. You get a card for VAT function.
Gregoire: And you didn't get, you don’t get it.

Strange. This must have happened when the British negotiated the seat agreement with IAMO at that time, long time back.
Shri Mataji: Long time back.
Gregoire: Long time back. Because it sounds strange to me. In Austria, I could get after P5, I think. People could get –
Shri Mataji: No, no. VAT in London, we get all right. No VAT in America. Anywhere else I can get, not in America.
Gregoire: Not in America. I mean, in America, think they're tougher than everywhere else. I would not get any privilege if I will.
Shri Mataji: I just don't know. Because [unclear] Not even ambassadors. We are also UN, part of the UN. It’s surprising.
Gregoire: So, ambassadors they give [unclear]
Shri Mataji: Anywhere. Every country they give ambassadors. Except in our own country, India. And in UK also we can get VAT. Now what about the VAT? Are we to pay VAT to this man? No?
Guido: No, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: We are not paying any VAT [unclear].
Guido: Yes, Shri Mataji. Gregoire will be corresponding the amount we are giving him in pounds, in travel checks. So, it will make the correspond little bit less.
Shri Mataji: But it should be done. You see, because before, within one year's time, I cannot take it to India. So as soon we do, the better, in a way.
Guido: We can organize uh by the 10th of September. We can organize by the 10th of September. So, if there is any lorry going to London with the bathrooms and so on, we can put.
Shri Mataji: Maybe do that.
Guido: Yes.

Shri Mataji: It’s very close to Milano.
Guido: It’s quite close, Shri Mataji. I already spoke with the man. And to them, it’s same thing deliver to Rome or deliver to Milano.
Shri Mataji: Then if you can't send it to Milano, then all the things are there.
Guido: Yes, Shri Mataji. Now the only thing now we have to give time to change the colour of some items. But I think they can do it quite fast.

Shri Mataji: Is there more duty for things that you get from Italy to Ganga?
Sahaja Yogi: It’s common market.
Shri Mataji: It’s common market. Not in India.
Sahaja Yogini: It's different it's different VAT from one country.
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?
Sahaja Yogini: It is different VAT from one country of the common market with the other one. They have not yet unified the level of VAT.
Shri Mataji: Are you sure?
Sahaja Yogi: That's not VAT we're talking about duty, customs duty.
Sahaja Yogini: There should not be.
Sahaja Yogi: VAT is local tax [unclear]. Custom duty into England.
Shri Mataji: I’m saying customs.
Gregoire: Within the common market?
Sahaja Yogini: They should not be but then they invent other things to still impose duty. But they should not be theoretically. But then they ask lots of paper, they might ask lots of paper say, "This is not allowed entrance in England because".
Shri Mataji: No, but I would give my passport.
Sahaja Yogini: Oh yes, then it’s fine.
Warren: In diplomatic case, Mother, there's no question. But if you don't want to involve CP-
[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: They try to show off [unclear] "Very difficult problems".
Gregoire: That's the essence of it. That's the essence of it. "This very important meeting". And this, "Your very lucid statement" and "the important recommendation that we have put forward".
Shri Mataji: We are legally, we are legally entitled.

Gregoire: A funny thing, Shri Mataji, is that while driving back from Shudy Camps. It’s not so interesting, I just mentioned to you. They saw your- we were driving on the highway, and there was a police car and they stopped us. And he was quite rude and-
Shri Mataji: Today?
Gregoire: No, no, when I came back from Shudy Camps.
Gavin: In your car.
Gregoire: In your car. No, I had driven the first half and then I was tired. So, the second half I had asked Mathias, no sorry, Marcus to drive. So, the guy asked him, "You don't have the right to drive this car and so on". Then I got up from the back seat, and I said, "This is perfectly all right and I showed my diplomatic passport". Then they went back in the in the Jeep and he looked at all the rules and regulations. And he told me- he is a stupid fellow because he didn't see that my passport had nothing to do with UK, you know. He is stupid. But then he said, "You should know". So, he assumed it was my car like that. He said, "You should know that you are not entitled to let anyone else drive this car these are the rules and regulation of this country that you should respect". I said, "Yes, sir, yes, sir. Thank you sir". Because I didn't want to create any problem and we drove. It was completely off his head. That's nice little example of bureaucrat. But actually, if I would not have a diplomatic passport, they would have made a fuss and annoyed Mr Srivastava.
Waren: There is a bureaucratic rule that says that nobody but a diplomat or his driver, his paid driver, should drive a diplomat car. That is the rule.

Shri Mataji: Or any driver [unclear]. That’s right.

Still there. Do a bandhan to that child
Gregoire: Inès or Shalini?
Shri Mataji: Shalini. What did they call her?
Gregoire: Inès.
Shri Mataji: Inès. What does that mean?
Gregoire: It’s a Spanish name.
Sahaja Yogini: Lamb.
Shri Mataji: What?
Sahaja Yogini: Lamb.

Shri Mataji: What does Agnes [Ag-ness] mean? Agnes.
Gregoire: Agnès?
Sahaja Yogini: It’s the same, it’s the same the same root, Shri Mataji. [Means pure; chaste]
Gregoire: Niranjana, you please be quiet. I just feel the Ekadesha Rudra, Shri Mataji.
Rustom: I feel Kundalini, Swadisthana, both.
Warren: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Warren: It’s every chakra, actually. They're all going like that.
It's the whole vertebral column. That's why I told him the head, it's Sahasrara.
Gregoire: But this is anti-God, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: She never [unclear] warm because of it. But she got her Realization, it was the only thing I had as a good favour. I mean, favour even before that she got her Realisation. She was not a born Realised, I think. He gave her Realisation.
Gregoire: To whom?
Arnaud: You mean to Shalini?
Shri Mataji: Yes. I don't know whether she was, because she had no vibrations when she came.
Arnaud: Shri Mataji, I remember that once I came to the hospital two days after the birth, I was not enthusiastic, I didn't come to the hospital. But just once, after she was about to die, I came and I give vibrations to her. It was the only time.
Shri Mataji: Hum? She was going to die?
Arnaud: She was about to die.
Shri Mataji: Who? This child? What?
Arnaud: Yes. She had something in the stomach. They lifted her.
Gregoire: The nurse put her in the wrong way, so the milk went into the lungs.

Shri Mataji: Oh. That was the reason they gave [unclear]?
Gregoire: Then they gave her antibiotics. At the age of two, three days.
Shri Mataji: They attack her heart.
Gregoire: Yes. It was at the age of two, three days, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Heart is very big. You must it to some [unclear]. How do you know she had a heart trouble?
Warren: Paediatrician, with paediatrician.
Shri Mataji: How the nurse could do that? You should pursue her.
Arnaud: But it was something amazing because she did know. It was when she had to go in the elevator at the moment, there was sort of a little shake, you know, because it was not on the same level, when she brought her on the elevator. And at the moment where she brought the little plan on this part, it gave a little shock. And at that moment exactly, she swelled out.

Shri Mataji: Maid.
Arnaud: Yes.
Shri Mataji: How she was ?
Arnaud: I don't know.
Shri Mataji: There was a bottle in there [unsure].

Arnaud: No, no, but she had the thing, I had the feeling she made a ‘renvoi’ [French word for vomit] she made a vomit and at exactly the same moment, it gave this shock.
Shri Mataji: And she was unsure.
Gregoire: Yes, she has fired the ...
Shri Mataji: Ans she was [unclear]. I think so because it’s rather sordid.
Rustom: Shri Mataji, Amelia said that apparently this child also has the same problem at the hips as Ruth's baby.
Shri Mataji: Who?
Rustom: Marie-Laure’s child. She has the same problem at the hips, as Ruth’s baby.
Shri Mataji: Really? When she was born.
Arnaud: Yes, this was the report of the doctor.
Sahaja Yogi: They will have to put also a harness?

Sahaja Yogini: She’s not sure yet.
Sahaja Yogini: She said it was not so serious.
Arnaud: But she wanted to hide it.

Gregoire: Is it too salty, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: [Unclear] get some oil.
Gregoire: It’s a bit too dry.
Shri Mataji likes, you know, juicy food, moist food she said this so many times.
Rustom: You could put also some olive oil, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You put some olive oil.

Arnaud: So, Shri Mataji, the whole thing was very dramatic; all the whole thing.
Shri Mataji: The father had no feeling for the child [unsure]. She said, "I was the first holding the baby in my hands". For 11 minutes or 12 minutes, she got [unclear].
Arnaud: You know why? Because Phil was blocked the jam. So he could not be there at the moment of the birth. Because Marie-Amelia has the flat very close to the hospital. She went to this Hospital.
Shri Mataji: And she had a caesarean.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: That [unclear].
Arnaud: She had infected- she had problems, a lot of problems afterwards.
[Unclear conversation]
Shri Mataji: She’s very normal. Radhika! Hello?

Rustom: This thing is quite strange. It has to be eaten with pepper and lemon juice on things.
[Unclear conversations about food]
Shri Mataji: Fish shouldn't be too dry. And people eat here very dry food.
Rustom: Not enough fat. They don't have fat in it.
[Unclear conversations about food]
Shri Mataji: If you eat fat food, this is all right.
Rustom: It’s fine, no problem.
Shri Mataji: No problem. [unclear] carbohydrate.
Gregoire: You know, [unclear] start this carbohydrate diet, no carbohydrate at all, only proteins.
Shri Mataji: This is done by a Sahaja Yogini, this one?
Sahaja Yogini: By my mother, Shri Mataji.

[Unclear conversations during food]
Sahaja Yogini: Chicken with sauce.
Shri Mataji: Chicken with sauce.
[Unclear conversations during food]

Kingsley: She's a Beauty when she smiles.
Shri Mataji: The smile is the child protocol [unclear].
[Laughter]
[Unclear conversation]

Shri Mataji: She was very fond of children [unclear]. The name of the child is Toby [unsure].That child it is, you know, the same face, don't you think?
Kingsley: Yes, yes. And the wonderful thing is, of course Shri Mataji, I have no more attachment, you know, since a long time for Toby which is good because that situation, of course, is disastrous.
Shri Mataji: Disastrous. I mean you were quite attached to him and well-meaning. It was good because he was a Realized soul. It’s a good child. But horrible woman, the mother.
Kingsley: It's very tragic, Shri Mataji. I heard a report from a third party, who vaguely knew my ex-wife. Only about a year ago, he telephoned me in Strasbourg. And he said that he had met my ex-wife and the little boy. And the little boy was running around in the street barefoot.
Sahaja Yogini: In winter.
Kingsley: In Winter. And when he said to this horrible woman, hello, she said, "Who are you? " He said, "I have an old friend of King. She said, "Oh, don't talk about him " and walked off in disgust.
Shri Mataji: Poor that child.
Kingsley: But the poor little boy!

Shri Mataji: You should pick him up.
Kingsley: He was lovely, wasn't he? Beautiful child.
Shri Mataji: Oh God! Horrible mother here. The father is not there.
Kingsley: Totally irresponsible, Shri Mataji. A drug dealer without any interest in his child at all.

Shri Mataji: Such a beautiful child like that. You know, you feel so surprised at that.
Kingsley: It's extraordinary when you see the parents, Shri Mataji. Two very ugly people and this beautiful little boy.
Shri Mataji: Beautiful child, beautiful child.
Kingsley: Whose child?
Shri Mataji: Really God sent him the way you [unclear]. I used to have a feeling for that child very much. Still I ask people, "How is he?"
[Unclear]. But what to do? This woman won't give him up.
Kingsley: There’s no chance in law, Shri Mataji. If I had thought that there was a chance, if I had thought I could even expose her and say, "Look at this woman and take him away". I mean. But because of her,
Shri Mataji: She was a drug addict, I think. Was she?
Kingsley: It's hard to say what she was Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: That’s what she was.
Kingsley: I mean, she was, as we say, clay in The Potter's hands. If a man came along and said, "Do this!" She'd do it, you know. I mean she had absolutely no roots at all.
Shri Mataji: Then let her go. I know. A hypocrite, such a hypocrite! But Toby, I did feel and I also feel that you were looking after him. He’ll come up. And what must be his age now?
Kingsley: He must be five or six now, Shri Mataji. I've kind of lost track. Yes he'll be six this year? 1980 he was born see I think.
Shri Mataji: Let’s see and ask, if you can find out. I mean, they don't even give up, you see. They use the child for oppressing. You see, they enjoy that. Why don't they give up their children? They kill their children, strangle their children, do all kinds of things, you know, in England. Why don't they give their children to somebody?

Kingsley: She couldn't discipline him, Shri Mataji. For instance, at one point, he took to doing his business under a table. And she used to laugh! And I used to say to her, you know, this is ridiculous.
Shri Mataji: Well, that not the [unclear]. But she should not use him for her sadistic things. But there is no arrangement, I must say, there, in that country. And I asked some people, you see, they are fed up of their child, somehow. I said, "Why don't you send them to an orphanage?" They said, "There’s nothing".

Kingsley: Whatever the state of the parent, the relationship is held to be absolutely sacred and holy, even if the parent is a complete devil.
That parent has the primordial right to do with the child as he wishes. Until someone comes along and says, "Oh he's beating him". And as you know, there have been so many cases of child abuse.
Shri Mataji: Every day, every day, two, three children are killed. Every day! It's a common thing. But leave alone that, what I'm trying to say, supposing if some parents do not like their children, it is very absurd, but supposing, there is no even place where they can put their children.
Gregoire: Yes, there are Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: No, no. Not in England.
Gregoire: Orphanage?
Kingsley: It doesn't work. It's not in England
Shri Mataji: It’s not existing.
Gavin: It's an old-fashioned idea. It doesn't exist anymore.
Kingsley: Yes. But if you said that, if you it in public that, "I don't like my child I give it to [unclear]" I mean, it be a human cry, you see.
Shri Mataji: They will kill the child. I mean, one child was put in the attic, tied up, with everything in the mouth. And just died.
And they have got a security- what you call that?- from the government, they come and see.
Gregoire: Tutor.
Kingsley: Oh, the welfare officers. Yes. The welfare service.
Shri Mataji: It’s not this. If you see a child having a second wound, immediately, this is that he is beaten by the parents. [Marathi, Isn’t it] Rustom? You were telling me that if they find any child being -
Rustom: Injured.
Shri Mataji: Injured twice.
Rustom: And I was talking to David just now, Shri Mataji, he said it's become now so common, that now that any child who comes into the hospital, they immediately suspect the parents.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Gregoire: Narak. Narak.
Rustom: It’s common and common now Shri Mataji.
There was one woman Shri Mataji, I know, who stuck pins into a child's body, whole, complete. And when the child died, they found 200 pins in his body.

Shri Mataji: I just don't understand. Also, there are no orphanages, isn't it? That's a fact.
Rustom: There are not orphanages, but homes.
Shri Mataji: Parents don't send their children to the homes.
Rustom: Not for parents. It's for children who have no parents.
Warren: It's for wayward children or children without parents. It's a state it's a state institution for abandoned children.
Shri Mataji: Now for [Unclear]
Warren: But you can't send children where you've got a perfectly normal situation, no.
Rustom: Although if you have a danger, a risk to the child.
Warren: Ah. If the child becomes a state ward, protected by the state, away from his parents, the parents -
Shri Mataji: Already, you send them.
Kingsley: They're taken away.
Warren: They are taken away.
Shri Mataji: Then they put them where?
Kingsley: Well, in these homes. Like for instance, Simon, Simon O’Connell, as you know, he was once in this sort of homes.
Shri Mataji: Yes?
Kingsley: Because he was in a children's home, wasn't he?

Shri Mataji: Simon. Paul, Paul.
Gregoire: Paul Winter also?
Kingsley:: Yes, Paul Winter was in that -
Shri Mataji: But he had no parents. She had a mother.
Warren: I was the same, but I was taken as a little baby, much younger than you.
Shri Mataji: No but, he, Simon had a mother.
Kingsley: Yes, it's very strange.
Shri Mataji: There’s no father.
[Unclear conversation]

Kingsley: But I have to say, Shri Mataji, it's very sweet. That Radhika has.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Kingsley: But I have to say it's very sweet that Radhika has, as he is saying, the same kind of lovely sweetness and cheekiness that Toby had. It's very beautiful.
Shri Mataji: Yes. He’s a very good child, very good. He’ll come up. Don’t you worry. He’ll come up.
[Unclear]
I don't think that anybody can suppress that personality.
[Laughter]

Gregoire: It’s clearing out now. No?
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?
Gregoire: It seems a bit lighter, Shri Mataji, isn’t it?
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: It seems that it has cleared out quite a bit.

Warren: Very strong baba [to his child].
Shri Mataji: It compensates sometimes. Like when you started talking about Toby, vibrations cleared out. Because you know, as a mother, I feel concerned about children too much. Too much.
Gregoire: But this is our luck, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: This is our luck and we abuse and abuse of this.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: How is that Bhavani?
Guido: Well, Shri Mataji, she's a bit like an actress.
Shri Mataji: Ah!
Gregoire: Guido and his reports are very interesting.
Shri Mataji: I know. So now, what you to do?

Guido: Well, just to be strict with her and don't pay any attention, in any form.
Warren: Did you hear how she performed when she arrived in the ashram?
She laid down on the floor for two days.
Guido: Yes. Just she has to know that, if she doesn't behave normally, nobody will take care of her.
Shri Mataji: Nobody is?
Guido: Nobody will take care of her, if she does not behave normally. So, she is– because the ‘badhas’ want their attention.
Shri Mataji: No attention to her.
Guido: The badhas want the attention. In a way or in another way, they want the attention.

[Unclear conversation while eating]

Warren: Speedy Gonzalez. [To his child]
Shri Mataji: Poor John, he is tortured.
Sahaja Yogi: Speedy Gonzalez. [To his child]
Shri Mataji: If he gives it back to his [unclear]? It’s very hard.
John should give her up, I think.
Warren: I think he's pretty fed up with the situation, Mother. I don't think he's very much attached to.
Shri Mataji: And this lady is telephoning to Doctor Brian Wells. But my husband says, "You are [unclear], this, that".
Gregoire: Come down and have your dinner. [To children]
Shri Mataji: Bhavani should go and stay with her mother now. In case you find it.
Gregoire: Come down with Machindranath and have your diner. [To children]
Shri Mataji: I’ve got the report with me, I ‘ll go through that. I’ll tell John about it. John told me the same thing. He said, "Mother, she is so clever!"

[Unclear conversation about children coming for diner]

Guido: She will come up, Shri Mataji.

[Conversation with children coming for diner]

Guido: I'm quite confident, Shri Mataji, she will come up. Because the last time, we made a mistake.
Shri Mataji: All right.
After what happened?
Guido: Well, we were too much uh-
[Warren to his child: Cross your leg sit ready for the food when you're sitting ready people]
Guido: Poor thing, poor her, we made a mistake last time. We didn't understand which kind of badhas were active.
[Warren to his child: You come and sit here.]
Shri Mataji: Poor John, he had a bad luck.
[Unclear. Warren talking at the same time]

Shri Mataji: First, we tried with that Victoria. She was a mad woman. Then we tried with this girl. You see, that's why they try to do some program in Scotland. It could not work out at all! Not one person used to come there. Even those that we sent them got [unclear]
[Warren to his child: It's a bit old fashioned, isn’t it?]

Shri Mataji: Today, she was explaining me about Jane, how she is, how she behaves.
[Warren is talking to his child.]
Shri Mataji: She is Ukrainian, is she? It’s somewhere near Biello-Russia, I think. And then she described. And I have seen that. Like, you see, if she has to do something, you tell her, she doesn’t know how to cook. [Unclear]
"All right, you go and now clean the utensils". I've seen this myself. And she said, "What about the gloves? "What gloves I should have?" And "What about the [unclear]? Then this won't fit me, can I use yours?" "I can't do that. So, should I get another one for myself? "

Kingsley: Quite extraordinary, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: "One for myself, I must have". Like that, she goes on complaining. I’m in the dark. But she may not do it at all.

Kingsley: The very strangest thing Shri Mataji was, the very strangest thing about Jane when she first came was, that she very much reminded me of my ex-wife who was also called Jane.
Shri Mataji; Really?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, very much indeed, very much the same sort of bhoots. I felt very much that you were working something out there, in my past, because it happened the same time.
Shri Mataji: But the coming was, you see, at least you were with her, you could see what sort of possession. But Gavin used to impose her on us. Always. Always.

And this time, I rang Gregoire. He said that, Gavin said that, "Gregoire has telephoned that he wants to know what is going to happen with my ex-wife next and this and that". And then, immediately, he said to me, "Mother, I’d better tell him what I did to him. I don't want him to trouble you anymore".

He used to impose her on us. She must receive the phone. She must take out. She must shout at Gregoire. She must shout at everyone. He would never confront her, never.
[Warren is talking to his child]
Shri Mataji: That is what he is saying. Never confront her.
[Warren is talking to his child]
[Unclear]

Shri Mataji: There was a Chinese lady who was there to stay. It was a very nice person, who is working. And she used to tell her left and right, "My daughter wants this, my daughter wants that".[Unclear]

And not paying for anything whatsoever. I was fed up with her.
Kingsley: Mad people have great convictions.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Kingsley: Mad people have great convictions.
Shri Mataji: They have what?
Kingsley: They have great convictions.
Shri Mataji: And confidence.
Kingsley: And confidence.
Shri Mataji: They have confidence, mad people. Really, I tell you.
Very great confidence, they have, that’s all. [Laughter]

Arnaud: Even they are maybe proud.
Shri Mataji: But the worst part is that she thinks she was very popular. It’s really surprising.

She would telephone to everyone, to tell them "Do this". I told her, "You are not to that. Gavin is doing that, why are you doing it for him? "
[Hindi conversation]

Maria-Amelia was telling me that the dresses here are so expensive!
Arnaud: Shri Mataji, a piece of cloth, crazy piece of cloth, it's absolutely out of the blue.
Shri Mataji: What do you mean so far?
Arnaud: Any kind of little things you buy, just a shirt or something like that, is extremely expensive, extremely expensive. What we do Shri Mataji, we never before it is discount.
Shri Mataji: No, when you come to England, you buy there. When you go to India, you buy there.
Arnaud: That we are starting to do, Shri Mataji.
Gregoire: All my cloth, I bought them in Italy.
1:05:40

I, I also for cotton clothes and it's cotton shirt for 45 minutes you can get a beautiful cotton shirt and it lasts if we buy, even if we buy shoes now it only lasts one year at the most we buy there. 

They don't know how to to make the things and and to wash the hands here. to go to a place in to buy and it's much better quality and finish off what's on your plate now, no, no, this is not the time to. No, it is no use having a big pain. But I think what is very expensive is the red New York put it in my plate that I solve your problem. I'll get a house for you put it on according to Doctor thank you. Thanks for your blessing. They called me in another bank for. Uh, in financial. Um, advisor, financial advisor, they called me. I didn't want to change the when they called me.

They will pay me more money and then in one year's time I will have one week more holidays and I will be able to. To have more money for everything for Saturday, but it is a beautiful thing, but it was, it is necessary if you want to carry on for our projects, if we want to build on the school and we have to have a strong income. And we are saving a lot of money. There is no doubt about it, but there is one thing we need money for when we go to Puja weekend with 3 children, it's it's its if it falls you'll be surprising the whole of here. We have had only 3, let's see which one was in Italy and one was here it was, but only 3. What what how much you charge for 40 pounds 40 pounds. I. 5599 to 5 and this one is. 4045. Hey It's nothing similar to you.

And also you see you're saving on that. You're having a holiday, you're enjoying yourself. You're saving on that. So I don't think pua is such an explicit thing for you. Now for I they they have 3 we have one puja in the 4. Then We have also the 11 food how distributed, one in uh Australia, one in America. Why did I take that. Uh, 33 in India. India, more because of the Shivaratri which becomes 4 in India. Christmas is fine, but that's poor.

Then 23575 should be 11. Mm. We in India, so that's. So the pressure on India is the West is not getting so. They have 7 we evolve as a matter of fact. If we have been carrying on very comfortably despite all the expenses of Sahaja Yoga lifestyle is the cheapest of all. It's the cheapest. It's really the cheapest of all holidays. Oh no, we live in between. I mean, we are waiting, we are leaving for, for, for this meeting.

It's fantastic. We don't need any holiday. haematology, what, what I would haematology, what, what I would like to do but I don't know whether uh. That's possible, but it should be perhaps. As you know, in September or October, I'll get an answer about this UN job. if it works out, what I would like to do is to end my work here with a diplomatic service at the end of December and start my job in New York in March or so. January, February. Or something like that, and perhaps that would be a little bit uh. Do a little bit. You know, a little bit more constantly, let's say in a long period in in India or something.

either in India or have a longer period sometimes off the job not only, I don't know if you are in India, but I can follow you or something like that because I've not done this for some time for a long period, I mean. But I don't know. I mean, only if it's a sense, if there's no sense, I would not do it. I can. But like. Srima. Is it? which I got from part of it because he has put his money into something and I don't know some sort of an investment. Which gives him about more than double. After how long can I see?

She says it's pushing something I don't. And 5, so I said I don't, I'm not so much for money, but of course the money will be lost, but in the meanwhile you will also have something there for surgery, we agree. So it allowed me to keep as much money for surgery as long as but I worked it out as long as I mean I will get as much as if you get all I get money. No problem. And so you will also have no problem on drugs. I mean, I will pay whatever whatever I have to pay. I mean, I don't need, I don't intend to make savings on your house, you think about it you can always get a house something like that, but you have a nice. It's impossible impossible. That's what I'm telling you to buy that we could then have it evolving in a centre like in other countries and proper surgery centre start as an ashram and then. Otherwise we gather horrible people.

In any case, you must be in America. In America, we don't let anybody not pay rent or not be working who's in the ashram unless it's a lady's expecting a baby or something. I don't have that problem. I'm like oh I know. That's only in England we have. to go back up and then now they gave us this call call that we got you know but now we got to call that is a practical then with this another house we got huge big building we have in uh. That was The thing you you come there. Nightingale. That was fantastic. We lost this because of our foolishness of that one that one was for a short time, but she was doing nothing and that has nothing practically.

Yeah, we got people with pain that you got. With altogether 25, is it 25 pounds per day a week with food. But the money was lost because of this horrible fellow. Nick, the money was with him and he just got lost no time, but this is not that they get it free now they have got one there was one. It was uh Just free about free and was sold to Doctor Wells and uh uh Jason Jason for a sock. For a son, 30,000 or something. Oh. Huge big houses and that. Another one is now uh which is called the Shin Cross. It's quite a big house.

I've been there. And the most uh remarkable place also very much in the centre. Absolutely people are not being a single, not a single. because you don't touch it, you're sitting before the doctor. Yeah But this is true communism Shrimataji actually inja Yoga because also the, the, the attachment to objects also drops. I mean one is perhaps one get attached to few material things in fewer. The thing is that there's also attachment actually in a way proper way of think. You don't neglect that, look after that. The thing is not that you are attached, but if you see that you can give it to others enjoy to others or seeing these things makes you joyous and happiness not you don't possess anything that's. Or to give it to others in any way.

If you understand the utility of matter, that it is driving it, then you look after it, but they don't look after it. That was what that worked out in Vienna in in the flat we had in Vienna because that's the way really saw Yoga started there that they could feel the kind of home and they would feel at home, and yet it was because it was very respectable, so that was controlling the ego. A lot of people got the ego control only by the quality of the furniture at the beginning. At the beginning, they confess to me later on. You see, when people come in your place, if you have a nice, nice stylish furniture, then it's all good taste, they, they keep quiet because at the beginning, it helps, all these things help. That's why, I mean, I, if we have a respectable environment, it works. But I don't know. All my furniture was called. I gave all my furniture with the. I in fact a state.

But it's dirty and rickety. But it was in Austria actually Ma, I don't think it would work in England. I'm a little fearful when Shodiam comes and this beautiful house is a little exposed to the Sajags in the kitchen and things. I'm a little worried. Yes, no, the only, the only way, Warren is to absolutely enforce the rule that nobody comes who is not invited. It's absolutely crystal simple, clear, and if anybody comes, it's just asked to leave within the five coming minutes. Well, we're doing that, but I'm thinking more of the time when the beautiful furniture is there and the whole thing. But then if these are invited people, I think that should be all right. There are already done like this in that house, I think that part of the whole thing see we must face the again. So what I've done, we have got a staircase which is in the front side which is here it's.

So we get that one excuse that's only for people when detriable people come in or something like that to go as mothers, mothers, mothers. Oh Hopefully I want to invite some ambassador or something. Now the another side is from where the other side is, you see that side we have put the kitchen, the dining room which opens out and all that, and also bathrooms for people and also one of the rooms which is supposed to be the what you call the doctor's cabinets thing that but that door thing is not to be used firststairs. Then we have got 3 rooms upstairs. Which rooms for doctors family, but the, the going up is going to be through the, the side of the service it's not service, it's quite nice staircase, but double staircase, so they don't go when you go to the IT. Then then what happens after? Uh, there's a, we have opened out everything, so it's a huge big stuff. If you can sleep there, if you have big groups, they can sleep there, you can have the, there's going to be bathrooms and all that. Attached to it, so if a big group suddenly comes in, they cannot sleep. They can't sleep and if the children are there, if there are children, the children can sleep there also.

I I think we have a children's, uh, this thing, you see, now, uh, when we call you say as soon as you start talking of school we have oxygen. That The we have we have a picture. They'll come and see me, check whether the children. Now that is pretty farfetched now for us, the schools are only the children of the surgeries can stay there. Now such a large place area is there up there which we make nicely and for children also they can stay, we can look after the children from 2 to 5, they will be also the children only. We not have children from outside there because as soon as we say about children from outside, the legal side comes in. They'll come and see the play. That's over. So far today, but later on if you can have a school somewhere there or make another school building there or something, then we can have these scholars and these children can stay if they have people staying in the place. Now the another problem is now this is that and they all go up to one staircase, come down by one staircase.

They use the bathroom. They don't come this side. So now in the name of mother what. First we have a huge long thing on meditation long thing downstairs starts from from the stairs see beyond the stairs it starts goes from the stairs we open also at least 2 hours from there up to the end of it, up to the end of uh the so-called kitchenau up to that, even beyond that is the medication. So they come for meditation down, come down, sit down for meditation. Nobody climbs. Um This is very good and that's all that is my medication now. Now, upstairs, I have a bedroom. One side, there's another additional bedroom and a sitting room, that's OK. Downstairs now we are thinking of having a kitchen. It's done in the drawing room and the dining.

So there are drawing room and dining room behind that but one side is drawing room and dining room and in between is the stairs. Behind that you are going to have a what you call a kitchen called serving room. And that will be just used for some people, respectable people, high class people, as you call them or whatever. So If you step there, have to impress her. But we cannot say that people won't come. They'll come for Saturday, Sundays anything we can charge them. They can come. We can have a booking for them. We can charge them some money. They'll stay upstairs attic sleep there, the bathrooms, everything, we can charge them money because that is one way we can really stimulate uro anyway, so we cannot just say that nobody can come they can come.

But they have to inform us, tell us how many are coming to their leaders, come down or say one Saturday, Sunday in a month or twice in a month. You can come down, lie down to that place, stay over, work it out, meditation, everything, everything like that, and then as they have got last from, but in the ashram itself just now only the doctors will be safe only. Maji, where, where do you intend to put the kind of guest bedroom because if I understand correctly, there is your quarter, then there are rooms for the doctors who are resident doctors, and somewhere, no, the attic is for children and for Saog, but you have to have somewhere a very because if you have a visitor who is a senior visitor or something and you want to say that there is something. It could be used by CP or it could be used, things like that or even I mean if your family is there. Is it the house behind you if we get that the house behind it we can get that, that the house behind now the house behind what something to buy there. They want to buy in I do. That's quite a nice house. It's quite cosy. It's a very old house, so, but it's very high. So I told them how I think what we need is to do a couple of a and at midnight in the garden.

What is that a couple of bus at midnight in the garden and probably the price will come down after one year. Now another thing is that if you get that house, then we definitely have for the leaders can stay there whenever they come we can even for doctors. I mean we have posted guest house then we are going to somehow manage to get the houses. But just now we are buying the 14 or 15 acres of land that we are buying. That is really the core and the centre of Saja Yoga in England when we have all that area. Nobody can. What we do this is our own property. Oh yes, we'll do whatever we like. It's very good, Chamata. If pragmatically we can develop some some consultancy business either Doctor Warren or Doctor Spiro or, for them it is easy for them to go to Cambridge and do the consultancy on Saturdays, Sundays they attend to experiments they are going to join it.

Thanks, because Oh you don't know about that. Doctor Rai, who's the professor and dean of the faculty of physiology in the medical school of Delhi University, has a number of Sajobi, one or two doctors doing doing a MD, which is a doctor of medicine in Sardioga, looking at the parameters of medicine of physiology and seeing how in a Sajoogi compared with a control group. I already, already they have published and they have already submitted it. But what and this doctor will got a doctor of medicine. So they'll get it, but what mother has gone a little step further in suggesting that extramuralally. David Spiro, Bogdan, and people like that can in fact do the same research here in. And he, he's written to us saying that very happy to do it and we'll award you first a PhD and then a whatever. Ahi Mataji is your strongest body of professionals in Saja Yoga are doctors, interestingly enough. I study medicine you say what is the other thing. In London there's a in England I think I'll see that there was sushi.

These 4 people can call an associate and can take a place in Cambridge on higher and an associate. See, I can consult people there. You can use that place for your own consultation in the weekdays and at weekends you come back. I mean you, you can say that it's only hardly 16 kilometres by shortwave it's 12 kilometres. Tremendous potential. It's much more and all of us a lot more I want to make it uh there something the kind we saw a theatre. And the art place all sorts of things a whole, a whole creative environment, agriculture, everything, an integrated multi-purpose living organic constable used to paint that constable used to paint very near there. So it's all the whole thought. And all the schools in England, they went to Cambridge, not to Oxford, you know. I'm, I'm neutral.

I went to both. Augustine was born somewhere near Oxford. No, no, no, Saint Augustin, North Africa, North Africa. You see, there's a church there very near Oxford that, very famous church, and they said that he was the first, uh, still there in that church. You might have sent someone is an English Augustine, not the August. There are two Augustines, now it's the English one, and there's the big Augustine who was the Bahaboot. He was an English um no no no the real one was from, he was from North Africa because at the time of the Roma North Africa was very rich. He bought his colour you were the white man we don't. His name is Saint. His full name is Shimai is Saint Augustine of Hippo.

Hippo. No, he, he was, he had the same thing. He must have had a big molara chakra problem, Shri Malaji because in his writing, as in the writing of Paul, there is a kind of confession of this business. There were people he was a Roman by nationality as was Paul. Paul was a Jew of the of the diaspora, which is Turkey, and yet he he was a Roman citizen. And became very strongly a supporter of the Augustine who was horrible fellow they say who was another one who was looking after this church long time back. It is one of the oldest church near Oxford. There was one Augustine who came as a missionary, the one that we refer to in the Anglican Church. There is nothing to do with this August he read the Celtic church, the Cambridge. I don't know whom they had Newton.

a whole range of when we started our programme in Oxford we just couldn't. Oh, there was one fellow who stayed on and he he made us ma. I'm just I'm the only person. it means the crossing of the river ox. Ford is crossing, the kind of wherever you have Ford Shrimaji, it means the river crossing. Oh Stratford, Stratford, Stratford, like all of them, all of them, yes, where you go through the river, you know, shallow of the river, no, no, it's, it's the name of the way you cross the river instead of a bridge, you used to just go through the river it was a shallow and that's it. 4 shallow part of the river where you can drive through. Oh, that's called a. And Oxford was called the River Ox River axe, it's the River axe, isn't it actually it comes from. The Oxford.

Ted. I'm not sure. I think that that is, it's an old English thing. I, what I am fascinated about sumatji is what in old English is Shudy because the spelling S H U D Y is absolutely untypical. I suspect it comes from the old. Danish word is not French was French. You'll probably find it's changed and changed and changed, what do you think from the old English? Well, I don't know it may very well be a compound because often in England you have the first part of the name. Um, like Hampton, both means ham means town and Tom means town, and so it's really town town depending on which age which who who invaded at that 0.10 for the first time belonged to Earl Harrow. I like that.

I It's amazing. Apparently it was part of his domain. And despite everybody's, it must be very old because it's a very atypical name in English when you have a word that was that was that area belonged to him first of all when he started dealing and the record is from 100. But still you see you still love it. it is unconventional, but do you know the land records are there, but registration is not there of that land. They said 80% of the urban land is not it. I have That must be old common land, I suppose, from when it was sort of old forests that everyone had rights to. And Shrimataji nearby is Castle camp. Nearby is the the village of Castle Camps. So it looks very much as if Castle Camps was where the where the the Lord had his territory and probably the the local castle and Shoy camps.

Shuy must relate to the the people or something like that, but it's a, it's a very old word. It it must go back a long, long, a long way before the Norman conquest right back to the Danes because the. You see this statue of his mother. What's it called? The god may go kill. I went there once looking for wild orchids through Mata. What is it called? These are the armies of evil which are supposed to come 1000 years after the coming of Shri Kalki because according to Saint John, the coming of Shri Kalki opens a period of peace of 1000 years and then at the end of this, the armies of Gog and Magog, which are evil forces unite. To destroy the good that is in 1000 years from now or from the manifestation of Fri and then they'll be definitely destroyed. That's what John says actually Gog Magog is the name of the Devi in the Nordic.

Is that a lot of the day you've probably seen Gog Magog is given a number of explanations from a number of different languages, but in the northern languages, Nordic and North German languages, it is directly associated with the female goddess figure who was to be worshipped by ritual, and she was worshipped by ritual because they found. In the layers of soil, they found evidence of oils and all these different things that were used in certain places. So a lot of ritual went on there. Some of it was not very nice, but the basic stuff at the beginning was. There's a goddess called Kali. There's a goddess of the moon, black goddess of the moon called Kali. same thing same thing same same, yes, and she was, she had big teeth and with blood and she used to wear no clothes and she's sitting on the, on the horse, the animal that looks like a horse. And she's got this stylized face and the tongue comes out and you don't know, it's in the side of a mountain. It's called Kelly K K A L I K A L I C H. Amazing and she's the goddess of trees and things. And she comes out at night only.

That's true. It's been thoroughly documented in this little book. I'm looking for a break because I, I smell this book very well. Mhm There's no question it was a place of worship. And ritual of the goddess. See, I tell you, the Hebrew Bible is also different from this. I don't think they actually use the word, I know, but it's, I think it's a might be 17th century edition is the 17 you mean the original Bible that I don't know. Because this horrible fellow Paul? No, not Paul August Augustine English Bible is that it was the first to translated it because see what happened when I'm bullying. Mother, would you like some ice cream.

I've had some. They kind of. I'll tell you how Arabic you can work. How do you have a in this. It is. I'll read it to you like it's it's in old. Oh yes, yes, please. And when the 1000 years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. Really? Go my go.

And what else? That. What was the name of God which I what I'm amazed because when I heard about this gogo, I was sure it was coming from a Hebrew tradition at my English, see how they translated. You see, maybe the English might have called it up. You see, this is what I'm mentioned and they and they went up on the breath of the earth and compass the camp of the saint about and the beloved city. They attacked the new Jerusalem and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them, and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the peace and the false prophets are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever. And then come Shri Mataji Shri Krishna, and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them, and I saw the and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and so on and so forth. It's beautiful. Yes, in, in modern English rimaji, when the 1000 years are over, Satan will be let loose from his dungeon, and he will come out to seduce the nations in the four quarters of the earth and to muster them for battle. Yes, the hosts of Gog and Magog, countless as the sands of the sea.

It is 1000 years after the coming of Shri. Now what I'm saying. That this might be the name given to that particular statue by English. From us Maybe the English must have taken it from him and in order to in order to degrade it corrupt it in order to degrade it, that's uh that's what I think is so we should rebaptize I read in the book Spirals. And Kali has a daughter who's very interesting who is the goddess of the moon in the Shukla. Kali is the goddess of the moon and Krishna and this is like a young girl. Where is it that you just in the the book was that this is the name. Yes, that's the name used to describe one of the old what probably is this must have been the name they must have given to her. But it doesn't look like anything like English name. That whole area just it it's very historic.

They also had too much in that property had human sacrifice. You sacrifice men to the father. Except for one queen Odysia who used to sacrifice women to come. I. Yeah that's right, but the tonnes also used to do. It's pretty frustrating for. It's bad. This is also typical Shrimataji of even now there is this guy who made a couple of big hits. In films, the one who made the Temple of Doom, what is his name? Indiana even Spielberg, even Spielberg is a big, uh, me and a big film register filmmaker. I don't know if you in English, but he depicted India through these horrid traits of human sacrifice, human sacrifice and all that didn't understand anything about India.

This is what they always do. They just pick up exactly in order to feel good to be white man, you know. They're really dogs. They don't understand. I've seen nowadays it's used to do it huggery was there in the time of the British Thuy was there these people used to, but I mean even today we have hugs in every country. Shibatajim, may I just ask you a question which always puzzled me a little bit. Uh, why, why is, uh, SATI by burning oneself on fire? Is there a special reason to be fired? Do you suffocate very rapidly? Do you die very fast.

Didn't she, yeah, the, the, yes, the, the daughter of, so that's why, no, because she, she, she, yeah, yes, that's right, because they were going to get into mess without. Yes she want to do, but the the the custom that when the husband was there. No, no, because always we have a fire, then we burn the body, we don't hurry. But is it, is it a very painful death, or, or you get an oxygen very fast because it's, I, I find it very strange that women get burned when their husband dies it's conditioning of the mind. It had become a because this is Bra Brah. What had started that it was not a very old custom it started much later when the Brahmins took over at Brains what they said that the wife should be dedicated to the heart. And when she became a widow, it was an impossible life for me. Her hair was cut and she was in prison. That's why my forefathers became Christians. All these things are done to a widow.

This is family. And when all this was done, you see. The women thought best escape would be. They asked them how to live as a widow. They said no need to live. You can kill yourself with your husband and you will go to the ms after all nobody dies. Very nice, very nice, but this hasn't got no divine sanction. This is no divine sanction. No, what was this Joo, that one was you see Yohar is a because fire is a fire is the way we want to finish our body, yeah, nobody buries the body. Yeah, they always, uh, put to the fire except for the real life.

Except for the ra, anybody has to be put. And so these ladies were used to be alive when they went, they used to jump in alive. That's why and I was the hard work how to kill yourself was the main thing. How to kill yourself. Now supposing you jump from somewhere. That time also these men would have used the dead bodies polluting their bodies with fire nobody can touch. OK So did, did any of them get the realisation while jumping into the fire or anything not that way. It was just to say that was very important for now, but it's a s. A woman would jump. I mean, even now I've known many women who jumped out of their, uh, uh, high ceilings and this and that because a man tried to sort of them. It's an auspicious thing that way in that way it's an auspicious.

Testity was so important as to say that test it would be when you burn your body nobody can touch you after that your body becomes up you know that's why. body remains pure pure. Oh yes, that's what they felt that, uh, I mean chastity is so important because it's a question of their power because according to their philosophy, nobody does. That's why you get reborn, but if you commit uh and chest pain, then you then, uh, you get, uh, seen on. Yeah But this is not an auspicious was auspicious so that's not. Sati was the one who would. Actually It was also girls too, but when she did it, she did it with her love for her husband because she knew she did not exist. Well they had such intense love once upon a time they had. I mean, I had seen my own mother like that. See, when my father died, my mother was sitting like this.

Foot, I mean, on the foot side of the face. And she didn't get up from there at all. She was just sitting there, and one night all her hair became white, all her hair. But after that, she never walked, she could never walk. She just died off in a way. gave up. Oh yeah, I've seen it myself. What about this sort of situation in modern Yoga? This sort of situation in modern Saha Yoga. I see what the body is supposed to be buried, not burned, of course, but you don't expect women to do this sort of sacrifice after their husband.

No, they're not I mean here there is no attachment with the husband at all. There's no such a if there is apartment like that. I mean, you are here for God's work. So that's that's our hope. I mean if your husband dies earlier, that means you have to work harder. It's out of date, it is out of state, out of state. Thank you. Yes, you are in a different state. Uh, that's all the old drama, drama drama, yes, that is all and all this. You see really in India women were very attached to the SATI things if you I mean were such powerful women.

I have told you stories about Mandari and this one was also another. A very famous. She, her husband became leper and she carried him. He became a. I cherish no not Nirma. On the side of one I guess you One of the He becamela and she took him around and Sati also this one was uh Lashman's daughter who was uh. The one was taken by. She was a too. And uh, what was the name I was telling you about some la. Do the discharge. I So one of my day is not the night.

I. Left to to put the drugs. Do it now. But. Most of the SATI, no, most of the SATIs were on the left. Right, the power of the left on the right. Well, the main thing was attachment to uh attachment to her. And uh Mulabara was a strong, so left but the. Uh, power or the right? So that's a tree.

There are uh uh uh snat is on the right side. One of them is Sari part of here. All these snaties are there, and this side have another side like um. They're called as. Not everything. This is a one. Hello? I see. Yeah I was I was up on the left hand side so I guess I know all of them did that one line but lost the first game I lost. Yeah Implement Yeah Because in the great hymn to Mahakali in the hymn to Mahakali, they say.

To me some savagery. From. That's right. So that part of all of them are on the right side it seems that in those days uh marriage. A kind of mystical dimension because through marriage they were achieving powers whereas now it looks more than it is a supporting dimension because the power will get them directly from you. Is this correct in the interpretation. I, I, I'll start again in those days, the marriage, the marriage, the kind of absolute dimension, it seemed that through marriage one was achieving a a spiritual. Higher dimension whereas now it seems that the marriage is not performing that function but just but rather to support a condition because achieving the higher spiritual dimension is done directly from from just she was a part of a dharma. It's one time. Like dharma dharma uh like that is one of the dharma supposing you marry an ex type one an ex they're not so complicated.

They didn't have ste they didn't have. All very long. Now if you have married an exile, there were only 3 types types of women in those days normally not so common. So the one child car when that side is over, then you don't get the same type then you take the second in 3 generations in 3 marriages. I had crossed all the, it was a study. Marriage was a study. What were the three types of women of what we have. Uh-huh. So you were going through these 3 types of marriage with the 3 different kind of women, and then you were not married. No, no.

Then, then you have made the study of the women at all. It was a study. It seems that it was a respectful study and the same with the wife with the husband. I think this life of, you see, changing husband is a headache. Changing wife is a headache. So the the system was made like this that you marry one wife and one husband in one lifetime to study it. It's a matter of study. I see. And then your next life another study and so on. But then by the time it is 3 marriages, you are a perfect master.

Hopefully it seems we have not learned much in this studies if you look at history. Because you are attending even when you are married. Yeah 1 back on your life. So concentrated attention. Once you accept your wife as a part of a study, sup suppose you have to get a PhD in this, you're going to do that, and you don't change your subject every day. This is the PP study that. So I mean, all right. Mr. Dila asked that she would not forget me. I hope she would think of me. She would not forget me.

She would think of me and uh he was sad and so I think I should write him a letter but he will come 2 or 3 got their realisation. The men at the entrance to, they will come to the programme. I mean if these kind of things happen in this country that would happen in India but they are Italian, but still, I mean this is a blessing that we have beautiful people even in this country, it's true. At least we allow people to be here. Well Drops also you get in English in all this Teutonic world, Germany, England. This is very true. It's a Teutonic stuff. What is Shimatay used to have a. They used to have a system of human sacrifice of the. They used to have a system of human sacrifice in this part of the world where you were drowned person alive.

So they must be theirs, you see, I mean, yeah, the thing that we had all kinds of people as you have. No, but they're so frightened of God that now if they have to also sacrifice something. And they have to do it. of God. Otherwise it could not. Basically inherently in India, the men are afraid of God. You Like they had a Kapanica. Now the Kapalica started a system by which you see, you keep a budging in the house. People like you I have no lust about her, no feelings training yourself up in such a way that you keep her. As a virgin.

And you treat her as a child if you. It's all the innocence and purity. I should close it. We never have a relationship. But if you get that kind of a feeling. Then you can He not her fault. Good, no, then you kill her so that you, you are, I mean, the thing is, same is upon you are killing the child that's you know there is a God. You see, according Indian philosophy, nobody's that that that. So then you are punished with a bow of sign up for this. That's a sin upon you.

It means you are punished. Why take that punishment. Why do they want to take this punishment? Why do they want to take this it's a weird idea they have. This is a British understatement. Yes they can do that all kinds of people this is all the right side movement. Octopus with that right. Then we had also left side movers. I think all these. But the main thing was it was all done as if they were going to achieve God like we hear the seekers.

They are going to these r thinking that they are going to achieve God. They don't go there to become devils, but there were a horrible thing happening in India, Sri horrible, but not so much as it is exaggerated. What I'm saying, it used to happen in the aboriginal areas in the jungles. They used to go hiking. Not so lastly. Few, very few. But these people would go and pick it up, you see, like the zoom lenses they'll put right. more in the 6th century because of the stuff these things. But it was so uncommon. I told you so uncommon that didn't in such a big country like that.

So what happens to all these seekers who go astray, finished. Hm I feel sad for them in a way. They have no one to guide them. Did she take that but again. Also theta which cannot blame. Anybody else but this. Is she like this man who, when that's her. We should tell people are passing through the walls. I said what did you say? He said because my money was involved.

So I said you joined the high with the film. That's a different style. Well, that is one side another one say they gave himself one day. So they probably could see that there was something wrong. Even Hester could see something wrong, but they would not trace back, you see, it's kind of like a fashion. Those all those people who take drugs, do you think they're mad people, but they are bad people, they're not, but they haven't got their own personality. Everybody's being so let us be. Right, if you were not in this, I don't know what would have happened to us. I mean, I know, I know. I know, so did you see.

you, you have a. You have fished out from the bottom of the lake. Oh, I don't think I can get anything like that. What? That's my job is when I'm different. But you, you know, it's remarkable because really if you look at a kind of sample of SAOB, I mean you really have to get them from the bottom of the lake. I mean sri the but then the sad thing is those who swim at the top of the lake don't come. They feel funny. I Yes, I feel quite funny. Like, you see, this back when he came to me first, he's a very nice man.

I think he's good, but he, he was alcoholic, he was a drug addict. He had been to the gun with a go when it came to me, they actually brought him supported by people just came outside. He couldn't see me. He just saw light things. I said, what's your name? But Hm Somebody who pinch in the nose. This wasn't. Then he got he had also this kidney stone which was removed. Everything was done his process when I told him how to do plumbing because it goes to plumbing. I say he wasn't that and he goes I mean lots of people.

After all that happened, everything then he worked in my house and he got a house, he got a wife, he would not have a child and she had a child. Everything worked out and they were very unhappy with it. I said what happened? So mother said. He was arguing with us that how much money you're going to pay for. Oh, I could not believe my ideas I said. I said, what a I can't, I said, I can't. How can I remember. But I was, I just couldn't be. I said how could you say it?

And then he went home and he said, I don't know why I behaved like this. I'm feeling bad. Really, I'm so unhappy with you so upset. So she telephoned to me saying that, what happened? My husband is so upset. What did he say? So Gavi said, I'm most allergic, and I tell you to tell your mother she'd be very. But then you see, they decided that they'll be paying to be involved this much and decided it matters. So when I went back, I said, Who was I to decide like this? You're not going, of course I'll give them some presents.

I will give them even more money than they would take, but that's it, but nobody will pay. It was surprise and then they told me that this is not bad at all. Then you see, I think I told someone I knew about it, so she telephoned to me and said that this had happened. But I said, why did you do it? I said, Mother, I don't know. I was keeping quiet. I was feeling it was so shameful to talk about these things when mother's house is being built and all that. And then this Mark fellow who was from the other from Europe, Mark, what was his name? Mark Devi. Mok.

From Brighton. He started talking about money and this and that. I don't know what happened to me. I became Buddhist and I joined. Now this mark has been always quite funny, you see, he came to work with me and I gave him money according to 20 pounds per day, you see, that's what the carpenters paid normally. And then he told Warren that I paid £40 per day. Warren told me that he's paid £40. I believed him and I gained 40 pounds. He took. The weight was only 20 pounds for an expert carpeting, but then Ci told me that the MRI just don't know how in our office.

We don't think so. I think The same mark, but that means you see. What do you say? I mean, you know, no sense of latitude, not only that, but I don't understand. What could I say when I show that he has, you don't know after that he wrote such a long letter to me, apologised, said all kinds of things. I mean, you don't know what to say. Best apology is to return the money, so the best apology is to return the money. He's doing a good job. He's working hard. It's all done, but for the driving now he's changed completely different, but when this started putting this money thing, he supported.

Actually at the same time as Mark was telling me, at the same time as Mark was putting over this story of 40 pounds a day, Pat was putting over a story of 80 pounds for himself at the same time, way back. Three months when when those jobs were done in your house, 80 pounds a day. No, but it was being discussed, Mother. No, not at that time, sorry, when the matter of your house in Shoi camps was being discussed. He was advancing the idea of 80 pounds a day from of course but he was, he was, he was quite matter of fact, he was caught up, as you say, from Marreently in this house, our house, he charged CP80 pounds so he said. I don't mind CP if you do, you got to pay all right, but not in food. But 80 pounds per day is do it for a plumber. That's what, that's what they say they get. I don't know what they get. I have no idea.

80 pounds a day is almost for age. You got what you get more than that. I would try. No, I just had to pick up the luggage in the car. Where's the luggage the luggage. No luggage is here. Your luggage is here. What is the luggage right here. Everybody's luggage is here? Yes, my children and yours, OK. What are you worried about luggage?

Do you want a handbrake? It's just I'm not. I think it's Coca-Cola also. As you The caffeine in it decaffeinated do your flight to the bathroom you go out to the bathroom and do your trousers. So should we now? What's the time? It's 10. So this is exactly the situation is that, uh. People forget and they think, you see they have a right. They have a right to get all the advantages of.

She's gonna tell you we see that every day, every day. Every day. OK, may I ask you? This uh, this is the problem. This is really good. I think they have a right. I can't help me. Yeah so. So so so so yeah. Yeah, nice solid stuff.

Thank you so much. Can you take this rice, but you don't get this other rice. This is Thailand rice. This is the one you cook today? No sugar, the cheese. Give you a better advice than that. Get it from Thailand, not from here. This one, it's, it's easily available in the shops. Is this one better than the one we had? Well, how much is how much it cost?

It's in a cheap store in Switzerland in Migro, so it must not be very expensive. Sakinasa. It wasn't what we had today. Could you spare a couple of minutes to speak to uh Guido and Alessandro and about the school. That they wanted to talk to you about the school financing. What is it? I have no idea. I know. I don't know. The.

The land is there, she says it's quite feasible. How much it is 100,000,000 more or less. So now what do you think? But I don't know, so you, I mean, if you want to buy back for you if you're borrowing money from her. And uh you own it and then you return her money gradually that's it. I don't know about I might hurt me. I. Did you return the money? I would have locked. I can give half of the money, part of the money I can give.

I don't need to give it back to me, but, uh, you see, still you should not give like that. It's not proper. what you have to put it, return it whichever way it is we can put it back for something else. I mean, nobody should use to see sort of a. So I would think about it. So now part of the money, how much is that? Mother, I still have $100,000 from the house I sold in Rome, I still have about 100,000 pounds, which partly I need for living because both my husband and I don't earn money now because so how much you need for. I don't know actually because in between travelling. And everything I've been spending quite a lot of money in this last year, but I didn't really calculate how much I spent. So it is the whole of it for that 100,000 can't reduce it a little bit.

Well, there will be also the expenses for registration of these things, so, so how much would you like to? and then how to get the rest of it? Could they give half of what I had. I or maybe a little more also. It depends the way, uh, I, I, I would like to be in peace with what is my survivor. I don't want to like that's the only thing. Then I don't know. Maybe you know better than my selfish. I would suggest this. And like I have done, I have given money to buy an Aha.

Ashton is in my name. I've given them. Then now the. Somebody responds and of course I don't need one person day today. I'm given all the money for practically all the now what they are doing is to give a rash which covers. Not only the amount of the capital, but also the interest of course it should be like that. So that is the right. Because she's getting some interest from the bank, she's getting so she should uh. I would suggest that you are getting any interest on I'm getting 10% per year 10% is how much 100,000 is $10,000 per year 10,000. So if you give her.

A 10% of interest, that's part of the money every year, which you can also, you can also supplement that little bit, a bit from here and there. So what will happen that. You can cover up. Heart expenses if you, so you should be at least prepared to pay her. Let the house be hot there, then she takes her right. One way this way. I'm taking both ways. She just takes the bed now if the house is in Jordan. Like a mortgage, like a mortgage, right, make it like a mortgage mortgage. It's like a house is a now say the house would be.

To Like an investment. Because you don't have my problem. My problem is I have to get money from CP so I can't what I like, but for you have no problem. Now what you can do is to give that money. to search by centre and they give you. The rent plus part of the money every month. So how much you can return every month in one year yourself, yourself now just practical and then we'll see how much we can return. So all that money should be passed on to you. So that money, which is the re part, which is the interest part you can use the rest of it will return back to the bank. Like there are two things that I would like to say.

First thing, we would like to put the house in your name has to be in your name. This is the only condition. Because I know. I have so many houses. Nobody is controlling it. I mean in Italy does not play any role because nobody is controlling it. I mean, who will have an overview of the things that you have in your name? Nobody. If you would have 100 properties in your name in the UK, there is some tax authorities in UK which would find it out. If it's all over the world, nobody can find it because authorities for taxes are different in each country, so it does not play any matter.

And I personally would support, first of all, it's auspicious because. I mean, first of all, it's auspicious and everybody will see better living. In your house, because the universe is your house, so let's. Let's express it. for the time being all the time you can always change it later, but we cannot put the name of the person or a company or a trust. I'm now, so now the amount you would receive from there probably. Uh, an interest. No, keep it, keep it 10% that you have to pay that's all right now the amount. That is good, but you also need that. As much as she says, she says half all right.

Minimum of keep it half of the. Now, in how many days have you done that? Baba, yes. Well, this, I don't know, we have to work it out. I mean, it depends because it's all uh. The main way is that they should, uh, these buildings are very old. They can restore it with school specification if possible, they should inquire and get a school started with outside children. All right, now I'll tell you one. You keep it behind me. Good idea, get to be my one thing.

I can be. You, you just fake. Uh And I will arrange to pay her. maybe 4 or 5 years. I In that case you will pay the house I have to pay. No, no, I'm all right if I'll get will pay what I was. Most probably because I got a bit lost. What I'm saying is that she's getting an interest of 10%. More or less I don't know. Which is any if they live anywhere they have to pay rent, so that rent will service the money that she has invested so that much she does not lose anything because she gets what she gets with the money that that money because I pay back that in 5 years.

You mean the capital. But this is not of a concern. Sri I pay her biopsy I'll pay her off that thing because I'll be able to get that. All right, so she's making an advance to the collective's already a lot of money for me we cannot drop her off, so this 100, 100, whatever she needs, I will return on my word because if it is in my name then it is mine. Thank Well, I'm not sure about this. 56 years, I will pay her back, I promise you, or at the most 7 years. But the time of 7 years. So for you it's like a long term investment and 7 years 100% because I would have given you this money myself now, but now we invested in America, so that's when I get back I can yeah no problem or we'll have some gathering money right so now that's not that. Yes, I personally, yes, I personally feel we should stop this nonsense about we don't take any money. We are taking money and we jolly well are going to take money.

We have always been. in our own speeches and lectures that we don't take any money Vibrations not for Vibrations, but we have a lot of projects are contribution is different from taking money. I apologise. What's the name of this girl, Christine. Christine, All right, you just sit down, all right, you're right, there are no other place to play, so they all right, you go and now sleep because it is 10:30 or you are. You still put them to sleep at Christen. Ah, yes, yes, yes, he's arranging breakfast and I'll go now go ahead. OK, now listen, now if you make any mistakes, he will scold your mommy. If he scold your mommy, then she's run it. So now don't make any mistakes, all right?

Otherwise he said to mommy, go see, then mommy will run away. He said, what children horrible ones, ba ba. All right, be good children. I'm telling you, otherwise all mommies will run away one after another. And, and that's I, I, I, I went so far that they could run faster indeed even he just go up is very small legs run faster, faster. You will run faster than her, he says, then I will run faster than her. Oh. When did you have what? Will you want to pick her back? You have to pick her back.

You will run faster than her to take her back, but that's the problem. But why not? Why not? hello. Then why not be good children so the mommy stays in the house and is happy with the good children. They, they can dance. It can change the the heart or she come down the bridge, but there is time for dance. There's time for singing. There's time for sleeping. Every time if you're dancing, people will say that night.

OK, now you say I must stay with your two hands, both of you now sleep and now before sleeping you pray for tai please make us very good children. Otherwise nobody will respect you. Let me think that for what? It is not respected. You have to be respectable. You follow? All right, we got this. OK, come back. OK, no you go. You can't Saint Guido preserved me.

I mean, I can dump them in Rome. He's a big blessing in my life, this one. preserve me. I thought this is what it is. I think there's if any way that money is an investment that's. That's just one questionji with this money that you get from her, what do you get? Only the money to buy it. Well, because it's going to be a lot of money. To fix the place. This is a room.

He's buying a room. Shri. So how much more you need a lot, at least a double double. Well, I don't know. No, no. But you have to, you have to ascertain we are we are doing everything we can how we did it's you have to be very careful, yes. Because what we need is just restore one place and go and live there so that we can save the rent because out of the rent we can pay the interest. That's the point. That's the main point. So we have to restore just one building and get for restoration of buildings, you see, it depends on how you work out.

It's very simple because if it is even dilapidated water first it's construction. I see construction, anybody can do. No problem. You have got that. The walls are the walls are solid. Do you have water sewage. You have water and sewage over there, yes, sewage. it's not actually. I mean, I want, I don't want, you have seen it, it is there. There is even a source of water.

There is even a source of water there source of water that's. It's a stream. What else you want? is there. You can drink. First of all, first thing 1st, 1st thing you must have electricity. You must have water. You must have levelling and construction, 4th things first hitting. That should be done for all of them to put together. Now just find out how much it would cost.

We'll supply you, no problem. We can give you supplements back. So let us know what money you need for that kind of thing. till then, you see the. She has to lend you money that much and you have to a little bit work hard to pay her. 800 in the beginning, that's all. All of you put together can do it. So many you are in Italy. You should contribute also. Italians are not getting any money, any money for scam, do you know nationwide, not a single pie has come from.

10,000 pounds. They never showed me that. That I gave some, but also others from Milan. Those who gave almost nothing, Shrima Taji are not correct me, please, are the French. No, the French were Sri that the main, the main contribution from France comes from these people here, Ruth and Kingsland, from France, absolutely 0 it was France. Absolutely. Well, Strasburg and Mayos together gave half of what France gave effectively. And this I mentioned that to Warren, you know, I think that I misunderstood, but Italians can gather money. What's all for this viness in it can be. It's I don't, I don't know, uh, because, uh, when we talk at the beginning about this project, Sandra Castelli was interested also in put some money in the investment, the money she gets now from selling the shops.

She wanted to she was interested in investment in but no investment in it all right, so I can ask her. I can ask her because I'm going to Milano. I'll ask if she's willing to give you some money, just how to provide. It's all right otherwise going to just in case we have money, no problem, no problem, but it should be done very economically. Now I will when I go to Milano, I'll arrange, so we'll have money for the pets and we will have money for the house, but double is too much. I think it's to not be more than 20,000 for all of them if you are just. 20,000 pounds for what? I think you see Italy is a very cheap place for everything. Extremely, but you must go to the cheapest. I'll tell you how to save money.

This time we had to, I told them we have to change all these boats. They said it will cost quite a lot, and any lender, I asked CP how much it charges and all that, so the prices were. The difference between this and that, we saved about 10,000 pounds. How? Because I remember it did not the supply. And from now it is about say 50 bytes or something uh we saved about 10,000 pounds, 10,000 parts, and all our boats are new now, all our boats from top to bottom. Yes. So you have to find out, see, like the shop we found out in. What we bought 10 things we would have paid for one thing in that first shop and he said it is antith and this and all those. We will manage, you know, we will manage.

What I'm saying is that you have to find the cheapest thing. Like sobertino is there. They not you know for the flooring finished. Like And uh how what do you use for uh seals? Well I think. All right. I know it's a very, a very cheap way of putting cis. I've seen it. I asked him. He said Italians can very cheap, so ask that what.

There's something he was telling me I didn't understand, but I've seen it with my own eyes. It's a very simple way of putting the ceiling, and he said you can achieve any number of floors. Yes, because we did it in that action. There was a huge rule. We cut it into two. Not that, not yours. OK, this was in a house that was your mother's eyes are very sharp, so I found it was a very different type of a ceiling. He said this is a new method they have developed in. Oh, I see, I remember, yes, remember that my eyes are very sharp, and I said no, how? And then he explained to me how they do it.

It's a very new method. It's sort of an assembled thing just pre pre precompress so we use that. He said it's very cheap, so ask him to get cheap thing now, uh, I've shown you the dose at what cheap prices we are getting. Shri on, on the basis of this, this assessment of getting all the things, you can have an exact idea of how much it would cost. On you go with budgeting, it's like you go into problems if you go on budgeting, don't budget it. Take a night what you have to do. Concentrate yourself at the time. Budgeting always gives you problems. Never do budgeting. The other way, first of all, I've told you find out about water.

Electricity. Now if you have to do water, find out how to in the water, what pumps you need, and where you store it, how to put it on the things. Find out for that, just start with it. And then find out for uh levelling if you have to level it. There's no need to level I so uh water and electricity find out and telephones, these three things are first and the roofs, the roofs, everything is there because it's a, it's a residential area. So the roof is there all selling in that area. I've seen everything there. They get cements. They get dys from the factory prices. It will be much cheaper you you work it out.

It depends on how your attention is. They'll take to another thing. They'll take to 30. Don't do budgeting. Don't do budgeting at all, don't. Never work item by item, yes, just put your attention to this thing. If you have a cheap roof, you have achieved the walls, you have achieved the water, uh, electricity, and telephones that. And ask him how they put the very cheap he was studying. I saw it. I remember Shita you told him also you ask in the car we were in the car.

Well, I think I don't know what you think about it, but I think it's good if it's done in writing this arrangement between her and whatever is Saja Yoga, this is between me and her. She doesn't. OK, then not because we have done it in writing with Marcus and Sarja Yoga Austria, and we're doing it in writing between Majas and Sarioga, Switzerland. No, it was not with you. You are not trust we have not done it all right? Now what about yours then? Uh, you, you have to return that rent. That's all. That is not to be given you right, but in the beginning, you see, when you are buying it and doing it, say, in the storing how much time it will take is the point. You have to make provision for a storing, you would have to sacrifice that that.

You won't be able to do during that time. Yeah. 800 pounds each time. Yes, I mean, nationwide we can, we can manage. I will talk to Milla we we will we are into consideration, work it out, you see, so it should be organised in such a way in different compartments. This is for the neck. This is for repairs nationally we can repairs this is the res the repairs and then the amount that is to take. We will work out. To be successful. So for the main money, you go for it.

I'll collect it anywhere or I'll give myself, don't you? I hope that the collectivity will grow in such a way that we have within 3 years. No problem. Money is never my problem, never, never. I can create money don't know, I'm quite. I, I have my own means. Yeah. Yeah This is great, Shri Ma, because this, this Rome, uh, project is, I think for, for school, I mean shooting camp is very nice for little children and and for scholarly and medicine and all that, but if you have to have a school in between, Rome is really ideal. Everybody will be anxious and also for him everybody feels for me, everybody, and I myself said many times, what are you going to feto? Nothing for my he's working and how much is he getting at.

But then if you once it starts in a regular way, then you can arrange your own finances. You must pay for yourself also. Then if it is a school, no, you, if it is a school that's why what I was saying and he is the director of the school and any director gets something. I mean, let's, let's try to to see it in this way, but. I'm unsure about one pointji. My idea was that of course it should be a should not be. That's what I, that you can pay for sayga and this was not for that if there is a school and. The director of the school and he organised the curriculum vi, the thing, everything, managing job, then there's something different. But one should not pay for giving speeches on surgery or for giving sermons. Let us send him.

That's the collection but they're in trouble now. I don't get any money. Taji a question please because you said something. Which was uh going in another direction that's what I thought, and I'm not sure I understood properly. What I felt at some point is that let's have a surgical school, find the way Melbourne does it, but even in Melbourne, they do take such children, and I think this is that you just now. OK. We will let this establish a school. We didn't start first from that we've only just started just now, just now you see, after 34 years this time, right, you see, don't run into problems to begin with, see slowly because this is what is. Yes, no, I just wanted to understand. I understood. I never put your attention onto the problem of organising.

See, basically that is the point. Yes, I, I was trying to make it, no need, no need. That's one thing wrong, absolutely. There's no money or I. Like many people about shooting camp are giving me ideas how we are going to make money. And in that to see, I'm surprised that they have misunderstood. Let me I never said that the Shri camp people have to pay me. I said if they were going to work outside in say somewhere they have to pay. They have to be paid like they go and work in Cambridge. Then they can have their earnings, but not should he can on the contrary, they should pay for their rent.

Yes, they would pay rent anyway, yes, and they should work, you see, Saturday at the doctor, so it was misunderstood in a way, you see, I think they probably didn't understand. What did he understand De Spiral? De spiral, spiral, I think. What did he understand? He understand that when the people will be coming here to shoot. Then we may charge or something, he will not show up or something that's according to what I know. Hm. This one they have to go free and should care. But this against Shrimataji, uh, if I may, this has to be clear because why may I ask, why should a doctor performing a doctor function not be paid and then why should a teacher be paid? What is the difference?

He is a teacher of a school, right? These are. Experimenting on patients with. It's not our job, you see. They are not doing jobs. They are in SUI camp. When the people come to SUi camp, they are using Sur Yoga for experimentation to get there. Do Uh-huh, they are like students in a way, no, not students, but researchers apart from that, even if they're doctors and if they are using surgeons, they cannot. If they are going to do something. In the students out of surgery.

That they cannot, they are teaching them in the classes, schools, generally they. They're not charging them for Vibrations for knowing what the Vibrations are, no, they're not charging for that. They're charging them for giving them an education for the general school. That's all big difference. And by the way, they give aga too, but that's another without any payment extra because they're not charging anything extra. What other schools charge, they charge. That's it. They don't charge extra for the, yes, and inside Yoga is extra free. Yeah, like if you have a surgeon, the carpenter. It's very important we get the concept straight because this question is going to be addressed at all levels down.

I know that. Yeah, but I'm not so much. He was saying that he was the one who put it down. No, we are not going to charge him. I think Warren knows it very clearly, you also know it to care. Nobody is going to charge for surgery. You can charge for your own work. So if let's say, which is a hypothetical, but it's for me, if Warren opened a practise in India or in Australia. And he gives messages, let's say then you can charge money. I did, I did it for one year.

Anybody who was likely to be involved in Saga, I didn't treat them as a patient anymore. No, no, apart from that, in any case, his hands will be flowing, so he will have more. It works out better. It works out better, but whatever he was charging for massaging is. And I, I felt not bad about that at all. There's something wrong they're teaching the children. They'll be teaching better to the children than others. That's all. That's their game. They're not charging extra for it.

They all go out with cool Vibrations. OK for the time being they have this school until the end of the month and then uh we can say the new situation we have to face. Either we can transform uh a little house that we have already done in the garden just a small transformation. So either we can try to arrange them, uh, I don't know about this house, continue to be here. You have to shift to that that's all, no, I mean for the school part because uh the teachers say that it will be good to have a separate building for the children. Just so you don't waste your energy on that. You just manage because if you purchase this house and all that within one year's time the. Thank much about it. Let it go as it. More I would do that with that.

It's a spoon We can do much faster put that should he get you of that. Within 3 months, I'm sure it will be ready for your. They removed everything on all. And they're doing it now with joy. They're enjoying it. At last they had nice faces and they've seen that day you came up they were much better with them. It's better and see what we need for only for taking permission it takes so much time. So he was very sweet. He went and asked that for this sentence we don't need permission. Why not we started.

As I've been told that all this land within 3 years, the value will be 4 times more, so it's a perfect investment if you're just looking at it on the financials. Did see about it. You'll be able to Do you feel confident, Ali? So there's no question it's it's a good idea. So I wish you to me, all right. All right, that's good. Such a thing should work out everywhere. Right Don't listen to people like don't listen to people like Sandra. She told me when she was absolutely bootish that he, he treats women like slaves and that none of the men have any jobs and that, you know, off her head sort of attitude. You don't borrow any money from her, Buddha, really.

She'll drive you mad. She'll drive you mad. She wanted to marry. Yeah Me, me. Oh, she's she was not that way, but said I would like a husband like we do. Vido is married daughter that the trouble, but I would like to have a husband like me. She was thinking she's the most greatest lady ever born. Everybody's willing to marry her. I would like, she was mad that time when she was talking to you first time when I said, I said, no, this mad woman, why have they put me here that house I stayed in Kilaa. This mad woman was the whole night around me.

I said every time I go there, they select one mad movement to be around my head. Like he put that marking around me. I have to tell him I will remove this martin, otherwise I'll go out. It's really. Judy. God, I can do right. You you don't. When I went to Vilao, this lady, Sandra was in the room all the time on my head. Where else, uh, I went to Hyad. There was another bad news on the.

Speaking of that. But Who was that? Oh this this for more. It's floury out of my head. I to tell about 5 years ago but I don't want. You put Chloe on No, I, I told her to go away because there was somebody on my, uh, yes, it was. I I remember that, every time I said I have to sit with now who is next to me. The thing I think you can do every day. Of course with your blessings. You can stop.

You have arranged with his house and the school. Mhm I Sometimes the Hoffman. And she makes you a full back. Mhm. She's my lucky system. She's my lucky sister now. OK, she's my lucky sister. She's lucky sister. That must be the reason she must have died because in her madness in the beginning, I would like to have a husband like we do love-hate relationship. A love hate relationship.

She loves his she respects him. That's the love, you know, she respects his goodness, but she hates him because of good when she didn't know is sweet somehow. She has a good heart with her for two days. I have never done, but she's the one. You always see that good and let it stay there. So you don't you think I fed my car. But you're making new ones all the time if, if you, I don't, I don't recommend it, but I get a bit worried because she's the one who has translated the advent in Italian translation is all right. All right, sure. I have not read it. Very well, very well.

It's been done, redone. Alessandra was there. I've been following every word and they say she did a good job. You work 2 weeks first of all about him also you have a good. Let me guess you should look at it. So Now this when Aksha Badan comes, we get scared somehow didn't even let me come to London this time. We can catch, I refuse to raki this time. I will not name who someone vaguely butish coming with a big present and a little heart. I said I'm going to tie this raki to you. I said, no, no, no, no.

I said I already have 30. I cannot have more than 30. I said a lie, but when we have to stop this raki, we always become extremists, you know. yeah. Go back and tell bad for you, yeah, we don't try, she said 60 year old people dying lucky to a little boy that you don't do like she can't understand that her husband has tied to give me who helpful to her mother, his mother, of course like a mother we'll explain to them the next time. In Saudi Arabia you have them 50 50 50 years the boy man starts at 40. He carries on till he's 70. Yeah, but uh I mean we actually when when the mountain. Why will we. I'm gonna do like.

By the meaning, Ovitawa Hotel. they will not be tying our feet, but they must be regarding each other as brother and sister. That's what I plan only because you are thinking but it's true not much time she speaks no, no, I'm. My in the in the front. I told her I have just started with them to. They don't know, but she said after all they must know what is a brother and a sister in the society. It's OK so we we will take care of. You have The of No, huh, and tell me that and I thank you. I be myself to the high one. I don't know.

You're little. Yeah I know this they are for the name. Like to see you Always say that you've never even heard on your ears, like this girl who came here and ran away. She, she was really frightened about it and then she, she, she said I built up myself into a sort of. Strange person, the one who ran around you. She couldn't understand all those things from the very beginning, and she got a shock and. I mean, one can get a shock. And at the first time when you come. You can't be. Just it's a what does she say?

They went to the beach. She was describing it to me. They all vomited, she said, we got a shock with both of us. if somebody is very old woman then she may just uh have a sari on her now she may take up, but normally even in the river people do not take bath like that. Without those, we have not seen anybody fully mute as that, but recently they took a one lady was having a bath there. Not having a sari, but I think sarri slipped and some photographers took her photograph from the west. We'll be tired, that's all they should. But in that sense, you know, nobody sees this. Yes, because at the time of Shri Krishna, the lady that left the sari on the bank, it means they were he was a child, yes, but it was done, what I mean, but people were innocent. We never felt that they show us you see that in the 6th century are away but if you can see their body and all that quite clearly there are few are not mentioned but we, we never think like that even the paintings of Michelangelo, we never think like that, you see, because that would be.

Never consider the same with uh not only the animals, but one thing I noticed whenever he said God, God is a Christ, he's always close that. I just OK. They've never shown them, right? It's completely new, they're not show and if you show some parts are just blood. Same with uh I've seen a lot we have like. Anyone is sure but the father is covered with something, mother is cover with something, the child is probably. That We have, you see, not that, of course, in such a big country that people can just get into dirty habits, but it's not a common practise, not in an accepted practise, it's not public practise. There must be some sneaky people doing these things, but on the whole it is not at all. I mean we haven't seen. I never see the prostitute all my life until I went careful.

George Never seen from. Prostitute for down here. Livia maybe not. That is, what is it? That's it. No. Maybe she that I not see it. Because if he was sick early he was uh. Uh, and we had our house was occupied, so we were staying in the circuit house. And in the house.

I was there with him, and the office was also there in the separate houses. So why don't need to get. Weco test and food and all that. And she saw me, so she turned around and came in the house, and she said, can I speak to you for 5 minutes? I said, Yes. And she said, see, this house I have, they want me to oust me from there. They don't want to keep me there. I'm in great difficulties. What am I to do? I said why?

She said, I'm with the wife. And the wife you don't need a pro. so I you With the See, I sell my body that sell your body. I start to do here. Yeah. I said still whatever you said doesn't matter. Why should they throw you out of the house. Yes. And see he came and he shouted, I want to bring inside my house. Get out.

Go in the office. I said you'll talk something to the lady. He said, What a lady does, this lady, she'll talk like that. She, why why are you giving up? He said she just said the wife. I said, you know what is the wife is? I said, I don't a prostitute for her. She was so nice, sweet and she didn't have any catches. So she doesn't have any cancer. Oh, she doesn't have any cancers.

I said she doesn't have any cancer. I know, she was a musician. She might be just a sing. She may not be a practitioner, practitioner, but she might be just a singles. There are, we have prostitutes who just sing. They don't practise prostitution. Well, I mean, this is a rather strange extension of the of the of the word because but. In the way the controversial. It depends on what is illicit. To sit with a woman who's not your wife is considered wrong.

Some, some men they just like to sit Shrimaji in in India to sit with any woman who is not your wife, say, or something like that to listen to her music might be considered wrong. much so that in that way he's getting illicit pleasure from listening and sitting and listening to music he pays. That's what. Many musicians or or there are two doctors. Uh, prostitutes. But they have beautiful voices, so they are trained as musicians, and they live like musicians like Kirabo they got main musicians here. This was the one we were, uh, hearing the other day. What was her name. You again. Oh wait hold on just one.

Oh I like her very much. She's the daughter of uh Bay. And uh. I mean all of them, this, uh, Nangka who you heard you like her voice like the girl she sees. On the reports. You know, like her voices very much. She's the one who can say the prostitute, she's a prostitute or a daughter of prostitute. She's a prostitute. Her sisters are prostitutes in the sense that mothers are prostitutes. They come from prostitutes family.

Is Lata Mangeshka born realised. Permanent Let's get our act together, please. Many of them are prostitutes, you see, but the thing is they're only musicians. That's why, like, uh, Abdul Karim has I married a prostitute. Married her and she had these daughters from here Sasuani he would to be her and uh the one who was going to. My name is uh Elder sister, she went to Pakistan, so 3 of them are his daughters from. I mean, it's an evolution that he married the first. But how they can sing Bagavagita, how they can sing Bagavagita. No, they are not prostitutes at first. They're not practising pros.

They are musicians from prostitutes' families, so they call them, they are prostitutes when no one marries them like that, they sing music. But they did like what my chri? I don't know that part. It's sort of like a cast, using the the the the name prostitute as a cast. The cost. So many, I think I know so many of them are like that. This is another one I think. Whose music do you like, uh, in the little side? Indian music in the other one, classical music. Which cigar?

I don't know Most of them are. Prostitute clots, most of that. Even this Vena Kumari is a prostitute, actress Vena Kumari. She was the daughter of a prostitute. And both two doctors, one of us. What about dances you want? Dancing maybe we had named dancing, you know, they were prostitutes, dancers and prostitutes, and we had also not dancing and also very sophisticated and also not very many, many musicians are like my sister is from a good family. Now it seems that, but you see there are people with good voices, they were not prohibited from singing. They took to see you and they were the daughters of prostitutes, so they were real pro I mean that cast become a prostitute daughter is a prostitute. But then they marry us and married you remember a fellow who sang before us this, uh, uh, musician, yes, yes, I remember him, the one who was very good cut cut cutting.

How do you name me? The one who took off his watch and the one who played the tabla. He's the son of a prostitute. Yes, I remember he, his father was a Parsi banker Parsi. The Parsi had a prostitute guy and then. This is a son from Parsi are lots of prostitutes as kids, but they are one of the. Main sustain us. Not in my family. I very much because there are many people Parsi Marwadi, Gujarati and Javalolier. Maybe he's a Gujarati banker.

A banker looks like a banker. His name is banker. Right, what was it? So it is not regarded as. Uh, something, I mean they. I in the house now in our house used to get them to sing music and whatever, but after we that first. No social problem, but according to to this criteria of cars, we could say that in the west there are perhaps. 80% of the women were prostitute. 5% who are nuns and 15% who defined. constitutional, yeah.

Maybe. Well, by definition. We all take money to do. No, they don't take money, they don't take money, but I mean. But I think in the United States, the, the statistics, this is the blessings of 8, the statistics of virginity are going up again, yes, and the frequency uh of, of, of contacts is less, and the age of the first contacts is again going up. It's a very recent trend. There's no problem. But the country which the continent which may be completely destroyed by its Shrimataji is Africa. It's in Africa that the problem is worse because in some tremendous promiscuity in Africa and certain places an extremely high proportion of the population is infected and it is hetero, it's not hormone. And it's very easy for primitive to follow your culture and to follow our culture.

True, you take your culture just like this as fish takes to work. But AIDS in Africa, Shimai is not such a dangerous disease. It's not such a dangerous disease in Africa, or not, I don't know, the virus seems to be different. They don't die so much, but in the states, the death rate now is 2/3. Of those who get infected. The disease is the thing if it is a cultural disease, you see, then it depends on where are you, you see, that's the point. It's a cultural disease. This is due to the culture that is wrong in these countries, drugs, these are all cultural disease. And they will easily penetrate into Africa because they are primitive people and like the over one primitive meet at a point like that. Still these are going because they go the whole night or how many are passing I had one.

I think that it's about the last one they try to discourage people using cars, but they're never full apart from in the rush hour, you know, Mother, you know why Ruth and Kingsley took this flat because he's an old bus. I know he had to watch his buses. It's not a bus. It's not a bus. It's it's it's a, it's a no, no, it's it's actually, um, what's the word, an articulated bus. It's, it's a bus with a trailer and sort of bellows in the middle. Yeah, so it goes around the corner to go around corners not a trolley bus. No, no, not up here. No, no, not a diesel bus the way it is you see regularly every 10 minutes you find one. During the day it's every 5 minutes or 6 minutes.

And then as well you've got the the ones coming in from outside the town. This is the end for the town buses, but there's even more ones coming in the post busting. I mean, if you sit down, if you sit down, you can write it down, but they're empty. That's the worst part. This is to discourage the water. Because they're not cheap, I mean, they they the fares aren't cheap. But the the the the trains are. Have a record deficit of 600 million Swiss. The whole public transport system is bankrupt. Actually, if you go like this, why?

Yes, because it, because everybody has a car. They should stop it. Why are they wasting money? I'm collecting from you all the, all the taxation and making all your things so expensive. There there's no wisdom about that. Once it has started, was. Probably there's a bus company manufacturer justify themselves. They go into the machine and they want to justify they have been put themselves in the machine. There is no flexibility that's true. I have said now that machines are for us.

We are not for the machine. If this is like, we are for the machine whether you go or not, it will go on. It's such a waste to me, you see, that is what is hurting me all the time. I see an empty person. They have very little unemployment here, you see Shri Matai, but in a supermarket there's a person who's employed to move the trolleys, the shopping trolleys around, and then there's a person who's employed to vacuum clean the streets or to wash the streets while it's. or to vacuum clean the car park underneath the building where the where the concrete shines where you could eat your dinner off the concrete. So who does that? Well, these people that aren't unemployed, you see, like every other country people are unemployed here. Everyone has something to do, even if it's running a bus every 5 minutes. Let them go and cut some of the trees.

You have too many of them. They're dying they are dying that's automatically. If you have too much like in our country, too much population, people are dying automatically. If you take this is fine. So many trees you have unnecessary. There are so many countries with the job, but you find it there. But here wood is so expensive. Do you have to take a permit here to cut a tree down? Of course, yeah. I'm of course I'm joking.

If I go to the forest and I cut a tree, I get arrested. I go to the of course I thought that was laughing. He said, Mother, have you noticed how crazy they are about the trees? I said, I know it's terrible. He said, even if a tree becomes so small in huge tree becomes so small in the heart, they start worrying about just worry more about the trees than about human beings. Yes. Why am I so addicted? and gnomes used to live in the forest in trees, trees on the tree. But all of them are like that, even in England they're very curated. They were also Teutonic people you were saying earlier.

Oh God. But there is something which is called the Schwarz valve. I mean, actually there are very sinister Vibrations in those forests. The boots are there in the trees. That's why I don't like them. So what is that. You must allow sunshine to come on this earth. If you remove these your boots will go away also not not. Mhm. We should buy, we're we're going to make it we're going to make a special oven with a lot of the branch that's I think.

Ashimai, if a tree's branches touch the earth, it becomes botified. If a tree's branches come right to the earth. You know it's not trimmed then they become boot. And then what will happen? They have boots in them in my garden I remember they were boots right there. I wish I I wish I boot a tree is not very good thing. I mean they're all right, but they should be cut. They should not be so many. There no trees are not good. Little bit is all right.

In India there are individual trees which are worshipped, but there are individual trees, they're not forests, that's the difference. We have forests also forests we have for, uh, not human beings, but for for us, you see, for the animals. Not for human beings, but here you live in forest human beings. But they're different trees, Shri Mai, they're broadleaf trees where the light can come through. Here they are these fir trees that where where where all you get is is the tree at the top, it's a mass of foliage and a bare trunk and nothing can grow under it. If you have a forest, I mean, in England, although they're planting a lot of these horrible spruce trees now, but if you have oak trees and and and larches and all these different, OK, I like to find some space. Yes, yes, these are individual trees. It's like in India Shri Mai there the tree is the father of life because it protects from the sun, but he's alone, so he's a focus of social life. People gather under it, but it's very auspicious, but we don't have this kind of majestic tree. We just have one and I remember roads by trees everywhere, but it's difficult in this where everything is just the same going like you see it's like uh.

Patch on the bald head of a person you see from the top of. There you go there there's nothing special, but like we have very nice trees also bunny and trees are there. Uh We have planted some in my di. And then we go to just to cut any any plant, just put it in your place. India is such a great country. What will happen in India to all these horrible cities? What will happen in India to all these horrible cities, for instance Kolhapur, Bombay? Such horrible concrete buildings everywhere now. What will happen to all this? Some, some, some will be coming up.

Uh, the people as you are, the people are. Do you have any concrete minded? Nowadays, I mean, those who are educated are very concrete minded. It's such a shame because there is, I mean, with due respect, there is not one Indian city which is nice in that respect. Everything it is, they used to be beautiful, but it's no no there is dirty but but yeah Jaipur are very lovely. Uh, the area. What's wrong with Pulaa is all right. It's quite interesting, yeah, where, where my land is when my land is very good. But one thing is that our CTs are all different, different types. It's not just the same like you see if you go to say Yorkshire, then you go to Staffordshire.

You don't know the difference. It's the same which part part are you go Yorkshire. At least in England there is still some, but in America, even the cities are horrible. This is sinister. You can't one from another. You can't just the same throughout England is now very much, but there is some still character by the same kind, but some places are you can't make out where you are. Just the same, go on terrace house terrace houses from here to there, there to there, and that houses go on like that. But your cities are just the same. How if they are on the key, you can't take out which is which. You should see something in the morning, you see the same thing in the evening, you think it's another city.

Because that's all, but otherwise there is no change. If you see the CT in the daytime you think they are all just the same. There's no character talking of you. Thank God you have a lake and there's a spouse coming in Geneva. Otherwise you won't even make out that it's a Geneva. If you come in winter, you will not have the jets, no it's too expensive. Oh De is expensive. I mean, I don't know, but it is, I don't know what to it becomes. No, they, they cut it. It only goes uh between uh April and uh till October.

Then in winter and uh the beginning of spring, they cut it. When the gnomes are sleeping, they don't entertain them. Right. But don't remember too much. So Matai, I remember even that 3 years ago when we were driving through Geneva area you were mentioning that we had too many trees and from that moment I noticed that you can go in complete areas in. At midday and you drive in your cars, you don't have a ray of sun because it's completely covered by the trees. Hamid was telling me they are so crazy. He was laughing. They're more worried about the trees and the the hair of their beard. But mildheadedness.

Right, so planting my hair is serving so many trees like this. No one must have a like not should not be like ours. It's barren, but we are paying special amount for uh uh to have trees and all that, but not this kind of a jungle, it's too much. General should be a jungle, all right. Why you have around your people? Same in America people. Go to upstate New York. You don't know if you are going in a jungle or you are going in a storm. So much, so it's not good. Boots I think will run away.

Viruses will run away. So many diseases will go away if you remove some of your. Somebody must put up with a PhD. Yeah, I think things will improve and I tell you why, because it has lots of salt, you see, that's why Italians are healthier people. And. And of course the rainfall patterns get changed completely. Rainfall, yes, so much of rain is because of that. not for the tree. Yes, not for lonely. Very little is known.

I learned that at school, but you know, most of these people don't even know that they don't know. And But I just don't know this about education, I don't know. It is like yes, no, yes, no, yes or no, that's all. But I thought everybody knows that, but you're talking to an Englishman and now we're in Switzerland and it's not. That's right. It's a well known fact. It's a fact, it's a it's an HST, you know. What happens from the soil. The water is sucked by the sun. So the suction starts.

And the water goes up and it sucking more by the sun, it forms lows. Those clots, clouds are the uh catalysts because of that, the vein is pulled out, you. All the water from the soil goes up. Especially your trees, the Sulu and all these trees that they have, it breathes oxygen and water out of the trees. They, they, if you put them near a river, the liver will dry. They're like just syphons, you see, sucking all the water from your livers and everything, and they push it up with all your snow and everything, see sucked in and goes into. And that falls as. It is not the rain of any monsoons or anything coming to you. I mean, it is not coming from the sea. It is coming from your own mother.

Mother earth goes there and he becomes rain and comes to you, goes back again again that goes back and comes to you. It's a nature cycle. And it's the other way around in India. I don't get monsoons here or the 40s here. In England so we could do it because of. Yeah, I don't know this simple because I'm surprised. Now the rain is less in London, have you noticed it much less than what it was. About 10 years back, much less. If you see the statistics, because not many trees have been some are cut. Is it raining a lot in Brighton?

Well, it used to rain a fair bit, yeah, near Brighton there is no tree at all, but not yet, but they've got a special thing with the downs. You've got the hills just before. I wouldn't say it rained a lot. I mean it probably rains more here. I should like, I see. And in England, uh, the thing is it used to snow a lot in England. London used to be snowbound. How does the once in a while. Some of that has to do also with the fact that they cut the pollution down a lot in London, that some of it has to do with the fact that the pollution has been cut from factory chimneys and this kind of thing that pollution you had in any used to get smokes. Which you had all the pollution because of you had kidneys and all that, so you had lots of pollution over there.

It is not that season. The reason is you have no trees now, much less trees. Please cool down the temperature. You see the succulent, that suction gives you that what we call the latent heat, you see, it sucking and because of latent heat, the temperature comes up. But, but then she Mataji, it's a blessing, the acid rain or the dying forest because it's all happening in the north and so there will be less woods and less. The balance of nature coming because no one knows the exact cause of this. It's it's a virus. It's not that forests actually who suffer but now experimenting and he said that things which are beyond 60 years, they don't react to a so but which are 25 years or 10 years, they are coming up. So I still they go there will be a lot of sunshine. But the others will die with the others but some must die also.

They continue more than human beings to see these. And in India there should be more tree I should rather now. Isn't it funny how an education system suppresses certain things which are not only basic, but somehow or other, um. Yes, daily life, but what I'm getting at is in a country like England, which should be. Corrected The very thing that we correct is missing from the education. So you can Surprising, you see, like here people. Sleep without any clothes and it's the best way to get. Very close veins or anything, arthritis or that I'll say arthritis very close vein so. I mean one day if you sleep without clothes, if you didn't want to go to the hospital because they said that you will have to wear our clothes nothing we told them I'm going to wear my own clothes and I'll wear as much as I want, otherwise I'm not. You can't sleep without a sweater.

All these are very bad things for health. I mean, it's like a complete ignorance about life and now sleeping new can can you call a doctor. I it comes from adi too much and they couldn't afford any fluid. I just. What year? There is a bed here or. But this is all Mataji. They always had clothes. My grandparents, my grandparents were suddenly buttoned up to the neck. Shri Mataji.

Then what? This is, this is the post World War II fashion. It's not in England. It's, it's an old habit of sleeping an old habit of Victoria I'm sure Victoria is just one generation away from flannel and gold. This is Australian skin. They used to wear vests on the floor and the pyjamas. But when did this start? it's. We know that Henry the 8th and that you didn't register. Did you register?

He said, I've also heard you could sleep without clothes. I don't think this is the kind of thing which she has heard it. I don't know when it stops. I'll let you know how do you I have no idea how it is done, so maybe copy it. Mhm. Absurd the experimentation or they never used to be and I forced them. I said, What is this nonsense? Did you get breast cancer. They used to burn, they used to burn them. Oh, the bras isn't that true, Gregor to burn their support for to get breast cancer.

What is this Shi Mai, there were some women who didn't want to be women, you see. There were women. They didn't want to be women. They want to look like men. So they need. What do you mean used to be the problem with that, she, she was looking really she was trying to understand if you say somebody, a woman, your mother needs to look like a man, then she absolutely she will hate you. There was, I was sitting in the hotel this morning, and there's this person coming down, so I thought it was a man, you see, so I said hello, and I realised it actually was a woman that is a very common. with. we can't tell apart, but the problem is shemata in 20 years' time. What I explained to the widow, all these people will be completely filled and jammed in the hospital and psychiatrist and so on, and it will be 10% of active people who have to pay for the 60% of the population which is mad.

This is this is we have to go for this crazy we pay for the mad people to come to the road and to and to and to drive their empty buses. That's why we, we, they are now they are jammed. They are absolutely they don't know where to put them, the madman, yes, so they are going to put on the yeah, that's what they do they're releasing started when there are children, I don't know whether you know this one, when there are movies for children. See, I have to tell you, we went to see a children, which was, no, uh, a movie which was for children. Thenly I turned I turned, looked behind me. I was with Arno and Mary Martin was another, and I saw about 30 of these completely mad people, but you know, really mad, you know, you know, this kind of thing really. Like that, they go in the movie. So I said, I said, oh, I mean this is really terrible, and then I said, OK, we are going to, now we are going to be brave, we are going to stay here. The like I look before me, and there were 5 of them, she was, if I may just uh show with my face, there was one like that before it was like. Like just did for me.

I said, no, I can't stay here. I just, oh, this was movies for children, there were 40 absolutely crazy 40 at least they were all together they were 40. They were a big group of you but they're like children. But it happened in the tra the tram every morning to work. That's only one person came. doesn't. Oh, how are you? Hello, I know you. I'm so glad to meet you. You are completely mad and I said, Oh, I'm fine, thank you to see where I could.

Yeah. When we make last. I come with blind eyes, but they have too many, probably maybe the highest per capita we were we were shocked with when we arrived here in Bern, we never saw such a high proportion of mad and handicapped and completely bodily people like they go in the little wheels there are tonnes of them. What didn't happen. I don't know why this happens.
