Seeking and rationality, London (UK), 24 May 1979.

summary: 
In our searching, we are asking for the actual experience. In all the scriptures it has been said that we will be born again. We are looking for a second birth which is within us. All the religions talk about it. We have to stabilise ourselves to get the experience and it will work out. We search with our minds and rationality for the truth. This mind is not connected to the whole. We are not aware of the whole, we have so many problems. Thinking, unenlightened rationalisation and awareness are different. Rationality has all the time been living with the ego.

We can't separate the ego and rationality - neither are perfected nor mature. If we are mature enough to know why there are vibrations in the molecules - through rationality we cannot discover this. We cannot give answers to questions - e.g. Why are we human beings? We take too much for granted. If we try to rationalise everything we'll go mad. Our rationality is not mature enough, it is not enlightened. The "I" within us knows the rationality, but rationality doesn't know the "I". We can't know each other's point of view. Why human beings are made out of an amoeba - through rationalising and logic?

The process has been worked out without any effort required. We breathe, our heart works, etc. without our doing anything. Therefore everything has to come spontaneously, like the sprouting of a seed. Only human beings believe in God, not animals. We haven't our fulfilment. People are seeking. The awareness is responsible for the seeking. We have to keep our rationality clear. I ask you not to believe me, but not to deny me because you can't rationalise.

Now is the time of blossoming and many are going to be converted and have fulfilment. Our instrument, existing on many different levels has started to become enlightened. We pass from gross to the subtle of Mother Earth. Subtle Mother Earth is fragrance. The cause of Mother Earth is the axis. Ultimately we go to the primordial cause, which is the spirit - the reflection of the God Almighty.

The real Gurus working in the forests and the great people like Moses and Abraham knew how difficult it was to raise Kundalini. When people are authorised it is an easy thing to do for others. When it moves up the centre and pierces the fontanel bone, we achieve self realisation. We aren't even aware of what has happened to us, what we have achieved. It's so spontaneous and so simple but it's a very dynamic process, an all dimensional working, which makes the Kundalini rise.

I am a simple housewife who has this unique technique, I am your teacher and can get us broken into the Unconscious. You mustn't be upset because of my simplicity. Jesus Christ was a carpenter's son. His Mother was an uneducated woman. Krishna was a cow boy. When we find something like this, it is a beginning. Having been able to get our own power risen is enlightening our rationality. It is simple love. Mother can't keep all her love to herself. Christ was crucified for us to have it and to understand what we have; understand the mechanism, master it and we can give light to thousands. To help them mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. Not to waste this wonderful gift. Our rationality will see the power flowing through us and we will enjoy the bliss and joy of this wonderful happening.

May God Bless You !
