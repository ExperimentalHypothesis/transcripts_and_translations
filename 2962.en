[Part 1]

Every time we have some people who are new and I have to come with the introduction of the subject because after all, it’s the subject of the Absolute Knowledge. And, if I suddenly start-off, then, it will be difficult for you to follow it.

Though, through rationality, you cannot understand it, it is not a subject which can be discussed or if you think by discussing and talking about it, you will reach somewhere then you are suddenly mistaken. That’s how people have been doing it, all the time, they have been talking, talking, talking, talking. And, this talking has led you nowhere. For example, one can give a big sermon, as how you should be or how I should be. And may go on and on like that from generations to generations.

And, people in search of Truth, do take to it easily, because they are searching. Whatever they get, they say, “all right. let’s have it”. And, there has been curricular force which has been guiding them throughout in their search, of which they may not be aware of. And, that’s why, they have been denying one after another all such people, all such organizations, which have not been able to give you the actualization of the Experience. And that is what it is, one has to ask for.

Now, it has been said in all the scriptures that you are to be twice born. Now, what is that? It has been said that you have to know yourself [your Self]. The rest of it, has no meaning. Now, if they have said it, either, they were wrong, they were fraudulent, or they were genuinely correct.

So, we come to a point, where we have to see whether, really such a thing like, second birth happens or not? Does it happen? Or it is just a myth, people are talking about? Are we looking out for something that is mythical or really there is something like second birth within us?

There is no religion, no religion I’m saying, which has not talked of your second birth. But, how to achieve it, how to get it? All of them have said, that you maintain your sustenance, you maintain your equilibrium. I am not talking about the organizations that we have built up, all these so called religious faiths that they have. I am talking in the essence of every religion that we have to just stabilize ourselves and wait and it will work out.

So, all these promises were given to us by people who are still, till today, are respected, and are called as they say, “Son of God” or “incarnation”, with such great names. They could not have told all us a lie.

All right, then, we go out for searching the Truth. We go out with our mind, our rationality in the modern times especially. We depend on our rationality. We go on moving in this direction in every enterprise, every enterprise we move into, is through our mind. And, if you see it closely and clearly, you will find that this mind moves in a linear line, it does not behave like a living thing, like a living organism, which moves in all directions, in proportion to others, in proportion to the Whole.

So, our mind is not connected with the Whole. If it was, you would not have all the problems like you have affluence money, you have pollution. Everything, that you do, ends up into a downward curve, because you have to face many problems.

So, this mind is not the instrument that gives you the awareness of the Whole. May be, because of certain past experiences, you may be aware of, or not I would not say aware, but that you can think about the common problems, the common difficulties, but still, you are not aware of the Whole. So, there is a difference between thinking and awareness. Awareness is that, we are aware that there is light, we are aware that there is sun, still, in the sky. We are not thinking about it. But we are aware.

But I am not talking of Awareness, I am talking of Actualization, of Enlightenment.

So, we move from one stage, where we think, rationalize, then we move to another stage, where we are aware. And, the third stage, where we are enlightened. At least, minimum three stages. With this rationality of ours which is limited, we can.think off.

Rationality has had all the times, since we are being human beings for ages now, living with your ego. It is so much connected, it has been so much in association with your ego, ego. And, that there has been a lot of rapport between your rationality and your ego.

You cannot separate both of them. So, there is also a muddle about it, whether you are thinking through your ego or you are thinking through your rationality? Is it pure rationality or your Ego is on top of your rationality?

Now, when there is such a muddle within our minds, how can we say that, we believe in rationality of everything, when your Rationality itself is not established?

Now, if we take to our rationality, how far are we developed in our rationality? Let us see. Of course, it is not perfect, this you know, this you will have to admit. If we leave our ego little bit on one side, that whatever we try to rationalize, we do not reach the perfect conclusions. All kinds of problems, you start with democracy, you start with communism, you start with any enterprise, you do, you get into troubles.

That means your rationality is not yet perfected. What is the disease of your rationality, is your ego to begin with. And the second is immaturity of your rationality. Because, if you are matured enough, you should be able to tell through your rationality, why there is gravity, why there are vibrations in the molecules, say of Sulphur Dioxide. The Sulphur and Oxygen, both are vibrating all the time, all the time, with a particular frequency. Why? You cannot answer even one “why” through your rationality. So, where is the rationality?

Still, you take everything for granted. Whatever is discovered, is not through your rationality, it is dawned upon you. And, your rationality has accepted. It’s a different point. But you cannot give “Why” of anything. If you accept this, I can tell you, our ego can little bit go down.

Then, you start separating between the two, very easily when we will realise that we cannot give answers to any “Why”, whatsoever. Why are you made a human being? Simple question. We take it for granted, “Oh, we are human being”. But, why are you a human being? Why from amoeba, you are made a human being? When you cannot answer these questions, then we take it for granted.

Is a good thing. In a way, it’s a good thing to take certain things for granted. But, if you try to rationalize everything, you will go mad because your rationality is not that much developed, is not mature, is not yet enlightened.

But, through rationality, you realize something. You realise something that certain things you have to understand beyond rationality. Certain things, you cannot rationalize. You do it, every day-to-day talk, you do it, “I do not know”. If you were perfectly rationalized, you should know everything.

But, it’s a common thing, we say to people, “I do not know”. And, people do not mind. If this answer is given, we say, “All right, he does not know”. So, finished.

That means, one does not know that “I” is not known to you, to your rationality. If it is known to your rationality, then you are an Enlightened person.

Like, you are a human being, alright, and you have a human awareness. So, you know up to a point. That is, supposing, you know this window, alright. I will say, “I know this window”. But I am not that window. Because I know it, it is “I” who has to know the window. So, I am different otherwise, if I am not separated from the window, how will I know the window? Then, I say, “I know my body”, alright, that means I am not this body. Even people say, “I know my mind”, so that means you are not even your mind, that means you know not your rationality.

So, you come to a point, where you realize, that there is something like this Mr. “I” within we, which knows everything, but this rationality does not know that “I”.

So, we come to a point, where we realize, that there is something lacking, that a connection between “I” and rationality, is not yet established. Could be. But there is an ignorance, that if we accept, then it’s easy to go further with this limited rationality that we have got. But first, let us accept that this rationality cannot know that “I”. “So, then what do you do with this?”

Suppose, you want to fly. I am talking of flying into the space of the Eternal Love of God. Don’t believe me, but say, I am talking about it. Now, if you have a car, which can only move in a one line, you cannot fly. So, you have to develop an aeroplane out of that car of yours.

Unless and until, you have your rationality enlightened, you cannot go further, which shows that human awareness, which have given us this rationality, which is not absolute, because everybody has a different type of an approach and attitude. If it was not so, we would have been all the same, no problems, no wars, nothing, no questions, no quarrelling. But, here, two people cannot live without quarrelling. This is the condition.

With the rationality, the way we are, we cannot see each other’s point of view for a long time. So, what do we do? How do we solve this problem? So, let us see, go back to our old question, why a human being has been made out of amoeba? How do we solve this problem? How do we answer this question? That, we have become human beings from amoeba stage. is a fact. But how have we become?

Let’s go with our rationality on this subject, it’s very interesting.

Now, there must be some logic about it. You see, because rationality also give you the side effects of it. First of them is that there is, must be some logic in becoming a human being from amoeba. And the way it has moved. Nobody has put in any efforts; you have not put in any efforts. And you are a beautiful human being.

So, what efforts will be needed to become that higher being, if it has to be something like an Enlightened rationality that I am talking of? No efforts, should be required if we logically see that, from amoeba to this stage, for years together, the whole process has been worked out within putting any effort by the person who is transformed.

So, no effort is required for a person who wants to be transformed. That is one thing very simple. I tell you, all lazy people should say, “Oh God, thank”. But there is some place where you get something without doing work. But that’s rather difficult to accept this proposition. That, you can get it without doing any work, whatsoever. But, do we know that we have already got so many things without doing any effort? Like, you are breathing just now normally. You are digesting your food, listening to me, you are seeing me. And, all your body is working out. Your heart is pumping the blood. Everything is happening without you doing anything about it.

When we see this, then we realize that if it the most important thing that has to happen, then it has to happen spontaneously, like a living process of sprouting of a seed. Now, sprouting of a seed, how can you rationalize? Again, we come back to rationality because, I know, this a very common topic.

How do you rationalize a sprouting of a seed? How does it sprout? See the incapability of this rationality, that It cannot transform one flower, one flower into a fruit. Then, how can you understand God or anything divine with thinking? You can’t.

The One who is doing these things, thousands of these things, millions and billions of these things, how can you understand that Personality? If it so through your rationality, you cannot do it.

So, the best thing people do, is to negate, negate. Then we cannot understand what to do, just negate God.

But only the human beings have believed in God, why? Not the animals? We have ourselves discovered God or believed into some people who have talked about God and that we say, “There is God”.

Now you negate God, now what is the ultimate? What you get out of it by negating? What do we get out of all our rational enterprises? What have you got? Are we happy people? Have we found out our meanings? Have we got our fulfilment? We haven’t got it. Let us accept it.

So, something has to happen and we are looking forward to it. That’s why we say, that people are seeking. We are looking forward to it in a very unconscious way. It is all the time in our mind. But there is something, will happen in us. Something, that connection which has not clicked so far. We are aware of it. And, this awareness is responsible for the seeking of the people.

Now, the second point of it, would be easier to understand, that whatever I am telling you about, you may not just now, know about it. And also, you may find it rather difficult to believe into it.

I am not saying that you should take it for granted, not at all. But you have to keep yourself open, as if to a hypothesis.

Now, have you got something within us, an instrument, by which we get that enlightenment in our rationality? Is there any width, that gets enlightened within us, by which our rationality feels enlightened. I would say, “Yes there is”. Now, you need not accept.

In all the scriptures, it has been described. In the Bible, it is described that I will appear before you like tongues of flames.

I would say, anyone of these people who are talking of Christianity, let them explain what it is. They cannot. Because they have not yet actualized the second birth.

Anyone, who is following Islam, if they could say, what is to be a “Peer” and how it happens, I would really accept them, as realised souls. Or, even if they could explain the symbolic expression of the Namaz [unclear, as it’s ?]. They are just doing it, because it is told. What is the significance of this Namaz? What is the advantage of this Namaz? What part of your being is enlightened by this Namaz? They do not know.

In the same way, any Hindu, if he could explain to me, the symbolic meaning of the mantras like, “Aim Reem Kleem”, what does this mean? Any of these mantras? What are mantras? What do they achieve? Then, I would accept it. But they are just doing it, because it has been plotted out for them. They are going the straight forward march on the line, that is made.

Though, I would say, in religion, we have to be rational, but which way? When we come to religion either, we accept it, absolutely without rationality, or we negate it, out of rationality.

To accept anything, without rationality, is also not sensible, not to negate it absolutely, because your rationality is also not wise. You have to see. Keep your rationality alert. And to see, actually, if such a happening, then take place within you. And, if I say that “yes”. This will happen to all of you, has to happen. The time has come. The blossom time has come. And, many are going to be converted into their fruits. They will have their fulfilment. I mean it. But, as I again requested you not to believe me, what I am saying. But, not to deny me also, because you cannot rationalize.

It’s a happening. it’s a living happening and that happening takes place, because, we have an instrument. Now, instrument, what we understand, is a dead thing. But if you understand the word primule (gemmule). If you understand the sprouting, germinating part of the seed we have within us, a germinating part which connects with the mains, we have got it.

Now, there is a complete mechanism, built within us, in the course of our evolution, and these subtle centres are placed within us. They all exist at different levels. First, in a medulla oblongata, then in the brain and here [unclear].

This is the instrument, which you see, such a beautiful picture. That is within us, kept already, to be started, to be ignited. And the cord, that is going to connect us to the mains, is there coiled up into the 3 and 1/2 coils.

When this rises upwards, then you pass through various levels of awareness. First, from the gross, the gross is you see the fruit. We see the mother earth, let us take the mother earth. From gross to subtle, what is the subtle of mother earth? Is fragrance. We pass to the subtle, then we pass to the cause of it. Into the cause, what is the cause of mother earth? The cause of mother earth is the axis it has. We have got our axis and in the same way, when we go to the cause of our being, we go to that axis. We are attracted towards that axis. That is, what is the central part. And, ultimately, we go to the primordial cause. And, what is the primordial cause that is placed within us, is the Spirit. Is the Spirit, which is the reflection of God Almighty.

It’s a tremendous thing. It’s a very, very deep thing. And, when it is worked out with effort, many Gurus, and very real ones, I am saying, I am not talking of the horrible ones, but the real ones, who have been working in the forests and the Great people like Moses, Abraham, all these people, they knew how difficult it was to raise the Kundalini, this coiled thing, gradually, one after another. And, the detailed description of this, is so horrified, that people get a fright.

Actually, when Kundalini rises, normally, by effort of people, who are authorized to do it, is such a slow movement, that, at any centre, where there is any escape, any weakness, the attention immediately goes on the side, from the cause, from the centre.

Once, it moves to the centre, you start getting all kinds of visions. This is for our Sahaja Yogis, this part is. That, every time, you get your introduction in different ways, but so. And, these are different levels at which you start rising in your awareness. And, the whole rising of the Kundalini up to the fontanel bone and piercing of that, in itself is such a dynamic process. That, we are not even aware, what has happened to us.

Absolutely, we are not aware what it has achieved. Of course, when I will be on Monday, in the ashram, I will give you all the details about it. But just now, for the new people also, I would like to say, though, it is so spontaneous, it is so simple. But, it is a very dynamic thing.

It’s a all-dimensional working, which makes the Kundalini rise. But it has happened now. You should not be very shocking to see, a simple housewife, who has found out this method. I mean, that should not really jar you too much that, I am just a very, very simple housewife. That should not upset you very much too.

That, if I have found out a method, say, for example, by which one can get an ‘en masse’ actualization of breaking through into the unconscious, one should not, I feel, be upset. May be, sometimes, very simple, useless people, find something genuine. May be the great may not be able to find something, which very ordinary may find. For example, if you see, the life of Christ. What was he? A carpenter’s son. having only two ropes to cover his body. What was his mother? Uneducated woman. If you see Krishna, what was he? He was the one, who was playing with the cows, a cowboy. What was their background, as far as the rationality was concerned? So, if somebody finds the thing, it should not upset anyone. You could have found it.

And, I would have been, actually in your seat, I don’t mind. I could have been better, I tell you. To find something like that, is a big headache. I can tell you. Then, to tell that I have found it, is a greater headache. You must wear a helmet for a thing like that, when you are saying it.

And, to announce it to many, then you had it. Thank God, nobody has stopped of crucifixion till today about me. But you can be in for any trouble whatsoever, if you say so. But there are many who say, who have their found. Then, what to do? You find yourself in a mess.

So, what have they found it? And, what do you have to find, is on one simple thing, you should decide. That, have you been able to get your own power? Is your rationality enlightened? If not, better get it enlightened and see for yourself, is a simple thing, is extremely simple. And, there is nothing to feel upset about it. Because, it is simple love.

I should have contained with my findings, would have been much easier for me, because, I am a happily married woman, with all the conveniences of life. But, this love, I do not know, I cannot keep it to myself. I have to give you. I have to give you. I wish, I could remain without disturbing you, but I have to. And, if that, is the way of looking at things, if you could excuse some of the things, that you may have to face. Because, you have to face that you haven’t got it as yet, which may be painful to some. That, you have not found it as yet.

You should understand, that it is in no way, to belittle you. But, to tell you that it is for all of you, I have found it. May be, that I am the one, who is crucified for all of you. Now, you better have it.

Until and unless, you have it, I am not going to feel alright. It’s a very, very simple thing. And, as soon as I entered into the hall, I did feel the rationality, looking at me with that critical eye, and I started off with that. But I would request you to relax, just relax. It’s not that difficult. You will be amazed, the things that we described as very difficult.

See sometimes, when I read these books which are being written about Kundalini, I get a shock of my life. I said, those who must have read this, would never see my face again. It’s a very simple thing. It’s a simplest and it will work out within you, no doubt. But after working it out, you have to know what powers you have got, how to ascertain it, and how to work out it. This is a very, very important part of it.

If you cannot do that, then, you will be again lost. I would request you, even after getting realisation, try to come and understand the whole mechanism within you. Master it. And you are the one who is going to give life to thousands. It is through your light people are going to be awakened.

So, understand your values that you are enlightened for a purpose. And, that purpose is to enlighten others. And, by which, you are going to help them, mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually. Apart from that, they are going to play as the instruments of God, understanding all His powers flowing through you, through your rationality.

Your rationality is going to see itself. It’s going to watch it. That, “Yes, the power is flowing through me. I can see. I can cure others. I am cured. I am going to do this. I am going to achieve this.” And, you are going to feel that bliss and joy within yourself.

I would like today, for you people to ask me some questions. Because, I still find, there are some questions, lingering behind the mind. Of course, the questions, as I said, are again worse, worse, worse, worse, worse. You can make a pyramid out of it, you see. And, the whole thing will fall down just like that. But still, if there are sensible questions, so very good to raise. I would love to answer all of them. Because, I am here first to satisfy. Then, when you are satisfied about it, to give you what you have within you, just your own key of your own greatness, of your own glory, of your own powers. Nothing more than that. Because sort of I feel like a trustee of those keys with me. Or, I know, where they lay.

On Kundalini, they have got very good and outside thing, I hope they have brought some. And, moreover, Sunday and Monday, I will be in the Ashram. And, those who have come for the first time, can come in the evening there. And, we can talk about it more, and you can, sort of, absolutely stabilize your realisation.

May God bless you! We will have that session after you have asked me questions. Thank you very much.

[Part 2]

Question asked by Sahaja Yogi: (Voice is not clear.)

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. It is all right. It can come from anyone. It can enter into you through any forces. It is very true. I mean, they can. See, until and unless absolutely you are a hippopotamus, you cannot get rid of it. But you have to become that cow in Sahaja Yoga. Once you are back, no negative energy can disturb you. But, of course, it can. That is a magnificent thing. Isn’t it? So, I would say, will talk about it later, Will you come to the Ashram? You see, because, I know, I will talk about negative things later, will. Alright? How they work out and how they are horribly attacking us. And how we have to look after, for realised souls, you see. Only until and unless you are realised, it is rather difficult. You cannot do that. But now you know that.

And there are negative forces, there are. We are everyday clearing the mass, you see, in the programs, and all, they are pulled from here. The other day, we had a boy, who started a fighting here and he got really mad but he will be alright, I am sure he will be alright, he is not a bad person. It is some bad or negative forces, it’s true but how to find out and all that, we have lots of fighting methods and this greatest contribution is done by Mohammed Saheb Himself. He has given lot of ways and methods, the real those ones to remove those things and how we have to look for realised souls. He has really done a good job. And the greatest mantra this is Lord’s prayer because Christ is the one who removes all our negativities. So, Lord’s prayer is best for keeping Agnya Chakra alright, to have it open, but after realisation. Before realisation it has no meaning, it’s just words, words and words. After realisation Lord’s prayer is very good and of course you must have detailed idea about the whole thing, and that’s the way it should be.

Sahaja Yogi: {Question voice not audible.}

Shri Mataji: No, I would not say but it’s maturity, some people mature just like that, they mature so fast, it is so surprising how they mature, and some of them do not, they take time. For example, the Kundalini may break through, may come out and give vibrations.

Then the second stage starts. When you get thoughtless awareness with that, you feel absolutely relaxed and first shot is really a very, very big good experience for so many of them. But then what happens, that you have problems within your chakras. So, Kundalini which is just waiting and feels going up, she will shoot up but then it goes back and starts supplying the different chakras which have problems. When such a thing starts, you start doubting, so you go into doubting stage. When you have to rise up to doubting awareness, when it is a slow-moving thing... Say from here I have to go to America, you can go straight, otherwise if it is slow moving thing, you may go by a ship touching all the ports. So, if it is a slow-moving thing, then may be maturity takes its time.

But in Sahaja Yoga in a first shot Kundalini rises just like that, shoots up, but second, shot goes back and then slowly, slowly comes up enlightening all the chakras and looking after them, physically helping them and some people have mental problems, solving them, and things like that. At this time, naturally a person starts doubting, and when you start doubting, the movement of the Kundalini is poor, very poor. But what is the solution for this? Is to remember your first experience, not to forget it. If you remember your first experience, then you will not go back.

This question of doubting is very common, where people use their rationality too much. Because you think, “Oh, I had vibrations, so what?” Finish! Because you must know that this is the ocean of knowledge. Say you are coming to this room; you don’t have to the whole of rooms coming these through. So even to know that’s the whole, you have to move about and find out. After realisation you have to find out all the areas of your being fully and that’s out you are going to be the masters. But you are chosen to be that. But why do you sometimes are doubting? What do you get? Every time you ask, “What do I get out of it? Nothing. So, I doubt to find that out.” Again, “What do I get if I go backward? I do not find out.” Again, you go forward, again you go forward, and you will find that you have really got something that you will never redeem it, it’s fantastic because it’s all dimensional growth which we cannot otherwise achieve by our thinking, by our effort.

Sahaja Yogi: (Question voice is not clear.)

Shri Mataji: You have gone into doubt. What faith you have? What is alright? Let’s rationalise, what is alright here? The way you live you feel it’s alright. What do you think when you say, “I’m alright”? But If you think like that, it is good, you are alright. What is the meaning of this also? Even if you are alright but why have you become a human being, that’s the point after all? Have you been able to answer through your life? Why are you here on this Earth? For what? Maybe you are alright but why are you here? Say for example here is an instrument, it is alright, nothing wrong with it, but why it is here? It’s the point. Alright? You see, if you think like that, what is the positive? If he thinks by coming here, he becomes negative so what is the positive? How you will understand because you haven’t had any experiences? If you have an experience and you work it out then... Outside only you started giving all things, you are not been in. Suppose you are not been to Paris and I say, “Oh I think Paris is the worst place”, so what you will say about, that Mother has not been fair. So, I could say same about you but I would not. I have accepted all of you as you are. I have to work it out, not you. You don’t know by doubting, you are not going to help me absolutely. There are many who will tell that Mother has to work very hard for the negativity. That’s what I teach it.

So, by doing this I mean first of all one must know there is no obligation on me if you have come here by any chance. First to realise this then start coming here. It’s a big time within you. What are you going to give me? Just think like that. What are you going to give me by saying that, “I feel negative”. You are not going to be certified about it. What is your credibility? What are you going to give me? Nothing. I am saying I am going to give you a gift so what’s the use of saying that, “I do not believe it”? Suppose I said, “I got a diamond ring which I am going to give you here”, you will come all the way from Australia running, then you will not ask any question. Now this is the rationality, see it. You understand? So, the thing is first you have to work out to get it, this is your own power, do not cheat yourself, do not go against yourself. You have nothing to lose, I have nothing to gain out of it. Simple thing, if you understand it without feeling hurt.

Another question asked by Sahaja Yogi: (Voice not audible.)

Shri Mataji: Why I am doing it? Because that is done for all of you, that’s all. I get my fulfilment. Everything is not done in the same way as human beings do. Why did Christ get crucified? Can you answer that question? What did he get out of crucifixion? Why does the sun shines? What does it get out of shining? Why does a candle burn? What does it get out of burning? Everything is not done for some gain. It’s only human beings who want everything out of everything. What does animal expect from you? Why it is put in here? What’s the use of everything? Why it is for? (Voice not audible) What have you given to nature that has created you? What have you given so far? After realisation you can, but not before that. What have you given to society which has been created? Just tell me.

So, there is a nature also, so abundant, just so beautiful. What do we do? God has given us so much. What do we give to God? What kind of thing we can give to God? What do we have, that can be given? There are some things which are done just for you. There are some things there to take. Life is made like that. What does a mother expect from a baby? I don’t know about the modern one. What he can give? This is not economic enterprise. Alright? Understand! Good.

Question by Sahaja Yogi: (Voice not audible.)

Shri Mataji: It’s a very good question. If I start speaking of that, already I am gone into the negative forces. I do not know where I will be landing. So, it is a very good question which you want to know. I would like to answer this question when we meet in Ashram. If I start talking of Lord Krishna, I would be bit lengthy. Something that is endless. Let’s go slowly, slowly to it. I know that’s a very good question. Because I have talked of Sat-Chit-Ananda but not about Shri Krishna so much so far. I have on about Vishuddhi Chakra but I have to take on it also. Didn’t talk about Him.

As we know, we have to have, as you said there are stages or not. It’s not question of stages but there are people you see people get realisation alright, they have the vibrations, know about chakras. But with the ego-oriented society like today what happens, is people start drifting with their doubts first of all. Even if they do not drift, is difficult to accept what Sahaja Yoga is. All this takes time, and time has to be given. No doubt. Some people do not. That’s why I would not like to expose every one of you to that kind of the whole thing. But it will be progressive, you will be definitely seeing all that. Because you see the light. Now you have opened out your eyes, you can see the light, you can bear a particular light of a particular intensity and when you open your eyes more and you can bear more when you have strength to bear it, then you should see more light. Because I do not want that you should again be lost because you cannot face the truth with that intensity and that’s the reason we have done that way. Gradually only with six people worked on them initially and then gradually and gradually we had to work it out. Because I have seen that the way people have reacted, it doesn’t help them much. But it does gradually help them if you expose them to the truth that as much as they can absorb it. It’s like a little child you see, you have changed the mixture of water and milk, and how it’s cooked, then you can give pure milk because it can digest.

There is another thing which I have to tell you that for reality you have to face that with boldness, one thing. Another thing is that when you see reality coming to it, you don’t depend on your feelings so called but only on the vibratory awareness that you have achieved, not on the feelings, you see, “I feel like that”. Now you have been feeling like that so what? You have achieved that. Because so far, your feelings have not been enlightened. Only the vibratory awareness by which you get your vibrations, only through that you should see everything, because it’s a new awareness. Because so many people, you see, “I feel like that”. It’s so arbitrary, it has no meaning. How do you feel? Why you feel like that? It’s just a whim of the brain.

It must be something absolute and that is what happens. “Enlightened” means you know everything in an absolute way; there is no second way. Whatever you know through your vibratory awareness is an absolute truth whom you have achieved, you cannot side. Anything: somebody believes in God, somebody doesn’t believe in God. You cannot explain. That’s I feel, then there is what. How do you feel? Another doesn’t feel. He is also a human being. So, your feeling has no meaning. But we just say, “I feel”. Because you can say this thing but it is not truth,

Question asked by Sahaja Yogi: (Voice not audible.)

Shri Mataji: What language you speak? Greek? That is too much for me, Greek and Latin said to be most difficult language. But there is no language of love. I know vibratory awareness. There’s no language. It is an absolute language, it works out. So, you can ask question about Christ, you can ask question on your vibratory awareness. Ask any question about Him. Was He the Son of God Almighty? It’s a great question. Ask it with that, with the protocol, because He is not standing on the street. Just to ask a question, ask with a protocol. Was He the Son of God Almighty? Most of you will feel it but those who haven’t got vibratory awareness cannot feel it.

And also, these negativities that you said, is about this doubting, also sometimes could be back, which is all the time waiting at the doorstep, but you have to be bold about it. Greeks can ask, “What so greaty is an Incarnation or Primordial Master?” His birthday was celebrated the other day. That day, I was so very happy to know this, extremely happy. That’s alright. Anthony and Andrew bought some flowers to me and said to me today is His birthday, I was so happy all the time. Was He the incarnation of our sustenance? Is He within us who looks after our sustenance? He was not the property of Greeks. He was everybody’s property, which is within us. On this Earth, He existed. You can ask and know on vibrations.

(Question not audible.)

Shri Mataji: Ask such questions which can be answered only on vibratory awareness. That’s the trouble with everybody. That’s it, see, that’s the trouble with human beings here. (Shri Mataji laughs) Christ they don’t think much of Him. Now they think because He is no more. What do you think about this? Not even one educated person went to Him, not one. As a person they don’t think much of Socrates, did they? Every word that Socrates had said, is absolute truth. And these are the human beings who are evaluating Him. What is their measure? Then they crucified Christ and thought that they have done the greatest job. Some of you might have been at that time also there and some of you might have been helplessly watching the whole thing, must have been redoing all. Not only that, but you knew not doing the right thing but could be of no help.

So let us not do it same again, let us keep ourselves open because you have nothing to lose again.

So, should we go ahead now? You have to just put your hands like this, because all your points are your centres here. All the seven centres are here. And left and right sympathetic nervous systems, both are expressed on your fingertips, here and here. There are seven chakras 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. And when you keep your hands towards me, actually, through these centres, information goes inside these centres and then Kundalini rises with the invitation of the vibrations. When vibrations go inside, they invite Kundalini to rise. She knows. Now she has risen out of joy, just out of joy, like a river when she knows, sees the sea, she hears the voice of sea, she rushes. In the same way Kundalini flows. It happens like that. And I hope it is going to happen to all of you, that you receive it. That I can assure. But I cannot assure your stabilisation, that I leave it to you. That stabilising you have to work it out. Before realisation you don’t have to do anything but after realisation you have to stabilise yourself. May be some percentage will not require anything but it’s just stabilizing, some will.

Question asked by new seeker: (Voice not audible.)

Shri Mataji: Let’s have it, so many are anxious to have it and there is a big lecture on that. I think I have spoken for three hours on that topic. I don’t mind speaking again and also you can feel it.

Now Self is the one that is in your heart, that is reflection of the Divine, which you realise, means you know yourself. You will know what you are, all your centres, know centres of others and power of Self is pulsation of vibrations which will flow, through which you will know everything that you have not known so far. Self-realisation is a simple thing. In very simple words is the connection of your attention into the Divine. Like as I said there is pattern on this carpet and there is colour. You cannot see the colour; you see the pattern. That’s why your attention is on the pattern, not on the colour. That is Divine play. By Self-realisation, you jump on, I would say, you get aware of that colour, which is all pervading, which is dynamic, which is God’s love.  You become one with that, which is self-realisation and which will gradually manifest and explain itself to you.

But to give complete elaborate idea about Self, I will tell you later. Better get it and best is to have it.

Question by new seeker: (Voice not audible.)

Shri Mataji: Yeah, you see you will know it, whether you have got it or not and whether the other has got it or not, once you have it. Once you have it, not only that you will know but that, whether you have got it or not, you will also know that the other got it or not, if somebody claims he has got it but you will know that he has not yet got it, because if such a person is self-realised, he would be emitting vibrations and you can feel them through your vibrations.

So, just put your hands like this and close your eyes, no thoughts in your mind, just watching. Ask your mind, “What are you thinking?” Close your eyes, please close your eyes. Because if you don’t get your realisation, you will not know what about happens...
