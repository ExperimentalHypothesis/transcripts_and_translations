Shri Mataji: I was telling you about this gentlemen, Indian, whose a doctor , who had been to TM.TM started showing, He said, there is a problem in our collectivity, I said why. Because Angie has married a lady, whose already a married lady. I said who told  you. So, he said her husband came and complaint to me, that she is a married lady and now she has married Angie. I said, Doctor if you have some common sense, try to understand, that a married lady cannot marry someone else and if she marries he can file a suit against her. So she is not married to him definitely now. Then Angie told me She is already divorced Mother. They don’t believe me, they believe in that man. I said never believe a non sahaja yogi. Simple logic is if she was married to him, they would arrest her. TM' s bhoot effect was on him , I said don’t try to create problem in collectivity.

It’s Angie who has worked it out single handedly, He stayed there for such a long, he is the one who worked it out.  Now you are trying to say these things to me. <Unclear>

He says, this is bad, that is bad. TM has this kind of bhoot,you see,  it just comes up, trying to find faults with leader or something, Trying to be very wise. But if you get rid of it, then they are very good.
