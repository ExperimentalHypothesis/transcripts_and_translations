Informal Talk

NOTE from: Clare Nesdale
Shri Mataji arriving at Perth Airport 1992, and the arrival talk at Robin and Jo Reid’s cottage, Lake Josephine, Gidgegannup… this was the first time Shri Mataji stayed at Gidgegannup… we had a puja the year before, 1991 at the hanger with Shri Mataji at Gidgegannup
When Shri Mataji came to Perth in 1992, it had been very dry and hot and we were quite worried. It was 45 degrees and we thought it would be too hot for Shri Mataji, She was arriving at 2am Friday morning. A few hours before Shri Mataji arrived, a big thunderstorm arrived from out of nowhere and there was thunder and lightning. This was February in Perth and normally we have no rain for about four months at this time, but suddenly this huge storm arrived and rain bucketed down. So much water came down and the temperature fell by about ten degrees, by the time Shri Mataji’s plane came it was much cooler.
We asked Shri Mataji about it and She said that the trees were crying out for water so it had to rain. The next night was the public program at Fremantle Town Hall and we were worried about the new people coming, it was still raining hard, Shri Mataji told us that the real seekers would come and the Town Hall was completely packed and people told us that they had stood in water up to their ankles while waiting for the bus to come to the program.
Shri Mataji’s car, after the program was heading back to Gidgegannup and passed a lot of cars on one side of the motorway that were bogged, stuck in water because there was so much rain, Shri Mataji said “Oh dear.” And at that point the rain stopped.
“Do you see the Ganas that are coming with us on each side of the car?” Shri Mataji said a few minutes later. The yogis in the car with Shri Mataji looked out, and about 50 cm, 18 inches, on each side of the car, just outside the windows were sort of balls of fire, balls of white light, about the size of a baseball. Each one, there was one on each side of the car, had a long tail of light that went back for about 20 feet and they travelled with the car for about 20 minutes.
“These Ganas are always with us, but this time you can see them”, Shri Mataji explained. When Shri Mataji arrived at the ashram it was lit with candles throughout because there had been a power cut, power lines had been brought down by the storm. She Mataji said how good this was, and was pleased. “It will get rid of all the negativity,” She said.
