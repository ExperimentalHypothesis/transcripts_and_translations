1983-0111_Farewell_Evening_Rahuri_India (Transcription and translation)

Shri Mataji: You must finish this job as fast as possible. Where are you, Dhumal?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, please tell me.

Shri Mataji: Where are those idols?

(To Sahaja Yogis): It is cold now, you see. The way we are living, it has become cooler. Always it happens - in Pune they were saying the same thing happened. So we enjoyed all the temperate climate.

No, now I am fed up of speaking. How many speeches? So now you should go tomorrow - they have arranged breakfast in a school here. And then you have to proceed further to Dhulia. Reaching there, about four hours it takes. Don't stop the car much in between.

It is about four hours. So if you leave at 10:30, you will reach there by about 2:30. Try to leave at 10:00, will be better - so you will reach there about 2:00. And Raolbai has arranged your stay there, in a big place she says. And the food will be ready for you there. So you can have your lunch. I hope you have enjoyed your lunch today here.

Sahaja Yogis: Yes (applause).

Shri Mataji: So we are all going to Dhulia. But I am coming via Bombay. And I will meet you in Dhulia. Day after tomorrow morning.

So we have now, actually, the papers are not yet in. We have achieved this land. Already the owner has given it, the gram panchayat. And I don't know, the village [UNCLEAR]. And we have another land in Niya, near Nira which [UNCLEAR], that is also about to be bought today. Legally. Because it has to be done legally also. Dhumal has promised to do it. Before I leave from India.

These two lands are definite. There is another land about eleven acres away. Next to the lake, near the temple that you have seen. But all these will be used for meditation and a temporary stay. But the land they have given Me, personally - which I don't think I will have it on My name.

But there, where My forefathers ruled or lived. We are going to build a place for about a hundred and fifty people. Gradually. But we have to have some people who should be willing to come here, work out the project of Sahaja Yoga - on different lines.

Then, the second thing is that today we have one land, which is also given to Me freely. Which must also be finalized very soon. So you must play that [UNCLEAR]. Once we have got already, which is given to us for [unclear/our work]. There is one school which is for children in Rahuri. Which is a residential school which they are going to give Me. Or this trust whatever they have. In which I think we should start very soon. We should start.

And I would like one of you who is interested in education, to take it up seriously. And work it out with the government and everyone. One of the Indian [UNCLEAR]. And then you can also join them. So the school is already; there is a residential school, and the property is there. They can give us ninety-nine years lease for no price at all. We have to run it and manage it. So it is all for ninety-nine years lease. It is perfectly all right.

And we have to just get a bus for that school. For that, I am going to see somebody who might just donate. That is quite possible in this country. To get a thing donated [UNCLEAR]. So, that is all the projects so far here.

And in Delhi, we have already one place where we have started our work, where there is a little ashram as they call it. There is a room for Me, and a good place for meditation. And we hope to get a larger place for the Sahaja Yogis to live. Also, there are certain problems with it.

You know in Pune, Abhay's mother has given Me land. Where we can have a hall. And also residential quarters for you people. When you come, you can come and stay there. So that is also in My head. All these things we have to manage.

So far, whatever money you have given Me for the building is still in London or in Australia. Which I have not utilized. But, I will go back and wisely see where we have to send what money, how much to whom and where to send how much. And to the Indians. Plus the Indian people are going to give us some money. And we are going to work it out this way.

Now, this Nira land, I am more interested. Because once we have it, it is freehold land. And where it is such a big land that you all can build your own little cottages. I mean, I can build for you. And which, whenever you come, you can stay there, look after it. Also when you are not there, some people can occupy. But you will have the priority to stay there. Always.

And if you come here, say after retirement you want to spend your time, then you are very much welcome. But to develop that land would really need money because we have to close the banks completely. What do you call them, what is it called? I had asked today, they fill it with stone and build a dam on it.

Sahaja Yogi: Bunding?

Shri Mataji: Bunding.

Sahaja Yogi: It is called pitching.

Shri Mataji: Pitching. That we have to do. Pitching and bunding. And then the land would be very good for us and we have to lift the water. And for irrigation. It is a very beautiful land because it is all coming out of the Nira river. So these are all the little projects that we have.

See how it can be achieved by next year. But I think within two years, many things can be done. If we are steady in our progress in Sahaja Yoga; within and without. Within is very important. If you are within deeper and sincere, then God will bless us. Otherwise, I don't need any place to live. I can live under a tree. So God is not going to give for Me.

Only for your sake, He is going to do everything. So you have to be very sincere people and good towards yourself and not to be materialistic. To be a little detached. And trusting in God. You must trust in God. Must have more trust in God than you have in banks and in your money. All right? Otherwise, a lot of upheaval will come. Your pounds will lose, your francs will lose, your French francs will lose - this will happen, that will happen.

So that you will start feeling insecure and feel security in God. Before that, why not have security in God? All right?

So now this is another occasion; we have to bid farewell. To Rahuri people. There are two representatives sitting here. On your behalf, I would like to thank all the Rahuri people who have organized your stay, which was very comfortable. And enjoyable to all of us. We will give them a hand.

[Applause].

Now after that, now they want to bid you farewell. We have to make it short, out of everything, because the time is short.

Sahaja Yogi: Photo.

Shri Mataji: Now, first of all, they have got a photograph which they call as Maruti's photograph, which according to them is very good for people who suffer. Especially from negativity. For twelve centers. For the twelve countries, you see. So all the twelve countries must raise their hands. One, one from each so we will know who all the people are.

One by one you should take. One. Two. Maria's already raised her hand. French. Are they French? That's Steve?

Sahaja Yogini: No, that's Robert.

Shri Mataji: Robert. All right. One, two, three, four. Can you count for Me, someone?

I hope there is no repetition. Raise your hand. Three nations are lost. Where are they?

Sahaja Yogi: That's the eleventh.

Shri Mataji: Still one is lost. Australia. Italy is here. Engelbert. Done. All of them are here? Now put down your hands, please. She has brought it. Have you brought them? Now, these are the presents from Rahuri. For you, they have got some presents from Rahuri.

Where are they? Come quickly. Give this out. We got this in Pune. Please call them. There is no time. Where have they gone? One has to do it alone. You please bring them. Get it. This is for everyone.

Sahaja Yogi: These are twenty photos. You will need them there. [Applause]. These are twenty sets.

Shri Mataji: But first give them twelve. Now, let us have them one by one. Now, come along.

One, who is that? Rome. Austria. You must announce your names.

Sahaja Yogi: France.

Shri Mataji: France. This would be a nation?

Sahaja Yogini: America.

Shri Mataji: America. This is Vienna, Austria.Switzerland. So many countries, I am getting confused.

Malaysia. Mexico. This I don't know.

Sahaja Yogis: London. United Kingdom.

Shri Mataji: United Kingdom. May God bless your work.

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Mataji Nirmala Devi ki Jai.

Shri Mataji: Gavin. So why not put off these for a while?

Sahaja Yogi: We won't be able to see you, Mother.

Shri Mataji: No, no, if you put it off - this may be overloading. These are very heavy lights you see. Maybe. If you put it off. That's all.

Sahaja Yogi: That's only running on 500 watts.

Shri Mataji: All right. Then it's all right. Keep one.

This one we should say, from Dhulia to all the centers, you see. You see, this is from the Dhulia center.

Have you got only eleven?

Sahaja Yogi: I do not know.

Shri Mataji: Are there twelve?

Sahaja Yogi: This work was not given to me.

Shri Mataji: This we have got earlier. Three and four - there are only eleven.

Sahaja Yogi: Two, four, five, and six. How many are those?

Shri Mataji: Five. We had eleven centers or twelve have come up. So I think for one center, I will buy again. For her. You can forget about London. London has got all the things. so, all the eleven centers. London I will manage.

This is from, actually Dhulia. We are giving it to you because I don't know, I am now going by train.

Now see if there are eleven. These are again eleven. Leave aside London, I will look after London separately. See if there are eleven.

Sahaja Yogi: These are mugs.

Another Sahaja Yogi: I would like to say, we don't really have a center yet, in Belgium.

Shri Mataji: You will have.

Sahaja Yogi: It is just my apartment.

Shri Mataji: All right. Your apartment is our center for the time being.

To first Sahaja Yogi (counting and instructing on the pancharati pieces): Show them how to make it. Now, this is pancharti. So now, each center. Let's have it. Eleven centers. Because again, London I will manage.

This time I have to buy something in silver for them because whatever they have belongs to Me and I will have to take it back and they will be left high and dry. Big problem.

Pass it on. [UNCLEAR/You will] like that. Here. It's a beautiful piece you see.

This is how it is made. You see, you have to take out the stand, and put it in between this one and on top, this.

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes for all of them. Eleven. Except for London. England I mean. Is it done?

Sahaja Yogi: These storage containers are there.

Shri Mataji: Of what? They are left. Those who did not get these. Those who did not get one of these Ö.

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR/photo copies]. 108 are there.

Shri Mataji: Of these also. Then 108 are there. Sonia, give them these, My photos. Just give them to her because she is going away now. [UNCLEAR]. All right, give it to them. They are giving.

May God Bless You. You also please come along.

Sahaja Yogi: Mataji.

Shri Mataji: What happened? Yes? What has happened? I am hardly going away now. She is already crying because she has to go away now. Now what? What has happened? Nani (grandmother) is also going with you. She is crying for all of you. Though I am going with her. That's the Indian heart.

All right, these 108. For Rahuri and other places. Give these to Chavan. Chavan saheb, you please keep it. Keep it now. 108. Those who are established Sahaja Yogis, make a committee of those, and then give them away. Because we now have grown a lot. Of them, those who are established Sahaja Yogis; not necessary to give them all in one day. Keep them with you in the store. And write down to whom you have given them to because it will be better for us.

Shri Mataji's grandchild: Nani, Bala is asking for a photo for Singapore.

Shri Mataji: Haven't we given the photo for Singapore? Bala? We will give you later on. I will give you later. What's that?

Sahaja Yogini: Can we give this in Brighton? Can we give this poster print in Brighton?

Shri Mataji: For what?

Sahaja Yogini: It is so beautiful.

Shri Mataji: For these people? I have already given them this. For Rahuri we have given. Haven't we given this photo for Rahuri?

All right. This is from Brighton.

Sahaja Yogi: This is for Gregoire's daughter.

Shri Mataji: Where is Gregoire? Has he come? You see, Gregoire's wife is supposed to be from Rahuri because Dhumal and his wife gave her hand to Gregoire. So they have to do something for the children. There is a present for the little baby in silver.

Sahaja Yogi: There is also a whistle.

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Shri Mataji: Where is Gregoire?

Sahaja Yogi: This is for Barbara. This sari is for Barbara.

Shri Mataji: Which Barbara? From Australia?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Hugo's wife.

Shri Mataji: Hugo's wife, Barbara. You can take it for Gregoire's child. Come along. For Barbara, a sari. Come along. You see, nothing is given to the father. I am sorry.

Sahaja Yogi: The van is here.

Shri Mataji: Are they here?

Sahaja Yogi: And these are photos. They can give them to whomever they like. Smaller copies of the same ones.

Shri Mataji: Gregoire has come. I will give it to him. Now, there are photographs in this one. Somebody has to honestly count them. And give it to people. I don't know how you will distribute them. I think I will give it to Gavin. It is British honesty.

You must give it according to the number and Öbecause they may not be exactly the same. But if you can avoid doubling. Gavin? This is a good photograph for the negativity. If you avoid doubling, we can do it. There might be another thing there. Gavin Brown. He is coming here.

Sahaja Yogi: We had given copies of these the previous year.

Shri Mataji: Those who have been given these. Gregoire, what a little time you took. It's been two hours.

Gregoire: I know, just going there, it's .., what to do?

Shri Mataji: All right. Now, so this is for your baby Niranjana and [UNCLEAR] whistle.

Sahaja Yogis: Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Shri Mataji: This is from Mr. Dhumal and family to their grandchild. Just have it. No, you can't do that. Just have it. Come along with both hands.

Sahaja Yogi: For Bill Brandon.

Shri Mataji: Bill Brandon. For what have you given it?

Sahaja Yogi: Nothing, just.

Shri Mataji: This is for controlling the crowds. What do you say to that? Indians are very observant.

Sahaja Yogi: Dr. Warren.

Shri Mataji: This is for Dr. Warren, for keeping his throat all right.

Sahaja Yogi: And Gavin Brown.

Shri Mataji: This is to Mr. Gavin Brown for ultimately arriving somewhere.

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Shri Mataji: And, to arrival at Waterloo. What's going to happen to the British army and navy now, I don't know.

Is it done now?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Another Sahaja Yogi: This is for Shonu, Mother.

Shri Mataji: What's it? For whom? This you have given already.

Sahaja Yogi: Shonu.

Shri Mataji: Shonu.

Sahaja Yogi: And Anand.

Shri Mataji: This is for Shonu and this is for Anand. Sonia, take this. Now, this is for not crying at all, for Shonu. And this is for Anand, for not coughing at all.

Done? Is everything done?

Sahaja Yogi: There is a photo for Singapore.

Shri Mataji: Give it.

Other Sahaja Yogi: I just have a couple of posters.

Shri Mataji: Now, Singapore. Bala, one for negativity. First, and foremost. Give him one.

Sahaja Yogi: This is the other one.

Shri Mataji: Keep these for Delhi people. There are extra people coming to Delhi. We can keep some of the remaining items for them. Keep this. Why give them today?

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: This one (photo) for the negativity. Singaporeans, never see deep. Poor Bala is going to have a hard time with them. Never seeking anything. They are very happy that Singapore is very clean and that people are fined fifty pounds if they throw litter on the streets. That they boast of. That's all. Nothing else at all.

So Singapore is a difficult city and all of you must really give it a big bandhan. Done?

[Sahaja Yogis give a present for Rahuri center].

Shri Mataji: For Rahuri center. [UNCLEAR]. Delhi I am going to have a hard time because they are going to say [UNCLEAR]. One we can give to Rahuri, but we have to give to Delhi and Nasik. Better keep it.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, I am leaving. [UNCLEAR/The Australians still have stuff].

Shri Mataji: Yes, but have they got it? No, but keep it. I will give them, doesn't matter. [UNCLEAR/Keep it]. You keep it with the Australians, they will give it to Me. This also, Do you want this?

Sahaja Yogi: Keep it.

Shri Mataji: Take it if you want it. If this is required for Dhulia, especially.

Sahaja Yogi: Needed for Rahuri.

Shri Mataji: Rahuri needs it? Take it for Rahuri. It is one of the better ones. Show it to him. That one is good, this one.

[Possible gap in recording].

Shri Mataji: Öwith Myself. In our expression outside and within yourself. Though these people are always enamored because you are guests, whatever you may be. And they are going to garland you. But you should garland yourself, by understanding your Self. All right?

So now, you are going to Dhulia. It's a four hours drive, not much. But, the first time I am going by train. And I hope to see you there. And Dhulia, I hope you will be comfortable. I don't know where Raolbai has arranged your things. She said it is quite a comfortable place. Whatever it is, you know these are smaller places where we are going.

And we have a very good program for you in Nasik. And there is a Shiva linga which is a swayambhu. But we don't know if they will allow you inside. I will talk to the manager - these are all saints and they should be allowed under the laws of Shiva. Is one of the swayambhus. Jyotirlingas. You see, we have twelve jyotirlingas. Out of these, one of them is here. Imagine. But because of the Muslim invasion and all that, they [UNCLEAR].

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR] give the manager a bandhan?

Shri Mataji: Give the manager a bandhan. You will see this Chaturshinghe. You will see that. At Nasik.

Sahaja Yogi: It's cold, Mother. Feeling cold.

Shri Mataji: Shiva. Shiva's temple. Is he better now? He should be warm. Better. What now?

Sahaja Yogi: This is for the service of Rahuri and Rahuri should become the world's university; this is the only prayer at your Feet.

Shri Mataji: Now, My forefathers came to your Rahuri itself, now what more is required?

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Adishakti Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.
Sahasrara Swamini Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Sahaja Yoga Dayini Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Shri Mataji: You see, I told them, My forefathers only came in this Rahuri area. Where can I avoid them, you see? It's My forefather's land only I got. First I got. What can be done? It's all done. And you will be amazed, I caught Right Heart, you see. Not Me, but everybody else caught Right Heart. So, I told My forefathers, I am going to take this land. And I gave them a bandhan. And the Right Heart [UNCLEAR]. Can you believe it?

What?

Sahaja Yogi: I would like to say a few words.

I do namaskar to Parampujya Mataji. To Parampujya Mataji, on behalf of the Rahuri center, we have this request, that Parampujya Mataji utilize our physical being for the work of Sahaja Yogi, and so I offer this at Her Feet.

Further, to Parampujya Mataji, we, the Rahuri center would like to request that Mataji give us strength, brains, and wisdom to achieve success in the work of Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: It's been given, all of it. It has already been given.

Sahaja Yogi: Further, we request our foreign guests, that if they have been inconvenienced in any way during their stay, they may please forgive us. Please be tolerant. And we invite them to visit us again and again.

Shri Mataji: He is asking your pardon for not giving a comfortable stay here. But you forgive us for that and I request you to come back again to Rahuri.

[Sahaja Yogis are making arrangements to offer garlands and bouquets to the visitors].

Sahaja Yogi: Most worshipful Mother. Brothers and sisters from Rahuri. Kharovi(?) is the name for Sahaja Yogi, which is like no other name in India. We have also experienced that we have been fighting our own thoughts during an important part of this journey. And we have taken time to melt into the peace and the beauty and the spiritual beauty of this country. That many of us noticed that as soon as we arrived here in Rahuri, with the puja of Shri Mataji - the experience of Reality became much stronger.

I have a special debt to Rahuri, which I don't know how to pay back. Maybe I will do something one day. But, it is not only in my personal name but in the name of all of us. That we would like to thank you, for one thing, brothers and sisters of Rahuri. In that, like, our Mother, you see our Spirit. You don't see all our limitations. Because you see our Spirit, you can see our true dimension, our nature. And because you, our beauty, we will become beautiful.

We thank you also of all the care that you have taken of us. We know that it involved an incredible amount of work and activity. On top of all the programs of Sahaja Yoga, you had to look after us. It was so much work. Thank you very much.

I would like to talk a little bit about Shri Dhumal. I know Shri Dhumal could not do anything by himself. Because all work in Sahaja Yoga is number one, done by the Goddess; number two, is collective. Yet, the leader is the one who is able to mobilise the commitment and the participation of others. And for this, Shri Dhumal is an example. Because, whenever and wherever we are in contact with him, he emits simplicity and love. And that is why he is such a convincing Sahaja Yogi example for all of us.

Because simplicity and love cannot be faked. Cannot be artificial. It is just being which convinces us. It is not what we say, nor what we even organize. It is what we are which matters in Sahaja Yoga. And for me personally, Shri Dhumal has been a reference when I have been confused by certain Sahaja Yogi. I was thinking, ìIs he really a great Sahaja Yogi or not?î. Then I would think about Shri Dhumal. I would feel his love, his tenderness, his beautiful simplicity, and then I would know - this is right; this is what I have to achieve.

It is my prayer that all of us Westerners, in the same way, the Indian, are able to see our Spirits and not the gross aspects that we have. It is my prayer that we all see the beauty. Which is so subtle, so gentle, so discreet that it needs an educated heart to find them. But, we are being educated by a great Teacher.

Shri Mataji: I never educate. Please.

Sahaja Yogi: And it is at the Lotus Feet of the Holiest of the Holy. Of the most adorable incarnation that ever came. It is at the Lotus Feet of the Great Goddess, that we are gathered here.

And it is our earnest wish that She should be prasanna (pleased) in witnessing the love which is going to bind us evermore. Which is going to integrate us evermore. In all this Rahuri has played a very special role. We are coming to our place when we come to Rahuri; we feel it. Please, dear brothers and sisters from India, forgive us.

Whenever we are not proper reflectors of our Mother, we know it. We know that we have to improve tremendously. But we are eager to improve. And I know for sure, that you will be very proud of us, with the Grace of our Shri Mother.

[Shri Mataji is asking Sahaja Yogis to perform the garland ceremony at the station].

Sahaja Yogini: What if there is a problem there?

Shri Mataji: No, no there will not be any problem. The problem is that we must now hurry. Now, I have to be really smart to go back and catch my train. Those who want to come can walk down to the station; it is quite near. Or come by car or bus, whatever they want to.

It is just there. And there is simple food for tonight only. If you want to come to the station, you are welcome; otherwise, you can stay here. Have your food and then go back to Mula dam. All right?

May God Bless You.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, while are on the subject of food. While we are on the subject of food Mother, I think that a very special word should be said to Mrs. Dhumal.

All: Yes.

Sahaja Yogi: She is so busy right now that she is probably in the kitchen still cooking. I don't think any of us have ever enjoyed, so much the food and India as when we come to this place. And in her own very gracious and very great quality as Shri Dhumal's wife, she has given to all of us an example, and the [UNCLEAR/love]. And my goodness, she has given us the food of India.

Jai Mataji.

All: Jai Mataji.

Sahaja Yogi: Parampujya Shri Mataji and today, at this punyabhoomi of Rahuri, my dear Sahaja Yogi brothers and sisters who have come from here and abroad. Whatever gratitude that you have expressed, that gratitude is only the unselfish love of Parampujya Shri Mataji. The motherly compassion and the warmth of Her Love, that She has given to our lives, is being reflected from our hearts. In this great worldÖ

Shri Mataji: Now why? What happened to you to cry? I am just going to Dhulia. This is the same as a daughter getting married and she comes home the next day.

Sahaja Yogi: Mataji is our everything.

Shri Mataji: Now, do not cry.

Sahaja Yogi: We never think that we have done anything special for anyone. Because in all the trouble of this world, she has labored for us. The troubles to Her physical BeingÖ

Shri Mataji: Enough now. You do not cry. I have not had any troubles.

Sahaja Yogi: I cannot bear to see it.

Shri Mataji: Now please do not cry. Tell Me what happened.

Sahaja Yogi: If Mother is struggling so much for Her children, then if we merely make and serve a humble meal, there is no obligation in that.

Shri Mataji: All right now. If I start weeping there will be sea here right now.

Sahaja Yogi: So to be true to this love, all Sahaja Yogis should make a vow to Mother here today - that we will go away from the Truth. And we will not find faults with one another. And at a minimum, by next year each of us will create one strong Sahaja Yogi. Only then we will stand true to Mother's Love. With this, I end my speech. Jai Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Now you translate it. This will be like Me talking about Myself. You do the translation. This is a translation of what he said. And cried. Of course, you can't cry.

[Sahaja Yogi translates the above speech into English].

Shri Mataji: All right. Now I will speak at the end.

Today also I have a very big crying Heart, I must say. I am always afraid of it. So, it is a time of varied experiences this time. And of course, it appeared I was working very hard. I neither work nor I think about it. So I am perfectly all right. Nothing wrong with Me.

But while traveling during all these days; there is one thing I have discovered. That is how much we in the West live with unreal things. I mean, always we project an unreal image of ourselves. We live with unreality so much. There is no need. We waste so much energy in projecting that, our norms, and all that.

When your real Self is so beautiful, there is no need. When I saw the village women laughing on the streets seeing Me; feeling so happy, joyous as if a lotus is blooming before Me. So [UNCLEAR]. I felt they are so unpretentious and there is no need to create an artificial image in front of them. Nothing. Nothing to project [UNCLEAR]. Maybe torn clothes, maybe just by the way they are - they saw Me and just as if the sun has come out and the flowers are blooming. It is so beautiful an effect.

So I felt that we should not waste our efforts too much in living with unreal things. And so many unreal things are there. And so many of the real things we believe in also are so absurd. Like slavery of matter is also very absurd stuff. So, at a point, one must really get rid of it. This slavery must really be got rid of. It is too much and sometimes I feel that it really makes us too much overburdened. And we cannot feel the joy of life.

And the way they, you see, from the inner core of their heart, they felt when they saw Me. And that is something so rare to see. In the West, I feel - because you see even if the people they meet you, otherwise in Sahaja Yoga, of course, you see that. It is so artificial. And we are so surrounded by these people all the time. All of them.

[No sound. Recording resumes after 8 minutes. A Sahaja Yogi is giving a speech].

Sahaja Yogi:... It's like a car having two horses. The horse of the ego is running ahead all the time and the horse of the Spirit is lagging behind. Due to this what happens, actually our car or cart; it creates imbalances. Running like zig zag, zig zag. All the time it is running [UNCLEAR]. When our Kundalini is awakened from inside, by the process of meditation - gradually this ego horse; it comes under the control of the Spirit. Means it comes up to the level of the Spirit's horse. Like this.

And when these two horses run properly then there is no [UNCLEAR]. Same is with our life. We must know how to control and how to use our ego. One thing I want to suggest to you - don't think on a mental level. Even if you are having some ego - you know after realization - because you yourself become just like [UNCLEAR]. Everything you can see like a mirror. That is called introspection.

You look within yourself. Then you find ego is all the time disturbing you. Complete [UNCLEAR].

Bolo Jagan Mata Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

When you loom towards your ego, don't get angry with your ego. Behave with your ego just like your friend. Supposing I give a simple example so that you will understand. Imagine you are having a dog and which is a very fiery dog. Then what you do, you chain the dog. You put some bread or milk and keep the dog properly handled. In the same way, when our ego is overactivated, then you gently, and politely behave with it.

And you must even change your attitude of thinking. When the ego is always ahead, you must tell it, ìMr. Ego, why are you running so fast? Up till now, in my life, what have you given to me? Be calm and quietî. Tell him clearly. ìHere I am in Mother's Feet. Don't try to disturb meî. Simply you tell him. ìUp till now, by your order all my life, I have become tired. I could not find peace. So let me now by myself enjoy the joy of the Spiritî. In this manner, politely, you can decrease your ego.

So one should not make the ego his own enemy. And one thing I would like to suggest to you, Sahaja Yoga cannot be worked out on a mental level. You must have your action. When you are in company, you forget everything. Just like we are surfing the sea in a boat. We enjoy the glory of the sea. Why does it happen? Because there is no attachment of ownership and these things. Same thing happens in collectivity. Collectively we are [UNCLEAR]. Here you are, same reason. So one must forget about the past. One must think of the present. Life is decreasing; life is burning like a candle. Every moment, we are approaching towards death only. Isn't it? So we must not waste our life in these useless thinkings. Thinkings with the other people. We must look towards our Spirit.

And we must try to achieve more and more every moment. On the positive level. We must test our vibrations all the time; whether they are correct or not. Our, what we call chitta, is just like a camera. If you look towards a person, naturally the thoughts will come, naturally, the negativity will be caught. So don't think about others. Try to decrease. It will happen when you will practice more and more every day.

Whatever I have experienced is that only meditation can solve all these problems. Because from generations to generations, these deformities we are suffering. So it will take time. But one thing we must know is that our system is now open. And this Kundalini shakti will nourish us properly. Then what we have to do - we must meditate every day. We must keep our Kundalini in working position. Meditation is the best solution. To control your thoughts and ego. Naturally, it gets controlled.

Like I told you in the beginning, this ego horse is controlled by the Spirit. And when these horses run with the same speed in the line, then there is no jerk to your cart. Any more questions?

Some people I have seen do not put the shoebeats. When you put for the shoebeat, the lower side of the left shoe should face to the sky. And the upper portion must be - the reverse position you must put the shoebeats. And after putting shoebeats you must take yourself two bandhans. Because you are cleared. Then you put your shoebeats to your [UNCLEAR]. Any more questions? Gregoire?

Another Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR/Meditation..mantrasÖsuperego].

Sahaja Yogi: Mantra should not be mechanical. If you say the mantra of each chakra with a silent mind and just as if you are looking towards that deity, you are looking towards that chakra, closing your eyes, you must start with the mantras. Then the mantras are effective. Don't go on saying mantras, ìOm Shri Mahalaxmi, Mahasaraswati... Om Shri Mahalaxmi, MahasaraswatiÖî - this is a mechanical process. The mantra should be uttered in a very calm, silent way. You must find what effect it has worked. No need of saying mantras a hundred or two hundred times. It will naturally become a mechanical process. And Sahaja Yoga is not mechanical.

Another Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR]. If you do too many mantras, do youÖ

Sahaja Yogi: Whatever you act, you act it from your heart. You want to say the mantra, say it from the heart. If you say mantra on Swadhisthana chakra, Brahma Saraswati, you must see there is Brahma and Saraswati on that chakra. And pray to them. In this mood, you must say the mantra. Then it is more effective. Sahaja Yoga is not a mechanical process or don't make Sahaja Yoga a theoretical one.

Another Sahaja Yogi: Superego?

Sahaja Yogi: I do not know about superego. Ego is ego. Superego is his elder brother. Might be sister also. Grandson also. There are so many sections. So I do not follow too much theory. I accept that I am not learned, nor a man of science. But I am a man of practice. And that you should follow. Man of practice.

I want to ask you one question. Do you take salt treatment? Everyday?

Sahaja Yogis: Footsoak. Before we go to bed.

Sahaja Yogi: What do you call it? Everyday? All of you? Some are not taking. And what are your experiences? Do you close your eyes or open your eyes?

Another Sahaja Yogi: Open.

Sahaja Yogi: That is correct. Where do you watch towards?

Sahaja Yogis: Mother.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother's Right Hand or here. Not through the candle. Don't make it that. Only light is important. That is the question. And don't like, pierce. Just relax. That will be trataka again. You know trataka. Looking towards only one just like this thing. It also becomes a mechanical process then. We do not want that. We want the effect [UNCLEAR].

[Another Sahaja Yogi asks a question about Agyna].

Sahaja Yogi: Agyna is where the ego and superego - they are sucked in here. In this chamber. And this is the Right Hand; it is what is called protection. That is Aashirwaad what we say. I don't remember the proper word for it. It is a protection for you. Or you can concentrate here, on the Right Hand.

Another Sahaja Yogi: And not say any mantra?

Sahaja Yogi: If it is necessary for concentration. After all, why do we say the mantra? In order to concentrate on a certain chakra. It is like I am talking, why am I talking? In order to put your attention towards me. This is also the same thing with mantra.

A Sahaja Yogini: We have been told if we are sitting in the water, we cannot say any mantras.

Sahaja Yogi: Who told you? You can say. If you are not sitting for meditation, you can say it. In normal course also. There is no hard and fast rule. You can say it. Whatever you do, do it with your heart. Do you put bandhan to photograph? All of you?

Multiple Sahaja Yogis: Kumkum. Only in puja.

Sahaja Yogi: Do you clean the photo also with water? Vibrated water? Before? Just put vibrated water on the cloth and clean the photograph. Put your bandhans. One thing I would like to suggest is, do not give your photograph to any negative persons. Non-Sahaja Yogis should not be given the photograph. Non-Sahaja Yogis, especially. [UNCLEAR].

You should not give your kumkum to non-Sahaja Yogis. Your kumkum should be separate. Sometimes it happens. Non Sahaja Yogis, they touch your kumkum. And that's why the vibrations are really disturbed. Here the people really are too religious.

[A Sahaja Yogini asks about devotion, bhakti towards Shri Mataji].

Bhakti is too, bhakti is bhakti. Respect. You must say She is power, She is going to protect me, She is everything now and She has come in this world for us only now. So must take more and more advantage of every second in this life. I told you that life is burning just like a candle. Every moment, every fraction we are coming towards death. Then what is the use of spending our time here and there and chitchatting? You must take more and more. Because already we have lost so many years in ignorance. Before coming to realization we have lost so many years. Now after realization, we must stop it. We must think that life is decreasing every moment. Every moment we are coming to our death If you think like that, the overthinking business naturally gets controlled.

And don't get disheartened. ìBecause I cannot do itî. If you become like an actor - just ìI, I, Iî - ego increases. Always say ìhe, he, heî. Just stop this ìIî business. ìI did this, I have done thisî. You must say, ìHe did it. I am the witnessî. Do you think I work? Mataji works out everything. If you know the Truth then every time you will be joyous. And you will be knowing - at a certain point, at a certain limit - how the car has come here. It is a great planning. Divine planning. So, any more questions?

Another Sahaja Yogi: Will you speak about meditation, please?

Sahaja Yogi: Especially not. Meditation should be pure meditation. Meditation should be pure meditation. At the time of meditation.

Another Sahaja Yogi: More [UNCLEAR]. Meditation should be quiet or music or Ö?

Sahaja Yogi: It depends upon your nature which you prefer, which gives you comfort. Even your seat should be comfortable. If you sit on a chair, it will be comfortable. Then you use the chair. But if you sit on Mother Earth, then you find some trouble, then don't do that. Because physical comfort is also necessary in the initial stage to relax your mind and everything.

You can meditate anywhere. Suppose you are in the office and you have got free time, then you just put the bandhan. By putting your hand under the table and go on just meditating. Once you bring your Kundalini here and if you work, you will work perfectly. Because that is the blessing of Divine Power at that stage. Because you are not working, He is there now.

So try to forget yourself first. I am not here, I am just like a bubble in the ocean. It starts from the bottom of the sea, travels towards the surface of the sea, and then it vanishes. Same is with the life. Only this journey from the bottom to the surface is our life. One day this bubble will burst when it comes to the surface. Very simple, life. What do you call these air balloons? Balloons. But what does it contain? Air only. Outside is also air. Inside is also air. But why is it separate? Because of that rubber coating only.

Same is with human beings. Inside is Spirit. Outside is Spirit. These are separate things only due to this body. Then this individuality is formed. Then this ìIî business is, what we call, more and more developed. And we have to subside that thing. From inside. Not in mechanical. Don't get angry with your own Self. You must say, ìI have to learn, I have to do it. I have Mother's blessingî. You must think like that. If you are confident, then gradually Sahaja Yoga will be increased within yourself and amongst ourselves also.

You should be confident. That we have got the power. We are able to work through all these difficulties. Your confidence will guide you properly. Then you will be a guru, first of all, for yourself. If you are not confident, then how will you approach yourself, first of all? If all the time, your mind is fluttering just like this. Suppose you want to take a picture of a person with a camera. Say, fraction or a fraction of a second you find out steadiness there. It requires. If you go on moving, running in front of the camera, then how will you take the picture? It is difficult.

If you will not steady your mind, then how will you go towards your Spirit?

Sahaja Yogini: This is the problem in the West. Sometimes it is very difficult to keep the attention.

Sahaja Yogi: Why? Why? You must think like that, ìI am not meant to think for others. I am meant to think for myself, first of all. I must improve myself first of all. I cannot conquer the whole world. Nor can I improve all the world.î Gradually it will happen. So no more future planning. Slowly, but surely, you must think, ì I am going towards my goalî. Slowly but surely. In this manner, you can overcome this ego business and all the things. So don't behave with this ego just like your enemy and all the time you are quarreling with him.

I told you, behave like you would with a domestic animal. The dog is a domestic animal. How do you tame the dog? In the same manner, you must nourish your ego. It is essential. Supposing I have some habit. But if those habits are in my control, I can use these habits in good work also. Isn't it? After all, what do we have to achieve? We have to achieve our goal.

You must ride your ego. Ego is a horse and you are the rider. Be like that. Be a warrior. Take the sword of Sahaja Yoga in your hand and go on fighting. Ego is necessary. You should sit upon your horse. The horse should not sit upon you. That is what I mean to say. You must control your ego, just like you control the horse.

Another Sahaja Yogi: Very often we like to do it, but it doesn't work.

Sahaja Yogi: You will not allow the horse to sit upon your head. But when the horse is tired, you must feed him something. You must love your horse also. For the time being, you love your ego, just like you love your dog. And when he is too much angry, what do you do? You just put the chain in his neck. And tie him somewhere.
