I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
But you have to ask only for the Truth and nothing else.
Our idea about Truth is also based upon our concepts that we have got from somebody else. Also, it might be due to some sort of our ego-oriented concept that we have created ourselves.
But Truth is what it is and you cannot make it.
So, if I say to you something, you don’t have to blindly believe me. But now the time has come for you to experience the Truth. In your evolutionary process now, from amoeba stage to this stage, you have arrived, whatever you have achieved is felt on your central nervous system. But it has to admitted that human beings have not reached their complete stage. The purpose for which they were made human beings is not yet established, otherwise there would have been no problems of any kind. Maybe that, so far, it was not possible to manifest the Truth in an en-masse way. And maybe that there were only very few flowers that came on the Tree of Life till today. But nowadays, as you see, there are so many seekers and what are they seeking is the Truth.
First of all, you have to know that you cannot put in any effort for that. You cannot pay for it. The Divine does not understand money, nor you can conceive it, or you can preach about it; it has to happen to you. In this happening you have to feel the Truth. To feel the Truth the Divine has made all the instrument within us, as shown to you by Guido. But whether these things are within us or not, we are not sure of that. We also do not know whether we have a heart, we have a stomach and other organs in our body. Only when we get the pain, we become aware of them. But these are subtler chakras within us, subtler centres; to feel them we have to become subtler.
The ancient seers and masters, real ones, not the fake ones, all talked about it, Incarnations talked about it, that ‘you have to have your second birth’. That you are to be ‘born again’, is said in all the Scriptures. Many people who are not truthful and honest just certify themselves that ‘we are born again’, and miss the truth all their lives. So, one has to decide that we are going to be very honest and truthful about it and are not going to be guided by any concepts that we have had.
All these centres that you have seen are like milestones in our being. Now these milestones are there for our physical health, mental health, emotional life and for Spiritual life. When these centres get into a jeopardy then you find that there is a problem, either physical, emotional or spiritual or mental.
Now, there is a power within us which is the pure desire. We can say this is the power reflected within us, the power of the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost is the power of God. That means God as a Father and God as a Son we have, but what about the Mother for the Son? Without the Mother, how can you have the Son? So, this is the Primordial Mother, which is the Holy Ghost.
Now this Primordial Mother is reflected within you as the Kundalini, in the triangular bone which you see here. Now this Kundalini is your pure desire. All other desires are not pure so you never feel satisfied even when they are achieved. The pure desire is to become ‘one’ with the Divine. That is what the ‘seekers’ today, the special category of people, are ’seeking’.
All around us there is Divine Power which organises, which thinks, which manifests, which co-ordinates and which loves. It loves and in ‘love’ it knows what is to be done to give this living aspect of the Universe. We see the flowers, we see the fruits, we see everything happening; living process, but we take it for granted. So, the Divine is the ’living’ being so it has to be a ‘living’ process. Like the sprouting of the seed, when you put it in the Mother Earth it sprouts by itself. You cannot pay for it, you cannot order it, you cannot work it out. When you place the seed, it is built, within itself, all the maps that it is going to manifest. In the same way, within you, lies this instrument. In your heart resides the Spirit. Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty. When this Kundalini rises, spontaneously, She becomes one with the Spirit, here, because the seat of the Spirit is on top of your head. This is the real baptism where you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your own head. You feel completely relaxed and peaceful. You can feel this all over. But more than that you become a new personality with collective consciousness that you can feel another personality on your fingertips. You can feel the other chakras just on the fingertips, even the children can feel it.
Now, if you know how to somehow cure these chakras, then you are alright physically, mentally and emotionally and you have the blessings of the Truth, that you are the Spirit. Like a candle is enlightened by another enlightened candle, you can go on enlightening other people and it can reach the whole universe. But we cannot say that a light which is not yet enlightened, is enlightened unless and until there is light in it. The light has its own qualities; that it gives light, it can burn another light. So, the person who is supposed to be enlightened has to have self-knowledge because he can see himself in that light. Nobody has to guide; nobody has to tell him anything; he can see it clearly within himself what he is. And then you feel you are completely integrated. There is no quarrel between your head and your heart and your liver. You become a personality of great dynamism and magnetism. You don’t have to dress up to impress others. Nor you have to dress up to impress others in a way as if you are ‘enlightened’. You are satisfied with your own enlightenment and you enjoy it.
You become extremely dynamic but you look at the whole world as a play, as a witness. Normally, a thought rises and falls off, another thought rises and falls off, in between there is a little space. So, we live in the future or in the past but in the present we cannot stand. By our suggestion or all these methods, you cannot do it. Only when the Kundalini rises, She brings all the attention inside and pierces through your fontanelle bone area. You are paying attention to me but if I say pay attention inside, you cannot. But when you get your Realisation you see from inside out. And as you are detached from the problem you can solve it much better. As if you are in the water then you are afraid of the waves but when you get into a boat you see the waves and enjoy them. The complete transformation from within takes place and such a person becomes extremely confident of his power of love, as if you enter into paradise, all your tension goes away, all your worries goes away and you know the ways and methods of correcting the problems that face you.
This is what is promised to you also in the Bible, it is promised to you in Koran, it’s promised to you in all the scriptures that this is going to happen. So, as promised, it has to happen. And you all have to feel your Spirit. It is so simple and spontaneous. That’s called Sahaja meaning ‘born with you’. Yoga, union, to have the union with the Divine, is your right, as a human being, to have it. All the peace and joy is within you. People talk of ‘peace’ but they have no peace within. How can you have peace by talking?
This is the only solution for the emancipation of human beings, is to achieve their ‘Spirithood’. And this should happen to all of you today.
May God bless You.
Thank you very much.

Today we have started rather late, so we can’t have any questions, but you can write them down and tomorrow I’ll try to answer them.
Most of you will get your realisation today. Even some of you do not get it it doesn’t matter you will get them tomorrow. And those who have got it today will get it much more fixed tomorrow.
The only trouble in the West is that once they get their Realisation, they do not realise the seriousness of it, the importance of it and just they get lost with the joy that they have. But you have to know that we have lots of problems and even when the Kundalini pierces through our head, again She goes back to treat all the organs which are suffering within us. It also goes to all the weaknesses that we have in our being.
Now, we have to learn to make Her stabilise herself by co-operating with Her. For that you have to come to a collective programme where you meet everyone. I meet people who got Realisation about, say, six years back and again they come to me and saying that, ‘Mother, I’m suffering from this trouble and that trouble.’ You have to know all about it and how to look after other people. In short you have to be a master of yourself and for others. Once it is established then you can manifest it and, the same way, you can raise the Kundalini of thousands of people and give them give the Realisation. This is God’s work and is to be done with full respect to yourself that you are the instrument of God. The energy just flows. You need not even touch the person, even looking at the person you can help another personality to rise.
So far, we have never used the power of love, only used the power of hatred. The power of love is the highest and the most dynamic and you will be amazed to see how fantastic you are when you are put to the mains, like this instrument which is all ready (the microphone), but if you don’t put to the mains it has no meaning. In the same way you are all made very beautifully and with great care.
Please do not judge yourself, do not condemn yourself, and do not feel unworthy by any chance. It does not matter in what race, in what caste, in what community you are born. All of you can get your Realisation.
So, let us now come to the point of getting Realisation.
You just have to take out your shoes to help the Mother Earth to suck in the problems.
Those who don’t want it should go away, it cannot be forced.

Now, it’s very simple, as I told you. Sahaja also means simple in our language.
So, you have to sit very comfortably, in a straight way, with both the feet parallel to each other, separated.
Both the hands towards Me.
Now I have to request you to forgive yourselves completely. You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. And not to feel guilty at all.
You can put your hands on your lap comfortably, if you want to.
Now, we will be working on our chakras ourselves to help the Kundalini to rise.
First of all, we’ll put our right hand on the heart. Here is the residence of our Spirit.
Then we’ll put our right hand on the upper part of the stomach, on the left-hand side.
All the time left hand should be towards me and we work our right hand on the left-hand side.
Now this right hand is to be taken below in the lower abdomen on the left-hand side again and pressed hard.
Then we have to take it back on to the upper part of our abdomen.
Then this hand has to go to the heart again.
Then this hand goes in the corner of the neck and the shoulder. Should be done from the front, not from the back, and turn your head to the right.
Then this hand has to go on the forehead and press it like that, and press it hard on both the sides.
Then this hand goes on the back of the head and you have to look up, resting your head on your hand.
Now you have to stretch your hand, like this, on top of your head and put the centre of your hand on top of the fontanelle bone area which was a soft bone as a child.
Just stretch your fingers to press your palm on top of your scalp and move it slowly, seven times.
That’s all.

Now you all have to close your eyes and not open them until I tell you.
There is no mesmerism in Sahaja Yoga.
Please take out your spectacles because it helps the eyesight also. And if you are uncomfortable here or in the neck anywhere, make it loose and sit comfortably.
It will take, hardly, five to ten minutes.

Now, put your left hand towards Me and close your eyes.
Now, right hand you put it on the heart.
Now, here you close your eyes.
Now, in the heart resides the Spirit. So, you ask me a very fundamental question. You can call me Mother or Shri Mataji. ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’ Please ask three times.
Now, please ask this fundamental question. ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’
Now, take down your hand onto the left-hand side of the upper part of your abdomen and don’t open your eyes.
This is the centre of your mastery. As you are the Spirit, you can ask the second question, ‘Mother, am I my own master, am I my own guide, am I my own guru?’ Three times.
Now, place your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. Here is the centre which caters, or gives you, the pure knowledge how to handle the Divine Power.
Now, you are free to choose, I cannot force on you, so you have to ask, ‘Mother, please give me pure knowledge.’
Now, when you say that six times your kundalini will start rising because this centre has six petals.
‘Please give me the true knowledge.’
Now to help the Kundalini to rise, have self confidence within you.
Raise your right hand again on the upper part of the abdomen, on the left-hand side, and press it hard.
At this centre, which is the centre of the master, with full confidence, you have to say, ‘Mother, I am my own master.’ With full confidence, please say it ten times.
Now, say it with full confidence, without any diffidence about yourself; you are your own masters.
Now, raise your right hand to your heart again. Where resides the Spirit. Now with full confidence you have to say, ‘Mother, I am the Spirit.’ This is the truth.
Please say it twelve times, that, ‘Mother I am the Spirit,’ With full confidence in yourself.
We have to know that God Almighty is the ocean of love and compassion. Above all He is the ocean of forgiveness and you cannot do anything that He cannot forgive. So, you have to forgive yourself and feel confident and be pleasantly placed towards yourself.
Now, raise your hand to your neck between the corner that is formed by your head and by your shoulder. Hold it tight and turn your head to the right. Now, here you have to say (take it from the front not from the back, as I have told you, take it across, right hand, right hand, not the left hand, not the left hand, right hand).
Now here you have to say sixteen times, ‘Mataji, or Mother, I am not guilty at all.’ If you still feel guilty you can say it, to punish yourself, 108 times!
At the very outset I said that you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourselves. Sixteen times please say, ‘Mother I am not guilty at all.’ By turning your head to the right.
Now, raise your hand to your forehead, please. Here you have to say, ‘Mother I forgive everyone with all my heart, how many times is not the point, you have to say it from your heart. It is a myth that you think that you cannot forgive. You do not forgive anyone nor can you say that,’ I forgive’ but if you do not forgive you play into wrong hands.
Now, put your hand on the back side of your head and put it back, your head, resting on your hand and looking upward. Now here we have to just say, ‘Oh Divine, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me’, for your own satisfaction. Push back your head.
Now raise your hand and stretch your palm. Put the centre of your palm on top of the centre of your head, the soft bone called the fontanelle bone. Press it hard. Stretch your fingers. Move it slowly seven times. Here again, I cannot cross over freedom so you have to say, ‘Please, Mother, give me Self Realisation.’ I can’t force on you.
Now please take down your hands.
Slowly open your eyes, please.
Put both the hands towards Me. (Little raising)
Now, put your left hand on top of your head about four, five inches, can be a little higher, there should be a cool breeze coming in.
Right hand towards Me. Yes.
Now, turn it round and press your left hand towards me and see with the right hand.
Move it a little and see if there is a cool breeze coming in, or maybe some people feel heat.
Again, once again, put the right hand towards Me and see with the left hand.
Now put both your hands to the sky and push back your head and ask a question, ‘Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?’, ‘Is this the all-pervading power of God’s love?’ ‘Is this the living power of Brahma?’
Now put down your hands and see for yourself. Do you feel the cool breeze in your hands?
You can also feel it in this way.
Doesn’t matter if some people don’t feel it in the hands, or may feel in one hand, doesn’t matter.
Now, all those who have felt it in the head or in the hands, please raise both the hands.
Raise your both the hands.
So many of them have got it!
May God bless you all
And everybody’s going to get it!
Now you cannot think about it, don’t discuss about it, don’t think about it, just go and enjoy a nice deep sleep.
Thank you very much. I hope to see you all tomorrow with all your friends, with all your neighbours.
