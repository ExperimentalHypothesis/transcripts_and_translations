Has to be taken up otherwise I tell you. Some of you will start looking like orange z or. Genghis Khan. For Hitler. Or something like that, see, all these, you suddenly I find among suchies some Hitler standing with the moustache and the hair like that, the nose like that. But suddenly I find someone like that. It's quite possible. I mean what I have seen of Sergio guy in the west, I'm surprised to see. You leave somebody as a little sparrow, and when you come back, you find a hawk. That the same person.

Yes, now she's become aha. Only possible in the west, I can tell you. If you tell somebody in India, they will not believe. Like Mister Jekyll and Mister Hyde, only possible in the West. When I read this story, I said, how can it be possible. Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I said, how can it be possible? But I've seen it. It happens here They, when they are good, they're very, very good, and when they're bad, they're horrid. But that's only in the West. You don't find this in India.

Why? The reason is we are deep. Into ourselves really deep. All right, you have not missed anything now. Because you got your realisation as they've got it, you've got the knowledge of surgery as they've got it. But test it upon yourself. And humble down yourself. Go down into yourself facing yourself. Just telling yourself, no, I have to agree deeper and deeper. I'm not going to listen to anything.

Ego and all that nonsense. I'm not going to listen. I'm going to go deeper into. And move into yourself, ed yourself into reality. Piercing through all these ego or nonsensical ideas that come. Then only you can correct it, otherwise you can. The best way in meditation I've seen to improve your ego is to meditate on my feet. My feet Have that magic. Have you got photographs of my feet? I don't find anything here.

Yes ma'am. That's good. Mm Great Yes we have Is he here, Edward. Canadian I Some people couldn't come through much as you lack of space in that sense. He's so tall as 6 ft. Oh, What's the meaning of tardy. late A person who's always late, like me. You have a different way of doing it a different purpose. Distracted Often distracted, that attention is easily taken away from. Daydreaming. It's.

Is he? He's improved. Laurie Hynes, uh, person, he's in the ashram there in, in Vancouver, but he's had an up and down history. So we'll find it somebody. It's very good. Godfrey in San Diego. point She has children. Uh, yes, ma'am. Is he here? No.

Again another case of vaccine. They uh With saving to go to India. Mm And I think the difference between flying here and there may make. may make the difference whether you can go to India. So they didn't know you were gonna be here, mother. At first it was Warren and they, Warren was gonna go to their San Diego. Christine. We have done Janet Bows. Jeannette. the Oh good.

Hm. They're all filmmakers here. She she brought them, uh, Phil and Christine and all these other filmmakers from the department where she works for. Now what's that. Christine, could you Good If you have gone to sleep. Left sided feet. Yes, a very good person extremely. 30 years of age. For some streets. Elizabeth And she's she said, yes, I met her.

I know I don't her. She has children. Uh, no, mother, she's never been married. I Hm. Caroline, I would like to marry. Did you hear that? I said, I would like to marry you now. Myself. We are so good. Ah, that's so good.

divorced. To You divorced and he divorced. Is he married? huh? Mm, does he? Not bad. I don't want to give you another chance. How do you find him? Be Why not try Sergio. Mm.

Better try because I am saying your children must be missing the father. Oh, they have their they have grown up, huh. 25 and 23 years old in professions of their own. They're all working professionally in fields, economics. Father. Why not try him again, all right? I have a feeling he's a good man. He may come to search you. All right, that would be a unique thing. You know my ego No, it's not that.

I think Now you are very. Right, try. So That would be the best. I'll be very happy because it's, it's a new precedent for people to show that those who are divorced again can remarry because after realisation, a person gets completely transformed. I start seeing the beauty of another person with a different rank. I And all the hurts and all those past things are. Hm. Lee. Yeah, OK, yeah. Yeah.

But only in India is possible, Warren, what he said. Be a master like this just falling at my feet like that, only in India. Ah Steve In 4 notes she took all that in 4 notes. I think all of you should learn little Indian music. It gives you a basic understanding of music as it is. Right. I Oh This song, he must have sung at least 100 times. Every time a different time. But Bagoujana. It was without any shrada.

How how is the emotions? There are no emotions in it, then how will you go? Beyond the Maasagara, beyond the ocean of Iluja. Oh Saba is all Kare is do. We all do pilgrimage or the Deva Puja, and not thee with the heart. But Watson on our money. Was, but the greed and the dust doesn't die. So what's the use? How will you cross the illusion? Just going to pilgrimages and worshipping God.

Whenever I speak, you people catch on left to Shudi. That's very bad. I didn't say anything like that. I was making you laugh all the time. That's also bootish, I think, isn't it, to catch on to such points. My God. Might be cabiras Kabiras. He says that you, they wash themselves very well in India, especially, you see, they wash their body very well, they wash everything very well. What about inside is not washed. Should be the other way down, you see.

Where can you take out vibrations. You have to see this too much. Can you put it here, this side, the light. The Beautiful. Such big ones I've not seen before. What's that? huh? I settle down with the 2nd 1. Yes. Yes, it's very much.

Is uh icement so. And everything becomes uh in the EPS stage you start seeing everything in the week. No I understand. You know, The one in Pandarpura. All in all Maharashtras are devoted to Pandavpur because according to them, Shri Krishna came and stayed there. So the one who stayed in Pandarina. Where there's my friend. Loose secret stuff. He sang this to you on your birthday celebration. He sang this to you on your birthday celebration.

It's different now, and much better. Yeah. Yeah. Why Yeah. Oh Kagaga. F No. I At least sugar would be good because of that. Or some Diet Coke. All right. Have you got Diet Coke.

It's burning. See, I don't eat very hot things. Normally Indians like it, but not me. That's good. So don't. See Left suggest is a permanent cat, left aria. cat Left Adler. Take it off. Is the la la. Khawari Supporter.

Sar supporter picture up. It takes the sides of these takes the sides of the bas. Stands by. To Where are you taking your house? In a place called Mount Vernon. It's just not. It's away from here it's far away. Too far away. Good, not that it's closer, much closer than. Chihuahua.

A one spoon with. What Wow. No. Combination of left left yeah yes this is. My daughter's little baby is sucking that one all the time. All the time Yeah Uh just. Ragbalubalungale changing ragas. Poor May's baby. I think children must be catching from you all, that's why they don't want to sit in the. I on the surgery.

You're looking better. Except for Collectivity Yes. He Well Make tan. He's saying that, Krishna, you have paid the debts of many before. Bo ourselves many. Wow. It. Michael, what are you doing? What work? Same thing.

We're installing telecommunications. stolen telephone Sophisticated tele for Better restore yourself also. A guy's terrible. Fundalini doesn't go above this. I think the telephone system between you and God is not all right. Better put it right, I guess too much. Watch me. Put your left to the right, because when we work very hard our raga catches. Put left to the right 7 times. All of you should cry.

No Cing what a year. To correct And one should not be angry with him, I think. In England they behave very well. He's here to because he knows a lot about Sergio, to teach you about Sergio. You must have knowledge of surgery. That's very important. Because if you don't have the knowledge, you see, the people don't feel impressed by you. You must know it. Left Christi left right at the mother. Don't get to the left, that's your weakness.

Ah, How much air on it nonstop. It's getting more intense, not less. Left. Re Little her. Lu. Right, yeah. Now you see how your mother has to suffer. You must all keep yourself clean, practise a yoga, meditate every day, and try to meet one as far as possible. That all creates problems. Get enough.

You must meet everyone, you see. That stopped. Try to meet as many as possible. I stopped. I've got pain in your head. I've got a headache? I have, huh, it's gone up here. Rub it, rub it a little bit. We face yourself, you see, why do you develop an aria? Develop it because you think you're doing the work.

Ah, Wow Not better on the left. Now getting better on the left. It's getting better on the left. Co He. Well, Come on Kaylara. Lela. He says who is a. You, you have uh uh You have paid off the debts of so many before. Now who is going to pay off our debts? Because Sri Krishna is also Kubera, it's the one.

Who is the giver of wealth. Lit Mm Hm. Wow. Not to feel guilty is very wrong way attitude. Face it, Actually I, I get deaf sometimes the way you people see it. The doctor has given me a earphone. A We should leave. We should leave. I better get my case. Christine, I wanted to tell you about this, uh, programme of going to India.

I think, but you are, uh, compiling all the names and everything you now. And uh the list has not gone of marriages, uh, which must be sent immediately to go. I wanted you to see it first. Wanted me to see it. We'll see that together there would be better. Have you got it now? All right, in your room. So I'll see that and I'll see the people. That's one thing. Secondly, And the circular I hope to have written that he shouldn't bring too many clothes there.

Those who want to have saris, we will get 3 saris and 3 blouses and 3 petticoats. Ready for them if they write it down. Have you written down like that? Yes, they have, they have it in the measurements as well. All right, so. Anybody who hasn't given me their measurements, I think most of you have. Make sure you give me it today. Also for men, if you give us your measurements, we'll get your kurta and pyjamas ready in time, we will not be in Bombay. For some time. I think we'll never be in Bombay till you come back, so no question.

Now about money, how much have you sent? Is 180 sent sent all of their money. Everyone should have all of their money. Yes, all of it. Everyone sent their deposit, but most people have paid all of the money. The only thing they have to pay is the airfare, and that they have to pay to Babet. that's different. That's. All that money should be paid. Now about luggage.

Again I say don't carry too much, but you must carry. Some sort of a foam thing, about 2 to 3 inches. That Quite light. Or in your sleeping bag. That is something you have to donate to Indians. It's very important. 4 thick as that rubber or 4, whatever you can get. Rubber would be expensive. No, they better buy whatever you can get. Then rubber is better.

For Indian climate travel is better, about 3 inches. It is covered with some sort of a sheet or something I think 3 inches 3 inches thick might be quite a heavy one. No, no, not heavy. It is not. They are not carrying too much luggage. Everybody can carry one as I meant for the buses. I mean for the buses. No, no, not for buses. No, no, no problem. No problem for buses.

I can get something else like a truck or something, you know, but the amount I have to pay, you know, what happens when you get anything from the people. They give you these, uh, what do you call this mattresses there. And I don't know. Some people carelessly use that, and you have to pay for the whole price of the whole thing, and then it really tells upon us. Uh sometimes 50, sometimes 60 is too much. So it's better you bring your own once for all, and we'll manage it because we can always use that. Well, man, don't you worry. I don't mind paying for that. But the lord and all, but in any case, if you don't read too many things. Why don't you bring a small suitcase with a few things in it, whatever you need, because Indian soaps are better than here.

Indian toothpastes are better than here. Everything is better than here at the most the brush you might bring toothbrush. A person walking out with a toothbrush is the best. I mean, combs, we get better. Whatever you need, you tell us. We get you everything soaps. So we get beautiful soaps in India. I use always Indian soaps. Sandroot soaps are beautiful. They're so nice for the skin and so good compared to all your expensive things.

Washing your hair, don't carry your shampoos. We have there very good chica eyes and all that. Use them for a change, you see. They'll make your hair look better. They'll grow better, you'll like it. Anything like that you want, we can get you. And it's not much to pay also. Under clothes, if you want to take, you can take it otherwise if you give us sizes, we'll get you under clothes also. Pure cotton under clothes are very, very cheap in India. So don't carry too many things.

There's no need to carry. Because whatever you get here is very uncomfortable to me at least because everything is mixed with this nylon, this that you put your foot anywhere, it's nylon, do anything, it is nylon, so it's not comfortable for a surgery. And even your soaps are some horrible chemicals, you see. I mean, I just cannot use some of the soaps you have like cam. I don't know what goes wrong with it. So many of them this then this uh milkafulai or something that to life business I cannot. Just gives me rush. Now what else is to be carried like that? Just the suit they go there with just one suit of clothes what they're wearing and 2 will do 2 will do, but that suits, suit only 1 at the most. I mean, where will you get to the suits?

You just wear these kurta pyjamas. That's the best there. Was the use of wearing a suit in that heat to get all the boils on the body? Maybe a jacket or some sweater sweater, sweater. Don't sweater. Sweater is sufficient for India. Don't have to carry goats and raincoats and umbrellas. There's no need. So, they virtually need to carry virtually no luggage. Virtually they'll be wearing most of it when they go when you can't wear kurtas, no journey from here they have virtually nothing with them just an empty bag if somebody has got a kura they may like to take it, you see, but you can buy two kurtas for yourself.

It's a good idea. They buy, they normally buy about 4 or 545 silks because the last time we went there we couldn't get silk ones till the very last one we'll have to, but if you give me sizes of this type of, I don't know what they call them. What is that half half half pyjama pyjamas. They're not and they're not pyjamas. They're, they're half pyjamas. At the most you can bring long johns. Yeah I mean, if you, you won't find it so cold. I don't know what you can bring razors, maybe. But where do you use the electric lasers? No, battery operated ones, you used the whole journey or a battery ones.

All right. How big batteries, the kind of battery you bought for me. That's a good one. Bring those kinds. The battery is good. That's a good idea. battery. What else? The batteries self-charging ones you're talking about, the ones you thought were good. You just plug them in and they charge up plug you won't get.

Better bring where you can put the batteries. Yeah, we didn't we bring batteries that no, no, batteries that can be plugged or battery right both ways. One everybody must have a battery. It's very good. What is. We'll get your oils. Everything We'll get you oils, combs, huh, chapels you'll get there tooth, toothbrush you must bring because I don't know. Indians are not very good at toothbrushes. We use, you see, the other thing, Indians thing which you may not like, but it's very good for the teeth. Maybe toothpaste if you are fond of any one of them.

I don't know what else can you bring. Do they need Ashley's suitcases or soft bag, you know, big soft bag. Why? Well, in case you want to bring something back. No, no, then you see, you should buy one in India. Why don't you buy one leather one there? We'll order. They'll give you a very nice leather soft box about. Oh yes. Why don't you get a pure leather?

These horrible soft ones here, they go give way in no time. They'll give a nice one with a lock and everything. Pure leather. How many for that? Raise your hands. Those who are going one pure leather thing, those who are going to be there. It's good. Christine, why don't you come? I'd love to if we could afford it, but I don't know if it'll be possible she wanted because of the house, because of the house purchase. He's there.

What is he going to do? Let him do the house. What are you going to do with the house? The money, the money. What's the money we need her salary for the, well, not just that, no, whether we'll have enough to pay for the trip. It's. I mean, what a house you're buying like that. What's the use of such a big house? What are you going to do with it? Well, maybe some people would come and live with us.

Savis then it's so. Um, they can be. If those surgeries you want to stay with you can pay because I think it's a long time you have not been. Yes it is, but people have been asking me why Christina has not come with such an old surgery, Winnie, like you said they remember this time Pat all this old group is going, so I think you should make it. Yes, she let her come. Actually, he also must, but you can go halfway. He can come halfway because Aga is terrible and surgeries will get after you, the Indian surgeries. They'll give you a nice massage. I can see that as soon as you come, they'll jump on you. Be prepared Michaela.

Terrible. I tell you it's numbing. It's very bad. Hold it. It's terrible. Hold it. Just imagine beside you, beside that. Better now. This is steady. To.

I should get dressed. I should get dressed. I should get dressed. Who can do that again. It's too much. safe I did quite a lot. It seems never ending. Little tiny bit of sugar, mother, teeny little bit of sugar, a little bit. A little bit. Yeah That's the way Man the Not him.

No, no. It's such a lot. I just want to do it so they all clear out. So I can clear out myself, but what's the use? Should they put their left hand to you, Mother, right hand on the earth, right hand on the earth, left hand to you. Well, this is all right. See, always remember that positive goes to negative, you see, so the connection is established. So on the left hand side, if you're working, then you have the right hand and left hand takes it up, put your left hand and you'll see the difference. Lucky. Oh Sucking it, yeah, sucking.

See, nothing is happening. I mean, I'm sucking it. I'm sorry, I'm sucking it. No, just see the other one. I see. So they're different. Just, just like electrical charge. Same laws. Salo. All right, OK.

Still there, still there. I'll do it in the car. I hope you're better now, are you? I'll have to hold my ears now because I must have said something. Yeah. I just don't know. Such a lot of catch on the left we it was terrible. Too much. No, too much that you should have to pull your ears. I mean, it comes to that then what to do.

It's just I don't think they can handle you being angry. Guilty actually don't receive anything, what I'm saying. Not to feel guilty. What is that? I'm not saying it to you because if you are the spirit, I'm not telling it to you, but to something else that is not you. OK, cool. Yeah, the spitting. So how are you? That's good. And what about you?

Where are those three lost souls? Lost forever. Horrible there. What their addresses? Sam LA 2 from LA and one from um. Monterey San Francisco area. See, now if you go after them, their ego will be pampered, as it is that too much ego. They don't mind living here as it is, taking drugs, doing all kinds of things. Also to say this is too much is also ego's expression, I think, isn't it? Too much forego only.

Oh All right, it's good. I love this. Still, the right I guess too much is impossible. Pull it out. I did change. God bless you. This kind of a thing do you want the one that's it exactly same tight, tight bottoms, not the big baggy ones. Oh That one is uh this char. Not very tight also. Yes, there are some which were very tight and they were no good.

They split every time you sat down, and there's another type which is too baggy. They don't look nice. You look like you're, yes, they look like you're going to bed. You don't look like you're doing Puja. And the other type is this type is very smart and it's nice. You have to look elegant. For you, I don't know this this one too. Nobody who is younger than 12 years is coming, isn't it? That's right. Jacqueline Jacqueline Jacqueline is what is her age?

But she's quite mature for her age. Jacqueline is quite. Your daughter is uh quite sensible right now she's all right. She's a lot better. She's very sensible for her. Yes, up to that we can have, say 10 years, we should put about 10 years. Very small children going to be difficult. Better. All right. I'll see, I'll be seeing this lawyer with a muddled head.

He liked me because I'm quite confused. He'd be totally confused by the time you're French. All right. May God bless you. Enjoy yourself now. Enjoy. I don't talk too much. Don't talk too much. That's not necessary. Just enjoy a little bit.

Talk something nice to each other. Be nice, kind, but all the time, talk, talk, talk, talk, you know, one goes mad. They have some tapes, listen to tapes. That's better is better. A sing is better than talking, I think. Hello Sri Mahakali matajiri and Mala Devi. Just get up. What's the what. Thank you so much. Now that's more the collection so we understand.
