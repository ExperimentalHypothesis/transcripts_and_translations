宽恕轮 Agnya Chakra

1983年2月3日 印度德里

今天我们要了解宽恕轮,这个轮穴在视神经交叉的位置。眼部神经在后面相反方向交叉,那交叉的位置便是宽恕轮的所在。通过延髓,宽恕轮与其他中心有着连系。宽恕轮有两块花瓣。这个微妙的中心在前面作用于眼睛,在后面作用于脑后突出的部位。这便是此轮穴身体方面的特性。有些人说人有第三眼,宽恕轮便是第三眼。我们有两只眼睛,能够看见事物,同时我们还有此微妙的第三眼。如果你看见这只眼睛,那表示你其实离开了它。例如,如果你看见自己的眼睛,那表示你是看见镜中的反映,不是真实。如果你看见甚么,那表示你是在观看它。因此有些人吃了迷幻药,说看见另一只眼。他们只是看见,但却以为自己的第三眼已经打开了。其实你是离开很远的,此所以你能够看见它。你要么跑到右边的超意识去,要么跑到左边的潜意识去,都能看见那第三眼。但在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你却是通过那第三眼来观看。就好像一个窗户,你可以看见那个窗户,但如果你通过那个窗户去观看,你便看不见那窗户。因此有些人说看见第三眼,以为灵量已经升起来了,他们其实是大错特错。

宽恕轮是个狭窄的通道,一般情况下注意力不能通过,一般情况下,那是没有可能的。那通道很狭窄,因为「自我」和「超我」互相接合,封闭了通道,于是没有空隙可容灵量通过。超我与自我下面是喉轮,自喉轮一直绕上来。因此你们看见自我和超我在这个位置。它们由喉轮开始,一直到达宽恕轮的位置,然后交叉。因此你们左边有问题,会表现在右边。右手从这里开始直达这边,左手则从这里开始。但左手其实作用于右边。

因此我们要通过或进入那第三眼,这要靠提升灵量才能做到。但这个到达大脑边缘系统,即天国的门户,是很狭窄的。因此如果有人强把注意力进入那封闭的门户,他不是去了左边,便是右边。这样便引生许多麻烦,因为那些人不知道,那些不可知的领域不是属神的。因此当他们移向右边,便进入了超意识界,开始看见幻象。其实那些都不是幻象,而是存在于右边的真实事物,那些人其实是看见属于右边的事物。他们可能看见色彩,可能看见死去的人物,特别是那些自我很强的人物,他们能看见干闼婆(Gandharwas)和紧那罗(Kinnaras),因为他们进入了右边的干闼婆界,开始看见超意识界中的事物。但这样做是很危险的,因为如果那里有谁逮住你,便有一个附加人格坐在你头上,你在自我处被附了身,变得自以为是,行为恶毒。希特勒便是一个例子,他跟随西藏的喇嘛学习如何进入超意识界,学会了以后便使无数的人变得自我中心,同时进入超意识界。你们也许也听说过那些喇嘛,他们能够知道未来,例如谁是下一任的喇嘛,到那里去找他等等。他们知道许多未来的事情,人们便以为是属于上天的。知道未来不是属于上天的。那是我们不应进入的领域,因为那表示不平衡。我们是人类,我们要知道「现在」,不是「将来」。一旦你们通过现在这个阶段,便能上升至一个高度,可以看见过去、现在和将来。就好像在大地上,如果你能找到一个高处,你便能看见已走过的,和要来到的,这样你便能在现在之中。同样,如果一个人在现实中升进,到达超越的意识,他便能看见右边的超意识和左边的潜意识,但他会对两者都没有兴趣,他只希望在现在之中升进,这其实便是提升灵量所要做的。

因此所有那些说提升灵量是很难很危险的,他们都是没有获得授权去提升灵量的人。他们只是弄些甚么把戏,刺激交感神经系统,使左右交感神经从中脉抽取能量,造成中脉衰竭,而使那个人的精神系统破坏。因此那些说以这个方法那个方法提升灵量的人,其实是扼杀了求道者的生命。最后那些求道者会一无所得。没有人知道可以得到甚么,因为他们被带入了歧途。

但逻辑上我们应该了解,练习以后,至低限度我们的健康要良好,精神应比从前更好才对,同时你们的脾性要有所改善,这是最低限度的。但如果你的钱全都给导师拿去,追求那些无意义的经验,结果损害了健康,甚至不能主宰自己,那你们应该知道,这些都不是真实。在真实之中,你应该能够主宰自己。如果你被别的东西控制,那你便是迷失了。例如,有些人不停的跳。他们说:「母亲,我不停自动的跳。」这情况其实很严重,那表示你不能控制自己,那是有别人在你里面使你不停的跳。那不是「你」在跳。你的注意力和意识都在别人控制之下,以致不能控制自己。所以所有那些空中飞行或灵界旅行,看见种种事物等,都是非常危险的,这个人最后可能会进入精神病院,因为他完全不能控制自己。

在美国,他们称这些为超心理学(para-psychology)的实验。当然这些是超越个人的心灵的,但却十分危险。你们不应走进那个领域,要是有甚么亡灵逮住你,你便行为怪异。大概十二年前,有一些美国人来见我,说:「母亲,请教我们如何在空中飞行。」我说:「为甚么?你们不是有飞机了么?」他们说:「不,我们要在空中飞行。」我说为甚么?他们说:「因为俄国正做那些超心理学的实验,我们也要照样做。」我说那些人会被亡灵附体,结束自己。我说我不会教这些东西。如果那些俄国人来见我,我也会这样说。但那些美国人还是说:「不,我们还是要学。」我说,如果我告诉你,你便会变成那些亡灵的奴隶,不停的抖颤。尽管如此,他们还是说:「即使这样,我们还是要学。」他们说俄国人做的,他们也要做。最后我问谁介绍他们来的,他们说了一位先生的名字,他是孟买的一名记者。我告诉他们这位先生从前正是患上我刚才所说的问题。他经常离开身体,进入另一个世界,东看西看,最后他完全不能主宰自己,后来我治好了他。但他竟然以为我既然能治,就一定能令人进入那个状态。我治好他的病,为甚么你们却要得到他的病,他们执意如此。最后我才发现,他们在美国开有利用超心理学赚钱的生意,这是极端危险的事情。

这是因为运动的方向不是通过宽恕轮,而是移向左边或右边,即潜意识和超意识。其后果可能不同,但在霎哈嘉看来,都是一样的。那些进入潜意识界的人可能看见我别的形相,好像那些吃迷幻药的不能看见我,只看见光。而那些进入潜意识的,他们会看见一些形相和事情,他们以为是到达了天国,其实他看见的是进化过程中的过去,那是过去的一切。因此超意识界和潜意识界都是十分危险的。因为如果注意力移向左边,便会产生癌症那类不治之症。因此要小心,不要到那些术师那里去,他们会控制你,或告诉你一些关于过去或未来的事物。

我们毋须知道过去或未来,有甚么需要知道呢?知道了有甚么作用呢?好像我告诉你我是怎样来到会场的,途中有交通阻塞等等,你会有兴趣听么?你们为何会对过去有兴趣?那对今天甚么价值也没有。可是那是人类的一个弱点,他们总要在自己的人格上附加上一些极端人为,并不真正存在,或是毫无价值的东西,然后说,我能做这,能做那。

在印度一般人都走向宽恕轮左边,因为他崇拜神。他们要崇拜神,但却与神没有联系。就好像我没有连接这个麦克风,便不能向你们说话一样。但他们没有联系,却去崇拜神,唱各种崇拜歌,行禁食,折磨自己。他们是走向左边的人,爱高唱赞歌等等,甚至二十四小时不停。这样,亡灵便把他们吸向左边。

又如他们不断念诵罗摩的口诀。也许你们说蚁蛭仙人(Valmiki)就是这样念诵的,但是谁叫他这样的?是Narada。Narada是降世神祇。你们自己或任何人可以教别人这样诵神的名字吗?无论你们念甚么名字,都不能达到神。你们到了那里?你们会到了另外某处,那里可能有个仆人叫罗摩,于是他便会逮住你,而你会变得行为怪异,像个疯癫的人。

至于超意识那边,有些野心很大的人,他们陷入疯狂,毫不考虑集体,只想到自己。出了问题时,我们也很难说服那些受害者,让他们知道走错了路,直到他们彻底完结为止。

宽恕轮是天国的门户,是每个人都要通过的。耶稣基督便是在这个轮穴之上。在印度的经典中,祂叫摩诃毗湿奴(Mahavishnu),是罗陀(Radha)之子。祂的本质是由十一个毁灭力量(Ekadasha Rudrus)构成。但最主要的本质却是格涅沙的纯真。因此祂是纯真的化身。纯真的意思是完全的纯洁。祂的身体不是由大地之母造的,因此祂的身体不会毁坏,祂是唵(Omkara),因此祂死后能够复活。祂是罗陀之子,你们很容易便能看见祂和其他神祇的关系,在Devi Bhagvat一书,便有摩诃毗湿奴的记载。

可是谁会读这本书呢,没有人有时间读这本书。他们只读那些没有用的书,读那些书,你们不能找到关于降世神祇的知识。因此要明白耶稣基督,你们要读Devi Bhagvat。可是如果我们向基督徒这样说,他们根本不会听,因为对他们来说,圣经是最后的根据。这怎么可能呢?因为圣经中所记载的,只是耶稣一生中的四年。在其他书中,也应该是有提到祂的。因此我们要张开眼睛看那些书,然后自己去判断那是否真理。但他们欲成立有组织宗教,所以他们说:「只是这样。」没有其他。因为如果有其他,他们的组织便会瓦解。可是事实不如他们所想那样。

因为Devi Bhagvat一书曾清楚地描述耶稣。灵量可以帮助我们证明这点。当灵量升起,停在宽恕轮,你们要念诵主祷文,否则宽恕轮便不会打开。你们要唤醒耶稣基督,否则便不会打开。你们要念诵祂的名字,否则宽恕轮不会打开,这证明耶稣基督是主宰这个轮穴的。甚至你们念诵摩诃毗湿奴的名字,宽恕轮也会打开。因此你们要正视这些证据。只是你们想拥有耶稣基督,才会否定他人,视他人为异端。你们是大错特错了。

每一部经典都有人去窜改它。每一部经典都是这样。我可以告诉你们薄伽梵歌的情况,他们把错误的饮食观念放进去,那是与科学违反的。说倾向答摩的人是吃肉的,那根本不对。因为吃蛋白质的人应自动变成倾向剌阇的人才对。因此这部分是人们根据他们的需要改动过的。但开头的部分没有改动。在开头部分,克里希纳说:「是你杀那些人吗?其实我已经把他们杀了,你还可以杀谁?」是那些婆罗门把经文改掉的。

至于在圣经,错误由保罗开始。保罗这人和耶稣没有任何关系,但却进入了圣经。我不明白为何保罗会在圣经之中。他只是个倾向超意识的罗马士兵,而且是个很坏的士兵,曾杀害过许多基督徒。但忽然间人们把保罗当作圣徒列入圣经,而且为世界各地接受,但如果你读他写的章节,便会知道他根本不是个得到自觉的灵。他是从超意识说话的,他是一副组织机器,一无是处。使徒行传是他写的,在使徒行传,保罗把耶稣的门徒描绘成像被鬼附的人那般,完全是倾向于超意识的人,他们行为怪异,以致被视为癫狂。你们可想象耶稣的门徒是这样的吗?但如果你是基督徒,却须把这一切生吞活剥,因为那是在圣经之中的。但如果你是个天生自觉的灵,便会怀疑这些废话。你会问:「谁是这个保罗?他是从那里跑出来的?」因为保罗所说的和耶稣基督所说的不同。

现在时候已经来临了,我们要知道所有宗教都是同一的。所有宗教都是同一生命河流的部分。所有那些降世神祇都是互相支持,互相滋养,互相照顾的。祂们之间完全合拍。你不可能看见祂们互相反对。当然这一点也是要证明的。只有提升灵量,我们才能证明这一点。如果你是得到自觉的灵,同时能提升别人的灵量,你会惊奇所有的神祇都在我们不同轮穴之中,我们要逐一唤醒他们。有时候,我在印度谈耶稣基督时,人们便谴责我,说我在传播基督教。但如果我在英国谈克里希纳,人们便谴责我传播印度教。现在我要告诉你们,是罗陀创造耶稣的。你们看耶稣,祂竖起两只手指[食指、中指],像这样。一只表示克里希纳,一只表示毗湿奴。耶稣曾说「天父」,那么谁是耶稣的父亲?是毗湿奴,即克里希纳。因为经上是这样描述摩诃毗湿奴的。经上说克里希纳自己也崇拜他的儿子,并说:「你将成为宇宙的支持,同时无论谁崇拜我,崇拜之果都会到你那里去」。克里希纳把耶稣基督放得比自己还要高,你们也可以看见摩诃毗湿奴的轮穴在喉轮之上,祂是每个人都要通过的门户。克里希纳祝福自己的儿子,说:「你将成为宇宙的支持」。你们可以看见,格涅沙在根轮处,根轮的意思便是根和支持,可是耶稣基督却被放在果实的支持和根部那里,所以是同一力量在那处,并一路进化上来,当我们的宽恕轮打开了,便可以知觉到耶稣基督。

当灵量上升,便会打开宽恕轮。但如果你过份自我取向,两边的汽球很紧迫,便甚么也不能通过。又如果你倾向于超我,性格懦弱,易受宰制,使超我的气球扭曲,宽恕轮也不能打开。我们要使它恢复平衡,从左边移向右边,或从右边移向左边。在得到自觉后,你们便能明白这些霎哈嘉瑜伽的技巧,现在是不能明白的。如果得到平衡,宽恕轮也会变得良好,没有扭曲。这样灵量上升时才能通过。如果你是个正常的人,不倾向于自我或超我,那么提升灵量,通过宽恕轮是毫无问题的。我来到德里以后,从早到晚都要清理宽恕轮,这里的人极端自我取向,他们全都以为自己是世界级的行政人员。德里是个宽恕轮很坏的地方,这里有些很骄傲的人,充满虚荣心,以为自己正在统治世界。那些行政人员和政客便是这类人,全都是自我取向。这类人很难给他们自觉,首先要降低他们的自我,他们要接受神才是至高无上的存有,是我们的主,是这个世界真正的王,这样灵量才会上来。有些人的眼东张西望,以致损害了宽恕轮。耶稣曾经说:「圣典叫你们不要犯奸淫,我说你们不要有淫邪的眼睛。」看,耶稣特别提到眼睛,因为祂就在那个位置,控制着眼睛。可是在西方,很难找到一个男人或女人是没有淫邪的眼睛的。他们都是基督的信徒,却有这样可怕的眼睛,真不知他们做过些甚么,他们正走向疯狂。他们无法固定他们的眼神,要时常的东张西望,左顾右盼。他们的眼睛很贪婪,要经常看这看那,但全然没有喜乐,他们只是周围去看人,却全然没有喜乐。

Translation from Hindi:

Let Me tell you in Hindi. One of My acquaintance had come, his wife was a simple person. When she came to London, she saw people’s eyes looking like this (seeing here and there/ roving eyes). So she asked, “What is happening?” I told, “This is known as flirting”. So she said, “Why do people do it?” I said, “People here do.” What do I tell her why do people do it? I don’t know why people do it. I said, “This person’s wife likes another person. That person’s husband like someone else, it goes on”. She asked, “It goes on even after marriage?” I told her, “It goes on till their death”. She was shocked, “I don’t understand. Our things belongs to us and others things belong to them. What is the fun?” I said, “You ask them”. And not one but everyone is like that. Even when Indians go there, they become like that.

Delhi is very bad in that matter. In Punjabi’s it is a special thing. It’s not there in Maharashtra. In Punjabis, they keep turning their head and looking at every woman till their neck breaks. Till then they will not stop. It is their specialty.

When I got married in Delhi, I saw. While I was studying in Lahore, it was even worse there.

This happened because of parda (veil) system.  Parda system increased people’s curiosity for women. Now there is no parda system, still this is going on. There is no feeling of mother and sister, very less. That’s why Christ has said, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”.

因此耶稣基督说:「你们不要有淫邪的眼睛。」耶稣基督给我们一条诫命,但没有人遵守。就像在回教,穆罕默德叫人不要饮酒,于是Umar Khayaam便写诗反对穆罕默德。现在基督徒也一样,他们反对基督,作出各样反基督的行为,完全破坏人的纯真本性,完全破坏他们的眼睛,完全破坏所有思维的纯洁。

同时他们走向另一个极端,那是耶稣基督从来没有教导过的,却不知如何在基督教中开始,他们要求信徒作教士及修女,过独身的生活。其实这种不沾染的状态是不能勉强的,那是一种「为而不为」(Avastha)的状态,就像瑜伽之主克里希纳那样,是要靠升进来达到的。克里希纳有许多妻子,但祂还是像独身一样。这是种精神状态,你完全不涉入事件之中。但如果你只是将那个独身的意识强加于人,强迫他们过独身的生活,那便完全是两回事。耶稣基督从来没有这样说过。耶稣基督没有结婚,因为祂来到世上是要成就一项伟大的工作,祂要打开宽恕轮,此所以祂要被钉上十字架。这样,祂便在宽恕轮创造出一个空隙,这是祂奉天上父母之命做的。祂把这个使命完成了。但那些人却开始那无意义的独身主义,其实他们是没有守身的,因为他们在思维中没有。守身要从内在开始,纯洁要来自内在。这种强迫的独身为天主教带来许多问题,同时他们开始向教士忏悔,那是另一样荒谬的事情。就我所见,那些教士都不是得到自觉的灵。假如他是个自觉的灵,便一定逃跑,不当教士。但那些人却要向这些教士忏悔,那些可怜的教士会变得疯狂,而忏悔者会使喉轮左部阻塞,因为他有很大的罪疚感。这绝对是错误的,你们完全没有需要感到罪疚。

耶稣降世以后,有许多人是不接受耶稣基督的,像犹太人便是这样,他们不接受耶稣,并说:「我们必须受苦,我们要为神而受苦。」现在就算是基督徒也有认为需要受苦的。甚至印度人也相信必须受苦。但他们知道有摩诃毗湿奴,有一天祂会降世,吸去我们的罪业,这样我们便不用再受苦。其实耶稣基督在你之内被唤醒以后,便会完成这项过程。祂会吸入你罪业,你的自我和超我,祂吸入你的业报和罪孽。可是那些来到印度的传教士,一点都不知道摩诃毗湿奴,他们也不了解耶稣基督。他们一手拿枪,一手拿着圣经,而那些愚蠢的印度人,一点都不知道他们的文化遗产。他们说:「且让我们成为基督徒,这样他们便会给我们一份好职业。」于是那些职业取向的人全都成为基督徒。其实,我们应该告诉他们,摩诃毗湿奴已经降世。如果他们读过Devi Bhagvat,且知道摩诃毗湿奴已经降世,那样人们便会抛弃需要为过去的业行受苦的想法。现在的印度人还认为应该为过去的业行受苦,他们认为需要禁食,游方,或把自己吊在树上。这都是不需要的。你们要做的,是要等待宽恕轮打开的时刻。你们要持守中道,像佛陀教导的那样。当灵量升起以后,那些过去积集的都会被吸去,你便得到解脱。这是很简单的。但许多印度人仍然相信我们必须受苦,必须禁食。

在霎哈嘉瑜伽,我们不许人以神的名禁食。你可以因为别的原因禁食,例如你没有钱,便不得不禁食。但却不可以神的名或为自己的「业」行禁食。就像那些犹太人,他们不接受耶稣基督,认为自己需要受苦,于是他们便苦难无穷,于是希特勒便令他们受尽痛苦,可是在逃离希特勒的魔掌以后,他们自己却变成了希特勒。由此可见那些错误的观念可以把你们带到甚么地步。那些犹太人这样想,于是希特勒便出世来满足他们的愿望。

现在没有任何人需要受苦了,你们要提升灵量,在霎哈嘉瑜伽之中巩固自己,你们的苦难都会统统去除。女神的一个名号是Papa Vimochini,即祂能去除你们的罪孽。格涅沙的一个名号是Sankat Vimochan,一切生命中艰难险阻的去除者。当你得到祝福的时候,便能明白神有许多方法祝福人类,好像是奇迹一样,绝对是奇迹。许多人来到霎哈嘉瑜伽以后,说奇迹这两个字已失去了原来的意义,变成生活中惯见的事实。

因此我们要明白,神是存在的,不单存在,而且会作事,会爱,我们都要去认识神。无论你过去做过些甚么,无论犯过甚么错误,你们最后都要与神合一。因为祂是你们慈爱的父,祂是慈爱的海洋。你们唯一要做的,是要求得到。当灵量升起,你们便能与神合一。你们的父要把祂的国度和权柄交与你们,因为你们都是由祂创造的。因此所有那些荒谬的宗教观念,诸如你们要受苦,要行苦行,要独身等等,都应统统抛弃。你们要成为快快乐乐的人。神为你们做了许多事,祂为你们创造了许多事物。但如果你要楚楚可怜,神能做些甚么呢?

有时候如果你们要令母亲不悦,你们会说:「......否则我便不吃饭。」此所以在霎哈嘉瑜伽不许禁食。但如果你们因某种原因要戒吃某类食品,那是可以的,否则便不要禁食。一年之中除了那一两天特别的日子,你们可以禁食之外,其他日子都不要禁食。

现在我们已经明白,宽恕轮是最重要的门户,每个人都要通过它,因此我们要适当地崇拜及清洁这个轮穴。我们的注意力要非常纯洁,如果你的注意力有所污损,宽恕轮便不能良好。你会看见幻象,你会有错误的观念,会思想那些错误的事情。因此如果你真的希望追求存在的意义,如果你真的希望提升灵量,那便要知道,你过去对神及其他事物的了解都要修正,要自己重新发现,真实是怎样的。除非你通过这个阶段,否则便不能获得真正的洗礼。

施洗约翰教人洗礼,他真是一个得到自觉的灵。他把水放在别人头顶的时候,他真的提升了灵量,让那个人获得自觉。这是真正的洗礼。基督徒的意思是个经过真正洗礼的人,不是任何张三李四把手放在你的头上,凭空乱说,你便得到自觉。因此威廉‧布莱克说:「那教士在我的头上诅咒。」真的,对于一个得到自觉的灵来说,如果那个教士不是得到自觉的灵,却为人施洗,那么受洗的儿童可能会发生问题。我们见过许多生下来便是自觉的儿童因此而产生问题。他们眼睛变成斜视,滑稽可笑,脑筋失灵,我们要去医治他们。因此让别人把手放在你头顶脑囟的位置是很危险的,因为脑囟便是梵穴的所在,是人身中最重要的部位,因此每个人都要非常小心。要按这个部位,你必先是个得到自觉的灵,即霎哈嘉瑜伽修习者,同时知道正确的方法。因此你们的子女出生时你们要小心,如果他们是生下来便是自觉的灵,你们更要加倍小心。如果他们不是自觉的灵,反应不会那么剧烈,但如果是自觉的灵,他们会大声喊叫,因为他们无法忍受。

因此你们要明白,尽管有些事情很传统,但如果对人类有害,我们还是要舍弃它。现在事候来临了。如果你不能接受这一点。作为母亲我只能说:「我是很关心你们的。」但事情其实还不只此,因为你们生长在一个很危险的时刻。

如果宽恕轮后部受破坏,那表示你已被亡灵附身。要是宽恕轮后部有阻塞,那个人会变成瞎眼,尽管他的眼睛能张开,却看不见事物。在印度这是很普遍的。因为印度人有些可笑的观念,说神或女神会进入人的身体。怎么可能呢?这其实是超意识那边的把戏。好像有个女佣,整天粗言秽语,不知清洁为何物,亦不知何谓神圣,但忽然间发出「呵,呵,呵」的声音,她是被亡灵附了体。但在马哈拉施特拉邦的女性却会拜倒在她脚下,说:「女神来临了,女神来临了。」他们拜倒在她的脚下,结果全部都被亡灵附了身。我们最近看见一个很严重的病例,有个男子来见我,说他不能控制自己,老是要拜倒在他弟妇脚下,因为他认为她是女神的化身。我问为甚么?他说:「因为她进入了跳神的状态。」我说如果他认为弟妇是女神,就不要到我这里来。后来他瞎了眼,完完全全的瞎了眼。他瞎了眼以后才到我这里来,我们便把他的宽恕轮治好。

在霎哈嘉瑜伽怎样清洁宽恕轮呢?你们可使用我的相片。在相片前燃点蜡烛。光是能治疗宽恕轮的元素。常常用光或太阳光,因为基督是在太阳中。故此你要做的是将烛光放在面前,放另一支烛光在后面,在你的宽恕轮后部做像崇拜动作[倒马蹄形]的灵体保护(Aarti),这是摩诃格涅沙(Maha Ganapati)及摩诃巴尔伐亚(Maha Bhairava)所在的位置。你只要在这里做Aarti,宽恕轮便会打开。如何打开呢?十分简单,若有甚么杂念来到,你要说:「我宽恕。」这是基督给我们的最大武器。你只要说:「我宽恕,我宽恕。」便能胜过你的自我。这是宽恕轮前部的口诀,在那里你只要说:「我宽恕,我宽恕,我宽恕。」你会发觉你的宽恕轮会打开,你会发觉你的自我会跑掉。「宽恕」是人类得到的其中一个最大的武器。但有些人十分愚蠢,我说要宽恕,他们说:「不宽恕又如何?」他们说宽恕十分困难。我说有甚么困难?你要做甚么呢?你说宽恕的时候,你有甚么要做?你是否要做甚么呢?甚么也没有。相反,若你不去宽恕,有甚么会发生,就那个你不去宽恕的人,实际上是在折磨你,而不是你去折磨那人。故这是宽恕轮前部的口诀。在后部的,我已告诉你,就是要把烛光转动。有些人会尝试做一天,或是做两天,但霎哈嘉瑜伽不是这样生效的。你要认真的完全去做。我看过有些人眼睛倒视,从不能张大眼睛,但现在,已能张大眼睛,眼睛发挥正常的功用。要做是十分简单的。

还有一种事情会在我们的眼睛里发生,若我们的真知轮出现问题,这位置对应头的后部,在宽恕轮后部的周围。故此若患上糖尿病或类似的疾病,那人便会继而失明,因为真知轮的位置是围绕宽恕轮的后部,若出现问题便会挤压宽恕轮后部,令眼睛不能看见,没有了光,就像漆黑中的人张开眼睛,我看见很多糖尿病患者都会失明。因此首先要透过医治真知轮去医治糖尿病。你亦可用冰垫敷在头后部的真知轮。但首先你要改善你的真知轮,你便会好得多。在这情况下,治疗宽恕轮前部的是用光,后部的是用水。最好是视乎你的情况用光或用水。因为若真知轮出现问题便用水,若只是亡魂附身的问题,不是患上糖尿病,这样你便要用光,这是医治宽恕轮的方法。

即使耶稣基督也曾说:我是光,我是道路,因为祂是唵(Omkara),祂是道路。祂是那门,祂是那闸门,每个人都要从这闸门通过。祂从不说谎,但人们就把他钉死。他们就是要钉死祂。很幸运的是在我们的国家中,没有已组织化的宗教。若你们有甚么已组织化的宗教,你们便不会去接受霎哈嘉瑜伽。因为根据那些已组织化的宗教,你只能相信个人,而那个人就好像和其他人甚么关系也没有,他就像个孤独的人挂在空中,他和甚么人也没有关系。因此要感谢神,在我们的国家中没有发生这样事情。因此我们这里的人比其他国家的人,更适合霎哈嘉瑜伽,因为他们没受太多的条件制约,这是一个很大的祝福。例如赛乃夫是原始宗师原理中最后降世的一个神祇,祂是回教徒,但祂的所有门徒都是印度教徒,他们不是回教徒。但回教徒不承认祂的神性。不单这样,有一个地方叫Hazimallang,那里有个回教徒圣人逝世,但他说:「只有婆罗门(Brahmins,意即得到自觉的灵),才能崇拜我。」故此他们聘请一些婆罗门,他们不明白「婆罗门」这个字的意思。那里有印度教徒崇拜回教的先例。故此,若有人成为自觉的灵,他便没有宗教,他是超越宗教,他「成为」宗教。没有甚么可束缚他,因为水滴已进入海洋,他成为海洋,因为对海洋来说是没有限制的,因为他已超越限制,他是在一切事物之上。这是我们所相信的,就是若他是自觉的灵,他就是得到自觉的灵。有一次我到一个小村落,叫做Mian Ki Takdi,当我步入这村落,我感应到巨大的生命能量,我问:「有甚么伟大的圣人在这里居住?」他们说以往有一个回教修行者(peer),我说:「无论怎样,他一定是圣人」。当我坐着讲授的时候,有光照射我的头上七次。第七次我如此举起我的手。但没有人看见那光,只有我知道。我知道那光,我和那光欢笑。而那些人拍摄的,便能拍照出来,在相片中看到。

所以所有得到自觉的灵都在周围帮助,他们不会进入任何人的身体,不会麻烦你,他们只是指导你走正确的方向。带他们的天使来帮助你到正确的道路,到正确的终点。他们从不会附在你的身上,从不会催眠你,或把你带到错误的生活方向。因此,若你同样是得到自觉的灵,你要知道你要完全地知道甚么是真实。继续去明白,尝试去吸收,不要因为你要依附任何组织而抛弃它。在霎哈瑜伽里没有甚么组织,你们也十分清楚知道。在霎哈嘉瑜伽里,没有组织,没有会员证,但这是一个活生生的组织,是一个有生命的组织,因此任何事情在这里发生,整个身体都会知悉,我们不用列明甚么组织,霎哈嘉瑜伽的工作就是如此成就。

但我仍然要说的是,就如在我们的身体内有不同的感官系统,同样,我们在霎哈嘉瑜伽里都是一样。有些人来练习,他们只是初学者,便不用说给他们知道,那些他们所不能承受的真理。若他们已明白了很多,已进入无思虑的入静状态(Nirvichar Samadhi)的人,他们便可以进入新的向度,但核心的人是那些在无疑惑的入静状态的人(Nirvikalpa),这些人才可以真的教授霎哈嘉瑜伽。若那人还是在次阶段的,便会被筛走,因为这里有吸入及排出的力量在工作,一种力量是把你吸引回来,另一种力量是把你赶出去。没有人担心要拥有一个庞大的成员组织。若是庞大而有好的,自然是希望拯救愈多人愈好。但没有人会去游说你,没有人会像马戏团般去招揽你。到来与否是那人纯洁的愿望。这是个人的愿望,那些来了的人,你不用做甚么,你不能勉强人得到自觉。

这是我今天要向你们说有关宽恕轮的,我已在英国和美国讲过很多次宽恕轮,有时亦会被一些教会及其他人士所针对,但我想若他们想继续生存,他们「最好」要接受真理,「知道」他们所知的并不完全,他们要知道全面的真理。因为耶稣基督不能说太多,有关耶稣基督的话,门徒只能以他们所明白的方式记下。要明白耶稣基督,你们便要先得到自觉。

愿神祝福你们。

If you have any questions, you can ask Me again today for a while and then I’ll make a move because today I was unusually late. But it happens. You have to get out of time. You have to get into timelessness. You have to get deconditioned about timing. Those who see time too much, they must learn to get out of time. And that is very, very important because time is according to certain auspiciousness has to be worked out. It is not to be worked out the way we think ‛this is the time“ and I cannot be the slave of this watch. I have another watch of My own. So it all works out that way. I am not guilty for coming late, but I’m sorry because you had to wait.
Hindi Speech:
Q: What is the reason for having dreams?
Shri Mataji: The reason for dreams is that when you are sleeping your attention moves either to the supraconscious side or to the subconscious side, your attention starts moving. And then you start seeing things which are connected with your subconscious or your collective subconscious and all this thing. And you may go onto the supraconscious side where you see your future and all this thing. But the reason why you get dreams actually is that the unconscious, which is within you, or you can say the Kundalini or your Atma is trying to guide you to the right path. And how does it guide you to the right path? Is through dreams. But these are misunderstood.
How do you understand these dreams because you are so confused. First, you go deep into yourself and you touch the unconscious — sushupti stithi. But from there you come out. And then when you are coming out, you touch your subconscious or maybe supraconscious. So whatever anubhuti you had, or whatever experience you had, of the depths of the sushupti gets confused and you don’t know what you dreamt, and you don’t understand and you forget it. But those who are realized souls go to their sushupti and see exactly what they have to know. Like many people in Bombay when I came, they didn’t know I was coming but they were at the airport because they got the dream. So at this sushupti level, at the deep level, you get the communication with God if you know how to go in and come out fully aware. But if you get confused with supraconscious or subconscious areas or if you start, your chitta is not so clear-cut, then there can be a big confusion.
Question — How can you compartmentalize? What happens when a person is a realized soul? What is the state? When he is a realized soul, what happens to a man?
Shri Mataji: See, the first thing is to say that ‛how can we compartmentalize it?“ because is the ego and superego is on two sides. Actually, have you not noticed in our body, everything is a compartment. You see even a cell is a compartment. Everything has a boundary. It’s not some sort of a ... even the blood has to pass through the channels. It has to go through these arteries. Everything is a compartment. There’s nothing like something just left there like a pulp. If it becomes the pulp, you won’t exist. So, everything is in compartment. Its ego and superego are like balloons and they are two balloons which can press each other, which can flow on one side. Now see the ego, though it is placed on the left hand side more, is placed like this on the left-hand side more, and this one on the right-hand side is the superego. Still, the ego when it increases in size it starts moving on the right-hand side and the superego, when it starts moving, it starts moving this way. So everything is in a compartment in our body. You are sadly mistaken if you think there’s anything is in a pulp, nothing. Or something like a air flowing in. Nothing like that. Everything has a channel. Everything is in a compartment.
Question — What happens to a man if he is a realized soul?
Shri Mataji: Now that is — I have been telling you what happens to a man he is a realized soul that his ego and superego are sucked in and he gets a dent in the fontanel bone area, and the Kundalini shoots off, and he can feel the Cool Breeze coming out of his head, and he can feel it in his hand. This is only on the central nervous system this happens. But so many things happen much more – how to use this power, what it means and all that you have to learn.
Question – In spite of tremendous stress on Kundalini by Your Holiness, it is hard for me to reconcile myself with the fact that there is not the slightest reference of Kundalini in the authoritative guides on yoga – I mean Patanjali's Yoga Sutras or Gita. Why?
Shri Mataji: Yes it is surprising that people will say ... He says that in Yoga Sutras of Patanjali it is not written about Kundalini and also about Gita it’s not written about Kundalini. Is a fact because, you see, it was a secret science. It was kept a secret science, in My first lecture only I said, till the Sixth Century. In the Sixth Century, Adi Shankaracharya for the first time opened his mouth about it. It was a secret science with very great gurus like Janaka gave Realization to Nachiketa. And in the same way Shri Krishna did not talk about it, because you see even when Markandeya talked about it, people did not know what he was talking. They never thought him to be a sensible man.
Then later on as the people became into two compartments, one on the right, one on the left side, some started worshipping God in a devotion and in a bhakti way, then another started doing yAgnya havanadi things. So whatever was required for these two types of things evolved and that’s what developed. The central side of evolution was kept a secret. And even at the time of Shri Krishna, it was not mentioned, not a word about this thing was mentioned because this is an internal happening, it’s antar yoga. It was not described, but Shri Krisha hinted at it, that you have to have your yoga. But how, He did not say because that was not the time. He was the one who laid the seeds. That’s why He is called as Krishna. Krishna means ‛krishi,“ the one who has done krishi. So this one was laid, the sprouting had to come. Today it was to be told.
So I am telling you about it. Everything is not told at the same time. Same in Sahaja Yoga. We don’t tell you everything at this state. About Agnya Chakra I have told you something, but not all. Gradually when you will be so aware, I will tell you. It has to be seen how far to be said at what time. And that’s what was needed at that time was told by Krishna. So Gita is the one which only tells you that this will happen. But Gyaneshwara, who was born after the sixth century, in Gyaneshwari has written about Kundalini clearly. Because, though Gita it is not written, but he said, ‛this is how it is done.“ Gynaeshawara has written. Though he has written, it’s not, it’s the Gita translated into a common language, he put also the knowledge of Kundalini. Because at that time, it was to be told. Before that, it was not to be told. Shankaracharya in the sixth century did it, then Gyaneshwara did it, then Nanaka did it, then Kabira did it. All these people did it. Not only, but even Mohammed Sahib in a way has talked about it – about the Sahaja Yoga and resurrection time. They all started talking about the resurrection time much later as they started seeing people getting it. Because to talk too much about the future is dangerous. That time Shri Krishna was placed with Arjuna when they were at the war, and that time He had to talk about the problems of hinsa, ahinsa and those ideas which we have about — wrong ideas we have. And that’s how He talked on that subject. Whatever was the subject, He talked on that and He told him how to become one with God ... not how...that when you become one with God, you become a stithaprAgnya. He gave the idea as to what will happen to you. But how it will happen He did not say. That was left to Me to explain. They can’t do everything, I have to do something, isn’t it? Because if He had said how, then they would have said, ‛Give me Realization.“ But they were not prepared for realization.
Question: I have tried to go into spiritualism in the real sense of the word. But my health is deteriorating day by day.
Shri Mataji: Some gentleman has done spiritualism in the real sense of the word, and his health is deteriorating. I have told you already what is the reason for that is – you take to spiritualism out of ignorance. There’s no spiritualism. There is no ‛ism“ with God. Spirit cannot be ‛ismized“. So, you take to Sahaja Yoga. Become your Spirit. You cannot ‛ism“ it. That’s one thing you cannot ‛ism.“ You can have ‛isms“ in everything. But Spirit is detached. It cannot be put into ‛isms.“ So those who say ‛spiritualism“ must know they have done wrong. All right? You come to Sahaja Yoga and forget it. I know I am sorry for that. You are misled but God is there and Spirit is there. In Sahaja Yoga we promise you that. Whatever mistakes you have done, it can be corrected. Hindi Speech.
I would say that whatever I said today, you must take the tape and listen to it at home. I’ve said all these things already. But your attention should have been there. Now you take a tape from these people. Listen to it. I’ve said the same thing which you are telling – that these are the problems of a big person who goes to these things and how he gets into problems. All right? So when you come to Sahaja Yoga. I know you are a seeker. And, if you are a seeker, that will be given to you. That’s your right to have it.
May God bless you.
Question: Which will be the end of all the world and of humankind?
Shri Mataji: Which will be the end of world? Again, futuristic, very futuristic. Let’s not talk about the end. Just now is the beginning. When the child is born we just don’t think about his death, do we? So better be worried about the beginning of this new world that we have started and don’t think of the death and all those things. Forget it for the time being.
Question: [written question in Hindi from a Sahaja Yogi from Kanpur]
Shri Mataji: There’s a gentleman from Kanpur he says that in Kanpur people are only interested in the physical curing. Have nothing to do with these wretched people, in this place. You just have nothing to do with them. If they are interested in material well being, Sahaja Yoga is not for such people. At all. If they don’t want to have God. Forget them. Let Kanpur be drowned in Ganges if they are like that. Useless people. Absolutely. Why should you worry about them? If they don’t want to have God. Don’t waste your energy on people who just want to be cured. It’s absolutely useless such people, they are very selfish, self-centred and troublesome. They are good for nothing. If they don’t want to have God, we have nothing to do with them. We have no relationship with them. They can go to the hospitals, take expensive medicines and die there.
I don’t like people who just come to Sahaja Yoga for only physical fitness. Is this is a hospital, or what? Reducing it to that level is not good. Anybody who thinks that he should help others should start helping them in Kundalini and not start curing people. Please don’t do that. I’ve told a hundred times, don’t do curing. Because what will happen if you start curing you’ll start thinking that ‛I’m curing“ and you’ll get into supraconscious. So better not do it. You just put yourself into a state which is proper for Sahaja Yoga. Gradually people will know you and will start coming to you.
But as far as is U.P. is concerned, God save that country, that place. I am married in that place. I know the people. Useless, absolutely good for nothing. They made Sitaji go to Banbas, who can forgive them? All dobhis, that’s all. U.P. wallas have a very great ego, you know. We had a servant who was from U.P. I am also married in U.P. I shouldn’t say but I saw that very clearly. And we had another one who was from Madras. So he was very clean Madrasi fellow, cleaning everything nicely, working very hard.
So I told this U.P. walla, I said that ‛If you don’t learn all these qualities, one day you will have no jobs in Delhi and you’ll all go out of jobs. You’d better learn all these qualities of Madrasi people – how neat they are, clean they are. They take their baths every day. You’re a lazy lump.“
So he said, ‛Ah, thika, inko to bartan majne dijiye hum to raj karange. [Hindi. Translation: all right, let them clean utensils, we will rule]
They are all going to do raj, just imagine. So one must understand that every place has its own problems. Out of them U.P. and Bihar, I don’t know how it is going to work out. I am worried. I have already tried to send somebody to Lucknow to do something. My house is in Lucknow. My relations are in Lucknow. I’ve given Realization to all My relations but they find it strange, the whole thing is so strange, you know. You don’t know what to do with that place. Imagine a nawab married three hundred and sixty-five wives. Can you imagine such a nawab living in that horrid place? Singing gazals morning till evening. All the dirty things they do. And I don’t know if you can really bring them around.
There are some nice people. I wouldn’t say there aren’t. But on the whole, the whole system is based on something very nonsensical and to bring them around.... Specially Kanpur is such a materialistic place, very materialistic. Very materialistic people. The Ganges flows — Ganga, Gomati, Yamuna — all these rivers are in the north, cleansing morning till evening, working so very hard. When will the people realize?
So the Kanpur gentleman should come and settle down in Maharashtra. Rama also had to leave with Sita. [In Hindi – Shri Mataji says sorry to people in audience who are from UP – the place of Shri Mataji’s in-laws.]
Question: When I give realization to persons who have meagre desire or to my own family members as there is no Sahaja Yogi?
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, no. Don’t try your family members. That’s not proper. Those who have no desire for Sahaja Yoga, you cannot push them in. It’s impossible. Who is your family? These are your family.
Like Christ once they asked, ‛Your brothers and sisters are calling You.“
He said, ‛Who are My brothers?“
‛Your brothers are calling You.“
He said, ‛Who are My brothers?“ He looked around.
Don’t push your family members. All right? They’ll become bhoots. Because if you push them, imagine, Agnya Chakra is closed, they’ll go to the left or to the right. They’ll become bhoots or not. Don’t push them at all.
What else?
Question: One of my cousin brothers here in Delhi where I’m staying drinks wine but does not want to come to the Sahaj Yog program in spite of my persuasion as he’s convinced that he simply can’t drink or smoke after attending the program.
Shri Mataji: You see, somebody’s brother doesn’t want to come to Sahaja Yoga program because he thinks after coming to program he cannot drink and smoke. Now, I would say that you need not tell him this secret that after Sahaja Yoga you don’t drink and smoke. You need not tell him. Once you bring him and he gets Realization, he will not do it. So let us manage it on that level. Better not tell him if you are interested. I don’t say. Did I say, ‛Don’t drink, don’t smoke“? Did I say so? I don’t say so. But it just happens. So just let it be, let them come as they are.

Translation from Hindi:
Shri Mataji: What are they saying? Tell Me if it is sensible, otherwise there is no point in wasting time on useless talks.

Sahaja Yogi (reading out): Revered Mother, I bow to You respectfully at Your lotus feet. The meditation we do in Mooladhara chakra, of Shri Ganesha, how should it be done? How is the scene at Mooladhara meditation? Meaning do we see the nadis nearby or is there some other scene?

Shri Mataji: You have asked that how should we do meditation of Ganeshji? And whether we can see something there on the Nadi or not.

I told you today itself that if you see something then you are outside. Because when you see you halt.  Your movememt stops. There is nothing to see. You don’t see any scene. You are there. Seeing anything is wrong. If anyone sees anything, then they are not there. And you should not see also.

While going to the airport from here, you see thousands of scenes. If we go on looking at all this, how will we reach the airport? We have to reach the airport. That’s why stop seeing. just imbibe and absorb. That is important.  Experience.

You asked how we should do meditation of Shri Ganesha. For this you please come to our centre. There you will be taught the method of meditation. Learn that properly and listen to what they tell you. You may not even need to do meditation on Shri Ganesha. They will tell you on what to meditate. You yourself will come to know on which (chakra) you have to meditate.

Based on your state, based on your requirement, you will come to know yourself and you will be able to judge for yourself.

Sahaja Yogi (reading a question): Body is purified by water, mind by truth. And soul by – he has left it blank. Is it austerity and reason?

Shri Mataji: He has asked – body is purified by water and mind by what?

Sahaja Yogi: Mind by truth

Shri Mataji: Mind by truth and ..

Sahaja Yogi: Soul is by – he has left it blank. Is it by austerity and reason?

Shri Mataji: He thinks soul is purified by austerity. Not at all. it doesn’t happen. It is the other way round. In Sahaja Yoga, first the top floor is built then the lower ones. First you are given realization. In the light of that you see what is wrong with you.  Where the dirt is in your body.  In that light you understand where your mind is unclean. In that light you see the problems of your soul. First the lamp is lit.

Shri Krishna has also said  that this tree (of awareness) is hanging upside down. The tree of life is hanging upside down. Its branches grow downwards, and its roots are on top.  So first of all, we take you up and give realization in the roots itself. First understand the roots. Once the roots become alright, the rest of the tree will become alright by itself.

This is the significance of Sahaja Yoga. First the root is awakened.

Even otherwise, if you have to treat any tree and you say – „ first make the leaves alright, then make the trunk in the center alright”. Nothing can be done.

But if you go down to the roots directly, then through  the roots you can save the entire tree. This is the path of Sahaja Yoga that you go down to your roots. The root is on top at the Sahasrara. Then you are nourished by the Chaitanya, with which all your mind, knowledge, ego and body, whatever other physical problem you have, is cleared out.

1:18:22  -  If there are any people from UP (North India) please forgive Me.  That is the place of My in laws.

1:20:23  - This person says „there is a problem with my stomach.  My liver region is swollen.  There are soe light patches on my back”.

Shri Mataji:  This person says he has a problem with his stomach, his spleen is bad, etc..  If he has smoked, or drunk alcohol, then may God save him, because our hands are tied.  So the first letter that came, is its answer in the second letter.

That is why, only when they get pain in the stomach, they will come to Sahaja Yoga.  When their spleen gets enlarged, then they will come to Sahaja Yoga.  Those whose spleen is enlarged should come to the Center, in the same way that you go to a doctor, with full faith they should come.  Anywhere else people charge, take away your money, and sometimes even your life. No one knows.

But those who come to Sahaja Yoga with full faith and trust, they get all the treatment and advice free of charge.  And if they do the treatments with full faith and devotion, they get immediate benefits.  But because it is free, people do not respect or value it.  You come and tell us all your problems, and after that, not only uyour complaints will be solved, but you will also get union with Paramatma (God almighty).  Has this ever happened anywhere?

There is a proverb – I went to ask God for light, and instead He gave me Paigambari (prophet or apostlehood)

That is the situation in Sahaja Yoga.  You will come to ask for fire or flame, and you will get sainthood.  He spoke about it – William Blake.  That men of God will become prophets. And they will have the power to make others prophets.

We are giving you „Paigam”.  You will come to cure your spleen, and you will take back with you prophet-hood.  This is what is Sahaja Yoga.  It is such a great thing.  Even to understand it you have to have that intrinsic quality.

Shri Mataji – Finished?  Now please excuse Me.  Those who wish to touch My Feet, may come.  But with decorum.  Dont rush.  Dont run.  I am sitting here.
