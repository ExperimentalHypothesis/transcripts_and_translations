1991-0405 Short Puja and Talk, Cairns, Queensland, Australia

(Notes: whatever you find in Italic and bold, refers to speech in Marathi language)

Sahaja yogi: Gravity is also one type of energy, isn't it, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Of course, in the Feet.

Babamama: In the Feet. Because it is one of the things which balances us, called migraine (n.t. probably Baba Mama meant magnetism). Migraine (n.t. magnetism), migraine is one thing which balances us. Is there any relation between head and the feet?

Shri Mataji: The whole feet are in the head. (n.t. connected to the head).

Babamama: The feet are in the head?

Shri Mataji: Or head is in the feet. 

Babamama: I also thought the same. Head in the feet or feet in the head, because...

Shri Mataji: When you rub My soles, vibrations come of your head.

Babamama: Yes.

Shri Mataji: [unclear]

Babamama: Yes, because when we rub Your Feet, we get a very good sleep.

Shri Mataji: Now, if we start from here...

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: If you start... Now see, if you fold the sari like this, you see, the break is a fourth, you see. So when it opens out, you see, these chakras open up like this, see. So, this one at the back are the chakras and these are the incarnations. So in the center comes the heart.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Here is Mooladhara and here's Agnya. Then is Swadhishtana. Now, this Swadhishthana is moving like that. Right? And then comes the Nabhi.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: So these are the incarnations here. Now the Nabhi incarnation is Virata, is here.

Babamama: They all go up till the pitha - I know.

Shri Mataji: I mean, like this they open out. So Mooladhara becomes Christ. Then, you get this Swadhishthana. Swadhishtana we have got the incarnations like Ali.

Babamama: Yes.

Shri Mataji: He is one of them. Or you can say all these “Nath Panthis” and all. Then comes the... third chakra is Nabhi. Nabhi is Lakshmi Narayana. So they are expressed here, as Virat. Now ultimately you come to Heart. Heart is here.

Babamama: OK. Jai Shri Mataji. Now, I see!

Shri Mataji: So there is only one for heart, because at that point they meet.

Babamama: Yes.

Shri Mataji: When you get diabetes, what happens is, of course Swadhishtana is here also. This is the “Nath Panthi”, right? But here at the back what happens, when you get diabetes, your Swadhishtana [is there]. And the Swadhishtana is surrounding the Mooladhara in the brain - on top, so it presses. And that’s how you get problems with the eyes in diabetes. So if you put ice - if your liver is bad also, you get problems of eyes. So you put ice on that, on the back side, your eyes can be cured. For diabetes, simply put ice on the liver and ice here (on the back Agnya). But also there is a little touch of left in diseases like that, because, after all, diabetes is caused by the left organs. So you have to use lemons also. You know, [after use], throw them away. For diseases like that. For liver you don’t have. Liver is on the right side. For right-side organs you don’t have to use. But even I have seen, if you get asthma, that is also the right side, but little bit triggered by the left.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: So no use using lemon all the time, I mean, whatever disease may be, right or left. But in some places is just left - mental cases. Then you have to only work on lemons, left side, light. When it is right side, then you have to use only water. When it is left side you have to use the light.

Babamama: When it's left side, we have to use the light, and the right side, you have to use the water. So it's only the left hand, left-sided people get right-side disease and the right-sided people get left disease? Is that the manifestation, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: No.

Babamama: Not necessarily!

Shri Mataji: You see, right-sided people get first of all the liver.

Babamama: Yes.

Shri Mataji: As a result, the liver has to excrete its heat into the bloodstream. But it does not. So what happens that that heat passes upwards or downwards. So, when it goes upwards, it causes asthma to the lungs. When it goes downwards also the coagulation of the kidneys take place. So problems of kidneys start - you cannot pass urine. If it is goes further also you get constipation. But if it passes on the sides, then you get a massive heart attack. Supposing a person is drinking very early in age and also playing very hard games, he will die at a very young age. Now, the left-sided problems are more mental. They are depressant. They are sulky.

Babamama: They are emotional.

Shri Mataji: They are unhappy. They are crying. No, even the people who are right-sided can cry, because they think they are very miserable, but they are not. They make everybody miserable. Right-sided people make others miserable and the left-sided people suffer themselves.

Babamama: All Christians must be left-sided, Shri Mataji. All Christians should be left-sided then.

Shri Mataji: They try to, but they are not. Where have you seen them to be kind? In any country they went with the gun in their hands and Bible in the other hand.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: These Christians have killed thousands! They are not Christians at all. Not at all. So this is how. Then the psychosomatic comes when both combine. Like cancer, can be a person, can get it when... 

Babamama: Left and right.

Shri Mataji: ...he uses right side too much, but triggered by the left. So, first always try left for such people, incurable, any incurable diseases. Try first left, then the right.

Babamama: I see. It means he must start with the light. 

Shri Mataji: I mean, not in everyone if they are right-sided, but you see, you can see on the...

Babamama: On the vibrations. 

Shri Mataji: Now supposing you have hot vibrations on the left, then start on that. Hot vibrations on right, then start on that. Immediately you will know which one to start first.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji. 

Shri Mataji: And you should all get into it. You see, we have got now [Gayakwar].

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: So good.

Babamama: He is, really... He describes the house of a person whom he has never visited because on vibrations, he can feel that. He's gone, he's gone so deep. He can describe the house of a person, whom he has not visited.

Shri Mataji: Yes. He goes to the right, Baba, that's the problem with him. He shouldn’t do all these things. There's no need. Why to describe somebody's house? I mean, it's senseless. 

Babamama: Yes.

Shri Mataji: In Sahaja Yoga you should do whatever is necessary. Whatever is not necessary why to do it? Describe somebody’s house! What is the need? 

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: He goes right-sided. I've told him to stop all these things. Only just feel the vibrations. That’s all. Otherwise he'll lose powers. You better tell him once he shouldn't do all these things. I've told him already.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: We had one fellow like that and he went so much to the right and unfortunately he met one Scientologist lady. And then he just vomited blood, vomited blood and died.

Babamama: It is again an imbalance, Shri Mataji - misutilising the power.

Shri Mataji: No, no, you go to the right - sees futures! So why? You just see this. What is the need to see this - somebody’s house? One should try to understand what is the need to do unnecessary things. How many unnecessary things we do? I mean, we are like monkeys, I tell you, in a way.

Babamama: That You were saying Shri Mataji, once, that our, our ancestors have left a permanent imprint on us. I remember You have said.

Shri Mataji: I mean unnecessarily as monkeys will go on doing things and all. We too [unclear]. We are copycats like them. Absolutely we are copycats. Once a monkey came into our room. We are staying in somebody’s house, upstairs. And it took a pair of C.P.’s one shoe. And C.P. got quite worried, "Now what to do?" It has taken [unclear] - one shoe. This is very easy. I took another shoe and put it on the ground. He also put it on the ground. Brainless creatures. And that’s how we follow fashions, because we are brainless. Monkey brands. But Hanumana had wisdom. Hanumana was a monkey which shot up because of His wisdom. We are still monkeys and fools! [Folly] pets I think! Why to do unnecessary things? Just, it’s not necessary.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji

Shri Mataji: That’s all, very simple.

Babamama: And wisdom will tell you as to what is necessary and what is not necessary.

Shri Mataji: Of course, vibrations are there.

Babamama: Vibrations will tell you, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: That at least, minimum you have is wisdom.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: If you people don't even get your wisdom, what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga? If you are still a donkey it’s better not to come to Sahaja Yoga, this is the point, you see. At least ask for wisdom. [But that's not so] - what they do, as soon as they come they want assert themselves, "I am something," you know. I say, "Big pot."

Babamama: I say, "Big pot he is." Shri Mataji, would it be proper to conclude that, for that, the culmination of pure knowledge is wisdom, in Sahaja Yoga?

Shri Mataji: What is the...?

Babamama: The culmination of pure knowledge is wisdom, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: No, wisdom is the symptom of it.

Babamama: It’s a symptom of that. Oh, I see! It’s a reverse.

Shri Mataji: Effect. But also you have the wisdom to see what is necessary, what is not necessary.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: You just do what is necessary.

Babamama: Because, even if it feels, as they say knowledge has come, they say the wisdom is lingering, because if you are not wise and you’re knowledgeable, that is useless.

Shri Mataji: So that’s what I say, yoga without knowledge is useless, and knowledge without yoga is useless.

Babamama: I see.

Shri Mataji: Wisdom is something which is within ourselves, you see, only it’s like an ocean. Only thing you have to get into it. It’s a symptom of that knowledge, or you can say is the projection or the light. But you are not worldly-wise. You don't, you are not meticulous, but you are in that ocean. So the ocean looks after. The ocean has the wisdom, no doubt of it. And you accept it, you see, that "All right, this was to be. All right, doesn’t matter." Let it go on! Don’t get frustrated with it. Just say, "All right, this was the part of the game." Like we have lots of [funny], horrible things in this Australia. One after another they are cleared out. Some were really unwise people, extremely unwise. So they went away.

Babamama: I think you would require wisdom even to understand what vibrations are saying, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: No, you have to have just vibrations, Baba. That's so innately built within you. We don’t need any wisdom to see things through our eyes. It’s your awareness now.

Babamama: But we don’t we have to go to mental level to...

Shri Mataji: No, no, not at all.

Babamama: Not at all.

Shri Mataji: No need. You know already what it is now. Immediately you will know what’s wrong with this person, what’s wrong with that person, what’s wrong with you. But the problem in the West is this thing, you see. Two – double type - in India, and different here. Here they say, “Yes, I have ego. All right, so what?" As simple. In India, they'll say, “No, I don’t have ego”! I mean, both ways it’s just the same. Here they just come out, "Yes, I have terrible ego, Mother. I know, I have terrible ego." Then you start looking, "[Wrong but] true!" They just confess.

Babamama: It's ego's idea, of course.

Shri Mataji: Yes, I know... Yes, of course, ego is quite intact. But, you see, they say it. In India they would never say such a thing, you know? They would never say such a thing - never. They never accept. They never feel guilty. Can you imagine these Indians? We have quite shameless people there (n.t. in India). I got a letter about Patrice - many - and I asked him, from Finland. I said, “Patrice, there is so much complaints about you.” “Yes, Mother, I have a terrible ego. I know that – terrible.” I didn’t know what to say to him after that. Here, people will shamelessly tell you. In India people are shameless and they will never accept, and here people will tell you shamelessly.

Babamama: Because it’s considered to be a social taboo, Shri Mataji, to be egoistic in India, I think. I mean, a bad we'll be said the “garvishtha”. Is that something we say? Garvishtha, garvishtha.

Shri Mataji: I know that in our place, you see, is such a, so many stuff, good manners and social taboos. I mean, we'll never say to somebody, “I hate you”, can we? Does anyone say in Marathi, "I hate you"? 

Babamama: If someone says "I hate you", then that's it. 

Shri Mataji: I mean, imagine. I would regard him as a mad man or something - is absolutely stupid.

Babamama: So it will be so uncultured, the statement. This will be considered, it will be considered a very uncultured statement.

Shri Mataji: Uncool. But they are never going to say that ever.

Babamama: Yes, we will not say also, because, because of the taboo...

Shri Mataji: The social taboo.

Babamama: The social taboo.

Shri Mataji: Bhayankar (n.t. excessive) good manners are ingrained in Indians. But here invariably they say, "I hate you", "I hate you, I hate this, I hate that," all the time.

Babamama: Yeah, there is, there are only two stages. Either you hate somebody or you like somebody.

Shri Mataji:  How can they use the word "hate" so easily? In our place, imagine, if somebody says like that, the father will beat him.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Here, they will say "darling" to anyone. They will say, "I love you" to anyone. In India they will do it secretly. Openly they will never do it.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji. And again it has a bearing...

Shri Mataji: Yes, on the social taboos. Whether they'll hate you like a snake, they'll never openly say so. That’s India. That’s another extreme. This is another extreme. But if you have ego why not correct it? Thank God you know you have ego. So why not correct it?

Sahaja yogi: Here, Mother, if, it's almost to the point, if you hate somebody you put in advertisement in the newspaper so everybody knows it.

Shri Mataji: Is it so?

Sahaja yogi: It's not quite, but...

Babamama: Yes.

Shri Mataji: I mean, nobody will say.

Babamama: Then amounting to.

Shri Mataji: But if you hate someone, supposing, I'm taking another view, central view - now, supposing you hate someone... So what? Who are you? What’s your authority?

Babamama: That's right. 

Shri Mataji: You hate. So hate. Go ahead.

Babamama: And that again is a product of ego, Shri Mataji! Hating...

Shri Mataji: I hate you.

Babamama: I hate! I hate! So it’s a product of ego.

Shri Mataji: Who are you? I mean, you hate. OK, what does it matter? I mean, who are you? Authority - what is your authority saying, "I hate you"?

Babamama: So the reply, should be, "Go and jump in the sea."

Shri Mataji: Or, should be that, "As you do, I do." But that won’t be wise, just to say that, "All right, I had enough."

Babamama: But in Marathi, how do we say, Shri Mataji? "Same to you."

Shri Mataji: Same to you! Marathi language is only humor, humor, humor.

Sahaja yogi: It's the same with this forgiveness thing, isn't it, Shri Mataji? I mean, who are we not to forgive? What are we doing when we don't forgive? It's the same what are we doing when we hate. I mean, it's all here.

Shri Mataji: I mean, there's nothing that you do: hate only. But... you see, at least when you say, ′′I don't forgive,” you have a right about yourself, that you forgive or don't forgive. But if you hate, what right have you got to hate anyone? And even if you hate, who, who cares for you are hating? You are not God, that you hate me, and it means it has a meaning or has any purpose or has an effect. 

Babamama: And the Christians, pardon me, Shri Mataji, are forbidden, both for, for forgiving or for hating, because both these places they acquire the status of judgment. In both the cases, they are judging. And there is prohibition for judgment in...

Shri Mataji: But forgiving, yes...

Babamama: Even forgiving you are judging, Shri Mataji. You are judging that, "I, I have judged you and I have forgiven you."

Shri Mataji: It's all just in the head! Keeping in the head, all right. 

Babamama: So they are so anti-Christian qualities.

Shri Mataji: Oh, this you pour here. That way. It’s all anti-Christian, Baba. It's all anti-Hindu, anti-Christian, anti-Muslim.

Babamama: It's anti-God, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: It's all anti-God. We should relate to One - the Absolute. Otherwise is all absurd. What is the criteria for this kind of different, different types of things that people have? Means division undivided. There should be no difference.

Babamama: Because God has made no difference between human being and human being, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: He has just varieties, that's all. Variety is important. Otherwise we will be bored stiff, you see. To see all of us that's the same, imagine. How it would look.

Babamama: Shri Mataji, even the animals would be having this variety. I mean, supposing there is tiger and there is another tiger.

Shri Mataji: Yes, but they are under the control of God. They are "pashu", aren't they? In the "Paash" (leash) control of God, they don’t have problem of sin at all. A tiger can go and kill any cow, eat it nicely, leave it for others to eat. He doesn’t think he has committed any sin. It's only the human being in their freedom think they are committing sins. 

So for human beings, the second stage, first the stage of the animals is to be completely under the control of Divine. And then the second stage is, human beings where they have freedom to choose. And then, in their own freedom, they should control their divinity, which they have got it. Control means they should be under the divinity that they have got, the light that they have got. But here they are aware. Animals are not aware. In our awareness we have to know that we are free and surrendered. This is the difference is. So in three stages we [move], from animal, human and then to superhuman. 

Any confession in the West, Baba, is so horrifying. You can’t read them, really. I used to get piles and piles of letters and would burn them. Confessions are the worst thing. It's coming from Catholic church, I think. "Confessing my past life." Who is interested in your past life? Piles and piles of letters. "Mother, I did this, I did...” I mean, I just don’t want to know about it - finished. I am here for cleansing. Right, right hand, put your left like this. Put right straight. After some time it shakes. And they say, "I have bhoots." They will also say that, “Mother, I have got a bhoot in me. There's no harm. I am negative, that’s all.” Then what do you do? I mean it's a confession of a thief, you know. It’s very difficult for Me to deal with them, then. So they have confessed. So what? It’s a Christian idea, that as long as you confess it to a priest, you are out of it.

Babamama: Yes, your sins is lost. Because their idea is that Christ had come to wash your sins, and if you come clean, then He will be doing, doing the... He will be laundering your sins, you see.

Shri Mataji: Same with Me, but there is no need to confess.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Not necessary. I know already whatever is there. But by confession, you say, "I have now confessed it." So what?

Babamama: "So I am free. I have got a clean slate for another set of sins."

Sahaja yogi: "Yes, I have to make room for the next lots."

Shri Mataji: You have to go to the end of Feet. All right. May God bless you. Now, don’t feel guilty. Little bit probably, but don't feel guilty. Let's go. It's done. I will get ready. We have to go now. Still little time. But otherwise, you see, it’s working out very well, I must say.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji. 

Shri Mataji: I never expected, Baba, in My lifetime to see all this, really, to be very frank. So I'm very happy. And the more you open out the vision, the more you will see and more see the peripheries also. It's very encouraging, that so many can see so clearly and know, and I can talk to them. Imagine Christ talking to these people there, to the multitudes. I used to say mule-titudes. Mules - talk to the mules. And they crucified Him, very nicely. I mean, just think of that. Later, when they accept this article, we will write about them, about Andha Shraddha (blind faith).

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: I will definitely write an article before leaving. I think there is already an article written about.

Babamama: They started their activity, Shri Mataji, because of the gullible rural people. And they, they also did not want to bring into their fold the real gurus. But now they have become so successful and the success is given, I mean triggered out their ego. So now they are taking everywhere.

Shri Mataji: No, no, not everywhere. Not everywhere. Recently, there was an article in this "Police Times" (Marathi newspaper). And that Andha Shraddha Nirmulan has been blasted. And she wrote that. There was a lady who was taking out these, kumkums and this and that. And they said, "We'll give you 2 lakhs if you show us." And she showed them. They never gave her 2 lakhs. So it was all reported. Then [Methani] answered that very beautifully, that, "All these things are done, no doubt. I also went to a guru like that and I suffered a lot and all those things, but, these things are not good, they should not be followed. What you you have to follow is Sahaja Yoga," like that. Very good article came. So, you see, they have been successful in some cases. Where it has been really something wrong, they could find out - very few cases like this. But they went up to a hill where there was a lady who was supposed to be curing or something whatever it is, and they burnt her hut. They [breed/buried] all this. They are very violent people. If they don’t find anything they just go amok.

Babamama: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Now, the Christian missionaries, they have been successful because nobody is allowed to propagate religion, like this, in India. So they were successful.

Babamama: Yes.

BM: They were showing a television, on Babhulkar. They were showing him on television.

Shri Mataji: Yes, because, because of Sharad Pawar.

Babamama: Yes. He had shown some instances where you know, in South of Maharashtra there is a village and they believe - all of them in the village - believe that in a particular temple, that at a particular day, on a particular day if they go and hit their head to the wall of the temple, then they will be blessed.

Shri Mataji: No, no, what I am saying, anything like that. Now we had “Devadasis”. We had the problem of [“Nathvara”]. All these problems were there. You see, there were some gurus who were doing wrong things, but they were all corrected by government, not by a... like that.

Babamama: Yes, therefore, therefore there are laws for this.

Shri Mataji: There are laws for that. They have, they have no business to take law into their hand.

Babamama: Absolutely.

Shri Mataji: This is the point I am trying to make.

Babamama: That's right, Shri Mataji. 

Shri Mataji: If the government comes forward we’ll talk to them.

Babamama: Yes... And best they can, they can go to the government and say that this is what is happening. But they cannot do themselves.

Shri Mataji: They cannot do. You see the, the AIG police Pune came to see Me and it said they have no right to do it.

Babamama: Absolutely.

Shri Mataji: And then we have to send the police here and the police there. I mean, they have no bases, but this is Sharad Pawar. And Rajneesh - Rajneesh has started this organisation, to create problems. They have no right. Rajneesh made fun of all the deities, everything, and told that these people worship dogs and things like that.

Babamama: Rajneesh, his very existence, Shri Mataji, is challenged because of Sahaja Yoga, because...

Shri Mataji: That’s true, but what he has done, he has paid the money to start this organisation. Now, last, last two, three years they are there.

Babamama: Initially he was not interested in what we were doing, Shri Mataji. Only when Sahaja Yoga picked up, then...

Shri Mataji: No, initially also they tried to trouble us long time back, in [Israel] country.

Babamama: Rajneesh's people?

Shri Mataji: No, [unclear].

Babamama: [unclear], I see.

Shri Mataji: They hit us. But they told us we are from "Jnana probhodhini". When we inquired, they said, "We have nothing to do with these people." They are all drunkards.

Babamama: Oh yes, they drink. Most of them drink so much.

Shri Mataji: So they are showing Dabholkar. Why not Me? Another thing, Baba, you have to take up with, is with the communication minister, same person, that how could this Paranzape go there, Ram Paranzape, to that remote village to film Me? Why the whole of this television working for these people? Who are they?

Babamama: How did he know that such an event is going to take place?

Shri Mataji: No. no, they are working for him. They always project. Shyam Manav was all the time there, and this fellow was all the time there, Dabholkar and this...

Babamama: Shyam Manav was there?

Shri Mataji: Yes, on the film.

Babamama: Was he there in the... ?

Shri Mataji: He was not there but on the... they show him too much on the television.

Babamama: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So we should meet these central government people on television and why is it so much importance giving to this organisation? And what they said that they will go and open the Samadhi of Gyaneshwara to see if he really went inside or not, to see if there are bones inside or not.

Babamama: Yes. In fact Andha Shraddha Nirmulan should be the first to join Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji, because Sahaja Yoga...

Shri Mataji: I have done so much on this Shraddha Nirmulan.

Babamama: Yes.

Shri Mataji: But what I am saying that how they have got such authority, you should ask.

Babamama: Then they don't have, they have no authority, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: That’s what - we challenged their authority legally.

Babamama: Yes, of course.

Shri Mataji: You see, if the government sees anything wrong... And also you should ask these TV people, why are they giving so much importance to them? They have brought Shyam Manav so many times there. They have got this Dhabolkar there. Why? Who is he? Just an ordinary doctor, a non-practicing doctor. They are the ones who are giving him publicity. They said Shri Mataji is doing a perfect publicity, but they can't say I am doing it for money. They can't find it out. But they are the ones who are seeking publicity. So these people should be, another point, it's very important. You must go and see the central government and ask them how is it, and ask them how is it...

Babamama: That they are showing them on TV.

Shri Mataji: Communication matter.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji. 

Shri Mataji: Delhi people are little bit haphazard. Let them form a committee for this.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji, I will go and meet them all.

Shri Mataji: They are going to see him tomorrow, this gentlemen, the Home minister. Is he also dealing with the communications? They said so.

Babamama: No idea, Shri Mataji. Those ministers have been changing.

Shri Mataji: So this fellow, is he, he's a, he is great friend of Yashwant Sinha.

Babamama: What's his name, Shri Mataji? Sahaya?

Shri Mataji: Sahaya.

Babamama: Sahaya. There have been so many.

Shri Mataji: But you better, you see, you should ask, you should ask them why, how can these people support this organisation? What right have they got? Now supposing somebody is a thief. All right, let the government see to it.

Babamama: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Who are you? Ananda, Andha name... In the name of Andha Shradha they tortured many people. Police are very angry with them because they keep them so busy.

Babamama: Yes. The only thing they can do is to bring it to the notice of the government. 

Shri Mataji: Yes, that's all.

Babamama: That’s all, that’s all. And that’s their legal right - nothing beyond.

Shri Mataji: As if they are cheated themselves.

Babamama: Yes. And if they take to pelting of stones or if they take to any violent act it is totally...

Shri Mataji: That's to be banned.

Babamama: Yes, it's totally illegal.

Shri Mataji: This is the point you have to make. But what should we do now? When are you going to go?

Babamama: I am in Delhi on the 23rd night, Shri Mataji. But I could stay back and...

Shri Mataji: Go there and do it.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: And you should go and meet communication minister.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: And tell he must pass [such strictness]. How can they show Dhabolkar? Who is he?

Babamama: Yes. 

Shri Mataji: That means your, your Police department is bekar [useless]. Your secret police is there bekar. Everybody is bekar. He's the only one most sensible, you know, like a hero in an Indian film.

Babamama: Yes, all wisdom personified.

Shri Mataji: So we have to ask some questions. Already started seeing...

Sahaja yogi: No, these signals, you know.

Shri Mataji: Now take out your watches. Take out your watches. There's no, is very bad. Don’t see your watches. Just take out. I don’t wear. I know the time, Myself. Take out your watches. That makes you mad, you see? You are very time-bound people, and also slaves of your watches. We never had watches before. We were quite happy. Yesterday same thing happened. We had to go to that reception. He became so nervous, his center heart was catching so badly.

Babamama: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: And I Myself suggested that we have to go now. I have a time in My head. I've never missed a plane. I haven't missed anything. And you are not responsible for Me. I am responsible for Myself. Nor also for Sahaja Yoga you are not responsible in a way. But here, in the West, they make a time-bound. Too much of it. But in India is bad manners to see watch in the presence of a saint. It's bad manners. It's sinful actually to see a watch. When you have left everything to the saint, why should you see the watch? And normally also Indians won't see a watch if they are talking to someone, or is regarded as bad manners. Indian bad manners, if you see, you will be shocked. Dhara is her husband, isn't it?  You married Mr. Dhara, isn't it? Who is a lawyer.

Sahaja yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Atul.

Babamama: Atul, yes.

Shri Mataji: All right. Bhoot. This watch must be a bhoot.

Babamama: We should shoebeat it, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Really shoebeat it. Give it a bhandan. Attention, attention is the one. But if you have a proper attention, immediately you know what you have to do, at what time. Like it was at 10.30, but they unnecessarily hurried and we were sitting there for half an hour. And the lady must have thought, "What's the matter with them? Why have they come so early?" One should go and live in Lucknow. You'll never do things in time.
