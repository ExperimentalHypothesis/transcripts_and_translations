Talk to Sahaja Yogis

We have to realize that we are very close, all of us. We are very close. If that is realized, then finished, then you donâ€™t have to bother about anything else.

That is ... we are brothers and sisters ... that is a different point [UNCLEAR now], but this is doing Sahaja Yoga you are.

May God bless you.
