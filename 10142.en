Address to Sahaja Yogis, Chiswick, London (United Kingdom), 2006-08/02

Shri Mataji: We have to realize that we are very close, all of us.
Sir CP: Hum. Yeah. 
Shri Mataji: We are very close. 
If that is realized, then finished! Then you don’t have to bother about anything else.

[Applause from Sir CP]

That is real brothers and sisters, that’s a different point, but this is- it means in Sahaja Yoga you are. 

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi to Sir CP]
Sir CP: Hum? Nothing.
Thanks to all
