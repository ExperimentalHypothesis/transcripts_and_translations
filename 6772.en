Shri Gruha Lakshmi Puja. Sydney (Australia), 7 April 1981.

Today is the anniversary day of the wedding, and I have allowed them to celebrate it because marriage is very important in Sahaja Yoga. It is one of the most important things for Sahaja Yoga, that one should get married. Firstly, marriage always gives you a balance of understanding, if you have proper ideas about marriage. If you have funny ideas, and if you are just marrying for fun’s sake, and you do not understand the value of marriage, then it is just a joke, it’s not a marriage. But in Sahaja Yoga you really understand the value of marriage first of all, what it means. And then, luckily today we are going to have some Sahaja Yoga weddings, in which you will see how we try to conform to the divine laws of marriage, and get married under those laws.

Here I find in Australia as well as in other countries that marriage has lost its sanctity. People don’t understand that by doing sin against the marriage, they are committing such great sins that many generations will have to suffer for this kind of a thing. One has to understand that fidelity is the basis of marriage. If there is no fidelity marriage has no meaning. If you are not capable of being “fidel” , that means you are not yet a human being. A human being has to be a “fidelite”.

In marriage we confirm that the problem is over now, we have finished with the choices we had, and now we are going to settle down with one person. And the sharing of life, in even absolutely private life, is with one person. So you have to be very much harmonized with that person, and in complete understanding and loyalties to each other, one has to develop.

Now the marriage is for the reproduction of the species, as they say. Now as you are another species, you are Sahaja yogis – it’s a new awareness –marriages between you will bring forth children of very high caliber. There are great saints who are anxious to get birth on this Earth, and if they find good Sahaja yogi husband and wife who love each other, are good progressive people in Sahaja Yoga, who are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga, they would be definitely descending on this Earth through you. So it is very important and imminent at this time that one should understand the value, the value of the marriage of Sahaja Yoga.

So many marriages have taken place before also, but what is the validity or what is the credibility of those marriages, when the person who marries them in the name of God is not a realized soul? He has to be a realized soul to marry them. He has no authority to marry in the name of God. All right, registration is a different thing altogether because they do not marry in the name of God, they marry in the name of a nation. But if you have to marry in the name of God, you must have a realized soul to do that. And one should understand every bit of the marriage that is performed, what you are doing, why you are doing. There are certain promises that are to be given. We have taken this marriage system from the old wedding system, also changed it very much according to the Sahaja Yoga, where we have been trying to use all, also certain ceremonies which are done in the churches and other religions, but mainly it is based on the kundalini.

So the promise is to the fire, in this marriage, promise is to the fire; because fire is the one that burns off all that is ugly. And kundalini is also like a fire on one point, because that’s the only energy that rises above. See, so like the fire goes upward, the kundalini also rises upward. That’s why it is compared to the fire. But fire is the energy which is in the stomach, which is the dharma, which is the religion. And the religion of the Sahaja yogis is to keep in the center, not to go to extremes. And when they get married, by their understanding of Sahaja Yoga they pull each other towards the center much more, and enjoy themselves – the present, the present moment, and the present as it is.

Sahaja Yoga marriages can be really fantastic if the Sahaja yogis who marry are sensible, are equally balanced, or are not criticizing each other, not taking an upper hand. It is possible for one Sahaja yogi to marry another one, to gradually upgrade that Sahaja yogi. It is possible also to degrade if a, another Sahaja yogi is more powerful or negative so much that it can degrade also another person. It depends on your quality to be upgraded or degraded.

So marriage is a very big blessing in Sahaja Yoga, because all the, all the gods and all the angels are watching these marriages, and they will see to it that these marriages are successful. But if you are bent upon making them unsuccessful because you still have the same kind of an awareness which you had before, and you want to go to the same, it can fail also like animals, you see. If you live with the animals, even human beings can become like animals. So the Sahaja yogis must know that their awareness is changed, they are different people, they have to live with Sahaja yogis and not with other human beings who are not yet realized. They can talk to them, but they must know that the Sahaja yogis are at a very different level of awareness. If they realize this point, if they understand this simple point that their awareness is very different, they would adjust much better in married life.

There’s no divorce in Sahaja Yoga. We do not think of as divorce, but there’s nothing forced. I mean, if they fail to live together it’s a shame, but so far we have had no divorces. But as the people are coming from every sort of culture and things, there is a possibility that people may like to divorce legally. But in Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like divorce, but there’s no force on anyone. One must try to understand marriage, that it is for your enjoyment. If you cannot your enjoyment, you cannot enjoy the marriage, then it is of no use. In Sahaja Yoga it is to be ensured that people enjoy their marriages, and live very well, happily with each other. It is the responsibility of both the people in Sahaja Yoga.

But say in My case, own case, My husband was not a realized soul, nor did he understood realization, nor was he a seeker. Despite all these ….

[A child comes] (It would like to come to Me for sitting in My lap now!)

… And despite all that, you see, I didn’t get upset or anything, I didn’t push him. I didn’t push anyone. I said, “Gradually he will be able to see it through.”

So even if the person, another person is not a realized soul one can manage it very well, and can live very happily. But in case you get both the people realized, then it’s a much better thing and should be enjoyed. But the interest should be in Sahaja Yoga. If you have other interests then there could be problems, because a Sahaja yogi would not tolerate his wife or a Sahaja yogini would not tolerate her husband to waste his energy on nonsensical things. And a new sort of conflict will start between Sahaja Yoga and the Sahaja yogis and Sahaja yoginis. So it should never be a matter of conflict, because we have so many now ways and methods of finding out what’s the matter with us. And if there is anything wrong with us, we should try to face it and clear it out. We should not try to clear each other’s chakras, but our own. Actually we do not pay attention to ourselves, we start paying attention to others.

Moreover, I must say that Sahaja Yoga marriages will be the most successful marriages – have to be. They will re-establish the institution of marriage on very sound basis. There’s no doubt about it. And those who’ll be married in Sahaja Yoga will be really remarkably happy married couples. But there will be an attack of the negativity on them as soon as they get married, because it is not a very happy thing for these negative forces to see that people are happily married. And they would try their level best to bring all sorts of problems, all sorts of complications in the beginning, to see that these marriages are broken. And when you start playing into their hands you will also be spoiling the chances of getting good realized souls to you, because they would not accept the situation. If you have been quarreling in the beginning also it’s not good, because you go down in their estimation.

So you have to be very patient, very soft and good to each other, to see that you create an atmosphere of invitation for these great souls to come on this Earth. And if that is not so, then they will wait, they will not incarnate, because they don’t want to have parents who are quarreling, who are fighting, who are suspecting, who are troubling each other.

Now, one has to know that Sahaja Yoga marriage has a precise reason. It is not you are marrying just out of fashion; you are marrying because you want to have children who are realized souls, on this Earth to come. We give them a place, parentage to do that. And if you do not understand the value of that marriage, then it is better not to be married in Sahaja Yoga. It’s better to spare the Sahaja Yoga. There’s only one snag in Sahaja Yoga is this, that you are all born of the same Mother, so you are all brothers and sisters in a way. But when you are going to marry each other, then this point becomes a little funny, that how can a brother marry a sister? Now, we can say like that, that I would say that it would be better if you marry not in the same community, but marry from somewhere else. At the most a Sydney Sahaja yogi should marry a Melbourne Sahaja yogi. Some distance should be like that, so that it is kept like not brothers and sisters, should be better.

But I’ve seen when this happens there is more conflict, because they still carry on with the idea that they are from Melbourne and another from – (what do you call it?) – Sydney. (Just I can’t tell them about it) – Sydney. Now the Sydney and Melbourne should not be a matter of conflict. Because as soon as they start quarreling they’ll say, “Oh, you Melburnian, I know you are like that.”

And she’ll say, “You Sydneians, you are like that.”

And immediately you become like that, and you start quarreling about it. So you must know that you are not a Sydneian or a Melburnian, but you are nothing but a Sahaja yogi. And Sahaja yogi has no caste, community or any race, or any, any religion, or also no bar of any nation. Whatever nation you come from, you are a Sahaja yogi, you are a universal being – you are. You can feel the vibrations of anyone sitting down here, whether he’s from Hawaii or from America, doesn’t matter.

So, when you can feel about everyone, that means you are no more belonging to any community or any particular country, you are a universal being. And that’s what we have to do, we have to create more universal beings. And to expedite that, we want to get these great souls on this Earth, so it’s a very important work. They have to be on this Earth, because they are the great channels for this divine work. Once they start descending on this Earth, the real ones, it will all expedite, it will be such a great – you don’t know, it will be such a great sudden explosion of Sahaja Yoga. You’ll be amazed how it can grow faster with these people coming down. And we should try to make such arrangements that we get the real blessings of those people, that they come down on this Earth. It’s very important.

So I would request you to think about the marriage from a new angle and from new ideas by which you can really understand the value, the value of these marriages. And then you make it a successful marriage, and not a failure or a nonsense of it. That’s such a great sinful thing to do, because you are married before realized souls.

So there is no question of being just married like other people are married, and then they, they take a name-plate on their car saying “Just married” – and they go, they are going to a divorce case. There cannot be such a thing for Sahaja Yog – it’s a serious thing. If you are not serious enough about it, better not marry. If you have expectations about marriage, it is better not to marry. It is better not to marry. Nobody is going to force you to marry. Just say, “No, not at all, I’m not going to.” But if you are going to go on like this, you are really be harming Sahaja Yoga in the worst possible way. It is like stabbing Sahaja Yoga from the back.

So there is no need for you to get married, in case you do not want to have it. On the contrary, it would be better that there are many married couples who can produce children, and they can have those great people born to them. But if you think that adjustment and all that means all kinds of these old ideas of married life, it’s better that you do not get married. It’s a new heavenly marriage, for which you should be prepared to receive the beauty and the blessings, and also the greatest of greatest, the ultimate meaning of it.

I hope you will understand that Sahaja Yoga is emphasizing on marriages, and we do not believe in any asceticism, running away from family life. We believe that family life is the most important thing. We have to establish it very well on this Earth, and that we have to see in these beautiful nests of divine love that great souls are born, and we have to continue with it. There’s no escape from having a very good married life. And I wish you, all of you, that you will have a very good happy married life. And those who are not married, I wish them that they also will have a very happy married life.

Now I’ve been married, I think thirty-sixth year is this, My marriage today. There’s so many years have passed but still, I still feel like a bride with My husband, because really we have been very wise people to live like that. And of course there are ups and downs, but ultimately one feels very different about the whole thing. He has sent a beautiful letter today, thanking you all for your kindness shown to Me, and for all the kindness you have shown to him.

So we should have the puja: is today as a Gruha Lakshmi you are worshipping Me. As a Gruha Lakshmi in you and which is very essential also, to worship Me as a Gruha Lakshmi, because you all have a problem with your Gruha Lakshmi. That’s the left Nabhi. So I hope it will work out better for you, and we’ll start with the puja.

After this short puja that we have, then we’ll start with this Devi havan, because this we have not been able to do so far, and this is very important. We have to somehow or other manage it today if possible. We should do thousand Names, would be a very good idea.

Sahaja Yogi:  is destroyed, it is he who remains.
“Sarvam Jagadidam twat tas tish thati” When the all body
Shri Mataji : No.  “Tish thati” means it stays in it. The whole world stays because of You. As long as You are there, the world will stay.
[about a dog?]Let him be, let him be. That’s not so very–. Sit down, sit down, sit down.
When You are completely, the whole world is destroyed, that time also, You are there. You are the witness.
Sahaja Yogi:  “Twayi Pratyeti”
Shri Mataji : “Twayi Pratyeti” Everybody can only experience You and nothing else.
 
Sahaja Yogi:  If you have any experience of the Divine it is because of him.
Shri Mataji : Him, through Him, through Him.
Sahaja Yogi:  “Twam Bhoomi rapo nalo nilo Nabhah” He is the soil, he is
Shri Mataji : The water. He is the akasha. Nala means fire.

Shri Mataji : All the elements.
Sahaja Yogi:  “Twam Chatvari Vak Padani.” ….
Shri Mataji : Guided by Him. There are, you see, four stages of your sound, you see, when they – para, pashanti, madhyama. You see, there are four stages of your sound that starts from here. You see, the sound starts from here [Shri Mataji shows her stomach]. This is para. Sound starts from para, from here it starts. [Shri Mataji shows her stomach]. Then it goes to pashanti, the heart just pulsate. But it is “pashanti”, means it is just watching. Here it is madhyama [Shri Mataji shows her throat]. It is the center, means it doesn’t, neither watch nor this thing. And then, at the mouth part, becomes eloquent. So all these four stages of the sound are governed by You, by You.
Sahaja Yogi:  “Twam Guna traya teetah. Twam Deha traya teetah. Twam Kala traya teetah. Twam Mooladhara sthitosi Nityam. Twam Shakti trayat makah. Twam Yogino Dhyayanti Nityam. Twam Brahma, Twam Vishnus, Twam Rudras, Twam Indras, Twam Agnis, Twam Vayus, Twam Suryas, Twam Chandramas. Twam Brahma bhur bhuvah Swarom.”
…He is beyond all the gunas, that means, beyond all the virtues.
Shri Mataji : No, no, “gunas virtues nahi”[Gunas are not virtues]. Gunas means moods, moods, moods; qualities. You see, “tamo guna and rajo guna and satya guna” He’s beyond them, He transcended. You see, for Him there’s nothing like sin, whatever He does is divine.
Sahaja Yogi:  “Twam Deha traya teetah”
Shri Mataji :  You are beyond Your body.
Sahaja Yogi:  “Twam Kala traya teetah”
Shri Mataji :  You are beyond time.
Sahaja Yogi:  “Twam Mooladhara sthitosi Nityam.” Now Mooladhara means, the Mooladhara of the universe.
Shri Mataji :  Mooladhara Chakra.
Sahaja Yogi:  Mooladhara Chakra of the universe. There he resides.
Shri Mataji :  resides.
Sahaja Yogi:  “Twam Shakti trayat makah”

Shri Mataji :  Upon You. All the time. ….
Sahaja Yogi:  “Nityam” means everytime.
“Twam Brahma”, you are Brahma

Sahaja Yogi :  Agni he is the fire. He is the wind, he is the Sun, he is the Moon.
“bhur bhuvah Swarom”
Shri Mataji :  He is the sound of God – Omkara.
Sahaja Yogi :  “Ganadim Poorva much charya. Varna dim Tada nan taram. Anus varah Para tarah. Ardhendu lasitam, Tare na Ruddham. Etat tava Manuswa roopam. 
Gakarah Poorva roopam. Akaro Madhyama roopam. Anuswarash chantya roopam. 
Bindu ru tara roopam. Nada Sandha nam. Sanhita Sandhih. Saisha Ganesha Vidya. 
Ganaka Rishihi. Nich rid Gayatri Chandah.Ganapatir Devata. Om Gam Ganapataye Namah.”
Sahaja Yogi :  …. Every aspect of Omkara is he himself.
Shri Mataji :  He’s the assemblage of all that….Gana means all the, all the celestial beings on the left-hand side are called as ganas, you see? They are – the leader of them is St. Michael. So He is even before them, He’s born even before them. He’s even higher than them.
Sahaja Yogi :  “Varna dim Tada nan taram.”
Shri Mataji :  You see, this is what is Alpha and Omega: that He is, He’s the first word that is created, and He is the last word, He’s above the last word that is created, “Varana”.
Sahaja Yogi :  ….There is a stage after Realization which is supposed to be
Shri Mataji :  Above it
Sahaja Yogi :  Above Sahasrara, is ardhenbindu sthiti, bindu sthiti and vale sthiti. So from bindu sthiti, all the sthitis, all the stages, from bindu sthiti onward, there are something like 14 stages above. All the stages are governed by him…
“Tare na Ruddham.”
Shri Mataji :  The one who gives you salvation. 
 You see the vibrations - I don’t know if you can see them- it looks like a comma – “anusvarah” is commas. So that’s how You reside like little, little commas; if you can see them ….
See, the complete Omkara is: first is Ga-karah, is Ganapati, Ga. “Ga-karah purva-rupam”: the first is - you see, You take the form of Ganesha in the beginning, “purva-rupam” – Ganesha is in them. Then You take the form of Omkara. And the last is when You become just a comma.
Sahaja Yogi : … If you have to learn him from the sound, then Shri Ganesha vidya, then that knowledge, the knowledge of learning through the sound, is known as Shri Ganesha vidya.
Shri Mataji :  Sound is mantras, you see. To know Him through the mantras, you have to learn the Ganesha-vidya, is the knowledge of Jesus. If you have to know the mantras, you have to know through the knowledge, that the whole science is called, is the knowledge of Ganesha. Or you can call the vidya of Ganesha, means the technique of Ganesha. And if you have to know how the mantras work out, this is the science. The science is called as Ganesha-vidya, is all His science.
Sahaja Yogi :  …The one who masters this knowledge is Ganaka-rishihi
Shri Mataji :  He, that’s why He’s called as Ganaka, Ganaka-rishihi, that’s why He’s called, because He’s the master of that. He’s the master of the art of mantras, the sounds.
Sahaja Yogi:  “Nich rid Gayatri Chandah.”
Shri Mataji :  Chandah. It’s a mantra – Gayatri is one of the mantras, you see. And it’s on the right-hand side. Chandah is … music of all the mantras. The rhythm, rhythm, rhythm [taala]. You see, you have to say mantras with a certain rhythm, and He’s the rhythm.
Sahaja Yogi :  “Ganapatir Devata.” The Lord himself is Ganesha.
“Om Gam Ganapataye Namah.”
Shri Mataji :  How to, how to  awaken this deity.
Sahaja Yogi :  For that the mantra has been given. “Om Gam Ganapataye namah” this is the mantra for awakening this deity.
“Eka Dantaya Vidmahe.
Vakra Tundaya Dheemahi.
Tanno Dantih Prachodayat.”

Shri Mataji : Is one of the loops. See, He controls you with a loop. If you try to misbehave, then He puts a loop round you and pulls you back – pash-

Shri Mataji : Red clothes.
Sahaja Yogi : “Rakta gandhanu liptangam.” It should be red on the forehead and on the body. Even on the body, he would like to put red safran the red one.
Shri Mataji : At least on this chakra, we should put red. [Shri Mataji shows the Agnya chakra]
Sahaja Yogi : “Rakta pushpaihi Supoojitam.” Means he likes the red flowers.
Shri Mataji : That’s why ….
Sahaja Yogi : That’s why you brought am those red flowers for the puja…
“Bhaktanu Kampitam Devam” For the devotees, he has a tremendous compassion…
The compassion that flows from him is for the universal good.
“Aavir bhutam Cha Shristyadau. Prakritehe Purushat param.” He comes on the earth to give emancipation to the human beings, and that’s how He manifests, even as a human being.
Shri Mataji : See.
Sahaja Yogi : “Evam Dhya yati Yo Nityam. Sa Yogi Yoginam Varah.” A Yogi.
Shri Mataji : Good Yogi, not “a yogi”. No, no, “a yogi” means anybody who is going to church: that’s not a Yogi. See, a Yogi_

Sahaja Yogi : So the connexion by which you know the Divine is known as Yoga….
Shri Mataji : Yoga. You see, “evam dhyayati” means “by which you know”.
Sahaja Yogi : Such Yogi worships this Lord Ganesha or Lord Jesus in the fashion by meditation.
Shri Mataji : Only the Yogis, again.
Sahaja Yogi : “Namo Vratapataye. Namo Ganapataye. Namaha Pramatha Pataye. Namaste Astu Lambodaraya, Ekadantaya, Vighna Nashine, Shiva sutaye, Shree Varada moortaye Namah.” Here, such divine personality, I bown to you,

Sahaja Yogi : …There are only eight slokas, eight stanzas, very small.
Bolo Shri Bhagavati Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai!
Shri Mataji : So this is nothing to understand Him. But just this is said, is just in the beginning.
To make it …. Atharva Devi […] You have got this Book in English? No?

[note]
I notice at the end of the talk that Shri Mataji is a bit annoyed by the ego of the Indian Sahaja Yogi who chanted and explained Atharva Shirsha. :-))
In fact, the Yogi made a "mistake" between Sadashiva and Shiva when he said "Ganesha is the child of the Spirit". He extrapolated because this is not what is written, literally. So Shri Mataji corrected him. Unfortunately, when Shri Mataji wanted to explain the difference between Sadashiva and Shiva, he did not let Her speak. It is for this reason that She added Sadashiva is God Alamighty as it is under this form that He is the Spirit of the universe.
