Radio Inteview. Vienna (Austria), 27 September 1982.

Interviewer: Mother, You are an Indian, now what kind of following do You have at home?

Shri Mataji: Now, there are lots of people in the villages of India. I work in the villages of India and not so much in the cities. And the villages are not yet touched by the superficialities and pretentious of life so much. People are very simple and it's easy to get them realized. I mean the Self Realization, the Spirit. They can feel it much faster than others can. It works much faster there and it has improved their lives to a very great extent. Because of this happening within your self you get cured. And there was a possibility of starting even a national health scheme on those grounds because you don't have to pay anything for it. And also you give up all your bad habits like drinking, smoking and there are other blessings that also follow with it. So it's a very great thing because you don't have to pay anything for the countries which are developing now.

Interviewer: Of course there are many flint religions in Britain. And indeed in this trouble times they are growing there are more people who are turning to religious experiences of one kind or another. But what is so special about Yours? Is it another established church?

Shri Mataji: No, it is not. It is not an established one, it is neither an organized one. It is something very natural within us, spontaneous. It is the breakthrough of our evolutionary process, the last one. We have a meaning, we human beings are created for a meaning for certain purpose. We are not purposeless. And the evolution has taken place, has brought us to this level of human awareness. And we have to breakthrough to become the awareness of the spirit. It has been said by all the scriptures. I am not here to deny any scriptures or any religion that was established. But by this you understand that they all are belonging to one universal power, while we are fighting because of our ignorance. It is the very integrating thing. It transcends all the races, all the nations and all these barriers which human beings in their ignorance have created.

Interviewer: Now You are the spiritual head of this movement. Now how can You spread the word and the gospel of Your message when You have no organized church, it must be rather difficult?

Shri Mataji: Not at all. Because there are seekers, as you said that the people here are very complicated. And sometimes this confusion gives them a greater seeking than that is in India. Because people in the developing countries are seeking now material value but the people where they are affluent, they are seeking the spiritual value. So lots of seekers are born in these places and it's easy, very easy to talk to them and this can work out.

Interviewer: Shri Mataji, You are said to have these gifts. I mean how do You react to that. Don't You think it's little dangerous? There are a lot of people should just look to You as an individual. It's got a responsibility, isn't it?

Shri Mataji: Its like the sun, the sun does not feel anything is dangerous. And it just emits, what can I do about it? I mean, if you could do it I would be very happy. But it's not so. I have to do it, what to do.

Interviewer: Are You saying that there is something special with You? Or could any of us or could I develop this?

Shri Mataji: No, you can get it also.

Interviewer: Can we pass this on to another people?

Shri Mataji: Yes of course, you see one light can enlighten another person. Now-a-days these boys are curing others and they are doing all these work. I can't go everywhere. Its done like that. You become that, you become collectively conscious yourself.

Interviewer: Well I am not sure what if, what it is going to make of this, at least there is something in it but I don't know!

Shri Mataji: Why not try, why not try.
