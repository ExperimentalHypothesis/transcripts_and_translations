Short Conversation on Marriages, India, Dehli [?] December [?].

Shri Mataji: Now, you see the thing is, how many are really settled for marriage? Raise your hand.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s Chandra and Matti.
Shri Mataji: Not yet.
Sahaja Yogi: Not yet.
Shri Mataji: Not yet. That’s not yet settled, because you see, he has still problems with government. I’ve seen with him very frankly: unless and until you fully sort it out, you are not to be married. Because I don’t want him to loose his job, alright? 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: You see, if he looses his job, if he has to resign and go away it’s not proper. 
Sahaja Yogi: That’s right.
