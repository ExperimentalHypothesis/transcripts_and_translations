Public Program. Linz (Austria), 26 July 1992.

Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot think about it and we cannot conceptualize it. And at this human awareness we cannot feel it. So to know the reality we have to become a subtler personality, the spiritual personality. That means we have to become the Spirit. 


Now whatever we are telling you here need not be accepted blindfolded, but should be accepted as a hypothesis, with a open mind like a scientist and if it is proved, then you have to accept it as truth. Because it is for your benevolence and for the benevolence of your country and the whole world. Most of the world problems come from human beings and most of the human problems come from these centers when they are somehow or other disturbed. 


This is a very special time, I call it the Blossomtime. Some people call it Last Judgment or in the Koran it's called as Kiyama, means Resurrection Times. Also some call it as Age of Aquarius. According to Indian scriptures these are Kali Yuga. And this scripture says that, "At this time human beings will be very much confused and they will find the reality." 


Now every human being is innately born with Divinity within himself, in a potential state. This Divinity all the time gives you a faith in a higher life. But this faith gets challenged later on as we grown on. The first challenge comes when we see that the religions are money-oriented or power-oriented. And they are not Spirit-oriented. They want to collect money or to collect power. 


The second challenge comes to us through science. Science goes to a point to say, "There is no God, there is no Divinity, there is no spiritual life." Science itself doesn't talk of ascent. Science is not conclusive. It goes on changing all the time and solves very mundane materialistic problem. Even science when it goes to the extreme it boomerangs on us. So through science we have created lots of problems. We have created atombomb, hydrogenbomb, these ecological problems, but still we believe in science because it is so visible. Of course there is science but it cannot take you to reality. It cannot give you that jump to breakthrough through your evolutionary process. 


The third challenge comes - specially in the West - through the so called intellectuals like Freud. About - since at least 22 years I've been telling that this Freud theory is very dangerous. Now a book has come out, a very scholarly book written by a very scholarly doctor and he says that all this is hocus-pocus. He has discussed the malignant effect of Freudian - he calls him "Fraudulent Freud". But it's too late now, according to him also people are already finished with it. Let us see how Freud became so important and worshipped like Christ, in the West.


Can you hear her there? Can you hear her? 


The first thing was the idea of original sin. William Blake, a great poet said that this idea has come through the head of some satan. According to this theory everyone of us is a sinner, all the incarnations like Shri Krishna, Shri Rama - they were sinners. Prophets like Mohammed, Nanaka, Lao-Tze - all of them were sinners. When this kind of an artificial idea is pushed onto your head then natural things start coming out and that's how they took to Freud. That is how Freud became a very great person. Now what he has given us according to this book is AIDS and all kinds of secret diseases which are dangerous. Thus we have to introspect our society. Child abuse is so common, [UNCLEAR: in-sex / insane ?] relationships are so common, because of this free love business. And I don't know why people accepted him. I mean, if he had come to India he would have been killed. Nobody would have listened to him. (Shri Mataji laughing) Because Indian culture comes from saints, from seers. And they would not listen to all such nonsense. 


The fourth domination comes to us from entrepreneurs. Like recently in Paris they said that ladies should wear only six inches of skirts, (Shri Mataji laughing) and nobody could wear long skirts. This kind of idea people immediately accept, without even thinking how it will harm us to our body. In England a fad came out for Punks. All started painting their hair and they became blind, some of them. Every month they were paying 50 to 100 pounds to paint their hair. And when I asked them, "Why do you do it? You are all becoming blind." They said, "What's wrong in becoming blind?" So this is how we are playing into the hands of these people who are not interested in our benevolence but interested in exploiting us. 


In addition to that we have other problems which are very serious like drugs. They said that in Amsterdam one million people take to drugs and thousands are killed with AIDS. So we should find out at least if there is a solution? Solution to this problems. Are we going to get destroyed completely? Are we created only to get destroyed? There must be a purpose in our evolution. And the purpose within us is to ascend. To ascend into a realm of God's Kingdom. 


There is a complete system built in within us during our evolutionary process which has been already explained to you. So there are two truths which you should know. One is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit. And the second truth is that there is a All pervading Power of Divine Love, which does all the living work. We see these flowers so beautiful, we take them for granted. We don't even think, what a miracle they are. Look at our eyes, what a miraculous camera. Look at our brain, what a great computer. Who runs your heart? They say autonomous nervous system. But who is this auto? 


So the first thing you should have is self knowledge. You should know about yourself not only mentally but innately. And how do you know? Is a very simple thing. Innately within you this beautiful system is built in. And whatever you might have done, whatever so called mistakes you might have committed this system is absolutely intact, nothing is lost. Your innocence is intact, your Divinity is intact, because it is eternal. Nothing can destroy it. Is all within you. And these are the special times when you have to know it. 


What is the Nature of Spirit? First of all let us see what happens when this Kundalini rises through these six centers and pierces through your fontanel bone area. She is your individual Mother. She knows everything about you and when She rises She nourishes these centers. She integrates them. Thus your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being comes into balance. It is nourished and it starts manifesting its nourishment. No doubt, by the ascent of the Kundalini people have been cured of very serious diseases like cancer, blood cancer. And once you get established you cannot get any diseases easily. Because this Kundalini attaches you, which is yoga, unites you with this All-pervading Power. And this All-pervading Power starts nourishing you with all vitality. As this instrument should be connected to the mains we are to be connected to the mains. Many people say that, "We pray to God but it is of no avail." But you are not connected. If your telephone is not connected how can you get connection? This connection is what we call Yoga, means the union. It is not standing on your head. In the Patanjali yoga is a very wee part which we can also practice sometimes. When there is a physical problem on the spinal cord we may also little bit use it. 


But the Kundalini is awakened spontaneously - means Sahaja. Sahaja means born with you. As a seed sprouts spontaneously this Kundalini also is awakened spontaneously. You can't pay for it. It's a living process as in the seed there is a built in quality to sprout. And as the Mother Earth has the built in quality to sprout the seed. It works spontaneously. You don't have to read anything. It's very simple. Also it has become very much simpler, because as I said this is a Blossomtime. As many of you have to ascend into that realm of complete reality. We live in the relative world but when we get connected with this absolute power we know the absolute truth. You start feeling a kind of a Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost as this power. You can feel them on your fingertips. And if you know how to decode what you are feeling on your fingertips you know what they mean. It's an innate knowledge. You know about yourself, about your centers and also you know about others. Thus you jump into a new awareness what we call as collective consciousness. Sitting down here you can find out what's wrong with the chakras of anyone. Even anyone who is dead. So thus you know about yourself. Now if you know how to correct your centers you are all right! And if you know how to correct the centers of others then there is no problem. 


The Spirit is the universal being within us. And we experience that all the religions were created on the same Tree of Spirituality. Then you respect every religion. Thus fundamentalism is finished. There is no race problem, no boundaries because you become a universal being. Sahaja Yoga is working in 55 nations and they are all become your brothers and sisters. This is the state that we call as a saint. But you become a saint, it's not that you are forced into it, you just become. You become righteous, you become dynamic, at the same time extremely compassionate. 


This happening is so simple without any trouble. This power is your own. As just one light can enlighten another light, you can also after your enlightenment enlighten other people. Your attention becomes active. That means when you put your attention to something then it acts there. Because it touches the universal cosmic power. Like the ether. And you are amazed about the miracles that you can create. You are amazed at your own glory. And you cannot believe it, you cannot believe it that you are performing all these beautiful acts. The best of all is that you jump into the Ocean of Joy. Joy has no duality like unhappiness and happiness, it is absolute. 


I agree that so far very few have felt the reality but this modern Sahaja Yoga is for en-masse Realization. Apart from India, in Russia we get people sixty thousand to eighty thousand. And they get all their Realization. You all should have full confidence that tonight you are all going to get your Self Realization. I know some of you are overly read, they have read too much, and they have so many questions in their heads. 


You see these beautiful lights here. You have to just press one button and all the lights are coming, because it is all built in. If I start telling you about the history of electricity and then how it was brought to Linz you will be bored stiff. So the best thing is to have the lights on. Of course there are thousands of My lectures which you can listen to, but just now I think best is to have your Realization. In this one visit this Ocean of Knowledge cannot be expressed. But when you become the Spirit you jump into the Ocean of Knowledge and then you know what is the truth and what is not, because you develop a Divine discretion. 


But one thing I must tell you that Sahaja Yoga cannot be done individually. It is a collective happening like a microcosm becomes the macrocosm. Like you become part and parcel of one whole. Like if this finger has a problem the whole body helps it. In this collective happening you are all the time helped, looked after and is a thing of concern for everyone. 


So today - tonight those who want to have their Realization should stay back. It will take hardly 10 to 15 minutes at the most. But those who do not want should leave the hall because I cannot force it on you, it cannot be forced. Because I respect your freedom. To achieve the ultimate freedom I have to respect your freedom. You have to ask for it otherwise I cannot force on you.


All those who have questions in their mind can also write it down and tomorrow in Vienna we have a program I'll answer them. For the time being try to get your Self Realization. 


The first state you achieve is called as thoughtless awareness. We are living in the past or in the future, but we cannot live in the present. All the thoughts are bombarding us from left or right, from the past and the future. After Realization there's a place in between the past and the future and you stand in the present. At that time you are thoughtless, but completely aware. Now whenever you want to think you can think, whenever you don't want to think you are in silence. Thus you attain peace within yourself. There are so many things that you have to experience, you get vitality. Now you won't believe I am 70 years of age and I'm travelling every day. When this energy is flowing all the time, what is there to be tired? 


So now again I will request those who do not want to have Self Realization should leave the hall and not to disturb others. It will give you no trouble, no problem. 


I'm so happy to see that in this place there are so many seekers of truth. And if you are genuine and honest I'm sure you'll all get your Realization. So please have full confidence. 


We have three conditions before we start. They are very simple conditions. The first one is that you have to be absolutely confident about yourself. The second one is not to feel guilty about anything whatsoever. If you have done any mistakes after all you are human beings, you are not Gods. And if one makes mistakes you should face it, what's the use of being guilty and torturing yourself? Moreover physically defects, it gives you spondylitis, it can give you angina, it can give you lethargic organs. Because this is the center on the left hand side gets completely ruined. Don't believe people who call you sinners and all that. You are seekers of truth and you have every right to find the truth. 


The third condition is even simpler. The third condition is that you must forgive everyone. Forgive everyone in the sense that logically we can understand that whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But when you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. Those who have troubled you are very happy, but you are torturing yourself on their behalf. Now, the center on the optic chiasma inside the brain is like this - absolutely like a constricted cross. Constricted. Now if you don't forgive it won't open. And the Kundalini won't go through it. As it is you have tortured yourself by not forgiving and now you'll miss your Self Realization by not forgiving. But if you really forgive, it will open like that. Also don't think of them, because it's a headache to think of them. You must forgive in general. Not to think of anyone, forgive everyone of them. It's not worth it. 


So now first we'll show you how you have to nourish your centers yourself. Then you'll have to close your eyes and the Kundalini will, I'm sure, will connect you to the Divine. It will pierce through your fontanel bone area and you'll get the actualization - actualization of baptism. I'm saying again actualization, not just a sermon lecture and somebody putting his hand here, no, it's actualization. 


Aside: Better to open the doors on the sides, because it's very hot for them, I think.


Now you'll have to take out your shoes if you don't mind, because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. Not only She helps us in farming but She helps us in our ascent. She absorbs all our negativity.


Now as he has told you the left side and the right side we have to know that we have two powers. Left side is the power of desire, ordinary desire. And Kundalini is the pure desire. And the right side is the power of action. So those who are sitting on the ground are all right, but those who are sitting on the chair should put their both the feet apart from each other. 


Now you have to put your left hand towards Me like this. This is symbolic that you want to have your Self Realization. That it is your desire. Then you have to use your right hand for nourishing your centers. So you have to use your right hand in a way that you first put your right hand on your heart where resides the Spirit. If you become the Spirit you become your own guide, your own master. So please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of your mastery, which was created by great prophets in the past. 


Now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, lower most. This is the center for your pure knowledge. Pure knowledge of Divine power which works through this center surprisingly. Now, again you raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, then raise your right hand on your heart. 


Now please put your right hand on your heart and then now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. I have already told you that this center catches when you feel guilty. Turn your head to your right please. 


Now take your right hand on top of your forehead and put your right hand on top of your forehead and bend your head as far as possible. This is the center where you have to forgive everyone. 


Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. This is the center for you to ask forgiveness from the Divine power without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction. 


Now take your right hand and stretch it fully. Now the last center. Put the right hand, the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area and put down your head as far as possible. Now put down your head as far as possible. Now you can move your scalp with a pressure 7 times. 


That's all we have to do. That's all. Please remember to push back your fingers so there's a good pressure on your scalp. 


All right. Now you have to close your eyes, but you can take out your spectacles and don't open them till I tell you. Now again please put both your feet apart from each other and put the left hand towards Me. We are only working on the left hand side. Now please put your right hand on your heart. Please close your eyes. Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. So ask the question in your heart three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"


I've told you that if you are the Spirit you become your master. So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Here you ask another question. Three times please ask in your heart, "Mother, am I my own master?" 


Now I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force Divine pure knowledge on you. So please now put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. And ask Me six times because there are six petals, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts moving upward, so you have to open your upper centers with self confidence. 


Without doubting yourself please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say with full confidence 10 times, "Mother, I am my own master." 


I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings but you are pure Spirit. So now please raise your right hand on top of your heart. And here with full confidence you have to say 12 times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit." 


You have to know that this All pervading Divine Power is the Ocean of Knowledge. It is the Ocean of Compassion and Bliss, but above all it is the Ocean of Forgiveness and whatever mistakes you might commit can be easily dissolved by the power of this Ocean of Forgiveness. So now please raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here now with full confidence you have to say 16 times, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." 


I've already told you that logically whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything, but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. And we have to forgive so that our Agnya chakra opens. So now please put your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say with full confidence from your heart, not how many times, from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Do it from your heart. 


Now you have to take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here again from your heart not counting how many times please say, "Oh Divine Power, forgive me if I've done anything wrong." Please do not count your mistakes and don't feel guilty, is for your satisfaction you have to say, from your heart. 


Now, please stretch your hand fully, your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of - on your fontanel bone area. Please put down your heads. Now push back your fingers, please push back your fingers. Don't hold your head, push back your fingers so there is a good pressure on your scalp. And now please move your scalp seven times. But here again I cannot take away your freedom, you have to ask for Self Realization. So please say 7 times moving clockwise, "Mother, please give me Self Realization." 


(Shri Mataji blowing into microphone)


Now please take down your hands. Please open your eyes. Put both the hands towards Me like this. Now watch Me without thinking. Like this, like this, not higher like this. Watch Me without thinking. Now please put right hand like this, bend your head and with the left hand see if there's a Cool or a hot Breeze like waves coming out of your fontanel bone area. Don't put your hand on top of the head but away from it, some people get it further. Bend your head. 


Now please put your left hand towards Me, again bend your head properly. And see with right hand if there is a cool or a hot air like waves coming from your brain, from your head, feel it with the right hand. If you are not forgiven, it will be also hot. So forgive now. 


Again once more put your right hand towards Me, please put down your head, and see with the left hand. 


Now you have to put both your hands towards the sky like this and push back your head. And ask one of these three questions, anyone of them three times which I'll tell you. One of them is, "Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost?" The second one is, "Mother, is this the All pervading Power of Divine Love?" And the third one is, "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?" Ask anyone of these three questions. Anyone of them three times. 


Now please take down your hands. Please put your hands like this. You will feel very relaxed and thoughtless, thoughtlessly aware. All those who have felt Cool or hot Breeze on their fingertips or through their fontanel bone area or on their palms please raise both your hands. 


Those who have felt Cool Breeze out of their head or on their fingertips or hot - hot or cool, please raise both your hands. Both your hands. 


I bow to all the people who are here from Austria, you have entered into the Kingdom of God. Your saintly life has started, enjoy your peace within. We have a very nice center here and people who know a lot about Sahaja Yoga. They'll tell you all about the Divine knowledge, every aspect of it. This is your own. There is no obligation of any kind. Please respect your Self Realization. 


May God bless you!

Shri Mataji: When I was coming here to this beautiful place, I tell you, I was amazed. We have come to the most beautiful place I could expect. Such wonderful seekers.
