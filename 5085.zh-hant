威廉‧布萊克展覽中的講話

1985年11月28日 英國

我們今天很榮幸,能對這個偉大的詩人、畫家和先知威廉‧布萊克(William Blake)致敬。我初來英國時,有人告訴我,英國是學術文化薈萃之地,有很多博物館,可以看很多展覽。有一天,我對那些霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者說,我想到某展覽館看威廉‧布萊克的畫。他們都覺得很驚奇,因為我很少去看展覽,特別少去圖書館及看書。我去到的時候,我看見這位偉大詩人的畫,他以真誠關切之心,以他對上天深切的了解,去告知英國的人民,上天的力量如何偉大。但我在看時,卻發現有些愚蠢的人,拿著放大鏡,看畫中人物的私處,他們還拍照,他們對上天毫無了解。於是我想到布萊克在世時,與這些人在一起,一定是受了許多苦楚。他一定曾經在荒野裡哭泣。那時的人根本不可能接受他,那些低俗的心靈根本沒可能了解超越和偉大的心靈。我的心痛起來。主啊!為甚麼要他降生在這樣的一個地方,叫他受苦,叫他說一些人們根本不可能接受的話。

但我知道他是誰,他要做甚麼,為甚麼他要生在那裡。我們對他所知不多,因為關於他的書,讀了也沒有甚麼用,也不會知道他是誰。他是個降世神祇,是左脈神祇巴爾伐亞(Bhairava),或稱左天使長聖米迦勒(St. Michael)的降世。他也是英國的守護天使。他因此而降世,他要在世上毫無畏懼地宣示上天的知識。他必須要用象徵性的語言,如果你是個已得到自覺的靈,便不難明白他。於是你便能隨著他哭,隨著他笑,隨著他觀看這一齣世界的戲劇。

當我讀他的詩時,我很驚奇他的幽默感,我想他就像印度的詩人默根迪亞和迦比爾。他們都勇敢無懼的譏評社會,他們都是很公開,很直接,直率的說出來,但同時有很溫柔的一面。布萊克用他受啟發的眼睛看教會,發覺他們所行的,剛剛與基督的教導相反。我也是這樣覺得,我生長在基督教家庭,我對基督徒的行為感到震驚,不禁要問:這些是基督徒嗎?問題很簡單,有些人的溫柔只是種客套。好像很多人愛說:「我恐怕...」「我猜...」。布萊克說,耶穌基督不是那種好好先生。我也常常說:我不是在作競選,不是在討好你們,我要令你們找到自己,享受自己,找到自己的寶貴財富。

因此布萊克描繪的耶穌基督,不會到處討好別人。這都是表面的。但耶穌對那些低下的人很溫柔,他使那些漁夫,那些沒有受過教育的人,變成聖徒。這些人原來是社會中最低下的。耶穌基督並沒有去找那些高高在上的統治者。你們看那些執掌宗教的人,只有興趣找那些王侯將相,向他們鞠躬禮拜。來自上天的人,怎會對人間這種政治有興趣?

我們都不明白這點,我們將一切都理性化,幸好布萊克出來批評這種理性。現在有許多知識分子,把耶穌基督貶低為凡人,因為布萊克本身是屬於上天的,所以能明白耶穌。布萊克常常受人逼害,有時會陷入情緒低落之中。而且他有金錢的問題,及來自兄弟姊妹的問題,人人都令他難受。

這樣一個優美的靈魂來到世上,給世人宣示耶路撒冷的來臨。耶路撒冷是甚麼意思?在西方,耶穌基督被抑貶為普通的凡人。今人對耶穌基督的描繪,令我感到震驚。他們從那裡獲得這個形象?他們到底有沒有眼睛?他們是瞎眼的嗎?你們的主教、大主教都這樣說。他們對神是無所畏懼的嗎?如果你們這樣評論耶穌,你們的國家會變成怎樣?現在有些繪畫和電影,把耶穌描繪成毫無道德的人,把祂的母親描繪為沒穿衣服的,那是不敬的。就算布萊克把人畫成是赤裸的,但神不會是赤裸的,那是一種尊重。現在那些所謂知識份子的所作所為,只會帶來上天的震怒。

布萊克是個印刷人,為甚麼他要做個印刷人呢?他曾描繪那些書如何在地獄中生產,如何在每一個輪穴中製造出一個魔怪,然後被放在圖書館中。因此我也不喜歡看書。為甚麼他要做個印刷人呢?這是很重要的,我們需要知道。為甚麼他要這樣多的談論印刷呢?你們看今日的傳播媒介,這便是布萊克所說的魔怪之一。那些傳播媒介令你盲目相信,賺你們的錢,同時使你們和你們的子女變得更弱,有系統地令社會徹底破壞。布萊克希望抵抗這些傳媒,因此他才成為印刷人,從根源處去打擊他們。不論我們是否喜歡,傳媒正日漸壯大。今日的傳媒,令人無法明白,他們對我們的根,對我們的命運,對我們的超越理想,造成多大傷害。

有一次電視台邀請我作訪問,我很震驚,他們說英美人士不可能明白與錢無關的事情。我說你們先要得到自覺,否則我便不來接受訪問。這便是耶穌基督所作的,他大可以一天到晚呆在那些大人物處,或跪下求情,要求寬恕。寧願被釘在十字架上,那表示甚麼?那表示那些愚蠢的人,把一個偉大的人釘死了。

因此我說布萊克是個偉大的先知,他預言道:如果你們不返回正途,如果你們不求向上昇進,所有的都要發生。這是關於我們的,是要發生在我們身上的,發生在我們家庭之上的,發生在我們子女身上的,發生在我們社會之上的,發生在我們國家上的。且讓我們勇敢面對。上天的愛,對那些麻木的心靈來說,也是沒有效用的。

霎哈嘉瑜伽一早已來到世上,遠在我降世以前已來到了。今天霎哈嘉瑜伽在印度開始,我來英國不過十二年。布萊克花了十四年時間寫出耶路撒冷詩篇,如果到了十四年的時候,在這片他希望建立耶路撒冷之地,我們能做出一點工作,我便對你們感激不盡了。

但現況卻令人失望,上天的話他們聽不入耳,人們只喜歡自己愛聽的話。你要討好他們,利用他們的弱點,說他們做的壞事都是好事。耶穌的愛與慈悲可以成就奇蹟,這是無可懷疑的,因為耶穌基督是為我們而降生的,整個宇宙是為我們創造的。我們要去接受上天的祝福,我們都要成為永恆的靈,就是你們說的得到重生。但從歷史,從周圍環境而來的思想積習,深深地束縛著我們,使我們忘記我們要將眼睛望向天上。布萊克的一生是另一次的被釘上十字架,我常為此淚流不已。

......

他說耶穌基督不理會祂的父母,十二歲那年便離家出走。不是說現在十二歲的兒童都離家出走,並去吸毒,因此我們可以因此而尊崇基督。耶穌說:「這是我天父的事業,我為甚麼要擔心我的父母?」那不是說你們都不要孝順父母,而是你要追求更高的事物,走不同的方向。你走這個方向,要過平衡的生活,但我是要追求昇進的。這是他要給你們清楚展示的訊息。無論他說得多麼有愛心,多麼溫柔,多麼謙卑,你們是要昇進的,要成為永恆的靈。

我告訴你們許多次,英國是宇宙中一片很重要的地方,不知有多少個英國人知道,英國是宇宙的心輪。但現在我們在這心輪處得到些甚麼?如果耶穌今天來英國,會被拒入境,因為他不是英國人。但現在我們在這心輪處得到些甚麼?我們虐待我們的小孩子。你們都坐在宇宙的心臟處,這是宇宙的心臟,你們可給整個世界一些甚麼?永恆的靈就在心臟處,此所以布萊克說:「英國要成為耶路撒冷。」因為那是心臟的所在。這即是說永恆的靈要在宇宙的注意力之中,否則事情便不能成就。但這個靈,何時才會被喚醒呢?

這個靈要在人類之中被喚醒。而那些在心臟處的人類在哪裡呢?那些住在這裡的人怎樣呢?就算是從印度來的人都是無用的,而土生土長的人都疲弱不堪,以致心臟疲弱得無法推動血液。從前是過份活躍,令世界側目,風光過後,現在到了低落時期。我們要喚醒這個心臟,去使整個世界變成靈性的存有。我們知道自己的責任嗎?我們知道作為一個靈性的人,我們的責任何在嗎?你們現在要擔當這個角色,但我們卻沒有,只忙於那些無意義的事情,我已在這裡十二年,我希望多留兩年,共十四年,希望到那時,耶路撒冷會露出它的端倪,你們是唯一能成就這事情的人。沒有別的人能夠做到,神選擇你們生長在這片土地,就是要你們負起這個責任。

今天的人你很難跟他們說宗教。甚麼宗教?那是包含所有宗教的宗教。我們談的是內在的宗教,內在的輪穴使我們獲得平衡,但今天的人很難跟他們說宗教,他們寧願談飲酒,談酒吧。我們也不能在報章上談宗教,卻報導那些假導師,那些邪惡的人。但成千上萬的人跟隨他們,奉獻所有錢財,變成乞丐。他們不想來到真理。為甚麼?我常問自己,為甚麼會變成這樣。任何借口都沒用,有這樣一個人,曾告訴你們這麼多的事情。

比如關於聖靈,布萊克說:「聖靈是個真空嗎?」你試問一下人。我曾問過一位主教,聖靈是甚麼?他說:「我是個無神論者。」我跟著問:「你在做甚麼?」他說:「這是我的職業,就好像你有你的職業一樣。」聖靈是甚麼呢?布萊克說,聖靈就在你們之內,為甚麼我們不去找尋聖靈藏在哪裡?我們應該去找尋,聖經藏不下耶穌,整個宇宙也藏不下耶穌,為甚麼我們不去找尋?現在英國的人都是自以為是的,實質上疲弱不堪。我們沒有時間了,我們不要聽任何人的,要自己出去找尋。甚麼是聖靈?其實是很簡單的,聖靈便是靈量(Kundalini)。你們試分析一下,他們說有三位一體:天父、聖子與聖靈。聖靈便是母親。你們聽說過,有父親、兒子,卻沒有母親的嗎?聖靈是太初之母。很自然會得到那個結論,但人們卻不能提及聖母。

因此布萊克談及人(Albion)的女兒,因為他知道婦女受到歧視。梵文有句話說:哪裡婦女受尊崇,便是神靈的所在。這種尊崇不是叫她們穿裸露的衣服,崇尚她們的裸體。現在女性受壓逼,以至他們不想將神視為女性,所以他們說聖靈是隻白鴿。為甚麼我們要崇拜那白鴿?沒有人解釋,那是一個謎。現今世界有許多這樣的謎。銀行制度是個謎,錢往哪裡去了是個謎,瑞士銀行與黑手黨的關係是個謎。一切都被隱瞞起來,說這只是海外銀行。而我們不斷繼續這種虛偽的行為,不加深究。這些都是不能原諒的。對於那些狡滑奸險的人,我們怎樣寬恕?對於撒旦,我們怎樣寬恕?我們談寬恕的時候,要有所分辨。

教會老是說你們是罪人。人有思想才會犯罪,老虎吃其他動物,牠不知道甚麼是犯罪。他們老是說你是罪人,犯了這個罪,那個罪。人是上帝的聖殿。神用愛創造了他們,神創造這些蓮花般的人類是為了甚麼?把他們從摩耶幻相之中帶出來,是為了甚麼?是為了給人這樣罵的嗎?神創造這些蓮花,是為了奉獻給諸神的。用他們的香氣,去照亮整個世界。他們是神的子女。但現在的人,把人視為剝削的對象,壓逼的對象。因此布萊克說有兩類人,一類要去剝削其他人,低貶其他人。他還說現代的宗教是天堂和地獄的妥協。而那些純真的人卻要受苦,那些好人要受苦。那是現在的現實。

現在且讓我們聯合起來,獲得自覺,並成為永恆的靈。這是很容易的,因為聖靈,即靈量,就在你們之內。靈量潛藏在三角骨處,你們要把這個靈量喚醒。有些人或許會問:布萊克為甚麼沒有談到靈量?因為無論他說甚麼,有誰願意去聽呢?誰願意去了解他呢?就算今日,我也找不到誰能了解他。他所宣示的,有誰願意理會?如果他要說甚麼事情,人們便覺得他古古怪怪,他說:「我一點都不介意。對於那些白痴,我說的話當然顯得神怪。」他不知多少次用「白痴」、「蠢材」這類字眼。

在我眼中,每一個人都是神的子女,但我知道布萊克為甚麼這樣憤怒。我很了解他。他要在霎哈嘉瑜伽來臨以前,對世人作當頭棒喝。但當時人對他的評論是:他不能被接受,他是發瘋的。今天我要被世人接受,我能為你們做到一切,照顧你們,給你們煮食,所有一個母親能為孩子做的,我都給你們做到。但如果事情不能成就,母親有時也要責罵孩子。母親有時要將事情說得很明白,那是為了孩子的好處。但我們不能勉強別人得到自覺,問題便出在這裡。好像俄國的霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者對我說:「母親,來我們這裡,給我們國家的領導人得到自覺。」我不能夠這樣做,他們要成為自由的人。

但當人有自由時,便不去珍惜。以至沒有人是自由的,上街時我要除去那些首飾,要麼不帶銀包,要麼把它藏好,否則會被人打劫,沒有一樣東西是安全的。因此這種自由只是帶來暴力,帶來屠殺。我們不能善待我們的子女,不能善待其他人。這些都是所謂自由所帶來的,這其實不是真的自由。我們要拋棄內在那個殘酷的自我,否則無論到哪裡去,走到右邊或左邊,始終是個問題。自由是要有智慧和尊重來配合的,如果不能做到尊重他人的自由,便不能真正享受自己的自由。因此要尊重人類的自由,要尊重這個自由,才能得到自覺,才能進入更高的自由。即布萊克所描繪過的自由。

這個國家有許多求道者,但有許多都迷失了。有些吸毒的人,來到霎哈嘉瑜伽以後,一夜之間放棄了吸毒的習慣。為甚麼能夠做到呢?因為神在你們之內早已創造了一個系統,當靈性之光照亮你們後,你們便變得很有力量。在此之前,如果叫你不要這樣做,不要那樣做,你是不能做到的,因為你沒有永恆的靈給你的力量。在耶穌以前來到世上的大部分神祇,都不明白,如果不給人得到自覺,他們便沒有永恆的靈給予的力量。耶穌明白這一點,所以祂說他們要得到重生,而且祂說你們要寬恕。耶穌知道要使他們得到平安,提昇他們的靈量,讓他們得到自覺,然後那人才變得有力量,並勝過試探。你們可以試探耶穌嗎?當然不可以。同樣,你們可以勝過試探,在自己的力量及光榮中昇進。

霎哈嘉瑜伽在十二年前,我來到倫敦的時候同時來到。我不是來移民,我來是由於偶然的機會,或者說是上天的安排。我丈夫在三十四個國家之中被選在此出任工作,而且四次一致通過他連任下去,因此我們才會來到這個國家,否則我不會來英國教授霎哈嘉瑜伽。由於布萊克,我們要努力傳揚,把英國變成耶路撒冷,無論遭遇多麼的挫敗和失望,也是不要緊的。我們要完成這個使命,布萊克有這個信心,英國有一天會變成耶路撒冷。

但首先今天在座的每一個人都先要獲得自覺,而且在你們的自覺面前謙卑下來,不要狂妄自大。布萊克說:「耶穌不會在人類面前謙卑下來,但在神面前,卻會謙卑下來。」同樣,你們要在你們的靈、你們的自覺面前謙卑下來,並且要達到那最高的境界。令人驚奇的是,在印度,我們一早已具備這個知識,但他們只是把印度人視為奴隸,沒有興趣知道這根源的知識。至於那些知識分子,他們只顧甚麼牛津劍橋的傳統。對於這些人,根本無法說明那根源的知識。這個知識不僅是為了印度,不僅是為了某個國家,而是為了整個世界。就像你們的科學知識,也是為了全世界,傳到東方來,人們都接受。同樣,接受這從東方而來的,有益於你們的知識,對你們有甚麼損害?是否只是由於這知識從東方來,你們便覺得不安嗎?耶穌基督是從哪裡來的?是從美國來的嗎?

在西方人中,無可否認,英國人是最成熟的,但我們卻跟隨那些美國人、法國人。我們知道自己是甚麼嗎?我們是智慧。我們是代表宇宙心臟的人,從布萊克的時代到今天,我希望你們已經成熟起來,知道要有一個突破。

還記得他們最初印製宣傳單張時,把我的臉孔印得很黑。我說:「那是不成的,沒有人會來參加靜坐。」人們會說:「看,有個從非洲來的人,要教我們耶路撒冷。」因此我們要重印那些單張,使我看起來不是那樣黑。皮膚的顏色有甚麼重要?真正的顏色來自你們的心,那種美麗來自你們的心。真理的美麗處在能起作用。且讓我們把它實現出來,那是很簡單的,但不要走向知識分子的道路,用有限的大腦來了解,我們要走向那無限,那便是你們的靈。那會讓我們得到集體意識,得到知識。知識的意思不是指你們大腦所學到的,而是你們通過中樞神經系統所感應到的,你們可以在指掌上感應到你們的能量中心。

我已說過很多遍,到了復活之日,連你們的手都會說話。你們看這些回教徒,很少談復活之日。但古蘭經所講的,大都有關復活之日。他們老是談末世,使人害怕,便奉獻錢財。他們說捐了錢的人,末日來時,便會得救。每一個宗教都是如此,用來賺錢,干預政治。我真不明白為何鑽石會掉進這些污泥之中,香氣變成骯髒,這是我不可能明白的。人的力量有時還超越神,他們能夠將真理變成愚蠢和無意義的事情。而且他們能夠與之共存。你去問他們,他們會說:「有甚麼不對?」這是對整個創造多麼大的浪費。人是在何等的冀望下被創造出來的。我們要做些甚麼,才能讓他們明白自己是誰?明白上天對他們的期望。有時,我也在荒野裡哭泣,我也深切感受到詩人的痛苦。他們來到世上,不斷的受苦,不斷的受苦。

今天我希望你們明白,藉著誠懇,你們才能明白自己。沒有任何書籍,沒有任何社會教化,可以說服你們,只有那誠懇的心,那對永恆的靈的渴求。這都是內在於你們的。而那種誠懇,我稱之為純潔的欲望。如果你們有這種純潔的欲望,即你們靈量的力量,你們便可即時獲得自覺。你們只要有純潔的欲望,便能做到,毋須別的。

當靈量昇起來以後,你們便要照顧你們的自覺,這樣才能不斷生長。我沒有給你們詳細說明霎哈嘉瑜伽,那是太多了。布萊克和其他許多詩人都希望成就這個工作。但現在有些新派詩人,他們討好傳媒,為了賺錢,愚弄我們。他們只會用花言巧語,引導人們落入地獄。要小心他們,你們要將子子孫孫從他們手中救出來。要拯救整個社會,要拯救整個英國,因為如果心臟死去,整個宇宙也會死亡。

願神祝福你們。

The Sahaja Yogis didn't want Me to allow you to ask Me questions, but I think better ask Me some questions.Q.....about the chakras....

Shri Mataji: Yes sir. That's what I said, that I didn't talk about them because it would be too long a lecture but we have got a book on this, a little book and there it is all written though I say that before realization don't even read that book, can create problems. You can know all about the subtle side, the chakras and everything without paying anything, without any effort. There are people now in England, you will be surprised, so many of them are excellent Sahaja yogis who are experts and they will tell you all about it very clearly. We have got books to explain. As you see there are seven chakras are shown here. The lowermost is the Mooladhara Chakra, is the innocence.

Q:...can you see it with your eyes, outside the body, can you see it?Shri Mataji: If you see something then you are not that. And people have seen it because they were not that, because they moved on the sides, on the sympathetic nervous system, what we call the Ida and Pingala. When you go on sympathetic nervous system you can see it from outside. Like this building you can see it from outside, but when you are in it you don't see it, you see only the inside. So that's what it is, when you ascend, you need not see anything, you become, you get the powers. People have seen it no doubt, but that one should not ask for. I can see the glass - better to drink the water. Now what else?

Q:....what do You do with all Your wealth, all your money?Shri Mataji: My money? Are you from the bank? What I do with My money - what do you want Me to do? What sort of a question is this? Ask a simple straightforward question madam I don't understand what do I do with My money, I don't do anything with it. Actually My husband manages his money, I ask him whatever I like. Of course he earns a lot no doubt, he earns very much. I sometimes tell him, "I'm ashamed the way they give you money," because he doesn't even pay any tax you know. Of course I do spend some money on Sahaja Yoga, I must confess I have to sometimes, what to do? One has to and these people have their own ashrams, where they stay, and look after it. For this hall they must have collected some money I don't know, I don't know what do they do with their money, I don't know, I have no idea, I've never seen that. They are honest people, they all know all about it. I don't know anything, I have nothing to do with it. This is the aggressiveness, "What do I do with My money" Just look at this. Yes sir?

Q....a man has mental illness, he wants to know whether he'll have it after he dies....Shri Mataji: No, no, no, just now you can cure it. Why to think of death? You can be cured of your mental illness at least, minimum, that could be done.

Q....How can you tell that it's Self-realization? You feel a breeze but how does it become...Shri Mataji: You see, when you feel the cool breeze is the beginning of it, all right? Now you have to see what this cool breeze is, all right? Now if you go to a college of science or a college of medicine what you have to do is to see what it is, isn't it; and to see whatever it says does it prove. Now, when you see the cool breeze in your hand, what happens that it is, as I said, is the compassion of God say for example, you just believe in the hypothesis just now. Now what is this compassion doing, is made you a computer. On the fingertips you can tell what centers are catching, of yours and of others, so you become the diagnosis. Now if you know a little few gestures by which you can handle this power, you can cure them. That's the minimum, all right? You can know from this whether you have mental problem or you have emotional problem, or you have physical problem and of what nature. This is how is the self-knowledge starts, from the very basics.

What's your problem with you, first let us see the problem on the centers, all right? Then you move forward when you go with it, then you understand what's the problem with others; then what's the problem in the collective; then what's the problem of this country; and if you know how to solve them, sitting down here, you can do it, you can solve it. But this is the breeze which has to be felt first because this is the breeze which we call as the all-pervading power of God. Now, just because I say you should not believe Me, because blind faith is of no use, but you can experiment and see for yourself. Even little children know. They can tell you what is catching in you, what chakras are catching. You can have ten children, ‘fold' their eyes, put them before a gentleman, immediately they'll raise this finger or this finger. Supposing they raise this finger, means this person feels terribly guilty. He must be a Catholic that he feels so guilty. That the children won't say but you will know that this is the chakra is caught up here because he's feeling guilty.

Like that you can go on finding on your own being like a laboratory the whole thing becomes like a computer because it is knowledge, knowledge through your central nervous system, through your evolutionary process. But you have to practice and understand what it is. If I give you a car, how will you know it moves unless and until you get into it and know how to drive it, isn't it. You have to give some time, not much, but you enjoy, best part of it you enjoy doing the whole thing. It just flows automatically, you don't have to do anything about it.

But one has to learn, little bit, what it is. Before realization you don't have to do anything, it just forms spontaneously as the seed is sown in the Mother Earth, all right? Then when it comes out, then you have to look after it; the same way you have to look after your realization, respect it. Then you become the masters. We have one master standing here and we have so many. They are just like you to look at, but they know so much and they are so humble. They don't go about with a big plate on their heads "I am the master of this and master of that" nothing. They are doing all their jobs, they are doing very well, they are blessed and also they are helping people to get their realization. You'll be surprised in Sahaja Yoga very difficult to get an unemployed person. All of them are employed. If they are unemployed they get employment with God also. Basically they are employed by God. All right?

Q... is this the only way to get realization?Shri Mataji: Yes, of course; there cannot be another, God could not make thousand and one, could He? That would be too much of a headache , like as you sprout the seed, how do you do it? Spontaneously. Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous, living process is always spontaneous. Now supposing we want to sprout a seed and we take out the primule, push it out and push it inside the Mother Earth, will it sprout - no. You have to take advantage of the powers of the Mother Earth, to sprout a seed, isn't it?

Q. ...saying she has not come across Sahaja Yoga in the religions, that there are many religions.Shri Mataji: In the religions there's no ... religions are no religions, that's the trouble is. I have told you all this just now that there is nothing, they will never mention that is sensible, but it's not so. I would say Sikhism, we can say is the latest religion. I mean there are so many verses about, much later than Islam, Sikhism came on this earth and they have said that, complete description, I mean you don't understand Hindi otherwise I would have told you - Ida, Pingala, Sushumna - everything they have described - Kabira has described at such length that we have in India a great poet Gyaneshwara and He has described all about kundalini. If you go in Maharashtra and tell them that somebody is going to awaken the kundalini, they'll all rush, they know all about it.

How many years did Christ live? How many times He could talk to people? How many of them accepted Him and how many of them understood Him? He went to a wrong place, I tell you; all were deaf, dumb and brainless. How will they understand? How could He talk about Kundalini when everybody was after His life? But He did talk of Holy Ghost, He talked of the Comforter He was going to send. He talked of so many things in that short time. Do you know for four years I was struggling with seven hippies in London; for four years. I must say, it's very creditable for Him in three and a half years to talk so much. How many years Blake had to work hard to talk to you? Is it easy to talk to people about truth? Very difficult; everybody is extremely intelligent and wise, nobody want to listen to anything, do they? But in India we have a tradition; we know it; that you have to ascend. The whole thing works out that way. If they talk of kundalini, not in the North so much, but in Maharashtra, if you go, if you go in the South, you'll be amazed six thousand people, seven thousand people come in a village. They have seen it, these people have seen it, they come in bullock carts, they come in, any way that is possible for them, buses, and trains, and they walk miles together when they hear I'm there.

Once I was coming from a program in the night and suddenly I found lots of people lying on the road. I said, "Who are these people?" They said, "Mother we couldn't reach Your program, we were late, You give us realization here." I said: "All right, have it." They had it, they are the ones who'll get much faster than anyone else, I know, that's why I don't mind spending some time here. Once I go there, you will see the whole country would be ablaze, I'm not telling you lies, you ask the people who have been there. They are very different type of people, to them most important is their spirit. If you tell them what, the way we talk about Christ here, so disrespectfully, without understanding, they are shocked. Any Indian who is a Christian or a Muslim or a Hindu, doesn't treat the way you treat Bible. The respect they have has come to them traditionally. Of course you don't judge Indians by the Indians who have come here. They like your company, they are this type, they are materialistic, they want to have money, they have come here to earn money, but the people who are in India in the villages, not in the cities, are still seeking, seeking God, they're very simple people, humble people.

Traditionally we have known for thousands of years. I talk of Markandeya who was there twelve thousand years back, who incarnated here as William Blake. Twelve thousand years back He said the same thing which is said in England after twelve thousand years, because that time I don't know what was here, may be only jungles, I think. And that is also waste, isn't it, tell Me, isn't it? How much could Christ talk about kundalini? He talked of Holy Ghost. But why stick on to that, now I have come to talk to you. Better take your realization; when He came, they talked of Moses, when Moses came they talked of Abraham. What about the present, I am with you, why not have your realization? All religions were built for this day, that you get your realization, to give you the balance, to give you that property by which you ascend. Like when we have an aeroplane, we fix it up properly; in the same way they wanted to fix you up, but the religions went astray, they made people crooked, the things they fixed, wrong bolts into wrong places, the whole aeroplane is in a tattered condition if it flies, it will all fall down. Better give up all those ideas. But kundalini is such a great force, it's such a great force; it comforts you, it cures you, it builds up all your centers and slowly moves upward and when if you get realization, also it goes back, attends to all these problems that you have. It's such a mother she is. Any other question, please?

Q. Why are you to be known as Mataji, Mother?Shri Mataji: I didn't follow.Yogi: Nor did I. Why are You to be known as Mataji?Shri Mataji: As Shri Mataji? That's the title they gave Me, what can I do? In India. You have to be an Indian to understand that. There are certain things described, about Shri Mataji. If you have read any books, of Adi Shankaracharya, or of Markandeya Himself, then you will know and the qualities described there of such a person, if they find it in someone, they call that person by that name, isn't it? Like Gandhiji was called as Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma means a bigger spirit than others, because he had that. He didn't care for himself or his own family, everything for his own, but he thought of the whole country; that's why he was called Mahatma. Now, but I didn't call Myself; if others want to call I think is all right, I have no objection. You can call anything, whatever you see, you can call that. By calling that, what is your objection? Can I ask you this question? Beg pardon? [No objection] No objection. All right, that's all right. See, then it's all right, if you understand that it is must be some reason also.(Further question from same person)

Q. Do you have some divine power?Shri Mataji: That you better find out; I am not going to be tactless on that. Christ said what was the truth, that He was the Son of God, all right, but they crucified Him. I don't want to get crucified so soon.

[INAUDIBLE Q:] But the one who is an Indian, who is an Indian and Englishman. [Hindi]. You see it is for an ... Indians understand it better. [Hindi]I'm sorry I'm speaking in Hindi because I have to little bit chastise the Indians here, I hope you don't mind. [Hindi]

Now, what is another question please? Yes please?

Q. Yogi: Mother, she is asking if you can cure physical ailment, I mean the answer's yes, that comes from Self-realization, no question.Shri Mataji with your permission, the majority of people have come for the experience and are anxious to have, I may be mistaken, but I think most people would like to stop questions and ...

Shri Mataji: But sometimes you know those who want to ask, let them ask, otherwise the brain will again put out a question. Now madam, what is it..?

(SY. She's asking You, Mother, what life was like for You as a child)?Shri Mataji: As a child? I mean that's another story; you come and see Me, I'll tell you all about it. Why do you want to know about My past and future? Let us at the present time to get your realization; makes no difference what I was as a child, or what I was as an old woman.

Yogi: ... She's asking whether you have an opinion about the growth of interest in spirituality in England...Shri Mataji: What spirituality?Yogi asks questioner: spiritualism or spirituality? Questioner answers: spiritualism.Shri Mataji: That's the witchcraft, revived; very, very dangerous. Ah, is very dangerous, never go near that, all this parapsychology and all those things. We have described all these things in our book; you can have a look at it. Is a very comprehensive thing, Sahaja Yoga is. Is the witchcraft, you may call it spirituality, because a spirit can be also a dead soul as I told you, in English language. There is no ‘ism' about God. It's infinite. ‘Isms' are all finite things.

Q. SY: she's praising Your lecture, Mother, and saying now that....she'll go back to read Blake again.Shri Mataji: I'm very happy, I'm very happy that you say that, madam, it's really such a great poet, but you'll be surprised in India, none of them brought Blake. We never read Blake there, never; you see we studied English language, we studied Shakespeare, we studied so many things, but never they mentioned Blake, you know. I don't know why. In the whole education system of India, they never mentioned Blake.

[another inaudible question ...]

Shri Mataji: That's very nice, such books you must read. Such books you must read.[Here someone disclaims in Sanskrit]You see there's a Sanskrit scholar here, but the greatest Guru is the Mother, don't you think so? The Mother is the Guru of the gurus. But it's very difficult, because guru is a hard stuff, you see. A mother has to be very soft, kind, gentle to manage the show, but the guru can be very hard and they are very hard people, but Mother as a guru is a difficult task, it's very enjoyable.

Now I have given at least eleven lectures on Guru tattwa, all right? So you can take tapes from them, you can read it and you will enjoy it very well. Here the Guru tattwa is expressed in the Void, there, where the ten Gurus actually incarnated basically and they reincarnated. Say we can start from Adi Nath, then we can come to other ones like Nanaka, Janaka. Janaka was much earlier, then we can say Abraham, Moses. All these were Guru tattwa, Socrates, all these were Guru tattwa people, the people who came as Prophets; the ones who came on this earth to teach us balance, to teach us the code of life. That was also important part, but that was forgot. Why? Why the code, why the religion? Religion is for the ascent, to build you up.

Q. ?TattwaShri Mataji: Tattwam assi, that's what is the tattwa there; tattwa is there; tattwa is nothing but your kundalini is your tattwa, is the principle....

Q: [INAUDIBLE] Parvati, Shiva; She's also called as Kundalini.Shri Mataji: Of course. Yes, yes, it is all over, same thing. I'm just giving you the gist of it.

SY: She's asking, Mother, who was Mother Durga, she's asking about who was Mother Durga?Shri Mataji: A very direct question; I told you, I'm very tactful, I'm not going to confess anything. You better find out, it's better to find out. It's nice, isn't it? To find out yourself.

Yogi: ...I'll explain, Mother, the program is that tonight will be the experience of realization and we have another program on Saturday evening, here in the same place, which will be for this knowledge part; after realization, the knowledge makes more sense, so it's better to get the experience...Shri Mataji: But our experience is very funny, I must tell you that for My program, even if there may be one thousand people, for getting realization, after that they just get lost, never grow. That's only more in England, they just don't ... they'll get lost, I think they must be going to the pub after that. I can't explain why it happens but they just get lost, they don't want to know anything anymore. I don't know why, I cannot explain, I mean, is something I cannot explain. All right, let's have it now.

So now, if we are all settled down, it's very simple, Sahaj also means simple, Sahaj; saha means ‘with' ja means ‘born'; is born with you, this right to get this union, this yoga, is born with you, is within you and is the living process of the living God so it is spontaneous. Everything that is living is spontaneous and should happen to all of you, no doubt about it. You don't have to do anything as I said but you have to receive the power within yourself, to invite the kundalini to rise. Now first thing I have to request, I hope it is not too much of it, that we have to take out our shoes to touch the Mother Earth. Is very important because the Mother Earth is the one which sucks in, for a while. I don't know, is there a carpet there? Be in a mood of reception, and also of well-being, in a happy mood, because this is the greatest moment of our lives.

Now as I said that these fingers, here five, six and seven, on the same way this way, represent the two sides of the chakras within us, the sympathetic sides, so we have to put our hands like this, just like this, simple as that. And sit, not crossed legged but putting both the feet with respect, towards the Mother Earth, in parallel to each other. Now maybe some of you must have started feeling the cool breeze, I don't know, might have, because today's lecture was rather too terrific and William Blake must have worked it out I'm sure. But otherwise is very simple. Now we have to do is to ourselves awaken our own kundalini, which is very simple, which I will tell you. In the heart resides the spirit so first we'll have to put our hand to our heart. I will tell you one by one. And then in the upper part of your stomach where the guru tattwa is here, the principle of guru is there. Then in the lower part of the abdomen, where it is the divine, or we can say the pure knowledge that exists and which works. This is the center through which the pure knowledge, the pure technique, works. Then we take this hand again back, same way, up to this point where, it is here, when we are guilty we catch this chakra. Now here works our self-confidence, our faith in God that He forgives us. Then we put our hand on top of our head - this is the Agnya Chakra, which is very important. Here we forgive everyone; then at the back of the Agnya Chakra again, where we have to say that, "If we done any mistake, oh God forgive us". These are the two sides of the Agnya Chakra. And then you put your hand, stretch it, put this part on the fontanel bone area, the soft bone which was on top of our head and press it hard and move it hard, for a while. That's all one has to do. I'll tell you one by one.

First and foremost thing is, we have to close our eyes, because eyes take out our attention; but attention will be sucked inside our body in the sense it will go through the - just like this cloth - it is spread out, but as kundalini rises, She sucks it in and then pierces through this attention, enlight[en]ing all of that. It's a happening that takes place without any trouble whatsoever. As a result of that, what you get is the cool breeze coming out of your head; you can also feel the cool breeze in your fingertips; then later on in your hands and you get that shine on your skin. Christ has said, "The face that does not shine cannot become the star." And then you get that glint of shine of the spirit in your eyes. That's all, is not the point, is much, much, much, much more but just a wee bit that we have to today testify and later on to find out have we got realization all right, then can we work it out, can we do this, because later on we have to play our role now as a spiritual being, that's the point one has to understand.

So now, have respect for yourself first of all; and not to feel guilty at all. You are the temple of God, really believe Me you are made that way, only the light is to be kindled and that is in your heart. When the kundalini rises, she's something like an energy that does that because when she pierces through, this is the place where the God Almighty resides, who is reflected in our heart as the spirit and the all-pervading power, which is the Primordial Mother, the Holy Ghost, this vibrations that you feel, the power of God, the love of God which is represented within us as the kundalini, rises and unites us, our attention to the Divine. The spirit enlightens the attention and by that enlightenment you know, on your fingertips, on your central nervous system, through your new collective consciousness about yourself and about others. Through Sahaja Yoga you know how to cure, improve, and through this happening, through the spirit you enjoy because spirit - the nature of spirit is satchidanand, means it is the truth, it becomes the attention and it is the source of joy. Without getting realization you can be happy and unhappy but you cannot be joy, which has no dualism. You become the source of joy. Such a person, when he meets someone; he sees someone, he looks at someone, just a kataksh is sufficient to raise the kundalini - just a glance is sufficient to cure that person; just a thought, can give comfort to the other person. Miracles after miracles, so many miracles that as Sahaja yogis say, "miracle' has lost its meaning Mother, in Sahaja Yoga," that's true. So miracles of miracles and every moment you feel that God is looking after you.

When this great volcano burst, exploded in Mexico, a miracle happened they say, that the children were saved. The wrath - no this was not in Mexico but later on more in Colombia, because Colombia is sending all kinds of these horrible things all over the world, making money out of it. The wrath of the Mother Earth poured that mud and the people were drowned but the children survived. Their heads were above the mud, the body inside the mud. The same Mother Earth looked after them because they should not be burned so She covered them with the mud, why? Because of the innocence in them. Those who have even the slightest innocence in them will become realized souls, no doubt about it - slightest, a very wee bit. All the seekers are a special category of people and they have to become realized souls.

So forget about the past, forget whatever you have done in your seeking, whatever you are told, whatever you are branded with, just forget it and forgive yourself, once for all. This is I am telling you this because this is one of the biggest problems of the West that everybody sits down with a bad, horrible trouble here and sometimes I feel it so much that I can't even hear people. Is terrible. This portion is so bad here so I have to request you that please forgive yourself. You are the glory of God, without you God has no meaning also. It is He who is anxious, much more then you are, to give you realization. Just help Him out a little.

All right. Let us see. So we put our both the hands like this, close our eyes. Now you have to keep the left hand all the time towards Me, because is the desire, is expressed through it is the power of desire in the left hand which expresses that you want to have realization. The right hand is the power of action so you move your right hand but don't open your eyes. You have to keep your eyes all the time shut, just the opposite of mesmerism as you can see. Now please close your eyes; now put your right hand on your heart.

Now here you have to say, or ask Me a question, "Mother am I the spirit?" You may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever suits you. "Mother am I the spirit?" is a fundamental question and if you are a computer it will answer. "Mother am I the spirit?" Ask the question three times please. Put your left hand properly, please close your eyes; everybody should do it, please. It's uncivil not to close your eyes; please close your eyes because others may feel self-conscious so please close your eyes, to be courteous.

Now you have to take down your right hand on the upper part of your stomach, on the left hand side, we are working only on the left hand side. Here is the principle of the master. If you are the spirit, automatically you have to ask the second question, "Mother am I my own master? Mother am I my own guru?" Please ask this question, you have to ask this question three times again, without fear, with all confidence you ask this question, you are the spirit, you are your master.

Now move your right hand on the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side, lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of the divine work, of the divine knowledge or the pure knowledge, of the technique of divine manifestation. At this point I cannot force you to do anything, as I told you, you have to be free, I can only request you and here I say that you have to ask for the divine knowledge, you have to ask for the pure knowledge and when you ask for it the kundalini will start moving. Here with sincere heart, in a humble way you have to say, "Mother may I have the pure knowledge, Mother may I have the divine technique?" Ask this question six times because this center has got six petals.

Now to make the way easy for kundalini, we go along the same centers upwards so you put your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen, to make it easy for the kundalini to rise you have to open this center by asserting, by saying "Mother I am my own master", by saying "Mother I am my own master", ten times because there are ten petals, ten Sat gurus basically who incarnate ten times, of Prophets, the Masters.

Now raise your right hand on your heart, press it. With the same confidence you have to say twelve times "Mother I am the spirit, I am the spirit, I am the spirit". Just assert, that's a fact, that's the truth. Press it with your fingers. Now, twelve times, have full confidence in you, believe Me you are the spirit, you have to just become in the sense it has to come in your attention on to your central nervous system.

Now raise the right hand on the left hand side of your neck, in the corner where the neck and the shoulder meet, press it hard, take it backwards, press it hard. This is the most difficult center in the West, as I told you, that we feel guilty all the time but as I have told you, God is the ocean of love, ocean of compassion, but above all He is the ocean of forgiveness. He's the ocean of forgiveness. When He's the ocean of forgiveness, what guilt can we have that He cannot wash away or dissolve it? So just you have to say sixteen times because there are sixteen petals, to say sixteen times with full belief in yourself, "Mother I'm not guilty, Mother, I'm not guilty, Mother, I'm not guilty" sixteen times will you please say that "Shri Mataji I'm not guilty". If you still feel you are guilty and you can't forgive yourself, better say it to punish yourself hundred and eight times, if that pleases you.

When you forgive yourself you have to forgive others and so the greatest message of Christ, that we have to forgive others you have to put your hand to the center which is the adornment or we should say which adorns Christ, on the Agnya Chakra on your forehead, please put your right hand across,. Press it hard and here you have to say with full belief in yourself and in your powers that, "Shri Mataji I forgive everyone". Some may say that's very difficult but what do we do when we forgive or not forgive - no logic in it. But when we say that, then we are out of the clutches of other people, so please say, "Shri Mataji I forgive everyone. Now say it with your whole heart, how many times is not the point, please say it with your whole heart. Now you move your hand backwards onto the back side of the same center - Agnya - press it hard. Now here, you have to say once only without feeling guilty at all, without feeling no remorse, no condemnation, to God, one for your satisfaction, "Oh Lord, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me" but don't feel guilty, that's very important. Even without saying He has forgiven you. Better.

Now raise your right hand on top of your head, stretch your ... stretch your palm, press it hard on the fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone in your childhood, press it hard, move it seven times. Again here I cannot force anything on you. You have to say that you want your Self-realization that, "Mother, please give us our realization. We want our Self-realization. Please give me my Self-realization" and press it hard and move it seven times and say that. I'm sure it will work out.

Now bring down your hand, slowly, and bend your head a little bit and feel with your left hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Try to bend your head a little, little bit and about four inches above the head, bend it a little, that works out better sometimes. With your left hand, right hand towards Me and with the left hand you see the breeze. Right hand towards Me and then with the left hand you see, you can feel it better, with the left hand on top of your head; first with the left hand. Aah. Now put the left hand towards Me and with the right hand just see if it is blowing because it should come in both the hands. Open your eyes, open slowly and watch Me without thinking. Let us see if you can do it - just without thinking, just watch Me, without thinking. There's no thought in your mind, no thought. Now just put your hands like this, are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

Now put your hands up in the air, like this, and in your heart ask a question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Ask the question, put it up nicely, ask the question three times: "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the brahma shakti? Is this the all-pervading power of God? Ask the question. Now put down your hands and see for yourself if you feel the cool breeze. All those who have felt the cool breeze on the head, coming out of the head, or on their fingertips or in the hands please raise your hands, both the hands. That's Blake. You all have become Blake. May God bless you.

So many. May God bless you. But I must warn you, after this don't talk about it because it is beyond reasoning. Secondly you must come back, must all of you come back and work it out. Those who haven't got realization will also receive it. Those who have got it, will establish it. Please come back. You will enjoy the silence, the stillness within. But that's just the beginning of it. We have to go further. Otherwise you won't be able to manifest it properly. It has to be looked after. It's just a shoot that has come out, a little shoot we have to look after it. May God bless you all. Thank-you very much. Why not sing Jerusalem to them ... will be good idea.

Yogi: Mother with Your permission the music group would like to sing one song for You but before that we have a little memento of this evening which we would like to present.Shri Mataji: You want to sing, all right? You have all the arrangements here. All right. If you don't mind, just sit down for five minutes.

Yogi: So Garuda take wing.While we were preparing the program of Blake's Birthday Festival Mother, we found out there was an Exhibition of Blake's work in London in one of the galleries and we very much wanted to give You something that was made by His own Hands and with the good wishes of all the Sahaja yogis of England we've been able to do it for You.Shri Mataji: Oh that's too much, that's too much Gavin, that's too much.

Yogi: No it's something special Mother, we hope that it'll be our pledge to try to do some justice to You as You've tried to do some justice to Blake.Shri Mataji: I'm so proud of Him, really. Can you - I am not good at opening. Done so well. Ohh. What a beautiful one. Trigunatmika. Do you see the trigunatmika is there? What a vision. I mean how can you understand Him without Sahaja Yoga ... picture, you cannot ... May God bless you. Thank-you very much

Yogi: This is the engraving of the Daughters of Job from the illustrations to Book of Job.Shri Mataji: What is?Yogi: Daughters of Job.Shri Mataji: Trigunatmika. Three Powers - the Comforter, and the Counselor and the Redeemer, three Powers, which you will know, later on. We have those three Powers within ourselves. Go ahead.

Yogi: [INAUDIBLE]Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.[The mike is not all right. Loudly.]Song: ‘Seek and You Will Find'.

Song: ‘Jerusalem.' Yogi: We'd like everyone to stand up to sing Jerusalem.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you all and bless this country. God bless you.
