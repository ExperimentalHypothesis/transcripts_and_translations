H.H.Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi being interviewed on 2JJJ FM Radio (ABC Radio). Sydney, Australia. (1983-0315)

Interviewer:...is 12 and now here’is Tony Walker on the leadership trials on Mid-south [?]. If you think there’s no room left in the world for any more gurus, I’d say you are wrong, there’s one in town at the moment, She’s not exactly new, having been a friend of the Mahatma Gandhi’s, She’s nonetheless nowhere near as high profiled as one of the shri rajnesh or the maharishi, or the guru maharaji. She’s in fact Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, and I translate literally as “The Immaculate Goddess”, She claims to be the only link between the Creator God Almighty and mankind, and like many of the others of the kind She doesn’t take money from Her followers, which causes some people to view Her with some suspicion. She sais that She’s by the perfect capitalist and the complete communist, both at one time. Many miracles have been attributed to Her, including healing the death and the cancer sufferers. She claims that the orthodox western Christian churches have lost their direction. I spoke to Her yesterday.

Shri Mataji: The message is for all the seekers, those who are seeking beyond, what is available to them now, that we are the Spirit, we are seeking our Spirit. And that can happen to us, because it’s all built in within us to be the Spirit. The whole thing is built in within us during the process of our evolution. And this evolution has brought you to a point now, at the human level, where you have to jump slightly more, to become the Spirit.

Interviewer: Can you explain what you mean by the Spirit?

Shri Mataji: The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within us. And we are the reflectors. When we become human beings, the reflection becomes more complete.

Interviewer: Why there it was that you were born with this awareness?

Shri Mataji: I better ask God about that. [Shri Mataji loughs].

Interviewer: What’s the [Inaudible - mains you communicate this knowledge You gave to other people]

Shri Mataji: First I bring them to logical conclusion by their mental understanding, to tell them about what is their aim in life, why they’ve been created on this earth, why they are here. And what to expect when Self Realisation takes place. Is not that you pay money for it and think that you are a member of some organization. And the whole organization as if accepted by God, sanctified by God. And then first talk to them about it, logically bring to a proper conclusion about what we should expect truthfully understand and honestly then accept the thing that you have to be the Spirit yourself and you have to be the guru yourself. Then, by the way that you have already within yourself, the built in process of this happening, of the second birth. I just, like an enlightened light can enlighten another light. I just can do it.

Interviewer: I’ve read that you claim to be the only person with the case of arriving at the Self Realization. Why do you think you are the only person?

Shri Mataji: Because I haven’t met anybody else, but I don’t claim that I’m the only person. I never claim anything, why should I claim ? But these people say so because they haven’t found anybody else who can do en masse, this is a en masse happening, which nobody is doing. If there were somebody else, I would retire, I would be very happy to do it.

Interviewer: You’ve said that the inability or incapacity or the refusal of the people to come into the self realisation  is largely to blame for the problem of how to percept the world. Can You explain in more detail exactly what You mean by that and how that takes place?

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s one of the things, but the main thing is that the time has come for us to achieve this new awareness, this is the time of resurrection, this is the time of last judgement.

Interviewer: Do you think it’s problematic if You just said that the time of judgement has [depend?] that your message is a particularly easy one to understand or they can have difficulty to [confine?] it to majority of the people on the earth?

Shri Mataji: Is what that it is, somebody has to do it. If not Me, you have to do it.

Interviewer: What I’m asking is do you think it’s problematic, a difficult message to understand?

Shri Mataji: Not at all, is the simplest, but people are not simple, see, people are very much mentally complicated. But if you are simple people, is the easiest thing to do, because is a living process, and very easy to understand a living process.

Interviewer:  Can you explain that? I’m sorry, but I’m afraid that I don’t see the point that you’re making there.

Shri Mataji: You see, any living process cannot be explained mentally, any living process like why, even in medical science, by example, why acetylcholine and adrenaline, these two chemicals act in a funny way in the body? Or, otherwise, if you see why that a seed sprouts, how the choice of seeds take place without a mango seed will give you a mango tree, sort of things you cannot explain all these things because it is a tremendous task of living process, done by the all pervading power of God.

Interviewer: That’s Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi and She’s speaking every night this week, starting tonight, at the Maccabean Hall, at 140 Darlinghurst Road, Darlinghurst, up until and including Friday night each night at 7 o’clock. It’s ten and a half ...
