First Public Program. Melbourne (Australia), 8 March 1983.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

We have to understand that God has created us as human beings with a purpose. But in those modern times when we don't even believe in God, or on a, in a creator, or any such energy that exists, it's very hard to talk of God and to introduce him to be the one who has made us human beings. But even Darwin said that if man has come so far he will have to go a little further to understand himself. I would suggest that one has to only understand one point, that whatever we have so far known, has been the knowledge of the tree but we have to have the knowledge of the roots. To get the knowledge of the roots, we have to become subtler than what we are.

This awareness, this human awareness, cannot take us that side. For example, you are all listening to me very intensely, but if I say "please take your attention inside", you'll say "how, Mother it's impossible. How do we take our attention inside?" It's only possible when something happens within you that your attention is drawn inside, then only you will come to know that you are a beautiful instrument made through ages.

All these centres that are shown here represent your evolutionary process, one by one, how you evolved through ages to this stage of evolution, and now after evolving, after the human stage, what do we have to do?

So we come to right conclusions about ourselves first of all, that we have to become something more, something has to happen to us. Now so far in our evolution whatever has happened has happened in our awareness, Sanskrit called (Chaitanya?), means a horse can go through a dirty lane, a dog can go through a dirty lane, but a human being cannot, he just can't bear it. He'll vomit, he'll refuse, he'll not accept at any cost to pass through something very filthy. So our awareness towards dirt, filth, towards beauty has definitely got a new dimension, and this new dimension that we have got is not sufficient enough because still we have not understood why are we here. Why all this has been done to create us into such a beautiful personality. What is the purpose of this creation, and in this confusion only we really fall into the traps of not understanding that there must be some power that does it.

It is very easy to deny the power of God because, who is there to challenge it, or who is going to say that, how dare you deny.

Supposing you have a policeman. He's elected by you, so you cannot overthrow him, or you have to listen to Him. But God is not elected by you, He is appointed by Himself. So as He is there you can always say whatever you like about Him. But the same thing is to understand that actually human beings don't do any work which is living.

We cannot transform one flower into a fruit, even one. What we do is to take some dead things, make buildings, make beautiful furniture, make these carpets, all man made, every sort of thing, and then we start thinking, "Oh, we are great."

Even the science can only find whatever is available or can be seen through these eyes, or felt through these senses. It cannot go beyond it, and even if it sometimes goes like the auras and all that they see, they cannot explain it. For example if, if there is any doctor, they will understand that, doctors are honest on this point, that (acitiline ? and adri-adinaline adrenalin ?), aciticoline and adrenaline, two chemicals which are chemicals, just chemicals, react differently in the body, and they say that the mode of action of these two we cannot explain why it is augmentation or why it is relaxation. They admit it. So many things we have not been able to explain. Now if I say this is a beautiful instrument, and it is fantastic to believe that we are great, I would just give another simple example that if you have to come to this room, and there is no light, I just tell you alright, push that button and you will get lights everywhere. No, it happens, it becomes a fantastic thing for a person who has never seen electricity, who has never known anything, who has no knowledge of electricity, that only you press one button and you get it!

But behind all this organism, behind all this working, all that is done, there is a big history. There are lots of people who have worked to achieve this. People have sacrificed so much to achieve this, but we are taking the benefit of that as, today we are enjoying electricity. How many people must have died discovering it. How many people must have sacrificed their life for disc.., for discovering the use of it for the masses.

In the same way we must understand that maybe that we are something fantastic, reach a conclusion that we have to just feel it. And unless and until you feel that greatness within you, you should not just deny that you can achieve it, you have to achieve it. Actually, if you do not achieve it you will fall short of your evolution.

Today in the world if you see every where I go there are so many seekers, so many seekers, such a time was never there before - say about fifty years back we did not know the word "seekers", people did not believe that there are seekers. But today you will find so many seekers all over the world, they have gone to all kinds of other alternative things, they have tried to find out if they can find truth by altering their lives by doing this or by doing that. The reason is they are not at all satisfied with what they see, they're intelligent enough to see that it's not the end of our lives and we don't live just for insurances. Now, then one starts thinking that if these are the seekers in this world, why so many have come on this earth. This is a special time already predicted thousands and thousands of years back, in every kind of prediction they have talked about you.

There was a book called Narhi Granth written, you can't say how many years back but was revised only three hundred years back by another person called Bhujander. Now this Narhi Granth, is written by a person who is actually the starting point of astrology in India, the one who started the whole astrology has been started from India, and this is the man, Brighu, who did it. And he wrote this Narhi Granth, in which he has described, according to him, he said it in Sanskrit language but was again translated and brought to up to date level, that in 1970 something will happen, a personality will come on this earth who will give realization to thousands of people by a Sahaja method, it's clearly written down you'll be amazed to know that it is so, because we have a book, in that book all these prophecies are written, and what will happen, the Kundalini will rise, and people will get their realization.

To Indians Kundalini is not a new knowledge. Of course, there are some people who went from, ah, other countries and tried to study about kundalini. Now when such people come to India they do not reach the roots at all, they are just caught up by people who want to make money out of them or to mislead them, it's a big market there for all such things. And now when these people also came, specially the Germans when they came to India they were caught up into such mess and they were given books which were nothing but just the opposite of what Kundalini is, it's about the people who are doing tantrism, and tantrism is a system in which people do anti-God activity, with anti-God activity you get all kinds of horrible experiences of God and the Kundalini, and they have described all of them as if they are the real effects of Kundalini. Is like the knowledge of a naive villager coming and putting his hand into the holes of, ah, a plug and saying that electricity gives you a big shock.

So it is even worse than that because Kundalini never gives you trouble, She is your mother. She's settled down here in the triangular bone, as you see is called as sacrum. Now this sacrum bone is, sacrum means sacred, and when I ask people that, how is it that this bone is called as sacred in Greek? When I went to Greece, I asked the people "why do you call this a sacrum?" Then they told me that they had a (report?) long time back, before Alexander went to India, and there was a (report?) between Indo-Aryan groups and they told that this bone should be called as sacrum. Now imagine that this bone specially should be called as sacrum and no other bone, so this bone has got this three and a half coil energy settled down inside there.

Now some of these books that I've read, such big books written on Kundalini, some of them say the Kundalini is here, somebody says in the nose, somebody says somewhere else. Means that just, just using the ignorance of people to print something, write something, and just mislead them to make some money out of these books. So far I've not written any book, I am sorry I've not yet done any that work so far, but anything can be written in the book. Whatever is written in the book is not the truth and you should not accept it, how much does it take to print a book?

You people are living in such an advanced country you know it hardly takes anything to write a book about anything especially about God and his work, because even you will be amazed, that Hitler used to talk about God, Napoleon used to talk about God. All these horrible people used to talk about God, and sometimes they believed that God was in their favour because they thought they were rather successful.
Now these books or whatever they have told you, is not true. This is the truth that the Kundalini lies in your sacred bone called sacrum. You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini at the time when the Kundalini is raised, not in everyone. If you have got a blockage in that another centre that is there or the opposite (upper?) centre. Then this Kundalini, because this is the pure desire of becoming one with God. This is the purest desire we, which you have, and when it is awakened it makes a effort, a tremendous effort, but I have seen some people have Kundalinis which are just hurt like a beaten up snake, you see, it just toss, it tosses itself on all the sides and tries to get out but it cannot because the gentleman, or the seeker, who has got this Kundalini within himself, his own Mother, has hurt Her so much that She cannot raise Her head, She is very tired and She wants the supply of more energy to rise.

So when people are here I have to tell you one thing that it's nice that you have come for realization, you should take it! But you can't demand it, you can't demand it. For today I found one gentleman was just shaking before me like this all the time, so he said "Why am I shaking before you?" I said "Because your nerves are out, you are a nervous person, that's why you are shaking. All your nerves are out, I have to steady them otherwise the Kundalini won't rise and you won't feel the cool breeze, because Kundalini is now attending to those nerve centres which are absolutely overdone, they are absolutely fagged out and tired." He's a young man, about twenty five years, I am an old woman, but I said "Look at my hands I'm not shaking, why should your hands shake like an old man of eighty years all the time? You must think about it, why should they think, ah, should happen." So this is what it is, that some people get it. Most of them get it but some cannot get it. Now the attitude should be little different from what you have towards anybody else. Here you have to get something out of me. You have to make use of me. Not that I have to use you for any purpose whatsoever.

It should be clear cut to you, that you are asking for something, you deserve it no doubt, it's like you go to the bank alright - there's a banker sitting there, if you have some money in the bank, you can go and talk to him but you can't be rude with the banker, you have to say alright, "I have got this money with you, please may I have?" Now the Grace of God is so gracious that it gives you many for much more than what you have really reserved in the bank, I can see that working out so well. So we have to understand that we are made in our own glory, God has made us a fantastic thing. We are a great instrument that has to receive its blessings, and as this instrument is put to the mains, once you put to your mains you will be surprised how fantastic you are. It's amazing how people are not aware of themselves. It is amazing how people do not know how precious they are to the Divine. Human beings are the epitome of this creation, forget the moon, forget the sun, forget this earth, everything is nothing, it's at your feet. You are the highest that God has created and the way we fritter away our life for nothing at all, for superficial things, is something very, very surprising, we are not at all aware that how much the nature has worked for us, to make us human beings, and once you realize that you are the spirit - realize doesn't mean that you just realize through a mental process.

It is a happening within you which takes place. You become that. And once you become that you'll be amazed that your becoming will prove that you are really the epitome, you are the meaning, you are everything and without you the creation has no meaning at all. It's like a tree which has now the flowers and they have to become the fruits, otherwise the tree has no meaning at all. But whatever we do mentally is artificial. Because it has no roots attached to it, it has no moorings to it. Now your, say, your politics or your economics, all is artificial but in that also you can find a lot of truth. For example, economics says that wants in general are not satiable. Individual wants can be satisfied. But wants in general are not satiable. Means this matter cannot give us satisfaction. If it could then we would have been satisfied with one thing, but we buy one thing then we buy, want to buy, another thing and then we want to buy another thing and still we are the most dissatisfied souls ever living on this earth.

Now economics another, then politics; we can see is that people talk of say communism, they talk of socialism, they talk of democracy, of capitalism. Is all so artificial to me, is just a play of human beings because when you say you are a capitalist, what is your capital? This you can't take with you, it is of no use, you don't want to share it, what is the use of such a capital? While I would say I am a capitalist because I have all the powers within myself and I am the greatest communist because I can't live without sharing it. I just can't help it. You see people can't understand me. They think: you are a nicely married lady, your husband is such a nice person, ah - is such a nice gentleman, he loves you so much, he cares for you so much. You are a grandmother, you are a mother, and why are you doing all this and running about everywhere talking to people? They can't understand this communism which is so important to me that I cannot get my joy without sharing it with others. Is something which people have to gradually take in and once they take in they become themselves.

It's my job that I have to give you what you have. It's your own, I do not do anything about it, is your own; all you are built in that way. Only thing what I do, like a candle which is enlightened can enlighten any other candle which is ready. But some people will escape saying, "I’m not ready." Now, you let me find out if you are ready or not. That's another side of it. "Mother you are - we are sinners, we are not ready." Now you let me do the job for you. I may be able to put the candle right. Why do you condemn yourselves? This is the other side of it. Sometimes people get into ego moods and sometimes they get into such a superego mood that they say," Mother, oh, we are no good, we are sinners, we have done this, we have done that." Now forget it.

If I don't know the job then I better not do it, but I think I know it, I have done it, so let me do it, and let us see if I can give what you have because that is supposed to be God's promise that you have to get your resurrection, that you have to become self realised, that you are to be born again, and all this has been done within you with this aim and is not to be wasted.
I don't know how many in Melbourne are going to get it, how many are going to get in Sydney, that's besides the point, it depends on how much you care for yourself. But wherever I go I will try my level best to do it. Now how I cure people and what happens; actual curing is not at all my job, its just a by-product by which you get cured completely. Because once you get your absolute and you get to the source which is all pervading which is - which starts flowing through you, then your problem is solved. You never get exhausted, you never get upset, it's all solved. The whole energy works it out. So the compassion that people talk of "that we are very compassionate, and we are very peace loving" and all that is so superficial. This is the compassion that it works. It works, it doesn't talk, it just works. This is the peace that exists, that you feel is expressed within you and without. A person of that calibre if he stays with other people who are turbulent, who are, ah, volcanic, who are violent, they become peaceful. It works, that's what it is, you must know that whatever people are saying to you, it must work.

Like going to other gurus, to other people, you should know that it has not given you any power of your own, leave alone whatever they have to say about me, I am this, I am that, I am that, forget it. What I am saying, what are you? You have to receive your own significance. You have to understand your own meaning and if it works in you then it's alright. That's what you should ask anyone if you go to and say that "can you give me my own powers, not your powers?" You may be very great and you might be doing something. But people are so ridiculously superficial, so ridiculously superficial that a person if he buys 58 Rolls Royce out of the money, of loots that they have out of these, ah, people who go to them, we think "Oh! he has 58 Rolls Royce's." He - such a man can impress these English who could not be impressed by anything else. If he has a big (cavalcade?) or a big procession or these 58, ah, looted, ah, Rolls Royce on the road, then people say "Oh! what a guru he is, he's got 58 Rolls Royce." Yes, you won't believe, and he wanted to have the 59th one and he went away to America. And he wrote a letter saying that if you give me the 59th I'll come. The poor boys you see, they suffered, they ate only potatoes, they starved themselves, they have - they are 50,000 still in the U.K., absolutely cabbages, lost people, absolutely lost. You can't talk to them, they shake when you go before them, they can't understand that it is all finished there. Nothing, they are all lost people, and if you go and tell them "How can you get a Rolls Royce for a sadhu, he's a sanyasi he says, how can you give him a Rolls Royce?" So they say "We have got the spirit", means some spirit has possessed them you see, "we have got the spirit and we have to give just metal." What's in Rolls Royce? Is metal. But why don't they think, why does the guru thinks that this metal is precious you see, we don't use our brains at all when you go to gurus, surprisingly.

If he says I will make you fly, alright at least you should ask the guru to fly. Why not make him fly and see if he can fly or not. At least minimum of minimum that he should do isn't it? But that we also never do, we just accept it. Because he has a big, ah, organisation and he has a big publicity, because you can pass through seven rooms to reach him and all that, he creates a feeling, and then you think "Oh, it's great to fly", and if somebody says that go and ask that guru to fly, people don't like it. They don't want to hear anything about it and then you pay thousands and thousands of pounds to them, you end up as penniless people, as epileptic people and you can't understand what wrong it was. You didn't use your brains. You didn't use your brains I would say, I know. I must condemn all these devilish people who have ruined so many seekers because they are seeking truth, they are my children, they're my own I know. I feel very sorry for them, you don't know how much I want to work that I should save all of them, but I also should tell you that this is your mistake, you misunderstand, you don't know that you can't pay for your realisation, you can't pay for God. Christ was bought for 30 rupees. Is a very good example to understand, he was bought to be killed. Another example is that when people were selling some things in the temple he took a big whip and whipped them absolutely in a great temper; who - who said on the cross that "Please God forgive them for they do not know what they are doing." But now it is so sad that if you do like that you won't be able to forgive yourself. Christ may be, but you may not be able to forgive yourself for doing all these mistakes and committing such horrible injuries upon yourself and troubling your Kundalini to that extent.

This self-realisation you have been seeking for ages, many lives. You have been seekers for many lives and the time has come, this great time of resurrection, the great time of your judgement. At this time you should take it, take it up that you have to be self-realised. Only, this is my message to you, I hope you will understand it. May God Bless you.
I would like you to ask me some questions because today is the first day, but ask relevant question. Some people you see just ask questions, just to show off. Then I would say they should take another hall to give a lecture there, but normally, ha ha ha, yes, yes, some people start giving another lecture to me, you see, and instead of my lecture I have to listen to their lecture which has no relevance to it. So I would request you not to waste others' time, be civil to them and ask questions which are relevant to the subject. Thank you very much.

Warren: Right, any questions? Each night Mataji is going to be speaking here.

Shri Mataji: Keep the cane on one side. (laughter)

Warren: Each night Mataji is going to be speaking here, She'll be talking tomorrow night about the centres that lie up to the heart, and the next night the centres that lie to the Sahastrara, in particular the chakra of the Sahastrara. So, any particular questions about the individual centres within us.
Shri Mataji: You can ask...

Warren: She'll be explaining on a day-by-day basis. So any questions thus far?

Q: I want to know if having a vertebrae in the spine out of place interferes with the rising of the Kundalini?

(Warren repeats question to Shri Mataji)
Shri Mataji: It does, to some extent it does, definitely it does, but we can put it right. The vertebrae can be put right and the Kundalini can be brought up. It does. So many things do happen, if you have, if you are a person over read, if you have read too many books and the books are in your head I have to empty that also.

(laughter)

Warren: I actually do this work as a profession and I find that if the subtle centre is fixed, the spinal problems just disappear. I used to have three and four adjustments a week, to correct my spine, and now I have none at all. So first fix the subtle within us and then the gross part, the spinal misalignments and so on, will just get better.

Q: Do you feel there can be a difference between marriage that people can be married on earth in a seemingly holy way but there is really a difference in the marriage itself (you know, in the getting married, so called marriage?)

Shri Mataji: I think there..

Warren: I'm not too sure, but, earthly marriages which seem to be okay – but, are you saying a mismarriage of souls? - Perhaps - but maybe there is some sort of mismarriage in some way of souls of those same people. Can there be a perfectly "normal" as we call it - earthly marriage, and perhaps a mismarriage of souls? - in a heavenly sense.

Shri Mataji: You see the spirit in every being is perfect, everybody's spirit is perfect, there's no imperfection with it but some people have a more reflection of the spirit in their character and some people don't have. They have more darkness and more we can say, outwardly or materialistic you can call them, or you can call them the over- romantic type, any sort of thing which is outside. But doesn't matter we have seen people who have been married before, they said they are maladjusted. I would say 90% such marriages are now doing well. But maybe, there could be terrible difference also between the two persons as you say is possible, but that is to be seen. Just now you should not worry about it. If there is any maladjustment, it might be put right, if it doesn't work out then you have to work out the correction as far as possible. See it is said (sanskrit) is that which we can do the work, we can work it out as far as possible but if it doesn't work forget it, that's it.

But once you are a realised soul you become so congenial, so tolerant, so understanding. Actually your being itself corrects another person. But maybe some people can be such gone cases, that whatever you may try they may not come back. So it is not important to worry about those things, we'll see later on how the thing is and how it has to be worked out, alright?

Q: Could you please explain more about the realisation process when it comes out of the top of your head.

Warren: Could you explain self - realisation, and in particular how it manifests on your hands and how it comes out of the top of your head.

Shri Mataji: It just comes out, (laughter) you see how do you explain - how does a primule of the germ of a seed comes out. It's like that. It's a living process, as I said - the Kundalini rises and when She enlightens all other centres She passes through them and then when She comes up here at this point, (Shri Mataji puts her hand on the agnya chakra) this point is very important in human beings is bestowed or, we can say that, it is governed by the deity of Lord Jesus Christ, and He sucks in these two institutions called ego and super-ego. By that there's an opening made and the Kundalini just jets out and you can feel it coming out of your head. This is the actualisation of baptism, it's not something artificial that you take water and put it on somebody's head and say that you are baptising, here the child is screaming with that baptism. So it's an actualisation, it's a living process, how it works. But while rising of course lots of things happen like, ah, the chakras go into various moods, ah, they try to sustain the Kundalini, they try to keep it there, all these things happen.

These happen when the Kundalini is awakened, not before that. That's why like somebody talks of Raja Yoga that you cut your tongue, push it back and do the (kayjari?) and by that you can raise your Kundalini and it is absurd, you see. Like the car has not started so you move the wheels and the car will start. But when the Kundalini is rising this tongue is little bit pulled inside no doubt, automatically, you don't feel it also, slightly it is pulled inside and is released again, but by cutting this tongue and putting it back do you think the Kundalini will rise? Is so superficial, it's so artificial and that's how they have done all these things. Even now, for example Hatha Yoga that we do, is - of course Hatha Yoga is (ashtanga?) is, not only one we call as yoga is standing on your head. Is not the only thing it is ashtanga? (that main thing?) and in that also (ishwariprana?) means establishment of God is the first thing. Because before the Kundalini has started if you start doing any exercises you will be harming - you may be harming yourself. Because you don't know where is the problem. Supposing you have a problem in the stomach and you are doing the exercises of the nose, what's the use? You will spoil the nose as well as the stomach is already bad. So its very indiscriminate. It's very scientific. The mantras are the same thing, where you say which mantras, what chakras are catching, which deity is to be awakened, we must know all the signs that we have and everybody knows, there is no secret about it.

There is not a thing - you come here inside and you pay, pay me 300 pounds and I give you a mantra, alright that mantra you are not to tell anybody because that mantra means nothing you see. There was a fellow who paid 300 pounds and I asked him what was the mantra and he said "tinga". Now if you tell an Indian he will just laugh if he hears, what it means, it means this. (Shri Mataji puts her thumb up)Can you imagine, such nonsense and don't tell anybody, it's a big Mafia. Don't tell anybody, just keep quiet, if you tell anybody then - because you are found out. You cannot give one mantra, is a, another, ah, funny idea people have that you just give one mantra to somebody. Of course I mean if you have a problem at a particular point one can say that at this time you say this mantra to clear out but then later on you don't go on with it. Then you do the one which ever you need, require. Isn't it? Is as simple as that. Supposing you are suffering from some trouble we take medicine for that particular thing and then when we are suffering from another trouble we take another medicine for that particular thing. We don't go on taking the same medicine whether it is anything. So it is a very scientific knowledge which you will pick up in no time. Eight days are sufficient to learn the whole of Sahaja Yoga. Once you get your realisation, that's the main point.

Q: Does meat eating interfere with all this process?

Shri Mataji: What is it?

Warren: repeats question

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, not at all, but you see, you have to understand what sort of a personality you are. If you are the right sided personality then you should not eat meat, you should take to something milder you can, you can, I call them grass eating, you can do. But if you have say, you are left sided person, then you have to take meat. You see, I would say in general that Australians should not eat so much meat as they eat, they eat meat too much. They should take more vegetables. But Indians should eat some meat because otherwise they'll become cowards. So it is what sort of a personality it is. I don't know from where this idea has come that vegetarianism is going to take to God. In India most of the people are vegetarians because they can't afford it you see.

Q: No, no, no - I don't think that our attitude here is to take to God... (rest unintelligible)

Shri Mataji: Ah, yes, but it is not important for everyone. What I'm saying, as it is we have to understand, we have to be discreet, we have to understand who needs what. Everybody need not take to vegetarian food. Every body need not take to non-vegetarian food. It's the prakruti as they call it, is the nature of the person. You must find out what is the nature of the person. If he, supposing he is suffering from high blood pressure, and other things like that he has to take to, ah, food which is, ah, which will control his, I mean which will give him a, another side. Means he should stop eating meat, some things like that. Alright, so he, he balances himself. To balance himself. The whole food is a theory, is to be understood through the understanding of your being first of all, what sort of a being you are, and what is lacking in you is to be supplemented.

So we just can't, ah, say that now so many people now, in doctors if you go to them they'll say "cut down your sugar", general. But is absurd! Sugar is very important for liver. If you don't take sugar I don't know what will happen to you, you will become like sticks, you see, absolutely like sticks. If those people who are right-sided if they don't take sugar at all I don't know what's going to happen to them. They will be very irritable, hot-tempered, absolutely stick-like people. They'll hit you like a stick, you know. So that's something, a general statement like that is very dangerous. Just not to have, but what is the science behind it? Carbohydrates are very important for the body, especially if you are thinking too much, if you are a futuristic person, if you are right sided it's absolutely essential that you must have sufficient carbohydrates. We have treated so many liver patients with sugar, so this kind of a general statement even, sorry for it, I must say that doctors should not feel hurt, but is a very general statement doctors also make. No doubt about it, without going into it to find it. It's very easy to say "now you all should stop sugars." Why? Our forefathers ate sugars, they were healthier people than us, I tell you. All of us are sick now, this way or that (...?). If physically you are alright, mentally we are out. If we are mentally out, then we think that physically we are alright. So we have a satisfaction I think - both are just the same. So we have to be discreet in anything that we do. It cannot be a fad, it cannot be an -ism, it cannot be a hard and fast line. You see all made for you, God has made everything for you. You must understand what we should eat, what will suit us. That is to be found out on a person, what sort of a personality he is. In our Sahaja Yoga many people take to vegetables, and many people have to take to meat eating. And by that they will improve their health very much. He is one who was suffering from high blood pressure, God knows how many things. He just dropped it like that and he keeps low on meats I think.
(Q: asks confused question)

Warren: Do you find that more people today are sicker, in general, than they were fifty years ago.

Shri Mataji: No doubt. Q: Why?

Shri Mataji: Because a time has come, to see, this is a time you are born for it. Many children are born realised these days, so many children. Now we have in our ashram, about nine children, very beautiful ones, all born realised, absolutely they are. You can talk to them better than you can talk to, ah, even a very well educated person. When I talk to them I just find I am just one with them. So this is the time, the resurrection time, this is the time that is the last judgement, and that's why so many have taken birth for their judgement, alright?
(Q says something)
Warren: She's asking whether more people are sicker today than they were fifty years ago. But I, the question is obvious, I think medical science and statistics have proven this, so I don't think there's any question there.

Shri Mataji: No, no, but what's she saying - physically?
Warren: You want to know why, she wants to know why ..

Shri Mataji: Why they are physically sick, is it? Your judgement ... You see they are physically sick because they have lost their roots, they have gone to extremes and imbalances. We cannot go to imbalance, you see, religion is to keep yourself in balance. There are ten religions in the human being, like ten valencies, as carbon has four valencies, we have ten valencies about which all the primordial masters who came on this earth have taught. Like Lao Tsze, like Socrates, we can say Abraham, Moses, and many in India also. They came and told us that we should keep the balance. Balance of our life. Keep in the centre, for the ascent. If you are not balanced you cannot ascend. But people have gone to extremes. They are faddists. Whatever you tell them, if you tell them that see, now you are not well, so you do something, they will do it so much that they'll outwit everything. They’ll always go to the extreme of everything. So, that's how the problems are there. But doesn't matter. But moreover we are sick because we are seeking. Because we are not satisfied. We feel unhappy, we can't sleep, we don't know why we are living. Is the other way round. We are not seeking because we are sick, but we are sick because we are seeking.

Q: Why is the Kundalini identified as the female form?
Shri Mataji: Why ...

(Warren repeats question)

Shri Mataji: Because it is the Power of God, and God is regarded as He, and the Kundalini as the Mother. He as the Father, and the Holy Ghost as the Mother. She’s the Holy Ghost, so because He’s the Father, we have to have a lady with Him so we call Her the Mother and one should not feel bad about it, men should not feel bad at all because you all had a mother. You could not have come on this earth without a mother. You just can't help it, that's how the nature is. You have to accept the fact. Mother is a surety isn't it? Yes please?

(Questioner tells Warren question)

Warren: Do you have a Guru and at what stage did you receive Self Realisation?

Shri Mataji: I neither have a guru nor I want you to have a guru, you better become your own gurus. Secondly I’ve been born like that I never got any realization or anything I just got realization, I should say human realization when I understood what was the problem with human beings, I worked on the, all permutations and combinations of human beings because I wanted to have an en-masse medium by which I could give realization to thousands of people because any discovery which is made and is not brought to that level, it is absolutely detrimental to the growth, for example ah, you see Jesus was crucified – why, because he was alone, only for his mother, nobody knew what he was and that time he could not achieve this because you all were not there at the time and also other people you know how the saints have suffered how every prophet has suffered because they could not create a mass understanding of it so at a certain point it has to become a mass thing. In the tree of life there are only three or four flowers in the beginning but when it grows when the blossom time comes then so many flowers are there and they become the fruits. So I, I just saw that this is the time I have to do this job, so you would call it my human realization when I understood human beings of course even now sometimes I get shocked the way they behave I mean I just don’t understand, but I think now I understand them.

Warren: for those people who can’t quite understand that answer, don’t think about it too much

Shri Mataji: Theres another gentlemen who was asking a question.

Warren: Mother has to be somebody special but find out for yourself that’s the best way

Shri Mataji: You don’t worry about me, you worry about yourself (laughter), I must be someone alright even if I’m not doesn’t matter if you are going to get it why not have it. The gentlemen there … yes please.

Q incomprehensible

Warren: no, tonight she just gave an introductory lecture tomorrow night and the next night she will cover completely the subtle body

Q incomprehensible

Warren: the whole system

Shri Mataji: But You shouldn’t come late tomorrow

Q What if you can’t get the three days

Shri Mataji: What is she saying

Warren: If you can’t get the three days and you seriously want to settle into it, the film is being taken

Shri Mataji: But why are you worried ... let us see for the present why should we be in the future? You will get it, why not? Why, what makes you - what makes you think if you don't get it, you are not going to miss it, we have people here, we have luckily an ashram, a beautiful place, you'll like it, can go there, they will give.

Q: What's the first step to self - realisation?
Warren: What is the first step to self – realisation?

Shri Mataji: There is nothing like first second, its not a course you see the kundalini its an awakening within us which takes place which is like a living process alright so the kundalini rises and shoots off here (Shri Mataji puts her hand on Sahastrara) now some people feel the kundalini wobbling down there down below (Shri Mataji puts her hand behind her back) some people feel it in the stomach some people feel it here (Shri Mataji puts her hand on centre heart) some people feel it here (Shri Mataji puts her hand on centre vishuddi) but most of them feel it here only (Shri Mataji puts her hand just above the Sahastrara) , jutting out like cool breeze. So you just can't say what is the first step, depends on how it rises. So everybody doesn't feel the same way, so I can't say that this is the first stage, alright of course first you feel thoughtlessly aware, you become thoughtlessly aware, first thing that should happen to you when the Kundalini crosses this centre (Shri Mataji points to her agnya chakra). When it comes out of it you start feeling the cool breeze here (Shri Mataji puts her hand above her Sahastrara) and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands, you start feeling the cool breeze around. That's the second stage when it can do but some people really are so great that they become absolutely doubtlessly aware, what we call as Nirvikalpa. They achieve that, some of them are really they are just there, they are so beautifully made that they just become that, there's no question left in their minds. But they become so powerful I'm amazed sometimes how they become so solidly understanding themselves.
So there are some people, I know, who are very, very great and they just start emitting vibrations, they start giving realisation, they start, ah, curing people, they can do it!
So don't condemn yourself in any way, that's first condition in Sahaja Yoga. So should we now have Realisation? Those people are sitting very much behind should come in line with others, will be better idea. Yes, just move in, as much as possible, nearer.

Warren: If you just slip your shoes off it helps you to

Shri Mataji: Yes, it is much better, because this Mother Earth helps you. Better to take out your shoes, will help. If some people want to sit on the ground also it's alright, but you should not be very far away because - it's better to attend to them, alright? If there are chairs here, yes

Warren: There are plenty there.
Shri Mataji: mm Good.

Warren: There are plenty of chairs here.

Shri Mataji: The children can come here, come along, come and sit here, there's a lot of room for the children. Children are the best, I'm very happy see them, here. Alright, come along, sit down, sit down. Please come along, look at their confidence. Sit down. Aah, great.

Warren: Just slip your shoes off, huh?

Shri Mataji: Just slip off your shoes alright? Great people, mm, you too, you too, yes please, take out his shoes, just help him, you see, look at him, how he's alert. There are so many children as I told you are realised souls. And we have to understand them. Alright.
So now you have just put your hands towards me like this, simple, put your both the feet on the ground. Touch the Mother Earth with your feet. Just. And be relaxed. You are not to do anything that will make you tense. Means, if you have anything tight here, or tight there - just loosen it. Do not tighten your body also too much, don't push back your head, or push forward, just be in a relaxed way, sit straight. Put your hands towards me like this.
And as I said the first condition is to say that "Mother I am not guilty", at least sixteen times. Is a punishment for people who feel that way. Before we start, let us tell ourselves that we are not guilty because I am talking of God Almighty. He is the source of all Joy, but He's the ocean of Love, He's the ocean of forgiveness, He's the ocean of compassion, and what mistakes can we commit? So don't start with your guilt at all. You are all God's people, you must get your Realisation. So just tell yourself, closing your eyes, in your heart "Mother I am not guilty," say sixteen times is the best way because there are sixteen petals here, and this is the centre gets blocked if you feel guilty. Please close your eyes, and don't open your eyes till I tell you. Now, just close your eyes, see. Do you feel the cool breeze in your hand? The children? Yes, that's it, the children are already feeling, it's all born-realised.

(Aside: Look at that. We should have brought our children also, so sweet they are.)

Are you feeling? Good. You are all realised souls, that's why you've come here. Now, the left hand, as I said, is the power of desire so you put it towards me, left side. That means you have to desire your Realisation. Keep it comfortably on your lap, it's alright. Now the right hand represents the power of action, so we have to use right hand to symbolically suggest our desire through this action. First of all put your right hand - don't open your eyes, please don't open your eyes at any cost, that's important because if you open your eyes the Kundalini won't rise above Agnya Chakra. Now put your right hand on your heart. Don't worry about anything whether you are going to get it or not, but just put it, put little, sit a little straight, you should not, ah, slouch down, yes. Put your, please put it on your heart. And now say in your heart, that "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask a question. Because Spirit resides in the heart. Just ask a question, "Mother am I the Spirit?" Ask three times.
Now put down your right hand on your stomach, on the left-hand side. Now this is your guru principle, is your master principle, which has to be awakened. So you say, ten times, "Mother, I am my own guru, I am my own master." Just assert it, its there, you just have to say it before Me. "I am my own master." If you have been to some gurus or anything it will be all neutralised within you. So just say "Mother, I am my own master." Because these gurus, actually, kill that Spirit in you, kill that principle in you. Please say it ten times.
Now again raise your right hand to your heart. And now with full confidence in yourself, because as you know, you are the temple of God. Say that "Mother I AM the Spirit." Say it twelve times, "Mother I AM the Spirit."

(To Warren: Just on the Void, put your hand. Alright. You use the light behind me, put that)

Now, raise the same hand, higher, onto the forehead. We have missed one centre where you had to say "Mother I’m not guilty" because the Spirit cannot be guilty, it is sinless. But here at this point you have to say "Mother, I forgive everyone." Now some of them said that "Mother it is difficult to forgive." But it is a myth that you are not forgiving. It's absolutely myth. You are doing nothing to that person who has harmed you or to those persons who have harmed you, you are just harming yourself. So just put your hand across, hold it tight, and say "Mother, I forgive everyone." Hold it, just press it a little bit from both the sides. Hold it properly and just press it. Squeeze in, I think, towards the centre, so that all extremes will disappear in the centre.
Now put this hand on top of your head, near the fontanelle bone area, where you had a very soft bone as a child. Try to press it with your palm, try to press it with your palm. It's quite heavy still. At this point I can't cross your freedom. So you have to say "Mother, I want Realisation, please give me Realisation." You have to ask for it otherwise I cannot force it into you. Say it seven times please.

(Aside: Warren: Still some Void
Shri Mataji: void and Agnya.)

Now you raise the same hand, for a while, on top of your head and see if there's a cool breeze coming in. Just move it forward, backwards. See if there's a cool breeze coming out? Good? Alright. You can change over now. Don't open your eyes, but change over see from the other hand. Put the right hand towards me, and put the left hand on top of your head and see if there's a cool breeze coming in. First you will feel it on top of your head, and then in, on your hands

(Shri Mataji blows twice)

You can always change your hand and see. Once this hand, once that hand. But don't open your eyes, but put the other hand towards me.

(Blows once)

(Aside: Shri Mataji: Mm?
Warren: It's very good (cool?).

(Shri Mataji blows four times)

Now, if you have felt on your head just try to put your hands towards me and see that, if you are feeling it in your hands. Further. You are seeing at the back, now see it in front. Now, in the hands you might feel it, just try in your hands.
You may raise your hands, high up, like this - you can open your eyes - and raise your hands like this. And ask a question that, "Is this the power of God? Is this the power of Holy Ghost? Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Just ask the question. Are you feeling it? Something happening in the fingers? You'll feel very relaxed, first of all. Extremely relaxed. Alright? Now just see if it is happening. In your hands. Just see in your hands, put them back. Alright? Is there now? Not yet? How many of you are feeling the cool breeze in the head? Please raise your hands. Is good? And in the hands? Only in the hands. Alright, it will work out. Now keep your eyes open. I'll tell you another way how you can raise your own Kundalini. You just watch me and you do the same. You put your left hand near - towards your Kundalini like this, while sitting down. Let's see. Now, sit little erect, alright? Now. And then, this right hand is to be used like this, you put the right hand across, front, below, back, up. Like that. You move the right hand like this. Just start moving it. Now bring it higher, over your head, put it high, and just turn it- give it a twist and tie it up. Try again please. Put this finger, hand, in front like this, with a right hand you start moving in this manner, which is a clockwise manner, just start moving - move it properly, that's very important. Keep one hands - steadily moving. Now give it a twist again, and, one other knot. There are three powers, so for the third power we give three knots, not putting down our hands. Now let's do again. Now put it up. Tie it up once, you don't put down the hands. Again, give it a twist, knot, another one, nicely, now see if you are feeling the cool breeze. Feeling? You can open your eyes. Now more people must be feeling cool breeze in their heads, it's so high as that, some people are feeling - yes, true, you can feel it higher - lower, anywhere, just see. If you don't feel it you have to say, "I, Please give me Realisation Mother", that's all. You have to ask for it, that's all. With your full heart. It's there. Alright? Good. You just ask for it. Just for the asking! Because that's your own right. Alright? All the children have got it, beautifully. So May God Bless You All, I'll be here tomorrow again, and I'll tell you about the imbalances we have, how we create them, how to get over them. In two lectures I hope I'll be able to cover lot of things, but as you know, knowledge is like an ocean, and I don't know how many lectures so far I have given, thousands, and so many are on the tape, and you can listen to them, about various dimensions of our spirituality - what is the Spirit, how it manifests, what is the creation - everything is there, you can come to our ashram, which is a very beautiful place, and can listen to it, you can borrow from them and enjoy it for yourself. Tomorrow I hope to see you again, and day after, so I establish this Realisation with you. I would request you to bring some salt, sugar and water tomorrow, which I can
vibrate for you, which will be a good thing to take ah just bring little bit - not much is needed – just to vibrate. Thank you very much.

Warren: I think tonight we'll let Mother go home. She's had a long day...

Shri Mataji: Ha Ha.

Warren: And take the chance of meeting Her tomorrow night...

Shri Mataji: I'll meet everyone, individually, tomorrow, because today they fixed me up with everything, ah, television, radio, this, that - I was rushing everywhere see - and, I came in the morning by plane and you know what it is like. So if you could excuse me today, tomorrow I will be definitely here for longer period, and I'll meet all of you individually, and also if you have any questions, it's better that you write them down, in the p, in the paper, and bring it here. Another thing I would suggest that you must take the books - have you got them.

Warren: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Books, but don't read them tonight because again your head will be off. But you can take the photograph, and, ah, you can put your hands towards the photograph with a light before you, because photograph has got vibrations, it has the same co-efficient, it gives vibrations, luckily, you see, it's very good. So if you put your left hand toward the photograph - first, with a light - you will start gradually feeling the cool breeze, right hand outside like that, you see like an outlet given. The whole thing that's wrong there, passes out of this hand. Then you'll put your right hand towards the photograph, and the left hand outside. At this time, before sleeping if you do it, you can have a, a little basin of water, in which you can put some salt, and put your feet in it so the water sucks in problems within you. It's very interesting to use all the five elements. We are using light, we can use the water, every sort of thing is to be used, just to give us proper balance. So, I hope you take the photograph, and do the (?) tonight, and don't discuss about it, talk about it, because you cannot understand it, with this limited brain, it's an unlimited space where you have gone. Thank you very much, May God Bless You.

Warren: As you leave tonight, for those people who would like to follow it up we are very happy to let you know where we meet each week, so that you can learn about Kundalini, about the chakras and develop your Realisation. So give to the person standing at the back your address and telephone number...

Shri Mataji: why don’t you tell them address now, no harm

Warren: no, certainly

Shri Mataji: and the telephone number its better if you write it down also give your name but also

Warren: we have the ashram the centre is at 1267 Burke Road Kew

Shri Mataji: again

Warren: 1267 Burke Road Kew its very easy to get to right theres two tram stop practically on the doorstep. However that address is written or its stamped on the bottom of a sheet that is enclosed in the little booklet that we have at the back at the hall our phone number also is there its 801696 you’re very welcome to come and see us on Sundays at the moment we’re planning to have a workshop where you are all welcome to come and spend time with mother and she’ll be able to talk to you more closely and show you in more practical ways how sahaja yoga how this kundalini awakening can work within you um when mother said bring salt sugar and water its to bring a small quantity of those particular substances because they can act upon our subtle body because they embody some of the essences that we have within ourselves just a small quantity in an opened packet you know so that it is easy so it is easy to reach ok

And just for your own sakes as much as anything what often happens is you know its quite hard to even comprehend whats gone on this evening ok you’ve come along, you’ve been given realisation and you know it’s way beyond our own comprehension as to whats really happened and its so easy to go away and think oh no they were telling me stories it couldn’t possibly be true it is true, believe it we can help you find that out and establish it within yourself and just to help you if you can give us your names and addresses I’m certainly not forcing you to do it or anything like that but if you can do that then we can keep in touch with you and help you establish it further.

Shri Mataji: (?)After all you must know that sometimes it may take a little time of course it works instantly but something wrong inside then it takes time so give more time to yourself, a little patience with yourself as I have patience with you you must have some patience with yourself and just try to understand that this has to work out that’s very important if it has not worked out it will have to be worked out. May God bless you

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
