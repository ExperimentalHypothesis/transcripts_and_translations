This was really a very memorable night for all of you. I don’t know what to say about Nishat Khan. I think he should be given now the title of Ustad, no doubt. The way he has played, I have never heard anybody playing so well, never before. And specially Tappa. Because it’s a very different, I have never heard anyone playing Tappa on sitar. Once only, Siddheswari Devi, as I told you. She sang before Me this Tappa Raag. She was quite an old lady at that time. But I was amazed, She sang it so well, absolutely the masterer. And I also called her ‘You are an Ustad’, I called her.

That’s what I feel now today the way you have really entertained all of them. Also, they appreciate and understand music, that’s the best part of it. See, all these people who are sitting here, I know them, if you would have played till five, six o’clock, they would have sat.

It’s a... it’s a present to them, for they are serving a great purpose. My father was a great connaisseur and supporter of musicians, and always used to say you must always respect artists, because they are specially chosen by God.

That’s all I want, because this is our greatest sampada.” [Shri Mataji talks aside] Means the property, sampada, kya? Yogi: Heritage. [Shri Mataji continues the talk] Heritage and the property. Inherited property of our country. And no country has this. This is something so great and this should be used to convey the blessings of God. Also, I have seen vibrations flow much better when there is music on. With the music so many vibrations starts, just... it’s just like... it’s like some puja or aarti, I don’t know what it is, but music has this power. So this is was his desire and I also found that for Sahaja Yoga our Indian music is going to help a lot. Now, all kinds of music styles are coming up, but I’ve seen, once they hear the Indian music, they don’t want to hear anything else. That is for definite. But there are, there have been some great composers, no doubt, but the way these days the music is on... I think the speedy music as you have played today will really break their heads and they’ll understand what this Indian music is. I was very happy that you could come because these musicians mostly come in Guru puja, so they must also have somebody here of your repute, of your great achievements before them and to hear them...
