Can I say a story on the subject of building? Once, we were at Brompton Square. It was '83, and Brompton Square was virtually finished by then—looking absolutely beautiful, all golden and wonderful. We noticed there was just one wall that had not been wallpapered. So me, Antonio, and another guy had this idea: let's wallpaper this wall as a surprise for Mother.

She was going to an international conference and was going to leave about three o'clock. She said she would come back the next day, early in the morning, so that gave us plenty of hours to wallpaper the whole wall as a surprise. We waited for Mother to go; we had this surprise prepared. Mother was looking so beautifully dressed when she went to the conference, and oh my goodness, we were really amazed. Mother knew what we were thinking; we were just waiting for her to go so we could do the surprise.

At last, Mother left with Sir C.P. "Now we can decorate that wall!" We started decorating, and 10 minutes later, Mother was back. Sir C.P. would often forget some important documentation; this was quite common. Mother caught us in the act. "So, what are you up to?"

"Oh well, we are decorating this wall."

"I see. Remember this: when you start something, it's not auspicious to leave it half-done, so make sure you finish it. If you start it, then finish it. If you must, take plenty of coffee—drink as much as you want—but finish it. And there's one more thing. Sir C.P. does not like a gap between the wallpaper. That looks very unprofessional, I'm sure you agree. When you put wallpaper up, you mustn't leave a gap. So, not because of me, but because of Sir C.P., make sure it looks professional."

"Of course, of course! Antonio is a professional; he's an artist. He would never leave a gap in the paper, and neither would we. No gaps, guaranteed."

We finished the whole job by about 5 a.m., and we double-checked and double-checked: no gaps whatsoever. We went to sleep, and about 9 a.m., there was a ring on the bell. We were all asleep, exhausted. The bell kept ringing. "Oh my goodness." I went to answer the door, and it was Sir C.P. He had gone straight to work and was at the door ringing the bell. He said, "I wasn't sure whether to ring or not in case you are resting, but I checked the vibrations, and on vibrations, I felt that one of you at least must be awake." Yes, that was right; I was awake.

So Mother came in. She didn't look very pleased; we could feel there was something wrong. She didn't say anything about the wallpapering and went to bed. She got up at about midday. We went to see her, and she was a bit gloomy. We thought, "My goodness, Mother should be very pleased with this beautiful wallpapering we did." But she was really sad.

We said, "Mother, didn't you like the wallpapering?"

"Of course I did, very much."

"So what's the problem?"

"Well, Sir C.P. saw a very big gap on the wall."

"That's not possible! We checked it three times. There's no gap whatsoever."

Mother said, "Yes, I'm sorry, there's a gap on the wallpaper."

"Impossible, we checked it! Absolutely not there."

"Shall I show you?" So Mother stood up and went to show us the gap. We looked at it. Oh my God, what a gap on the wallpaper! I think it's called shrinkage; it must have shrunk during the night or something. Really, we could have died that moment, all of us.

Mother said, "Don't worry about it. Let's fix it with vibrations. Just push it." We didn't have faith for that. So Mother started pushing the wallpaper. We were looking at her and she said, "Don't you help me, please? Are you just standing there watching me? You push it too." So we all started pushing the wallpaper from all directions. The paper didn't budge a millimeter.

I said, "Mother, it's too late. It's totally dry now, overnight. There's nothing you can do. We'll strip it off and start again."

"No, no, no, you see, you don't get the point. It's not you who pushes. It is the vibrations that actually do it. Just push. Push it! Have some faith."

We pushed a bit more with Mother. We felt sorry for her; she was pushing and pushing, but it never budged. Nothing. So we knew we had to have a big meal now and get lots of cups of tea for encouragement, and then we'd have to strip the paper. We did that. We had a big meal, big cups of tea, and thought, "Well, let's do it now. We have to strip the whole thing off and start again."

We arrived there. "Okay, where is the gap?" "Oh, it's here." "No, no, not there. There." "Where? Where?" We started looking, but we couldn't find the gap. The gap was gone. It disappeared while we had lunch and a cup of tea. So the vibrations did it in the end, but not in front of our eyes.
