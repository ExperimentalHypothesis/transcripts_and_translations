Shri Guru Puja. Dollis Hill Ashram, London (UK), 8 July 1979.

Today is the day of Guru Purnima, this is a full Moon day, that's why it is called as purnima. The guru has to be like a full moon, means completely growing, completely matured.
There are sixteen kalas or the phases of the Moon, and when the complete purnima comes in, the full Moon day, all the sixteen kalas are completed. You also know that in the Vishuddhi chakra there are sixteen sub plexuses. When Krishna is described as Virata, He's called as the Sampurna, the complete incarnation of Vishnu's aspect, because He's got the sixteen phases completely done.

So today's number is sixteen. Six plus one, seven.

Now we have to understand the importance of guru. Why should we have a guru when we have God? We've got Shakti, then why should we have a guru? What is the need to have a guru? Guru means "the weight," the weight. We get our weight from the magnetic forces of the gravity of the Mother Earth. So guru means gravity, a gravity in a person. Why do we need a guru? Because to know God is easy, specially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him. As soon as you get your Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, the modern Sahaja Yoga, immediately you become entitled to give realizations to other. It was said that guru is the person who makes you meet the Divine. That's not true, because any self-realized person in the Sahaja Yoga can raise the kundalini and can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahastrara or opened the Sahastrara. But normally a realized soul cannot do it. Any born realized soul cannot do it on its own, it has to have authority of Me as I am today

That's why it was said that guru is a person who makes you meet god; he raises the kundalini and makes you one with god. Because in those days when the gurus were self realized, when the gurus were realized, they had the authority and power of raising the Kundalini only after they had reached a very great state of evolution - complete purification, complete detachment.

So it was not possible for people to give realization when they just touched realized state. Most of the gurus in the olden days started by first cleansing the people. First cleanse them, one by one, raise the Kundalini, brought it to every chakra and then gave them realization. It was a different technique altogether. You can say it was a bullock cart technique.

That's why one mantra was given for particular chakra where was the problem, where the Kundalini was stopping. For about, some people used to get it for even for 10 years they would work out on one chakra. I've known people who have been working on Agyna for 10 years, 20 years. But you know in Sahaja Yoga we clear it out just like that. That has something to do with your particular guna [ulterior?].

So the first conception that a person who makes you meet god is the guru. Has to be little bit advanced because for you now it's a childs play to raise the Kundalini and make them one with the divine. But still you don't become guru in the Sahaja Yoga terminology. Even if you have vikalpas, you have doubts about Sahaja Yoga still you can raise the Kundalini. Even when your chitta - attention is not clear cut still you can.. the pure truth, how? How it has worked out that way, so beautifully?

It has worked out I would say at this juncture, maybe later on I will tell you. But its pure divine, which is not contaminated by whatever state you may be, its flowing, absolutely pure divine. With others it was different, they had to cleanse it, clear it out. As an instrument you are perfect, but as a guru you are not.

Whatever maybe your defects or whatever you maybe lacking, you raise your hands the Kundalini will vibrate at your beck and call. On your fingers it is going to vibrate tremendous power. You can ask anyone they'l tell you they are surprised and jealous of you. They can't understand that how by raising your fingers that you are perfect instruments because you are created by somebody very perfect.

But you are not perfect gurus, that one has to understand. And that is why you need a guru to tell you that what is percept.

Now as I told you that guru means gravity. You cannot say where is the axis of Mother Earth is? You cannot see it, I mean you cannot see it, you cannot feel it. But they say there is an axis on which Mother Earth rotates. It's an energy, an energy on which this Mother Earth rotates. In the same way you have an axis, which is your Shusumna, which gives you the gravity.

The first important thing for a guru is that your gravity point is one, everything centres on gravity. Unless and until your attention is completely fixed on to that gravity point within you, which is called as 'dhruva' - in the fixed point, you cannot become a guru. So the gravity in you comes to you by clearing your attention by looking at your attention where does it go? How do you reach your gravity point or anything that has a gravity point? How do we discover it? We go on balancing it and when the balance is complete that time we say this is the gravity point.

In the same way your attention should hold your gravity point in complete balance. So the first thing is that you should be balanced. But a balanced person is not a fixed person. He is not rigid. But an imbalanced person is a person who runs here, there, there. Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga running after this, running after that, running after that. Such a person cannot achieve much. Fix your gravity point - balancing point in Sahaja Yoga.

This is much important than doing anything else. First of all fix your gravity point, then you'll be amazed that whatever you see apart from Sahaja Yoga in the light of SAhaja Yoga you'll realize that how it relates to Sahaja Yoga and it relates to you gravity point.

Say it is against it, still you will see where it is against. If it is for it, you'll see where it is for. For example you'll read books immediately you will know what is the truth, what is not the truth. But if you do not have that point fixed or attained, then you'll be slipping down this side or that side. Everything else can attract; you can slip down from truth. So that point has to be fixed first of all within ourselves.

'Dhruva pada' you can call it. The Kundalini position of the fixed point from which we understand that everything radiates from it. Everything is controlled from here - the light within us by which we see what is darkness and what is reality. But to all this even if you glorify and say all the names and chant everything it has no meaning unless and until you develop discipline about it. Discipline is the 'sthai bhav' or you can say the 'emotion of permanence' for a guru seva or becoming a guru.

You must discipline your body, discipline your mind, discipline yourself. Say in Shaja Yoga its such a simple thing to have , I mean you are just collectivity, but you are not a guru. So how do you discipline yourself?

Some people, say, have awkward way, in their body. Then they should get to it, they have a proper way in their body. Mould your body. It is not to torture your body but to be master your body. For example: I would not say that you go and sit in the cold ice water. Its wrong, you freeze yourself and make your bones horrible. But you must do all that is required to give you a supple body and a body that can live under any circumstance. Little bit of course you have to insult also that you should be able to sit on the ground properly, that you should be able to sleep on the ground properly. There should be no problem about these things. You have to discipline.

Sahaja Yoga is a real blessing, but can be sometimes a blessing in disguise. If you take it for granted you'll drift out. You wont go very further. So the body should be such that it should be able to take lot of load upon itself, should be able to do lot of work. This is for you to decide about your own body. Now you see your gurus body how it is? I take lot of work out of My body. I work for hours together. I can keep awake for hours together. I'll never even once say that My body is no good. It is such a nice thing I have. But it, there is a very great tapasya - penance. Tremendous penance, because it's a human body which has to work out somethings, you know at the time of Rama, He had to walk bare feet all the way. He was a king and He had to live in a hut.

So do not be dominated by luxuries and comforts. I do not mean to say that you unnecessarily torture your body, that is not the point at all. Because I must give a balancing point always. But do not pamper your body that is become a hurdle for your penance. Keep your body clean. Respect your body. And it will be very happy when it will know that you have used it for the diving purpose.

There's a Indian word, which we call it a 'bhaitak'. I don't know if there is a English equal to that. But 'bhaitak' means the power to sit. That's the gravity. How long can you sit in one posture? "What is your 'bhaitak'?" Like any studies or anything they'll ask, "What is your 'bhaitak'?" "Have you got the 'bhaitak'?" Is the power to be seated on one point. How long can you sit continuously? That is how you judge your gravity. Unless and until you have a 'bhaitak', you cannot be a guru.

So the body is to be brought round properly. It has to be sublet. There's no question of becoming thin or fat but the body should be such that you should be able to use it for your purpose as a guru. Sometimes, you will find you can't sleep on the ground. When you sleep on the ground 3-4 days, your body will be very happy. It will pain 1 or 2 days, it will pain. But do not insult your body.

See the other side of the situation - we don't take our bath, we don't keep ourself all right. Then we are insulting our bodies. Look after it. You may have to look after its softness, gentleness of the body. Treat it with respect. By becoming barbaric you are insulting your body. So the body is very important. This is made of five elements. And all these five elements within us, as gurus, has to be sparkling.

I can go on like this but now you think about it. You think what have you to do with your body. How you are going to use five elements within your body to cleanse them, make then beautiful so that your light sparkles. The gravity comes to you in your body this way that you start generating your power or your principle of gurutva, principle of your mastery through this point of your gravity.

The second point is your attention should have that gravity. Your attention is very important. A person who is easily disturbed is not a deep person. Or easily taken to something like say emotions or easily to some other say intellectual pursuit. As gurus there will be temptations. People will be challenging, if a person comes out with a very big intellectual fleet or something like that. Then immediately you'll feel challenged about it and you say, "All right let me handle the situation". Handle it at the Sahaja Yoga point, on your gravity. Just sit down on your gravity and see to ittself. Immediately you will know how to handle the situation. You need not talk to that person, you'll handle the situation all right. Not on intellectual level but on your gravity.

The attention has the gravity; it pulls down the ego and the superego of other people. Then you will not be frustrated offright. Also if you can start from the outside it may work out in human beings; it works out. Like study your behaviour how you behave towards others. Or study your attention how it behaves towards outside - what attracts your attention? What attracts your attention? Study your attention, by that study you will be able to fix your attention in its maryada - in its boundaries. Once you put the boundaries to the attention then the depth starts developing. The person who has no boundaries can never have depth, he will be spreading just like that, always, no depth at all. So you have to put boundary by understanding your attention, that no not more than that, all right not more than that.

Some people in Sahaja Yoga I've seen, they get interested in a patient. For them that patient becomes important. Or get interested in some person that he must get realization - say my mother, my father, my, my . And all the time they are talking about it - my jobs, my clothes; some sort of a my and they don't know how to draw the line. You must know where to draw the line, is maryada. Otherwise the whole thing will flutter away, you'll become a frivolous person. There won't be any gravity. So you must know how far to go with a person when you are dealing as a guru. Then you are a master. But if you do not know where to draw the line, you may be crossing the line and getting into his cluthes.

So the best way is to handle the situation is to get into thoughtless awareness. Again and again and again and again you establish that. Some of them complain to me that its not easy thing to do. It's the easiest thing to do, if you give up all other useless things that you are doing. And then gravity will give you the wisdom to do the right thing at the right time.

Ashram is the place where one has to learn to be a guru, but I find it is a not always a good experitment. Once they have an ashram, they take it for granted. They think this is the place for us to nicely come and live and some people will work, some will be enjoying, some will pay some will not. Its most .You must immediately find out the person who really has the spiritual authority and try to follow him. Instead of that we try to mix up with people who are of lower spiritual authority. And he sleeps till 9.00 'O clock, everybody sleeps, in an ashram nobody should sleep after 6.00 'O clock, its an absolute thing. Absurd, you must sleep early get up early. You all must get up at 6.00 '0 clock, you know what time your Mother gets up? And what I find that nobody is up here. In India they all get up very early. But I find that nobody is up here and My attention is on Me.

And you don't realize that how important all these things are this is the training time for you. For this you are born, you've been seeking this for ages now, you got it now, you must discipline yourself, but I've seen in ashramas where people pay a big amount, they get a better service 4 O' clock, 3.00 O' clock, because in Sahaja Yoga everything has to come from you. This is the time it is.

At the most I can ask people who are not all right to go out for a while live outside and then join ashram. That helps a bit, but not more than that because I am also a Mother though I am a Guru. It is you who should mature yourself you'll mature much faster than I force things on you. Finding faults with others but not with yourself. Must have a discipline, a time in the morning to get up, do little pooja or something; at least spend half an hour all of you together. You should be ready by 6 or 6.30, sit down, do meditation. I have to lay down rules for you now because you do not want to lay it down. I am also amazed that many people do not know My arti even after so many years, by heart. That is what Sahaja Yoga is, is because it's a Mahamaya. So you have to learn it yourself, you have to do it yourself.

Its easy to talk about Sahaja Yoga, very simple stand up and talk because you've heard from your Mother, you talk. It will have no impression on another person; it will flitter away, because must come from your centre of gravity. This is the greatest thing you can do to yourself is to discipline yourself fully. And completely disciplining yourself and make your body all right, your attention all right.

Attention is corrected by many ways. As I said watch your attention, where does it go?

Now what else are we going to talk but Sahaja Yoga? Is there anything more beautiful or more interesting, more manifesting than Sahaja Yoga is? And what is the job of the guru? Is nothing but to expose the prarabrahma itself - the whole working of the Divine, that is the job of a guru. To expose the complete working of the parabrahma is the job of a guru in the modern times. Not only raising the Kundalini. But after raising the Kundalini you should be able to tell about all the divine powers and everything. For that you have to learn, you have to read, you have to understand. Do you understand now the difference between old guru and modern guru? Because they brought with such tremendous discipline that hardly one or two would be guru. They went through such studies and such interrogations and examination and test that by the time they were 75 or so they became gurus. But we have to be quick and the best way is to rate yourself.

Perhaps the tradition of the western countries do not give much impetus for discipline. That's called cutting off yourself. But a disciplined person is the only one who can be a Sahaja Yogi. Spontaneity works best in a disciplined person. Discipline person is the one who knows the technique and the energy is the spontaneity. But a person who is frittered away what will spontaneity do with it? It cannot work it out, the instrument is so horrible. So you discipline yourself and others will be disciplined by your behaviour.

Once you have disciplined yourself, when you become a guru, you have certain priviledges as master. And it was used as a weapon by many masters before, you need not use, I am just telling you as a side issue. All the gurus had tremendous temper. Like I would tell you Allaudin Khan Saab who was a great musician, was the master of Ravi Shankar and My father was the political advisor to this Maharaja of Mayyar and we went down there, I was there also. That time Ravi Shankar was artist of fame a bit here and there. I mean he is quite a good artist still though his guru had a very great respect for My father. He used to treat My father very revered. So he was playing something, he was very good at Mridang. He played the Mridanga for My father. So in that days the tune, the lahara is there, tune has to play was a simple tune just to play the mridangam to be played on that. So My father asked Ravi Shankar to play. [missing lines]

And at the slightest they will take a bass and hit you, see. So people used to be very careful when they were sitting near the stone. The people would stay away from them. They would throw stones; they'll keep a chimta, big chimta like this. Anybody coming near them they would hit them. At the slightest thing they gave a chimta to a disciple. It was a long thing, you know, made out of iron and a chimta is a double prong thing. And they would hit the person thomb like that. It was the situation before I came in here as you know a guru, you see it is difficult to be a guru and a mother I cannot do both things together. But that was the situation, even those great artist today who are playing great things like you'll hear now we'll have Khan Saab you go and ask him about his guru, how much time he was beaten up, absolutely beaten up any swara they did wrong, was absolute chastity, absolute discipline. If the guru said, "Five o'clock tomorrow," even if guru comes or not, five o'clock you have to be there. For any art in the Indian style was like that - complete discipline. Without discipline not even education was imparted. Terrible taskmasters. And that's what they used which you need not use, here in Sahaja Yoga.

There is no need to use temper in Sahaja Yoga. That is because I've not given you, imparted any knowledge to you, with temper. Perhaps there could be hardly anyone who has seen Me in a temper. So that is not the way we Sahaja Yogis are going to impart knowledge to others. We have to be very mild and sweet because in the pattern of your own guru, because She's sweet, She's very mild and She's very persuasive and kind. In the same way you have to be, because that pattern you haven't learned. That's why don't take to that kind of a pattern where people are in a big temper and they come out with a big temper. It doesn't behoove a Sahaja Yogi to be like that. I mean, they had such tremendous powers also that they could just make somebody into ashes, see, with such a temper they lived. And they had one guru somewhere like a - I would call it Rock of Gibraltar - that you face him and you hit your head. At least one surprise - you must have a good hitting from him. Otherwise he is not your guru. That was the system.

Now we have a great artist sitting here. He must be also remembering his, [UNCLEAR], his guru, who must have really beaten him nicely before he imparted knowledge. They said, "Without you hit and chisel you cannot make a good disciple." And this time you are going to challenge that and to prove that our Mother was extremely kind and still you are chiseled out beautifully by your own chiseling. That's why I request you to do it yourself because I cannot do it, as a Mother.

And that's why it is your responsibility. I mean, that way today is the day where we all have to decide that we are going to be gurus now. I am going to retire as a guru; it's all right to be a Mother to you people. Now you have to be gurus of other people and for that you must know what you should achieve. You have all the powers within you; you can manifest them also. But you cannot have a following unless and until you become a guru. This is the only difference there is. If you want to have a following then you must chisel out yourself in that fashion that as soon as people see you should say, "Here is somebody", with that gravity.

I think that would be sufficient for today. We have Puja. Only thing, a last, most important thing is that you cannot make a drama out of it. It has to be a reality. See, by standing like a big, imposing person, you do not become that. On the contrary people will think you are mad. It should be from within that you should develop that dignity within yourself, that poise, that balance, that understanding, within yourself. A kindly poise, a beautiful personality, benevolent but standing above everyone else by his gravity, depth, gentlemanliness, generosity, proper bearing, neatness, cleanliness, above all, love, heart like an ocean, most forgiving.

I'm sure next year we'll have some gurus here who have already got some disciples around.

May God bless you all.
