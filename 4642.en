QUESTION : What are the curing powers coming from the supraconscious as there are so many people who are curing other people with supraconscious power and what is the difference between this curing power and curing power of the Kundalini ?

MOTHER : There can be two types of curing power. One could be those who get the power of the collective subconscious and those who get the power of the collective supraconscious. Both can cure depending on where the problem is. For example a person with the power of the collective subconscious can cure problems of the left side. And a supraconscious person can cure the physical side.

We have two types of people in India known as Mantrikas and Tantrikas. The Mantrikas are those people who go to the funerals and cemeteries and they try to capture the dead spirits. These dead spirits are of the sly type. These sly spirits are the so-called 'social workers' or 'busy-bodies' trying to help others. They are in the category of Chaturvarnas or Vishudhras, the people who believe in serving others. They appear to be good people because they want to serve other people and help others and that is why they do not want to die and want to stay around the earth plane. One could call this a 'servant class'. They are absolutely servile. They like to be whipped, beaten up and be ill-treated. They are another extreme. They enjoy a horrid type of existence-they are masochists. All such dead people are around us and they are left-sided bhoots i.e. very timid and clinging. These mantrikas get hold of such dead people and tell them to do this work or that work, control this or go there. And these bhoots feel very happy about it as they are servile. So, if there is someone suffering from a mental problem, for example, someone of his has died then he gets a mental push-back into the collective subconscious and gets possessed. Such people go to the Mantrikas and these Mantrikas tell the dead spirits that you have been troubling this man for a long time and you leave this man. So they remove this dead spirit and put another dead spirit in its place and tell the first dead spirit that he can get another body to go to. These Mantrikas are the mediators or liaison officers. They catch hold of these spirits and remove them from one man and put them onto some other person. So the first person is 'cured'. For example, there was a lady whose husband used to drink quite a lot. She went to one of the lady Mantrikas who said she will cure her husband but the lady must pay Rs 1 00 for that. So she put a dead spirit on this man by which the 'bhoot' of the drunkard on him was removed. So this man gave up drinking but he started going to races. Then she solved that problem by removing the "races' bhoot" and put another one by which he started going to dirty women. Now this lady got frightened. Every time she would pay Rs 100 and had ended up by paying a lot of money. Then she complained to the lady Mantrika about it. After that she found that her husband was doing all three things together. So she went to fight with that lady Mantrika, who put a bhoot on her too. Since then, that woman is still mad and I have not been able !o cure her. She is a very good looking woman married to a very rich man who owns a factory and this is the life both of them are leading i.e. burning the candle on both ends. This is the case of the subconscious people.

The second case is of the people of supraconscious type. For example "Dr. Lambs International Curative Centre". "International bhoots" he had ! You have to write to them that you are suffering from such and such disease. All the dead supraconscious people the very ambitious type i.e. all the great doctors, all the 'great' lawyers all the 'great' scientists, all the 'great' engineers and architects, Hitler and all such great' warriors gather on the right hand side. When Dr. Lamb died he met all his friends there and he could communicate with them because these doctors did not want to die as they had been experimenting with this or that. So they started Dr. Lamb's Clinic. Now this Dr. Lamb who died lived in London and had a son. Dr. Lamb's spirit attacked an ordinary soldier in Vietnam and told him that he was Dr. Lamb from London and that he better go to his son and tell him that you want to start such a clinic. He didnt attack his son as he knew that his son would not be able to bear him as the son was not healthy. He wanted a very healthy and sturdy man whom he could possess. So the soldier went to his son and said that "your father is within me and he wants to open a clinic". The son would not believe it. So the soldier went into a trance and told him that I have got some money in a secret place kept for you and he had talked in secret about it. So the son believed and started the clinic for him. He gave all that money for the clinic. And all the 'Bhoot doctors' were helping this man to act whenever he wanted and an intercommunication was established on that level i.e. the collective supraconscious. A lady who was suffering from high blood pressure, kidney and uterus problems went to them. They told her to write a letter to the Centre in London who wrote back that on this particular day, at this particular time we will appear within you and cure you but you must lie down in your bed. On that particular day and at that particular time she started shivering and one of the 'dead doctors' entered into her and she got cured. For one year she was alright. But then she started feeling very dizzy. When she came to me she was in a tattered condition. Absolutely Finished. She knew that a spirit had come in her at the time she came to see me. She said and knew that there were at least ten or eleven within her and she could not bear them. So this kind of curing also can take place from the supraconscious. Supposing there is an architect and he approaches such people he can get the spirit of a dead architect upon himself. Now this Jack the Ripper was possessed of the spirit of a dead ripper. One hall to have an inclination for such things. This weakness is there within such people, that is why they are easily possessed. Otherwise it does not happen. Only if you are weak in mind and have weaknesses for such things, then these dead spirits can catch hold of you. If it has something to do with your physical side then the supraconscious can help you. If it has something to do with your mental side then the subconscious people can help you. But they help you very temporarily and then come back with a big foursome.

But Sahaja Yoga makes you so powerful and so pure that impurities just fall out.     It is a cleansing force. It is a very different thing where your intention is not to cure but as a by-product people get cured. Now many dynamic things are happening. In Australia I met an Australian couple who were journalists and the lady was the president of the Journalist Association of Australia. She could not conceive. Doctors said she can never have a baby. Still they kept having tests done as the husband wanted a baby very much. But after coming to the Sahaja Yoga she conceived after about fifteen years of marriage. Now her entire idea of life has changed. First she indulged in all kinds of therapies. She was a Catholic to begin with and then went to different gurus and tried different therapies. She overcame all that after coming to Sahaja Yoga. Now she finds the answer physically for I have made all bhoots get out of her. Now she said she is going to expose all such people. I told her that if she could write what these people are doing she would be able to show that this is madness. And once you have talked about it then you can prepare a base for Sahaja Yoga and then show that this is the reality which makes you sane, powerful and loving. Then only people are going to get convinced. Sahaja Yoga achieves miracles, on the material level, on the mental level, on the emotional level and ultimately on the spiritual level. You are all endowed with such tremendous powers for you are realised souls, and if you want to give realisation you can. For example, this lamp which is enlightened may be unclean or may not be good to light but once it is lit it can enlighten others. Similarly your Spirit is pure. But we have to fight all these 'bhoots'. On the unlimited I am working very hard. That is how they are exposed. But on the limited you have to work hard to fight, you should prepare yourself to fight these evil forces for they are the ones who ruin your own being. There will be a big depression coming on and people will just obstruct it. They will trouble you like anything. But you have to fight it and for that you should be evolved. It is strange that all great people, children of God, men of God, are born more in the west than in the east. They have been born in countries where there is a lot of affluence and they do not have so much poverty and troubles and these are the very people who are lost. For, the modern concept of life is to make something that can be demolished very easily. We should realise that the reason for this is that our foundations have been made very weak by the satanic forces and they have built it since long. That is why our ideas are very weak. In the west if you observe the behaviour and life-style of the kings and the queens, and the kind of life the people lived was so debased and horrifying. Even what the so called "religious" people and the Catholic churches did was so horrid that these very foundations were shaken. Now you have to rebuild your foundations. You have to lay new foundations for dharmic life. You have to absolutely accept the dharmic way of life. That is the only way to make your foundation strong again.

In India the foundations are good especially in Maharashtra, but the yearning and aspiring is not there. For example, an aeroplane which is so perfectly built that it can never fly. And another aeroplane which as soon as it flies goes into pieces. So one must realise that the damage to our foundation by the satanic forces is much deeper, much more subtle than what you understand. You have to fight these very foundations. These horrible kings who kept seven wives etc. are not your ideals. Your ideals are yourself. You have to bring new ideas in the western countries then only you can change it because you are such a dynamic force. Everyone of you have to rise up and build yourself into ideals and try to lead a life of that ideal within. For this you have to sacrifice. And the greatest sacrifice is that of your ego which makes you so obstinate and hardhearted. Face yourself. This ideal has to be created. One has to have compassion; one has to have love and understanding. Never talk ill of one another. Never. Try to help each other for we are very few and we cannot afford to fight among ourselves, for we are wedded to a very great cause. We cannot have wrong ideas, we cannot waste our time on mundane things like marriage.

If marriage has to be, then it has to be good and compatible and you must try to patch up your problems. You have to make it a beautiful institution. Do not indulge in small and petty things, for otherwise we cannot carry out this task because we have still a very long way to go in life. These satanic forces are very nicely built up and very united in these western countries. They did not bother about India because India is a poor country. The blessings of poverty are that it teaches you to have a proper foundation. The poor are just the same as the rich. The very rich are not your ideals nor the very poor. You are your own ideal and you have to create new ideals. You are the new presidents of America and prime ministers of England. You are the ones who are great people, so you have to stand up to it, i.e. people of character, generosity, of hard work and proper understanding. Otherwise you cannot do this task. It is very easy to study and get degrees like MD, MA, PhD, but to bean ideal you have to mature. You have to constantly tell yourself that you have to come up and you have to do this tremendous work which is not difficult because you have the source under your command. Everything is possible. Just ask for it and it will be done. But build it up. Even now if you cannot build up your personality and new ideals then when are you going to do so ? I am here with all the chakras intact. It is easy to justify yourself, i.e. this is wrong or that is right. Finish all this. You have to become That. So the first is that you change your foundation. We have great people like Shakespeare, Tennyson, Mozart, Jung and tremendous people in this country also. Taking their name itself liberates vibrations. In those countries single-handed they created their ideas and just think how in those countries they must have fought all these satanic forces. But who accepts these people ? Everyone of you is capable of being like them. Everyone of you has to become a leader. In Poland an ordinary factory worker did that but he was not a realised soul. He could not communicate with God. He had no way of knowing the Absolute. So channelize yourself properly, cleanse yourself properly and dedicate yourself. For dedication you have to do nothing but give up your ego and superego. Take these loads off and create a space which is the heart and it will work out. It is easy to kill these rakshasas but what about the lost souls ? Everything will work out for a year or so or even two years. After that I am going to blast them. Before that you should be ready because once I blast them they will come back on you people. So you should be such top people that you are not finished by that.     It is the easiest thing for me to blast them    all, finish them off. But first they will    go to the subconscious and then they will    attack you again. So I want them to live    with paralysis, with diabetes, with all sorts of things. And they will live, they won't die. It is a tremendous task. And I am working twenty four hours, I have no sleep and no rest and you know that. I can see the whole vision very clearly of those beautiful days when we all will be enjoying each other and the bliss of God together. All that I want is that we pull out so many human beings in the clutches of the evil forces for which we have to dedicate ourselves. Our attention is on too many useless things, materialistic things. There is no end to it. Be satisfied with less. You will be looked after materially also. There won't be much problem. So don't run after so many things. Just don't have interest in these. It is all trash. You should be loving and affectionate. Once you start giving up the Real you become hardhearted persons. "I have no interest in anything." Then who has interest in such a stone as you ?

You are the foundation and your children will talk of you, not of these horrible persons. You have to be ideals of love, affection, and not of domination and all such nonsenses.

All of you will be the first Sahaja yogis. You are the ones who are going to change the complete concept of life. New ideas have to be built up. Are you people really aware of your responsibilities ? Sometimes you are worried about yourselves only, "where I am catching ? What is happening to me ? ' It is so self-centred or you are worried about others, "he should not have done this or that. He should not have sat next to Mother." Nobody should think they love me more than anybody else. Some people know more rituals, others know more protocol but does not matter. I know the one who loves me. The one who loves others loves me the most. I don't care for you,- protocols and rituals. It is nonsense for me. What does it matter to me ? The one who loves others is the one who really loves me. I have had all these rituals and protocols and I have no care for these things. It makes no difference whether you say good morning to me or good evening to me. What you say to your brothers and sisters is the most important thing. Sahaja Yoga will never work if you do not look after that side, i.e. how you behave towards your wife, husband, your brothers and sisters. That is the most important, thing and anybody who does otherwise will get out of Sahaja Yoga. You know I have thrown out the so called important people out of Sahaja Yoga who tried to dominate others by saying "this is not good. You should not put your hand there. Don't put your feet there etc., etc."

Who can know the protocol of the Divine mother. You cannot bind me into protocol. You cannot bind me into anything. I am unlimited. I am detached. To think that, you have me attracted towards you by your protocol, which is dead, has no meaning. It has to be a living protocol of being kind and generous. Be beautiful Some are lethargic. Like a husband who wants the wife to work all the time or the wife who wants the husband to work every time. Everybody finds fault with each other. They are not Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogis are the ones who take it Sahaja. If somebody is not working that person will go down. I will put that person out of Sahaja Yoga. Why did you come to Sahaja Yoga ? You are seekers. You have been seeking for ages. Are you going to waste your life ? In any case you have to sleep most of your life. Why not work it out now ? In every way be active.

Firstly you become real and very good citizens and with moral values which are your foundation. You yourself judge. You are realised souls. I leave it to you to judge. You will lose your vibrations. You can become silent. Silence can be from other agencies. Negative forces from the left side of the Agya are giving ideas. You must have your own ideas. "I can't, I go on thinking" this nonsense goes on. Just tell yourself how dare you do all this nonsense of the left side. Those who are left sided better go for lemon treatment and shoebeating. Those who are right sided better shoe-beat 108 times. Get in the centre. You should really love yourself, cleanse yourself and be in the centre. Never be proud of your ego. 110'1 think this is correct". Beat yourself 108 times. You can be very high handed and then you can have no embarrassment of what you are doing. You can be absolutely shameless. But you are a Sahaja Yogi. You should feet embarrassed about such things. There should be a little 'sankoch'. There should be reservations about it. How can you say such a thing to some one? Why hurt anyone ? Agya bloats more and more. So many are like that. I know where somebody tries to show off, tries to be a Guru and tries to push down others. "0'1 know Sahaja yoga. I am a great Sahaja Yogi". Then I make their 'ego-horns' come out. You can feel it jutting out of your head. Push it down. This is the sticking point. Though the balloon goes thin, it sticks on. You are all Buddhas. Buddha is the one who is realised, the one who is enlightened, one who knows. You are the enlightened ones. How can you have an ego ?

Ego and super-ego are the greatest enemies. I have seen people who suffer from super-ego. You push it down and it goes to the ego. So in the west we have the greatest problem of the ego. Whatever appeals to the ego we run to that. That is how people are made mad by these 'gurus'. They say you can fly, so you have gone into it. Somebody says you will become very powerful, so you have gone into it. Somebody says you will become a great guru and you go into it. But nobody says you become the Spirit and become One with the Whole. When I say you are realised, you are great, you are saints there is more bloating of the ego-balloon. I say it to create that awareness within you. Your ideals have all been full of ego. See Churchill standing there with a stick in his hand. The complete body looks like the ego. We have to form new ideals. He was right for meeting another ego called Hitler. So it was alright to break their heads together.

But now we need new ideals. The past ,is over now. When there is flood you need boats to carry you across. But after reaching the shore you don't carry the boats with you. You leave them behind. These boats are no good for us. They have done the job. Now we have to go ahead with our own feet. So no bloating of the ego should be there. We should realise that we are in no way exceptional, for only you are blowing up your ego. You have to be ideals. You have to be in the centre. You have to be a Sahaja Yogi. That is the most important thing. Don't judge yourself by what you think of yourself but what Mother thinks of you. How much joy are you giving to your Mother ? If you make Her unhappy then what is the use.

You must have noticed that there arereally very few true seekers in this world. And seekers also must realise that they cannot be happy with anything else but their Spirit. This is the test of a seeker and a non-seeker can never understand a seeker. It is very difficult to live with a man or woman who is not a seeker because you catch all the bad points and you suffer. If the person has an ego you catch it on your Agya. Nothing happens to him. He is very nicely off. He has his ego intact, and he is torturing you. But a person who is a seeker is a better person because you can give realisation to such a person and your vibratory awareness can be shared. But to be with a non-seeker can be a very difficult situation. You cannot make a fruit into a flower. In your case you have become the fruit. But you must have a flower around which you can make into a fruit. Those who are entangled with problems like "my father, my mother, my brother, my son" etc. should learn not to get entangled with such problems. Those who are not flowers should be avoided, forgotten and lost. The more you try to improve them the more entangled you will become. They can never improve. I give you a big rope. If they are not seekers then they will never be so and you cannot inject seeking into them. They may become materially well off but they can never become seekers and you forget about them. You may have to suffer because of them, for if they catch, you suffer. If they have a nabhi chakra you suffer. This kind of person is very difficult to change. Do not waste your energy. Christ has side "do not cast your pearls before swine". You cannot force anybody to become a seeker. There are millions of seekers in the world, so forget about such relationships. They may call you mad or crazy or anything but they will realise one thing that you lead a much better life than they do. You are much more peaceful, blissful, dharmic and sane but they won't accept your life. Play around with them with the understanding that they cannot change. Even if they change mentally they cannot have that urge because to a seeker nothing is important except seeking.

QUESTION : What about the people who are good people, not seekers, but who have got realisation but don't seem to see the significance of Sahaja yoga ?

MOTHER : They will go out of circulation. Sahaja Yoga rejects more than accepts. It is a judgement going on. Such people will go out of realisation. You can talk to them of realisation, give them bandhans etc. for, they are the people in whom you could be interested but they are lost otherwise. For example, butter is made out of curd by churning. A little butter comes out and the rest is butter milk. To separate it, a big lump of butter is put in the butter-milk and when it is churned all the butter gets around that big lump and gathers into a larger lump of butter. But some butter particles are left behind. If they do not stick to the larger lump of butter they are thrown away with butter-milk. So, those who do not come to Sahaja Yoga and are not up to the mark, will be thrown out. It is a fact but you should have 'nirpekshita' i.e. you should have no attachment to such people.

May God Bless you.

Answering to another question Shri Mataji Said :

The question is that the psychologists say that mind is limited, i.e. whatever the mind does is limited. Whatever action we perform is done through mind only and this mind has limited energy and so it cannot take you to the unlimited. So something has to be which i3 beyond the control of the mind, that is the only spontaneous thing. Now see the confusion. But their question can be answered on mental level. What is the basic difference between Divine and human ? How to convince ordinary humans of Sahaja Yoga and the Divine ? They are doubting you as you are doubting them.

The simple answer is that whatever you do with your mind like shouting, howling, jumping etc. can be done by the limited mind. So one who is doing is some human agency, some human being and not the Divine. But you cannot make your Kundalini pulsate with your mind. The Divine , if it has to do something, it must be extra-ordinary which human beings cannot do. To pulsate Kundalini is only possible for the Divine. It is a living force. Man makes things-dead things. Man can do dead actions. But a living force cannot be activated. What is the need to go to the gurus if they make you do the limited actions of the mind. You can always shout, howl and jump without them. But you cannot make the Kundalini pulsate.

Divine does something which you cannot do.    You cannot make the cool breezes flow    from your hand. So, if you go beyond the mind it has to be something extraordinary, something different. The limited and the unlimited are two different dimensions. This is the secret of your Mother's Maya, that I live on unlimited and do unlimited things. That is how I create Maya. You can know me only through knowing your vibratory awareness. If you put your hand on the head of someone nobody can make you shake. So the Divine force is something that human beings cannot do through their mind. I repeat, you cannot pulsate the Kundalini. It is a living force and human being cannot create or generate life. They cannot make the pupil dilate when the Kundalini goes up. As ordinary humans and so-called gurus cannot feel the vibrations you cannot talk of the vibratory awareness to them but you can see with your naked eyes. They cannot make the cool breeze come out of your head. This is something extraordinary. What I can do with the limited is make myself. I can also do unlimited. That is the side of the Divine Mother. In the same way you are limited now but you have jumped into the unlimited. So you can do all these things. That is why you are saints. The things you can do in the unlimited you could not have done before realisation. You start doing something that you could not have done before, i.e. to raise your Kundalini and of the people.

The gurus, so-called, can shout, howl, jump and do all these things but they cannot raise the Kundalini of the people. All other things,. we can say, are arbitrary, subjective. Then, you will get your cure, change your mental attitude and all that.
