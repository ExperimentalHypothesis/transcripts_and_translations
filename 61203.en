It came very late, I don't know why or what happened but it was very late. I think we had our lunch and we were resting and I hope you have rested well. Have you or not?

Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: And we have some public program also because we are coming to a room and give you all the dates and all that and you can also join them because it's so [unclear] to you and enjoy the music a little bit. Now the thing is, tomorrow morning, do you like the place where you are now?

And the food is nice, [unclear], everything fine? So tomorrow morning then we will all have to come to Puja about then o clock.

If you could finish the food up at twelve, you could have your lunch and you can also see them this Sadashtini's temple, I think which is a must for everyone in Sahaja Yogi, God said. And then, from there you have to go to Sanghamaya which takes about, they said, you can take Two hours. Two hours, which is there at seven o'clock, working program is there at seven o'clock, in any case I will teach there and I hope you will make it also and then you are going to stay in Sanghamaya for one night again.

So in Sanghamaya we have nine program and one time I think we are all leaving for Pune, that they will tell our organization. But anything is missing or anything you find critical, you should let me know. If there is any problem. I know there was somebody who had a [unclear] and he was standing with us. Who is the gentleman?

Shri Mataji: So that makes all the sometimes the problems are connected with you.

All right, at least you people should clear him out tomorrow. When he's there you all can work it out, clear him out, otherwise you will become sick and auspicious. That's why maybe [unclear] problem but his negativity is very wrong on the negativity and things work out that way. Nothing wrong with him, he's a Sahaja Yogi in any case. He should cleanse him and tomorrow I will cleanse him before we leave because he doesn't know that he's sick. That's why he can't go to the hospital. He will cleanse him and then he will be able to do something. Otherwise there is no problem to be diagnosed. All right? Who will take charge? James?

Yogi: James is between 10th

Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: uhh?

Yogi: James is within 10th.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Somebody has to take the charge of that. You may not be able to do it. Somebody who has David can. David? Please take it over there. All right? See that he's cleared out on the left side and then he comes over. Thank you very much.

Now let's have the music and I hope it will be all right for you sometime and then you can go back and sleep. Did you sleep in the daytime? I inquired if they have slept around. They said yes, they were all sleeping under the tree. It's nice. Sometimes to be like that.
