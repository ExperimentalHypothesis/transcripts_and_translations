Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji!Shri Mataji: Thank you. Very good.Dr. Bohdan translates the author of the song. She sings it in front of Your Photograph, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: Eh?Dr. Bohdan: She sings it in front of Your Picture. Yogini: When I was doing a sewing for Sahaja Yoga I composed three songs. Dr. Bohdan: When she was doing a sewing of, a design of Sahaja Yoga, that’s when the idea of the song came to her, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: It’s very beautiful. Very beautiful. Is the expression, you see, I don’t know how to really express My love because I must learn your language.Sahaja Yogis (laughing). We all study English, we all study English, also. Shri Mataji: Please (10.43), we have to, we must learn English. Easy to speak, English is a very easy language. Because of your script I cannot read, otherwise I may learn it very fast.

But script is Greeks’ script they use. Otherwise... it’s very easy to know. But I have taken a book, let’s see now. I have no time, I travel so much, you don’t know how much I’m traveling all the time. Now I’m going to South America also, Latin America, to Colombia, to Peru, to Chile, Argentina, Brazil. Then to this side: Taiwan, Bangkok or Nepal, Malaysia, Hong Kong, then Australia. And also, in Europe, you see, all these countries. They are all waiting to meet you all. So many wanted to come. But just now there was no arrangement, you see, we thought that it would be difficult to accommodate them.Galyna: No, no. We can accommodate them in our homes.Shri Mataji: I know dukhom, I know the Spirit.

(Sahaja Yogis give over some plums for Shri Mataji)Shri Mataji: Thank you. What do you call these in your language?Sahaja Yogis. Sliva – plums, green plums.Shri Mataji: These are plums, they are green, and there’s red also. We call it alubukhara, alubukhara.Dr. Bohdan: Is it sour, Shri Mataji?Shri Mataji: No, it’s nice, very nice. What about apricot, what do you call it in your language, apricot?Galyna: Abrikos.Shri Mataji: The oil of apricot seeds is very good for the hair.Galyna: Is there any of our fruits that can be used instead of lemons because here they are very expensive?Dr. Bohdan: Is there anything that can be used instead of lemons for the cleansing of negativity in this country?Shri Mataji: Chillis can be used, these (Shri Mataji points to the plums) can be used. Candle: best is to use the candle – left side. You see, put the candle like this on the photograph, hand like this, the right hand on the Mother Earth. But the best for serious troubles like cancer or anything, like radiation in Kyiv1 you were having, you see, for that you have to use three candles. One with the Photograph, one to be kept here – left Swadishtana. The third one is to raise the Kundalini. For any incurable psychosomatic, like cancer or anything. Then the Parkinson, when your hands shake, you see.

Galyna: What can we use in our country instead of Ajwan dhuni?Shri Mataji: Ajwan dhuni. Is also there. Very good for cold.Dr. Bohdan: She wants to know what we can use in this country instead of ajwan, for the purpose.I don’t think we know of anything...

Galyna: It’s pity that we don’t know the botanical name, the Latin name for Ajwan.Dr. Bohdan: If we knew the Latin name of ajwan that would be helpful, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: A very big name [ed - Trachyspermum ammi]. But I can send you by [SOUNDS LIKE – mons], whatever you want. You let Me know what you need.Galyna: Oh! Thank you very much, thank you very much.Shri Mataji: You wanted, you wanted to have Ajwan. Any amount Ajwan I’ll send you, any amount. Next time with Arun Kumar I will send lot of Ajwan. What else you want?Galyna: Also, some red clay which one take inside along with honey.Dr. Bohdan: The red clay, Shri Mataji, that we use for the left Nabhi, with honey. Shri Mataji: Gheru.Galyna: Gheru, gheru.Shri Mataji: All right, gheru I’ll...Galyna: We have brought some green clay from Kyiv and, if Shri Mataji allows, we can take it to the programme.Dr. Bohdan: They have some green clay from Kyiv which has been used in past for cleansing purposes, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: Green what?Dr. Bohdan: It’s a green clay that they dig out under Kyiv and they also use it for cosmetics, basis for cosmetics.Galyna: To be taken inside for cancer problems, as well as to apply outside.

Dr. Bohdan: They use it for caltesis, they eat it for oncological problems, cancer problems. Galyna: To be put outside, on legs.

Dr. Bohdan: It’s an ancient natural method.Shri Mataji: What?Dr. Bohdan: Green clay, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: But effect is what? Is this hot or cold?Dr. Bohdan: By vibrations, it’s cool. Galyna: It’s cold. Dr. Bohdan: They would like to show You that in the program, Shri Mataji, and see whether it can be used instead of gheru.Shri Mataji: You see, all these things are meant - either they are for right side or for left side, even food. There are left or right effects. Say now for fruits, like these, the sour fruits we can call the citrus fruit, like these (Shri Mataji points to the plums). These are, these are for the right side. Liver, over-activity, too much thinking. And also rice – carbohydrates, I mean, carbohydrates. And for the left side it’s more proteins. Now some things, like clay is cool, it should be used for the right side. For liver.

But if you have gout or if you have arthritis, all that, that is due to the left side. Left Nabhi. For that you have to use something that will heat it, like ajwan, like what you call cloves.

There are many things which are in effect are heat, they are good for the left side, very good. For example, left side you use the light, you see, and the Sun. But the right side you use water or ice. Gradually you will know everything now, because you have got your Kundalini in your head, so it will give you all the light and you will know all the knowledge.Galyna: Mother, You have already sent medical reference book to us. Dr. Bohdan: Mother, You have already inspired some medical knowledge in them.Shri Mataji: Eh?Dr. Bohdan: You have already inspired some medical knowledge in them.Galyna: You already sent us in English language. We will translate it.Shri Mataji: That we have written down certain for liver, this, that. But not yet complete. I mean, there’s all kinds of diseases people have.Dr. Bohdan: There is this book...Galyna: We have, Kyiv has.Dr. Bohdan: Kyiv has this book.Galyna: Yes. And translated here.Shri Mataji: You have had, you see, there are boils coming at wrong places, it’s radiation. Radiation. So, you see, the radiation is the one which is heating you.Galyna: Here a lot of erysipelas cases have come up.Dr. Bohdan: She says that a lot of inflammation have come up in Kyiv. Inflammation of the legs, red... Reddening. And in Czechoslovakia also. Shri Mataji: What do they say? Dr. Bohdan: Nothing.Galyna: Nothing. Shri Mataji: You see, this radiation can be overcome with Sahaja Yoga.Galyna: They do not want to relate this with radiation. We asking for help from our Mother. Dr. Bohdan: We ask for Your help.Shri Mataji: Nothing can happen to Sahaja Yogis. You are in the Kingdom of God. Who can touch you? Just enjoy yourself.(All the Sahaja Yogis say several times, “Jai Shri Mataji”)Dr. Bohdan translates a Sahaja Yogini. We know that You are God, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: What should we offer them, we have nothing in the house to offer them.Sahaja Yogis: It’s all right, Shri Mataji. We are happy to be here with You.Shri Mataji: Very kind, very kind of you. Very kind. Very kind.Dr. Bohdan translates Sahaja Yogis: We are very happy to be side by side with You, Shri Mataji, and give our love.Shri Mataji: May God bless you.So, are you coming to Togliatti for the Puja?Sahaja Yogini: There is no tickets. Shri Mataji: Really? Next time we should have a Puja even in Leningrad also.

A Sahaja Yogi: If we are sick or making mistakes, Shri Mataji, do You find it difficult to carry this? Please translate.Dr. Bohdan (translates): If we are sick, Shri Mataji, do You find it difficult, do You also find it difficult to carry this? His question, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: They are sick? Dr. Bohdan: No, he is speaking I think hypothetically. If we are sick, do You find it difficult to carry us, to be with us?Shri Mataji: I should, I’m worried about you. On the contrary My body is more compassionate than Myself. It just sucks in all your problems. You must surrender, that’s important, you must surrender. There have been so many miracles like this. In Prague only two days back a very old lady came up, she all her has everything and nothing moving, brought her in a chair on the stage in a very bad shape. So she said, “Mother, I’m sorry I’m in this shape, but I completely surrender myself to You. I know what You are and please if I am not cured I will not say anything.” And I told her, I said, “Now you get up!” And she got up. And then she stood up herself and then she ran. Everybody looking at her, you know, she went running. Even in Moscow it had happened. Doctor, you remember? Dr. Bohdan: I beg Your pardon, Mother.Shri Mataji: That lady in Moscow, that lady who came to us. She couldn’t walk. She had Parkinson, I think, or something. And she just got up – (aside: “Hatha yogi?”) - and she just walked and when we were going in the car we saw her running for the bus.Galyna: Tell that we can tell some miracles.

Dr. Bohdan: We also can tell You an interesting story of a Sahaja Yogini in Kyiv.

Galyna: A 18-year old girl came from Ivano-Frankovsk in a wheel chair. Dr. Bohdan: A girl came from Ivano-Frankovsk (West Ukraine) on crutches.She saw the video tape of the Leningrad Public Program and stood up. We taught her and now she still living in Ivano-Frankovsk and walks and runs. She had encephalitis.

Galyna: Yes. Her name is Galia. She is thirty years old. She could not walk for 11 years. Dr. Bohdan: She wasn’t walking for thirty years, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: Wow.Dr. Bohdan: It wasn’t crutches, Shri Mataji, I’m sorry, it was a wheelchair.We have a letter from her. Yogini: Now she sits on the ground. For 11 years she has not walked nor sat on the ground, while now she can walk. She is very happy.Dr. Bohdan: This lady has not walked or sat on the earth for 30 years, Shri Mataji, and this is the first time she has been able to sit on the Earth and walk and she’s so very happy. Shri Mataji: Who?Dr. Bohdan: This lady we are talking about now, Shri Mataji.A Sahaja Yogini: First, I saw Shri Mataji in October in Leningrad and I came there on crutches.Dr. Bohdan: She says: I saw Shri Mataji first time in Leningrad in October and I came there on crutches. This lady here.

Yogini: Yes, yes.(Sahaja Yogis say several times, “Jai Shri Mataji”)Shri Mataji: It is your own power.Sahaja Yogini: And Your, and Your power!Sahaja Yogini: In my embroidery in the first line I wrote “O, beloved Mother, You have saved me!”.Dr. Bohdan: When she was sewing on the side she wrote the first sentence: Oh loving Mother, You have saved me”.Galyna: And me and he.Yogini: Have they translated what was written?Other yoginis: Not yet.Shri Mataji: I can see, you see, you can make out a Sahaja Yogi the way they are just like flowers, they look so beautiful. So happy, all the time laughing (Shri Mataji laughs).Dr. Bohdan (translates a Sahaja Yogini): We just sang the song, that we are flowers and You are our Gardener. (All are laughing).Shri Mataji: I’m the Gardener. I am the Gardener.Dr. Bohdan: Yes, Mother.Sahaja Yogini: Later on, in this song there are words: We are Your flowers and You are The Gardener, Mother, so pour on us Your Divine blessings. Dr. Bohdan: Wow. We are Your flowers, Shri Mataji, and You are our Gardener. Therefore pour on us Your Godly blessings. Shri Mataji: Ah.Yogini: Light will make the darkness go. Dr. Bohdan: Light will make the darkness flee.The Sahaja Yogini: And the garden of Paradise will bloom in love forever.Dr. Bohdan: And will the garden of Paradise flower in us.Shri Mataji: Oh.(All the Sahaja Yogis say, “Jai Shri Mataji”).Shri Mataji: May God bless you. Beautiful thought it was. Yogini: You should still make a programme.

Galyna: Maybe we are tiring Shri Mataji. Other yogini: Shri Mataji should rest.Shri Mataji: We have to put them in the garden, because we have no flower pots. Dr. Bohdan: They are worried, Shri Mataji, that they making You tired.Shri Mataji: Eh?Dr. Bohdan: They are worried, Shri Mataji, that they making You tired now.Shri Mataji: Tired?

Galyna: We know.Shri Mataji: And in the morning I think of you all.The Sahaja Yogis: Thank You, Mother.A Sahaja Yogi: Mother, one farewell poem.In the morning having raised by the narrow path I will ask o, Mother, let me hear Your call from the Highest Gospel. Let me see the Highest Face of Immortality, a glance from the secret mansion. My eyes are shining, my road is great, I cannot hesitate by my threshold. “Take your path to the Heaven’s shelter Fight the darkness till the morn Loosing not the image Mine Went on, My son, to the Truth of Light. Don’t lose your strength in the faraway abyss I will give the love to your heart Please come back, my loving.” (Sahaja Yogis say several times, “Jai Shri Mataji”)Shri Mataji: You should write it down. Yogi: For You, Mother.Shri Mataji: All right, you write it down, then we will translate it. All right, where is the poem that you have written? Poem. I’ll ask somebody to translate it. Yes, you write in Russian language?Yogi: In Russian I write.Shri Mataji: In which way, in Ukraine language? Which language he used?Yoginis: Ukraine, Kiev.Sahaja Yogi: I am from Mineralnye Vody, Sochi, Pyatigorsk, Caucasia.Shri Mataji: All right. Yes, you write it down on a piece of paper and then I’ll get it translated. This also I’ll get it translated. Beautiful handwriting.Sahaja Yogini: Can I also write my poem down?Prostite (Forgive me).Shri Mataji: (Reading a note) Why are you asking? Why you saying sorry? Dr. Bohdan: I don’t know, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: Did she ask for forgiveness? Ah?Dr. Bohdan: Aha.Shri Mataji: “Prostite” means “forgive”. Prostite.Forgive. For what? The word “Prostite” I know, because I have to tell everyone that you forgive, otherwise your Agnya will be bad. By this I learned that word “prostite”.

Galyna: Oh, You are speaking it Russian word very nice.Shri Mataji: Prostite (Shri Mataji laughs).My pronunciation is good in Russian language, they say so. Galyna: Very well.Shri Mataji: Because I can say “s” which Russians say “ts”.Dr. Bohdan (translates). I can speak good Russian, because I know all the sounds like “ts”, “dg”, “zh” in Marathi.Shri Mataji: In Sanskrit. Sanskrit is a big tongue- twister, tongue- twister, so you can say many words easily, I mean, the pronunciation can be good.Thank you very much.(Sahaja Yogis say several times, “Jai Shri Mataji”)Sahaja Yogini: We love You very much.Shri Mataji: I love you very much. I love you very much. We have bought a house for you here, so that I could stay in Russia.(Dr. B. had missed the last words of Shri Mataji and could not translate it in Russian).Shri Mataji: I said, Doctor, that – they said, “We love you”. I said, “I love you very much, because I have bought this house for Myself, because I want to live in Russia with you people”.(Sahaja Yogis express their delight and ask Shri Mataji to come in Russia more frequently.)

Galyna: So, Kyiv ask You too.Dr. Bohdan: Kyiv is also asking, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: Thank you.Galyna: We invite You to Kyiv too, welcome to Kyiv!Shri Mataji: Oh, of course. I’ll take a house in Kyiv also. But it’s not that easy (42.00). It was something just miraculously I got this house. You can’t buy a house (here, in the USSR), very difficult. But somehow...

Galyna: We want to buy a house in Kyiv for You.Dr. Bohdan: We want to buy in Kyiv, Shri Mataji, we want to buy in Kyiv for You.Shri Mataji: All right, but... Yogini: Kirgizia, Shri Mataji.Dr. Bohdan: Kyrgyz, Novosibirsk...Yogini: Leningrad...Shri Mataji: Under law, I don’t know under law it’s difficult. This one somebody gave Me. He left the country, gave Me, so I’m here. But it’s very difficult the law here, that the foreigner cannot buy. But the only thing were that, you see, this law may change. Galyna: Yes, there will be changes.A Sahaja Yogini: Of course, but we don’t know for the better or for the worse. Another Sahaja Yogini: Of course, for better, because Shri Mataji has arrived here. Translate for Shri Mataji.Dr. Bohdan: Yes. Once You have come, Mother, it should change for the better.Shri Mataji: Yes.Galyna: Yes, yes. We believe it.Shri Mataji: I don’t know, but yesterday I came and they said all Gorbachev has been removed and all that, so I said, “I don’t know what’s happening now”.Dr. Bohdan: Sorry, Mother, there’s a...Shri Mataji: I said yesterday I came and they told Me that Gorbachev is removed. I don’t know what’s happening in this country, but we should all pray that every good thing should happen to this country now. We need something very good, prosperity to come in. Something good should happen, that’s all I can say (44.27). Should happen, something very good should happen, because you people have suffered a lot now, had enough of it. No more.(Sahaja Yogis say, “Thank You” and “Jai Shri Mataji”).Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.All right, hope to see you for the programme.Sahaja Yogis: Yes.Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.(Sahaja Yogis say several times, “Jai Shri Mataji”).Shri Mataji: You just enjoy, enjoy yourself.
