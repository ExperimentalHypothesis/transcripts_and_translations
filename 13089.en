Galyna: Is there anything that can be used instead of lemons for the cleansing of negativity in this country because here they are very expensive?

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: Chillis can be used, this (Shri Mataji points to the plums) can be used. Best is to use the candle - left side. You see, put the candle like this on the photograph, hand like this, the right hand on the Mother Earth. But the best for serious troubles like cancer or anything, like radiation in Kyiv you were having, you see, for that you have to use three candles. One with the Photograph, one to be kept here - left Swadishtana. The third one is to raise the Kundalini. Any incurable psychosomatic, like cancer or anything. When the Parkinson with your hands shake.

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: You have had, you see, there are boils coming at wrong places it's radiation. Radiation. So, you see, the radiation is the one which is heating you.

Galyna: A lot of erysipelas cases have come up in Kyiv and in Czechoslovakia also.

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: What do they say?

Galyna: Nothing. They do not relate it with radiation.

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: You see, this radiation can be overcome with Sahaja Yoga.

Galyna: We asking for help from our Mother.

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: Nothing can happen to Sahaja Yogis. You are in the Kingdom of God. Who can touch you? Just enjoy yourself.

(All the Sahaja Yogis say several times, "Jai Shri Mataji")

A Sahaja Yogi: If we are sick or making mistakes, Shri Mataji, do You find it difficult, do You also find it difficult to carry this?

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: I should, I'm worried about you. On the contrary My body is more compassioned than Myself. It just sucks in all your problems. You must surrender, that's important, you must surrender. There are seen so many miracles like this. In Prague only two days back a very old lady came up, she all her has everything and nothing moving, brought her in a chair on the stage in a very bad shape. So she said, "Mother, I'm sorry I'm in this shape, but I completely surrender myself to You. I know what You are and please if I am not cured I would not say anything." And I told her, "Now you get up!" And she got up. And then she stood up herself and then she run. Everybody looking at her, she went running. Even in Moscow it had happened. Doctor, you remember?

Dr. Bohdan: I beg Your pardon, Mother.

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: That lady in Moscow, that lady who came to us. She couldn't walk. She had Parkinson, I think, or something. And she just got up and she just walk and when we were going in the car we saw her running for the bus.

Galyna: We also can tell You an interesting story of a Sahaja Yogini in Kyiv. 18-year old girl came from Ivano-Frankovsk (West Ukraine) in a wheel chair. She saw the video tape of the Leningrag Public Program and stood up. Later on we taught her and now she still living in Ivano-Frankovsk and walks and even runs. She had encephalitis.

Galyna: Yes. Her name is Galina. She could not walk for 11 years. We have letters from her. This lady has not walk for 11 years and this is the first time when she can sit on the Earth and walk and she's so very happy.

(…) A Sahaja Yogini: First I saw Shri Mataji in October in Liningrad and I came there on crutches. (Sahaja Yogis say several times, "Jai Shri Mataji")

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: It is your own power.

The Sahaja Yogini: In my embroidery in the first line I wrote "O, loving Mother, You have saved me!") (…)

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: I can see, you see, you can make out a Sahaja Yogis the way they are just like flowers, they look so beautiful. So happy, all the time laughing (Shri Mataji laughs).

A Sahaja Yogini: We just sang the song, that we are flowers and You are the Gardener. (All are laughing).

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: I'm the Gardener. I am the Gardener.

Dr. Bohdan: Yes, Mother.

The Sahaja Yogini: Later on in this song there are words: We are Your flowers and You are The Gardener, Mother, so pour on us The Divine's Grace. Light will make the darkness go. (…) And the garden of Paradise will blow in the flowers of love. (All the Sahaja Yogis say, "Jai Shri Mataji").

Her Holiness Shri Mataji: May God bless you. Beautiful thoughts, beautiful thoughts. (…).

Q: Is high radiation affecting our energetic ability in our body?

A: Once you are Realized soul, if there are many Realized souls in your place no accidents can take place. You are protected and also all radiation, all evil forces are killed and neutralized. (…)
