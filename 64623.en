Babamama: Now a favourite of Shri Mataji. It's a song sung in the drama, Marathi drama. It's in two moods, in fact, brought out in two different ragas. And you can see the difference in the way of rendering, in the way of singing, and also in the tempo.

Shri Mataji: It’s a description of a seeker, that’s why I love it. And he says that it’s a – I don’t know- [Marathi]
Babamama: Beetle.
Shri Mataji: The beetle. The black beetle, he is singing and singing all the time and he is just enjoying his own music and he's searching the honey ‘makaranda’. So, he's searching the honey and then he gets into the lotus to get the honey. And there the Lotus closes him down completely. Still, he is singing and enjoying that lotus, honey, like that. He's like a seeker, you know, he is lost. But the whole thing is full of alliteration, ‘dunde, mande, lai’, that, you see. So, you like it that way also. And it is a description of seekers.
May God bless you.

Babamama: It's this description of you Sahaja Yogis.
Shri Mataji: Before Realization.
Babamama: Before Realization.
Those who are seeking, those. And those who were trying to find the honey, now they have found the honey.
Shri Mataji: And they are lost.

[Applause]

Babamama: It was a little meek, meek clap. I think a bigger hand is needed.
I think a standing ovation is better.
Wow.

[21:15- Shri Mataji starts to pay the musicians.]

QAWWALI

[35:42- Shri Mataji is speaking.]

Shri Mataji: You all have to retire. We all have to thank these great musicians, who are Sahaja Yogis and have rendered such a musical atmosphere tonight. [Applause]

All the songs are beautifully sung and has very deep meanings. The last one is about Kabira. And Kabira says that, "My beloved went away and I did not cry". Here, the beloved is the life that, when he died, his life went away he did not cry. "But just I was standing in the corner and accepted it". Then also, "If you don't believe, ask my friend. She will tell you that I had covered myself with a sheet and was lying on the bed. I did not fight". That's a sign of a Sahaja Yogi. He doesn't fight for life, which is very nice. The third one is, this body which is- he calls it [unclear] is where you enjoy life, has got 10 doors. Actually, normally they say nine doors, but the 10th is the Sahasrara. Ten doors and I don't know by which window she went away. Means, Sahasrara opened and he went away. It's very, absolutely sahaj song. It’s that when you die also, you are in sahaj, you are not bothered about anything you just accept the death without fighting.

The last one is, he addresses himself as if he's the daughter of Kabira, Kamala. And she says, this daughter says, "What's the use of such a marriage?" when she's married to life. "Better not to be married " means, not to be born. That must be Kabira specifism, that must have come, the way he must have been frustrated with all the nonsensical people he was facing. But our situation is very different. We are here to complete his work.

It is first time I've sat so long after puja. It's difficult but somehow, it has- I think you have sucked in the vibrations and I'm feeling much lighter. Normally, I don't feel that way. So, I thank you very much for that.
[Applause]

Tomorrow, they want to distribute presents, morning about 11:00 to the Indians. For me, it's all right. But I don't know about you people. You might be sleeping. So, let us see for Indians we are going to distribute all the presents. I hope all the presents that were to be distributed to the foreigners have been done, I hope so. There should be no misunderstanding about it.
So, may God bless you all.

Babamama: We, all the musicians, are also very grateful to Shri Mataji for all the patience she has shown, the kindness she has shown, and for all the guidance she has been giving to us and inspiration. Jai Shri Mataji.
