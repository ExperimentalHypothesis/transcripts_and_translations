耶诞崇拜

印度格纳帕提普蕾1998年12月25日‧

我首先以英语讲话,跟着才用印地语。

很久以前的今天,耶稣基督出生。你们都知道祂出生的故事,以及祂经历的各种折磨。

祂是那位作为霎哈嘉瑜伽模范的人。因为祂不为自己而活,完全没有,祂为别人而活,以开启额轮。你可能很神圣,可能很有力量,但这个世界是那么残酷,他们不理解灵性,他们不明白灵性的伟大。还有,有很多原因灵性被攻击,他们常常都这样做。每一位圣人都曾经受过很多苦。但我想基督是受苦最多的一位。如你所知,基督被赋予神圣格涅沙的所有力量,因为祂是神圣格涅沙的化身。首先是祂的纯真,我们可以说祂是永恒的孩童。祂不能理解这个愚蠢世界的残酷和伪善。就算你明白这事实,你又可以做些什么呢?但基督却以极大的勇气,在一个人们对灵性没有概念的国家出生。

我曾经阅读过一本有关祂的书籍,说祂来到克什米尔(Kashmir),遇见我的一位先祖—萨利瓦汉拿王(Shalivahana)。那是非常有趣的,因为全用梵文写成,作者或许不大懂梵文,但他却全用梵文。我可以肯定,对西方人来说,这并不太合适。感谢神,他不懂梵文,否则这将是非常危险的。书中有一段是这样写的,他问耶稣基督..「为甚么你来印度?」祂回答..「这是我的国家,这就是我来到这个国家的原因。在这里,人们尊重灵性。但我却与那些完全不懂灵性的人住在一起。」他们的对话是非常非常有趣的。因为萨利瓦汉拿王说..「有更多理由你要回到你的国家,教导他们纯洁无邪的原理(Nirmala Tatwam)。」这是净化的原则。祂回去,三年半后,就被钉上十字架。

我个人认为,西方和印度的死刑最大的分别是这样的,在西方,杀戮人是一种伟大的专业,以很琐碎细微的借口,他们杀害人。任何人若是圣人,他们都杀害,他们称他是一位行为卤莽者。这是逃避灵性的最佳途径。在印度,若这是圣人说的,永远都不会被挑战。他们相信他,因为他是圣人,因为他的品格比我们高得多。虽然有些令人厌恶的人在折磨圣人,但整体上,大家都尊重他们。任何假导师,通常都不会留在这个国家,因为他们知道会被揭露。还有,他们是那么金钱取向,所以他们走到美国,或其他国家,安顿下来,赚取金钱。这是我们必须看清的其中一个征兆,这也许是耶稣基督为甚么在一个非常非常平庸的家庭出生。就算是在孩童时,他也没有妥当的睡床。他睡在那里,他的父母亲住在一处有牛及有动物居住的地方,这些全都有用文字来描述。那是显示属灵不需要任何奢侈,也并不需要任何排场和炫耀。

那是内在的力量,内在的光辉,内在的光芒自动显现,你不需要做任何事情来炫耀它。这一类人对金钱没有意识,对其他事物没有占有的概念。他只关心身体上受苦的人,甚至是痲疯病人,他也想把他们治好,他想去帮助许多许多染病的人。因为在那时候,没有医院,没有医生,所以他的注意力都放在身体受折磨的人身上,他也在思维上为他们作好准备。在山上有那么多漂亮的讲道。那时候,人们不是那么物质主义,所以他们都聆听他,但你却说不准有多少人明白他。若你不是一位已得自觉的灵,要明白灵性是非常困难的。那位谈论灵性的人和那位聆听者,两者最基本也是要得到自觉。

从基督美丽的一生我看到,我们必须学习,除非我们是已得自觉的灵,我们仍然会折磨基督的灵魂。我们也曾经见到,这样的事情正在发生。那些谈及基督的人,祂很清楚的说..「你会称呼我为『基督,基督』,我将不会承认你。」祂非常清楚的这样说过。我不知道他们为甚么不把这句话从圣经中删除。意思是那些以神的名说话,传道和好好打扮以炫耀自己是属灵的人,基督将不会承认他们,就是这样简单。在现在最后审判的时候,祂将以灵性来评价整个世界,即以生命能量。祂的审判已经开始,我已经看到。你可以看到在那么多的国家里,事情正在消失。所有他们的自我,他们的侵略性,他们的残酷,都被挑战。那些在战争中犯错的人,会被批判。所以在历史中,那些对小区,对人民犯错的人,他们全都会被批判。他们不能作出侵略的行为以及不能再折磨人。这就是神圣格涅沙原则怎样藉由霎哈嘉瑜伽起作用。

基督没有这样说,但祂却有说..「将会有最后的审判。」一方面,祂是非常仁慈和慈悲,另一方面,祂却是真正的锡吕‧格涅沙,因为祂拿起武器,打击在庙宇里兜售的人。你不能以宗教的名义来做生意。这是怎样一件需要明白的大事。但基督徒并没有遵从,他们没有。我不知道他们何去何从?我们有圣雄甘地(Mahatma Gandhi),他常常谈论灵性,只谈论灵性。但他的继任人却把他与他的灵性放在一边,开展一个的新世界,新的念头以及新的生活方式。那些应该是甘地的追随者现在却想拥有很多的酒吧,拥有各式各样的物质,你可以想象吗?这个国会是由圣雄甘地开展,但国会却在做着这些事情,他们怎可以作出领导?

这个国家最美好最珍贵的就是灵性。除了灵性外,他们可以往何处去?他们可能不是基督徒,但他们尊重基督,他们尊重圣经。我必须告诉你这是事实,人们就是不知道。他们不是基督徒的意思是他们还未受洗,但他们却尊重基督。因为他们知道基督是那么有灵性—祂是灵性的化身,这就是印度人可爱之处。无论是印度教徒或穆斯林,对他们来说是完全没有分别。在印度,有很多穆斯林是圣人和苏菲派(Sufis),他们得到所有人的尊重,无论他们是否穆斯林或印度教徒。

所以对于基督,完全没有人会反对。相反,你们看到昨天他们是怎样因基督而那么高与,因为他们都是已得自觉的灵。就算他们不是,在这个国家,基督也很受尊重。他们不明白,他们怎能细察基督的一生?他们怎能评价基督?他们又怎能制作有关基督的庸俗电影?这是他们不能忍受的,因为他们内在对灵性的尊重比外在多得多。以基督之名,人们已经做了太多的错事,杀害了太多人,各种各样的错事都被接受。作出这些行为后,人们不明白他们怎能评价基督。

例如,我所知道的英国,我对看到的感到非常惊讶。若有任何人去世,他们喝酒,任何人出生,他们也喝酒。只有喝酒他们才能有关连。「你们怎可以喝酒?」我问他们。他们说..「为什么不能?基督创造酒精。」我说..「什么时候?」「在一个婚宴里。」我说..「在婚宴里?那不是酒,而是他们在那里种植的葡萄的葡萄汁。我们的语言称它为drakshas。这怎会是酒呢?」酒必须先发酵,必须腐坏,怎会这样?所以喝酒是一出最大的戏剧。

在印度我们知道,虽然没有人说什么反对喝酒,但我们知道喝酒是一种犯罪的行为。你看到每一天,每一个人都知道,若你喝酒,你会变得完全失去理性。在宗教的平台上,没有甚么可以说。每一个人都知道喝酒是怎么样的。在海外的人不是不知道,他们也知道。但不知何故,喝酒成了潮流。甚至在我的国家,也开始推介喝酒。我不知道为甚么在独立后,人们开始喝酒。在每一个派对,他们喝酒,在圣诞日,以基督之名,他们也喝酒。这是对基督美丽、神圣的人生的一种侮辱。

所以,当他们来到这个地球,或许他们所有神圣的力量都已经被摧毁。印度人最好的地方是至少他们尊重,他们尊重神圣的地方,这是他们的长处。他们知道甚么是神圣。当然,现在他们变得既现代化也美国化,但他们仍然知道甚么是错,甚么不该做。因着霎哈嘉瑜伽,我非常高兴的说..「外国的霎哈嘉瑜伽士也变得非常美丽。」我很惊讶,因为在他们的文化里,是没有灵性的。我不知道他们怎能离开那些荒谬的事物而像莲花一样,漂亮地冒起,以灵性的漂亮香气出现。这是奇迹。每一个人都说..「母亲,我们不能相信,这是怎样发生的?你是怎样应付过来的?」我可以说这是基督的祝福。他们看到人们怎样以基督之名和以很低下的方式来成就事情,因此他们发展了某种认知,知道必定有某些不妥之处,这不是基督,他们描述的不是祂神圣的人生,是别的东西。这就是我想为甚么在西方,有更迫切,更大的升进力量。

昨天有人来告诉我..「母亲,没有集体静坐。」我听了很高兴。在霎哈嘉瑜伽最重要的是静坐,毫无疑问的。但外国人做静坐比印度人多得多,令人很惊讶。以灵性来说,外国的男女都装备完善,特别是俄国人。我很惊讶在美国,他们告诉我..「母亲,这些美国人不是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。」我说..「为甚么?」他们没有那种对我的尊重,他们没有静坐。没有静坐的人不是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。」我说..「我同意。」他们令所有美国人静坐。我不知道为甚么东盟国家的人,如保加利亚人,俄罗斯以及所有罗马尼亚人,他们怎能那么喜欢霎哈嘉瑜伽。当然,他们有共产主义的诅咒,或许他们因此感到自己的人生有某些缺失,所以必需深入自己,这就是为甚么他们可以成就到。我必须告诉印度人,你们必须静坐。印度人有一或二种坏品质,其一是联群结党。例如,若他们是婆罗门,他们会坐在一起,若他们是Kayasthas,他们会坐在一起,若他们是Bhaniyas,他们会坐在一起。若不是这些,他们会以另一种名义联合一起。这是我的国家最差的诅咒。因为当你们联群结党,你永远看不到别人的优点,亦看不到自己的缺点,这种联群结党为这个国家带来很多问题。

在基督的年代,有不同种类的人。一是喜欢灵性,一是不喜欢。现在我们这里有些人喜欢灵性,但他们的一只脚仍然在水中。这个老问题仍然存在。这会把我们的国家摧毁。我们不能结合在一起,我们不能成为朋友。当然不是在霎哈嘉瑜伽,我必须要说,这问题已经好好的解决了。若你看看就算在基督的年代,祂与祂的门徒也有问题。特别是某些与彼得有关的事情,他就是那位说撒旦将会遇见你的人。我想人们已经跌入撒旦的力量中。他说他把很多人的撒旦恶魔清除,放进猪里面。这是事实,撒旦的力量正强而有力地运作。我们越发展对灵性的安全感,它们便越发展得好。撒旦的力量在西方和在东方是以不同的形相出现。我想告诉你们怎样小心地去找出在西方的撒旦力量。

你未必受到它影响,因为你是已得自觉的灵,但你必须对抗它。例如种族主义,种族主义仍然非常强大,非常非常之强大。你必须藉由与另一种族的人通婚以对抗种族主义。但我仍对一个黑人与一个白人配婚感到困难,那是没有可能的境况。若我真的尝试这样做,我也不知道甚么事情会发生。

我必须告诉你,我们曾经有过这样的婚姻。一个白种的法国女士与一个黑人配婚。不是那个法国女士好支配人,而是那个黑人。所以我很惊讶,你知道吗,怎会这样的?所以我想原因是他想报复,或许是暂时的。首先巨大的爱心和情感必须在人们之间滋长。这种颜色是那么深入皮肤里,与内在的爱毫无关系,是那么深入皮肤。感谢天,在我的国家,你可以有肤色很黑的妻子,而丈夫的肤色可以很浅,或是相反的情况。他们从不以这个角度来看事情,我想在这个国家,这种情况并不存在。

但我们有另一种情况出现,你看,这是一种典型的人类问题,就是来自自我的歧视。我必须要说,基督曾经尝试对抗你们的自我。祂在一个非常谦卑的家庭出生,祂并非一位白色肤色的人,不是。以你们的语言,祂的皮肤是褐色的,但以印度语来说,他是黑皮肤的。但当说到灵性,你只看到开悟的那一位,你看不到他们拥有甚么的颜色,甚么肤色。那是非常、非常的表面的。我视这为西式生活必须征服的其中一个敌人,物质主义是另一个。我视反对基督最差劲要算是不道德。不道德却广受西方社会接受,各式各样的不道德行为都被接受。就如他们所说,所有不道德的人若把选票投向某人,他就成为美国总统。好吧,没有甚么关系了,容许各种不道德行为,这是绝对违反基督的。人们不明白不道德会带领他们到达我也不知道该怎样称呼的国度,因为那里甚至比畜性的国度还要差。他们是那么不道德,他们聆听如弗罗伊德那样的人的说话,就像他们是没有脑袋,没有灵魂,去注意这样的人。只有来到霎哈嘉瑜伽之后,你才可以拥有像基督那样模范的人生。无论是甚么,都已经过去、结束和完蛋了。

今天你是已得自觉的灵,道德是你的力量。忘记过去吧。我可以肯定,若你过着非常、非常道德的生活,你可以令很多很多人来到霎哈嘉瑜伽的旗帜之下。同样,另一个非常差劲的敌人是愤怒。他们很自豪,他们会说..「我现在很愤怒,你知道吗,我是非常愤怒。」他们不会因此感到羞愧,仍继续说..「我非常愤怒。」好像说「我很愤怒」是没有错的。他们说..「我憎恨你。」我的意思是你可以想象任何印度的语言,若他们用憎恨这个字,代表我正在犯罪。所有这种侵略性是来自愤怒。若某人想发怒,他应该对自己发怒,最好还是摆脱愤怒。你可以拉扯你的头发,你可以咬你自己,你可以用枕头打自己,这些可能都是最佳去除愤怒的途径。看看自己为甚么愤怒?有时是绝对毫无用处的,有时是没有意义的,有时是绝对疯狂、愚蠢的。但直至你停止说..「我非常愤怒。」就是这样,就是这个时候你才意识到你正在完全的下跌。

基督并没有谈及所有精微的东西,我却曾经向你谈及,因为是留给我说的。没有得到自觉,你又怎能谈论精微的东西?你不能。

上次我告诉你有关生命生量,那是甚么,那象征甚么以及你可以怎样得到我们称为Tanmatra的精微能量。光元素—Tejas,水元素—Jala,以及火元素—Prithvi。但我却没有告诉你一个非常特别的元素,以英语来说,你们称它为以太(ether)。以太是被另一种Tanmatra所管理的元素,我们称它为Akash,特别在今天,因为是基督牺牲了祂的生命,开启了我们的额轮,令我们到达了Akash这个状态。没有祂是不可能达至的。我们可以如常沟通,像我们可以与别人交谈,我们可以说话,我们也可以用手指来表达自己,用手去沟通,但若要与生命能量沟通,你必须拥有生命能量,否则你不能感觉另一个人。若你处于额轮,代表你在思维层次,绝对的思维层次,那么你的生命能量也在缩小,意思是你不知道他们真正在说甚么。你没有能力评价你的生命能量,因为这些生命能量是在思维层面。

他们说..「母亲,我们问过生命能量。」我说..「真的吗?」若你没有生命能量,你又怎能询问生命能量呢?这是非常普通的事情,我们询问生命能量,我们想从生命能量找出答案,那是不可能的。因为你只在思维层面。基督所做的是把你带离思维层面,那是最困难的。我感到很惊讶,那些跟随基督教的人却是处于最差的思维层次。他们绝对是处于思维层次。他们就像......我不知道该怎样称呼他们。就像德里的雾一样,你不能横越它。这是基督打破的。我们向祂该负多少责任,祂清除了人类升进的最大障碍,就是打破了这个额轮,这个在我们内里的思维存有(mental being)。我们像疯子一样阅读,像疯子一样聆听别人,我们喜欢那些喂食我们思维存有的人。他们是那么多思绪,那么好争辩,不停的只想及自己的聪明才智。那么,你只需要说..「好吧,跪拜吧。」你不能与他们充满思维的行为对抗。那就是为甚么很思维取向的人需要敬拜基督。

这种思维上的谬误令人感到自己高人一等。「啊!无论我们做了些什么,有什么错呢?」他们不能纠正自己。因为除非你超越这个思维上的界线,你看不到自己,你不能内省,你看不到自己,你却看到其他人,「这些霎哈嘉瑜伽士是这样的,霎哈嘉瑜伽是这样的。」以及各种类似的事情,但你看不到自己,因为所有事情都是那么思维取向。这种思维取向必须藉由耶稣基督的帮助而得到完全的约束。祂在你脑海里也是思维,基督也是思维的,现在该怎样做?那个要打破人们思维取向的人也是思维,你令祂成为思维,就像一座石像。

所以,首先我们要告诉自己,不要想,不要想,不要想,不要想,四次。跟着你可以升上,这是非常重要的。在静坐中,你必须超越思维。感谢基督,祂是坐在额轮上,去完成这荒谬的思想存有。

我想人们或许必须停止阅读。就算是我的讲座,也变成思绪,该怎样做?我的意思是任何东西一进入他们脑袋,不知何故,都变成了思绪。跟着他们向我发问..「母亲,你是否这样说?你有没有...。」我说..「我这样说是要令你无思无虑,只想吓倒你,不是要你坐下来分析,不是这样。我这样说后,你变得绝对的震惊和被吓倒。」所以对你们全部人来说,最好是变得无思无虑,这是基督的祝福,这是祂为你们完成的。我可以肯定,若你能成就到,不要把注意力放在别人身上,不要作出反应,只是不要有反应。他们对看到的任何事物,都作出反应。有甚么需要这样呢?这样做有甚么用呢?你想对这种反应做些什么呢?这种反应什么也不是,只能在你脑海里制造了思潮上的涟漪?我已经告诉了你数百万次,在这个崇拜之后,你必须变得无思无虑。

若这样的情况发生,我视我们已经成就了很多。这是基督赐予我们的最大的祝福,你必须真的很享受这祝福。只有在你内在的Akash Tatwa在工作,它是怎样运作的?藉由你的注意力,你们都知道,它是与我一起工作。我以我的注意力成就了很多事情。是怎样成就的?只要我的注意力变得无思无虑,只要无思无虑,它自然成就到。但若你常常把注意力放在思绪上,不停的思考,它便不会做它应该要做的工作。只要你是无思无虑,你的注意力便能成就非凡的事情,否则便不能。

所以必须从你自己那处升起,跟着从别人处升至谦虚这更高层次。在那里,你与天空沟通,我们可以称它为Tanmatra,或是本质,或是以太的精华。以太令我们可以拥有电视,拥有电话,否则,这将会是奇迹。但以这个Tanmatra,只要坐下,你便可以做这工作,它在运作,只用注意力运作,我是知道的,你亦知道。你不需要请求我把注意放在某处,你只要放注意力,它自会起作用。这是你得到非常重要的东西,我视这是你没有不妥当首先取得的东西。你们开始从土元素显现,跟着是火元素,再跟着是Jala(水)元素,跟着我们来到Tejas(光),我们的脸孔变得闪亮。最后,我们处于无思虑的知觉状态,藉此我们的注意力变得绝对的自由去做一些特别的工作。但若你仍然不停的思考,注意力便被迫要忙碌,你知道,非常忙碌,你不需要问我..「母亲,请放注意力。」你也可以放注意力,你自己也可以成就到。

在这注意力下,你不感到你得到甚么,你立足在何处,你穿着些甚么,其他人在做着些甚么,不,甚么也不是。你与自己合而为一。这是一个充满幽默的人生。那么多幽默,那么多喜乐,那么多快乐,你不再关心所有一般人关心的事情。

现在,霎哈嘉瑜伽在那么多国家中有成就。我因你们而感到自豪,非常自豪。现在霎哈嘉瑜伽也到达非洲的国家。对我来说,这是极大的满足。你们全部也可以做到,你们也可以成就到。唯一要做的只是变成无思无虑的知觉状态,就如基督的祝福的一样。若它成就到,你会绝对的享受自己。

愿神祝福你们。

Translation from Hindi:

The fact is that this English language has been imposed on us for the past three hundred years. I have never studied the English language. Never! Even in school there was a small book, and in the Medical College, no one taught English as a language. My father used to say, “It is such an easy language and there are so few words in it, that there is no need to study it.” And he admitted us into a Marathi medium school. And he used to advise us, “Learn Marathi and Sanskrit language”. So I did not study Sanskrit language and as for Hindi, I never ever studied Hindi language. No question about that! Didn’t learn in school or in college Didn’t learn hindi language anywhere! But there is one good quality in Me, which I must tell you about, that whenever I speak in Hindi, I can speak only in Hindi; and when I speak Marathi I can speak only in Marathi language, and when I speak in English, I can speak only English. It is very difficult for Me to translate from one to the other. That is why I cannot mix them up.

Each of these three languages is different from the others. Now no one will believe that I have not studied Hindi language. But because of My interest in reading, interest in reading good Hindi books, I learnt the Hindi language. But in the beginning My Hindi speaking had a lot of words and influence from Sanskrit. Because Maharastrians speak like that only. They don’t know day-to-day Hindi language. When they speak Hindi more than half of the words will be Sanskrit and the rest will be Marathi. You understand? This is the condition.

What I have understood from all this is, that even language comes as a gift of God. Like you have a gift in music and arts, in the same way, aptitude for languages is also a blessing. And by that, one can master many languages. But the Hindi speaking people cannot learn any other language. The reason for this is – for example the English people also, they cannot learn any other language. And even if they learn it, they will not be fluent. The reason is that everyone can speak English, so there is no interest for them in learning any other language. Now the Hindi speaking people have this problem that they just cannot speak any other language.

I will never insist that you must learn Marathi, because Marathi language is very complicated. It’s very difficult. Only Maharashtrians can understand it. And it has so much merriment and so many jokes. There is nothing indecent in that language. There is not even a bit of filth or indecency in it. It is such a profound and expressive language that for Sahaja Yoga there is no other language that is more appropriate than Marathi. Because only in Marathi a description of  Kundalini was written. Whatever has been written by saints and sages, has been written in Marathi language. And if you learn Marathi, you can learn any other language. There is no doubt in this. But Maharashtrians will not learn any other language. They are very obstinate.

I asked someone, “Just read this Hindi book”. He read a little bit, and put it down. I asked him: “Why?” and he said, “It is full of rubbish! Only nonsense is written, I don’t want to read it!” Because Marathi is such a clean language with such pure thoughts, that after reading... After reading Gita, you cannot read wayside books of dirt and filth. You will not understand them! So if some of you start learning Marathi, it will be a good thing. But it is a very difficult language to master. There are a lot of synonyms in Marathi language.

The reason I am telling you this today is that even after coming to Maharashtra I have to speak in Hindi, because you do not understand Marathi. In Pune I speak in Marathi only. But in Mumbai I have to speak in Hindi. So those who like to learn languages, should learn Marathi. It is a language to learn. And it is such a wonderful language that our Namdeva who was a saint, a very big, a very great saint, was called by Guru Nanak and told to learn Punjabi language and write his poetry in Punjabi. And Namdevji wrote such a thick book, in Punjabi language.

I too was able to speak in Punjabi when I lived in Punjab. If you can learn Marathi, then, except Tamil language, you can learn any other language. Maybe you will be able to learn a few Tamil words It’s such a  situation, that in this country there are fourteen official languages – we have, you will be surprised, fourteen official languages in this country. So I will say this that if you learn Marathi, you will manage to learn at least 8-9 of these fourteen languages. Now one more thing which is wonderful!

The Bible has been translated, directly from Hebrew language directly in purity, in Marathi language. In this area, there was a lady called Rama Devi, very intelligent and noble. All the writings in the Bible, she made a translation of them – of all the Bible writings – and she did it in Marathi language. In that she has used Marathi names, like for John she has used the name Yohan, and for Matthews she has used Matthai. So the Bible that I have read was in Marathi, and that is why, many times there is confusion. She has written everything very clearly and distinctly and she has written it in all its purity. And she has written in it that when Christ went to a wedding He transformed water into the juice of grapes. This is a fundamental point that she has written in Marathi.

The second amazing thing is that about the childhood of Christ and about boyhood of Christ I have not read any poem in English language. I don’t know, have you ever heard a poetry piece about the description of Christ’s childhood? I have never heard one. But in Marathi we have many. Now, just yesterday they sang beautifully, “Baala vadana tava baghuni Krista”. After seeing your small child’s face – after seeing your face, your child like face – “Baal Vadana” – all my fears run away. So all this part is missing in the Western languages. I think that the childhood themes are not there. We have about Krishna, about Rama, when they were children, how they used to walk, how they used to talk, how they used to put their finger in the mouth. Every little, little thing is described so beautifully about children. And that is how I think, Indians cannot think of killing their children at all. I mean it’s an impossible situation. Even in Hindi language, in Marathi language, we have such beautiful descriptions of these incarnations as children.

Then the third thing, which is surprising, is that all their romance is before the marriage. After marriage there is no romance left! Third thing is that there is no romance described after marriage. All before marriage. It is the other way around in Indian languages: all the romance comes when you are married  – very sweet, sweet things. I was surprised – I asked somebody to find out one English book where they have described the romance of the married couple. None! Finished! All the romance is over. Once you are married it is finished. Then what do you do? You quarrel, you fight, you go to the courts, take a divorce. That description is not there. And this is the significant thing that on us (Indians) there is a very big blessing of our Indian culture, very big! Please, remove that. Someone can come and remove it.

So I have read the translation of the Bible in Marathi. And whatever is written there, has great depth. I feel that English language has changed its essential nature. And even with regard to Christ, His sacred identity and spiritual significance has been preserved in the Marathi Bible. This is not there in the Hindi translation, nor is it there in the English version.

The third thing is that the Maharashtrians have high self esteem. In Rajasthan also, the people from Mewar are very self esteemed. They would not learn anything from the British. If the English tried to teach them they would say, “Leave it. No need. We have seen many like you”. But in the North of India I have seen that they are greatly impressed by the English. Wearing good suits, wearing ties, boots, commanding and ordering others. It’s not so in Maharashtra. To get a Maharashtrian wear a suit is the most difficult thing! They wear dhotis. Even educated people wear only dhotis. You can see that Tilak, who was such a great leader in the country, or we had Ranade (great leader) or Agarkar (great leader), all of them – no one wore suits and boots. No one used to wear tie or anything. Of course, if they are in government jobs, that is a different matter.

But here, even to be employed in a government job was considered below ones’ dignity and status. In Maharashtra, you must be knowing, that many times it has been written, it has been written many times, “Why don’t you take a government job?”. And they would mention three-four names of government officials as an example that they were doing well. But there is no honor and glory in a government job. Not at all! My father used to say that working for someone was inferior. Better to have your own profession. And a government job is the lowest form of employment. It destroys a person’s character. And I’ve seen this is very true. Now, if someone gets into the IAS (Indian Administrative Service), then finished. His value goes up in the marriage market – 30 lakhs, 35 lakhs. An IAS Officer in North India is considered a big man. Here it’s not so.

But here, if a man is educated, if he is a scholar, then he is appreciated; and most of all if he is spiritually sound. This is a very great difference. And that is why in the early days in Delhi, I used to wonder what will these people understand? But it is most amazing, that in Delhi, Sahaja Yoga has spread so wide; in Lucknow also. I just cannot believe! With whose blessings has it happened? These people were so badly servile to the British. What has happened to them now? How did they get transformed? I feel that where Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, made their divine abodes, there reside their blessings. There is no other explanation. Especially Lucknow, which was a place of indulgence – eat, drink and have fun – they were all indulgent and carefree...

I always hesitated as I did not know what to talk to such people. All their relationships, discussions, I just couldn’t understand. I was coming from Maharashtra and just couldn’t understand their way of life. Making fun of daughter-in-law or making fun of sister-in-law, it never made sense to me! And now I perceive there the blessings of Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, the poetry of Kabir, the blessings of Nanak Sahib. Oh! These people of Punjab – I studied in Punjab, and I felt that in the brains of these people of Punjab, Sahaja Yoga will never enter! And now I was amazed! I am very amazed! So much bhakti and so much bliss and joy. How did they attain this? There were no big public programs there, nor did anyone give big lectures. How did all this happen? Now in Maharashtra I really worked hard Oh my God! So many villages and hamlets I visited and worked very hard. But in Maharashtra it did not spread so much. The quality I found in North India it is not in Maharashtra. It is really surprising. I thought, all My efforts in Maharashtra will go in vain. On the contrary they got after Me!

So, I discovered one thing, that there are a lot of false gurus there! So many gurus! Everyone has a personal guru; each home has a guru; It was overrun with gurus! Even in the Panchaang (astrological calendar) even there, every guru’s name, date of birth, place etc. is recorded! Oh My God – all completely useless people. Of course there were a few genuine gurus also but very few. Very few. The others, such useless gurus, are either interested in money or interested in women! This large land of Maharashtra, such a sacred land, has been blessed by the different aspects of the Devi Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali and Adi Shakti – all of them have place in this Mahashtra. And the eight Vinayakas and Mahavinayaka, are all sitting here. One thing is that these people are not immoral, they have no dirty thoughts, but they have no capability to understand what is dharma, They don’t have the capacity. They only know going to the temples, ringing the bells and running after gurus for salvation. They are too much ritualistic people. There is no other problem of immorality with them. But they are so steeped in ritualism that they are not able to come out of all these habits. I have given you the analysis of the situation, this way.

The foreigners from whom I had no expectations whatsoever – I used to feel what kind of people are these, they have no understanding of anything – and they have reached such heights. And the people of the North whom I never thought that they would come to Sahaja Yoga... I used to call Dilli (Delhi) as Billi(cat). My marriage took place in Delhi. My father also lived in Delhi. I had no hopes from North India. But, it is a very surprizing thing that today in Delhi and further North of Delhi, in Punjab,  in  U.P., all over, in Rajasthan, Sahaja Yoga has spread. But Maharashtra it is a misfortune. And because of it, your coming here is very important. Because of your chaitanya, a lot of awakening can take place here and people can feel it. By your coming here, your attention also comes to this place, and by that, in Mahashtra all the false gurus settled here – there are lots of them still... In Maharashtra there is a saying “Ucchal Bangdi Karle”. I cannot tell you the translation of this. The job of picking and throwing them out can be achieved only through your Chaitanya.

Especially today, when you are worshiping the pure personality of Christ, His purest life, you are offering respect to Him, I would definitely say that, that all these so many false gurus settled here – which Christ, if He was here, He would have whipped them with a hunter – all such false gurus would be compelled to pick up their wares and run away! And after running away, I don’t know where they will go. They have made a lot of money, and befooled many people. But there is also a kind of narrow-mindedness, a kind of foolishness in people here. Any guru comes they will prostate at his feet. There are a lot of “feet touching” devotees here! So this is one thing inside us: the capacity to get befouled! I don’t know from where it has come. Whoever comes and teaches anything, its our heritage: “Gurudev has come!”. It is due to this blind following that the spiritual culture of Maharashtra has been destroyed. And I would say that, today when you are worshipping the life of Christ, His simplicity, His purity, the weapon of His innocence, the power of Shri Ganesha, will definitely destroy these people, and in Maharashtra the spiritual awakening will take place as well.

Here also the people will achieve that spiritual treasure and Param Tattwa (Divine essence) which existed in so many saints here. There was no saint who did not mention about Kundalini. All the saints here talked about Kundalini. Saints, one greater than the other lived in this land. I think about those saints in this country, who have worked so hard here, and tried to awaken spirituality. Here, even I could not succeed. But I congratulate you for coming here. Your coming here will definitely put sense into these people. They will realise that they are just running after false gurus. I am telling you all this because many people suggested that, “Mother, instead of Ganapatiphule, You should have your program in our place”. But I said “No! You come here!” Because it is your duty that you bring about awakening within everybody.

Spiritual awakening in Maharashtra is imperative. So it is necesary for you to come here. And that too, here (Ganapatipule) – the place of Shri Jesus Christ – we honor it by our coming. He is very important here. I tell you., He will take the whip to whip all these false gurus and finish them off. But you must know that today we are here to worship and awaken His supreme divinity. And with His power, Maharashtra will become purified and holy. They do a lot of worshipping of Ganesha, they worship Ganesha a lot. But who is Shri Ganesha, what does He stand for – all this they do not know. I don’t understand this. They are so entangled in this mess; and to release them it is necessary for you to come here. To come every year, and worship and celebrate the birthday of Christ is a great undertaking. My unending blessings to all of you.
