Yes, I was seeking in quite an intense way. I was reading about all different kinds of religions, and I'd say I was a pretty desperate seeker. I was a very bad insomniac; I hadn't slept very much for two years. I was so tense.

My husband-to-be was living in the flat above, though I didn't know him then. He'd been telling all his friends about Sahaja Yoga and expecting them to be as enthusiastic as he was, but of course, he hadn't had much of a response. So when he came to telling me about it, he was very laid-back and didn't tell me much. He didn't show me Shri Mataji's photograph, but he described something within us through which we could feel our own inner state, and also that it was collective and we could feel the state of other people. Not only that, but we could actually put that right. I remember thinking, "Well, what else is there? If that's true, then that's it."

He told me about the meetings in London at Caxton Hall where Shri Mataji would be. I didn't tell him I was going because I wanted to go to the meeting on my own; I didn't want him watching me and seeing my response. So I went without telling him.

I had a very intense, deep experience at that first meeting. I remember sitting there, waiting for Shri Mataji to come into the hall, and it was only then that I started to think, "What is this? Who is this person I'm waiting to see?" I felt this intense feeling of expectation. Suddenly, everybody rose to their feet, and Mother walked in. I remember she was much smaller than I expected; I suppose I imagined someone much bigger. I was right in the front row.

Shri Mataji talked for about an hour, quite a long talk, and I just remember feeling that everything she said made such sense. It was such common sense and just resonated so much in me. At the end of her talk, she said, "Right now, it's not about talking. It's about the experience. So, shut your eyes and put your hands out towards me." As soon as I did that, I felt this incredible pump up my spine. I didn't really know very much about Kundalini or anything, so I didn't know what to expect. I just knew something amazing had happened because it was a very definite experience.

Afterwards, Shri Mataji was in an incredibly motherly mood that night, which was very good for me because I had a difficult relationship with my own mother. She was just pouring out love, her arms open, moving amongst everybody. It was very biblical in a way. She didn't talk to me, but I remember having this feeling that I just wanted to touch any part of her, even her sari. Afterwards, I thought, "Gosh, I've never had that feeling about anybody before," and I recognized that instinct as something very special. It was the feeling that I'd never seen love like that before, a love that was just beyond, just special.

I went back and said, "I've met Shri Mataji, and I'm going to do it." He nearly went through the ceiling because he was so surprised; everybody else he'd been telling had not had that kind of reaction. So yes, I was seeking very much.
