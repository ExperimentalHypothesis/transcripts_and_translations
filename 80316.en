Should I tell you now about Krishna’s Sahaj Yoga. Krishna tried his Sahaja Yoga at the time when he was in Gokul and Vrindavan, he choose people who were married people, sanctified, holy married couples, you know them, they are Gop and Gopis living in Gokul and Vrindavan, very simple people leading a very simple Sahaj life.

And these people would not come like you, they were not intellectuals. They would not ask questions. Very simple village [people].

Some of you may be from there are here back again. So, Krishna tried very simple methods of Sahaja Yoga. What he did

Hindi: ‘ Aap ka saval ka jawab hai Gita par’ [Answer to your question from Gita]

When Radhaji, Radha, ‘Ra’ means Energy ‘Dha’ means ‘Dharaitesa’   means the one who sustains energy, she is the Mahalakshmi, she became Mary, she later on came as me ‘Radha’. Radha ji is Adi Shakti herself and Radha ji, whenever she used to go to the Yamuna River, she would vibrate the water. You have seen I am vibrating water for you. The vibrated water was carried by the Gopis on their head, as a child, Kirshna would throw a stone and from the back so that the vibrated water would fall on the Kundalini and would excite [unclear] then he did the ‘Gopal kala’  as  you know that how he played it with children, actually one American told me he was with Krishna and when  he got his realization he started describing  his experience and he didn’t know Krishna or anybody because he was from Toledo and he was saying a bright boy and there was  butter and all  that he describe to us, his name is Mr. Lord Joshep, Mr. Josheph Lord, he is an engineer  now in Toledo , he told me that he saw  himself with so many young boys , and there was a bright one with dark complexion and how he broke a matka and all those things he told me of course in his own way in  American way he told me that  it was hanging thru a net .

Hindi: ‘kheecha thaa  usko Net’ [ pull it thru a sting which is referred as net]

and there was an earthen pot which was broken, so what Krishna did was to get the small children together of his age and he made them sit one after another and standing on top of the head means his feet were touching you see their Sahasrara and that is how he wanted to awaken their Kundalini, now I can put my hand on your Sahasrara you don’t mind,   But that time he tried this trick , he used to put awaken the Kundalini thru the Sahasrara by standing on top of them, and then he broke that earthen pot ‘matka’ thru which the vibrated  things fell on them and they got realization, its Baptism,  it simple Baptism,  he did it in a very childlike manner.

Then Raas, he played Raas, ‘Ra’ is energy again ‘sa’ means ‘sahit’ with energy. He did ask them to hold their hands, now if we hold our hand  you can feel my vibrations passing through, and he used to make them hold their hands and pass his vibrations thru them  and that’s how  he tried to awaken their Kundalini, there are so many ways in all childlike plays, when he found that their Nabhi chakra was caught ,  what he used to do ,is to commit some sort of a mischief so mother would get very angry  ‘Yashoda’ , would get very angry and tie all of them together with her sari around a pillar and with that thing he used to pass his Nabhi chakra on  to everyone, everybody tied a the Nabhi chakra and the Solar plexus used to get excited because of his Solar plexus. So in all his child like play as you think is a very simple thing,  Is not, it is all Sahaj, he played with the Gop and Gopis and that’s how he did  It ,Today is the day when we can have a pandal, you are sitting before me with your hands like this, but it’s a very difficult thing to get such  people around and make them sit in those days , so he tried all these beautiful tricks, they say that when he was about  4 years of age the ladies had gone for bath and he  hid their clothes , many people are using , you see there was one man making women naked and men naked and they dance, So he says that ’I am Krishna, I am Shri Krishna that’s what I am doing ’,  So I went and asked him ‘at what age Krishna did it?’  at the age of 4 yrs, at the age of 4 years any child doesn’t understand what is sex, is a child, he doesn’t understand about sex, he was a child if he did not care for the chastity of women , or the  ‘Lajja’ of the women then why did he supply saris to Draupadi?

Tulsidas has described it very beautifully, he says, when she said Krishna she would not say ‘Kri’ she said ’Kri’, you see because if you hold like this Sari , said ‘Kri’,  but then she thought it’s not working, [unclear] she said ‘Krishna’, when she dropped then he Tulsidas has described moment beautifully is

Hindi  : ‘Dwarika mei shor gayo shor bhayo bhari , Shankh chakra, Gadha, Padma, Garuda lalye sidhari’ everything he brought it around to save the chastity of his sister Why?

If he had no sense of chastity, in every event of his life, it’s Sahaj. So those who say that ‘I am like a Krishna’ they must understand, all, everything is Sahaj, 16000 wife is nothing but 16 petals and the 1000 nerves here, so 16000 wives is 16000 energies were created by him  and these women you know were under the domination of King and they had no place in life, so he brought them down and put those 16000 energies  through [that], Now I need 16000 children, can I have them?

This is all Sahaj Yoga all his life is nothing but Sahaj.

Hindi  : ‘Aya Maza’? [Did you Enjoy?]

Hindi  : Ab aya na samaz me Krishna ko? [Now you got to know Krishna?]

Hindi  : Aap to haath to aise karke baitho kam se kam bete, Par ho jao [ Keep your hands like this  Son, you will get your Self realization]

Seeker :  It’s my first lecture.

So, it’s all right, no,  no there is no lecture needed at all.

Even by seeing me the Kundalini rises, at my feet it rises, lecture is only your mental feel, of course with my lecture maybe you get vibrate. Alright?

But main thing is you must get realization; you can get it just like that. Some people just entering inside get it, depends on , I have  told you two instances of a very well-known people in India who have got it just like that and they have got it and they have never lost it and they have risen also very high in life, so should we get into meditation now for about , let us try for about 15-20 minutes  well and good and if it doesn’t work out also don’t get disappointed, there are so many ways of working it out, take out your socks because I am sorry its cold  because you have to take out your socks .
