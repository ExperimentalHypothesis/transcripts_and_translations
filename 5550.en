Devi Puja
Pune (India)
Talk Language: Marathi | Translation (Marathi to English) - VERIFIED

Now as all Sahaja Yogis have assembled here,therefore it is a ‘hitguja’ (commune or sharing in a spitual way) and not a speech. The word ‘hitguja’ in Marathi language is so beautiful as it means whatever is beneficial for you or your atma is to be shared. and as it used to be said in early days ‘Satyam Vadet,Priyam Vadet’ (Speak truth, speak what is liked). Now how to blend these two? If you speak the truth it is not liked and if you wish to speak what is liked, it may not necessarily be true. If you want to blend these, it is a difficult task.Lord Shri Krishna found a solution to this and said, “Satyam Vadet, Hitam Vadet and Priyam Vadet” means that which is beneficial for the atma,‘Hita’ means Spirit contentment.Even if it is unpleasant, at the end it becomes pleasant and it is the truth. Imagine if tomorrow someone comes to Mr. Rajwade and he asks if some specific person is hiding here (taken refuge)? and if the person is wielding a dagger in his hand what should Mr Rajwade tell him? ‘that he is hiding is the truth’.Should he tell that the person is hiding here? Or if he tells this truth will it be appropriate, will it be beneficial? This is the question one faces.So the first thing is that this is an unauthorized gesture. If the dagger holder demands the whereabouts of the other person, then who is he to ask? And who is he to ask you? This is an unauthorized gesture. Hence you are not bound to respond to any unauthorized gesture as it will not be beneficial. One needs to have the right.

It is similar in Sahaja Yoga. Even though I love you all absolutely and I heartily wish that all of you should be blessed by the Almighty in Sahaja Yoga and should enter the kingdom of Almighty.You have been given a big invitation, have been offered greatn hospitality, and have been invited with great affection.But in this also unauthorized gesture happens. Hence it is not necessary that the unauthorized person will benefit from Sahaja Yoga. You need to have some right, even on your Mother. We have already lost our rights. It is natural (Sahaja).‘Sah’ means with us.‘Ja’ means born with.These rights are born with us. The rights of this Yoga are born with us.But just as we lose our rights as a citizen when we enter an empire,similarly we have lost some rights. So they have to be established. It is my job to do this. As we saw in Pune yesterday,the Ganesha element (tatva) is very sad. It was not getting awakened at all. Now see!Virtue is the prasad form of Ganesha. Means it is Ganesha only who gives us virtue.The wealth of virtue that we have is in our Kundalini and that accumulation is all of Ganesha.That is, the understanding of the Ganesha element that we have is where that wealth is.So no matter how much virtue you have accumulated if the Ganesha element is not right. Now the Ganesha has been spoiled in this place. You know who has spoilt it.So the atmosphere is so contaminated,that even your goodness cannot be comprehended by Ganesha.

If you put milk in the dirt, even the swan doesn’t know how to separate the goodness of milk. This is the way it is. So you should completely oppose those who are contaminating the atmosphere. We have to oppose not only mentally but completely, that we do not want a who spoils our Ganesha element here. If you feel neutral about it, it is your fault. Yesterday I have awakened Ganesha with a lot of cajoling. That is, the Ganesha element is the last of all. This is a very tolerant element. It is very difficult to destroy it and it sits on the main root.It is also being damaged by them and all this is happening before your eyes.It doesn’t need any governance, it doesn’t need anyone.

If all Sahaja Yogis decide it will not take any time at all.The Ganesha element has deteriorated here in Pune. So see how big the assault it is on Sahaja Yoga. Then yesterday we awakened Ganesha in all of us by persuading and cajoling Ganesha. When He awakened, many people got their self realization. Now you will say, "We didn’t go there, Mataji. We opposed to him. We haven’t even seen his face, yet why is our Ganesha element deteriorating?" Whatever is in the well (environment)will surely come (affect you). So, the responsibility of the Ganesh element going bad here is on the Sahaja Yogis here, this is the first thing to be kept in mind. How to set it right? How to establish Ganesha? You should ask me all these things or these people know how to clean them. Ganesha should be invoked in every Sahaja Yogi. Not only this, but should be awakened and established. We really have some few people in whom Ganesha is fully awakened and it is by the Ganesha principle that we awaken the Kundalini. Because unless Ganesha gives permission, Kundalini will not rise up. Unless and until he allows kundalini will not rise up. The work of Kundalini will slow down where this element falls short. Even yesterday it's force was low. It needs the force of Ganesha principle. So, I would like to say to the Sahaja Yogis of Pune, that the element (principle) of Ganesha should be strengthened on our side. I will tell you how to do it because this is a beneficial communication (Hitguj). The first thing is that it is a vow of holiness.

So the defects that happen to Ganesha happens firstly from the eye. Ganesha has a direct relation with the eyes and this Ganesha element itself has become later on Christ element. So in the middle of it where the optic thalamus cross or optic nerves cross, at that place is the centre of agya chakra and the agnya chakra is the manifestation of the Ganesha element. It is a manifestation. So, if Ganesh element itself has gone bad, then it must be understood that some wrong has happened through our eyes. One must first know that the Ganesha element is made up of the earth element. As you know, Gauri had created Ganesha by removing grime from the body. That means, Ganesha is made by vibrating the whole earth element. The earth element is very sacred and it's (having) power is to absorb. No other element is so strong in absorbing.

Such is the earth element. Earth is my mother. She is your grandmother.So you have a strong dual relationship with her. She is your grandmother, she can pull out all your faults, and can imbibe the Ganesha element in you. For that, you have to fix your eyes first. Always keep your gaze on the ground.You keep your gaze on the greenary or always walk on the greenary. In the morning if you walk on the dew, it gives comfort peace to the eyes. But the eyes should always be down. Again eye movements should not be done too much. Every time something happens you should not divert your attention this or that way. So think about what it could be and then slowly turn your eyes and see. People who have a lot of eye movement adversely affect their Ganesha element. It is part of flirting when we feel compelled to look at every woman. If we don’t look initially then we keep on turning our head to have a glimpse. These are some dirty practices that have emerged of late.

When we were young, our brothers and others were warned to keep their eyes to the ground while walking. Even today people of those days are identified by the fact that they do not raise their necks and look here and there while walking. In the past such a person was called idiotic. What is this walking like an idiot looking here and there? The gaze should be kept down to the ground. We have the example of Lakshmana. Sita was his sister-in-law. Now we do banter and joke with our sister-in-law. Even while talking to her he used to look at her feet only. Never used to look up. So much respect he must have had.So the gaze should be at the feet. Do not look in the upward direction. If someone does speak and ask, then look up slowly with great respect and reverence. This movement of the eyes helps in Sahaja Yoga.

You know our people from London. How deplorable their condition has become. How awkward their position has become. As soon as a few of them came here, you were in so much trouble. There all are like this. I don’t understand why they need a guru. They have all the dirty knowledge that they will teach this man hundred times. So they don’t have this (Ganesh tatva). They have lost it completely.

Even then they have worked on their earth element and have improved their situation. Secondly, stand on the earth element and pour water on the feet, raise both hands towards the sky or even taking my name will also work. So the earth absorbs through the water. You will be surprised you will feel very relieved. Also lying on the earth, greeting her, apologizing to her, "Forgive us for touching you with our feet." With the awakening of the earth element, the Ganesha within us, which is the essence of the earth element, it is the principle of sustenance of the earth element meaning the complete flow on this earth it is all due to Shri Ganesha. And this contemplation which we call as meditation is the manifestation of Shri Ganesha. Unless we have the sustenance(dharana), nothing can happen.So nothing can happen without first worshiping Shri Ganesha.

All the eight Vinayakas (Ganesh occurrences) are in Maharashtra.How great this is! But even there, filth everywhere! Recently I had been to Ranjangaon Ganapati, the vibrations were very low! Very little though awakened last time.Went back again, apologized for everyone.I also become devotee for you, that ‘let it go, they don’t understand. You are very powerful.So please awaken in them. What to say about you? You are a very pure principle, but these people do not understand anything.They are still ignorant. So please forgive them.’

There are dirty songs from movies blaring in front of Him. Now what to say about this? This is unauthorised practice(tantrik type)To create filth before God.So the ghosts (bhoots) come there. Use those ghost(bhoots). Pretend to be a ascetic and say that we have renounced the world and then create filth. Behave in a manner that does not suit an ascetic. That means, from here, whatever divine element or essence (tatva) is there, that principle goes away.Once it goes, the ghosts arrive. In this way, ghosts establish their rule replacing the Almighty. So it should be noted that we have seen black shadows on my photos sometimes. Surprisingly,my ( Shri Mataji's) attention shifted from there! I am not there at all. Despite the photos.I mean, the photo depicts me in person, but a dark shadow creeps over it. The reason is that some unholy things happen in front of that photo or someone has accused me of something or something else.It happens with me too. Most of the time I am really good but suddenly I lose my attention. I simply cannot notice that. Means in spite of all my efforts to pay attention to a particular individual,I would not be able to connect. My attention will just drift away. People say, ‘He is such an important minister, Mataji, why don’t you consider!’ ‘But somehow, could not meet him. Which ever way, it doesn't not work out' "They are such important people, you should definitely meet them etc..etc." ‘It never could take place,somehow could not be aligned’. ‘I could not manage it by some or the other reason something will happen’ The Almighty’s attention is also very holy and a little bit impurity is tolerable.

If a person is very fond of cleanliness and you tell him to stand in the dirt, Will he stay? He won’t be fighting with that dirt. Will go away from there. No, not at all. Such is the purity of the Ganesh element. Even though it tries to tolerate a lot, still His attention withers away. So it is the special responsibility of the Sahaja Yogis here that they should establish the Ganesh element. This means that people purchase Ganesh Idol and install it at home for worshipping. But we cannot purchase the idol. Because the person from whom we purchased what mindset he had while making it, did he have vibrations, from where did he bring the soil? He took money for that, he sold the Almighty.How deplorable? Can you sell the Almighty? How can we purchase the idol? Can you purchase me? People just say Mataji we have installed Ganapati at home. Need to see the idol, and its chakras. Need to examine the formulation and there are few such idols, really very few. I have only one Ganapati idol. Only one.Once we had been to Sangli. One of my accomplished devotees made it with his own hands and that too is made of wood. And I suggested that it should be installed in cow dung. It's colour is like mud Such is the beautiful Ganapati. This is one Ganapati I have seen – He is so wise,he is so wise.It has such strong vibrations. Once, in London, a gentleman came to see me and he thought that he should first go upstairs and have the divine vision(darshan) of Ganapati. So he went upstairs and there he paid his respects to Ganapati.

But it had no vibrations. He was terrified and taken aback. ‘ Whats wrong with me? I was having such strong vibrations but after I came in front of the Ganapati there are no vibrations. What has happened?’ Eventually he started thinking what happened.So Ganapati also bestows wisdom on such people too. So he wisely realized ‘I have not yet paid my respects to Shri Mataji. So Ganapati did not appreciate this. Let me first go and pay my respects to Her.’ Because Ganapati does not need anything except Mother. He came down running and fell at my feet holding his ears. ‘Mataji, you were inside.Forgive me.’ And again went up and felt very strong vibrations. He also apologized to Him. Ganapati cannot think of even Lord Shiva without Mother. Cannot think at all. Knows only one principle – Mother and her power. That is why he is so great and is worshipped by all gods and goddesses. Shiva Shankar, whom we say stays till end and is present forever. He too worships Shri Ganesha. Then what to say about others like Bramhadev and Vishnu. Maharashtra is blessed by Him. We know what Ganapati is and we have Ganapati’s mention all the time and we also believe in Ganapati.

It is very rare to find a Maharashtrian (person who lives in Maharashtra) who does not know Ganapati.Hence Ganapati should be worshipped first properly and even I thought yesterday what should I tell Sahaja Yogis in Pune. Something new, special. So it this that purify your Ganesh (element), establish within yourself. Understand the Ganesh element. There was this gentleman from Sangli. His Ganesh Tatva (element) is very good. While his upper is a bit spoilt, his Ganesh element is very strong. I am very happy about it. Similarly we have our Dhumal Saheb. He stays in the village. Always connected to earth. So farmers have a tremendous inheritance that they always have Ganapati’s blessings.That is why I have started the work in villages first.

Because it will happen easily there – wherever there are Ganapati devotees, it will happen first there. They do not sit for worshipping Ganapati but the Ganapati in them is awakened. More artificial the life becomes, the lesser is the awareness. So the first thing is that we set our Ganapati right. What all we need to do, what spiritual practice we should follow, this all you ask our other Sahaja Yogis. But if I could awaken Ganapati for the London Sahaja Yogis,then it has to happen with you, no doubt about it. After this how much the powers increase and how much force Kundalini gains, is something to be seen. So, after paying obeisance to such Ganapati, I proceed to tell you further about Sahaja Yoga. You know what Sahaja Yoga is. You know a lot. All people here are Sahaja Yogis so I need not tell them.

Now there is a big question. The question was there even yesterday and it is there even today. Why does it happen so easily? But it is such a whimsical question.Now I speak through this mike. If there are any villagers here and if they have never seen a mike, they would wonder how this is possible that you speak there and it (sound) comes here. If any villager has not seen a light, if you call him inside the house and ask him to switch off the light he will just keep on blowing. ‘It is not blowing out, how to do it.’ Just like when you press the button here, and it gets blown out there, he will be wonderstruck that how does this happen? Press the button there and it is illuminated here. It is a similar stupid question. Really very stupid. As we know when the sun rises in the sky, then chlorophyll gets developed in the plants. Due to this it gets a green colour. Where is the sun? Thousands of miles away. The moment it comes in the sky, this event takes place. If I ask you to give a green colour to the leaves, you will not be able to do it. Means you can pour it on the outside but will not be able to impart colour completely from inside and outside. How colossal the sun must be as he colours every leaf in the nature. But we are not at all surprised nor there any appreciation.

In English this is termed as ‘taken for granted’ means this is bound to happen when the sun comes. How do the fruits grow in the world, overnight how do they happen? We do not wait for them. How do the trees grow up, nobody knows.There is no measure for this.How does the sun make it happen alone? How many types of powers his rays have. How the sun alone makes this happen, you see. Similarly if something is happening through me then something must be present in me too. At least this much can be guessed. On the contrary if you keep on saying how can this happen then what is this way (manner)? I call this a human way... way of thinking because God’s way (method) is different. I call this a human way (method).It’s like you see from the opposite side and say how did you hang upside down? All of this is humorous. You observe everywhere that how do we ask such questions when you can see it happening. If you wish to see Kundalini I will show you. Will show its vibrations, its ascent, will show it's rising up but still people will ask you such questions. Then what is to be done? How to argue with them? This is the question before Sahaja Yogis. ‘Shri Mataji, when they ask such questions, how to answer them?’ Think for a while that if they are little crazy, you can set them right. If they are absolutely crazy then you should leave them alone. You need not stress yourself for that. Why to become crazy like them? So be wise and say, ‘it’s ok, let’s see.’ and avoid. But it does not happen like that. A person feels that since he has got it, it must happen, whichever way it must be done. Then we cannot manage it. So first understand the simple alphabets and solve them. Pune has a lot of simple people. Lot of them. Most of them are simple.But the difficult ones speak more; the difficult ones want to be at the forefront. The difficult one would have his own way. ‘We especially came here.’ So why did you come? Is this important to mention this? ‘Mataji we came specially.’ Actually they came for some other thing but drifted this way. They do come with a purpose, but to emphasize they will say ‘We took effort to come.’ It is not that you took special effort to come here. But still they maintain that they came specially.

Hence I want to say that a person’s intellect is so superficial that there needs to be some way to pull that in. Now your attention is towards me. Say some one is arguing with you, he is speaking something. So how to make him silent? His attention which is roaming outside, how to bring it in? If you learn to explore this path then you could become an excellent Sahaja Yogi. If he starts speaking something, do not pay attention to it. Give him ‘Bandhan’ by hand or you can give it through your ‘chitta’ (awareness) and immediately focus on Kundalini. He is speaking on one side and you focus on Kundalini and it starts rising up because we have Kundalini in our gaze itself. Once we focus on the chitta – you are astride the chitta, really you are astride the chitta You just focus your attention on his Kundalini, don’t pay heed to what he says – as Kundalini starts rising you can see the chakras clearly. Where they are stuck, where it’s ok – this all comes through practice. Practise a little. Pay attention to everyone’s Kundalini and try to raise. When you are aboard a bus, or train, wherever you see people first see where the Kundalini is. Our London has a custom. To shake hands. It is terrible stuff. Means till they suck half a litre of your blood, they do not feel that they have shaken hands. This is how they ‘Shake’. Specially after drinking. But before drinking also they shake hands that is when I give them realization. When they shake hands, I give them awakening . Then they drink less. Slowly their drinking has reduced and it is in my fate that I have to shake hands standing with 500 people. This happens every third or fourth day. Wherever 500 people are going and my hand goes as well with them. Now this custom has emerged in a natural way. I will not be able to touch their kundalini without shaking hands with them. For a moment, a person pauses too. It’s over once the hand shake is done. So we should focus on his Kundalini and raise the Kundalini. Immediately we will get to know through practice where the Kundalini is stuck. Immediately invoke the deity there. There is a science to it. One must understand it. Our London has a good arrangement for these people. What is the mantra for each chakra that has been written down, what are their permutations combinations, what is wrong where and its whereabout, all this is extracted and all of it is written on paper and preserved in a folder by them. One folder is with these people.You can see it.Make a folder like that. That is in English, you get it done in Marathi. Learn all that and remember and when we need to do the task, it happens secretly. If you think that the person seems alright, if he has catch on 1-2 chakras then these could be resolved. However, you should give him realization. Do not speak too much after giving realization. He himself will feel that ‘We will come to meet you. How is everything.., this and that?" Move it very slowly because normally people have inquisitive mind. If you suddenly approach them, they will shy away. If you want to take away something from someone, how smoothly we extract it. We need to extract it the same way – Because it is very subtle. If you try to tell them something special, they get apprehensive. So Sahaja Yogis should keep in mind that it is very subtle and delicate work. The human is spoiled so much that it has become very difficult to seek his permission before experimenting on him.

But you can give him awareness without his permission. He cannot, however, get his complete self realisation crossover(paar hone). For complete self realisation crossover (Paar hone), we need his consent. We cannot have that authority. Due to awakening , he may get good health. He will desire to reach to God. He will know God but there is a difference between becoming aware and getting complete self realization(complete union with divine) Even if Kundalini gets awakened , until it is fully awakened and gets completely settled it does not stabilize.

So to get him to this stage you need their consent. But if you have given him realization then it does not take time to reach this stage. And after they reach this stage, they can be made to get self realization. Still it must be understood that this is a very slow process. So you first consider such people who have faith in you and who respect you. Because even otherwise this is the thing that one should give to this world, nothing else. What is the use if you call someone for meals at your place? I have seen such people who have done so much for this world they felt that they have done this work or that work for the welfare of people; we have given so much money to the people. Have done so much good for them but people do not remember anything. If they again come in abject poverty to us, we will not entertain them at the doorstep. This is the mindset of people.

Over here, so many people have made sacrifices for the country. You know how great Lal Bahadur Shastri was. Have you seen any monument in his name? Can you see it anywhere in his name? And there is no controversy about this. People have written books about others; people informed that their characters were not good. But nobody can say such things about him (Shastriji). He has accomplished so much in such a little time but have you seen any monument in his name. Sometime ago, when I saw his portrait I was surprised that how come it was there. People may have doubt whether he was actually a prime minister or not. So such things happen. What could be the reason? It needs the association of the atma. As Awakening happens from inside, it becomes like a soul from within and that is why it is remembered. Gradually this may fade off. But still we keep it alive.Now we should focus on the ten people whom we want to give self realization. Note their names once you come home. Should confirm that these look good. They should be religious, should not try on very difficult people. Means drunkards, even they can get it but today this is not the time. Such people, who are religious, balanced, are positive, who are spiritually oriented and who are on this path should focus on such 8-10 people and take effort on them. You will be surprised that if you take 10 persons at least 8 will get connected to Divine. If each person facilitates self realization for even 10 persons, you can understand how many will get their self realization. Then you should continuously look after them and nurture them. What is their status, how are they, are they catching, why are they catching negativity? Once you become self realized, you understand negativity , not before that. Even if a person gets mad, he would not realize that he is affected by negativity. Even if he dies after getting mad, still he would not understand.

But Sahaja Yogis immediately understands that his agnya is affected. Catching Agnya means something has stuck to you. You start suffering. Then immediately the hands start moving, to remove the agnya affliction. Because you start suffering automatically. The reason for this is that when you become superhuman this is an important point, just note it down, it is important point as – when you became human, there are a lot of differences between you and the animal. The significant difference is that if you move the animal in the filth, it will not feel any different, It can tolerate anything. But if you do such thing to a human, he will not want that. He needs slippers and even if he is wearing slippers, he feels dirty. Would like to bathe. The human understands the concept of cleanliness. Similarly a human understands the cleanliness of atma. And after getting affected ‘I don’t want this catch, I need Sahaja Yoga. Remove this catch. And he suffers even if he gets affected slightly. And then the person removes it.

That suffering is not so clearly evident, you get an indication only. Just like a barometer gives an indication. That this person has got a catch at this place. Once you remove it, he is relieved as well as yourself. See how interesting it is. These people purchased kumkum (red powder) from the market. I did not know what kumkum this was. It started burning the moment I applied it on my forehead. I asked them to first remove it. It did not strike me as it was very crowded, I did not realize first when I was asked to touch it. Again my attention got attracted there. Then I took the kumkum and vibrated it. I told Mr. Rajwade that ‘get the Kumkum from your place, it is good. The one you got last year was good.’ Such minute things are noticed. So everything gets vibrated. Vibration means Omkar only.This is the Pranav (the total form) of Omkar. Pranav means pulsation, the total holiness. This holiness is love that communicates, we become aware of everything. As we get connected to the computer and the computer tells, similarly this computer, created by the Almighty, tells us every minute detail.

We must understand from it. In the third stage, some people become very religious. Now the gentleman from yesterday revers Lord Mahadeva. And he has a catch on heart. How is this possible? Heart is the location of Mahadeva and Mahadeva is upset with him. "How can this happen?" People ask “ Mataji, we so ardently worshipped Lord Mahadeva , then how did we suffer from a heart attack?”. People say this does not fit. It’s not wrong, but there was no connection.

Now how can such a person, who has worshipped Mahadeva ask Mataji “Shri Mataji, are you the power of Lord Mahadeva?” So as a response, you will get vibrations on your hand. Because it is true. If you ask me a question, I would say yes, 'It is like that only. What to do now? I am what I am.How can I relinquish what I am?' If someone is some special being, does he feel proud about it? That person feels proud who does not have it. If someone has it, what is there to feel proud about? Now you have fingers, nose, you are humans – are you proud of it? My case is something similar. Means whatever I have is there. What can I do about it?

Now Mr. Pradhan is our old trustee, but he got affected. I told him yesterday not to go on fast on Mahashivaratri day. While he did ask me, he went on fast. One should not keep fast in front of me. I feel very sad. You trouble your mother when you fast. We should fast only on Narak Chaturdashi day. Means sleep for a long time, do not take bath. That’s the day when the door to hell opens. If on that day you get up at 4 o’clock and eat, the demons barge in. Few things are so wrongly established, so wrongly , that it is very surprising. Now another case, regarding Ganapati. This person had issue with his prostrate and he used to fast on Ganesh Chaturthi day. He visited me on Chaturthi and he had prostrate trouble. I could not understand why this person, a Ganapati personified, had prostrate issue. Because Ganapati controls prostrate etc..See how Sahaja Yoga is? The day of Chaturthi, same day he did fast and came to me on the same day. The whole situation was in the fore. This is the sign of Sahaja Yoga.

My Prasad is that of Chana (kind of pulse), I took some and said take this Prasad. He would not say anything. But the person standing next to him said, ‘Mataji, today he is on fast’. I said, ‘What is the fast for?’ He said ‘It’s Chaturthi today.’ I said ‘Is that so? If a son is born in your house, will you fast on that day? What sort of wisdom is this?’ To fast on the day of someone’s birth is a concept I could never understand till date. If a child is born in your house, will you follow a period of abstention? That is why it has been mentioned that one should not keep fasts. Because the principle of fasting is so faulty, it has gone so wrong; I don’t understand what to tell these people. I am not saying you should just keep on eating. The people who fast are obsessed with eating, I am troubled so much with this.

They fast for namesake but their entire attention is on eating. Means 'What is menu today?’ is their first question in the morning even before they bow to Ganapati. The reason is that we are fasting today. They need to create great commotion in the house. To fast means there has to be some special menu. Bring this, must eat this. It should happen this way, must eat these things. Means, what is all this? If fasting is suggested by somebody, I don’t know if it was indeed prescribed it was suggested only for the reason that you should be in the proximity of the Almighty. There should be no emphasis on eating. If you start emphasizing on eating then your proximity with the Almighty.. Now we have to go for meals, have to go there, now this is our program, etc... these thoughts will come in your mind.

So to fast on that day means ‘To be completely in the proximity of the Divine.’ Actually this fasting.‘Upavas’(fasting) means having close companionship of the Almighty’. This is the real meaning as given in Sanskrit. And they wrongly understoodth at one should fast. But there is another interesting word ‘Upasana'. To perform upasana (to worship) means ‘upas-na’ (fast-no) . So this fasting should be avoided to some extent. But the dialogue continues – Today it is Ekadashi, so what should be brought? Then it needs this thing, needs grated fried potato, want this, need khichadi (made of sago), need peanuts, need shingade (chestnut).Now Shingades have become costly today. Why, because it is Ekadashi. The essence of human is so important, so great, so superior, made with such great effort and where is it going, where are you taking it? The attention is to be placed at the Almighty’s feet and you are placing it on the peanuts. Are you going to get connected with God by eating peanuts? I don’t understand how this is acceptable to the human intellect. This religious fanaticism has given such adverse results that it has given rise to another extreme. Your kids will term you as mental cases.

In the second generation you will see kid saying ‘our parents are completely off their rockers (mad). The Brahmins have fleeced them and the fasts have killed them. They did this.’ Nobody will have faith in God. If you escape this then you may become an unbeliever. God is there. Not only that, his all encompassing power is doing all the work. No doubt about it. One must understand it, one must be come aware of it, like I said yesterday, and we enhance our contemplation with the help of Sahaja Yoga. Now what he says is right. We have quite a few such people who did not know the ABC of giving a speech. Just timid people. If they do speak, actually Goddess Saraswati flows through them. There was an eight year old girl. She started speaking so well.

In London there is a boy aged 8-10 years. He delivers such a beautiful discourse on Sahaja Yoga, people get surprised. How can one know so much? I can tell about my granddaughter. She must be around 5 years that time. They had gone to Ladakh. There was a Lama person sitting there. He was decked in his grand attire and my granddaughters were speaking in Hindi. So everyone paid respects by bowing at his feet. The moment her parents bowed down, she did not appreciate it as she herself was a great Sahaja Yogi So she stood in front of him and said, “Wearing this long gown and shaving your head does not let you become a realized soul, So why do you accept obeisance from others when you are not connected to God.” She said frankly, just like Kabir. Kabir has thrashed such matters so badly. One must read Kabir to get strength. He says that if by shaving your head you meet the Divine, then the goat and sheep get shaved every day, these must be close to God. He has thus reprimanded all such people, the people who wear long gowns and call themselves Sanyasis (hermits, saints).

Another granddaughter of mine, she is slightly elder to this girl.Once I was invited as a chief guest to a program of Raman Maharshi.There were quite a few well known Sanyasis sitting there. There was this gentleman sitting next to me. He is considered to be a very accomplished person. My granddaughter saw this and could not tolerate. She stood up and said "Granny, the person who is wearing a maxi and sitting next to you, drive him away as I am getting lot of heat.” and she straightway got up and said this and there were lot of Sahaja Yogis sitting there. They started laughing as they were also feeling the heat. The person looked around to see who is wearing a maxi. He did not realize that he was the object. So such power emanates from within that a person starts speaking only the truth, does not feel afraid. As he is standing on truth. Now look at the life of Christ.How pure it is! But a prostitute, people are throwing stones at her. What is His relation to the prostitute, He was Divinity personified. But when people started throwing stones at a woman, considering her as an evil person, a prostitute, he said that who so ever has not committed any sin should cast the stone and that too at me and everybody stopped where they were. ‘If you think that you have not committed any sin, you hurt her.’ Later on she became his great disciple. She was Mary Magdalene, His great devotee.But these people have started emulating her. I do not understand the human brain. The English brain is a notch superior. I asked them why people behave in such a stupid manner. They responded, Mary Magdalene was a prostitute and she got liberated hence we all became prostitutes.” They tell me like this, what should I say? “If she would not have become a prostitute, she would not have been liberated. Hence we are also following the same path.” Now what should be the response to this? That we are standing behind a donkey. We know it is a donkey. There are a lot of such idiotic things over there.

Even after being so educated and considering themselves as advanced people, I see only such donkeys. Now I have no hesitationto tell you that an eighty year old person writes a love letter to an eighteen year old girl.There may be one such idiot writing this, but it is flashed on the front page of the news paper. Columns after column everyday. My husband used to say, read this “geeta” after waking up in the morning. And the people diligently read this seriously. Means all of them must be stupid people. I don’t understand how they read such stuff? And this is very common out there.An eighty year old woman writes a love letter to a eighteen year old boy. Have you heard such thing anywhere? Means what is this matter? We have seen donkeys but even a donkey would feel ashamed. Why to say donkey. Donkey is quite a good animal. Sometimes I feel, that Christ rode over a donkey, don’t know if these people were those donkeys? Such filthy matters. These people who have come here are not as difficult as we see there. Eighty years old people, who do not have a common sense, no concept of elderliness, what we call as maturity is also not there, means what is this? What sort of advancement is this? Some of the questions that Sahajayogis are facing that I have told you just now.

Also some questions related to science are faced by them. Because people over here have started thinking that “we have become scientific etc...”. People who have become very scientific have also come here along with us. It is my wish that, of those, we should converse with a few of them and they should speak with us. You meet them, talk with them or if you have any questions just ask me , I will answer them, then you talk to them. This way you will get an idea as to where that thing called science has reached.

Shri Mataji asked "Has Gavin left?"

So now you could ask me questions.You could ask me any questions.Ask those questions related to the obstacles you face in Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yogis should pose questions. So that I can understand, what you problems are? What are your obstacles? Or if the question is how to explain people, you could ask me.Regarding Kundalini or about anything.

Now this person has asked about ”Jalandhar Yoga etc...” Listen to that. There is some confusion in this; you will be surprised if I tell you. The Jalandhar Bandha is part of the chakra and it means a knot. This knot completely opens up and then it secures Kundalini tightly this is the meaning. This deals with Nabhi Chakra. When Kundalini starts rising up suppose when anything starts climbing up, it is a difficult task, isn’t it?

Going downwards is easy, going up is difficult To raise the Kundalini up and to carry her away , the knot or tightness is formed by the chakras. The chakra tightens itself. So that the Kundalini that has risen up should not slip down Jalandhar Yoga is for this purpose. ‘Khecheri’ is also a similar concept. Having arrived at the Vishuddhi chakra, when the Kundalini starts rising further, that time Vishuddhi Chakra holds her and sustains her so that she should not slip down. That’s real Khechari. It happens. That time the tongue will get pulled inside for sure. As the complete awareness has gone inwards, it forms a knot. You don’t realize this. As it is very ‘sukshma’ (subtle,minute), you do not realize what all has happened inside. Only your awareness rushes towards Kundalini. Because you attention gets pulled inside. This is a very subtle event. Your awareness also becomes subtle. So these events happen inside us that time. Suppose this electricity starts from here and then how does it roam inside and become a loud speaker. It is similar to this. Means this is a subtle event happening inside. This all happens inside us. What is written here has a meaning. This is written by Shri Dnyaneshwar (a great saint). But what people interprete, that if we sit like this, it creates Jalandhar Bandha is incorrect. You cannot do it. It just happens. See the vast difference here. It is natural, happens inside. Now if I hold the hand like this, will it become a microphone? If you say ‘I became the governor’, will you become one? Does it happen like this? Will anyone believe it? At the most they will put you in an asylum. A person yells ‘I am the governor’ or even ride car while doing this. People will say ‘put all of them in the asylum.’ The authorities that are tied these things which are subtle and these authorities are subtle and they exercise these themselves. This cannot be done by you. That is why it is called Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is the very best. It is the most superior and hence it is a ‘Maha Yoga’(Great Yoga). Sahaja Yoga means everything. Nothing is unnatural in this. If you banish the thought that you are something then it makes sense. You only put on the switch. Rest all happens by itself. It is in built in the electricity that it has to flow this way. Once it is connected, there has to be light. If it goes through such circle, it has to become a mike. If it goes through that circle, it has to become a fan. This is the principle of electricity. Similarly Kundalini & the Sushumna Nadi within you and its mechanism etc.. situated in you, has its own associated principle and when Shri Dnyaneshwar explained how this principle functions “that we can do.” If you say that we can light a lamp by touching here, then the lights will certainly get on. They should try this and if once the light gets on then they can write in a book what how painful the quest of Kundalini is. Means people will feel how cool it is. If these people have suffered so much, how much it should be for us.

Now this gentleman, Krishnamurti he has written that, "My Kundalini is awakened". Means a self certification and because of that I felt as if a scorpion has bit me. I suffered a lot. I had blisters on my body. Felt very hot from inside, my head started spinning. My condition deteriorated. Then I asked people. They said your Kundalini is awakened.” Must have visited some guru. Must have tried some silly things and due to unauthorized gesture he got the whiplash from Shri Ganesha. He felt it on the sympathetic. So people like such books very much. Means a person is troubling oneself with all his might. If you have suffered so much why do you pursue it? Yesterday I told you that Kundalini is your Mother and how lovingly a mother looks after her kids. Just think why will she trouble you? Just think about it. So a person who has read such material would think that he is not awakened. Because according to that he should jump like frog or he should at least be bitten by a scorpion or he should feel the smell of bedbugs these are some matters given in the material.But one thing is true. When the Kundalini awakens, then we have some other experiences as well. But these experiences should not be taken seriously. Because if the Kundalini gets pushed more to the right side, you will see light. Don’t consider this as special. If you are right at the centre, you will not see anything. It is followed by fragrance.Because earth is your mother, her essence is fragrance. The earth is made up of fragrance. And as she is the mother, whenever you remember me, you will experience fragrance. Fragrance is the expression of my body. People experience different types of fragrances. Some say “Shri Mataji yesterday we experienced the copious fragrance of Guggul (deva-dhoop) in the room”. Actually this person is moving around like a God man. He cannot tolerate any fragrance. God loves fragrance. What sort of God man is this? He is dirt loving. How can he be the i ncarnation of God? So if a person experiences fragrance, a person should go beyond the fragrance itself. A person may get carried away by this. May see light as well. Everything is there. But when you start seeing light, there is no doubt that the agnya chakra has been opened. You will also see black spots in that light. Those are catches. They may be in you, someone else, or in the atmosphere. How to remove them? etc etc. the observation of the light first get the Kundalini stabilized what I mean to say is first reach Delhi and after reaching know what Delhi is.

So you understand it later, the types of lights, what happens due to this flame, all minute details – till you see the vibrations, see their circles, their movement- these you should see afterwards. If you see a little of this in the beginning and if you get engrossed in that, then you have lost it. Means this mind is like a horse, you should get astride it. If the horse knows that you wish to eat the grass on the way, then it takes you to the grass. But if he understands that you wish to reach your goal, then it will be fully in your control. But it should know that this person is a horse rider. He knows how to ride. But if the horse comes to know that you cannot ride a horse then it starts bothering you. You must be able to sit on that horse so that he becomes your friend, your carrier. So imagining your Chitta to be a horse, you should continuously tell it tersely that he needs to take you to your final goal, will not accept you taking me anywhere else.Then he will take you to the ultimate pride of place that is moksha. Now you can ask questions regarding obstacles that you will be facing. I earlier asked them but no questions were raised. If you have any can ask. Ask ask ... come little ahead and ask..

One Sahajayogi asked question that he sees bluish light in meditation.

Answer by Shri Mataji: No problem with it. Bluish light means our heart chakra has blue colour. In this if you can see little like smoke then its Vishuddhi chakra. (Inaudible portion). It's good no problem with that and that flame that is there is flame of Spirit(Atma) Can see that is also good but I am saying that you just become the Spirit. Beyond that if you just become the Spirit then you won't be able to see flame of Spirit. Intially you can see it. As like when we were coming inside we saw home of Mr. Rajawade now I have already came inside. Can I see home now from inside?

Sahajayogi: I cannot see anything Mataji.

Shri Mataji: That's why yours is good. Your Agya chakra is good. Now he has came inside you will say he cannot see anything. Whatever way we are should be seen. Many peoples have that we are sitting in vaikuntha and this and that that too in Columbia. In Columbia one women saw Vaikuntha And she got completely surrender and all that but I said now forget all this whatever has happened and if you can see light and all that; if you see me in five elements that is from right side or you may see from left side....But leaving this all behind you come (in center) because now you should sit on stage. Stage is ready for you. There is one thing about it. I will tell something about Nirvana. Because if you can understand one thing about it will be better. They also discuss about Nirvana. They say that Mataji we want mukti(liberation). Means they feel that we don't want any work and we don't want take birth again etc. etc... ideas they have. We should get such state that now we have got Nirvana Moksha (Liberation) Now I will tell different kinds of concepts of Moksha that are there Like initially God .... suppose one person want to open an office..In that he wants to manage different peoples. See now Mr. Rajwade sir want to establish this event hall, because he wants to establish set up to stay here. Then he will choose some peoples who can arrange for their stay Means if some people are coming here serve them food, buy vegetables, cook food etc. Then he will hire some officers who will work for him. That means they have been given Moksha..They don't have to do any other job. Either go on cooking vegetable or just serve them food. Means one work has been alloted to Indra though he is not from Devgana's As on five element there is one deity alloted to each of them and these deities alloted has been given Moksha. Then their disciples are alloted. They have been also given Moksha. They just have to do this duty.

Now you are Guests. This all organisation has been created for you. Then why do you want their position? So in this manner there are 5 Chiranjivis(group immortals) alloted. Means whole stage is ready. Now you should come on stage. But now you are saying that we don't want to act on stage I want to do make up. Why do you want do it? They already have peoples alloted there. Means as everything stage by stage got ready in that organisation those peoples are allocated now, then why are you going there? Now your state is at this point. From that some are on left side and some are right side Ganas are on left side and Gandharvas are on right side. In this manner everything is organised like this.

Now it's your time to enter and above that you should go on superconciuosness on this(right) side is collective subconcious and on this side(left) is collective supraconcious. Beyond that you have to reach to superconcious. This is Ganesha's abode There only Ganesha is residing. Only Ganapati can reside at (lotus) feet of Sadashiva and you have been created just like Ganesha. and reaching to that state many Ganesha's should be created So this state(condition) is different Ganesha don't want Moksha. Your work(role) is different and state(situation) is different if you understand this.Then (Shri) Mataji let always Sahajayoga happen in me and let it's work get done through me this you should desire and that's what you should enjoy. Like while swimming you jumps into water and starts swimming in same manner you should enjoy.

Shri Mataji again asked, "Is there any other question? "

One Sahajayogi asked that he can see image photograph of Shri Mataji during meditation. Is it ok??

Shri Mataji: Since you have seen photo many times you are seeing photo is not bad. But you should become one with photo What you see later also tell...I am also just a bubble....you don't know. I have just taken one form. This is just an illusion. When it will become threadbare or when something will happen cannot be predicted. Then what about me? So now certainly when we (I am)are sitting here in this form should be benefited completely. and whatever love and devotion you have about it(this incarnation) you will be blessed due to that. Not just this but infront of all Sahajayogis I have to accept it and say it that since all deities are within me if you have been humiliating or disrespectful towards me then all these deities will be angry.

Within them also four deities are very strict. Ganesha is very strict himself. Sahajayogis face sometimes his rap. After him you know Bhairavnath. I don't have to tell you about him. Third one is Hanumana and fourth one is Kartikeya or whom we call Christ. In this manner these very resounding four are sitting around on four sides and they are your elder brothers and they give you rap. All these deities are within me thats why you should please me. Now what should I say I have to tell it by myself and while telling this (I) have to become humble like human being. But what should I do it's just like this Thats why I have to make you aware that take care. It makes big trouble afterwards and then they cannot bear it. So be careful though I am very gentle these peoles are within me. You know about them it's difficult job and that is fixed. You cannot change them cannot compromise them. Whatever I convince them "Now be pleased...". but no.....No No means no.... They will indicate exactly...exactly..."Shree Mataji they have this they are talking unnecessarily..." However I ask them to "Forgive" but "No"... Unless and until that person gets corrected they will go on following him. Now for example there was a gentlemen called Madhu Dave. He is from America. Though now he is very good Sahajayogi. Now even I talk about him he will not feel bad because now he has accepted all this. So earlier he came from America but I didn't show anything to him that I know something or etc.... And Mr. Pradhan Sir he also didn't hurt him and was shown alot of respect to him. So when this Mr. Madhu Dave came here two three peoples said to me that this person looks little messy. They said when did hands towards him we felt dizzy. I said I know everything you don't worry. I will take him ahead. Immediately I said to him that You have started ashram over there in my name. So now show me it's brochure. Then in that brochure it was written to give vibrations 50 dollar and to give special vibrations 200 or more dollars... So I said its terrific now what should I say?? So I told him "Now you see you cannot take money like this. How much money have you given to me?" Means I travelled to America and everywhere with my own money Saheb(Sir CP) gave me all money And to stay there and food all I did with my own money Even hall booking and all that was done by moeny from Saheb(Sir C.P.) My relatives sent money. So by spending money from my own pocket I gave you realisation. So then now how can you earn money from this? Then he said how should I servive?

I said "Do whatever you want. There are many buisnesses." But you cannot money through this. Then he got very angry because he was caught up with badhas and he started talking ruthlessly. All sahajayogis were very angry and he was getting excited(more angry). At last our Modi who is little strict he stood up. Then he told him strictly "Now if you will talk a single word I will throw you down from up." Then he got little astonished and went down.

So he was having this thinking that if you are a Sahajayogi then you should listen even if someone is cursing your Mother. Even if someone is beating her then still you should see it because you are disciple of Christ. But if Christ Disciple would have said something about his Mother then his real form which is of Ekadasha Rudra would have come out. Thats why Christ never said that my Mother is Adishakti. So if he bear it then you will believe him. He would have never been patient with this. Thats why he never told that my Mother is Adishakti. So he said something like this and then he went to some Guru or someone There was some Guru. Now I forgot his name. He was in Kalikat or somewhere. He reached there. When that Guru arrived immediately he praised He said "How did you came back from there? What did you thought about her who is she? She is Verily(sakshat) Adishakti. I know it. And you disrespected her there ... (wording little unclear) And additionally he said praise to me and recorded and immediately sent with him. He didn't talk anything later just asked him to seek for forgiveness. Then he came to London.

Now I will tell you also (how he was) whiplashed. He came to Mumbai. He got fever. Due to which he could not meet me. Meet this person ..meet that person.. he couldn't reach to me. He just wasn't allowed to reach upto me. Later on he rang me up Then he said "Mataji, I want to talk with you littlebit. You see I brought tape(recording). Let me play a littlebit." Then he played that (recording)over telephone." I said,"Ok, Ok we will meet. So you come tomorrow. (He asked,)"What time?" I said,"10 o'clock." At 10 'o clock he could not get vechicle or motor nothing.. He reach to such a state that there was strike and he couldn't come. Then later on he ranged me up that I was not able to reach there now. So I said "What could be done it's Hanumana's work, ok!" "That Hanumana who is over there near by you, it's his work ok!" "Now what's is this your tail(to Shri Hanumana) now control it, let him come..." But invain no means no.. " So then I said " Atleast come to meet me at Airport I am going to London, no but even there he couldn't reach". Something happened may be his motor was failed. Then later on he wrote letter to me that "Mataji I couldn't understand this. I was so much desparate to meet but invain." Since then he has written letter three times. Day before yesterday again received letter. Now we will see afterwards. Whenever Hanumana will desire then only we will go. Now he is inviting many times that,"Now we will do like this or like that..." I said to him "Now you stop doing buisness of Sahajayoga and start your own buisness" Now he has become professor and he is doing job. So like this you get beaten up. This has to be understood. Likewise many Sahajayogis have faced such thrashes. There was one of our Sahajayogini in Mumbai. So when I was going to America I said to her, "Madam you see You were Disciple of that Guru he was having this Siddhi and etc.So after I leave; it will enter in you also." She said , "I don't want that Mataji." I said,"Oh ok." "So, then "Then you be vigilent." I said to her. After I left means I was just outside for three months not too long. Within that period that lady established great empire of Mataji. And holding stick in her hand she used to beat peoples. Will I be like this any time??? And she used to predict numbers for horse betting. This was Mataji's greatness glory(Mahatmya)?? Three three thousand peoples used to visit three three thousand...! She used to ask to give her sarees. Give me this give me that.... and so much money she extracted from peoples. She took alot of money from peoples. I went that day. I got to know but I don't know what should I write down in letter. Otherwise I will again forget, after coming back, What a respect I was shown. She took me over there and washed my feet with silver pots and this and that...etc.. And I found that all bhoots there. That you are so much glorious this that. She offered such a big garland to me to my photo. I just removed it within two minutes. I thought now how should I tell them. At last I asked her to come to home.

Then told her that "Now you have alot of knowledge so.." She said, "No Mother this is all your power.", then I said " Yes all is my power so you tell something about him the one who is sitting next to you. Tell about his past." That she couldn't understand.. thought of it. She said "What this has happened Mataji? Have you taken back my all powers?" says so and she came to my feet. I said "If it was your power it would have been above my head. This was some dirty power which has come to you which I told you earlier." Then she started saying that Kumkum is coming out of my hand rice is coming out of my hand. I said, "Ok, then take out Kumkum infront of me." What Kumkum and what anything ... her hands started becoming like this... I said "Ok now say in front of me that, I want Param. Say."

She said and all that happened but this publicity craze cannot be detached. Then she was so big buptious. So many peoples used to visit her. Earlier I said I should send her my photo then will see. Asked for photo .. so then we are so great. Now she is in mental assyalum. She is established over there. Now is this matter I haven't done anything. Once you have said me Mother I don't do anything.

In the same manner another overwise was behind me. He washaving great plight so his wife said "Mataji you give him work on your boat." So I said "Ok come we will see if you get some work on boat will be good." Not beacause is Sahajayogi but his wife was very Dharmik(religious) so if her husband gets job will be good so.. But he started doing corruption over there. Those peoples told me, "Mataji how is this man? He started corruption here and he is troubling us too." I said " You fire him out." I asked him "Why are you doing corruption over there?" He said "It all just happening over there. Its just like that." I said "But this will not be tolerated here." I said "Our Sir's(Sir CP) work place this will not be tolerated. He never did any corruption. If he was bribing I would not be live anymore. You are Sahajayogi that's why I send you there and you are doing such things there. You just leave from here now. Don't stay anymore here." He got angry over this. Where ever were our centres he went there and brain washed peoples there. Many peoples got spoilt also.

But once he met one lady she was very simple and I just gave her Realisation first time only but very wise one our Ms.Oak. Don't have some special education. Very wise women in household things. I said to her elderly sister. He met her and started telling to her that your Mataji is like this like that. All that is false and this is not truth not this not that bla bla..After listening all she said, "You see you tell me how many people you have cured? How many people you have given realisation? How many people life you have transformed? Due to Mataji in our home my husband's all addictions were cured. My daughters are settled nicely. Laxmi (auspicious wealth) settled in our home. Our diseases are cured and now we are in good condition. So now why should we listen to you? Who are you? You met us also at Mataji's place and I don't know such dirt is coming over there. I never want to see such faces." Since then he felt like slapped him. But still he did lot of extreme things. Means there are such people troubling saints they will bother but we have to be careful. We shouldn't become like them. At the end he wrote against me to Government. Means gainst all of us. That they are like this like that... We are not taking single penny what they can find out about me? So in Government also you see how it happens. That Lokayukt (an authority dealing with anticorruption) summoned Mr.Pradhan our trustee. They summoned.They send me letter I forgot to tell you. Justice Kotwal asked him "Who is this MATAJI?" He was chief justice and he junior lawyer to father. He saw me when I was little baby at Nagpur. And my father was amazing human being very great. Means if he has arrived in court even Chief Justice used to get up from their chair. So infront of him (Father) they used to get up. Such people were there. Means very great people.Means thats why I was born to him. Means after all happenning he found out details of this person. He wrote one letter to me. I have shown that letter to Saheb(Sir C.P.) He wrote in it that he have found out this persons address and my duty is to punish such peoples who are troubling peoples like you. But I want your permission. Then I wrote him, "You see, once he called me Mother so don't do anything. Saheb (Sir C.P.) said " Why not? Why are you saying this?" He was even angry at me. I said "No. Once he has called me Mother then however may be son I accept him" Still he suffered alot. But still we have be careful we have to be vigilent alert. Because after realisation negativity can enter within by many means and it not only take you on wrong path but also take you to very wrong path and people have to suffer alot. Like this many instances have happened.

In same manner there was another person. Let me just tell you a little bit When he came to Sahajayoga he had bad habits about women. I told him many times that you change your this habit. Turn down your eyes turn down your eyes. Don't go on looking at women. This is not allowed in Sahajayoga. Mean a while negativity entered in him. And I gave him alot of powers and when he got these powers. He used take out bhoots nicely. Then he started doing such things on one girl.In that dirt he flown away.While flowing in that he got so much negativity within him that he took many people in that dirt. I pull all them out but he just flow away in that dirt and got lost.And he got so many attacks that only poverty came at his doorstep. Now he has just became mad just mad. Just became mad. His wife so positive but she is just weeping now. His son is realised. He is always beating him. Though after having so much he got completely apocalypsed. Till now I am telling him that you completely beg for forgiveness Then only these deities will be agreed because all this is not my work it's all Bhairva's work. It's Bhairava's work. He is very difficult deity I am telling you. These Black threads etc.. are Bhairava's ..... Only he knows them. That Bhairava has to give. It's very difficult to preserve it. It is very subtle and how to say a deity who highly punishes. It is not easy to take care for this deity. So I told him that Bhairva has disfavored you. So you beg for his forgiveness and we will also change you and will see and sakshat (In person) Bhairava gave Darshan (Auspicious visit) to him one day. You will be surprised that from my agya chakra Bhairava came out and he saw that. Very Dark Black... he (Bhairava) came and did circumambulation(Pradakshina) to me three times and folded his hands and went away. When he saw this in reality still he was not afraid and he thought how it will come to Mataji's notice? Whatever way we may behave is ok doesn't matter.

Means afterwards people were so afraid that so if we want to prepare one ashram then we should make only floor so that we can stay in Mataji's kingdom if there will be second floor then it will get dirty such fear people were having. People are afraid upto this extent. So we should be vigilent. We have many weaknesses and they are tested after Sahajayoga. So we should be positive and we should obtain it. For this we don't have to leave household Should have childrens. Well organised auspicious events should be done. Should get marry. Childrens should be born and today so many great souls so many saints are awaiting to take birth. They should have such lovely beautiful household. If there were not so holy people in this world like my father and mother it was difficult for me too take birth in this world. They were so holy that you wo'nt believe. Both of them husband and wife were very very holy. So if such husband and wife came into world and if they establish such family and if they establish such a beautiful oraganisation then such great great people will be born and they will be so much helpful to us in Sahajayoga. In such home if one Sahajayogi is born then even if any other Sahajayogis are spoiled he will put them right and will cleanse them out. Now my granddaughter, she is telling me that,"I am only praying to God Almighty that.." I asked her "What?" She said "All people should get realised in our family should get realised at once and if all people in this world gets realised then it will be so joyous. There will not be any trouble." and through her innocent mind she just asked this nothing else. That no falsehood, no hypocrisy, no superficial thing. But that whatever is truth should everyone get. She is asking me, "Why are you cooking for everyone Nani?" "You just do this about everyone. Just do this. Somehow you will be able to do it." She is just asking this prayer to God everyday night and tears are rolling out of her little eyes. What an innocent mind is this, what she want is that everyone should be realised. Her mind is so much Motherly. You ask these Sahajayogis who came to us for them she used to fetch water for them in bucket with her little hands. Used to ask them to keep feet in that water. Wash their one one feet. Used to wipe their face. Very little she was five years maybe not even five yrs. Five years she became later on. Wipe out their face. Wash their feet. After doing all this then throw away that water in toilet. They used to keep back those buckets. But she used to say "No no all I will do myself." All work she did by herself. And after that she came to my feet and then she said that "Now after this I will not do anything ok." and then run away. Always she used to be present there. They used be so much worried about everyones little little things. How this is going wrong? where is this going wrong? My another grand daughter who is in hostel, she told everyone that "This food is hot make it cool down like this (vibrate). My grandmother told." All those childrens are doing like that. School staff was asking "What she has taught them?" But those childrens liked it, So since then they are doing like this and vibrating it and then eating. Like wise in many places these little little souls do great great work. Yes, his son was telling Avdhut that remove shoes.

Sahajayogi: "While beating hold sleepers upside down and beat." Shri Mataji: What she has told me if you listen it you will be surprised. Such great souls should be born in this world. Her father was working in Petroleum dept. in Indian Oil. So she used to listen that in our country oil is very less very less petrol this that..She was quite small at that time may be three three and half yrs. old.Then one day she told to Modi that "In our country have very less petrol" then he said "Yes yes now it's very less." He said "This is very easy work. You do one thing that in some petrol you let Mataji dip her feet and that petrol you can put in nearby sea somewhere then petrol will come over there itself."

So Modi when we went to Bordi he took oil over there and put it you see. You will be surprised that she used to tell him so many things. One day one women came she was caught up. So she went inside and brought one big broom. And she was showing me that from curtain. I said "What is this?" She said "Use this on her so it will be better." I said "Upon her??" She said "No just beat on sides two times she will be better." "Not above but from sides two times she will be better." and it really happened . She knows so many things. My grand son also he also know so much. I feel he is just Shankaracharya's incarnation. Just cannot explain it... They are just beating (improvising) everyone from morning till evening. Their grandfather asked them that "You are beating everyone but why don't you beat your Grandmother?" Then they replied "What is this unwise talk?" Then he asked "Why?" He replied "Whether anyone is beating Goddesss" "She is the Greatest Goddess. Shall anyone beat her??"

Means you see so much wisdom though they are just four years old..Mine Anand (Shree Mataji's grandson) He is only four years old. All these kids he put them right by tapping them. He used to tell them that I will ride upon you like horse and he tapped upon their Kundalini so much and put them all all right. And like wise there are many many great souls whom we don't recognize them. Make your good family.In many families some male are realised but women are not realised or if women is realised then men are not realised. Make them right then such great souls will be born to you. It has to be there at the base if it's not there then will be very difficult. That's why there many Sahajyogis who are not ready to get marry. I am really tired of. They are telling me that "There is some union Mataji its very suffering. We can see other Sahajayogis after marriage their brains gets roasted due to wives." "So no no Sir." Everybody has been doing same. So such Sahajayogis also after proper thought over should get marry with some people who are on right path. This is my point. and now we have came in this wedding hall so here itself get marry. It's good place. Some Sahajayogi said "Collective wedding." Shri Mataji nodded "Yes collective wedding" And again I give alot of blessings for this. So likewsie many marriages should be performed here. Sahajayogis should make such good families where such great saints will be able to born.

Sahaja Yogi : "When the kundalini shakti comes at the Vishudhi chakra, at that time some people feel catch which has caused due to chanting of wrong mantras before, the same reaction is stored there. To remove that catch, one of important mantra to clear is,Sarv Mantra Sidhhi sakshat,this mantra can nourish the vishudhi chakra. How to recite that mantra, I will tell, please repeat after me 3 times the mantra."

"Om Tvamev Sakshat Shri Sarv Mantra Siddhi Sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah" ( All the sahaja yogis repeat it 3 times).

H.H. Shri Mataji: Now to improve Sahastrara , the mantra to be taken is Sahajayogadayini sakshat, this develops the gratitude.

Sahaja Yogi: Now to improve Sahastrara and for its progress I will say the mantra and everyone should repeat it. When the Kundalini comes to Sahastrar and if you want to feel it, this mantra can give you a better feeling. We should keep it in our practice to say this mantra 3 times.

"Om Tvamev sakshat Shri Sahajayogadayini Sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah"

H.H. Shri Mataji: "Mahayogadayini also can be said, Mahayogdayini is also the same."

Sahajayogi: "There is one more mantra for it."

H.H. Shri Mataji: "This is the King of all yoga, this enhances the acceptance."

Sahajayogi: "For acceptance Sahajayogadayini and for the perfection Mahayogadayini should be recited.Lets repeat the same."

"Om Tvamev Sakshat Shri Mahayogadayini sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah." Everyone repeat it 3 times.

H.H. Shri Mataji: "Now one more thing, few things about the treatment should also be told. You can tell them... one thing I feel is about liver..how to improve liver, what should be done for the liver, I will tell in brief. If there is a catch on right nabhi then it comes on Liver possibly. Liver is here in right side below rib cage. Importance of liver is that, whatever toxic is there in our body, after selecting that liver throws it out in the blood stream and if this selection is not done then it gets mixed up in the liver and creates tremendous heat in the liver. Now how does liver gets problem, in childhood children are given some heavy food like oil, ghee, peanuts. Also the peanut oil is difficult to digest.Sesame oil should be used by Sahajayogis. Now you know that Gujarati people have a new disease that they get white spots on their skin. What do you call it..?? All those happens due to liver. All skin diseases happen due to liver.. all skin diseases. That time sometimes nervousness is also there , mostly 99% skin diseases are due to liver .. Therefore liver has to be well taken care of.. Life is there till liver ,It's on right side, its called as Yakrut( Liver). The reason why liver gets into problem because in childhood we give food to children which are not digestive to liver.Ghee, oil and sometimes milk with too much of cream , that should not be given up to 12 years of age. It should be prohibited. Take out cream from the milk then give.Milk with cream should not be given , Shrikhand( One type of a sweet in India) which have too much cream Items in which too much of oil, Ghee or fried things are there, we have a practice here , it should not be given to small children.

And the antidote for it is Chana. Chana is very good, protein. All Proteins are good for liver but fish & all that heats up the liver that is not nutritious. In protein also e.g. Toor daal (pigeon pea split) is not good for the liver. Moong dal (Green gram split) is good, for small kids moong dal should be given. If you have to make Toor dal then put Amsul ( dry Kokum) in that. Without Amsul (dry kokum) Toor dal should not be taken.

There are 2 types, one is hot liver & other is cold liver. If the liver is hot then what happens is, people get nausea , acid comes up, body doesn't get nutrition, body cannot absorb nutrition, doesn't feel hungry, gets morning dizziness, always gets headaches, These are the symptoms of hot liver. So what is the solution for hot liver? It is said that heat kills the heat. In summer it is not possible but in winters the solution is possible. Take beaten Ginger and mix it with sugar and eat in the morning. Sugar is the diet of the liver. Suagar is food for liver.Only Sugar, not that sugar in fried items or in sweets. Rather than the sugar which comes from sugar cane more than that Khadi Sakhar ( Means rock candy, bigger pieces of sugar) is good. In summer during hot, Amsul (dry Kokum) is the best. Amsul ( dry Kokum) and Lemon are very good for liver. Amsul (kokum) can be soaked in water and mix it with sugar and keep taking , it is very good. It should not be fried. Amsul (dry kokum) water should not be fried, Amsul means dry Kokum, as we call it as kokum. Kokum syrup no, it should be home made. The Kokum syrup which we make at home that, not from the market. Market Kokum, Amrit Kokum etc not be used. If we can make it at home then why to get it from the market.

Now, the extremes of liver is Jaundice. Now the simple solution for the Jaundice is, simple 2 cent solution is ,take the leaves of Muli ( Radish). Normally people don't eat it but it should be eaten. Whichever is good , we give it to animals. Radish should be eaten a lot but not for those who have Gas . For those who don't have Gas trouble , they should eat alot of Radish. It's like one has one side e.g. if there is gas then Pitta(Acid) will not be there, if there is a Pitta ( Acid) then Gas wont be there. Its all balancing. Radish should be eaten, the leaves of the Radish should be boiled , put some Khadi Sakhar (Rock candy) in that (Boiled) water, and no other water should be drank , only that water should be taken . That soup should be taken, only rock candy should be used , no salt. That water should be taken. It's a medicine worth 2 cents. Take it for 3 days for Jaundice. Another medicine which Sahaja Yogis can do it, of course you have to vibrate it. Vibrations doesn't need any money. It's free . For Jaundice , Sahajayogis should do one more thing if they have that capability. It's easy, as Aradhana said that oil pulls oil. During Jaundice its an emergency, Take Mustard oil (yellow oil) , take it in a bowl. Place 2 fingers (Index and middle finger, the fingers of Vishuddhi and Nabhi) Sahajayogi should rotate it in bronze bowl. Take oil in a little big bronze bowl. Nearly this much big bowl should be so that finger can move freely in it. And likewise these two fingers should be rotated means of Nabhi chakra and Vishuddhi chakra. So these two fingers should be rotated likewise. If you feel can take this one also together.Swadhishthana finger and ask that person (who got Jaundice) to watch the movement of fingers. When Nabhi chakra and Swadishthan chakra has problem Jaundice happens. Ask that person to watch it , the result of jaundice shows up on your eyes, it becomes yellowish. You can see how swadishthan and eyes are connected with each other. I will tell you more about it. As you move the fingers in oil, oil will become thicker and thicker. You should not see in his eyes but ask him to keep seeing the finger movements in the oil. The oil gets foam now , It irritates the eyes sometimes but ask him to keep watching it. Then just go on moving your fingers. It becomes thick foam now, then it should be thrown it away. Repeat it next day, do it for 3 days. 3rd day Jaundice will be go away. This is how eyes become clear and this is how two methods can be done. Now about diabetes, I tell you. Diabetes is a very common disease now which is going to increase, it happens due to imbalance. Those who think too much, plan too much diabetes happens to them. Diabetes happens due to pancreas, due to too much use of the right side. For that keep left hand towards the photograph. Pancreas is here, below the left rib cage, keep right hand on it. We can feel the pulsation on our hand and left hand towards the photograph. If you are treating others, then left hand towards the photo and right towards left rib cage (below). This is the work of swadhishthan chakra to supply to pancreas. There is always effect of diabetes on eyes. You see how eyes are connected to swadishthan chakra, we should remember this.

At that time, we should raise Kundalini from left side and put it on the right side , left to right. What happens when we put left to right, the ego which comes up due to over activities of work, it comes down. If people have ego, of any higher position or if they have something then there is always a subtle ego. Sahaja yogis also have ego that we are so powerful etc..They should put left to right. Once it comes from left right then the Kundalini shakti should be awakened in the center. Vibration will start flowing. Left side is about love, when we do over activities, our attention is not on love. That's why our love side from left should be raised and put it on right. Putting left to right the balance comes. Women are different mostly, now today's women are different. Their planning goes on since morning. As soon as they wake up in the morning, the plan starts, which pickle should we make, which papad. They have to send kids to school,for them what , then which saree to wear. Now a days women need cosmetics, and then matching blouse is there or not? Then its planning. Then if they don't have then from others they have to ask then go to tailor running around and ask to make it by tomorrow etc.. very subtle planning goes on of women. Even after doing this what is the result, can't be seen if standing amongst some people. After running around so much what's the use, the blouse is stiched can't even be noticed. Hairs have to be like this and so on , it has to be like this & that. If this is there it means the right side is on. Now in morning the car has to start at 9, means it has to happen. Wearing the watch , means gone. Everything is going to be on time, Mine is so much punctual that if I don't reach, the aero plane will not take off. If i don't reach the car won't start. I am always on time(Tithi).

Day before yesterday, in Rahuri, they did Puja and Havan, it should be done on Navami (9th day) not on Ashtami (8th day). Instead of 10, they kept it at 1 o clock. So I slept, let see. Of course after waking up, apologies why didn't you wake me up ( a kind of drama or maya played by Param Pujya Shri Mataji). You should have woken me up and all that. Then sat and they got know that Navami has just started. It ( Navami) started at 4.30 and it went very well, nothing wrong. Other day Mehtani came and invited for lunch. On that day a visit to a land was organized 10 miles away, after going there, reached at this showroom at 2.30. One should not be slave of the watches. How much we hurt others due to slavery of the watches we don't know. We think that we are organized but it becomes very unorganized. It all happens on time for me.

An interesting story, My husband( Sir CP), is very particular about the time so during the wedding of elder daughter. I always play some tricks and disturb their timings. He gets to know that I have done something. Just an interesting thing, of course its done with pure wisdom. You are all Sahajayogis so there is no harm in telling you.In wedding, he took everyone for the task. They (groom's side people) all came from Lucknow , they all were highly relaxed. Like morning 6am they should take bath and 7 am should finish breakfast. Despite we being (bride's side), were very strict with them. What is this going on, they were saying that we have to finish in one day. They want to go in one day, let it be but what is this going on (regarding the strictness of time). They also came to Mumbai so they were all put under strict discipline of the time. It was over strictness (by Sir C.P). There is a tradition in UP that when Groom enters the door, the bride has to put a garland like a swayamvar (Bride accepting the groom). Without her acceptance the marriage doesn't take place. It's a good tradition. Girl should garland the Groom. This was all set as per time. Bride should come at that time and all that. The groom should be on stage.It should be on time, groom is welcomed at the door and puja of the groom is done and all that. Then he should come inside, it all started from here after. But instead of coming inside he was lost somewhere. Something happened then, bride started with the garland, where is the groom. Everyone got surprised that where Groom run away? Where is the groom? What should we do now? For fifteen minutes there was no clue of the groom. I was laughing.. Saheb ( Sir CP) came and told me, you have done something ! Sir CP said It is very clear that you should have done something, some chakra's movement and all that. I said you were going so fast so I thought you must take it easy. Sir CP asked Where is the groom, I said he must be there somewhere upstairs or so. Groom was so strained that he had to go to bathroom, Rather than coming here he directly went upstairs. First time he was wearing a chudidar ( a tight payjama), so it was difficult to open. When Sir CP went up, people were helping him. Like this all chaos happened. Then groom came and all went well after that as per schedule. You will be surprised that Jaymala ( exchange of garlands) happened on time as per muhurt (auspicious time).

On this muhurt ( a specific auspicious time) so many interesting things have happened. This Muhurt is also within us only, not something outside. Day before yesterday, there was one, we have some brahmins they are so perfect. I really appreciate them, they have really put this Brahminism on place. We have one brahman his name is Phadke, he has done all these studies (about the auspicious time and all that). He knows everything, he knows Sahaja yoga is a true thing & all that. He has one Shradhh ( a kind of ritual which is performed when someone is dead in their house). He asked one Brahman to come to his house to perform the ritual of Shradhh and asked him when can he come. Now the other brahman who has to go to many places for Shraddh food so he told one particular day as per his convenience. Then he came back to home and took out his calender. Phadke saw his calendar and found that there is no auspicious time on that day rather it was not a good day. Then the other brahmin reached on that day after nicely fasting so that he can eat more (at Phadke's house). Phadke asked to him according to which panchang (a book or calendar where people refer the auspicious time) you found this time. He said some thing , phadke said this is not a right day or time. He was disturebed a little. Phadke showed him the panchang and said today cannot do there is no auspicious time today. Then why did you come to have food at my place today and why did you speak lie? Now I will not serve you food, You have come as guest so have a cup of tea and go. I will not serve food to you. And I will perform the Shraddh ritual myself and on time. I( Phadke said) am capable of doing it and his wife said what are you doing? He said nothing doing, he is doing falsehood and he is false person and only came for food. Ask him to go back. His mother also said and they all agreed then Phadke did it himself. His studies are so deep that he has done so much of research that I (Shri Mataji) told him to write down all this. He even could tell when does the crow will touch the food ( It's a tradition that the food of Shraddh has to be touched by the crow). On vibrations he could say that whether is father's soul is there or not and all that, very subtle level he found out.Its worth appreciating, If he writes all, this would be a good thing. So that everyone would know that those who are not realized, how do they all do the religious rituals but it doesn't have benefit because they don't know anything. They just speak but they don't know anything. They don't understand any auspiciousness or inauspiciousness. Until they stand on truth, it doesn't work out.

There is story of Shahpe, punishment of Shahpe.There was a man called Shahpe,he went & told a king that he is a big architect by showing wrong certificates. The king agreed and appointed him as Architect. King said now you build a new township,gave him lot money and that land. After 2 years King enquired then he said yes its ready , you can come & have a look at it. He just spent all money on his own enjoyment. He didn't do anything. When King visited the place and looked around, there was nothing on the land. King asked what is this? The architect said yes it is there , you can't see it, it requires an eye to see. You don't have inner eyes, then king said is it so? Architect said, look at this, it is your courtyard, this is your throne. You have to sit on this throne & all that. All only words no real thing. Now King is after all King, he said ok you seems to be very clever. King said good that you really did a good work, I am very pleased. Now in this situation I grant you one thing, you sit on my throne now. Now you sit , why don't you sit, I will honor you. In such situation King asked the so called fraud architect to sit on it. He has to sit. There was no throne nothing. Don't get up now, sit here only. We will give you food and all will do here only. After 4-5 hours he got scared then the architect accepted that this was all falsehood. This punishment of Shahpe is going to happen to all false people.

That's why You all should stand on truth. There is so much of truth in all the religions, don't make it unrighteousness of it. For earnings, unrighteousness should not be done. This thing should be kept in mind. Now last thing that I have to tell to the sahaja yogis, that those saints who are not there now, their examples people accepts. For example people accepts what Gyaneshwara has said but not what I am saying now because I am living now. Its very sad that when the person is living , people do not accept. At that time people will trouble him but after the death they will do puja. Reason is, he is now in our hand, after the death of the saint what, that's true. In the temple of Gyaneshwara, they said to me, you do that Lezim (a kind of folk dance of Maharashtra), I didn't understand why is that so here..(some discussion among the sahaja yogis about whether it is Lezim or Dindi means a procession). Shri Mataji says there is a word for it ..forgotten.. yes it is Dindya means procession. Shri Mataji asked "Has Gyaneshwara did this? Did he danced on Lezim or procession?" So those people said "He is Gyaneshwara.. " Shri Mataji said who are you? he did manan ( means introspection) they said we should not do manan(introspection). Did he say like this? They have made so big temples of Saint Gyaneshwara and they are going there. Please don't do the same thing with me ( Shri Mataji). What ever it's there , I have already told you. Whatever is prohibited is prohibited and whatever is to be accepted to be accepted, no compromise at all. Check on vibrations.

The other day I told that people go to Ram Krishna ashram, Some people came here I asked what did you get there? some philanthropic work, means distribution of food to poor & all that like missionaries work. Have you heard of such work that distribution of food is the work of God? Started food distribution for poor people. It's not God's work. God almighty is like Laxmi swaroop , in the form of Laxmi. He will fill you with Laxmi not distributing the food. This is the expression of ego, Now as soon as I said like this, one gentleman was not happy with it and asked me why do you criticize them. I told him , I am not criticizing them but they have criticized themselves. These people who have started this food distribution buisness,even Vivekanand didn't do this, not even his guru did it like this. Only by distributing food they are trying to gain the name, they don't earn anything of their own. Someone gives them food and these people only just distribute it. Some one has to give them money and they just distribute like a middleman. They are like middleman we appoint like cheff or someone like that. Donating that thing which doesn't belong to us. Such people will always ask "Why Mataji has criticized those people?" "Why she said like this?" Now I am not contesting any election to say all good things for each and every person. Whatever is correct I will say it's correct that and whatever is wrong I will say it's wrong. Now there some gurus who are realized I have to say that they are realized, but those who are not realized how can I say that they are realized & why should I say like that.Is it because you will feel bad. I will not say indirectly that time but will tell it slowly & directly.

Now there is one more gentleman from Nagar(Now known as Ahilyanagar). He had a photograph of a false guru,very bad person. He destroyed the Kundalini so badly. In your Pune he was very famous. He destroyed the Kundalini so badly that Kundalini used to fall down and it was a great difficulty for me. Later on I got to know that this is that false guru. When I came to Mumbai, I went to meet him. Went to visit all, tried to make all of them understand. Now went to meet them so they started saying she is our disciple. What should I say , such stupid people. When I went there, they asked me to wait because he is now taking bath. Took one & half hour for bath,is he so dirty. One & half hour bath and now he is in Mauna ( Means silence, wont speak to anyone) won't look at anyone. So when is he going to meet? Later on they all came, all wet and those with him also were wet. Then went upstairs for their lunch. It was also a big show. Others seems to be quite poor people. Somehow they would have arranged some money and made that arrangements and this ascetic why he need such a big event of food? Then he sat for lunch, took 2 hours for lunch. What is this going on, like this it took 4 hours..

"What kind of a sanyasi he is,I don't think he will understand anything. Nothing will go in his mind." Finally I left the place. He calls himself Sanyasi and how is he sitting and having food on someone else expenses. All the expenses, that person has done it for him. He got Pneumonia next day then he came to me because he was all wet. Food had to be cooked wearing wet clothes, all those brahmin's(priest) got cough. What is the need of asking that person to prepare food after wearing wet clothes, what's wrong they did? If he ( the false guru) is so pure then why is he so scared of anything.You all know I am so pure that nothing touches me. That's a simple thing.There is one more lady,if anyone touches her, she falls down. Is she a Rakshas or what that short circuit is happening. Fuse blows out of them. You are purer than them, Now if I say like this, you say Mataji you are criticizing them. What I say (about Sahaja yogis) is that they are disciples, this is their wealth of many lives, their Kundalini, which they have got now. Those who don't know anything about the Kundalini write books, unauthorized gesture and then peoples Kundalini gets spoilt due to that reading. Later give them some diksha, give them some knowledge with some (metal or letter or leaf). Through (metal or letter or leaf) can they sprout a seed. With mudras they will give, How is it possible to raise Kunalini with patra (metal or leaf or letter)? What is the relationship between Patra (Metal or letter or leaf) and Kundalini? What they give with patra (metal or leaf or letter) are bhoots.

The difference is, in England also they do but they say that they are putting spirits inside. Here they call it Kundalini. In the name of God , doing the work of Bhoots in the name of God. This is Kaliyuga, similarly Rakshasas call themselves as Guru this is Kaliyuga. Now lets say someone calls himself as Ravana then will anyone allow him to stay. That's why they say I am God, what's required to say like, does it require anything to say like. but you can see their symptoms. But recognize their qualities.

If you stay with such people for 10 days, you will get to know that he is Butcher.That he is a evil person but he will hypnotize to that level that no one can see his qualities. Its hypnosis, that's why you can't see it that he is a bad person, But you will know that he is evil person he is crooking but due to hypnosis you can't see it. Agya chakra gets caught up. Now there is a lady with us, she told us that there was a guru and his disciple came and she helped us alot , and she told us likewise ... I said first of all she is the disciple of that (false guru) and this person crook no.1 and on top if she is his disciple (another lady), what will be her level and moreover you listen to her, why so? Means Agya is caught up, you are under hypnosis. You can see everything but still you can't see anything. You get into such a bondage under their hypnosis. If you have seen any program of hypnosis, many people do it like Sarkar etc. If someone is hypnotized to become a small child then you will start drinking milk with the bottle. Anything you will do, forcefully you will do it. Even if you don't like it, still it happens. This is hypnosis,

That's why you should understand that if Shri Mataji is saying something is wrong then it must be wrong. Why should I say like this, if I say remove this locket or thread then what's my gain. Am I going to sell it again? Why Shri Mataji is saying so, that should be understood. When such people say leave that, you want your Kundalini awakening. Shri Mataji doesn't need anything from you. Then if Shri Mataji says so then why don't you follow that. People get upset with small small things , that time Sahaja yogis should remember that If some one says Shri Mataji has said something bad about someone then they must be. Don't need to doubt about it. Because we have tested everything.

I was telling you about them when I went to Nagar, he had that photograph ( Of that false Guru). Immediately I said, I want to sleep in inner room. He didn't understand. He said please sleep here only. Shri Mataji said no I want to sleep inside. He also was unable to understand why Mataji insisted so much? He said,it's not alright there please sleep here only. I said No no I will sleep inside only. I went inside by taking reason and took that photograph and told him to remove it. You don't have courage to do so remove it since I am telling you. I can understand that. They don't have courage to remove it, they feel afraid of removing the photographs(of false gurus). They know that the person has ruined them but still they are afraid of. Remove them , I will beat them with shoes in front of you. Bring them, let's see what will he do? Because of fear the person doesn't leave them. There is no freedom. If some one says then you should say with confidence that we have tested all that he (their false guru) is a wrong person then his bhoots will also run away. There is no doubt about it. I have verified everything. If you say this confidently then that person can be freed from that guru. That's why many a times its necessary we have to say like this ( about false gurus). That's why I say this to all sahaja yogis that whatever I have told about something wrong that means it is wrong. It is absolutely wrong and it has to be told about the same without any compromise. Hope you spent good amount of time today, now lets get the darshan (Auspicious sight of deity or holy person).
