(Shri Mataji’s talk started)

(Namaste)

One has to know, at the very outset, the truth is what it is.

We cannot organize it. We cannot order it.

It is (not clear)

The greatest truth is that we are all looked after, nourished, and brought to this total awareness; by the All-Pervading Power of God’s love.

43:00

This power does all the living process.

Like this flower you see here, are miracles. How they sprout, is tremendous.

But we take everything for granted, we take everything for granted.

43:55

We take everything for granted because we are not used to it.

In the same way, we have taken our human lives for granted.

We have beautiful eyes which are like a camera.

and we are computer, in a way that we are already programmed for many things.

But still, we are not in the absolute truth.

44:47

We live in a relative world.

So, somebody thinks that a particular theory is good, and some think that another theory is good.

But there is no one idea, about oneness.

One has to know, the absolute.

Unless and until we know the absolute there will be all kinds of problems existing within us.

Now, whatever has been told to you about Sahaja yoga, whatever you have heard about Sahaja yoga is the knowledge of our roots.

46:25

Now, what we see outside our growth, is the knowledge of the tree.

We have to know the roots otherwise this tree will be destroyed.

46:55

Now, whatever I'm telling you just now, you have to just understand it like a hypothesis.

47:12

And you should keep your minds open like a scientist.

And see for yourself, what is the meaning of our being.

Why are we on this earth?

So, first of all, we have to know ourselves.

We don't know ourselves.

And for that, we have to have our self-realization.

48:15

In our evolutionary process, we have become human beings.

48:28

And we are very evolved compared to animals.

Supposing a dog or a horse has to go through the dirty way, it cannot go.

48:47

But if human beings have to go, they know it's dirty, they know it's filthy.

But there is a higher state,

which you have to achieve.

49:14

You have the right to achieve it.

It is the living process of your evolution, the living process.

So, you cannot pay for it.

As a seed has to be sowed, in the mother earth it sprouts by itself spontaneously.

We don't pay to the mother earth.

It is spontaneous.

50:06

That spontaneity is Sahaja, is Sahaja.

And this has to happen, to most of us.

50:29

And we all have to know, that unless and until a complete transformation takes within, just by talking about peace and love, we cannot establish this.

50:47

Now, as...(not clear), I have worked (walked)for one hour I think, all about Sahaja yoga,

because we lost our way, and we are late, I'm sorry for that.

I must have given thousands of lectures about Sahaja Yoga.

But any amount of lecture doesn't just work out.

It's an actualization of your baptism, it's actualization.

51:39

So, this has to work out.

We should not be lost, in the realm of words.

By arguments, it won't work out. It is something that has to work out within.

So, I would say that you can ask me some questions, sensible questions and then, we can have the session to have your self-realization.

53:26

(Question & answer) \

(Question in Portuguese) Lady do TM Meditation?

(Translation unclear)

53:26

Shri Mataji answered:

Kundalini rises like a jet.

But sometimes you have problems in your centers,

so we have to attend to it.

but in any case, in this session today, your Kundalini will breakthrough, no doubt.

54:02

Most of you, I should say.

But later on, you have to fix your connection.

and you... (not clear)

54:22

and you have so many Sahaja yogis here who can help.

(more questions)

54:54

(answer)

Yes, so Kundalini can only be awakened by somebody Who has Divine authority.

And so far, we have had so many people who had been to Kundalini awakening, and they never felt any bad experience.

and one has to know that, awakening your Kundalini is the easiest way.

56:19

But you have to know the job.

Now, in a place like Bombay, I get about 12,000 to 15,000 people.

and they get realization, all of them.

Also, Sahaja yoga is like this, that first, a little light is tingling in your attention.

57:01

Now, suppose you are holding on to some snake, and I tell you there is a snake.

But in darkness, you (not clear) and you'll not accept.

57:14

But, if there is light, even slight light, you'll throw it.

So, the first thing is that you should get light, and in that light, you'll see.

If the light is less, we can increase the light.

57:58

I tell you, there have never been more seekers in the world before.

As here, so many of you are great seekers of truth.

And it is very remarkable.

Have faith in yourself.

58:33

(Question: He wants to know if there's something to do between Sahaja Yoga and Tantra yoga.)

Of course, Sahaja Yoga is tantric (??)

Because I tell you, I'll explain it to you.

They try to spoil your system by mesmerism.

And, then they charge you,

and you are supposed to give all your money, everything to them.

They are very immoral., and (?)

I would not like to tell you once they do it.

But you can say, they are your people who are in black magic.

So it's the misnomer, you call it, the tantra.

A misnomer is the wrong name, you call it tantra is the wrong name because this is the instrument.

1:00:45

(Question: What is the responsibility of a spiritual leader?)

(Answered by Shri Mata Ji)

To love, all the disciples.

And forgive them.

And guide them to get benevolence and to rise,

and complete responsibility,

to look after the health and all the problems of the disciples.

1:01:54

(Question: The disciples, do they have any responsibilities in their ascent?)

The disciples themselves become the gurus.

They become empowered.

(Portuguese question:)

1:02:37

Translator:

(She said that in this society, there are many disturbances, many things that they have to do and how can they ascend to get the purity themselves with all these bad things around)

1:03:41

You see because (not clear)

There's nothing to give up.

It is something within that happens.
