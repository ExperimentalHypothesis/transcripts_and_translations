Hindi - daanth he nahhe hain unke dohee daanth hain: he doesn’t have teeth, he has only 2 teeth.

Shri Mataji : Hindi - Nahe chahiye, nahe chahiye: no need, no need, Hindi - jor se, yahaa se phir to sunayee nahee deraha hai : a bit louder, not audible.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, may I also introduce you this gentleman, this is the man, I told you wants to make the video at the interview, and also he is the friend of that gentleman you met in Munich at Marian statue.

Shri Mataji: Yaa, I see I see.

Hindi - Acha jara inse baat karle : Okey, Please talk to him.

She told me about you. And whatever help you want to be, we are willing to give you, whatever footage you wants.

And you can see for yourself what you need. Because most of the footage is with you now. And also we have got these prophecies and things and visions which is describing all these things Unclear(I say is true). If you move with this, you understand English is it? What I am saying that, you have this visions and things. so these are the prophecies made and it just you can sort of show them on the film. Because we have places like one place where one poet Louis from England has described the procession that we have. You tell her.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, he would like to ask what happened to him because he also had some experience.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogini: Unclear() I saw a very clear cool breeze is coming out.

Shri Mataji: Really? He is embarrassed.

Yogi: It seems it might also some enjoyment for everyone and so he will tell and will ask you what happened to him.

Shri Mataji: that’s very great, Unclear(play, replay) this to see here.

Yogi:  Shri Mataji, despite his young age he made carrier with the well very known company (Virgin Records) it’s a video company and he is now a manager there and also he had up to now, he was not knowing that he has spiritual interests, he was in yes many of us. He was in Indonesia and there something happened to him.

Shri Mataji: Where did you go?

Yogi: To Indonesia.

Shri Mataji: Bali

Yogi: It was in Bali when he woke up during the night he was seeing whole light in whole his body all his cells and then the breathing changed the rhythm of the breathing.

Shri Mataji: He saw the light.

Yogi: He saw the light all over, and also in each cell.

Yogi: He used to swim during this time a lot, the more he was in the ocean the more he got creative thoughts(sentence repeated) and he wrote them down a lot. But then also he got some capabilities which allowed him to forecast a little bit of future.

Somehow he is not sure if he was hearing a voice it was just by his intuition that if I am you a word, a word I am you it means tatvamasi.

Shri Mataji, when this happened to him at a very Unclear(faster) age his girlfriend with whom he was with five years left him immediately, he also lost his job because his ideas which they did not understand in a commercialized company.

Shri Mataji: what he has ideas? I see.

Yogi : Also he is saying and there was a time again the light was coming and he felt thoughtless and he described it like he was a glass of water, he was just existing. He was a water.

Shri Mataji: Water?

Yogi : He was just thoughtless and one with everything. He felt in this way.

Then he got also intuition voice or don’t know exactly, which telling him about a(n) eternal life and a saint of human being but later on he got afraid about his development.

So, in the process, more he got afraid the less he could perceive it again, he wasn’t able to feel and to smell or human beings everything.

He is saying now its not get strong anymore it is in the past, he was able to give somebody their hand and they asked why would the hair stand on their hands

Shri Mataji : What? Their hands?

Yogi : Yes.

Shri Mataji: The hair?

Yogi: Their hair.

Shri Mataji: His or theirs?

Yogi: Theirs.

Shri Mataji: You are one of us. You are one of us. That’s why.

Yogi: and that’s the reason why he knows that he should produce such films because also these are such films the initiation come to the people.

Shri Mataji: See, now there is such a trend. People are realizing that they laid on the weaknesses of the human beings, and tried to make films of such kind which were destructive. But recently I read it that there is one film producer film maker and director who has come out with a very novel idea that he made a picture in which he shows how we play games and cheat each other in a sort of a love game and all that and how we hurt. And he has written that I have hurt myself not somebody like that. So now I know what it is. And he is made a film like that. The name of the film I forgotten. Very interesting name it has. And it became such a popular film many people came to see that.

Shri Mataji: Surprisingly I read this in a newspaper. See,

Yogi : Unclear()

Shri Mataji: Ya, it is something such a enlightenment within yourself that to start seeing that we are in a way destroying people. That the way I destroyed he says, that I hurt, many are hurting and I should not any more do that again.

Shri Mataji: And this is the resurrection I think of a person. That he sees himself as an instrument to correct others by seeing his own faults that he has done so far. So this is a very unique thing that has started. But when I read Tolstoy, his book resurrection there is a heroine Katyusha Maslova has to cut so much lower and the hero is Andrei and the Hero spoils the life of this girl. She was just a maidservant, and he was a son of a very rich man. Then he becomes the judge and this girl comes as a woman like a prostitute. And the whole thing comes into his head how she was a innocent girl and I ruined her. And the whole thing Tolstoy has brought such a beautiful thing of the transformation of that man. That’s the resurrection.

So in the films now say now you see dalas and all these things is everybody is just the same. There is no transformation of any kind. Just the same. If he is a bad man, he is a bad man, is good man, he is a good man, there is no happening of transformation. And also the psychology of human beings is this very easily.. say, there is a man who is very powerful and he tries to torture people who do all kinds of things. The people start copying that bad man.  So, you see, I think also the writers and the film-makers are also responsible very much for ruining this world. I was on a sensor board for two years, they had appointed me then I resign. The reason was, I mean they made horrid horrid things, horrid things. Which were against our culture, against anything that is good. And then I would sensor it out, this is gone, this is gone, this is gone. And then they could manage to get it back because they use to bribe some people or somebody I don’t know. They would have another show, another show and get all the filth into it. I was on the sensor board you see. Sensor board is the censorship where they cut it.

Because their investment is quite a lot. And they want to make that money out and it has to be appeal the baser self of human beings. So they could extract money. So they didn’t mind bribing any amount for that. But the Indian films are where the families., or the whole family has to go. So such films a father wouldn’t see with his daughter and things like that. So they were not very clean films. And started declining very much. And a new organization came which started making films which were sensible. And very nice sensible films were now produced in India. Do you have a some of these like Shrikanth and all that? This film Shrikanth is written by Sarat Chandra. Means, Sarat Chandra, I regard him as one of the best writers of novels. But it is only Indian poor sort of, smooth, sweet and very delicate relationships and all. But this one has done by Srikanth, where he describes four types of women. How loving and kind they are. A very good film has been made out of that. Anything like that if he sees he will know quality that’s come up. That’s what I am saying. You can send it to him. Even now there are such nice films in India produced very nice, very good quality and beautiful but only thing is that somebody has to do the dubbing on to that. Say supposing if you do it in English, you can have subtitles and that can give you the new trend that has started is to make films more on the spirit more on the love which is pure. Very soothing and very beautiful. That’s not too much of beating violence nothing. Very soothing soothes you down, Hindi - aap ye Srikanth dekha hai? kya film: Did you see the movie Srikanth? what a movie. This kind of film we have, I would like you to see them first for yourself and then you will see how soothing it is. It's very soothing.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, he also told which is very good, that basically, normally he can not bow to any guru, false guru I would say.

Shri Mataji: It's very good. That’s something thank God for that. I should tell them, you should not bow to me also to begin with. What I have done? First you get your realization then you understand what I am. Then you can bow. Before that why? Blind faith. So by blind faith you can not understand God.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, he is saying is that in his eyes he is honouring absolute the self in each human being.

Shri Mataji: Of course he should. But that self, you have to discover within yourself in full way and in others also in a full way. There was a poet in India Namadeva and he went to see another saint. His name was Gorah, but he was a potter. And Namadeva was a tailor. So the tailor went to see the potter. And as soon as he saw him, his heart was so filled with joy. What he says is that, in Marathi he says, that I came here to see the formless, the vibrations he meant. But I see the formless in the form. That’s you. Hindi - Batayatha, Aliya Marathi mein hain.  Then Namadeva went to GuruNanak in the North in Punjab. Immediately Gurunanak knew he was a saint. He said, now you settle down with me. You have to make poems in Punjabi. He must study Punjabi then he made such a big book out of Punjabi language. And all those six now in their guru Granth sahib got his writings and they pray to him. So, you see, a saint can only understand the saint. And they say the same thing. Whether they are in England, whether they are in Japan or they are in Lebanon. Like we have Khalil Gibran, he was from Lebanon. And he was talking about Paul. He has written a chapter. This strange fellow Paul God knows how he is in the Bible and who has put him there he is such a man, he doesn’t know what he is saying what he is doing. Criticism. Complete. And when I saw him in the Bible, Paul, I asked my father, he is also a realized soul. I said who is this Paul? What is he doing there? So my father said “I think somebody who has illegally gone into this”. So, you see, if you are a realized soul, you can understand who is the real and who is not the real, whom to bow, whom not to bow.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, when he had this special condition, he also trying to hear the intuition of his voice, he understood that it was said to him that there is no duality there is good and there is bad but both are one thing they are together since then it makes him a lot of difficulties, it means also he should not charge the people.

Shri Mataji: It is meant for the people who are not realized. But not for people who are realized. Suppose if he have no eyes, how can he tell you about colours.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, what really happened to him? Unclear() was it a clearance?

Shri Mataji: He went to Bali, and Bali is a place long time back Sita was carried on by Jatayu. Ravana was carrying and Jatayu was the bird which fought Ravana. He fought. And then there were tears falling from the eyes of Sita Ji. And that’s how the Bali became such a beautiful thing. All description is in the Ramayana. So, Sita is Mahalakshmi, that’s why he got into this. So he was sensitive enough.

He knows, He knows. He talks to me in German and talks to me. That’s how we have little laughter.

It's such a fun. Hindi - Unclear() peth bhar gaya, wo Kya hai? Desert? nahi? what is the desert?

Yogi: Ice cream Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Alright, little bit.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, since yesterday when we found each other, he was on the way to you, he has a pressure in his centre heart.

Shri Mataji: Alright, I have to clear it now.

So, in the land of Bali, the whole, it's very vibrated. But the tourists have spoiled that place very much. So, I have not been so far. But I know about it very well.

Another Yogi: There are people Sahaja yogis living in Bali now.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, there are Sahaja yoga people living, you should get the address.

Yogi: There is a lady who is a yoga teacher Mother, Hatha yoga teacher

Shri Mataji: From where?

Yogi: In one of the major complexes there. I think the Kabaneri, she is there.

Shri Mataji: From Australia?

Yogi: I am not sure where she came from, she is resident there, she takes us classes and she got it from one of the Sahaja yogi source holidaying there.

Yogi: Shri Mataji that’s very interesting, what he is saying because he also was there. Maybe he got it from there.

Shri Mataji: I think as the SahajaYogis are so many increasing so many catalysts are there, and it acts as a catalyst I think. Because you are so many increasing in number and the vibration is there and it's all charged. So anybody can be caught into it and just like you have spacecraft, in the same way the illusion has also taken place. At first one cylinder goes up to a point with a certain velocity and it explodes and then the second one is thrown up, velocity is increased and the third one like that. So in the same way this SahajaYoga will also work in the same way. Because now we are so many that there will a combustion there will be many. It started with one person, now today SahajaYoga is working in 30 Nations. What did you say for thirty? I mean in your language what do you say?

Yogi: Dreissig

Shri Mataji: We say tees, we say tees.

Yogi: What he is asking Shri Mataji, from whom he got this text about the impossibility of time, he was somehow getting to know his thoughts he is asking from where did it come from.

Shri Mataji: Not from the divine, all over, it is a subtle way. You see, that is, whatever is unconscious is outside as well as within ourselves and when we become realize it you start feeling it you see. So you become conscious. And I have recently in this thing I have given lecture about paramachaitanya, about all this all-pervading power. And that’s how you see, you have seen my photographs in the sky and all these things happening through that. So how I have explain it to you very clearly that everything is inside that, like an ocean. And sometimes it goes into the folds of a wave or maybe. So we think it's not there. When you come up you see everything acting. You know, it guides you all the time, especially Sahaja Yogis, see now these were coming to know that what happened. They came late these swiss people and I told them that I will take time, I will come for puja later was postponing. So they didn’t understand some people have to come. They didn’t understand and then these people sat in the taxi came all the way I mean to come to Pune. And instead of going to my house, they came to the place of where we were Biba.

And what about you then, he met he was to come and he met the same taxi fellow, same one. And he brought him so far away into a jungle we were someplace. He just brought him down there. So you see this is-

Yogi: Shri Mataji, it’s very nice question. He is not always sure if it is the absolute or it might be his ego and in the case then he also had to see, he should support his movement that he makes a video, spread it to video shops so all people can get it, he would like to know whether it was absolute or it was just his ego.

Shri Mataji : You see, I can see one of the victims of the new explosion. Now these people started form the scratch you see, so it was alright. But suddenly exploded and threw him out like that, so he doesn’t know where he lands. So its alright, it doesn’t matter.. So now you will know from them everything I mean whatever you have missed so far. I mean you have reached a state which is very good for you.

Hindi - Unhone khana kale? Khana khalo

Hello none of them had any lunch, I thought they must have had.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, they all had.

They had? only she didn’t have, you didn’t have. You did not have. Alright. What about him? Did he have? Did you have? Did you have something to eat?

He is an interesting, now there will be many like this I think. Yours was a hard way I must say, yours was a hard way no doubt.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, he was saying, since this happened to him, he doesn’t smoke anymore, he doesn’t drink anymore, he doesn’t like meat very much.

Shri Mataji: Blasted now. What is he saying?

Yogi: Only one thing Shri Mataji, he could not follow. Which his inner voice was also telling him, he should from now on stay without the wife..

Shri Mataji: That he should?

Yogi: That he should stay without the women relations. Which he could not follow yet.

Shri Mataji: Ya ya, you see, you must get married. You see there is, the sanity part of it is there, that we have to marry, we have to have children who are realized souls on this earth, they are seeking such parents. Hindi - Khana khavo? kya kar rahe ho? Khana kha? Khaya tha? Kha

Hindi - Kya keha rahe?

Yogi: Shri Mataji, what he is saying, that he also knows from inside, from a plan that in the  next maybe twenty years not to be precise, we will all be converted into new consciousness Unclear()

Shri Mataji: We have already, you will met so many of them. Not only that -

Yogi: What he would like to know Shri Mataji, let this conversion takes place what effect it will have on the physical body.

Shri Mataji: Oooh he improved so much, physically

Yogi: what will happen after such a evolved person is dying

Shri Mataji: Dying?

Yogi: Yeah, physically dying I would say.

Shri Mataji: He will become fragrance what else?

Aliya, be careful, you might get hurt.

Yogini: Shri Mataji, the question was a different one. When this time comes where the consciousness of human beings change and they get to the level of thoughtlessness. For these people when they die what happens? Do they get into a very subtle body and this appear in the universal unconscious or will they come back again? or do we stay here in this subtler form?

Shri Mataji: See, it will be a matter of your own choice, you can do whatever, whichever you want to do. But you would like to help other people. So, the way you want to live, you live. There wont be anybody controlling you or telling which just your own freedom.

Yogi: Karma is finished.

Shri Mataji:  Karma is finished of course. It won't be any karmas, actually now they are finished. Karmas are already finished. See, Alisa, your own decision would be normally to come back in some form. Maybe the subtler form, maybe the gross form to help the people. Germans would like to help Germans. Because you see, there are English they won't be able to speak german. So it would be better  Germans are born as Germans and look after them.

Yogini: Shri Mataji, his main concern is what happens after physical death or in this the particular case what he meant. Is it possible for human beings that the physical body gets refined and gradually reaches a level as subtle level.

Shri Mataji: Not after death. No no. After death only out of the five elements, two elements completely dropout. The physical body has got five elements you see, out of, two elements drop out. One of them is the  ‘Pruthvi Tatva’ is the element of the Mother Earth, and another is the ‘Jala Tatva’ - element of water. These two drops out. But the soul remains. Nothing dies.

Shri Mataji: I will go now.

Yogini: His question was actually Shri Mataji, Apparently, he has gone to many gurus. Either they didn’t give him any answer or they said there is not such a thing that you can not get the physical body to the entire vibratory level..

Shri Mataji: Just now you will get it. Just now. You see these gurus are impostures. They are not real, they are sitting in the marketplace. You must see from the disciples.

Yogi: There is a Indian guru called babaji

Shri Mataji: Useless fellow, nothing, I have seen his disciples.

Yogini: In India, Apparently there was a guru called baba ji,

Shri Mataji: I know I know

Yogini: Who dissolved his body into,

Shri Mataji: All, All, Unclear(what, heard) all stories. Because, you know you must see from the disciples. Have they got vibratory awareness? They haven’t.

And if you talk to them, you will find out that they are nothing. You see, I am a mother so I will say that alright, what has your guru given you?

That’s it. That’s all. That’s all. So you have to ask what have they given. And we had some gurus, sadgurus we had. No doubt. You had them, you had. But also you will know when you will know. very well, when you have your vibratory awareness you will immediately know. Then you can judge. Because this gives you the full idea about the absolute. But in any case I am very happy to meet you, I must tell you one reason this explosion has started and I see the first victim. Because you all had to go through a hard way. Now this explosion is a very good idea.

So it’s a good symptom. Because these people had gone through a very hard ways, you see. These people had to come to SahajaYoga through a very hard way.

Alright, so you are a lucky one that way. But still you have to know all these things.
