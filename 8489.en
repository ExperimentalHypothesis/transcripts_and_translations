“Organisation of Sahaja Yoga in England” Chelsham Road, 10th May 1980

...A personality that everybody wants to follow, to become, to love. This would be very selfish to say that, “I am enjoying!” It’s something very funny. You see, some people are like that: self-certificated; again I call them. “Oh, I’m enjoying myself, I have no problems, you see, why should you worry?" This is all nonsense, absolute nonsense it is. It is that you are enjoying your ego then. But to enjoy yourself means you are enjoying everyone and everybody’s enjoying you; everybody likes you. You are not extreme neither too ritualistic. You are so flexible. You are adjustable. That’s like water, whatever you mix it with, it takes the colour. However you put it, it washes. If it appears in the eyes it makes you look beautiful. It’s like that. That’s the spiritual quality of a person. They have to be adjustable. In whatever way you are, people enjoy you and love you.

Vibrations have improved. Alright?

Don’t blame anyone for anything, not yourself [or] anyone. Enjoy! This is the time for enjoyment, not for blaming others, sitting down, sulking. No it’s for enjoyment.

Good. Beautiful! Are you alright now?

Good. Now put your hand towards me. Alright? Put your hands towards me straight.

Be alert! Some people need alertness. Be alert!

Look at children, how alert they are. When there’s an aeroplane going, they’ll all come and, "Bye-bye aeroplane, bye-bye aeroplane!" Now the aeroplane is gone, so that work is over. Then they come inside. Then they see something else then get into it.. You see, to them the whole world is their responsibility. The aeroplane is going: somebody must say bye-bye to the aeroplane! (Laughter) So all of them will come out and say, "Bye-bye, bye-bye!" And then they’ll come inside the house and then they’ll get very seriously involved into something else they were doing. Then they’ll pull out this and pull out that; put everything together. And whatever it is, you may call it a mess, but according to them they are constructing everything. They’re responsible for the whole world, you know!

If they are realised-souls they are even greater. Every time they say something it’s so remarkable that really, the way they take attitudes towards things. Like this time, at my elder [granddaughter] Aradana came up to me and she said, “Did You ever study a very nonsensical subject called moral science?” I said, “No, never.” “You see, it is such a stupid subject nani, that you need not study at all. It’s horrible!” I said, “What do they teach you?” “They teach you ‘don’t steal! Now, do we steal? Are we servants or what? Why should we steal? Are we thieves? That’s tell us don‘t tell lies. Why should we tell lies?” So they are realised-souls, they can’t understand. They can’t understand, can you cunningness and all that. They said, “Why should they teach us like this? What is the need? I mean, everybody knows!” You see, it is like teaching somebody that food is good for your stomach, or something like that. According to them it is so essential. I mean, it is so much there, what is there to tell them. “This is a stupid subject of moral science!”

So I said, “Alright, but supposing you have to deal with criminals, then you have to tell them, isn’t it? What is to be done and what is not to be done. So if you become teachers tomorrow you will have to tell criminals: ‘Don’t do it this.’” So the younger one says, “By telling anybody, do you think they’ll be alright? They‘ll punch your noses!” (laughter) The younger one, Anupama ‘aunty’!

She said, “They‘ll punch your noses! No use telling them. It’s useless to tell them, ‘Don’t do, don’t do.’ They’re will do it. If you say, ‘Don’t kill.’, they’ll kill you, immediately!” So they said, “You should give them Realisation otherwise they will never listen to you, because how will they know that killing is bad?” “Because if you have vibrations,” this elder one tells me, “then you will know that you are losing vibrations, if you do like that, but otherwise how will they know?” See, look at that.

I said, “But still supposing there are criminals, what should we do about them? If there are murderers, what should we do?" “They should be destroyed, no question!” I said, “Really?” See the other side of a person. I said, “Do you think that?” “If they do not want to take Realisation, they must be destroyed. If they want to take Realisation, well and good. Otherwise they have to be destroyed!” I say, “How do you destroy them?” So the younger one says, “All right, put them in the fishpond!” (laughter). So the elder one says, “But the fishes will be ruined. Think of the fishes! How can you put them to the fishes?” So the elder one says, “All right, is there any serpents who can devour people?” So I said, “There are serpents. But then, what about the serpents. They are already serpents. So these serpents can go to serpents, makes no difference, you see." So, I said then, “What do you do?” “You get a serpent,” they said, “Fix it to a machine. Machine is the best! Fix it to a machine. Keep the mouth wide open. Don’t touch them! Just shove them inside!” (laughter) “Because if you touch them, you will be spoiled.”

You see, without any fear of any kind of violence - so innocently. “And then, when they become serpents, they will learn. Then they will come back. Then they’ll be better off and you can give them Realisation. Otherwise they have to become serpents.”

You see, simple solutions. “But you don’t touch them. Nobody should touch them, they are serpents. No use teaching such stupid subjects like, ‘Don’t do, don’t do!’ It’s no good.”

I mean, these must be the saints of ancient times who must have realised that Ten Commandments is not going to help this human beings. You need a better way of doing it. This is what it is, I think. So their way of thinking and their styles are very different.

Like Anand, I must tell you about Anand. He said that, “How is it that people don’t realise that Anukampa is..." – Anukampa is a very special Sanskrit word. It is said that he’ll become a great Sanskrit scholar, you see. He tops the list to the class and nobody knows how he does that, you see. Very clever. So, I said, “What did you say?” He said, “The God has His Anukampa. His grace. Everywhere spread. People don‘t know that. Do You know nani, they don’t know that there is grace everywhere. There’s something like God’s grace everywhere. There are many people who do not know. What can you do about these people?” This is Mr. Anand asking me this. “How can you solve this problem to make people know that there is grace of God all around us?” But if I tell him, that there are many Sahaj Yogis who do not know, he’ll be shocked! I said, “I am surprised that people do not know that God’s grace exists everywhere.” What a Realisation!

And a person who was not getting Realisation, he was on my feet, you see. So he (Anand) went and brought one of my garlands and put it in his pant, like that. I said, “What are you doing?” He said, “I’m decorating the Kundalini.” And the Kundalini shot off! It shot off just like that! He worshipped it. He worshipped his Kundalini. And the Kundalini shot off like that. And then he took back the garland, washed it, and put it back. What a sense!

They are all coming up now.

Now this one point is, we have to form a brain trust. Somebody should write it down.

Then there is another possibility of our spreading Sahaj Yoga is this, that there are two great artists coming from India, who are Sahaj Yogis, who would like to have my photograph for their programme and who would like to talk about Sahaj Yoga a little bit and about me also, praising me, or something like that. And we can organise their programmes in some halls and we pay them part of the money and you can keep part of the money for Sahaj Yog. We can do it. There are two artists coming, so you have to write to Venugopalan. Somebody has to telephone to Venugopalan and get, Pandit Jasraj is one of them, whom you like very much. Do you have the record of Pandit Jasraj here? Do you have his record? No? Sure? All right. I have got one.

He’s very good at bhajans, no doubt. He’s very good at bhajans. But he sings beautifully classical music. So for all Sahaj Yogis it should be a classical music programme. In Caxton Hall we can have. We should have a little money paid for him and we can give him part of the money. Or we can give the whole of it from our side. But in any other thing [if] you want to have programme, for example I was thinking, if you can write to people of certain organisations who would like to have bhajan programmes, like Crawley people might like to have. Or some places which we can save.

Then we have got this fellow Parag Rajan. He’s another person who can be contacted. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and all these places. He’s a great bhajan singer. We can organise that. And we can get the proceeds and we can get part of the proceeds. We can have tickets and things. We can organise it. But this has to be done in June.

We have so many people, we can do this.

Now this is for the person who sings classical and the bhajans. And the bhajans will be more accepted by Indian communities. For example, near Birmingham we have got this Vyas, you can talk to him. He can organise one programme there. But the dates you must get.

Now there’s another one whom you have heard, that sitarist. Do you remember? Debu. Debu Chaudhari. You just find out from Mr. Venugopalan. Somebody has to find out from Venugopalan, when are they coming. Debu Chauduri is a very famous, very, very famous artist from India. He’s something like at par with others like Ravi Shankar and all that, but he’s not so much accepted, so far. I mean, his name is not so much spread out. But what we can do is to arrange his programme, but for English audiences it will be perfectly alright because he plays sitar.

So [for] these two things, somebody has to make a committee and to find out where you can take them, what you can do. And then the money can be collected also. Every programme you can collect about a hundred pounds at least, minimum. Wherever you want to: say [in] Brighton you can have a programme. You can have it at every place. Wherever there has been Indian music, or anything, you can start it, or wherever they want to have it. Indian music is nowadays appreciated. One of them is a sitarist and another one is a vocalist. And for vocalist you should try more Indian audience than this. You should find out. I have asked somebody to give me the addresses. But try to get more addresses from Indian organisations. And also you can contact I.P Singh and all these people to say that we are organising such a programme, would you like to have one in the high commission. Get some addresses from Mrs. I.P. Singh.

So Gavin you [must] sit down, make a list of things that are to be done. Get a few people who are interested in doing this. We can earn money out of it because they would like to give money for Sahaj Yog. And it would be a very fair thing because we’ll be organising it. But you have to do it in a better way. You see, he’s not a hocus pocus like the one we had last time. But we have to really work it out. First advertise it in Caxton Hall and then later on.

You see, we should tell them to play really ragas and not some sort of a, you see they try to please the Indian audience by playing some sort of a cheap music or something. You should say that, “You should really play pure ragas.” And there then we can work out our Realisation also in such programmes. And could be a good advertisement because if the Sahaj Yogis are singing...and also he can, this fellow who is a musician coming from India who sings, if he could sing, you ask Venugopalan if he can sing some songs with Mother’s name there then we are interested, some bhajans with my name. He sings bhajans to the Kali, but he should take Mother’s name in between. So if you can write to him, tomorrow, a letter, you might get that “this is what we want”. And also the other fellow, Debu, who is coming from there: if he could say something about Sahaj Yoga; that he has gained so much in Sahaj Yoga. So that it’s an advertisement also. What I am saying [is that], apart from money, it’s advertisements.

So the whole thing we’ll organise in praise of Mother. If they are willing to do it, we are willing to do it here. You see, it has to be helping the Sahaj Yoga, that’s all. So you write to him tomorrow a letter, suggesting that this is what we have decided, we have a committee here now [that] Mother has formed. We would like to know exactly what nights they are going to spend there, when they are going to come. We’ll do all the expense of advertisement and selling of tickets and all that, and part of the money we’ll keep for Sahaj Yog, very little part, most of it we’ll give it to him. But the main thing is they should advertise Sahaj Yoga, among Indian communities and things like that.

Now this Jasraj who is such a great...have you heard him, Jasraj? No? He’s a very famous artist, very famous. Alright I’ll send you his things. But he sings beautifully, beautifully. He doesn’t drink, doesn’t smoke and he leads a very good righteous life. And you should say we’ll give all the publicity he wants, but it should be done for the sake of Sahaj Yog otherwise we are not interested. We are not interested in the artists but we are interested in Sahaj Yoga. And as a support to Sahaj Yoga, if they are coming here, we’ll get the money for them alright. But the main thing is they have to support Sahaj Yoga. Alright? So tomorrow you write a letter to him.

Yogi: Where are they they going to stay?

Shri Mataji:Ah?

Yogi: Where will they stay?

Shri Mataji: Oh they’ll arrange their own stay and all that. You don’t have to bother about them. Also you ask, “Have they arranged for their stay?” I think they have arranged their stay and all that, mostly. They have not asked me to arrange for their stay or anything. But in case they have not then we’ll see about it. But we’ll see now what to do with them. But you just ask, “What about their stay, where will they be?” You see, they are already invited by some other people, so we are only interested in arranging their programme. So why to put also ideas? We should say, “Where will they be staying? We would like to know their address,” and all that so that there’s no problem. They are quite well to do people, I mean, they don’t have a problem of money. And nowadays in India you can purchase foreign exchange, and you can live here.

Third thing is, Alan, I want to see you tomorrow morning. Where is he? Alan? Did you find the angle of the thing?

Alan: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Then can you bring that drawing and let’s see tomorrow if you can come morning time, I’ll tell you what is to be done. Hmm?

Now about our programme in London and outside. Tomorrow have you advertised it? Alright.

Now every monday we’ll be having it in London for all these days. I’ll be quite free from  Monday onward this week. And every day I would like to meet three or four of you personally, either in the ashram or there. For about two or three days, till Wednesday morning. Or you can find ten people or something, a group like that so that Monday or Tuesday I can meet you if you want. Or if you want I can come here and talk to them personally. You see, I must see to you individually. Alright?

So Monday and Tuesday I’m definitely available. As we are having [Caxton Hall] meeting on Monday we can have some sort of an after Monday session, if you like, after the meeting. With few of us you can come to my house and you can talk to someone. Or form these committees if you want to. Or we can meet on Monday and let’s see what you have done about it. Two or three committees are to be formed: first for the programmes in London, another [for the] programmes outside. Then for the programmes of these people coming in. And fourth for the publicity. All these committees should be formed. We can have two meetings. Monday meeting after the programme, and Tuesday. If in my house or here, wherever you say, I am willing to come. Alright?

Now those who want to give their names for the committee, you must give your names also. Programme outside means you have to take me out, you have to go beforehand and establish and then I join. Now I have decided not to go by car because it’s too much for me. I’ll go by train because I don’t want to exert myself so much because then I have to go to America. You see, mine is like a marathon! Your’s is a relay! I have been so very busy in Australia, then in India, then I am back here. Not one day I rested in India: horrible it was! Then I am here, again I am running about. I don’t mind going to any place but it should be once going out in one week: once only. Not that I’m travelling throughout like that. And I’ll go by train. If you can’t afford it I will afford it. But I will not like to exert myself too much. Alright?

So first you have to establish there, then I’ll go. Not that I’ll establish it. It’s better you go and establish something; advertise, have a meeting, talk to people. Take four, five people, who should form a group of people.

Now the holidays are there, those who want to take advantage of the holidays can do it. What about your [housing] co-op, what’s happening about it?

Jason: We’ve asked several associations and councils for houses and we’ve had some very interesting promises so far Mother.

Shri Mataji: Really? Good! What’s that?

Jason: Some associations say they’re going to give us some houses when they know what their programme looks like.

Shri Mataji: Which associations are these? Private?

Jason: Er, no charitable Mother.

Shri Mataji: Oh I see. So they have some houses here?

Jason: Yeah there’s some houses Mother.

Shri Mataji: You have seen some.

Jason: I’ve seen some that we might be able to get, yes, but it’s not definite yet.

Shri Mataji: Where is it?

Jason: Notting Hill.

Shri Mataji: Notting Hill is very beautiful. But it’s in the Notting Hill area or somewhere? It should not be in dangerously placed areas you see, where there is danger. Because I don’t want to put you into places where you could be harmed, because negativity when it starts it can be...I mean, where there is a labour class thing, where conflicts of labour and all that, I don’t think you should go there. But if it is something in between it’s alright. But where absolutely rugged people live, they get into tempers for nothing at all and then negativity works through them: very rugged, or over sophisticated is just the same. If they are over sophisticated they are also gone cases. Then they know how to hide all their sins in their sophistication. It should be something in between. Overly rich, over-ly rich.

Yogi:  We are looking at lots of areas though Mother. So it could be a good area it could be an in between area.

Shri Mataji: You see for yourself. Alright? Good vibrations and things, will be a good idea. I’m very happy if it is working out . It was your idea Jason and if it works out it will be great, really. We have to have. And then we’ll have, Notting Hill, now what are you doing in this area? You better put up here something, Sahaja Yoga centre or something, if they allow, if this is a freehold house, and start attracting people here in this area. You go round in the...you can talk to them, meet them. Even they are selling, these days, I have seen some soaps, people come into your house and tell you about some soap or something. Suddenly you find somebody is coming inside, “I want to sell this soap.” Then some tell you, “We are selling this kind of windows.” (laughing) So why not we do something about selling Sahaj Yoga without taking any money? Is there any word for doing like that? Selling without taking any money? Is there any word in English language?

Yogis: Giving.

Shri Mataji: Giving. But giving can be quite challenging. People might feel, “Who is he to give? I’m the lord of the whole world!” Find out something. Supplying. Supplying maybe. I don’t know. A nice word you should find out. If you say, “I’m giving you enlightenment,” they say, “Oh you are great! What do you think of yourself!” (laughter)

Try to find out. Must be there are some poetic words.  What do you say Don, with all the studies you are making? (laughing) Are there some gracious words?

Don: It’s not a very gracious language.

Shri Mataji: Gracious?

Yogi: It’s not a very gracious language.

Shri Mataji: Aaaah! You know, every Sahaj Yogi will have to learn English. That way I’m speaking for England. And Marathi, maybe some other. So everybody has to learn English. Poor things these two girls who came from France, they wanted to talk to me, they couldn’t talk. But I can’t learn twenty-one languages. So I had to tell them, “You’d better learn English.” All of them are, poor things, learning English. But even Raol Bai had to learn English. Yes! Raol Bai, poor thing, trying to learn English. She said, “First of all, I must learn to say sorry!” “But you may say sorry at the time when you have to say thank you.” “Yes,” she said, “that I have to remember!” She said, “People then complained that, ‘Give her anything, she doesn’t say thank you!’” I said, “You forgot to say thank you!” She said, “But she gave me just some food to eat. Am I to say thank you then?” I said, “Yes! You have to say for everything! If she gives you food then it’s an even greater thank you!” So she said, “Alright, greater thank you!” (laughter)

You see, the whole idea is different. Now in India, if you offer somebody the food, then the person who takes is obliging. See the juxtaposition of the whole thing
