Interpreter: Do you hear the speech of Shri Mataji?

Audience:  Yes, Yes

Shri Mataji: Can you hear me?Sahaja Yogis: yes.  Shri Mataji: I bow to all seekers of truth! We have to know that the truth is what it is.You can not change it, you can not transform it, you can not describe it.  And you can not pay for it.  In every religion it is said that you have to find yourself, especially in Koran it’s written that if you do not know yourself, you are not a human being. All “Namaz” and all those prayers are just to ascend, to know yourself.  In every religion, it is said so.  But as you know the religions have become now power-oriented and money-oriented.  And in the name of god they all are fighting.So people saying that there is no truth in God.  But the time has come to prove the existence of God and oneness, unity of all the religions.  There is nothing to fight in the name of God.  Actually, they are not fighting for the truth but fighting for money, for land or for some power.Dr.  Khan has already told you, what do we have within our self  or also in Kuran, this Kundalini is described as 'asas' [base, foundation]. and also this All-pervading Power of divine love is described as “Ruh”.  

Names may be different but they all talk of the same thing. You can not call any religion, as exclusive.  Mohammad sahib is the one who talked about Abraham, about Moses, about Christ and His mother.  especially about Christ’s Mother, he said you should never challenge her chastity.  Even in the bible, she is not so much respected as he respected.  That shows that we must respect our women. Every religion has gone into some sort of a perversion and has become the fundamentalist. Where there are priests or everything or a kind of a “peer” and hatred for each other.  If God is ‘Rahim’ (very merciful) and ‘Rahman’ (feel pity for every living thing) how can we have hatred.  You must understand that the divine power is there to construct us, to guide us, and to lead us to patience.  They are living in this modern world which is so Chaotic.  And all over the world, you will find people are just trusted.  All the truthful people are trying to find out the solution.  

In these special modern times also there is one blessing which is spreading that, people will know themselves. Which was the idea of Mohammad Sahib also. Especially, your country has been blessed by a very great soul like Atatürk Kemal Paşa. And in this country, you have had so many Sufis of very great evidence.Like Yunus Emre.  If you read his poetry you will be amazed to know that your country has such beautiful poets and such truthful people.  He was such a great spiritual soul, and the way he has described about the human beings is really so loving, so compassionate.   He has talked of nothing but love.  He says I have one enemy that is the hatred and I have one friend that is love.  It is really remarkable, how such a great soul is in this country, Turkey and it’s blessings will always be with you.  I was really very much attracted to your country because so many Sufis have been created here and their praises are sung even in India. There is nothing to learn from others.  You have such trained people who have done so much service to your country as far as spirituality is concerned.  When we say this is my hand, this is my body, this is my intelligence who is the owner of this.  All this you see, these are the channels which look after your autonomous nervous system.  As intelligent people, you should ask a question who is this “auto”.  Science is very limited and also immoral.  There is no morality about science. For example, they can make atom bombs, they can make all kinds of destructive weapons, there is no restrictive power in Science.And so you find that they have created machinery and the machines are creating lots of pollution.  And the whole world today is afraid of this pollution which will come and can destroy our world.So is there a solution for this? For the protection of human beings.  There is, a way of becoming the self, the spirit that you develop by divinity to all these circumstances that are around you.It is the becoming that is important, now in our evolutionary process.We have now reached the stage which we called as the human stage but this stage is not perfect.  We do not have absolute knowledge, for example one think that capitalism is good, one think that communism is good, everybody has there own idea.Also, we have fixed ideas, like Hitler had the fixed idea that he was the one who has to kill the Jews.  Also, he felt that the Germans were the highest race. As a result, he thought he is alright in thinking to arrest the rest of them. Even today there are people, many people, who are at the helm of affairs and have fixed ideas.

But if you know what is the absolute truth and if you know there is a divine powerwhich guides our life, nourishes us, then the whole thing changes.Now, Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations.  And we get people from these 65 nations,  in India in thousands.  Here also, people have also come from other countries to help other Sahaj yogis here. But there is no quarrel, no fight, nothing.  They are enjoying their life.  And they have a purpose in life now.  All the bad habits, destructive habits like drugs, alcohol, all these things just drop out.One does not have to tell them, don’t do this, don’t do that.  Automatically they drop.In the `light of your spirit, you see what is destructive for you and you just give up, you just give it out understanding that it is very, something very dangerous for you.  Also, you get your powers, by which you give up everything that is wrong.  You get powers to give self-realisations to others also.  So one person can give realisation to 1000 people. Your health improves and all kinds of incurable diseases have been cured by Sahaja Yoga.There are 3 doctors in India who have got their M. D in Sahaja yoga for curing incurable diseases.For that, you don’t have to study medicine.  On your fingertips, you can feel the centres who are in jeopardy.  And you.  If you know how to cure yourself you can also cure others.  Because you develop the new dimension in your awareness.  That we call as collective consciousness. Sitting down here you can feel the centres of other people all over the world.  Also, those who are dead you can find out what sort of people they were.  Most important thing is that, we have to become the spirit because that is something indistinguishable.  All the problems of a human being can be solved.  It’s very important that today we should take to our self-hood, to our self-knowledge, for which we don’t have to pay.   You can not pay for it. You can not organize.  You have no organisation as such.  Individually you have to grow. So you rise above, the time, above all your defects and you become a supreme personality.Every day I am giving lectures, so my throat is out of order.  This time alright!Our life today, seems to be in real jeopardy.  Today for the first time I wanted to listen to the news in the morning.  I never listen to the news in the morning.  It’s horrible. And it was so shocking.  Everywhere in the world, something is going on.  you see.   Which is really unbearable.And when you see all that you feel that there is something must be done about it and that is to be done by the people who achieve their self-realisation because you don’t know who you are? You are the epitome of the evolution.  

Interpreter: I don’t understand, sorry,

The epitome of the human evolution means the highest. Now the last breakthrough is very simple.  It’s your own power. It’s your own mother. She does it all.  And when it happens you feel from the top of the head cool breeze like “Ruh” coming out and you become “Ruhani” (spirituel person).  Nobody has to certify you know yourself and you are amazed that you yourself become so fantastic. But you are that! You are born to be that and it has to happen.  There is no end to my lecture because I have been talking about it in every country I have been but it works and there is no end to your energy.  You must be knowing that I am 73 years of age.  I am 73 years old and praticly every third day I traveling a country but I feel very energetic and it works so well I have seen that people who are seekers some or other nature I think it’s all organised by this Ruhani power.  Thus,  you become religious, you become righteous.  There is no hypocrisy about it.  My husband told me that Turkish people are very  capable people and I find that, they are such great artist,they are so creative, everything is there but the only thing this has to happen so that you become great Sufi’s.  This is very simple and you can work it out just now. of course, I cannot force on you. You have to ask for it.  If you do not desire, I can not force on you, because this is the power of pure desire.  If you have the desire to become the self, it is very simple because only this power has to rise and pierce through your fontanel bone area become one with this all-pervading power.Sahaja means born with you.  It’s the right that you become one with this all-pervading power.  This is a union.  This is yoga for which you don’t have to stand on your head do anything.  It’s just there.  So, the only thing it has to work out.  Now, you see there are so many beautiful lights here, but only one switch to can put on the whole because they are just switches.  In the same way, you can get your enlightenment because that’s the built-in system within you like this. In every country, they have talked about this.  In every religion, they have talked about this. So one has to just get to it.  It will not take more than 10 minutes but those who want to go, should leave the hall because it can not be forced and those who do not want should please leave because others should not be disturbed in receiving.

Of course, There are very simple 3 conditions:First one is that you have to forgive yourself.You should not feel guilty about it at this moment.Because whatever wrong you have done is a past, so why you carry this myth on your head all the time.  Actually, by feeling guilty this centre is caught up here very much.  You all have it very much so that’s why I am coughing. But if this centre is very much caught up, then what happens is that you develop spondylitis.  You can also have a disease called angina by which you get a heart attack or else you can also have a very lethargic organ.  So why to feel guilty for nothing at all.So the second condition is to forgive others.  You have to forgive others, because -whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything.  But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.  So the best is to forgive, not to carry this myth.  So you forgive everyone, even without thinking about them that will really make you feel much lighter.Then the third condition is – that you have to take out your shoes which is not so difficult I think.  In London, the first time when I told them that take out your shoe half of them walked out.

Please take out your shoes.Some people feel that they are basically bad.Interpreter : She shouldn’t  take photograf during the session.Shri Mataji: Now, this time, why don’t you take your realisation? That is the best.  

Now, we will show you, how we have to nourish your centres with your own hand.

Left side that you have seen here, is what our mundane desires in day to day life.So please put your left hand on your lap or comfortably towards me. indicting that you desire it.Now believe me that you are all going to become the self, the spirit. Have faith yourself, like this.  No No like this.  Show it.  Alright!And the right hand is for the action.  So you put your right hand on your heart. Left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart. In the heart, resides your spirit.  If you become the spirit, you are your own guide. You are your own master.  So you put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side which is the centre of your mastery.

Then you take your hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left-hand side.  Please keep your left hand straight like this.  Now, this is the centre of pure knowledge that is divine.  Even you people do it, because you see there is nothing to ... attention, every person will realize. [unclear due to the mixing of voices]This is not to be repeated what I am saying.  Alright! Can you do it or not?Let us seek your peace.  It’s much better.

Alright!So Now this is the centre of pure divine knowledge.Now you have to raise your right hand on top of the upper part of the abdomen on the left-hand side.  You are nourishing your own centres.  Now put your right hand on the top of your heart.  

Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right.  Now I have already told you about this centre will go out of order if you feel guilty.

Now raise your right hand on the top of your forehead across and please put down your head.  This is the centre where you have to forgive others in general.Now, take back your hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible.  This is the centre where without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading power.  

Now, stretch your palm fully and this the is the last centre where you have to put your hand is the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood.  Now please push back your finger.  This is very important.  and put down your head.  Now here, you have to move your scalp.  Not your head, your scalp, carefully clockwise 7 times.  Just bend your heads.That’s all we have to do.  Now you have to close your eyes. Before that ,those who are sitting on the chair should put both the feet apart from each other.  Those who are on the ground are alright.All of you take out your glasses.  

No, no, you are alright, you are alright, you don’t have to, those who are sitting on the chairs because there are two powers.  Now please close your eyes and please don’t open them till I tell you.  Now left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart on the lap.Now in your heart, you have to ask a question about yourself.  a very fundamental one.You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji, here you say, in your heart 3 times.  Ask the question -Mother Am I the spirit?—-3 timesI have told you already that when you become the spirit.  You become your master.So now put your right hand on top of your abdomen on the left-hand side in the upper part and press it.  Here you have to ask another question which is fundamental.   Mother, Am I my own master? Now I can not force the pure divine knowledge on you.  You have to ask for it. So now please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it  and please ask 6 times  -Mother please give me pure divine knowledge.  Some of you are putting the left hand on the other way.  Please put it like this.  Some of you are putting wrong. Now Please ask six times -Mother please give me your pure divine knowledge.  Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.  As soon as you ask for the divine knowledge this power starts rising within you, so you have to open higher centres with self-confidence. So, here you ask or you can say with full self-confidence 10 times –“Mother I am my own master”. I must tell you, that you are not this body this mind, these emotions, these egos, these conditionings, but you are your own spirit.  

So now raise your right hand on your heart and here, you have to say with full self-confidence, 12 times –“ Mother I am the pure spirit”.

I have already told you that you should not feel guilty of your past.  Because this all-pervading power of love is the ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you might have committed will be completely dissolved by this power of forgiveness.  So please forgive yourself. And you rise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right.  Here now you have to say with full self-confidence 16 times –“Mother I am not guilty at all”.

I have already told you that whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything but if you don’t forgive then you play in the wrong hands and you torture yourself, especially at this moment.  It’s very important because the centre that is crossing of your optic chiasma is very constricted and if you don’t forgive, this power don’t rise through because this centre has to open. So, please take your right hand on the top of your forehead across and put down your head. Here you have to be humble and say from your heart – (not how many times ) “Mother I forgive everyone in general”.  Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading power.

So please take your right hand in the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible.  Here, you have to say (not how many times) but from your heart –“Oh Divine power! Oh, Ruhani power! Please forgive me if I have done anything wrong knowingly and unknowingly.”

Now the last most important centre is on top of your head.  Stretch your palm fully and press on the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood.  Now please push back your fingers, it’s very important because you have to have good pressure on your scalp. Now Please bend your head.  Here again I can not force self-realisation on you. so you have to ask for it. So move your scalp 7 times clockwise, saying –“Mother please give me my self-hood or self-realisation or my spirit.”  Takedown your hand and slowly open your eyes.  

Now, please put both your hands towards me like this. Now, put your right hand like this, bent your head and with the left hand, you see on top of your head if there any cool breeze or a hot breeze coming out of your own head.  Now please put your left hand.  And see with your right hand, if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Higher not on the top of the head, it can be very much higher also.  Just move and see.  If you are have not forgiven yourself or not forgiven others.  It will be hot here coming in.

Now, Put the right hand towards me and again see with your left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.  Now raise both the hands towards the sky and push back your head.  Here now you have to ask one question 3 times:Is this the all-pervading power of divine love that is called as “Ruh”.3 times ask “Mother, is this the all-pervading power of divine love which is called as Ruh”.Push back your head.  Now please take down your hand. Now put both the hands towards me like this.  And watch me without thinking because this is what happens that you become thoughtlessly aware.You come to your present.  You stand in your present.  Please put both the hands.  All those who have felt the cool or hot breeze on the fingers, on the palm or on the top of the fontanel bone area Please raise your both handsLook at that! The whole of the Turkey has got it!May God bless you !May God bless you !I bow you all, Now your saintly life has started.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
