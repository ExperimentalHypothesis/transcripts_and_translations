Advice to sahaja yogis, regarding self control, dedication and behavior. New Delhi (India), 11 March 1981.

YOU SHOULD BE LIKE A KING SITTING ON HIS THRONE. INSTEAD, YOU ARE SITTING ON THE THRONE AND WEEPING AND BEGGING! WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO SUCH FOOLISH PEOPLE? You are a king and you should order your five organs that you have been tolerating them and now they should behave. When you command yourself like this, bring yourself under control like this, then only you have become a good sahaj yogi. Otherwise, your mind goes somewhere and you say, “ Mother, what to do, I control my mind so much but still it goes there” Then, what is mind? It is a living force, it will go. Our organs will be awakened and we will never like to wander there, and we will give up many things.

AMONG ALL THE THINGS WE MUST REMEMBER ONLY ONE; KEEP OUR HEARTS CLEAN. THOSE PEOPLE WHOSE HEARTS ARE CLEAN HAVE VERY FEW PROBLEMS. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU ARE THINKING OF BAD THINGS. CLEAN HEART MEANS DEDICATION. YOU CANNOT GROW IN SAHAJ YOGA, IF YOU LACK IN DEDICATION, OR IF YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE SOME SPECIAL KIND OF PERSON. THERE IS NO NEED FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL OR BEING SOME LEARNED PERSON. YOU SAY, “MOTHER, I HAVE NOT FELT ANYTHING, I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE”. ITS DUE TO YOUR FAULT AND NOT THAT OF SAHAJ YOGA.
Sometimes, people talk to me as if I have taken some contract or they have paid money to me, “Mother we are coming to you for very long time.” However long you may come, you may come till you may become old, still you wont get anything. THAT’S WHY, IF YOU HAVE NOT GOT ANYTHING, IT SHOWS THAT YOU ARE LACKING IN SOMETHING. The moment you are separate from yourself, your faults will be immediately seen to you and as they are seen, you will feel as if you are a King on throne. If you find your subjects (senses and organs, ego and superego etc…) are creating disturbances, Order them, “ Be quiet, you will not do it” and not just in persuading way like, “ don’t do it” Only that person is powerful, who is keeping himself in full command!!

Let us take an example of how people talk. When they talk, even to me, they forget whom they are talking to. What they say is really surprising. They do not at all understand what should be said and what should not be. We must control even our tongue. It becomes possible, only after you become separate from yourself and watch. You have to be careful of what you say and see that it is all right. 
Slowly you will form new habits, new ways, you will make new judgments and then you will be able to order yourself, always as third person. A realized person never talks in first person. He tells himself, “ please go there, please sit down”, etc. generally children speak in third person, they say, “ Nirmala will not go now. She will stay here itself”. Sahaj yogis should also speak in this fashion.
Slowly, you should become separate from yourself. Leaving aside your desires, your materialistic ideas, or some other ideas, say, your ideas regarding power etc, YOU SHOULD ONLY THINK AS TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING FOR SAHAJ YOGA AND WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.
This dedication is very less in India, even now. It is much more in the West. They never come and request me to cure their relations. They never tell me their material difficulties and problems. You (Indians) get the realization very quickly and those people (Western), poor things, they take long time because of their mistakes. 

You get realization very fast but you don’t value it much. They are realized late, but they have great value for it. They know its worth. Just see in their eyes, their concentration. They listen to me attentively, even though I am speaking in Hindi language. Though they don’t understand the language, their attention is fully on how the vibrations are coming with it, how they are felt on the palms, and what is happening.. etc.. Now, they have dedicated their lives to Sahaj Yoga. They never think that they will do this as well as that. Only then you will go deep. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL ONLY GROW BY DEDICATING YOUR LIFE IN SAHAJ YOGA. YOU DON’T LOOSE ANYTHING BY DOING THAT, ON THE OTHER HAND, ALL WELL BEING COMES IN YOU.

YOU SHOULD DEVOTE WHOLE LIFE TO SAHAJ YOGA. YOU SHOULD GIVE EVERY MOMENT TO SAHAJ YOGA. THAT MEANS LIVING SPONTANEOUSLY. Where will the spontaneity come from? It comes from the living force. It comes from that living force which is ever present within you. You should not think of anything else.

Even otherwise you cannot enjoy. Only God is the enjoyer. YOU ARE UNDER WRONG IMPRESSION THAT YOU ARE ENJOYING. GOD IS THE ENJOYER AND HE ALONE IS THE CREATOR. YOU ARE JUST IN BETWEEN. YOU ARE JUST LIKE PIPES. If at all you enjoy something, it is god who has unending love for you. This is the truth, with which you can remain ever- blissful! You can never get joy from anything else. Whatever, may be the thing, He is the enjoyer.

So, the point is, today you get something you want, but you are not happy. Tomorrow, you would like something else and even though that is given to you still you will not be happy. Thus, you will never become happy with worldly things and material.

Paramatma (God) is the enjoyer! And therefore all should desire Him. We should enjoy the God, who is the enjoyer of everything. If we start enjoying Him, what else do we need to enjoy? We should enjoy His Bliss!!! What is God’s creation; what a beautiful world He has made; how many things He has given to us; now we have become sahaja yogis, God has given this Shakti in us; now we can know our Atma (Spirit), and can recognize the Spirit in others! How much unending ‘grace’ God is showering on us; with these thoughts you should grow in inner happiness. If you start enjoying the God and His love like this, then you will find that your heart is growing and still more growing and you feel as if it is encompassing entire creation!!!

TODAY, MY MESSAGE TO YOU IS; START ENJOYING THE PARAMATMA, LEAVING ASIDE ALL OTHER THINGS… ENJOY GOD, HAVE THAT JOY EVERYWHERE, OF WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO YOU, WHAT ARE THE THINGS HE HAS GIVEN TO YOU, BE JOYOUS ABOUT THEM. THEN YOU WILL FIND THAT YOUR ATTENTION HAS STABILIZED. IN THIS WAY YOU WILL PROGRESS IN SAHAJ YOGA.

Every minute you should appreciate, “ I have received this! I have received such and such blessings etc…” Otherwise your complaints will never end and your aggression will also not stop.
