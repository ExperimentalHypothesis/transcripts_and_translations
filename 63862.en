Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Delhi, India 25-02-1982

Our respected chief [UNCLEAR trustee] mr. Mahajan, respected [UNCLEAR], our [UNCLEAR] trustee [UNCLEAR], all the Sahaja Yogis who are blessed today specially by God's grace, I bow to you.

I am so filled with gratitude that I have no words to express the bounty and [UNCLEAR] of the divine. We have struggled so much to get a piece of land and so far we have not been successful. Though our president has [UNCLEAR]. Its such a sad thing that we could not manage to lay our hand on any piece of land [UNLEAR] belongs to God almighty. And our trustees have given up all hope of getting anywhere near and they started saying that Mother is a very impractical lady, she doesn't understand modern times how to behave. I wanted atleast one place to be [UNCLEAR obtained] keeping with the great principles of this great country. And this is really got [UNCLEAR blessings][UNCLEAR that has proved] that if you keep to your [UNCLEAR principles] [UNCLEAR it] will work out very easily.In the same way in England, they were coming to get a place and suddenly out of the blue they got a beautiful ashram. This really proves that if you keep to your principles and your love for God, He gives you your kshema. As Krishna has said, yoga kshema vahamyam. If you have taken Yoga, he'll look after your kshema. Poeple may argue but why is it taken so much time Mother when others are getting so easily when they get to crooked ways. My only explanation is that Sahaja Yoga based on a collective Sahaja Yoga development of [UNCLEAR you people]. Property and money is a big headache, not only that but it is one of the very big major [UNCLEAR sins] by which people [UNCLEAR fall]. You are going to form a society of spiritually enlightened people. Very pure and straightforward people, leading the path of enlightenment with the full faith that God is our savior. And that we depend on God and that we reside in the kingdom of God. At such a juncture, when we are facing the [UNCLEAR fear of the negative] thinking, we [UNCLEAR too] have to stick on to our ideas and to our faith in which we are walking. It is [UNCLEAR place] again and again, when you are capable handling any property that you get, any money you get, any position you get. Because human being are such that they can't even bear money, property, position, anything you give them, they make a mess [UNCLEAR of that]. So it is essential that sahaja yogis must come up to a point, of their understanding, of their character that they are Sahaja Yogis , that they are special, bearing the torch of truth and understanding because you are enlightened. God has given you the blessings, you have felt the vibrations, you have felt the divine power, you are realized people and we have to understand that unless and until we grow up to a point of understanding, of handling these material, perishable [UNCLEAR things], we should not also get it.

Delhi Sahaja Yogis are specially blessed because this is the first place which you have got now in the whole of this [UNCLEAR great country India]. All over we are trying, and I hope now the beginning has started, and Shri Ganesha is [UNCLEAR installed] here. With His grace I am sure more [UNCLEAR] will come up, we'll get [UNCLEAR] more people so generous and so great like the trustee who is sitting here, who you see is such a wonderful person, he is such a generous person and everytime [UNCLEAR you say anything to him it's] all done by God, I never had it, [UNCLEAR its given] by GOD, and is such a God fearing person that we should really [UNCLEAR thank] such a person is also a big blessing.

We are highly obliged to [UNCLEAR commisioner] saab for coming here. I have great respect for the whole family. Our [UNCLEAR] known for his honesty, [UNCLEAR] whole family is so renowned. And its such a family that they should now take to spirituality and spritual [UNCLEAR work] through Yogi Mahajan itself is suggesting that the progress of the family is going on the absolutely on the right direction. As I have told you why all the karma, why we [UNCLEAR upright], why we law abided, why? What is the need to be that? It is only to establish our balance but that also for what? Balance is there just to achieve the spirit. If you don't have the balance, you cannot achieve the spirit. And that is the reason this people are [UNCLEAR the] people who are very balanced, very dharmic in their life. I am sure one day they will be also very much in [UNCLEAR hands] with us and help us in spiritual enlightenment because as thinking people, everybody must know that todays crises is not crises of money, not crises of economic [UNCLEAR] or political [UNCLEAR], not at all. It is the crises of human being, its a crises of moral values. Crises of our security, human beings are not secured within and this security can be only established if you find your spirit which is the security, which is the embodiment of security, which is the embodiment of joy which is the truth, which is the complete activating divine love. And thats why I, I am sure one day all of you will take to Sahaja Yoga seriously and help us in another way that you all will be [UNCLEAR secured] interested members of Sahaja Yoga. We have no membership as you know, we have no listed society, we have nothing of the kind and we do not believe in the organized [UNCLEAR] because divine power is self organized, and that's how we have to prove now without all these formal [UNCLEAR] of life we have been able to get this place and now in this place also we have to lead a very Sahaja, loving, affectionate life. We have to treat people with great affection and understanding of the Sahaja Yoga. I am sure one day this place will be renowned as a center of love, affection of God. May God bless you. Thank you very much and thank you again and again [UNCLEAR].
