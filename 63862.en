Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Delhi, India 25-02-1982

Our respected chief justice Mr Mahajan, respected minister sahab, our beloved trustee Mr  [UNCLEAR],all the Sahaja Yogis who are blessed today specifically by God's grace,

i bow to you.

I am so filled with gratitude, that I have no words to express the bounties and the beauties of the divine, we have struggled so much to get a piece of land and so far we have not  been successful, though our president has granted that [UNCLEAR].

It's such a sad thing that we could not manage to lay our hands on any piece of land while the whole belongs to God Almighty and our trustees had given up all hope of getting anywhere near and they started saying that ‘Mother is a very impractical lady, she doesn't understand modern times how to behave’.

I wanted at least one place to be obtained keeping with the great principle for this great country and this is really God's blessing that has proved that if you keep to your principal, things work out very easily.

In the same way in England they were struggling to get a place and suddenly out of the blue they got  a beautiful ashram, this really proves that, if you keep to your principles and your love for God he  gives you your Kshema as Krishna has said " YogaKshemam vahamyaham"  if you have taken yoga he will look after your Kshema , people may argue that ‘why is it taken so much time Mother, when others are getting so easily when they take thru crooked ways’,  my only explanation is that Sahaja Yoga is based on a collective Sahaja Yoga development of you people.

Property and money is  a big head ache , not only that but it is one of the very big major sins by which people fall in it, you are going to form a society of spiritually enlightened people, very pure and straight forward people leading the path of the enlightenment with the full faith  that God is our savior and that we depend on God and that we reside in the  kingdom of God.

At such a juncture when we are facing chaos of the negative thinking, we few have to, stick on to our ideas and to our  faith in which we are walking, it is blessed again and again when you are capable of handling any property that you get, any money you get , any position  you get  because human being are such that they can’t even bear  money, property, position anything you give them  they make a mess out of it, so it is essential that Sahaja Yogis must  come up to a point of their understanding of their character  that they are Sahaja Yogis, they are special people  bearing the torch of truth and understanding, because you are enlightened, God has given you the blessings, you have felt the vibrations, you have felt the divine power ,you are realized  people and we have to understand that unless and until we grow up to a point of understanding of handing these material perishable thing we should not also get into it.

Delhi Sahaja Yogis are specially blessed because this is the first place which we have got now in the whole of  this great country , all over we are trying and i hope now the beginning has started  and Shri Ganesh is installed here, with his grace  i am sure more things will come up, we will meet more people so generous and so great like this trustee  who is sitting here who you see, he is  such a wonderful person he is such a generous person and every time you say that [UNCLEAR you say anything to him ] it’s all done by God. I never had it, it's your own given by God and he is such a God-fearing person that we should get it from such a person is also big blessing, we are highly obliged to minister saheb for coming here, I have great respect for the whole family, our chief justice he is known for his honesty, fair mindedness, the whole family is so renowned, and in such a family that they should now take to spirituality and spiritual work through ,Yogi Mahajan itself is suggesting that the progress of the family is going  absolutely on right direction.

As i have told you why you all need dharma, why the uprise, why we law abided why?, what is the need to be that?, it is only to establish our balance, but that also for what ?, the balance is there just to achieve the Spirit.

if you don't have the balance you cannot achieve the Spirit and that is the reason these  people are the people who are very balanced very dharmic in their life , i am sure one day they will be also very much in hands with us and help us in the spiritual enlightenment  because as saintly people everybody must realize  that today crises is not of money not crisis of economics as they say or political chaos not at all, it is the crisis of human beings, is the crisis of moral value, crisis of our security, human beings are not secured in general, and this security can be only established if you find your Spirit , which is the security , which is the embodiment of security, which is the embodiment of joy.

This is the truth which is the complete activating divine love and that’s why i am sure one day all of you will take to Sahaja Yoga seriously and help us in another way that you all will be secured  and interested members of Sahaja Yoga.

We have no membership as you know, we have no listed society , we have nothing of the kind and we do not believe in the organizing people because divine power itself organizes and that’s how we have to prove now without all these formal rigmarole of life we have been able to get this place and now in this place also we have to lead a very Sahaja , loving affection life , we have to treat people with great affection and  understanding of a Sahaja Yogi.

I am sure one day this place will be renouned as a center of love, affection of God. May God bless you all. Thank you very much and thank you again and again [UNCLEAR].
