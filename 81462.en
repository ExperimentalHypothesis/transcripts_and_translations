In Italy, when I used to cook for her, I would just wear a saree with a little border. She said to me, “When you're cooking, make sure you wear cotton sarees.” I said, “Okay,” but at that time, I had not brought many cotton sarees from India. She went to the cupboard and gave me a special saree—the one where she is standing by the sea, and it has kind of pink borders. That's the saree she gave me. You can see it; it’s a saree she wore a lot of the time for picnics. And she said, “This saree is really special for me.”

She also gave me a cardigan, some matching shorts, and lots of bangles she used to wear. I was just taking all the gifts. I was so happy looking at all the gifts that I completely forgot everything. I just completely forgot what I was doing.

The next day, that same morning, she gave me a new purse as a gift. Then in the evening, she said to me, “I got a purse for you.” I was just confused. I thought, “Is Mother testing me or not?” Because I got one purse in the morning, and now Mother was offering me another. I thought, “I'm being greedy,” and that maybe Mother was testing me. So I said, “Shri Mataji, I got this new purse this morning.” Mother said, “Okay, you got it. Very, very nice.”

Another thing, we used to live in Ealing. But hardly any Sahajis would come. Sometimes Mother would come, and I would just open the door for her. And when she went, I'd close the door. Now it's very different. One day, Shri Mataji was going somewhere south, probably. She was going with Mr. C.P. When she was leaving, I saw Shri Mataji had a little bit of powder from her makeup here on her face. I said, “Shri Mataji, please open the window.” And she rolled down the window. I said, “Shri Mataji, this makeup is here.” And she said, “Where?” I just showed her, but she still couldn't get it. In the end, I just took my hand and cleaned it for her.

All of a sudden, I thought, “What am I doing? Touching Mother's cheek!” I just felt that if Mother was going outside, someone might point to her face, and it was better for me to fix it when I saw it. At that time, I didn't know what to do, but I just did it. And then I felt really happy inside. I could see Mother's face. Another Sahaji said, “What are you doing, touching Mother's cheeks?” It was just done in an innocent way. It was very nice.

I have one story, which I just remembered. I can't remember how old I was—probably 12 or 13, in this house. It was either in a bedroom or a front room; again, I can't quite put my finger on it. But I just walked in, and there was a very ornate candelabra sitting on the side. I remember walking up to it, and without really thinking, I picked it up and started looking at it.

And Mother said, “Do you like that?” I said, “It's lovely.” And she said, “It's yours. Take it.”

Oh, yes. You have to be careful what you say around her. Because she just gives it to you.

What was your first puja like?

Well, the first puja I went to, I was told it was going to start at 10 o'clock in the morning at Chelsham Road. I arrived at the allotted time because I was quite punctual, but there was no sign of a puja going on. Apparently, it was happening on the other side of London at the Temple of All Faiths in Hampstead, and not until 6 o'clock that evening. So, I hung around Chelsham Road all day.

We had a full puja followed by a Havan. When we sat down for the Havan, Shri Mataji said, “Right, all the new people sit right at the front.” So we sat down right at the front. Half an hour in, I thought, “These people are stark raving mad. Let me out!” But I couldn't, because I was wedged in at the front. Luckily, by the end of it, I was cleared out enough to feel the benefits.

What benefits did you feel, if you could express them?

Well, I just felt clear, and very light and joyful.

The pujas were ironic because they were all held in this place, the Temple of All Faiths, and it was awful. The rain used to come in. It had one little toilet. And there would be six inches of water on the floor at times.

And all the international pujas were very long, weren't they?

Yes, very, very long. And there were all of us who didn't know anything about pujas. I mean, it was incredible. But they were wonderful.

How many people used to be there?

About a hundred. About 150, maybe. A little squashed in. They used to hire a professional pujari, and he'd sit there chanting for hours, wouldn't he?

Yeah. And then you'd get to the end of the 1,001 names, and then it was another puja! I remember that.

And you still stayed. That's the strange thing about it.

Yes, you stay. Even with children. It was a whole day and half the evening as well. I'd go out for a cigarette halfway through because I just didn't know what was going on. And no one objected. I came back and I thought, “My God, what are they doing in here?” But you just knew something was happening.

The pujari was covered in rice, wasn't he? He was like a pyramid of rice. A vast amount of rice. And none of us knew what was going on. Then they would wash Mother's feet, and it was awesome. It was so wonderful.

And Mother directed everything, all the time. But at the end of it all, when you came away, you just felt you'd gained something. You felt different. You can't really explain it. You just felt more...

Clearer?

Clearer. That's the word. Your head was clear. You felt much more supple.

She was so kind. We'd have a session at the end of it as well, and Mother would be under a blanket for the whole duration.

How long was it between getting your realization and going to this puja?

Four weeks. We asked if it was okay for us to go, since we were very new. And she said, “Oh, yes.” So she knew exactly who we were. There was no point in trying to pretend you knew what was going on, because you didn't.

No, but Mother knew.

And Mother knew. Things just dropped off, you know. So it was great, really, although you didn't know what was going on. It was fantastic. Even though you didn't understand what was going on, it felt miraculous. It was a very oiled, silky feeling. You almost floated out. I keep using this word, miraculous, but you can't explain it in words.

And she was so near. She was as near as you are to me now. That was the beauty of it.

I remember at one puja, they asked me to make the garland. They just had these huge chrysanthemums, these great big ones. So I threaded them up. I've always loved flowers, so it was such a wonderful thing to do. When they put it on Mother, I heard her saying, “Who made this? Whose idea was this?”

That year when she gave everybody the ties, she gave us all a present, didn't she?

Yes, she did. I remember I got some rose oil for the bath. I had this rather strange life where I spent a lot of my time, when I wasn't working, walking around the park looking at the flowers. So when I got this rose oil, I was absolutely thrilled. She said to me, “Oh, you look very happy. You look really happy.” And it was just this little rose oil. Everybody got the most amazing presents, just for them. What you needed at the time. So generous, so kind.

I have another story. In Ealing, one Sahaji was wearing a really nice, sparkly necklace. Her skin was very white, and I was just looking at it, thinking in my head how beautiful it was. About an hour later, Mother was going to the airport. And she gave me the exact same necklace! She gave me the exact same necklace and earrings. After just one hour, I got the same thing. That time she was going to India, and I went to the airport, and I was just so happy. Just one hour after my desire, I got it.

At Château de Candie, Mother gave me some seed pearl earrings, kind of like lots of them in big circles. She didn't give them directly to me; she gave them to Nita, who was looking after her, to give to me. They were on metal posts, but they weren't silver. Because my skin reacts to metal that isn't silver, I was looking at them thinking they were lovely, but what a shame, because I couldn't wear them.

At that moment, Nita walked in again with another pair of pearl earrings. She said, “Mother said to give these to Ruth, on gold this time. And tell her they're real.”

And then when Nita went back, Mother asked her, “What did Ruth say?” She wanted to know what I said when I got them.

This is a Mangalsutra. This is a Mangalsutra she held. And it has such tremendous vibrations. Yes, this is a gift from Shri Mataji. That's a present from Shri Mataji, this Mangalsutra.
