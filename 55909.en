Havan in Bordi (India), February 12th, 1984

Now I will explain to you what is the principle of Havanis. You see, the principle of havan comes from the basic quality of the fire. The fire is the one that consumes everything. So, for the consumption of everything that is bad in us, or defective in us, or cold within us or that is making us lethargic, making us anti-God or any such things which we do not want to have in Sahaja Yoga, is to be consumed by fire.

Now for that, we have to use something to extract. And to extract it, what we do is to take the name of the Goddess. So She, in thousand names, the thousand powers within us are awaken. And by every power, you try to cleanse one of the nadis that you have. Actually, we have sixteen thousand nadis within us, only on the Vishudhi chakra. But the main one thousand nadis which are of the Sahasrara, if they are cleared out, then all the nadis can be cleared out.

So, what we are doing, we are taking the names of the Goddess, by which we are expressing or we are trying to innovate or awaken a particular power of the Goddess, by which we try to use the – what you call- for the consummation power of the fire. So, the power, that is the Mother’s power, liberates and cleanses a one of the Sahasrara, one of the, you can say, the nadis of Sahasrara. And whatever is hanging onto it, is then thrown into the fire. "Swaha", means consuming.

"Swaha", now this is the power of the fire. Now the power of the fire, as you know, is that if you put gold, it doesn't burn gold. All the rest is burnt out and gold comes out as gold. So, whatever is gold in you, means whatever is genuine in you, remains. And whatever is artificial, whatever is wrong, whatever is anti-God, and whatever is depressant, everything is consumed by fire.

So, first because it is in my presence, in my name, the fire itself is an enlightened fire. It cannot be done with any other fire it has to be an enlightened fire. And it only gets enlightened if there are brahmins, means the ones who are Realized souls. Now there are so many Realized soul sitting, so the fire, poor thing, has to be enlightened.[Laughter]It has to do the job. At this time, the job is of a higher level, that it consumes all that is wrong in the eyes of God and brings out all that is good in the eyes of God; or say the gold, that is spiritual, shines out when all that is non-spiritual drops out or burns out. So, this is the thing is and this is one of the elements which we have to use, as we use now. Just now, we are using, as you know, there are three elements, obviously we are using. It’s the Mother Earth, the sky, I mean the Ether permanent, and the third is the fire, we are using.

Also, we are using water element in a way, because there is, if you see near you, is placed the Kundalini is this kalasha. If you see the Aquarius, it’s the symbol, Aquarius is the symbol of the Kundalini. It’s the fire, fire within- I mean the water element.So, this water element is placed next to the fire. And when the water element is heated up, with this enlightened fire, then it becomes a vapers and the attention becomes vapers and you reach the mountains of the Himalayas that is the Sahasrara.

All right, So, let us have now - this is all poetry of course.[Laughter]What we should do is to now, first of all, get some flowers and put them in the fire. Now this all you are doing to me: I am the fire, all right? So, now you are worshiping me as fire. Now sit closer to the thing. First of all, sit closer. Take.Gregoire: The mantra is-Shri Mataji: No, no, no. First, you say what I have said, in French.

Gavin: Take the roaming mike.[Gregoire translates in French]

Shri Mataji: Did you say about the Lalita sahasranama? Lalita is God. Lalitya, is the beautiful Mother. Lalita is the fine, fine, fine arts. If you call fine arts, you see, the fine art of pleasing the Mother. Lalita is the Mother who is the Goddess of fine art, divine art. Fine divine fine. Not sophisticated, fine. You see, you have one commercial, another is fine art. This is fine art.But the thing is all right, but my name is also Lalita. I'm born, I've been given that name according to my astrological sign.My name was is also Lalita apart from the other one.

Now at the first thing, what they are going to say to, perhaps Kunjika - that time, you have to put the flowers.Modi: First of all, we will say the three mantras. And after we say three mantras, then we will recite the prayer for Shri Mataji known as Shri Kunjika Stotram. When we say this mantra of Kunjika Stotram, that time, you can offer your flowers.[Hindi]

Modi: We will say three mantras of Shri Mataji and offer flowers to the fire.Sahaja Yogis: OM twameva sakshat Shri Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali, Trigunatmika, Kundalini sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namo namaha.OM twameva sakshat, Shri Kalki sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namo namaha.OM twameva sakshat, Shri Kalki sakshat, Shri Sahasrara Swamini, Moksha Pradayini Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namo namaha.

Shri Mataji: Come closer.

Gavin: Shri Mataji wants you to be much closer to the fire. You shouldn't have to lean.Michael be as close as you can to the fire. Close in, as much as you can.
