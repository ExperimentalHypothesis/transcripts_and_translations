My Dear Raol Bai

Lots of Blessings!

After coming back from Mumbai, I went to Geneva and after coming back, I started working in London. You took great care of us, looked after us like flowers, then who will fill that void when we come here? I often feel that it is not right to get used to such comforts.You welcomed us  so well at your home, you personally covered all the expenses. It comes to mind that you must have faced so much trouble, that you welcomed all the Sahaja Yogis at your home, perhaps I also couldnâ€™t have done it, there are many things worth thinking about. Anyway, all this is a play of Sahaja Yoga, it is right that we watch it! Shonu has been sent back to school. She will go on holidays after a month. After that she will study in Modern School, Delhi. Now her problem is solved. She misses you a lot. She was saying that I will send a saree for Raul Bai. She is very loving.

The work of Sahaja Yoga is going on in full swing. And it seems that something big will be achieved in a few days. Dhule's program was very good. The editor of Tarun Bharat also got  realization, if Sahaja Yoga gets established in Pune then the work will be done. Dhumal Sahab's letter had come and he has started a center in Shrirampur. Besides, Ahmednagar center has also started growing rapidly. Chavan Saheb has many acquaintances in Dhule. Familiarize yourself with all of them. By the way, Dhumal ji's son-in-law's father lives in Chalisgaon, take his advice also, and his son-in-law lives near your Dhule, so visit his village. Your son and daughter-in-law have progressed a lot, the brilliance of Sahaja Yoga shines in all the children. I was very happy to see this. My greetings to Raul ji, blessings to the young & elders.

Mother Nirmala who always remembers you.
