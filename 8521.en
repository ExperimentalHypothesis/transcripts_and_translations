Mahashivaratri Puja Date: 17th February 1985 Place Delhi Туре Puja Speech Language Hindi

On this auspicious occasion of Shivaratri, we have gathered, and it's significant that every time Shivaratri happens, I'm usually in Delhi. The most important thing in all our bodies, minds, intellects, egos, and everything else is the soul, and everything else depends on it externally. In the soul, we see the reflection of our Father, the Lord. Yesterday, I told you about the soul. That same soul is of the form of Shiva. Shiva signifies that which does not change, that which does not manifest that which remains fully integrated in its own place, which is described as immovable, unbroken, infinite. Today, we are worshiping that Shiva within ourselves. He is reflected within us. Through the awakening of Kundalini, we have come to know Him, and the more His light shines, the more illuminated our consciousness becomes. But it is very necessary to pay attention to this Shiva. To be completely open towards Shiva, to be fully taken in His direction. It is essential for us to understand what preparation is required for Him. Just like you put a flame in a lamp, but if the lamp is not capable of containing that flame within itself, then all is in vain, all the effort will be futile. If something comes within us that we cannot bear, then we will be the ones at fault. We are still very inexperienced about this that its brilliance, its beauty, affects the entire world and its glory spreads so strongly throughout the world that there is no need to explain it in any external way. Its light keeps increasing from within. The first thing to do to keep that flame alive is to not let our Kundalini fall down. Kundalini descends because there are many old thoughts, old conditionings within us, and it also descends because we are very futuristic. For example, if we think about Delhi, some people in Delhi continue to live according to very old thoughts, old traditions. They have such ingrained emotions that it's very difficult to remove them because they do all these things in the name of religion, saying that this is religion, this is how one should live. This is the truth; this is everything that will lead us to the Divine. Even those who walk with faith, their Kundalini cannot stay up for long; it gets pulled towards the left side. Therefore, the first thing to remember is that we will have to break many of our old beliefs. We should definitely embrace what is wrong, what is right, to move towards it completely, but what is wrong must be broken. If we don't break it, Kundalini cannot stay up, it will be pulled down. Another thing that is prevalent in Delhi is because there are government officials here, there are more industries, everything is very right-sided. Many things there are binding for us. Firstly, in everything, we operate as if in a military manner. For example, when it comes to time. Now, many people have told me that Mother Shivaratri cannot happen at five o'clock. Some said, "Just do it at four o'clock, that's all we need." Now, I said, "Brother, this is not right, how can this be done?" You cannot modernize Lord Shiva. Shiva don't stick the clock in His hands. So, everyone said to us, "Mother, somehow do it in a way that our problem is solved." So I asked, "What is the problem?" They started saying, "Our bus doesn't arrive on time." So, just make sure it arrives on time. Let it come at twelve o'clock at night! Many such questions arose in this manner. Your talks, they are very confused talks. What have you done so far for religion? How many years did Parvati Ji meditate to attain Shiva? Parvati Ji, who is the embodiment of Adi Shakti herself. What sacrifices have you made, what efforts have you made? Let there be a night-long vigil in the name of Shiva. What sacrifice have you made in the name of Shiva, or what specific system have you adopted that you want Shivaratri to change too? I couldn't understand how something unbroken could be celebrated during the day, so I thought if I somehow fall asleep, then no one will wake up Lord Shiva. But the point is that we try to understand the Supreme in such confused ways, it's a profound matter. You have made it seem so easy, as if you have made people reach great heights. When we met some prominent figures, they started asking, "Mother, why did you make them cross over?" It took us thousands of years of hard work, how many lifetimes we worked hard for it, and then suddenly we experienced vibrations, and you made them cross over so easily, why did you do that? We said, "Brother, the time has come, it's a time when many can cross over. This doesn't mean that you should look at it indifferently and adopt a practice that is completely superficial. And today, I want to tell you something special, that people are very lacking in sadhana. There are very few who know how to meditate, how to sit in meditation, and what meditation should entail; very few people know these things. Most often, they pray, "May my wife be alright, may my son be alright, may my daughter get married, may my son get married, and may my house be built. And if possible, let there be an ashram." If we want to keep Shiva awakened within us, then first we should become an ashram. It requires austerity, it requires hard work. Without hard work, tasks cannot be accomplished. Without hard work, I haven't awakened your Kundalini. This must be understood. It's okay to say that it's one's nature. Nature has been there for thousands of years, but awakening the Kundalini requires great effort. I have also made great efforts. It's because of that effort that thousands of you are crossing over today. And not only that, I am still working very hard. I work so hard that sometimes people get worried. But I see that when I come for just two or three days in a year, even on those days, you say, "Mother, please do Shivaratri at four o'clock." If there is no discipline within us, how will a temple be established within? Sahaja Yoga is not for careless people, it requires diligence, and this diligence should be such that you should meditate daily with seriousness. Every day. We don't have time; someone said, "Mother, don't do Shivaratri on Sundays because there's cinema, so very few people will come." I said, "And on this point, I want to tell you today, it's very good that those who won't come because of cinema, it's better for us, our strength will be reduced." Listening to all this, sometimes I feel whether people have paid any price for this Sahaja Yoga that is standing in front of everyone today or not. Until you value it, this work will remain fruitless, and this idea will not materialize. We often boast about having created a world religion and that the upliftment of the entire world is imminent. At least change your habits a little. For the past twelve years, I have been observing that very few of us have been able to change our habits. We went there (unclear)..... Someone told us about a virtuous person, saying that he is a Sahaja Yogi but troubles his mother a lot, doesn't care about her at all, doesn't respect her, and poor mother is a very straightforward and simple woman. Hearing this, I was stunned. How can this happen? It's such a disgraceful thing to say that the mother is simple and straightforward and is a boy's mother. So, if she is the mother of a boy, then it's a different matter, but if she is the mother of a girl, then it's another matter. But if she is the mother of a boy, it concerns you, yet if she is the mother of a boy, then I am sitting here to take care of her. Whatever the circumstances, you will be in trouble. Where will you throw him away? And now that he is simple and straightforward, then. When even Sahaja Yogis make the slightest mistake, the world sees it. If even a small mistake happens to Sahaja Yogis, the world sees it. There are many instances. And many times, I have lost interest in eating. You know, I feel like, "How about just having some chickpeas? That's enough." You know I don't have much interest in eating. And many times, I have seen people say, "Go to the ashram, it feels like sitting and having sweet conversations with oneself." Shouldn't you do Sahaja Yoga because the people here are very enthusiastic, they talk very rudely, and they gossip a lot. There are many arrogant people, very proud, and they treat us in such a way that we don't feel good. There is no love in them. Because it's about us, I'm telling you, now you should organize it. First, we need to control our senses. And therefore, we should understand that our tongue will need a lot of training. Initially, by consuming tobacco, I sometimes feel that listening to the things from all around, doing Sahaja Yoga, has spoiled our tongue. Another thing is that even if someone is standing in front of everyone today, whether they are angry or not, our tongue has been spoiled. People have valued this or not. As long as you have this desire and there is also a great craving for food in the tongue. If you don't value the tongue, then this task will not be completed. If it gets alright, then I think fifty percent and this matter will not materialize. We have done a lot of work. The meaning of the tongue is to always crave food, speak badly to others, scold others, speak dirty words, and talk too much. All these things do not suit Sahaja Yogis. And when it comes to food, there I see in people that there is so much interest. Thinking day and night about what to eat. It means you people feed me so much that you literally beat me. I have no interest in eating now, you know. I have no desire for anything else, just this thing; just getting one chickpea is enough for me. I don't understand why, even though I cook very well, I have no interest in eating. When speaking, always speak in a way that benefits others. But it doesn't happen. And in arrogance, first you should tie your tongue; your tongue, which should be tied in sweet tones, in sweet words, there is a way to talk sweetly to yourself in the mirror. Can you speak sweetly to me, or can you only use foul language? Learn to love yourself first. Then, this obsession with time, which is a big disease among you people, has now reached the point where even the world of Shivratri has to be seen through the lens of time! So, enough is enough, brother, your government won't rule over Lord Shiva. How far have we reached that we are even imposing restrictions on God! I don't understand what they achieve by saving all that time they've made. How long do you meditate? How long do you progress? This right-sided attitude is also very filthy. It makes a person so aggressive that they don't even realize that they are actually fighting with the divine. You should also reduce this. Slowly, discipline should be brought into this. This way, you can accomplish many tasks. Many tasks will be completed by your own hands. And if you go to your mother and say, "Look, Mom, how much respect I have for you, I will be responsible," and then your work will never be done, it can never happen, especially not in this country, and in the countries where so much time was allocated, it was only for war. That they are coming to war, if at ** o'clock, then at 10:30, we will go and kill them. There is no war in Sahajyoga; it's a matter of love. Who remembers time in love? You don't know, first the worship of Shivaratri used to be almost nothing, sometimes we used to sit in one place for nine hours. Even once not rising, that's also a record in your Delhi. Nine hours continuously. That's why I want to tell you that first, you become capable. Until you become capable, I'm afraid that any big ghost might come here, or any tantric might come, or any person might come who, if they feel even a little negative energy from you, will devour you all. I'll give you an example of this. Brighton is a place where, despite having the sea, people are very trendy, what they call, they are bohemian. And because of that, when we started the center in Brighton, many people became Sahaj Yogis. Some new things come, and they come into it, but they were bohemian. There was a gentleman who came to our program, his name was Michael Waikal, he was such a useless person, and he started talking a lot after coming. "Mother, you are this, and he is that," so we understood that he is a ghostly person, he has come for nothing. So we said, "Okay, okay, come to our house, meet us there, not here. Stay calm here." After that, he didn't come to the house. He went to everyone and said, "Look, Mother values ​​me so much, I am so powerful that Mother called me to her house. And especially, she has called me home." Everyone was impressed by him to such an extent that they were not ready to listen to anything else. There was a gentleman there who said, "No brother, this seems like a strange person, go and ask Mother." He said, "Mother is still in India, when Mother comes, we will ask her, anyway, this is very good." He said that everyone should love each other. They should be affectionate and talk to each other for hours, and friendships with women from here and there started, and people started calling him love. As we returned, suddenly I felt like knowing what was happening in Brighton. So I inquired and found that there were two people there, one said, "Mother, what is happening here, a man has come and everyone is stuck with him." So I immediately called the lady who was in charge there, and I told her to come here. I told her that this man is completely false, wrong, and not to get involved with him. No, no, Mother, that's just love, that's just being emotional. He said to us that there's not much time left in Mother's life, I am the one who has taken her place. When he said that, we believed it. I said, "Okay, if that's what he says." I said, "Absolutely, just let it go, there's no need for it, I'm alive in front of you now, you kindly let go of it completely so that you can understand how petty it is, and tell him to leave." But the situation went in such a way that they couldn't let go of it. Even when she went back, it was the same. The situation continued. In the end, you know, your mother is “Maha Maya”. When we started to investigate, he took another woman with him one night and ran away with everyone's belongings. That's when his head cleared. But even then, the woman who had organized everything was still important, she still couldn't get stuck in Sahajyoga, even now, she has come out of Sahajyoga. We said, "Now don't come back." So if you become weak, you'll fall into everyone's trap. And until your consciousness doesn't increase, how will it happen? And the consciousness of Delhiites is very weak. The weakest, among all Sahaja Yogis, the consciousness of Delhiites is only about money; they don't know who is good and who is bad; they don't even understand someone's vibrations, and if anyone like that comes, they get involved with him and believing in the wrong assumption, if someone comes here who is definitely a tantric, then you will be made a fool, so you have to establish your power, you have to create your own wealth, not only that, you have to create your own status, your own era, otherwise nothing will happen. On this matter, I'll only say this much to you that we have put in as much effort as we could, and now it's appropriate for you to put in the effort beyond this. If you don't work hard, then where will we find support for you? We can tolerate everything. Sometimes I am greatly afraid that an ordinary person, who is quite insignificant, whom you can easily understand how insignificant they are, you put them on a pedestal and then argue with me that no, this person is fine. It's so distressing. It surprises me and saddens me that when will these people enhance their consciousness. So, on this special day, let us pledge to our Shiva that we will nurture this power within us so well that we become powerful. We will meditate daily, work hard every day. If this vow is fulfilled, then I don't think anyone would dare to harm you or...do anything. The faults within us are not that significant, but the biggest fault we have is desire. Until the pure desire within us to attain the Divine becomes intense, no one can accomplish anything. Whatever we say will be in vain, and whatever we speak will be futile. Only intense desire is needed. And one should tell oneself in this way: "This is not my action, this is not my life, this is not my seed, but my only goal is this, and there is nothing for me. I am nothing but the sole soul." Such contemplation needs to be brought within you. As far as I can understand, I have explained it to you. I hope you all will make a complete effort to understand it. Now, first of all, we will worship Lord Ganesha; worshiping Lord Ganesha shouldn't take much time, then after the worship of the Goddess, then we will worship that which should be said to be the worship of Mahashivaratri because Shiva is our guru, Shiva is our soul. That's why you are worshiping him today, and that's why both worship become one in a way because Ganesha is the embodiment of Om, the goddess is the power of the soul, and the soul is Shiva. In this way, all three things are identical. Today is a very auspicious day, it has started on a very auspicious moment, and everything within you will also be auspicious. In the worship of Lord Shiva, most things are used hot, and after that, thandai is served. The reason behind this is that Shiva is even colder than ice. To keep them warm, all kinds of hot things are given to them. We are warm, so we have to take things to cool down, and yesterday many people felt very cool all of a sudden, but then they got warm again. Then, as soon as the coldness subsided, people went back to being warm. And when things cool down, one should think that the essence of Shiva has awakened within us. So, there is no need for you to get warm. Now, someone started saying that Lord Shiva used to drink bhang, so we should also drink bhang. You are not Lord Shiva. Then, you are you. Even if you consume dhatura, and if that doesn't work, then even poison, because Shiva used to do these things, so we will do it too. Those who say such things should see if they are like Lord Shiva. Can you drink poison? No, you can't. If you can't do it, then what's the point of competing with them? It is possible that we can take refuge at their feet, and this should happen. If you consume something cold and then afterwards you consume something warm, it can cause coldness on the body. That coldness, known as articaria, or any other kind of allergy, occurs due to Lord Shiva's faults, and the treatment for it is to apply Ocher on the body or rub a little Ocher. Those who have allergies should apply Ocher. Apply Ocher on the body or you can even consume it. Apply it seven times. If it is rubbed and consumed like sandalwood, then your allergies will be cured. Because then Ocher becomes warm, it contains calcium. This is also ash, if the ash is properly made in some havan, then if you use it too, your allergies will be cured. At this time, Ocher is also applied to the mother, to Lord Shiva, because they also have so much coldness inside them and it is possible that they may get allergies from the heat outside, and such things may not occur in their body, so they are kept warm. Allergy doesn't occur, but if Ocher and ash are not kept completely, we have seen that we get something like articaria suddenly in our feet, meaning that it is needed. At that time, the temperature suddenly drops, so there is a need for Ocher and ash. We will do it first. As it happens with new people, old people won't go; now everyone will come and jam, we all went inside, everyone stood in line. This thing happens only in Delhi, let me tell you, nowhere else, I mean nowhere else. Because whatever we say has a deep meaning, I don't want you to suffer the consequences.

Once we went to Ahmedabad and stayed at someone's house. We told them, "Look, we are going out, but don't let anyone sleep on our bed for three days." They thought, "Maybe his mother said something like this." So their daughter slept, and she said, "I shouldn't sleep all night. See how the people ahead are doing, how they are sitting, where they are." And then tell someone - Mr. Verma said someone was tickling me, like... The next day their maid slept. So the maid felt as if something was there, coming from above and falling on her. She got up to see, but there was nothing, so she also got up and ran away. On the third day, she apologized again, saying, "Mother, I made a mistake, I shouldn't have done it." The hands of the Ganas are very bad. They hit, they slap, and I keep paying attention all the time. They know all our protocols, where to go, where not to go. Suddenly they touch your feet in the middle, suddenly. Then they stood in the middle of the road, "Mother, this is not right." You have to walk in a disciplined manner. Look, now you are entering Virat's body. Now Virat is your host, he will give you everything. Don't cry over your own issues, "Mother, look what's happening to my father, what's happening to my mother, wherever it's happening, what's happening to my brother, what's happening to my home." Those who start such talks will only suffer. Now in peace, I've told Mother, "Sit down, you're here." If it's in your heart, it'll be okay. Such people are blessed, I'm telling you first. And those who sit directly in front, fidget, and rush forward, they're in for a tough time. I'm telling you first. Some people naturally emerge from cooperation, so when you come to the ocean, just keep swimming calmly. You've been taught how to swim. Now what's the hurry? I've seen a special thing about Delhi, it's still not getting better, I don't know why? And those who are from here, nobody even notices them, the Delhiites, but those who come new, they come riding on horses. This shouldn't be the case. Those who have arrived earlier, see how they're doing, how they're sitting, where they are. Look at that. And then tell someone - Mr. Verma says he doesn't want to say anything to anyone, people blame me. Oh brother, what fault do they have, I said it myself. It's a matter of understanding how much discipline there is in you. How much rule there is. There should be discipline, the rule of the Almighty. Now, up there, twenty-five men were standing. When they came out, there were ten. Those who are seated according to the rules, are seated there. In their place, in their place. You shouldn't leave your cushion. Where you are sitting, you are sitting with your mother comfortably. This should be understood. Sitting there, you are reaching your mother. It's all happening with the mother, there's such a conversation with the mother. Everything is there. If your relationship is complete, there is no need to run. Whoever doesn't have it, runs. This is the first recognition. What's the need to touch? There is no need. Where faith is fulfilled that yes, depth should come. It seems even more graceful. Now, when we go to the villages, is there any need for people to shake? Is there a need to come forward? Is there a need to sit there, on foot? Regarding religion, about deities, about the future, about Gandharvas, there should be some knowledge, some understanding of it. What is the protocol? Firstly, there is no need to look back at Northern Hindustan, when you are not there. If we are completely unaware of what's going on here, then we don't even know what's going on there. Muslims also have their own religion, all of these things are a night's conversation. Some things should be known, like what things are, who the deities are. Mother, give me a flower. Now, you have to put these flowers because it is the right of the deities. If you take any of these flowers, the deities will do something to you, then don't blame me. So, how will Shakti work? Straightforward calculation. Here, Mother, put a bindi on me. I'm not some priest, I'll put bindis on everyone. If someone gives orders from their own mind, then they should also stand in front with their own head held high. That's childishness. Wherever you sit, you should establish your own belief, your own strength, your own understanding, and wherever you live, our consciousness stays there. Wherever you live. But first, complete the connection with us. No one needs to tell us, we know everything about everyone. But if we don't have a connection with you, then it's useless. First, there will be someone of our own whom we can confront. Now, establish the connection... Therefore, troubling the same person every time they are new is not a coincidence.  Look at the elders, how they are seated firmly. They haven't gone up, they're sitting right where they are and meditating, aren't they? Now, from today onwards, we should understand that if Verma Sahab said something, you must not be offended. It's absolutely madness. I'm the one who says all that to him, what he says. They're not just saying things from their own mind. That doesn't mean they lack a brain. As soon as you arrive, everyone wants to be attended; it's not like there's going to be voting here for someone to flatter you. Please have a seat, sir, sit on the chair, we'll put a throne for you! It won't happen like that. Whatever anyone does, as if they have our hands, they're doing it like that, so no one will stay here without following the rules, it will be made clear. No one, big or small, should challenge them. They will do what they understand is right, what is appropriate. And so you must listen to him. Here, it is observed who is following the rules and who is not. This is very important. If you don't observe the rules, you will be pointed. Following the rules or not, this and that is told here. This is a rule. Because if one enters into the kingdom of the Supreme Being, then one should also understand the rules there. And the most help is provided in a place where people accept everything humbly. If you don't accept power, then how will power work? There are many people who are old and know what true Sahaja Yoga is. Understand it lovingly, it's a new experience, so if you want to move forward, move with that newness. Many people act according to their own minds. Some gentlemen start giving speeches according to their own minds, just like that. Don't do that. Then, understand that if Mr. Verma is considered the leader here, then we should understand that. So, we cannot have relations with everyone, we can only have them with Mr. Verma or perhaps one other person. Constantly bothering that person is not Sahaja Yoga at all. In Sahaja Yoga, the leader cannot be challenged at all. Those who do so fall. Because we know the leader in depth. We have a relationship with him, we should respect him. We know, and not every person here is going to be a leader. In Sahaja Yoga, being a leader doesn't mean they've become superior or anything like that. But they know, they are knowledgeable, they have a relationship with us, they directly tell us if there's anything, that's it. This doesn't mean someone will sit on your head, that's not the case. But if they make a mistake, I will catch them just like that. Whatever they do, as if they are our hands, they are acting accordingly, so no one is to challenge them. They will understand what's right, what's appropriate, and they will do it. And you listen to them, this is very important. Then there's also the fact that even young boys come to consider themselves geniuses. This is useless talk. Respecting elders is a hallmark of our country's culture. It's not like as soon as a young person stands up and starts babbling, everything falls apart. However, I believe I have worked harder there. It's possible that even the influential people there may lose their confidence. If you start laughing at your elders, if you start making fun of them, then they won't be able to do anything. Not understanding seniors anything and start doing things according to your own whims, is no good. And then there's the idea that the relationship of a collective individual is connected to a whole, such as the brain. Your relationship is with the brain itself; it's connected to everything in between. If your connection with the brain is broken, it can't happen. Or if your connection with the one who has a connection with the brain is broken, it can't happen either. This means you've become malignant, you've become cancerous. Everything is interwoven, like this. For this, you need a little humility. If someone plans to accomplish something big here, right now, it won't happen without Sahaja Yoga, I'm telling you. Like if a grand Guru Puja event is organized here, or Janmashtami; it can't happen. I know. Because only four people running around here alone.  This is not elsewhere. However, I believe I have worked harder there. If you also work hard, you can also move ahead of them. You should respect each other. You all saints and ascetics respect each other greatly. If one saint knows about coming of another saint, so you meet them with great respect. You truly are saints and ascetics, you are enlightened. You should stay the same way, with the same dignity as saints do. They don't speak much, they don't attack anyone. Where they sit, they sit comfortably. They don't leave even a pillow. If they are sitting somewhere in the jungle, they will continue to sit there, and be dedicated to serve.

May the Divine bless you
