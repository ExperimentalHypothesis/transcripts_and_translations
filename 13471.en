Talk the day before Shri Krishna Puja

[Shri Mataji speaks after the performance of three Indian musicians together, a lady playing violin, a gentleman playing flute and another gentleman playing tablas: “Together!”. The three musicians all go together to bow down to Shri Mataji’s Lotus Feet]

We have to be really very much grateful to these three great artists, you know them, all of them, you know Sangita (violin player - ed) whom I knew since she was a little girl, also Mr Ronu Mukherjee who has played before us. I asked Babamama what is his name, he said: “His name is Ronu”. 

I said: “How can that be, must be some other name also”. (She laughs) 
So it’s alright - he said: “No, because he never cried, that’s why he was called as Ronu”. (She laughs) Just like Babamama, you know. 
Now we have before us a very great genius, is this Sukhwinder Singh Namdhari (tabla player - ed). 
Somehow these Namdhari people have a great attraction for Sahaja Yoga. I went to Thailand, there were so many Namdharis, imagine. 
I mean, this is what we are doing, is Sikhism only. But it’s the Namdharis who can see that this is the same about what Guru Nanaka has talked about. 

They are the first people to enter into. Now of course we have many, and he, see, he belongs to the same very sensitive sect, I think they are very sensitive, this sect. 
I think he must have been a great musician in last life, also all of them.
Otherwise you cannot achieve at this young age this kind of mastery. 
And to do the accompaniment, the Sanghat, is a very difficult thing. I think is easy to play solo, but to go with the mood and everything of the musician, and to bring out the beauty without going into competition, but to slow down at a point, and heighten at a point, and all that little, little things, comes from a very large heart. And from a heart which is already a realized soul. 
Otherwise it cannot work out. I have seen people fighting on the stage also sometimes (laughter, She laughs). 
As you know, her mother is a great musician herself, right. 
And I hope I am going to meet her. I went to Benares because she asked Me to go there. 
And it’s as if through these musician also our family of Sahaja Yoga is expanding so much. And the way they are realizing the oneness of our lives and oneness of our value system. 
As if they are all getting absolutely lost into our own families of Sahaja yogis (She laughs). 

It’s - I don’t find any difference because they all have vibrations, they all play with vibrations, and nothing goes wrong. 
I have seen it’s just like as we say Sancharuna, I felt there was Sanchar in them the way they started playing, the whole Shakti started moving in them. 

And it was a remarkable thing I have seen, whether they are Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Sikhs or anything. It is this music transcends themselves. 
This Nusrat Ali Khan Sahib was sitting on the stage. And he just looked at Me, I don’t know what he knows about Me. And he said to Me (Shri Mataji folds Her hands): “Ma, come and sit next to Me here”. I was amazed how he recognized Me. I was like any other audience sitting there, so, like, I was sitting on the ground. He just called Me, I was so surprised at this gentleman Nusrat Ali Khan. 
So it transcends, you know. This music is Divine, it transcends all races, all religion, all nonsensical divisive ideas. No doubt about it. And that is what is Sahaja Yoga.

And so all these great talents are born today. There were two boys, little, sitting here, I must tell you, one of them plays very beautiful Murli (Hindi words), and another plays tabla. Both of them very good and very difficult song they played. I was surprised how they have picked up, and they are picking up so fast. 
So the talent among Sahaja yogis as I told you that this music of Saatajanam was, not only was written down by them in Hindi way, absolutely they didn’t know Hindi - in Hindi. Also it was composed, it was put to tune and also to the dam. By them only. 

Now so, how our music is spreading into their hearts! And this our music which is Indian music is really, is a Divine music. 
Also they have very beautiful, very beautiful classical music, no doubt about them, and I also enjoy that very much. 
But our music is a different type, because in this the rapport is established between the artist and the listeners. 
And every time they can start creating, they have freedom to create. 
And that's what I think the Sahaja yogis are just all the time like to hear only our Indian classical music, all the time. And they appreciate it very much. Whatever country they may come from, but you’ll be amazed how they enjoy this music. 
And this is to also say, one of the desires of My father that he said that our music is so Divine, it should reach the whole world. 

And now, for your information, we have already started a very beautiful music academy in Nagpur, and we bought a very beautiful land there, and I would like all of you to visit that place sometimes, and see these young people within three months’ time - they sing Malkauns just like any great musician, any raga.

I was surprised how these people - Rumania they sing Qawwalis so beautifully that everybody will be amazed, you know, there’s some sort of a spark in them. 
So not only it is spirituality, but the beauty of spirituality is expressed in so many ways. 

I don't know how to thank you here, My children, I don’t know how to thank you for giving this beautiful time to all of us, and we enjoyed ourselves very much. And I hope you’ll make it easy to come to India also, especially for My birthday we always try to invite many people (Hindi aside).
So I think already I am extending you invitations, and they’ll be all very happy to have you there, all music pagals. I tell you, all of them are (She laughs - Hindi). 
So, this little thing that we have for you... Sangita? As your name is, you are. Whatever small, they could give... eh? 
Sukhwinder! I don’t know what to say about you (Shri Mataji puts Her hand to Her heart). 
(To the flute player, Ronu): You are… Majumdar! Ah! What I was thinking? (Unclear).

Sangita (musician): His full name is Ranendranath, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Sangita: Ranendra… (Hindi).
Shri Mataji: Ranendra! 
Sangita: Ranendra.
Musician (Ronu Majumdar): Say my pet name, Ronu. 
Shri Mataji: Ah.
Ronu: Full name is Ranendranath. 
Shri Mataji: Baarpre baap. 

Ronu Majumdar: … so big…
Shri Mataji (laughing): Rana ke Indra ho! (Shri Mataji laughs) (Conversation continues in Hindi, Shri Mataji laughs) Accha.

[Some young boys and girls offer flowers to the musicians who have come to bow down to Shri Mataji’s Feet. Shri Mataji continues to talk off the microphone in Hindi to the musicians sitting at Her Feet for some minutes.]
