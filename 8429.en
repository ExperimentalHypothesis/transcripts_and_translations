Thankfulness, false gurus - India Tour, Feb. 9, 1979

The Deities that are in these centers, the Deities, this [ego and ?] the manifestation - cancer is caused. Cancer cannot be cured unless and until you get your Self Realization [if we ?], whether you are a doctor or anything I tell you this, [he goes to a doctor ?] from England, “we have cured a cancer recently”, I mean I can cure many cancer patients, [but ?] My interest is not. 

The only thing that will happen to all the Saints, if they go wrong anymore, will be cancer itself. Because ego, ego is too much, and ego comes from over activity here, it bloats out like that and from this another side where is the emotional side which is very simple, so you are clutched like that.

Now what has happened in the West you must understand. That you had too much of over-activity, your ego really bloated like a balloon and pressed this down. So you got fed up with it. They said, “To hell with all this materialistic development, now we are trying to develop material.” You see, Indians must open their eyes, they have too short-circuit, they want to go into the same circuit of getting into the affluence and then coming back to their own [knowledge / norm ?]. 

So they should feel their satisfaction within themselves and try not to overdo it. By overdoing it you just got time for it, so I said “Give up that.” That’s how you have given up like that, all right? But by that where did you go? From one end of the pendulum you go to the other side.  That’s why you have taken to the other side by which you take drugs and things, so you go away from yourself, it’s an escape. As this is an escape, this is also an escape, but face yourself in the center. So all of you are catching on the left for the same reason.  While Indians will be catching more on the right because they’re developing advancement. Advancement only should be of the Spirit. Once you get the advancement of the Spirit, Krishna has said, [“Yoga kshema mahamyam…” ?? ] That first you get your Yoga [and then shame to look at… ?]

But Indians, they may not accept these nonsensical ideas about sex.  But about material welfare they must get people from Russia, from Germany, from America and from England, “Teach us!”

Now, you have to tell these people that this material thing has led you to this kind of life, you are fed up of it, the complications of it. And that our people should not follow you going to the same ditch, and come back with the some grudge. Tomorrow Indian children are going to give up God the way you people are getting there, all the churches are telling, because in the temples you find all kind of nonsense going on. So we are on one extreme that once we give up, we become absolutely people who do not believe in God. So to avoid all this, you have to stand on your legs. By rising of the Kundalini the Spirit here is expressed through the Sadashiva, is the God Almighty there. When [this clutches passes ?] through this, it integrates you completely, it enlightens you, and there that principle of Sadashiva starts flowing through you through your hands as vibrations, cool vibrations coming. Then, as soon as this happens, the whole instrument starts flowing. That your fingers start telling you what’s wrong with the other person, you start feeling on your fingers what is the chakra for catch[ing ?]. Even a child can check it. This is what has to happen to you, then you get this state of Satchitanand. “Sat” is the knowledge; you get the knowledge about yourself and about others. “Chit” is your attention, becomes so powerful that you can pay attention to somebody and you can cure a person. You can find out what’s wrong with the person just paying attention to, just paying attention to person, it’s like a dynamic communication that is established in the collective consciousness. You become, you become, which is actualization, is not lecturing. You really become collectively conscious in the sense that you start feeling others. You attain a state of awareness in which you become aware of others, automatically spontaneous. Anybody, even a child can say, “Yes, this is wrong with this person, this is catching, that is catching.” You just become, which is not lecturing or brainwashing, it’s a happening, you should take it. This is what you should ask for. And not for some sort of a kick and a hallucination or some sort of a mesmerism that’s going on.

And you must know that a person who is a religious person, a person who talks of God, has to lead a very, very moral life, has to be an excellent person, has to be full of compassion and love and should be above all these worldly things, he should not take money from you. How can a parasite be a divine person? These are all parasites. For them, money is so important. They divert your attention to money, all the time they are diverting your attention to it. You cannot purchase such a person, such a person is a [king ?]. You cannot purchase such a person, you cannot capture such a person, you cannot handle such a person. Keep him beyond. But this is a big thing going on, people are creating a big, big [marol ?], and a big, you can say a very big enterprise, they sit down and find out how to propagate, how to have a big advertisement, how to do this, how to do that. And they work it out, they know, they are psychologists, they know how to handle your [sights ?]. Without doing anything for you, they have become multimillionaires.

People are disillusioned, no doubt, but say, about today there are 1.000 people with them. Out of them five, six, they are disillusioned first, so they get out. Then again five, six get disillusioned, they get out. Like [Penang ?], I would say, this [Raja yogi] started his working [in Penang?]. In [Penang now he cannot go there ?], because people will really kill him, because they are all like [a gemti car?]. He went there about fifteen years back. They are just like [gemti cars], [wrecking] the standard. They cannot take the name of God, one man told Me, he cannot go near a church even, he starts [chanting ?] - like a junkie. This is all known as [vashana…] country. You have no ideas to what you are facing with these people. You must only ask for this eternal of absolute height, but you ask for something cheap, [then why purchase it, there are markets for you.] People are doing guru-shopping, no good. That, if that satisfies their ego, go ahead, you will be born again and again doing the same work. What’s the use? If you are Saints, take to the right things. Only because I do not take money from you and I cannot pamper your ego, you should not give up what is reality. I will give you whatever is the reality for which you cannot pay, which you cannot maneuver, which you cannot get into your effort, but through your spontaneity you are going to get it – just ask for it.

I am your Mother, I’m going to tell you the truth. I am not going tell you, “Go and smoke and do whatever you like.” None of these gurus ever say that you don’t smoke. Nor do they ever say that you don't take drinks. At the most they’ll tell you that you become vegetarians. That’s the best way of making you people weak. This vegetarianism of this extreme type is also not necessary. All right, those who do not eat should not, but that does not mean a person cannot achieve spirituality if he eats other things, like Mohammed Sahib was a great person, Christ was a great person, even Rama was a [Kshatriya ?], Krishna was a [Kshatriya ?]. So only thing you can do is to control your food, by controlling food and all these things you cannot achieve God. You have to control your pure religion within yourself and that can come later on once you get Realization. So My style is first to give you Realization. How I tried to start your machinery, whether second hand, third hand [this – that ?]. Whatever kind of a car it is, let us start it off. Then it will work out by itself, you’ll correct it because you will know where [things are]. This is how My work is going to affect you and give you health. By this, your physical being is first corrected naturally. Because, if God has to enter into your being, it He has to be enlightened and enshrined, your temple has to be corrected. You must respect your body. You must respect your body! Then, your mental being is going to be corrected. If you have many mental problems, psychosomatic problems, they’ll be corrected naturally, because the mind that is going to achieve the knowledge of God has to be all right and you are going to be emotionally absolutely stabilized in love, in pure love. And not this lust love that every time you look at a woman you have the feeling of possessing her, every time you are looking at a man you have a feeling of possession. But flee from all this enslavement into a real dignified life of yours, that is what is Sahaja Yoga is. For which you have to understand that it’s not a cheat, it's a very subtle happening and if it happens to you, you have to maintain it and how to maintain it and all that, you have worked it out.

I have started My work with one person and now, as you know, in London, we have thousands. And that is 300 very good Sahaja Yogis who were just like you, who were taking drugs and everything, they have given up. I never told them, “Give up”, because you start enjoying yourself so much that you just give up. Because when the vibrations are flowing nicely, you feel better. And then you start doing with your hand all the miracles, the raising of the Kundalini, you yourself can do it. You can give them Realization, you can do it. Now you have that sensitivity, you have felt the vibrations of others. Did you feel it? You felt it what was burning, what was happening, isn’t it? All this sensitivity comes to you as soon as you start growing. Now, the only difference is you are the people who are really ardently seeking, you can pronounce it. But you have spoiled your Kundalinis by this kind of a plunging into all kind of nonsensical things. So I have to put them right. 

While Indians have got beautiful Kundalinis, they get it in no time, but they do not seek it. [who are they ?], there are [gojanna ?], and when there is [janna ?], [and so on. ??] Indians are only […] when I go to them there, they’ll say, “All right, we have had our [  … ??], now we are [GO??].” That’s all their interest in My [concept is ?]. All right, the most, somebody is sick, somebody is ill, just [??]. They are not interested in [ ? ] because now they want to  develop themselves, you see. You must frustrate yourself. Worldly developments have brought no peace to you, no happiness to you, that you know, but they do not believe. In this country, is so great, that you can live with little. In London, I’ve seen, that you cannot go out wearing a coat. You have to have central heated your house, otherwise you’ll die. You have to struggle all the time. That is the reason people have paid their attention outside to overcome the natural problems. While in this country, there is no need. That’s why in our country only these great people like Adi Shankaracharya, like Nanaka, like Kabira, like recently our Shirdi Sai Nath, and all these people were born because there you can live just in the jungle. You don’t have to pay much attention to your wellbeing, here you can get your living nicely.

This is the reason why Indians are so much religious, their attention is religious, their traditions are religious, we started [religion ?], but we have got such a big heritage, but where are we looking forward to? America and to Russia? Just go and see yourself how they are then you will never look forward to them. We have to look forward to Adi Shankaracharya, we have to look forward to our Nanak, and to our great Saints, those who lived in complete joy, peace and happiness. That is our heritage. We are not to play a role, these horrible things like [  ???] , that gives no joy, otherwise why are they here?

We have to manifest our goal, project our goal, our own image, which is actually based on the Self-realization only, nothing else. Let us be proud of it that we have got this heritage. And they are not going to respect you unless and until you are yourself. So, for Indians also, one has to learn a lot to be an Indian to understand what they have got already. These are all Saints, you see. Really they are Saints, believe Me, they are Saints, […born to seek ??...] but they are misled and with the [tons have gone ?] from your country only. So you are responsible to see that you give them love and to bring them back to normalcy. 

I would like you some time to come and visit the villages where I have done lot of work. I don’t work in the city that’s why I don’t have much publicity. City is useless for Me, where city is meant for people like Rajneesh and all these, you can go and put their bags filled up there with all the money that of city people. I go to the villages, and in the villages, you’ll be amazed, how they will assimilate, because you did all this to yourselves and themselves. You become just one with the artwork, I agree. How they were dancing and jumping with them and loving them and kissing them and these things.

All these false ideas, nonsensical ideas is Freud, who has separated man from man, woman from woman, woman from man, husband from wife, children from mother, all this nonsensical fellow, this Freud, was another attack on the innocence. And you accepted him so readily. That is the reason why such people, like horrible people like these sexologists are [xxx-ing at your cost ?]. Ask any Indian if they‘ve read anything of Kamasutra [??] or they want to? None of them. See the innocence here isn’t lost, they won’t even understand half of what I say, they are so simple. If you talk to them you’ll be amazed, they’ve completed [the for nothing at all, tantrism is the sewage] of this country. Don’t come to us through that [sewage??], come to us on the main door, then you will know what side of the sewage is. 

All right, thank you very much! May God bless you, let’s have it. Now, that you get your realization. [??] and settle down [??].

?? NEW SPEECH ??

Only thing to do is to come down as a human being, to live like a human being, and suffer like a human being. And He came down on this earth, to know now, to know the world that He has created, from inside out. That’s how He came just to save us. But I mean, he was talking and his Agnya was such a big catch that I was just paying […this / his ?] thing he is talking about itself is evident in him, that there is no sense of humility left in him, the way […] the sort of Ego he was using Christ for that, and a very horrible Agnya, and I cleared it out. The whole thing was later, I was thinking he was putting up an act. And then the most miserable part was later on when he said that, “What is your message for the people of other communities who are here and what do you say?” He said that we should love our neighbors and that’s how we must love you and it’s for the wellbeing, and that’s why we had started [a plane] by which we give  people jobs and look after them, and the thing was that philanthropic thing, and then it became a union, a labor union, and then he became a social worker, and ultimately he ended up with an employment exchange, you see, (Shri Mataji laughing) and I didn’t know what sort of a bishop is he? When is he going to talk about the emancipation of the Spirit within? When is he going to talk about the evolution, and when is he going to talk that we have to be aware of ourselves, and. Nothing, not a word, you see, what he spoke was this, and so disappointing [?]. I mean, all the way Christ came only just to give you jobs, or? And then they had a man put up there who talked about how they give jobs to people, who don’t have jobs, and how they create jobs. So the whole thing became an economic activity, you see? 

So understand God and His humility by saying that He should come all the way on this earth just to give us employment exchange, you see, I mean this is how if you are going to judge God’s incarnation. I don’t know what you are going to get out of them, because this is a wrong conception you have about God and His way, absolutely. And people listen to him, I mean without any questioning or anything because he was a bishop elected by all of you, and he was on and on and on. So this is one has to understand, why did Christ come on this earth? Why did He come all the way with all humility? Why did He come as a poor man on this earth? And why did He, at all, wanted to get crucified and to sacrifice His life for the people who were supposed to be sinners? This is what we should find out, you see, not for an employment of getting you a material gain because He Himself has said that a rich man can never enter into the Kingdom of God. So to get jobs for people or to get them some - there was a disabled person, and a disabled person should be helped, and that is the job of the church, and that’s what they were describing, that how they were helping the disabled people in this country. 

So because He cured certain people that doesn’t mean that He came to look after the disabled hospitals and things like that, I mean. But He came on this earth for a new awareness being shot into our being. He was born at a time where human beings had no idea as to what is the eternal life, what is the Spirit is, what we call the Atma is, that they never even thought that there is something like that. He was born in a place where they did not think on those lines. 

And though in India, say, we can say that people have been thinking about Atma and Paramatma since long, but they also achieved nothing because they were, I should say, all these so-called religious leaders of India were busy collecting money, then Christ came in, you see. And they were - I don’t know what sort of temples they had or what sort of pujas they used to have, or what ideas they had about God because He came out 2000 years. At that same time, Buddha, Buddhism also was spreading in India, and all these things of - if you see in the collectively, it is very disturbing to see people using Buddha in that fashion, you see. And it was necessary that Christ should come on this earth to tell them that it is the Spirit that you have to find out, you don’t have to worry about other things, but it is the Spirit which is to be reborn, you have to be reborn, you are to be [Christian ?], and that’s how we came on this earth. But He could not cross the limits of Bethlehem. I mean He was just, sort of, we can say of - absolutely gated into that place because of the ignorance of the people. His message never spread out where He lived. 

So His purpose was to come on this earth, on the Agnya chakra, as you know that, to open it, and to give a new dimension to our awareness by which we try to understand what Krishna had said that [SANSKRIT WORDS ??]. Krishna had said that, “The Spirit cannot be destroyed, it cannot be killed, it cannot be wiped out, it cannot be blown off.” [SANSKRIT WORDS] “It cannot be sucked in by any air.” And when Krishna said that people said, “What sort of a Spirit is that? Where is that Atma? What are you talking about? Which one is this?” So Christ came on this earth because He is the essence, and He showed by His resurrection that Spirit does not die. And He showed it very clearly what Krishna had said, because He was, you know, He was Krishna’s son, and that’s how He did it. But before He could deliver the complete thing to human beings they crucified Him, and that is the way they respected Him and that is the way they came to Him. 

Now in Sahaja Yoga also, we must know that if you go to Sahaja Yoga, it is not you are obliging Sahaja Yoga. You see, this is how a person talks today when Christ is no more. That Christ came on this earth, it was His humility because you understand how great He was. I mean, at least, you try to [quote that ??] you understand, then you say like that. But when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you think that Sahaja Yoga should oblige you and not you are being sort of under the obligation of Sahaja Yoga. 

----------------------------------
??? Christmas speech ???

Essence about your spirituality through completely humbling down yourself because it is the grace of God that must be sought for. And somebody’s grace you cannot force it down, you cannot demand it, you cannot ask for it. You cannot say that “I am such and such, such a big king”, and something like that, “so the grace should come to me.” No, it may not come to you at all, even you may be the highest priest of the Church of England, you may not get the grace of God. To get the grace of God you have to ask for it, you have to be humble. It is like we expect to go to the king [Salem ?], and then we want that the king should come forward, we should kneel down, and he should take you by hand and make you sit on the throne. I mean, this is something absurd, you can understand that. But even more than that is an incarnation. An incarnation comes down in complete humility, not to be humiliated, but to make you understand that an incarnation has come all the way for your emancipation and for your spiritual growth, then you should with great surrendering and great humility should accept it. But the general attitude, you have seen how Sahaja Yogis before coming and after coming, how they realized how others are behaving towards Sahaja Yoga. They have no humility about it, they’re thinking, “Oh, we’ll come and judge Mataji, we’ll see how She is, we’ll watch Her and we’ll do this, or we’ll come and see that Sahaja Yogis are like this.” They never come with the idea that they have to receive it out of their own humility because they have asked for it, that’s why they are going to have it. On the contrary, they behave so funnily. Despite that, they get it. Despite that, they get their Realization. Despite that, they get everything. But one should know that, somehow or other you should try to tell those who come, now you’ll be coming down here, see [Albena ?] is not here, and they’ll be coming to see you, many people know about [you ?]. Then you should tell that we have to realize, if we have to get something then there should be an area created within us through our humility. Like if you throw a stone into the Ganges you do not get any water out of it. But if you are a pitcher, if there is an area which can take that water in then only can you fill in the Ganges. Now, if you go to the Ganges and tell Her, abuse Her and say, “Oh, you Ganges, come along to my house.” Will She come to your house? 

In the same way one has to understand an incarnation, or a blessing of God, or grace of God, you have to ask for it, and humble down for it, they have all the rituals. For example - if you go to the church, [I/HE] said, “Kneel down”, even the priest would say, kneel down before him though he may not be a realized soul or anything, this bishop of Canterbury or somebody who spoke today, he is not a realized soul, his Kundalini is deaf frozen, but the way, see, everybody was sort of - very humbled down before him. He never deserved it, according to Me, he never deserved it, but we’ll do that. But to an incarnation not only that you are not humble to Him, but we are extremely insulting, humiliating and we crucified. We have to see that, human nature, it is such a terrible thing to do, and if this is done often then the wrath of God has to come, we cannot stop it because the way we are behaving, and the way we are looking at Him. 

Now, think of Christ, how He was created, as you have seen in the Devi Mahatmyam, the Mahavishnu stage, how He was created specially in the heaven, and then how He [was got it ??], you have read it in the Devi Mahatmyam, His creation. With all those things which are being done to Him, all the powers that were given to Him, and was specially asked to come on this earth, to live like a ordinary human being. Say, if you tell a king to go and live in a shack, or you can say in a place which is not meant for human - even human existence, in such places, if you ask a king to go and live, it will be very difficult. But they do it, they have done it. And when they come here, the attitude of the people, should be completely surrendering to thank God, that you have done this for us. Thankfulness, and the thankfulness is the way to joy, there is no other way. We get everything but we never thank, grudging type we are. Today is the day of thankfulness that He sent His only son, as we say, and He came Himself so many times on this earth, and how we have been helped by His coming here this aspect coming down on this earth. The thankfulness if we do not have, you’ll never enjoy what we have, whatever you have got, whatever God has given you out of His grace, out of His compassion, out of His love. There is not even a second, which you can spare, but thank Him all the time, only thankfulness, and when you thank Him, the waves of joy will rise within you. Because we do not know how to thank Him for what we have got it, you see, there is no joy within, and we are joyless people, we are very unhappy, whatever we have, we are not happy about it. So, this is the point is that, Have we thanked Him? Have we thanked Him every moment of our life, whatever He has given us? Is the great thing, the greatest thing is that He has given us Realization, and He has given us the way of Sahaja by which we can now find out ourselves fully. 

And the another thing is, unless and until that is done, we cannot perfect anything in this world, nothing can be perfected. All your institutions, all your endeavors are going to be imperfect, human being has to be perfected, and he has to get cured. And for that only simple thing is to humble down, humbling down is the only way you can get it. There is no way of arguing about it, there is no way of talking about it, or imposing or anyone, nothing of the kind. But how much you are humbling down within yourself is the point. Always look into your heart, humble down, humble down, and humble down, and thank every moment, every minute, and that is the key to spark the joy out of every moment. Every moment has an ocean of joy in it. But to spark it you must thank whatever you have got. But if you are a grudging type, all the time if you think that, “Oh, I haven’t got this, I haven’t got this, I haven’t got that“, then you can never enjoy whatever you have. And that is what is the message for Christians, for everyone, is that Christmas is a day of thankfulness because He gave His only son to you, and He came as an extremely humble person, in a very humble abode, in a very humble birth. And that is a thing one has to know, that we have to be thankful for what we have got, materially, physically, emotionally, and mentally also whatever we have learnt. While He lived in complete poverty, with complete thankfulness within it. 

So may God bless you!

I am very much thankful for this house, that My children have got it. I am very much thankful that My children are all here and they are enjoying. I am very much thankful that I am with them and that your problems are solved. I don’t know how to thank for all this, your love that you’ve shown, and all the beautiful things [here are ?], [in thinking ?] and singing, and how you have taken to Sahaja Yoga and working for, there is no end to it. But you also enjoy it by thanking all the time. 

May God bless you!
