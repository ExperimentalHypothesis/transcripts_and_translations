Interview, The Advent Inauguration, High Commission of India, London (England), March 17th, 1980

Doctor Singh, ladies and gentlemen, and Sahaja Yogis my children, it is so enamouring that I have no words to express anything anymore. I have been thinking what I am to say now? 
They say it is Kali Yuga these modern times and one of the signs of these modern times is that mothers won’t be respected and that mothers won’t be respectable. 
Who can believe that these are those horrible modern times which were described? 
I’m so enamoured with the way that all Sahaja Yogis have also done this exhibition. And I am thankful to all of them for organizing this program over here. But I am oi much blessed, I feel, today, to see a very dear friend of ours, doctor Singh, of this great calibre of learning. 

I met many bureaucrats I must say in my lifetime, because I am a wife of a bureaucrat. But I’ve not met such people among them who are that learned, who know so much about our Indian culture, who have gone into the depth of it to understand the beauty of that culture.

Actually, in the Indian bureaucracy, I always felt that they are more enamoured by the Britishers who left us there, without they tail coat, they still exist. I always had this terrible longing to see if some bureaucrats come out with this kind of learning, why we had Britishers in India who learned a lot about our country and who really contributed such a lot to our architecture, to the understanding of our old, ancient ideas that were very clearly given in Sanskrit language and translated by them in such beautiful box. [?] And that generation, I felt was over among bureaucrats who would go into the detail sand finding out about what lies in our country, the great beauty. 

Now, I don’t want to sound nationalist about it. One needs not feel that when I say that, India is a great country. It is! Because it is going to lead the whole world in spirituality. I have no doubts about it. It is the greatest country that God has created. I am not saying this because I am a nationalist, because I am an Indian. I could have been born in England as well, but because it was specially chosen by God. Now, it should not make people unhappy that: "Why Indi is the only place?" 
You see, it is something like supposing you know how to drive the car, all right, that’s a great thing. You know how to write a book, all right, that’s another great thing. And if you know how to administer, that’s another great thing. 

But if you know how to raise the Kundalini, that’s another different thing. So, what is higher and lower is not the point. But from a spiritual point of view, India is the country which is going to provide the needed leadership for all the people. This I am saying for one reason because yesterday, I has somebody from BBC. And he was saying that: "Why should you bring Eastern ideas to Western life?" I said: "This is not an Eastern that we are doing, it is absolutely fundamental within us." But in India, the fundamentals were discovered first while here you are going the other way round.

Because of the climate of that country which is so good, so kind that a man can live under a tree, he needs not worry as to when you are going out you have a cold, have this, that. It is such a nice climate that people needed not have to fight the nature. Here, the fight with the nature starts from the beginning, the competition starts and we’ll have a [?] very difficult. But where the country is so full of good atmosphere, the people thought: "What a blessing it is of God Almighty! How would these blessings have come to us? Who are we to feel that blessing?" That’s how they took to meditation long, long time back, thousands of years back. And this Kundalini yoga which I am telling you today, was discovered, I don’t know how many thousands of years back. The Sahaja Yoga that I am telling you has been discovered even at the time of Krishna, whatever he did was nothing but Sahaja Yoga. Whatever Rama did was nothing but Sahaja Yoga, which, if you ever come to my lectures, you can see. But this country was specially blessed where people just thought of God and nothing else.

Because our country is a yoga-oriented country, we have to say that it’s a great country. We are not ego-oriented, we are not competitive beings, we cannot be. People have tried to make us that, they have looked down upon us, saying that, "you are passive", whatever you may say, we are not going to fall a trap to that. Why, though our bureaucrats, as I have said to you, are more educated by you people, might think that way, but I would suggest that it is better to take to yoga now than to ego. Ego has paid its dividends already.

The problem of our seeking in the Western countries is really been misused by Indians for which one should really feel ashamed. And I take all the responsibility of that upon myself in a way. And we all Indians, feel extremely ashamed the way we have created such cheats and thugs who have really devoured all that was beautiful in the seekers. Seekers are genuine, no doubt. And maybe those seekers who are going today to India may have been the same saints born in India who were seeking too. How can you say that these saints are not genuine? I have seen them they are extremely genuine.

I’ve said many a times that England is the heart of the universe. If India has the Kundalini, heart lies in England. And I find that in England only, Sahaja Yoga was established so easily. Because when I went to America, I found the people were still very shifty. I don’t say that American people are not genuine seekers, but so many thugs invaded America that they got used to that kind of a selling business, the guru shopping as they call it.

But the people of England or the young people of England, I found them to be very scholarly. They are of course doubting, no doubt they should. All intelligent people should doubt they should not blindly follow anything like that. But they are not people who will not open their eyes to something. They are extremely balanced and they want to see what was there. It was difficult, I know, in the beginning to crack an egg in England, it’s very difficult I’ve had it. And I did not know how many people I’d be giving Realizations.

You’ll be amazed, for four years I was struggling with six hippies and two of these, husband and wife, are sitting here. But, to my amazement, when it started, when they sought it, it spread. And not only that but it precipitated into them. They have taken it upon themselves now that Sahaja Yoga is the answer to all the problems which are created by our extreme behaviour of ego or superego. This is something so remarkable. For that, one should not find faults with the country. I would not find faults with the country, after all, the country was created by God. It is His doing if He founds that India was the proper place where saints should be born. There were many saints here born, but as I say it today, there are more saints abroad than in India. Indians don’t have so much interest in God now. Only in the villages, that is why I go to the villages, I don’t go to the cities.

For example, in England, when I’ve come here, most of my disciples are, most of them are Britishers or people from Europe. There are very few Indians who are taking to Sahaja Yoga. It is most surprising though they come to Me for their treatment, for their illness, they do come, but taking to Sahaja Yoga that seriously as these people have done, they are not doing. So, the country may be anything, it makes no difference, it’s the people. Maybe tomorrow, England is the place where Sahaja Yoga may be established. And the whole when you [unsure] off the Sahaja Yoga which I say India, might be changed.

It is such a great, it is such a great experience to see that in this High Commission where I never expected that I’ll be able to speak on Sahaja Yoga. Because that Indians have value [unsure] in Sahaja Yoga, is the greatest surprise for Me. The thing is, we have become now still we are developing. When we’ll be developed like you, when we’ll be having the suicide as Gregoire has suggested, when there will be people running away from life, when they’ll be taking drugs, when they’ll be taking to alcoholism as their first life and last life, when we’ll be completely ruined, when our society will be completely finished, then it might be, we might awaken ourselves to the beauty of that we have got.

I’m not talking about something Indian; one should know it is not Indian. If you say Christ, Christ was from the East. We have to learn a lot from the West but Western people also have learnt something from the East which is spirituality. The I-ness [?] of spirituality of the Western seekers has led them into problems. The experience that they have to expect they do not know what to expect in an experience. They think they can purchase everything; this is ego-orientation. They think they can purchase a guru; they can retain a guru. They are very boastful of their guru, I’m surprised.
