Brithday Puja, New Delhi (India), 21 March 2004.

(Hindi)

I thank you all for giving Me this welcome…. with such great love and respect you all have given this programme, I don’t know how much I have to thank you all, I don’t understand.

(English)

I wanted to thank you all for giving Me such a hearty welcome to Me today. I don’t know what words to use to thank you.

(Hindi)

Today in every moment I am enjoying it. I am very happy, what can I say to you all, I don’t understand. Your love and respect is beyond my strength, beyond my expectation. I don’t understand why you are all embarrassing Me, I don’t know what I have done for you all, the thing which you all wanted to have, you have got it. I haven’t done anything for you all.

(English)

I was overjoyed to see the way you all welcomed and you are singing songs of happiness and joy. I don’t know how to express Myself because I’m Myself very happy and I don’t know what to say in your praise, where you have taken to Sahaja Yoga so easily and have assimilated it.
Whatever it is, it’s a very mutual admiration society, I should say, that we are enjoying each other.

May God bless you all with this happiness and joy and complete oneness with the Divine.
Thank you very much, thank you.

Now they have organised some music for your entertainment so I’ll ask them to take over…

Thank you
