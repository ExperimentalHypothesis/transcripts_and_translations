[Sahaja Yogi chants stotra (hymn of praise) of Shri Vishnu].
Om Shānt'ākāram Bhujaga-shayanam
(Om, You are forever peaceful, dwelling on the great serpent Shri Shesha).
Padma-nābham Suresham
(O greatest of gods, from Your Nabhi, arises the lotus of creation.)
Vishw'ādhāram Gagana-sadṛusham
(You are the support of the universe, magnificent like the sky).
Megha-varnam Shubh'āṅgam

Shri Mataji: See, add the "bhath" (cooked rice) on all four sides. Add it. On all four sides. Add it.
Sahaja Yogi (to all): Now, I will repeat one mantra. And you have to say "Namah" (Please accept my salutations) "Swaha" (Please receive this offering). 
Shri Mataji: Please wait. Before that, say one stotra of Shri Vishnu. The preparations are underway. 
You spread it (the rice) yourself, Maharaj. On all four sides. 
[Sahaja Yogi recites from Vishu Sukatam (Vedic hymn).]

[The following lines are chanted in conclusion. These were not found in any reference of Vishnu Stotra or Vishnu Suktam, transcribed below as faithfully as possible.]

Om devasya twam twa yashito presume shidorbahubyham pushno hastam dhyam 
Agneya tejasa suryasyate varchase indrina vishinchani bhalaya shriyeyase nadhyaya 
Om Bhurva Swaha, amrutabhisheko sum

[Shri Mataji explains the meaning of the recital when the chant is complete.]

Shri Mataji: Does this have the meaning (of the stotra)? Is the meaning there?
Sahaja Yogi: Not in this.
Shri Mataji: Is there an interpretation of this in any other (book)? 
Done? See here, now the logs have to be arranged in foursquare. Ladies should do this work. Kulkarni, you come here. Women should arrange the logs. Mind the logs. 
Sahaja Yogi: I found the meaning. I will explain.
Shri Mataji: You explain this in Hindi and I will do it in English.
Sahaja Yogi is explaining the stotra description line by line in Marathi and Shri Mataji is translating into English. 
Shri Mataji: Now, he is describing here, the Virata. The One, who is the Primordial Being. The Akbar. See, I have divided now, God's aspects in three forms, as you know. The first is the Void and the liver is Brahmadeva, where he creates. Shiva, where he resides as a desire. And the brain where he becomes the Virata. That is, Vishnu becomes the Virata in the brain. So the Virata is the brain. Now, he is describing the Virata. 
Shri Mataji to Sahaja Yogi: Tell it from the beginning.
Shri Mataji: From his arms. Who? 
Sahaja Yogi: Ashwini Dev (Gods).
Shri Mataji: Ashwinis are the ones who are doctors. Actually, the divine doctors are created through his hands. As you know, we have to treat patients, then we have to use our hands. You are the doctors created by Virata. And from the hand, the Surya, the sun. 
For he has got the brilliance of the fire, and the power of the sun and he has got all the organs, which are like Indra's very powerful organs. Has to be, otherwise, how can you bear the vibrations. 
By remembering Him at this time, you get the fruit of your worshipping and you get the "Shri". "Shri" is the beauty, the divine beauty, and also you get the success and you get the "Yagna", means that everything that is wrong in you, bad in you gets burnt up. 
These flowers we have put should be like ambrosia, and that the body should be peaceful, the mind should be peaceful, so the atmosphere is peaceful.
[Translation is complete. Shri Mataji expands further on the meaning of the stotra.]
Shri Mataji: This is the description of the Virata. So now we are doing this special Yagna today here because it relates to Shri Vishnu. Shri Vishnu is our evolutionary state. So that is why we have to pray to him that he should evolve us to be higher personalities. It is through him our brain evolves into the human level. And later on, through the Sushumna, when the Kundalini rises, then ultimately, that the Shiva Tattva shines in the brain and you become entitled to be, the Yogis. 
So that, the attention gets enlightened by the Shiva Tattva, your brain gets enlightened by the Shiva Tattva and that is how the Shiva Tattva starts flowing through your awareness. 
Sahaja Yogi: Now I will repeat the name and you have to say "Namah Swaha" by taking your hand like this and throwing it (the offering into the Havan). 
[The offering has to be held over the Sahasrara and moved in a circular motion one or more times and then put into the Havan. Some Sahaja Yogis are moving the offering clockwise over the Sahasrara and some others do it anti-clockwise. ]
Shri Mataji: Om Twameva Sakshat has to be said.
Sahaja Yogi: Om Twameva Sakshat.
Shri Mataji: Yes. And keep your right hand down. Then it will come all right. Now, it is a lot better.
Sahaja Yogi: [INAUDIBLE, probably asking Mother to accept the offering.]
Shri Mataji: Why me? You are offering to me. I do not want it. Put in the middle. Not to me. 
Sahaja Yogi: Camphor?
Shri Mataji: So much camphor all at once?
Sahaja Yogi: Just put two to three pieces. 
Shri Mataji: You do not pay attention there, Mister. Whatever is there, is enough. You need not to pay attention there.
[Sahaja Yogis recite 108 names of Shri Krishna from Shri Krishna Stotra].
[Shri Mataji is guiding Sahaja Yogis on Havan offerings as chants fill the air.]
Shri Mataji: Keep adding the logs on it or it will simply get wasted. Put it on top. 
You keep chanting.
Hold the logs over it. The ladies also have to see it to it. Come on.
Add some ghee over it. Add it from both sides. Keep some ghee here.
Enough. Now do not add more wood to the fire. Add ghee.
Now add some logs to the side. On all four sides. On the sides. Do not add in the middle. 
Give it to him.
Chavan, you sit. 
Chavan? Where is he? Is he not here? 
Now add the rice grains from the side. With a spoon.
(To Chavan?) Sit.
Come forward.
Shift a bit here.
[The Havan fire starts crackling nicely, halfway through the 108 names].
Keep adding the rice.
That is it, enough. 
Actually, these are names of Shri Krishna.
Keep adding ghee. 
Keep adding the rice. The one from the side. Keep adding the rice from the side.
With a spoon. 
No, only a little is left.

Shri Mataji: What has happened is, these are all Shri Krishna's names. Shri Krishna. Are there different ones for Shri Vishnu? 
Sahaja Yogi: "Sahasrara Namavali" (1,000 names).

[A Sahaja Yogi leads the description of the badha, and everyone repeats Swaha in chorus.]

After coming to Sahaja Yoga and indulging in such nonsensical addictions, bringing sternness in their talk, obstructing the work of Sahaja Yoga, all such badhas of Sahaja Yogis, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Then, the leaders in Sahaja Yoga, the sternness in their talk, the badhas of that, Swaha. All the leaders who are there. 
Sahaja Yogi: Those who consider themselves leaders in Sahaja Yoga, all over the world, in reality, they are not, but those who think no end of themselves, their badhas of harsh talk, rigidity and ego, Swaha!

Sahaja Yogi: The badhas of considering themselves all-knowing.

Sahaja Yogi: One thing is left.

Shri Mataji: Next, of "bhaubandhki" (brotherhood).
Sahaja Yogi: The badhas of brotherhood and politics in Sahaja Yoga, Swaha!

The badhas of "gruhinis" (housewives) of Sahaja Yogis, Swaha!

Shri Mataji: The attention of Sahaja Yogis into useless things. Meaning, paying too much attention to (their) wives, paying too much attention to men, Swaha!
Sahaja Yogi: Paying attention to irrelevant things, forgetting and taking attention away from the path of Parameshwara, whatever badhas still have a hold over Sahaja Yogis despite being in Sahaja Yoga for so many years, all these badhas of Sahaja Yogis, Swaha.
Shri Mataji: Then, the caste system.
Sahaja Yogi: Whatever ideas of caste are still entrenched more than required, within Sahaja Yogis, all those badhas, Swaha! 
Shri Mataji: In (their) heads.
Shri Mataji: Then, those who look at Sahaja Yoga with "khulepana" (simple, or in this context superficial). Meaning, "(Shri Mataji) has to come to my house", "has to eat at my house", "has to have a cup of tea at my house", these types of "khule" feelings.
Sahaja Yogi: Despite coming to Sahaja Yoga, looking at Shri Mataji, in Her human form, and not recognising Her true form with inner attention, all those badhas, Swaha!
Shri Mataji (correcting): The "khulepana", the feeling (revering Mother in her human form only), "thillarpana karne" (behaving frivolously).
Sahaja Yogi: Despite coming to Sahaja Yogi, the feeling of "khulepana", being possessive or trying to establish familial proximity to Mother, feelings of these kinds, even the badhas of such (narrow-minded) feelings, Swaha! 
Shri Mataji: Similarly, asking for material or transactional welfare and not asking for the Spirit, the badhas arising from that, Swaha!
Sahaja Yogi: Despite coming to Sahaja Yoga, in spite of coming into the Kingdom of God, expecting that "my material wealth will improve with Sahaja Yoga", "my family will be helped", "everything else can stay aside", tendencies of these kinds, the badhas of these tendencies, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: My son, my daughter, my wife. This "Me"ness, this should also go.
Sahaja Yogi: One's own daughter, own son, own wife, focusing only on one's family, ignoring our foreign brothers and sisters who have travelled here, forgetting or failing to recognise that they are our brothers and sisters, not attaining the feeling that these are our real brothers and sisters, this is our Sahaja Yoga community, all those badhas, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: In the whole world, all our brothers and sisters are our flesh and blood, they have taken birth from the womb of the same Mother. The behaviour that goes against that (reality), the "nishtha" (loyalty) that does not develop, the feelings that do not develop within us, that badhas that obstruct these feelings, Swaha!
All Sahaja Yogis: Swaha!
Sahaja Yogi: After coming to Sahaja Yoga and despite developing these global relationships, having foolish [INAUDIBLE] notions, with respect to the work, and the divisions which are being created knowingly or unknowingly, in people's thoughts and speech; in spite of being in Sahaja Yoga, they do not forget people's nationality, also about ashrams and centres. This centre, that centre. This has to happen with this centre only.
Shri Mataji: Means "khoti buddhi" (narrow/divisive).
Sahaja Yogi: "Kothepana". They are English. They are American. They are Indian. This attitude, this mentality is a kind of stupidity. That this is only one world for Sahaja Yoga, the badhas that obstruct this feeling taking root in the mind, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Now, let the foreigners say what they want to say. They (the Indian Sahaja Yogis) have said all the badhas that come in the establishment of one Universal Kingdom of God. All the badhas. See, one should not think you are an Englishman or Australian. You are all one in the Kingdom of God. So this what they have said it. Now you have to say something about it. 
All the conditionings of the Western minds. 
Sahaja Yogi: First of all, all the ego of the Western mind, Swaha!
Shri Mataji (in Marathi, to Indian Sahaja Yogis): You did not say what ego we have over here. They (foreign Sahaja Yogis) are saying they have it. We are very egoistical people.
Sahaja Yogi (in Marathi): We have ego here, as well.
Sahaja Yogi: All the arrogance of the Western mentality that thinks it is better than anybody else, Om Swaha!
Shri Mataji (in Marathi, to Indian Sahaja Yogis): They blame themselves.
Sahaja Yogi: All the conditionings which make us slaves to our superego, Om Swaha!
All the badhas in the West that make us divided from people who have to give us something in the East, Om Swaha!
All the badhas which stop us from becoming one complete Universal Being in our Mother, Om Swaha!
All the badhas which make us separate in any way, as brothers and sisters, as relations as spiritual beings together, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: The planning temperament. See, still, there is planning, thinking, analysing, criticising.
Sahaja Yogi: All the badhas against spontaneity, all the badhas of planning too much, thinking too much, the badhas of analysing too much, projecting too much, Om Swaha! 
Shri Mataji: No, against surrendering.
Sahaja Yogi: All the badhas against surrender to our Mother, Om Swaha! 
All the badhas which think that we are doing the job, when in fact, we leave it at the holy feet of our Mother, Om Swaha!
Shri Mataji: And all the badhas in the ascent. 
Sahaja Yogi: All the badhas which prevent.
Shri Mataji: In the fast ascent.
Sahaja Yogi: All the badhas which prevent our rapid and fast ascent into the Kingdom of God, Om Swaha!
All the badhas which hold us back and try to interrupt our progress by dividing us and by torturing us from time to time, Om Swaha!
Shri Mataji: And wrong attention on negative people.
Sahaja Yogis: All the badhas within us which put our attention to the negativity in others and the negative people who receive our attention, Om Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Now the centres, you can say. All the centres. All the centres of the world.
Sahaja Yogi: Just as one, Mother? Or through the lot.
Shri Mataji: You say all of them. It will be better.
Sahaja Yogi: [INAUDIBLE].
Shri Mataji: No, you say yours and he will say [INDAUDIBLE].
In Marathi: Put it now. Touch it and see, the vibrations will start now. The smoke will go.
Sahaja Yogi: All the Australian centres, Om Swaha! 
All Austrian centres, Om Swaha!

All the badhas of the Canadian centres, Om Swaha!

All the badhas of West African countries, Om Swaha!

All the badhas of Latin American centres, Om Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Malaysia.
Sahaja Yogi: All the badhas of Malaysia, Om Swaha!
All the badhas of United Kingdom centres, Om Swaha!
Shri Mataji: What about Spain?
Sahaja Yogi: I have already said that. Let us say it again.
All the badhas of the Spanish centres, Om Swaha!
All the badhas of Iranian centre, Om Swaha!
Shri Mataji: All the badhas of "United Bhoots (ghosts) Centres" (laughs).
Sahaja Yogis: International.
Sahaja Yogi: To the badhas which are the unity of bhoots, Om Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Fraternity (laughing).
Now done? Now we will do.
Sahaja Yogi: All the badhas which prevent us from being absolutely loving to our brothers and sisters, Om Swaha!
All the badhas which prevent us from being totally devoted to our Divine Mother, Om Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Now take the ones here in India.
Sahaja Yogi: After coming to Sahaja Yoga, doing sadhana for more than ten years, Mataji who is Sakshat Parabrahma, knowingly or unknowingly, that recognition still does not come. And even after having the recognition, knowingly or unknowingly, we keep doing human planning, ignoring Mother's planning. That Mother is an Avatar, we forget this truth easily, we keep seeing the human form only. Even in speaking with Mother, knowingly or unknowingly, we assume we are the ones responsible for doing the work. This type of ego, ignorance and knowingly or unknowingly, the stupidity (underlying it), all those badhas, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: These are of "Andhalepan" (blindness). Andhalepan. Your brains recognise but not the heart. The heart should recognise. Of the heart. The heart should get the eyes (to see). Next.
Now, say the badhas of all the Sahaja Yoga centres in India. Say it as one country.
Sahaja Yogi: Sahaja Yoga is functioning by the "Sankalp" (intention) of Shri Mataji, and by Shri Mataji's "sanket" (guidance), each and every minute is pre-determined. Regarding Sahaja Yogis. Where Sahaja Yogis should live, what they should eat and drink, where they should go, Shri Mataji decides that. What has to be done today, what program has to be conducted today, Parameshwar has decided this. Not recognising this truth is a type of ignorance. This is a major badha of ignorance which has come and is residing in Sahaja Yoga, the badhas of this type of blindness, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Second thing, someone going and telling Mataji something, saying this person said this of Mataji, he said this against you, or someone else said, so you need to go and tell Mataji, this illusionary idea that you have, it is a very big badha. I know everything, I know everything about everyone, no need to tell Me and no one can tell Me. So it must be understood that your Mother, within Her, in Her head, Sakshat Virata is there. So you need not tell me anything. So whatever badhas you have of such illusionary ideas, say Swaha to all of them.
Sahaja Yogis: Swaha!
Sahaja Yogis: Illusionary concepts.
Sahaja Yogi: In this Universe and in every atom, Shri Mataji has her existence. Shri Mataji is Sakshat Parameshwar (Verily, God Almighty), not accepting this truth in our innermost Self, it is assumed that Shri Mataji does not come to know of anything. Shri Mataji sees with infinite eyes.
Shri Mataji: She is simple, she does not understand anything.
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji sees with infinite eyes and through time immemorial, she hears everything, sees everything and is established in every photo. Not only that, we cannot hide our innermost thoughts, good or evil from Shri Mataji. Being ignorant of this also means completely falling behind in the Kingdom of God. This ignorance, these illusionary ideas, thinking oneself to be too clever, all these types of badhas, which will damage (progress) to God Almighty, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Now, all the badhas of all centres of Hindustan (India).
Sahaja Yogi: Every person coming to Sahaja Yoga, every person that Shri Mataji has accepted unto Her feet, is special to the work of Sahaja Yoga in some way or other. Instead of accepting this feeling, Shri Mataji (he) did this or that, - every person coming to Shri Mataji is "punyavaan" (meritorious with good deeds). No one can be higher or lower than the other. That person is superior, punyavaan has come to the feet of Shri Adi Shakti due to their "sanchit" (accumulated good karma). Forgetting this feeling, easily forgetting this feeling, considering oneself to be great, this egoistic feeling, the badhas created by the ego, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Now badhas of all centres Swaha. Badhas of all centres in India, Swaha!
Sahaja Yogis: All kinds of badhas of all centres in India, Swaha! 
The badhas created knowingly or unknowingly, any badhas of all centres overlooked in our mention by mistake, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Of the politics in India.
Sahaja Yogi: The badhas of the political class in India, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Now, badhas the scientists.
Sahaja Yogi: All types of badhas of the scientific class in India, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: And the intellectual fools (or pseudo-intellectuals).
Sahaja Yogi: All types of badhas of the education sector and pseudo-intellectuals, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: And social.
Sahaja Yogi: All types of badhas of leaders of society, politicians in India indulging in anti-social activities, Swaha.
Shri Mataji: And those lowering the moral level.
Sahaja Yogi: The badhas of those lowering morality in India to the depths, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: The badhas of not being straight-forward, playing games of cunning, Swaha!
Sahaja Yogi: During (Sahaja Yoga) work, despite coming face to face with the Truth, attaining prosperity and self-realization, we make an about-turn, when it is time to face the Truth. The badhas of such "running away", Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Now, all badhas coming into the collectivity, Swaha!
Sahaja Yogi: The "sangha" of collectivity, forming a global relationship, the badhas which obstruct the collectivity, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Now, the badhas of people not coming to the centre, Swaha! Regularly.
Sahaja Yogi: Considering one's own house to be their "castle" and making innumerable excuses for not coming to the centre, all these types of badhas, Swaha! 
Sahaja Yogi: Remaining, for the projects.
Shri Mataji: The projects that we are going to initiate, the badhas coming in the way, Swaha!
Sahaja Yogi: Jaganmata Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi has initiated many projects for the progress of Sahaja Yoga. The badhas that come in the way of these projects, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Financial and legal.
Sahaja Yogi: The political, financial and bureaucracy badhas of all types, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: So is everyone done? Against collectivity. Sitting at home, one who thinks, we have done it. No, you have to go to the centre of religiously. Take responsibility. The badhas of irresponsible behaviour, all Swaha!
Sahaja Yogis: Swaha!
Sahaja Yogi: After coming to Sahaja Yoga, behaving irresponsibility and undermining the progress of Sahaja Yoga, the badhas of such tendencies, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: All the badhas of not understanding that one is a very great yogi.
Sahaja Yogis: Swaha!
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, even at this age of 61, is striving for us day and night. She barely gets four hours of rest in a day. Despite understanding this, interrupting into her rest period with some family issues, the badhas of these tendencies, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: (Laughs) Mother has to be troubled, otherwise how is one to manage? Done? Now, do the "purnavati" (the final offering to complete the Havan).
Sahaja Yogi: The badhas created by the ignorance Sahaja Yogis, knowingly or unknowingly, Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Everyone is forgiven. Forget what has happened. But correct the path ahead. Going forward, we will dedicate ourselves to the work of Sahaja Yoga. There is nothing more important than that. The first priority is Sahaja Yoga, everything else is secondary. In that, we will bind our minds completely and get fully involved in the work of Sahaja Yoga. We will help in every way. Make this firm resolve in your minds and with this, you must complete this yagna. 
Now come, take it in your hand. Is it there, the "bael" fruit?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, the bael fruit is here.
Shri Mataji: Take it. Give it in their hands. Are is there some ghee? Put it in the container of ghee. And anything else that is still remaining, take it in the hand as well. Now, what is remaining? Whatever is remaining, place it right in the middle. Come. He will say it. "Purnavidhan" (the first verse in a purnavati).
Sahaja Yogi: We have to stand up, is it not?
Shri Mataji: What?
Sahaja Yogi: Stand up for the purnavati.
Shri Mataji: Stand up. See, it is found.
[Sahaja Yogis are looking for the purnavati text to recite. Someone finds an "aarti" text].
Shri Mataji: "Purnavidham, purnavidya..", that is how it is. 
Sahaja Yogi: This is for "aarti".
Shri Mataji: Aarti after that. It (the text) must be in the "vidhi" (ritual book). It may be at the end of the Vishnu Sahasranaam. Look at the end of the Vishnu Sahasranama.
[Sahaja Yogis are looking for the text].
Shri Mataji: It is from last time. It should be memorised. It is quite short.
Sahaja Yogis (to each other): Is it not in the index?
[Still no luck].
Shri Mataji: Let it be. I will say it. Say after me..add it.. is it there? Say it. Add it. Come On. 
Sahaja Yogi: It could not be found, please You say.
Shri Mataji: Purnavidham, purnavidhyat..I have also forgotten. Just add whatever is there.
Sahaja Yogis: Om Swaha!
Shri Mataji: Now you all recite everything, so I do not have it (memorised) by heart. Next time, I will memorise it. 
Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai! 
Adishakti Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!
Mahamaya Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!
Shri Mataji: Now you say the aarti. Now we will all complete the aarti. Add everything in it. Fruits and everything. The fruits at the side, everything, the ghee and anything else. 
Sahaja Yoginis: Who will hold the aarti? 
Shri Mataji: Give it to the women. Call Chavan. Please come. Warren, come along.
Warren: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Come forward. 
Shri Mataji: Sab Ko Dua Dena.
[Sahaja Yogis are standing in front of Shri Mataji, holding the aarti to offer to Mother. 
Sahaja Yogis recite Mahamantras.]
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahalaxmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali, Trigunatmika, Sakshat Shri Adishakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

[Mother is asking everyone to prostrate down and come forward].
Come forward on your knees, the way they (Sahaja Yogis in front) have come. On your knees, everyone. Come on your knees, everyone. I should be able to see your Kundalinis.
[Sahaja Yogis have prostrated down].
My Infinite Blessing to all of you. May Gloss Bless you all. May God Bless you all. 
Everyone's Kundalinis are "chaan" (in good shape).
Now, those who want photographs, they should declare their names here. 
Sahaja Yogi: There are so many little ones of these, Mother (photographs?)
Sahaja Yogi: The luggage of some of our foreign Sahaja Yogis which was stolen, let us give a bandhan so that it is found. 
[Photos are being distributed. Mother is instructing main centres in the district be called out and photos of Mother are handed out. Mother is personally asking for each centre by name and choosing photographs to be given. All recipients hold up the photos they have received amidst applause. ]

Shri Mataji: Has everyone received the photos of the charan?
Sahaja Yogi: We have plenty of them. We can give lots of them. We are bringing some more photos, Mother. We were keeping them for Mahashivaratri. More are coming.
Shri Mataji: Where are they?
Sahaja Yogi: They are coming. In two-three minutes.
[[Most of the centre leaders from Ahmednagar district Sangamner, Ambika Nagar, Nandgaon, Sone-Brahmni, Fatebaz etc. have received the photos. Distribution continues. Mother hands out photos as requested.]
Shri Mataji: Now, give (the remaining) to a centre each.
[Photo distribution is over. A spontaneous musical program has started. There are no musical instruments, only vocals. Sahaja Yogis are singing traditional Marathi songs and Sahaja Yoga songs in Marathi accompanied by "taal" (small handheld cymbals) and clapping hands. The singing is similar to bhajan programs common to village temples in Maharashtra].
[Song 1: The group sings, Jai Jai Jai Adishakti Hi Nirmal Naam Smarare (Glory to the Adishakti, Sing the Name Nirmal).
Song 2: A Sahaja Yogi sings a bhajan of Saint Tukaram solo.
Song 3: A Sahaja Yogi sings (an original composition or unknown origin) "Brahma, Vishnu, Panduranga", set to a popular Hindi tune, solo.
Song 4: A Sahaja Yogini sings Payasdaan from "Geet Ramayan", a contemporary Marathi musical recital of the story of Ramayana released in the eighties. It was extremely popular in Maharashtra at the time and still is.]
Shri Mataji: Voice has improved. From Sahaja Yoga. 
[Song has ended].
Shri Mataji: Now sing something about Sahaja Yoga. Come, sit here. Come here (to the female singer), sing along with them, come.
[Sahaja Yogis are discussing which song to take up next. A Sahaja Yogi says he plans to write his own compositions on Sahaja Yoga, others jocularly mention he plans to be a poet].
Shri Mataji: Sahaja Yoga has to be understood, then write about it.
Sahaja Yogi: No, Shri Mataji. In this (probably an existing song), I had an idea and I will make the changes as per that.
[Song 5: The Sahaja Yogi sings a composition "Dhanya Sharada, Brahma, Vinayaka". Mother corrects some of the wordings].
Shri Mataji: Sing Amhi Bigadhalo (after the earlier song).
Shri Mataji: Nice. He has talent.
Sahaja Yogi: And his voice is also good.
Shri Mataji: Voice is good. And he sings in tune.
[Song 6: Sahaja Yogis with the female lead sing "Nirmala Mauli Tujha Navachi Ga Sahuli" (Mother Nirmala, the comfortable shade of Your Name). 
Song 7: Sahaja Yogis sing "Charan Dharare, Aaiche He Charan Dharare" (Fall at the feet of Mother). Very catchy and in simple clapping rhythm.
Song 8: Sahaja Yogini sings "Mogara Phulala" (The jasmine flower has blossomed). A very famous composition by Sant Gyaneshwar.]
Song 9: Sahaja Yogis sing "Ughad Sahasrara Mate" (Open the Sahasrara, Mother). 
Song 10: Sahaja Yogis sing concluding song in Hindi. "Jai Jagdambe, Jai Jagdambe, Jai Ganeshji Ki Maa Ambe", (Glory to Jagadamba, Mother of Shri Ganesha).]
Sahaja Yogis: Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!
