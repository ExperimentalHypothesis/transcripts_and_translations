Talk to yogis (Hindi). Mumbay (India), 25 January 1975.

Sahaja has been created for you only. But for mankind to understand Sahaja Yoga is not so easy. Because if some very great thing is obtained effortlessly, a lacking remains for its importance, its measure, faith and devotion for that Shakti , to absorb it with complete attention within through hard work. That’s why you see that mostly Sahaja Yogis are very casual. But those other Swamis , as you know , how they put people into meditation, and how they take advantage of them. Those who take money from you, make you work hard and make you stand on your heads, make you exercise, etc. So your ego gets satisfied with it and you get stuck to it. You must have seen such people who have given their all, their money, etc and then sweep the floors for these Sadhus. The getting of Sahaja Yoga is done so effortlessly (sahaja) that people remain casual towards it. Like we got our eye so effortlessly, so we are so casual about it. We have no value that this eye is so precious. But the day we get a slight pain in the eye then we realize “O God! That is why it is so necessary to get Badhas. If there are no Badhas then Sahaja Yogis will never bother. (A person in the audience asks about Badhas). Shri Mataji answers. Badha is dependent on you. Till you catch, there is badha. What to do. There are some people who have got realization and they have gone beyond. Badha doesn’t catch them. They never get caught up. Because there are a lot of merits ( Punyas) from their past lives. But they should also be alert. They should not forget that we do not catch so we are something special. Doesn’t matter.

To be casual towards Sahaja Yoga will cost us dearly. If you are casual towards your eye then it does not matter because there is someone ready to look after your eyes, hands, feet, body. You don’t have to look after that. But you have to look after your Sahaja Yoga. There is a lot of difference between the two. Someone will look after your body, and all that is three dimensional will be looked after. But you yourself have to see to Sahaja Yoga. We have to grow in it, but we are so casual that even if a person is sitting in our neighborhood we will not talk about it. Whoever you meet, talk about it. You will have to give this dedication about Sahaja Yoga. There are many people who ... their bodies are separate.... Like yesterday, one girl had a badha and when her brother came he got his realization . In this world there are many parts of you all over, whom you have to gather. This is also a very big Sahaja Yoga. Even in your own house how can someone live without Sahaja Yoga. “If you live in my house then you all will have to come to Sahaja Yoga. You will have to get realization and keep no badha.” There should be an insistence but there is no need to get angry. You must tell them,This casualness will not do. Sahaja Yoga will have to be established with eating, waking, with every breath being taken. Because if you think of yourself as something special, if you think that your body is a temple and there is something special about it then the voice of the Temple bells must keep ringing. Otherwise it will go to waste. Sahaja Yoga can also go to waste. Please understand this. Also the second thing I better tell you that without Sahaja Yoga you now have no personality. Without it you have no blossoming. Without that you have no place. Because when you have come to the kingdom of God you will have to take its citizenship.

Yesterday one family member came and he said that yesterday I went to Gajanan Maharaj. Who is this Gajanan Maharaj? I saw that Agya Chakra, Vishuddhi chakra, three chakras were catching. He said that he catches with the photo of Gajanan Maharaj. I said here I am your sister sitting in your own house and why did you go to Gajanan Maharaj? First he said “No, he is a saint”. I said “At least check the vibrations that he is a saint or not?” They just went casually. They should also see. Is this Sahaja Yoga? After becoming a King then wanting to become a beggar, such people should be thrown out! But they said they did not become beggars deliberately. It was in casualness that they went off there. What to do, our wife is like this, what could we do.” What could we do our father is like that. Our daughter said lets go so we went”. So then they came and said “Mataji, my Agya Chakra got caught. My stomach chakra got caught.” Three chakras of theirs got caught yesterday. I am your real sister sitting here then what was the need for you to go to Gajanan Maharaj? Then they said,” Our state has gone really bad so now we will go to Sai Baba. So I told them that you better come here and then go to Sai Baba otherwise the same will happen there. What wisdom will you gain there? Thousands go there, so what is it you want there? You want material things from Sai Baba? Will these desires of human beings get fulfilled? You have got all materially. Now what is it you are wanting? You have got kingdoms, palaces now what do you want?

The one who has come to give, and what you have to get, is of great importance for humanity. God has made you with great care. All this filth which you have collected in your brain, just throw it all away! You have collected all these useless things, all this junk in this temple of yourself. Establish this temple. In every heart you have to light lamps. Purify your house, purify your family, and purify your society. You are very concerned about your relatives. Your mother in law has come I have to do for her; I have to give her.... What will your mother-in-law give you?.... She will beat you with shoes.... You must know that your relatives are the Sahaja Yogis. There are no other relatives besides Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogis are the relatives of Sahaja Yogis, because they speak another language, their ways are different; their manner is different. For this you will have to burn your life force (Prana).For this you will have to share Love. Love will flow on the edge of your Attention {Chitta}. First make your Attention alright. Make it light. If you keep everything else on your attention how will Sahaja Yoga come? It is coming down through your Attention, (Chitta) only. God is waiting to pour this into you, but where is your attention? In two minutes your attention runs here and there. Just put your attention at God’s feet. He does not want your money, wealth or anything else. Keep this all with you. This is the stupidity of humans and which you have gathered. What is the importance of all this? Give importance to your attention because it is on this attention that God will come. He has made you young like 20 year olds. Your bodies have healed; He has made your hearts Pure. Collective Consciousness has come into you. Now what? You are still running after this or the other. You consider all those things more important. In your past lives you had earned all this rubbish and left it all behind. Now again you will collect all this wealth and you will again leave it all behind. To live casually for a Sahaja Yogi is a very dangerous thing. What we call as carelessness. There is a great war going on. You know how other ways and methods have got started for destruction.

Sahaja Yoga is like a lotus standing in these murky waters. Delicate, Fragrant, Beautiful, and you are the petals of that lotus. Any filth which falls on you will just slide off when you get to know that you are lotuses. So if any chakra is catching then get rid of the filth. You are lotuses; you have been made into lotuses so if any filth falls onto the lotus then the lotus should just throw it off. Each one of you will have to be awakened towards Sahaja Yoga if you have to take the boat of Sahaja Yoga across. Don’t sit with your tiny and petty problems of your relatives, homes, and your small petty questions. Till when are you going to keep hanging on to this filth. None of these lot is going to side with you. Will my son or daughter get married? Etc.... If it happens fine and if it doesn’t then fine also. You will spend money there, try and get a name there ... And for Sahaja Yoga?.... You have no time for Sahaja Yoga. The big thing is that people in India do not have too much money. Their own monetary condition is not too good. But we must know that in this India there are VIBRATIONS which control everything. Any other country would have collapsed by now. You are living because of the support of vibrations. What a great country this is. What a country you are born in. You know this. I don’t know how to tell the foreigners about the Importance of the Devi. They don’t know what is the Devi , what is the Mother. They are such dirty people who don’t understand the relationship of the mother, I feel like crying. And you people have become so casual like you shave your beard you meditate in the same way. How is this going to happen?!

My brothers tell me, “Why are you killing yourself from morning to evening. Something might go wrong with your health, and then what will your husband tell us? You sleep at 4-5 am, day long you are working so hard, why are you doing this, what are you going to get by this?” I can fight alone but what benefits are you all going to get by it? To be casual, to live casually, it is a dismal attitude towards yourself. It is your own insult. It is like a king who has got all the wealth and he is living casually. Arre, Rule, Ascend the throne! Are you going to finish off Sahaja Yoga by taking up petty little things?! Clean your insides; clean your heart. Leave this cunningness and clean your heart and see if we are sitting in innocence ? You are doing me no favor. What you were seeking from lifetimes you are getting that only. Now that you have come to the last stage , then what is this crazy behavior?! You may not have seen the one who has come to the last stage, but I have seen many like that. First I have to get them stuck to it. Stick ! Stick! Stick!

Sometimes you have such thoughts,”That what can we do, our country is so bad, and we are so poor here, and what good can we do to our country!” Good that you don’t have money. I have given realization to so many people who are rich. Where are they? Just two or three?! And they too are such misers. There is no one here with too much money. I have given Realisation to people with lakhs and crores. What are they doing! Good there is not so much money and its nuisance! Good that this money is not stuck to you. You have less money which is really good. I have seen these rich, so called, these ministers, they have no joy like you people have. They got their realization and then just sat down very nicely! There they will sit with money! Big ministers, secretaries have got realization! What have they done? God protect us from their Egos! Who is a secretary or a king with God! Answer this. Is Shri Mataji right?

It is such an important day. Who am I before you? Go where you go for your Pujas to these temples! Are they going to come on this earth?!! Get your own temple ready. These little children who just came in are more lucky and blessed than you people. They are beyond money, positions and all this foolishness. They just want Mataji. Yesterday some of these children had come and they pleaded with their mothers to let them be at my program for a longer time. I was not giving them any chocolate or anything like that but they wanted to sit more with Mataji. They understand more than you people. Leave your past and become like children. You have become like children. What a beautiful form! You too were like this my children. You all were like this. Where have you got lost and become disfigured? Be afraid of your ugliness. Look at the beauty of others. When I will go away....when the mother leaves then it is the duty of the children to look after the house. When I come back I see that my children have been spreading Sahaja Yoga. But here when I come I see that 8-10 people have their Agyas caught up, some others have their Nabhi caught up and yet others have Vishuddhi caught up. Someone went to someone else ( guru), while others have fallen sick, someone is in bad shape, someone’s wife is in hospital and another has gone to the lunatic asylum. Oh, what happened! And dont think you are small people. You are very Great people. All these big people are of no use. They don’t get their realization. Know your greatness and then talk. Open yourself and talk. One who speaks even one word in Sahaja Yoga, then Saakshat Saraswati herself will come and sit there. I am telling you. Just speak and then see. Just start talking about Sahaja Yoga and you will see Saraswati coming into your Voice. Start writing about it and She will come into your writings. Take up any work in Sahaja and Saakshaat Hanuman is standing and he tells me, “Mother, With whom should I stand?” Hanumanji is doing all your work. Take up any work in the name of your Mother, even of work of the world. For Sahaja Yoga the five Immortals (Chiranjeevs) are standing there for you. All these deities are ready with their Shaktis standing in the background for you. And what do they see that the actor who has come is in very bad shape. He is looking here and there. How will the drama go on? This half baked attitude won’t do.

“Mataji, I don’t get time to sit for meditation”. What do you mean that you get no time? What is time meant for? Who has given you this time? If you have no time for yourself then how will you get time for God? How do you get no time! You should wake up at 4am. You have seen your Mother. How many hours does She sleep? Wake up at 4 in the morning. Tell yourself. You have to go into meditation from 4 to 5 am. Throw away your sleep! Give up keeping awake in the night. Stop talking with useless people. Stop these useless associations, these relatives, all these useless people. All these are bhoots. Have we come here to waste our time on these people? I don’t spend even one moment on telling you about Sahaja Yoga. Not even one moment. I have to meet thousands of people from my husband’s office with whom I have to shake hands at receptions; I use it for giving realization. They shake hands and I give them realization. I see that he has got realization and I feel like laughing. Whichever country I go to I keep giving realization. Whoever I speak to I keep giving realization. He keeps talking and I keep on giving realization. He goes on talking about his own things. Where I get a chance I keep giving realization. On Victoria station a Pakistani Muslim was collecting tickets. The line was very long and I was giving realization to him standing in the line and also to the people standing in the line in front of me. Just as he gave me the ticket and looked at Me he got his realization. He gave all their tickets and came and sat in my compartment, where I sitting alone. He asked” Who are you?” How do you have such an attraction?” I asked who he was. He said he is Hussain. So I told him to sit down and put his hands towards Me. He says’” What is this happening? Cool?” “Who are You?” I said, “See and recognize.”

I went to Rome, where many artists were sitting and painting something. I gave one realization, then he got up and said something to the one next to him, and then came and caught hold of my feet and started crying bitterly, saying” Mother, When did You come?”. I had gone there as the wife of a big officer with three or four official people standing beside me. They all got embarrassed wondering what he is doing. He started saying,” Mother, I have found You. In the night You had come in my dreams and said that I will wear such and such sari and You have come in the same sari.”

Even a moment I think of nothing but Sahaja Yoga. I have forgotten all the past. I have had big births, big people. I have forgotten all the past and future. In this moment I remember only Sahaja Yoga and nothing else. In the same way you people should think of Sahaja Yoga only at each moment. Wherever you sit there should be Sahaja Yoga. Throw away your watches! Throw away this servitude to watches! Sahaja Yoga is your watch. If it is 12:30 it does not matter. It is 3 am. You are sitting in Sahaja Yoga. Is Sahaja Yoga the servant of a watch or time! We are not servants of any laws or rituals. We are standing only in Sahaja Yoga. We keep sitting even if it takes time. Are we some servants of our stomachs! We are servants of no one. Everything keeps happening. It has to happen. Throw away this servitude to all your old bindings! Throw away your watches! There is no system made for anything. In Sahaja Yoga there can never be a system. It makes its own system. Let it be made. If you try and make systems then it will be destroyed. Don’t make disciplines. Let the discipline of Sahaja Yoga keep moving within you. Yes for those who have not got their realization for them the discipline is important. You do that. But those who have got realization such people have to get their own discipline inside. The discipline will come by itself within. Sahaja Yogis have an inbuilt discipline. There is no forgiveness for this. The one who is not a Sahaja Yogi should be forgiven because he does not understand what discipline is. He only knows the worldly discipline of the stick. Let the discipline come from within and awaken from within for Sahaja Yogis. See how much you are moving in the discipline of Sahaja. You are moving with its hand and feet and rising with its waves. How much is the discipline tied with the waves of an ocean? You can tell sitting here at what time low tide or high tide will come in London. Who has tied its discipline that you have started tying other’s discipline! Learn to step into the discipline of the within. Learn to move in the directions and methods of within. Its methods are moving. Don’t make your own. Make your own this that, ’Lets get more into Sahaja, spend time for Sahaja.’ If you have to wear watches then wear it for Sahaja yoga. If you have to put alarm then let it be for Sahaja Yoga.
(to a person who just entered). Come and sit. You are all within my heart. Are you far away?! You must understand this.

Even one leaf in this world cannot move without His discipline. Blend yourself in His discipline and merge in with His harmony. Harmonize yourself totally. When it rises you rise when it falls you fall. When we try to do our own thing then we are left behind. Keep molding yourself with it. This can happen only through Sahaja Yoga and not through any worldly things.

There is only one way which I have said a thousand times and I am saying again that your fortress is Thoughtlessness!( Nirvicharita ). Know in Thoughtless Awareness and you will know everything. Anything you have to do, go into Thoughtlessness. Once you do all worldly works in thoughtless awareness then you will know that how dynamic it has become. Who has seen flowers bloom or become fruits? Who has seen the living work of this world? It is being done. You are moving in the dynamism and in this living thing. It is coming from thoughtlessness. When you sit there the whole world becomes pale. Try to make a habit of remaining in Thoughtlessness. Every work is done through thoughtlessness and so will yours. Your movement within has to be done by you. There is no age limit for this, that we have become old. You are not old. You have been reborn hardly 3-4 years ago. You are just small little children. It is not a question of age. One should remain in Thoughtlessness. This is your place, your wealth, your strength (Shakti). This is your form. This is your beauty. This is your life. Thoughtless! As soon as you are thoughtless the outside methods, the whole of it starts moving in your hands. Live in thoughtlessness. Over there, there is no Time, no Direction, nor can anyone touch it. There is only a vision of the Living. There is only a vision of Life and how it blooms. There is vision of its Beauty, its Capability, its Prosperity and it’s Truth. Watch it from where the stream of life is flowing.

But when you become brainless, or extremely stupid, then how will It show you? Or to be heartless, without love, selfish, self centered, to be ugly, to do atrocities, to keep on thinking about yourself, to think that you are something very great, then how will It show you the way. In the movement of Sahaja Yoga there should be such beauty .While doing it there should be tremendous faith. When raising the Kundalini there should be so much Devotion that it is like you are praying to the Kundalini or Mother of another. There should be great respect for that state, so much thought about it. In everything, in your behavior, your talk, the way you talk, in your touch, your laughter, and your tears. In everything there should be such a vision of your heart. It is massive. This massiveness should show from within you. There should be a Vision of the Skies within you. The Purity of Water should reflect from within you. The Brilliance of the Sun should show from your face, the Coolness of the Moon should flow from within you. Flowing everywhere, you should be like the Wind. Your breath is beating in everyone at this time. Know this! Don’t play with your life. By being extremely reverent and humble just accept it, the new life the Divine is putting within us. May you accept his Grace, His Love. You don’t need to bathe or wash your hands for it, you need to do nothing but clean your heart. Clean your heart. “O God, Please clean our hearts and make us leave our cunning and deceitful ways. Clean your hearts as He is going to descend in the lotus of your hearts. Clean your hearts. Are our hearts clean? Who are you deceiving? To whom are you telling lies? You are all one. I can never say to one person only. I am speaking to each one of you that you are all in one body; and that too in my body. You are my projection. I am telling myself. To whom else shall I say? Who is the other? When you are sick I feel pain within just like I myself have got sick. And when you are happy then I feel tremendous joy just like I have myself become happy. When you are unhappy then I too don’t enjoy any joy. I keep awake night and day for you.
Whatever or whichever way you can do, one must give time, give full time. Now we are going to make an ashram, so the ones who have money can give money. You will have to give. You spend money here and there. Of what use has it been your spending money here and there. I don’t need your money. I need nothing. I don’t need to spend anywhere. This ashram is being made for you, your brothers and sisters, who are going to live there. Now these realized children are being born, they need a school and someone who can look after them. Give money for that. How will the money come? Any money that comes from you is very important. Such people come here who do not want to spend even one rupee. There are not such poor people here. If that is the case then it is alright. But those who cannot give even one rupee can such people be Sahaja Yogis? I get really amazed that they trouble for giving one rupee or five rupees! You will have to give in thousands. Who has given you this money? I don’t want it. What can you give me! At least give for yourself, for your children, for your benefit. Tomorrow you yourself will come and live in those ashrams, I know it. There is no need to be such misers or be freeloaders. Live like Kings. Just like I don’t eat for free you should also not eat for free. Whoever can do, do. One who has time, give time. One who can work, then work. One who has to give realization, then give realization, one has to take out the bhoots then take out the bhoots. Do for Sahaja Yoga. You will have to. Without doing so your ego will not die, and neither will your super ego die unless and until you do not do something for Sahaja Yoga. Again your Agya will catch. “Mataji, my head is caught.” “ Mataji my daughter ran away.” “ Mataji, such and such happened to my father”. It will happen. I don’t do anything. The Ganas don’t do anything. Wherever you have a weakness, there only the Bhoots will catch you. They don’t catch Me. Why don’t they catch Me?

What has Mataji given us! She has given so much to someone else. Arre! He had to get so he got it. What you have got is no less. You have no value for what you have got. There should be a satisfaction within. Catch hold of that Satisfaction. Stand in that satisfaction. How can I tell you? There are also computers and points about this. Press the Satisfaction key and Satisfaction gets awakened within. Press another key and your Innocence will awaken. Press another and Truth will awaken. This is all within you. By pressing the fingers the whole program can get set. But first at least there should be innocence. There should be some satisfaction otherwise when you press the finger what will come out? Vacuum?! One who has pressed Satisfaction has arrived at Satisfaction. They have arrived at wealth. They are sitting in wealth. Some have collected your wealth from years by burning your bodies for years and are now standing before you. In the same way you must collect things one by one. Satisfaction. Come into Innocence, Come into Wealth, Come into Beauty. Come into Truth. Come into Love. All the buttons are there.

How are we going to do it, how will we do it?! There is no word like ‘How will we’ in Sahaja Yoga. Whatever you want to earn you can within yourself. You can earn satisfaction within yourself; you can earn everything within yourself. Press the button and whatever you want will keep on coming to you. You will become a machine within. I can’t understand how to get that attainment within you and join you.

Let us now go into Meditation.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
