Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Workshop for beginners

You have to know that you all have been seekers before this is not the first time you have been seeking. So already you have reached a certain state where you feel and you are aware that something more has to happen to you, you are already ready for that, some of you have really taken birth in this time just for this.
So, because I’m not going to talk of your past, past is over now, we have to think of the present. One has to know that all of you, got Realization, some people have certain problems, on their different centers as I told you, different types of problems people have.
Because of these problems, the Kundalini goes back to its attention because Kundalini has to look after your problems. She’s your mother so she goes there, attends to that problem and again she rises. But only thing you have to learn, how to make her rise, how to cooperate with her, how to understand your own problem and give additional help to solve the problem.
Now you will be amazed that you just get rid of your false identifications with yourself. You become absolutely detached from that, because you start talking in the language of chakras and centers. You start saying that, "This center is bad, that center is bad, this is not alright Mother, that’s wrong with me, that is wrong with me", that’s all. You don’t say I’ve cancer, you don’t say I’m mad, you don’t say I’m egoistical. You just say : “Mother this center is not alright, that center is not alright.” Depending on the quality of your centers, the chakras, as -they are, the ones who really are the channels for the energy of God to flow in. Regarding them, you have to be careful, how your chakras are. Are you clean or not? Some of you will find cool breeze flowing alright in the hand, but may be, one chakra is catching. On one chakra you will feel the heat, or you may feel the numbness, you might feel also a kind of a – we can say a kind of a tingling on certain fingers.
Now wherever there is tingling, you must know there is a kind of a struggle going on between those chakras and the Kundalini. So you should just try to help your chakras, to awaken them and also must know that every one of you are part and parcel of the whole. You are awakened now, you are awakened to that part and so you have to be more careful. Because if you suffer from some chakra, I can feel it. But if others, those who are not Realized, I don’t feel it at all, I’m not bothered, There can be any number of devils or anything, doesn’t matter to me. But if you people, who are Realized souls, have a slight problem immediately I know that you have this problem, my attention is diverted to that. So you must understand that the attention is all the time there to look after you, to give you a better guidance, your Spirit is all the time working. But you must learn how to take the guidance from your Spirit that’s the main point; so nobody is lower or higher as he said. I’ve seen some people who were declared as drunkards, this, that, overnight, there are finished [with that], they are perfect people, not only, but very good Sahaja Yogis.
So, you see, all these clouds have come on the sky of your being in this life time, doesn’t matter, makes no difference, but your past is great, that shows. So you don’t have to worry as to how far you are where you are, there’s no degree or anything to measure it. They must be all aware already, otherwise you would not come to me, first of all. And to get Realization itself, is very big.
Now there’s a very good seeker I know of, who came to me, and he got his Realization but he did not feel it on his hand, because he has a very bad Vishuddhi. And with a bad Vishuddhi chakra, you may not feel it in your hand, doesn’t matter, but you’ll feel peaceful, you’ll feel joyful. And you can feel it on top of your head, or others can feel it. Gradually your fingers will start improving and they will give you better results.
For example, people who do hard work with their hands, also their fingers can be numbed, so we have to use certain methods, like looking after our hands. This body now is a temple of God so we have to look after it in a way, respectfully, not for the way the - you see, the prostitutes, when they want to sell their body they look after their body. No, but respect, with respect to our body.
We have to look after ourselves in a way that we should keep good health. And to keep good health in Sahaja Yoga, there are thousand and one things, which you have to know, which is very easy to understand, and which will be told to you for no price at all, nothing. It is the Divine that is anxious that you should get it, that you should settle down, that you should enjoy. So you don’t have to be so anxious about it. These anxieties must be given up, just try to understand your centers.

Now many of you did feel the cool breeze. But may be, after some time, you may lose it, doesn’t matter. You’ll go up and down, like that, doesn’t matter. It does not mean that you’ve lost it, not at all. Now supposing you try a method, a simple method, that you first put your left hand towards my photograph - just now you can try – and right hand on the Mother Earth, let’s see. Right hand on the Mother Earth, that’s why I wanted to have it in the open, but doesn’t matter now, this rain is good for you for the farmers, let’s have it. So now put your left hand like this, and right hand - those who are sitting can put up like that [towards the sky]. Like this. Back [the palm of the hand towards Shri Mataji's rear]. Right hand like this, right. Not left, right. Sahaja Yogi : ...the ground. No like this. Shri Mataji : Back. Yes, right hand. Now what we are doing, the left hand side power, is the emotional power. Now if you have an emotional problem – say, somebody has been taking drugs, he’s a left sided person. Some drugs are, LSD and all that right-sided, but most of the drugs take you to the left side. Gurus are left sided part. Most of these problems are mental problems, are left sided problems. But the problem of the intellectuals is right sided, futuristic people is right sided. People who are running the rat race are right sided, you see, that kind of over activity, that kind of things. On the contrary, those who have taken to drugs are left sided. So first try with the left, let’s see. Now put your right hand on the Mother Earth. Put your right hand on the Mother Earth. Now, put your left hand towards Me. Gradually, you’ll find it will start flowing in your left hand. Is it flowing? Put your right hand on the Mother Earth, because the Mother Earth takes away; you see, you are just earthing it, put it on it, touching it, touch, touch it, you see, you are earthing yourself, is a very simple thing. Now left sided problems easily go to Mother Earth, it’s true, but the best is to have a light. Now, say, if you have a candle, candle is the best, for left sided problems, candle is the best thing to take it. Because left sided problems, we can say, are cold problems, or problems which arise from coldness. You see, a person who becomes inactive. Now see. You just put your left hand towards me like this and right hand towards a candle. You ‘ll be amazed, sometimes, the candle starts burning “tac” and drop like that and sometimes it creates such black smoke that, if it is next to a wall, you might find the all wall becoming black. It’s very interesting to see how the candle reacts, but you must have a photograph in front. And there should be a candle before the photograph and one candle like this to take it out. Right, now, see better? All right? You’ll feel it’s going down. You’ll feel from your head, you’ll feel, you see, the pressure is going down. Better now? Like this. Put the hand like that, back side, not towards me, like that yes, yes. Now. Hum. Now put left hand, if you ‘re sitting on the ground, it’s better to put towards me, left hand. It’s coming, it’s going, it’s working. It’s like the energy, you see, that is coming through the photograph, it’s pushing it down towards the light, and the light burns it off: light gets awakened, by you. It’s surprising but it does. It’s better now? See. We work out, we feel it. You will feel it yourself, there is nothing to certify. You will feel yourself. Put your left hand towards me, left hand towards me like this, yes. You all will feel it yourself. Now people who have been to gurus, who have sort of schizophrenic attitude, who are moody people, frantic, fits, they get all sorts of these, to extreme to the least you see, who are emotional, some women who cry too much, hysterics, all those things can be controlled by this simple method of putting left hand towards the photograph and right hand towards a candle. See, it’s working out? You’ll feel the movement in your head you’ll feel, Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: Feeling it now. No? Sahaja Yogi: So, it’s not there. Shri Mataji: Now with the right hand side now, those who are running the rat race, you see big people who think they must earn money and all, they are running in the politics and all that kind of a - another madness they have. You see, that’s also a kind of madness, you see. [Shri Mataji laughs] So for such people who are having a high blood pressure because of that, they will have diabetes, they’ll have liver trouble. Now even for any organ, you see, any organ you take, say heart, in Sahaja Yoga we have for every organ, two types of nature. One is the one that is lethargic and another that is overactive. So supposing you are an overactive person, then if you are an overactive person, you are studying very hard or thinking about the future or planning something, then, you have a heart which is overactive. Or you have an intestine which is overactive. Your liver is overactive, the all system is overactive, you’ll have high blood pressure and all the problems of high blood pressure, constipation, all these things go hand in hand in one personality. Then, another personality could be a lethargic. A person who has a lethargic heart, may get a- has to get a bypass or something like that, because the heart doesn’t pump. You may have a lethargic intestine, such a person might – whatever he eats you see, just goes to the bathroom, sort of a thing or may be a lethargic liver. When you have a lethargic liver then you might get allergies. Allergies are caused by lethargic liver. But, if you are an overactive person, if you are overactive, then the same liver which was giving you these allergies, will give you nausea, a feeling of a sickness, migraine, and vomiting, big emesis. So there are two types of livers also. We have two types of kidneys, two types of, everything is two types. So if you are a lethargic person, if you have a lethargic problem, then what you have to do is to use the light. For all the lethargic troubles, best is the light, to use the light for lethargic troubles, this is left side. And for the right sidedness, you can use the Mother Earth. Mother Earth is the best or water and salt. So water and salt is very good for people who are suffering from an over-activity. Now how do you do it? It’s good for both, but specially for them. Like you have to put both the hands first towards the photograph, put both the feet in the water, with little salt. Now if you are feeling the vibrations coming in both the hands, equally the same, it’s alright, you don’t have to worry. But supposing, one hand is more and one hand is less. The hand that is less has to go before the photograph, always. The hand that is less has to go towards the photograph and another one has to go out. And you’ll be amazed, the movement of the thing, you will feel within yourself these balloons [of ego and superego in the head]  will be moving like that [from right to left and from left to right]. And you can feel it, that something is moving in your head, you are getting relaxed. And gradually, you’ll become a master, you will know how to handle this body, absolutely, you‘ll become a master. And when you become master – people have become masters in eight days, in eight days. Once you become a master, then you can handle other bodies also and help other people. It’s as simple as that. So forget about the past, now the present, we have to be in the present.

Is there any other question now? Sahaja Yogi : ... about mantras... Shri Mataji : Mantras, yes. Now, we have got different centers, and all these centers have got different deities. As I told you, Lord Jesus Christ is here [Shri Mataji shows the Agnya chakra] Moses is here [Shri Mataji shows the upper part of the Void, a bit on the left] Krishna is here [Shri Mataji shows the center Vishuddhi]. We have a chart of that. We have books which will be given to you. Now, we have to make, you see- Sahaja Yogi : Excuse me. [Sahaja Yogi brings a big chart] Shri Mataji : Yes this is the chart, you see, it’s beautifully done, this one is very clear cut. Now on different chakras, we have different deities - come forward, you come forward and see, all right? All right, just let him see. You can pass it on. Sahaja Yogi : May be there’s another chart. Shri Mataji : Another chart, all right. We have books, you see, why not give them books? Sahaja Yogi : ...They can have the other books Shri Mataji : Open the books, you have got the chart in the books. Can you see? Now gradually you see, we are trying to get a bigger place for you, and we should really meet in a hall again. When are you going to - Sahaja Yogi :... they can meet here first until we get a hall Shri Mataji : Yes if you want, we might not be able to get but you can meet here. You can always come and find out. Now, what is it? There are books. Now, I’ll show. These are small books just meant for the beginner, you see. Now here, this is all given in short. Now this is the chart you have to follow – you can pass it on...Give this to that gentleman also he wanted. Ah, you’ve got. Gentleman : I got it here. Shri Mataji : Oh I see. You also take. Now. So the mantras are according to the chakra that is in problem. Supposing your Nabhi chakra is not all right. All right? And if you start saying the mantra of this one [Shri Mataji shows the Agnya chakra] is no use. So you must know what center is catching, from your fingers. Now you can make out here, in this chart if you see on this side, we have got written the numbers according to the centers. On this side, if you see it clearly? Now these are the numbers of the centers, all right? So then, and also here it is written in this chart, what are the different deities. Now, all these deities should be first understood, where are they, and when you have to say the mantras, what you have to do is call [?] it into a proper Sahaja Yoga mantra – so have you given that? Sahaja Yogi : It’s not in these books.. Shri Mataji : But they will tell you. The pattern has to be like this, which says, whatever is the thing is, is woven into the complete- I mean you are to be recommended, isn’t it? Somebody has to say. So you have to say that I am the one who has given you this knowledge. So just you have to use that particular thing which they will give you, the pattern, which is very simple. And you have to use these names of these deities, different deities according, and gradually you’ll be amazed that it will work out. But when you come here, they will tell you, it’s very simple, it’s very simple. But you must know where the chakras are. First of all, you must become sensitive. So I would suggest that you must start using olive oil for your fingers and for your toes, you see, rub it nicely, make your fingers sensitive. Because of various things, our hands have become gross, you see. To feel it better, use some nice olive oil, massage it nicely. And sometimes, if you wear the gloves in the night, they can soften it also. You must soften, soft hands are better. And the nails should not be very long, not very badly cut, sort of things you see, and they are to be properly done. So that when you use on others, they should not feel hurt with your nails. But for yourself also, you should not have very –right hand specially – because you’ll have to use it like this here, say, you have a [problem of] Vishuddhi chakra [Shri Mataji does like working on Her Vishuddhi Chakra by giving a bandhan there with Her index of right hand], then you’ll have to use your Nabhi chakra like that [using the middle finger?] So what, actually, is the matter with you, is to be first realized. So first you have to understand yourself, what is your problem, what you are suffering from, and then, how to correct it. If you could find out how to correct it and what is your problem, then it is the easiest thing, is to find a mantra to improve yourself. All right? It’s very simple. Now you have met me only a day back, I should say, but you’ll be amazed the knowledge that you will have now about yourself, will be tremendous. So first is Self Realization, means you know yourself. Once you know yourself, you start knowing others, because we are all collectively conscious. Those who are Realized souls become aware of others. So first of all, if you want to see your own vibrations, you have to put yourself into bandhan like this, as I told you, like this. Now, let’s do it. Put your left hand towards me. Sahaja Yogi : Like this towards Shri Mataji...[makes the bandhan 7 times] Shri Mataji : Now, these are your vibrations, whatever it is, now check, see now. Which finger is burning? See, carefully. Now this is left Nabhi. Now which one is burning, be careful. Pay attention. Shri Mataji : Which one? New Sahaja Yogi : [Inaudible].... Shri Mataji : Here? [Mother shows Mooladhara on right hand] Maybe he is constipated, is he? Does he get constipation? New Sahaja Yogini : [Inaudible].... Shri Mataji : Yes, it’s the liver, sign of liver [Mother shows central finger on right hand], you see, and also constipated. So he is more a right sided person, because the right side is this thing. So he has to put left to the right, like this. All right? New Sahaja Yogi : I’m just warm and sticky, what could that mean? Shri Mataji : You have a heart [problem] New Sahaja Yogi : It’s an allergy [?] Shri Mataji : You put your right hand on your heart. New Sahaja Yogini : [Inaudible].... Rather warm. SHir Mataji : Warm? All right, doesn’t matter, and the other one? Nothing. All right. So put your left to the right. Left to the right. Sahaja Yogi : You take it- when She says left to the right, what you’re doing is not just this one, but directly lifting the left side Shri Mataji : And taking the grace from the right. Sahaja Yogi : You came across, you lift the left side again,  because you’re balancing Shri Mataji : And taking the grace, you see, on the right side [Shri Mataji is doing a bandhan from the left to the right], because right side is showing nothing. If the right side is showing nothing, then what you are doing, you are lifting your left which is slightly showing and you take up and bring it down, with your right hand. Left to the right. Sahaja Yogi : If you got problems on the right side, if you got problems in your right fingers, any of them of your hand, ... you take from the left side, and over the top and you bring down the grace into the right side. OK. Then it’s the opposite, it’s as simple as that. Shri Mataji : If she’s not- if you are not feeling at all on right hand, then you have right hand problem. You’re not feeling any vibrations, hum? And left hand, you are feeling what? Sahaja Yogi : Slightly warm on the left side.... So he has to go from right to left. Just do it yourself now, get into balance that’s the object of what Shri Mataji is saying. New Sahaja Yogini : Can we change hands? Shri Mataji : Yes you can, you change hands. Sahaja Yogi : Just to repeat it... bring down the grace into the right side... Shri Mataji : Right to the left. You take your right hand and put it like that. Sahaja Yogi : If you got it in the other direction.. you go the other way... until it balances... Shri Mataji : Did you come to my program before? New Sahaja Yogi : No Shri Mataji : That’s why. Just it has started, you see, you have to get your Realization first of all, all right? You come here. We’ll have to work it out, first of all, as your Realization has not worked out, that’s why. It just started. Hum? Let us work out. If the Realization works out, then only you can feel it properly. That’s why. Right side, not at all, so I was wondering why. Shri Mataji : Are you feeling ? [to someone else] Good. Left hand what are you feeling? Cool breeze in the left hand and not on the right. All right. So what you do is to take left to the right. [Shri Mataji shows once more] No, with the right hand. New Sahaja Yogini : Oh, yes. Shri Mataji : Gradually when you practice you will know. Better now? Good? Good. Is all right. [Shri Mataji answers the same questions again and again] Shri Mataji : How are you feeling now? New Sahaja Yogini : How long does that type of things ..? Shri Mataji : Split of a second. New Sahaja Yogini : How long will it last, balancing yourself? Sahaja Yogi : How long will the balancing last you? Shri Mataji : Last? I mean there is no timing for it. It can last you forever, but if you are a very wobbly type, it may a little bit drop on, but you have to know how to do it, you see? Now, we can say we are driving a car. Now, how long will it last there? As long as you keep it. You are driving this car [Shri Mataji shows Her body] all right? Now, what is it? Are you feeling the balance now? New Sahaja Yogini : I? Yes. Shri Mataji : Good, then it’s good. Sahaja Yogi : When it becomes imbalanced, that’s when you correct it. New Sahaja Yogini : So, just through the day, you just have to Shri Mataji : No, no, no, no, no, no. Now, if you’re in balance, there is nothing wrong, it’s all right, perfectly all right. Sahaja Yogi : Can you get it when you haven’t had the Realization. You mean the balancing? Shri Mataji : Have you got your Realization? That is the first, that’s the first thing. Otherwise you have not entered into the kingdom of God, isn’t it? First thing is to have your Realization and then, now, put your hands towards me. You got the cool breeze in your hands, are you feeling? Started. Close your eyes. What about you? No. Sahaja Yogi : Those who haven’t their Realization, put their hands up please. Shri Mataji : You come forward. I think best is- and the rest of the Sahaja Yogis can see. Come along. Now these people can be taught by Sahaja Yogis how to give Realization, you are all right, three of you, go ahead. [People move] And the Sahaja Yogis can meet them and talk to them. Sit down, sit down. [Cut in the video. Shri Mataji holds a candle in front of Her face.] Shri Mataji : Are you feeling? Do like that with your eyes, do a little bit. Just press them, press your eyes hard, any hard- thrice. Hard, press them hard, thrice. All right? Not yet? It will come. It will work out. Watch me, watch me here. [Shri Mataji still holds a candle in front of Her face, then in front of her right hand and the new now realized people are sent to another room where Sahaja Yogis will work on them.]

Please take the baby out a little bit, because everybody tries to meditate.

All right, just for a minute, just a little bit. Don’t feel guilty, none of you should feel guilty. Everybody has certain problems still. You just go and say: "Mother I am not guilty". Close your eyes, just close your eyes. There is nothing to feel guilty about anything whatsoever. Whatever you have done is finished now. You are entering into new awareness now, into the kingdom of God. Now you have become the spirit, and spirit cannot be guilty.

Forget about the people who have not come today with you. Anyone. Just forget them. Just start to be yourself. They can come later on and you can give them the full advantage.

Those who have got liver problem should take sugar and they’ll tell you what is to be done. If you have got diabetes you must take salt. And for other people who have arthritis and all that also, I’ll ask you to bring some petrol or kerosene on, if not you can come back again and take it from these people.

Thank you very much. Enjoy your life.

May God bless you!
