耶诞崇拜

印度普尼‧1986年12月25日

今天,我们都期待庆祝主耶稣基督的降生。这个地方有很重要的象征性意义,这里有耶稣出生时的小屋,风从四方八面吹进来,因此屋内很难保持温暖。若祂不在十二月出生这个说法是正确的,祂出生在温暖的月份,不那么冷,或许不是你知道的那样,或许今天的气候是颇重要,祂必定也感到这种气候。对你们而言,这种气候,这种环境,这种简朴的生活,你感觉不感到任何不舒适。祂从没有感到不舒适,祂的母亲也没有。

当我们的注意力在灵上,就不会感到大自然或世俗的事物为我们带来的不舒适。当霎哈嘉瑜伽士开始投诉不舒适,就是他仍未是霎哈嘉瑜伽士的第一个征兆。首先,我们要完全适应这种气候,享受这种风格,享受这个速度,享受它用这种途径打造我们。大自然与我们的肉体并无冲突,因为灵是同步的装置,它帮助你与大自然合一,享受大自然最精彩的部分。你享受大自然,就显示你是伟大的瑜伽士,这是归功于我,我想,你们都已经视不舒适为享受。

基督的降临是件大事,就如我曾经告诉你,是为了建立额轮。祂出生在地球的时间比祂的意识出生早得多,这个绝对的意识以耶稣基督的形相出生。只有你是有自觉的灵才能解释祂的一生,不然你不能解释基督 — 祂是谁,祂如何成就事情— 你也知道,很多事情仍很难在霎哈嘉瑜伽中解释,你只是不停的看到事情发生。今天,你看到湖中有喷泉涌出,没有人能解释为何会这样,即使工程师也解释不了,没有人能解释为何会这样,它就是发生了,水受激发,感受到上天,就开始活泼地倾泻它的爱,你能想象即使水也能感觉到它吗?

你曾经看过光怎样能感觉到它,同样,每一种元素都能感觉到它。这些元素全都在你内里,我们可以说,最高的要算是光,因为光有效用,它受耶稣基督管理。光有效用,光显示正确的事物,亦是它令我们明白世俗事物的不同面向角度,最终,光来自灵,灵开悟了光,你开始看到事物的不同角度,这样有时会令你发笑,有时会令你微笑,有时也会令你哭泣。你透过霎哈嘉瑜伽已经成就了这个漂亮的面向,全在你内在构建好,你要达致它。另一方面,人们要努力工作,就如耶稣基督出生在小马槽里,这显示神圣不需要出生在皇族,可以出生在马槽里,也可以出生在任何地方,对神圣而言,这是毫无分别的。

但这样却令人有很可笑的想法,他们说..我们要令自己悲惨不快,我们要把拥有的一切都捐献给神。神不需要这些,祂亦不能拥有这些,你不能给予什么。你要成为贫民,把一切都捐献给神是错误的想法。神不要这些,祂只要你快乐、喜乐、享受,这些才是重点。还有是若你给少许,给神少许,祂会以百倍回报。这就是为何你只要给神少许物品。你不用把自己挂在树上来证明你想牺牲。基督已经为我们做了一切,这是祂一生漂亮之处,就是从祂出生开始,祂已经向人展示,祂享受没有物质的舒适 — 我们称为的物质。祂从未享受过我们所知的世俗事物,这只是说明,祂为我们这样做,是让我们明白,不用追求世俗的事物 — 它们会追求我们。你不用担忧这些事,你只要担忧你的灵,灵是最重要的。

我要说,祂的生命很短暂,祂都在尝试,祂对评价人很感兴趣,因为祂不知道这些人类是什么,对人类而言,祂是外来的,所以祂想作出评估。在评估中,祂说了很多了不起的事情,我们要明白祂的话,其一是祂说不要把珍珠抛给不想明白你的人。对霎哈嘉瑜伽士而言,最重要的是要明白,你不应向反神的人谈霎哈嘉瑜伽。他或许是你的兄弟,或许是你的姊妹,或许是你的父亲,或许是任何人,不用说服他们有关霎哈嘉瑜伽,因为他们不是你的亲人。很多人只担忧怎样说服自己的丈夫,或兄弟,你完全不用说服他们,只要放弃他们就可以了。

祂告诉我们其中一件事情,我认为这件事很重要的,就是我们要宽恕,祂已经给了我们最了不起的武器,就是「宽恕」。宽恕是那么实际。你只要宽恕,这个人就不再存在,他不再麻烦你,亦不再在你的注意力下,宽恕是最简单不过,亦是我们能做到,最能解脱折磨我们的世俗事物或思维的方法。

祂的一生是灵性的故事,祂经历各种混乱,各种折磨,灵能经历的各种麻烦,这显示没有人能杀掉灵,就如博伽梵歌说..Nainam chidanti shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah, na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati marutah。不能杀掉它,它是永恒的生命。祂尝试透过祂的一生来证明永恒,从开始到终结,祂显示灵超越物质,没有什么能控制灵。祂为我们做的是很了不起的事情,就是为我们的灵创造很大的信心,毫无怀疑,祂已经证明了。我希望你们会明白,不会在一些细微锁碎的事情上令我费心,亦令自己费心,这些事情都不重要。你们要要求一些重要的,永恒的,有价值的东西。我很高兴你们喜欢这个地方,自得其乐,今天我们已经宣布很多配婚,在这短时间内发生了很多事情。

在圣诞节前夕,我祝福你们,希望你们有很快乐的圣诞和新年。

[Shri Mataji continues in Marathi for another 15 minutes]
[Translation from Marathi]

Today intentionally I have spoken in the English language. Since all Pune Sahaja Yogis know English, I do not have to explain further. On the Christmas day something has to be told to them about Christ. Therefore, I have spoken to them. Owing to our conditioning, we do not have much knowledge about of Christ, but it is not correct. It is no use following the past conditionings. These people have come from the Christianity religion but have learnt all about Divine incarnations that were born in this country and work they did here. In some respects, they are more knowledgeable than we are. So we should also learn about Christ, Mohammad, and other great Satgurus. The reason for you to have this knowledge is, when you become Gurus in the future and you are dedicated to the Brahma and you know what the Brahma is, this knowledge will enable you to talk to someone. Then you can clearly tell about each of them and correctly explain stories about them. Without you being knowledgeable about them, Sahaja Yoga cannot spread in the modern times. Sahaja Yoga’s advent is in modern times when all the people know about all. All people know about great personalities. Now that we are not in our individual ponds, but have come in the big ocean, all Sahaja Yogis should acquire information about all the peoples, about the people from all communities, about the people from all countries, about the people from all religions, and understand where they have gone wrong and where we have gone wrong. Only then can we become real Sahaja Yogis and Satgurus. A little study is necessary for that and I adivise you to do it sincerely.
My blessings to all.
We shall have today’s Puja with vocal music.
I have already told you that Radhaji, meaning Shri Mahalakshmi was Christ’s mother. Although She was Shri Mahalakshmi, She silently bore everything so that example that Christ was going to set up was absolutely without any flaw or shortcoming, which people would attribute to his mother. The way Mary, the form of Shri Mahalakshmi, bore everything, the way She sacrificed Her son, the way She witnessed Her son’s crucifixion, and the way She endured all these things. From Her example we should realize that we should give up our attachment to our children, like my son, my son and instead observe, “How much my son has progressed from the view point of Spirit, what he has gained in Spirit”.
All of us have become Sahaja Yogis and have gained a lot on coming in the Sahaja Yoga. So, now we should see, “What do we have which we can give to our children.” Only thing that we can give is the knowledge of Spirit. All should give that and all should receive it. I have purposely called you to this far away place, because I wanted you to see what hard work the people have to do for their living. You are troubled by small things. You are not ready to make even a little sacrifice. For everything you have to be cajoled to do this and that. With this nature, how will you become experts in Sahaja Yoga and how will you grow further? The people are not prepared for even a small sacrifice! This is not correct. I hear a lot about the Pune- Sahaja Yogis that they want everything for free and they never spare even a paisa. Unless you change your attitude how will other Puneits change? You are their examples; they will see and take you to be special people. And when they see you haggling for small amounts of money, they will think,” What is the use of practicing Sahaja Yoga? These people are also like us”!
Secondly, as I have repeatedly pointed out, feuds among brothers. It is a curse to us and I find it is there again. They quarrel over money. “Where has money gone? Why did they spend so much money? Why this, why that?” All disputes are over money. I am surprised. I am ready to do all for you but you want it free! One should have self- esteem. Shri Mataji has to spend on our food! It is not correct! Money can easily become available by saving small amounts through the year. These people spend money and I also spend, but it does not look good and is not in keeping with self-esteem.
If you go to any village, like I had been to Narayangaon on the other day, the people over there had cooked all food and kept it ready. They seated me and offered food. Nobody asked for money. Such was their hospitality. When guests come we have to keep our attention at them. I am astonished; even now Sahaja Yogis appear to be under the curse of quarrels amongst them. The people quarrel over small issues. This has happened about this and that has happened about that!
Suppose a leader is told that he is not thenceforth leader and another Sahaja Yogi is leader their feud starts. If a Sahaja Yogi is told that he has no vibrations and hence he should stop going to the collective he starts squabbles. In everything they are cantankerous. They fight in marriages. The people think that when there are quarrels at auspicious place like a marriage, there is nothing bad in quarreling. However, it is very bad. It is very bad in the eyes of God and it should not be done. Christ has used the words,” Murmuring souls” for such persons. They indulge in backbiting; speak against this person, that person in their absence. They also play one against the other. They are extremely mean. I call the city of Pune as the Punyapattanam. I say that all the Punya has been brought to this city and praise it and despite that this situation persists.
Next year all Sahaja Yogis should make vigorous efforts. Children of this place are wise. They collected money in which all have contributed. Then they gave the amount to me. I was so overjoyed to see them. How sweet they are! They are your children. Then what happens to the elders? Why do they behave the way they do? Let your hearts open a little bit in Sahaja Yoga! You have no burden of Sahaja Yoga. I do not take anything from you and do not want anything from you. On the other hand I have given you so much materially! Even if you see the material gifts that I have given you it is quite a lot. In spite of it, when I have to hear about such things, it makes me sad. So, please do not crucifix your Spirit again. Think that today is the day of your second birth and resolve to live with your hearts open and with your self- respect. Please remember that you have to keep your self-esteem.
Today’s auspicious day I have to tell this again since I cannot say when you and I shall meet again. So please take care in this respect. You should not behave this way, otherwise all will go down. On this day all should make vow that since Christ sacrificed his life and we have taken him as our elder brother, what we should do to be befitting to this relationship, how we should work it out. We have received so much in Sahaja Yoga. So what should we do in Sahaja Yoga?
I do not ask for money from you. But what shall I do if you do not want to pay for your own food and transport? On top of it you pick up quarrels. The next time it should not happen. The people told me that when they asked for money to foot the bills of your food and transport nobody came forward. If you are so poor that you cannot pay even Rs 40-45, you should not continue in Sahaja Yoga, since you will be a burden on us. We have not taken a contract to take care of beggars! If they are in such poor circumstances, they should not continue in Sahaja Yoga at all. Those who cannot afford even this much and want to have free food, we are not distributing free food! If these things are not corrected in time they are never stopped and keep comtinuing. Even your leaders are fed up and do not want it. That has brought the deficit. However, those people think that the leaders harass them and do not allow them to meet Shri Mataji. All these things should be dispensed with. “We are now united. So far we have not done anything for Sahaja Yoga.”I remember, during Gandhiji’s time, my mother gave away her bangles, bracelets, and whatever was available in the house. And today people cannot pay a few rupees! Is there so much financial distress? No , ther is not!
These people come here from faraway places. You also have assembled in the equal number. But you are not sharing the expenditure. Does it become of you? Pease tell all the Pune Sahaja Yogis that Shri Mataji has told every Pune Sahaja Yogi to do anything but come for the program. The people go to the Himalayas to have a glimpse of God. This is not the Himalayas and you did not have to walk so much as the people over there had to walk. All arrangements are in place. Yet the number who attended the Puja over there has not come here. The people here will come only if the program is in Pune and will not attend if held outside. The people who behave this way shall never improve their financial position. Now you should come to Ganapati Pule with appropriate preparations. A good number of you should come. It is not very expensive. I have made all the calculations. Contribution is essential minimum to meet the food requirements. It is just that and not more! You have to pay only once a year. You are not in such bad shape and can collect a small amount by saving a few rupees every month. If somebody is in such poor state we can bear his expenditure. However, if everybody takes this position nobody will go. This question never arises in villages. It is quite different there. It is only on moving to cities, starts, “ We want everything. We must watch movies every day. We must have bangles, we must have bracelets, and we must have armlets. Does not matter if we do not go to pay obeisance to God, or do not attend a Puja, but we must have all these.” Our attention is more with food, which we must have in plenty and of our choice too. Our attention is never on God. Find out why we do not progress. Today everybody should decide that we will save some money instead of squandering it away. These people have given up all, given up their habits and vices. So they have now plenty of money. Similarly, you all should shake off the slavery which you have accepted all these years and get fully deep in the kingdom of God.
I am sorry to tell you this today. But all the history comes back to me and I feel that if not corrected it will go on and on, Hence it has to be put end to. These things have to be stopped. Moreover, quarrels amongst you should completely finish. One against the other and the other against some other should never happen. All should unite and intermingle. Look at these people, who have come from fourteen countries have mingled and are staying together. Whereas here the people who have come; not from one country, not from one state, but from one city, cannot come together! It seems, we were born with battens in hands and we started fighting soon after the births! It is so bad in Pune. Of course, there are many beautiful things in Pune. A number of Sahaja Yogis, especially the young ones, are very beautiful. The girls are also very sweet. I appreciate them a lot. All are so loving! However, the old ones need to work little harder on themselves. So today, all should make a vow that we are Sahaja Yogis. We have joined the path of Sahaja Yoga and shall do whatever is necessary to progress on it. Should make a vow and God shall help all.
May God bless you.
