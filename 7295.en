Speech at arrival in Boryspil airport, Kiev (Ukraine). 17. September 1994.

I don’t know how to thank you all for such a welcome you have organized for Me.
Actually on Moscow’s airport they were little non-cooperative, and I was worried because they said, “You can’t go to Kiev”. All of your prayers have worked and I am here with you. There are so many who have come with Me, and everybody is so anxious to meet you here. They have had a big conference of the scientists. There were 2,000 scientists and about 10,000 people, and they were convinced that morality is very important for medicine. Without morality people cannot keep good health. They contaminate diseases. And I was surprised, this is only possible in your country – either Russia or Kiev – where people have such enlightened mind. No one can think of such a thing in other countries. You people are very advanced in your wisdom.
Also you are very deep in understanding spirituality – how important it is. I don’t know when will I learn Russian, it’s quite a difficult language. If I had come in My young age I would have learnt it, but I didn’t come that time. And I find that even if I don’t understand the language – I understand your heart. Some Indians had come and they said, “These people have a very, very large heart. We cannot be compared with them.” Even the English, the Germans, Austrians – all of them feel that about you.

So, now we have a Diwali Puja in Istanbul, and it is specially I have arranged there so that it’s easy for you to come there. We are going to have marriages there. So, I would like to have the forms filled by you. So, I hope to see you in Istanbul, which is not so difficult to go from here.

So, may GOD bless you all, may GOD bless You.
