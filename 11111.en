MAN in his search of joy and happiness is running away from his Self, which is the real source of joy. He finds himself very ugly and boring because he is absolutely unknown to his Self. Human being seeks joy in money or possessions, in power or human limited love and ultimately in religion that is also outside. The problem is how to turn one's attention inward.

The inner being which is our awareness is an energy (I call it energy of Divine Love). All the evolution and manifestation of material energy is guided by the Supreme energy of Divine Love. We do not know how powerful and thoughtful this unknown energy is. The silent working of awareness is so automatic, minute, dynamic and expansi ve that we take it for granted. At first it appears as silent throbbing vibrations through our being after self-realisation. Because we cannot fix our att&amp;ntion on to something that has no form (abstract being), our attention is wandering outside on forms. Now a method has been found out to tap the Divine power and this is called as ''Sahaja Yoga".

At the very outset, I have to say that the working of ''Sahaja Yoga" is very simple, altho.ugh the operation within is quite complicated. For example if you want to watch television it is very easy. But to explain the engineering technique of a television set is very difficult and complicated. lt also needs a qualified engineer to understand and explain its working ." I will try to explain it in the simplest way but please note that it is really complicated if you want to know it in detail. The best way to enjoy television is first to switch on and watch and then to understand its engineering. As a mother I would say that I have done the cooking for you. Why should you worry as to how it is done . If you are hungry you should start eating. If you are not actually hungry but only inquisitive what can I do? I cannot force you nor can I make you hungry by discussions or lecturing. I leave it to your wisdom and to your freedom to feel the longing from inside.

The word 'Sahaja' (Saha + Ja) means born with you (inborn). Whatever is inborn would manifest without any effort. Hence "Sahaja Yoga" Is the name given to my system, which is effortl ess, easy and spontaneous. lt is natural to Nature (you may call it life's source, vitality of Divine). To understand life let us take a case of something that is living -- a germinating seed .The seed grows by itself into a tree, blooms into flowers and the flowers get transformed into fruits. Any human effort cannot change the process of growth of a seed into a tree. The gardner can only look after the growth of the tree. In the same way the process of growth of our conciousness to further the evolution takes ·place effo rtlessly.

When the foetus (child in the womb) is about 2/3 months old in mother's womb, the column of rays of consciousness emitted through the all·pervading Divine Love, pass through the brain to enlighten it. The shape of the human brain being prism-like, the column of rays falling on it gets refracted into four diverse channels corresponding to the four aspects of the nervous system.
They are
1. Parasympathetic nervous system
2. Sympathetic nervous system (right)
3. Sympathetic nervous system (left)
4. Central nervous System (This need not be discussed as it is the link with objectivity).

1. The set of rays that fall on the fontanale bone (apex of the head known as Taloo) pierce in the centre and pass straight into medulla oblongata through a channel (Sushumna). This energy after leaving a very thread like thin line in the medulla oblongata settles down in 3.5 coils in the triangular bone placed at the end of the spinal cord (Moolandhar). This is known as 'Kundalini'.

The subtle energy enters through the centre of the brain (sahasrar Brahmarandhra) and precipitates on its way in 6 more centres. The gross manifestation of this subtle energy in the ''Sushumna'' .channel of the spinal cord is termed as Parasympathetic nervous system and ' 'chakras'' are· expressed as plexuses outside the spinal cord. Surprisingly we have the same number of plexuses and subplexuses outside as the number of "chakras" and their petals inside the spinal cord. Very little is known about this .system to the medical science. It is termed as the autonomous nervous system- the system which works spontaneously on its own. For example if we want to increase the rate of our heartbeat we can do it so by exerting the heart (activity of the sympathetic nervous system) but we cannot reduce the rate of the heart (activity of the parasympathetic nervous system). The parasympathetic nervous system is a system which is like a petrol pump through which the petrol of Divine Love is filled in us. But as soon as a human child is born and the navel cord is broken a gap is created in the '•sushumna" (the subtle channEl in the spinal cord} , and also outside, one can see'the gap between the solar plexus and vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. This gap is known as void in the Zen system of religion and Maya (or Bhav Sagar) in the Indian thought. Later when ego and super ego bloat up like balloons and cover our brain at the apex of the left and right sympathetic nervous system, the fontanale bone gets calcified and the all-pervading vital force of the Divine Love gets cut off completely.

Then the human being identifies himself as a separate entity and the consciousness of I (Aham)presides. This is the reason why man does not know his universal unconscious.'' He is served therefrom by his ego (I). The sympathetic nervous system is created to use this vital energy. There are two systems i.e. left and right. These two channels which carry this energy in subtle form in the medulla oblongata and are known as lda and Pingala respectively. The left side system (in the right handed man) caters to the emergencies of. the active consciousness (extra. efforts and emergencies) and the .right side system -- (medically they say it remains dormant)-- caters to the subconscious mind of the psyche (libido). Hatha Yoga comes from words Ha and Tha, meaning the Sun and Moon. Both these sympathetic nerve systems are called as the Sun and Moon channels (i.e. Surya Nadi apd Chandra Nadi). By this yoga, you can control the activity of the sympathetic i.e. you can use more energy that is stored or else completely stop the activity of the sympathetic for a short time.

By using the stored energy you cannot achieve eternal flow of the divine. With control over the sympathetic you can slow heart rate or even stop heart for a short time and may achieve all physical gross symptoms of para sympathetic but you cannot activate the parasympathetic which is the ch an nel for your real yoga (meeting of the divine). With Hatha yoga you may even control your mind. But the mind thus governed is heavily conditioned for the spiritual fight into the divine. One may keep good health and good mind to be a · good citizen in a society but that is not the only aim of life. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic act on the plexuses' but in opposition to each other i.e the parasympathetic relaxes the plexuses but the sympathetic squeezes the energy by constricting them . One fills in the vitality and the other consumes it. There is a gap in the parasympathetic nervous system (Sushumna) but no gap in the sympathetic nervous system at the navel po'int. This is the hurdle that has rendered all our search and -entry into the parasympathetic fruitless so far. lt is like three ladders, two of them touching the ground while the central one is hanging in the air. So whenever we try to rise in our consciousness, we move on to the sympathetic system . If we pass towards the left side we enter into the activity which goes on bloating in the balloon of ego. Thus we feal responsible and active. When th is activity increases beyond limits, like a growing tree whose roots are not equally grown, the being falls to the ground. Over activity of sympathetic nervous systems causes tensions, sleeplessness and ultimately all deadly diseases like cancer which are caused by the constricted plexuses which are drained out of their energy.

If you make parasympathetic dominate left side, then we can ant idote the effects of over activity and all the diseases and the effect caused by this side get cured automatically. The right side sympathetic nervous system (libido) has the power to store all that is dead in us. lt connects you w ith store houses of the sub-conscious mind and also with the collective sub-conscious (Bhootlok or Parlok}. At the backside of the brain at the apex of this channel the super ego exists like a balloon. lt becomes heavy by sto r ing, the conditioning of the mind through libido. So if the tension is heavy it breaks the super ego into many fragments. If you still over exert by conditioning a partial vaccum is created and this sucks ano t her dead persona li t y from the collective sub-concious (Paralok) in your super ego . So in your pursuit of truth if you take to further effo rts and indulge in concentration in training of mind or forced abstinence or forced med itation or complete slavery to emotional attachment of the mind, the libido with the aid of the affected super ego may connect you to the collective subconscious (Paralok) where all dead souls, bad, good or saintly, exist. These souls start manifesting through you and you get siddhis or extra sensory perceptions. Actually these are the different subtle (dead) personalities dominating us through super ego. · There is another method which may be effortlessly employed by many so called teachers by which they turn the "chakra" in · the direction of the libido and this can put you into your sub-con scious. This method either . makes this aspirant go into a trance or accept the complete domination of the dead spirits introduced by the teacher through the plexuses. In the first case. the Sadhka feels relaxed, his mind is switched off, but after a few years of practice, he realises his weak ness that he cannot face reality and he takes to heavy drugging. In the second case, t he aspirant becomes a complete slave of the teacher and starts giving away all the material possesions to the teacher without understanding the logic behind it. These teachers never explain the technique they have employed nor do they give their powers to anybody else. In short all efforts that you put in the name of religion or mishandling of Kundalini by so caflechealised people, can only activate sympathetic nervous system (lda and Pingla) that cannot make any progress to bring about the play of parasym pathetic (Sushumna).

All mesmeric powers such as materialisation power (enslaving masses for money power or fame), visionary powers (Drishti siddha), speech powers (Vani Siddha), curing powers, transcendental feeling (power of switching off the mind) , separation of body and many other powers are very ordinarily found among those who practice the control of spirits (Pretsiddhi or Smashan Vidya) . All such powers can be proved as powers of the dead in any one of our experimental Centres. These are no Divine powers because the Divine has no interest in these gross subjects. lt is only interested in the miracle of the ·inner being and its further manifestation to bring · about human evolution. Thus those who indulge and use their attention (i.e. chitta) on such ' ' siddhis" and those who run after such gross miracles find it difficult to follow '·Sahaja Yoga". We have noted that when such people confront "Sahaja Yoga", they start trembling and shaking like lt,!natics who also behave in the same way . If with very great di fficulty such a person reaches the state of self-realization, he completely loses all interest in such powers and in their exhibition. Actually then he is freed of all extra dead personalities who dominated him. There is no need to pass through the subconscious strata to jump unconscious. The subconscious is an end by itself and one gets lost who enters into its realms. These stratas are placed vertically and the only direct way is through parasympathetic through Sushumna, the central path which takes you to the Divine, the universal unconscious through "Sahaja Yoga" . lt is very dangerous to use the powers of the subconscious which may become uncontrollable and torture the practitioner and Sadhaka. Those who are temporarily benefitted may suffer irreparable loss to body, mind or grace. All religions have promised inner silence when · you reach the state of self-realization, the inner miracle of the subtle awareness and not gross jugglery. The Gita says that you become the witness (Sakshi Swarup) of the play of Divine. Many modern thinkers are also talking about the new awareness.

This has also been described as 'thoughtless-awareness' which results in collective consciousness . We hear of many prophesies made by ancient and modern writers about the evolution of a new race of super human beings of unique awareness. These are no more empty words. Through the discovery of "Sahaja Yoga" it is possible to achieve the transformation of the human consciousness to higher planes .promised by the various seers. · The subject of Kundalini i s no more a book knowledge. You can see with naked eyes the breathing of the Kundalini at the Mooladhar and also can feel the different "chakras" existing in the spinal cord with your fingers. Formerly. bridging the gap in the '' sushumna" was the insurmountable problem but it is .being discovered that if this gap could be filled with the vibrating power of Divine Love, the Kundalini rises like a majestic mother and breaks the apex of the brain (Brahmarandhra) without giving the slightest trouble to child (Sadhaka). lt happens in a split second in the short-spell between two successive thoughts. Of course, if the aspirant (Sadhaka) is diseased or his ''chakras" are constricted by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, the Kundalini being the mother of every individual and embodiment of love, knowledge and beauty knows how to reveal her love beautifully and to give rebirth to her child without causing any hurt. There are many descriptions about Kundalini warning us against the dangers and perils of the ''taming" of Kundalini. Also many books describe various gross or frightful experiences of the Kundalini awakening. Actually this is caused ·because Kundalini cannot rise without the "Sahaja Yoga" i.e. if it is tried to be awakened by someone who is not self-realized, the Kundalini doea not leave her seat or else without the proper invitation the Kundalini becomes adamant and angry. Thus the sympathetic gets into activity. When she is accused of sex, she sends heat waves over the sympathetic nervous system which causes the constriction or blockage of the plexuses and the path of the Kundalini is completely broken down. Sometimes one gets into funny gesticulations or loses complete awareness of the outside. Moreover with mishandling of "chakras" and Kundalini due to the ignorance or greed of the teacher, the chances of realisation of the aspirant can become very poor and sometimes impossible.

The mind that is very much conditioned or the mind which is the slave of self-indulgence or of egoistic actions and thoughts is also a very slow conveyance for "Sahaja Yoga''. Even if you read too much about the deconditioning of the mind, you may get only conditioned; if you try to decondition by efforts, you can become conditioned much worse than what you were . Deconditioning is only possible through Divine Love. The main condition of the "Sahaja Yoga" is that your will and freedom are all the time respected . In "Sahaja Yoga" the person is fully aware and alert and receives inner silence and experience without doing any unnatural movements. He sits in a completeiy easy pose throughout or he may also lie down (Sahajasana or Shavasana). The breathing is normal or less than normal. Religions are also the expressions and experiments of the realised souls, the seers. They also talk about the inner being, second birth and about self-realization. In the beginn fng, in India, they tried to take the attention inside by introducing symbols that they saw of this unconscious universal being within. This gave rise to pantheism and aspirant's attention got stuck to the symbols (Sakar) and to rituals which killed the main objective. So the other type of experiments of talking only about the abstract (Nirakar) gave rise to many other religions which ended up as dogmas or isms. The reason is obvious that talking about the flower or the honey cannot take you to the honey but can only create dogmatic isms in the mind. You have to be a bee to reach there i.e. you have to be reborn. This has to happen within, to take you inside. lt is too great an achievement and unbelievable but I feel the search of ages has brought great resuIts.

The mind, with a child-like innocence achieves very quick results. Whatever may be the loads of the mind, if the longing is honeat and earnest, sooner or later, the aspirant can get self-realisation. After reaching this state, the vibrat ion st art emitting from the extermities. They are described by Adi Shankaracharya in his work Ananda Lahari. These vibrations are the waves of Divine Love which can fill also other person's inner being and give him same experience of self-realisation. This is how the chain reaction starts. One light enlightens another. The physical manifestations are as follows: The pupils of the eyes get dilated. (Parasympathetic action); The face becomes radiant; the body becomes light; The tension is completely removed; Rising of the Kundalini can be seen by others and felt by the aspirant; First the throbbing is clearly felt at Sahasrar (apex of the brain) and when it stops, the complete silence is felt within and in all awareness; The flow of the grace is felt coming down, cooling the whole being. As the attention moves to the subtle, the gross attachments drop out. A person gradually loses identification with falsehood and artificiality. In the matter he sees beauty and not its possession value; In the knowledge he identifies himself the truth and he is not afraid to profess, nor does he indulge in the double standards of life; His flow of love becomes spontaneous; generous, without any tingle of attachment, possession or any return and, the person becomes ageless, a hollow personality. Now let us see what happes inside. The attention of the consciousness moves to inner being (Kundalini) . As the thread (sootra) of a necklace is passing through every bead of the necklace, the inner consciousness (Kundalini) is also passing through every human being. · As soon as our attention moves to our inner consciousness we can move on to the everybody's Kundalini.

One starts feeling the Kundalini, its nature, its position in other persons. Collective consciousness is ·thus established. Now you become a universal being. After some days you cannot say who is the other person? The power of love is so great and dynamic that with the movement of your fingers you can move the Kundalini of thousands. lt becomes child 's play. This is how the en-masse evolution of human beings will take place. These are the signs of advent of Golden Age of Truth (Satya Yuga) . Let us for get whatever hardships we have suffered in our search in the past. lt does not matter if some could not find it before this. You have to open your mind and understand that though the discovery is unprecedented it does not make any seeker or predecessor small. If some experiments are made it does not matter if ultimately we have found out the way. lt is a collective achievement. Perhaps in the choas of 'Kaliyuga it was to happen and mariy of us, who have been earnestly searching it in many lives, are reborn to have their promises fulfilled by the Divine. May be we were our predecessors.

On the tree of life there might have been very few flowers but now the blossom time has come. Their fragrance of longing has collectively materialized the manifestation of ·'Sahaja Yoga". Many are going to jump into the realm of thoughtless awareness where you get introduced to yourself and start identifying with your universal nature. Those who deserve will get the throne of their inner being which rules the skies of peace and the oceans of divine love and supreme knowledge within, which is limitless (Anant.)
