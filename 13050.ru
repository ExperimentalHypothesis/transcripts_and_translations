Yogini translates – Jai Shri Mataji repeated by many. Thank you very much. We love you very much (audience to Mother)

Shri Mataji: Of course, and you must all meditate, that’s very important.

Yogini translates

Shri Mataji: First time, the left hand, sitting on the ground with the right hand on the Mother Earth and a light, then on the chair, both the hands without any light. And maybe with the right hand, maybe hot

Yogini translates

Shri Mataji: Or ice maybe

Yogini translates

Shri Mataji: Now, when both the hands are alright, then you can put the water and the light. But when you are alright then only both the hands, the water and little salt with the light, five or ten minutes only, when you are alright, when both the hands are alright.

Yogini translates

Shri Mataji: Very simple, left to the right, whether it is left or right, and when it is both, try first the left then the right.

Yogini translates

Shri Mataji: That’s for psychosomatic, like cancer, diabetes

Yogini translates

Shri Mataji: Allergies, first left, clear out left. So, the virus you’ve got, so virus is finished

Yogini translates

Shri Mataji: And then the right side, because if you go too much on the right, suddenly with the shock, it’s like a pendulum, goes to the left, it’s psychosomatic.

Yogini translates

Shri Mataji: So, this is it, it is very simple, it is very simple, you judge yourself

Yogini translates & someone asks question on vaccination – using polio vaccine, it’s already with a virus etc

Shri Mataji: It’s alright, doesn’t matter, but this virus which goes in the body you see, excites your antibodies and they are ready to fight any other diseases. So, it makes you immune, immunity. It’s alright, doesn’t matter so much because that when you alright, when you are twelve years of age all the antibodies spread to the whole body through the sternum then it is of no use, like homeopathy, not so good, little bit, alright, not too much. ***

Shri Mataji: It challenges your immune system, in childhood, your immunity develops

Yogini translates

Shri Mataji: But not when you are grown up, it’s wrong, to take a polio vaccine is not going to clear

Yogini translates – other questions posed

Shri Mataji: For me to love you is the greatest joy
