“The Mahalakshmi Principle,” Shri Mahalakshmi Puja, Brisbane (Australia), February 20th, 1992

Something wrong. Who has made those with the things...You should put more of cotton in that, you see, slips back. Can you get it done by the...For pujas you must use Indian girls, [is] better. They know all these things better you see.

They said that, “Nobody asked us.” So they just sit on the fence (laughing).

They would think that, “We should not come forward, because they’ll think these people are talking too much, these Indians,” So, I mean, when they have to come they should come.

You can see, yesterday’s film, that we have a tradition, you see, we know all these things, isn’t it? This has been there in that country, so they should tell you, and you should not mind that. They also have the same fear as you have that they will say, “You have an ego”. I don’t know how to go about with anything

It’s quite warm.

It’s alright. I’ll teach you how to make this, alright? May God bless you.

Today I was thinking that we’ll do the puja to Mahalakshmi, will be better. So that we'll understand what Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is.

As you know, the Mahalakshmi Principle lies within all of you, in the centre. And once you are fed up with the falsehood, and also with the hypocrisy of people, you start seeking the truth within. That's how a new category of people are born, who are called as seekers — sadhakas. They are very different from others. They don't care for any material gain or any power, position; they want to seek the truth. And this category is the one you are, and that’s why you have come to Sahaja Yoga. This comes from your past lives also.

For many people, I think, it’s their past life which has brought this seeking in them. Also the affluence, through which you have gone. You got fed up with it, and you are seeking the truth.

Also, there are people, like in India, where the tradition is to seek the truth, from very childhood you are told that money is not everything, power is not everything, it’s all falsehood, you must seek the truth. So, you are ingrained with it. These are called as good conditionings — susanskara.

Now, if it is just a fashion, sort of a thing, that you get into fashion, that, “Let us seek the truth. Because everybody is talking about truth, let us have this as a fashion. Because everybody is doing it,” then it can be very dangerous. Such people get lost.

I have seen people who were drug addicts, who came to us first in England, and I was surprised that they were really seekers. And they were not taking drugs because of fashion. They were just taking it because they thought, by taking drugs, they will get into their Mahalakshmi Principle. Very intelligent, educated, very smart people became hippies and they started taking drugs. And I discovered that their seeking was only that they should find the truth. But they had no idea as to what is the truth is.

So, this Mahalakshmi Principle was born within them, sort of started manifesting, that: beyond all this, there must be something.

This category of people are everywhere in the world. Especially, I was surprised, in Russia, where there is no talk of God, there is no talk of religion. They are even better than Indians in understanding Sahaja Yoga.

So the conditionings of every country has also hampered the progress of Sahaja Yoga within you and outside.

So now, first of all, to understand Mahalakshmi Principle we must know that we have two other channels into which we can jump. One is the Left, another is the Right. And it depends on what sort of a background you had in this life. Because of your background in last life, you have come to the right path. But [the] last life has been covered by this life: the surroundings, the country in which you are born, your friends, parents, the society in which you lived, has dominated you in so many ways that the Mahalakshmi Principle doesn't express itself in that full power which should really suck in everything else and put you onto the throne of a Sahaja Yogi.

So you find people: yesterday there were so many people for example, very nice people, they were all seekers of many lives who came there. But we do not know how many will come to Sahaj Yoga and how many will settle down in Sahaj Yoga, [and] how many will achieve doubtless awareness. Again, the same problem is that they start getting into the habits formed by the Left Side or into the ego formed by the Right Side.

Now for a Sahaja Yogi, to keep his Mahalakshmi Principle all right, has to always introspect. Not to look at others but to introspect: “What am I doing? Am I in the Left Side or on the Right Side? Which side I am going [to]? What side I am following? Am I in the centre?” Now how will you judge? The best is to feel your vibrations: feel your vibrations. But sometimes you go so far to the Left or to the Right, that you just do not feel vibrations, [and] your Mahalakshmi Principle is not working. Then you go on. It’s like a complete derailment, I should say. A kind of a slope on which you just go on falling on to that.

So all these conditionings we should watch out; in ourselves and in others: how we have got these problems that we slip out from the central path.

Imagine a train is going on a proper railway track and suddenly it starts moving this way or that way. So, where will it end up? Into destruction only!

But you have a way of arranging that this derailment can be brought back to the middle path. So in a very detached way, if you look at yourself like a witness and see for yourself — not about others. Even when I give lectures people start saying, “Oh Mother is saying about somebody else!” No, I am saying about you, yourself!

So you watch out that: are you in the centre or are you going to the left or to the right.

First of all: those who are in the centre should not have any physical problems; should be able to completely cure themselves. If not others, they should be able to cure themselves.

Secondly: a person who is in the centre is a very peaceful person. He’s never angry. He might put up a show that you are angry, but he doesn’t get involved into anger or any emotions whatsoever. He just watches and he can act, he can act, to be in that feeling of temper also lust, greed, anything. But just to act, because sometimes this acting is needed so he can use it. But you should be sure, first of all, that you are completely detached.

So first of all, before acting, you must become a master of acting. And for that you have to become your Self. If you become your Self then you are a master and you can see where are you going.

Now the difference between a Sahaj Yogi and a Sahaj Yogi who is like this, as you say, is this: that he is capable of going to the left or to the right. They are not solidly Sahaja Yogis! And they go on like this, and there is no progress. Imagine any airplane which is wobbling like that, will be on the ground only. Nobody will be able to put it up in the air, because God knows when will it fall down.

So for any machinery, we have to fix it up properly first, before we start working it out. So to fix up our Mahalakshmi Principle, you have to see that your physical being is all right, is normal, no problem. I am not meaning the modern ways of looking at health, but that you should feel healthy and happy. You should feel that there is no problem with your physical being. But if you are a complaining type, “Oh I am here paining!” “I am paining there!” Then there is something wrong with you. This is the first criteria that you are in the centre.

Then your attention should be more towards nature: how the nature is, how it is blossoming, how it is working out. It should be towards the sky, stars and things. Just to enjoy all the creation that is around you; just to enjoy it. That’s an enjoyment which is really so surprisingly deep: when you see something, beautiful scene or something, you go to a very beautiful place, then a kind of a joy that pours in you from your Sahasrara. That also, you must experience.

Also you must experience your thoughtless awareness. That is, when you look at something beautiful, you should suddenly become thoughtless and just start seeing it. The whole joy will start pouring on you.

Then another thing is that you should not differentiate between religions. You should not condemn any religion. But the people who are stupid and call themselves religious, they can be condemned, because they are stupid! They have not followed the principle of religion at all. They are not realised-souls and that’s what they are making a mistake. So that's all right. For example churches can be condemned, but not Christ, not the Bible: not at all, never. So, when you see to the roots, the roots are all right. But now, as I said, these flowers have been plucked by people and they are fighting.

So you should never condemn any incarnation, any religion, any prophet. I mean you will not condemn. It is not a question of I am saying, “You don't do it!”, you will just not do it. You will respect all of them, automatically, because now you are born into it. If you, say, are a Christian, you will respect Hindu scriptures. If you are a Hindu you will respect an Islamic Quran. That has to be there. If it is not so, then please know that you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

There should be no malice about any religion whatsoever. No religion has done any wrong so far. It's the people who follow them in a wrong way, use it for money, use it for power and also are stupid. For them it’s different. But for you, every religion is your own religion. So we cannot be fundamentalist. We cannot fight for fundamentalism.

Vishwa Nirmala Dharma which is based on the Mahalakshmi Principle, is the essence of all the religions, the truth of all the religions. And we seek, with our pursuits, what are the common points in all these religions. We try to neutralise [those] which are not common points and find out with our research pursuits, that this one was not the correct thing but is not in the religion: [just] people are following like that.

There are so many things you can find out. If in the Bible, if you remove Paul, you will cleanse most of it. If Paul is not there, I tell you, most of the Christianity can be cleansed out, because he started confessions, he started all this nonsense, he started making people feel guilty and treating women as nothing: all Mr. Paul has done it. And he had no right to be there in the Bible because he never knew Christ. He was an epileptic. And he saw some cross. I don't know how far it is truth. But he said he saw a cross. So what? Seeing the cross doesn't mean you become the cross!

Also he wanted to jump on the platform. A nice platform is made for you; and he has powers, and he wants to have powers, so, he jumps on the platform. Then he organises Christianity: all his mistake. Never in the Bible it’s said, never Christ said, that you should organise Christianity, nor has He said that you should confess or you should feel guilty. All the time He has been talking of forgiveness. In that short time also, He has given the truth to us. But I mean, if somebody wants to interpret, then it goes wrong.

So another point of a Sahaja Yogi is: whatever I say they don't have to interpret. They know it, exactly, what I say. If they start interpreting, then there is something wrong with them: their brains are not all right, they are not normal. You cannot interpret me. Whatever I say, I say in a very simple English language. I do not use Shakespearean language or something like that. I modulated my Standard of English up to the normal common people’s language. And if you start interpreting it, that means something [is] definitely very, very wrong with you.

There’s nothing to interpret. I am saying a straightforward thing which need not be interpreted. This is a very important thing. But many Sahaja Yogi's who are half-baked, I should say, start interpreting me, because they think they have brains to interpret me!

You have no brains of that calibre that you can interpret me. There are no interpretations. Whatever I have said, I have said it, and there is no need to interpret. This is one of the signs that you are not in the centre: either you have been possessed or you have become egoistical.

So to keep yourself in the centre, to be solidly Sahaja Yogis, first of all there should be no interpretations of what I say.

If you think that I am meaning something else, you can write to me. But don’t interpret and start a big organisation against Sahaja Yoga. This is the greatest mistake that people do.

I have told many people that you should not give lectures about Sahaja Yoga. Because once they start giving lectures, also sometimes they get into derailment. Either they get egoistical or they say things, as they say, out of their hats: which I have never said and which are not to be said. So unless and until you are a solid Sahaj Yogi, I think you should not talk about Sahaj Yoga.

Best is to give Realisation. Though you are half-baked, you can give Realisation: that’s one point for sure. And those who will get, will remain Sahaja Yogis. I have seen people who have given Realisation to others are gone cases, while those whom they have given are perfect!

Now when somebody gives you the Realisation, he is not your guru by any chance. He is not your guru and have no sort of an awe or an obligation towards that person who has given you Realisation. If you do that way, then the ego of that man wouldn't go away, and you will have conditioning. You will always stand by that person though he has done wrong. Though he is absolutely not a Sahaja Yogi, you will stand by that person. With him you also move to the direction in which he has moved.

So in Mahalakshmi Principle, one has to be careful, absolutely, to see where are we going.

Now the group system starts, also with the same. There is a big fraternity of  bhoots, I must tell you. If you go to the left, all the leftists will join you. If you go to the right, all the rightists will join you. Then they’ll fight among themselves and get out of it.

Now for Sahaj Yogis, who believe in fighting back, in grouping back, they should know, they have derailed. Maybe they were very intelligent, they thought they could do that, maybe. But none of them are above the Divine intelligence.

But when you start moving out of [the] Mahalakshmi thing, you become like a common person; even worse than a common person, I would say. So then you are grabbed by the negative forces which are around us. Just like all others are grabbed, you are also grabbed.

There are conditionings, which also we should: see do we have.

Say a Western person must see Western conditionings very clearly. What are these conditionings?

Because we are seekers of truth, we do not belong to any country. We belong to the universe: Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. We do not belong to Australia, we do not belong to Brisbane. You see, this belonging becomes so small and so mean that ultimately it will become, we belong to this street and then we belong to this room, and we belong to this bathroom. Start going down, down, down, so much! While is it Vishwa Nirmala Dharma [which] means it is a universal religion. We belong to the universe. We are part and parcel of the universe. Not only belonging to one place or one location. We cannot. Now we have gone into eternal life. We have gone to something that is unlimited. So we belong to this universe.

Once you realise that you belong to this universe, you should also know what conditionings are still sticking on to us from this country, from this culture, from this place, from this household, from this family. Like a little lotus that comes out of the mud: slowly, slowly it throws away all the mud that is sticking on to it. Ultimately it comes out as a very clean flower.

From the mud it gets to the water, cleanses itself and comes out as a beautiful flower, absolutely fragrant. And then it spreads its fragrance all round, so that that mud also gets fragrance. That’s your job, that’s what you have to be. Because you are not a seeker of truth for yourself but for the whole world, because you belong to Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

This Mahalakshmi Principle is not for you alone, but it is for the whole world, and you have to give it to the whole world.

So now we are here forming a new kind of a race, a new kind of a society, which is enlightened, which is standing on the truth and love. Of course, you must understand that there should be compassion.

(Child crying after an accident)

Look at that child! my God! That’s another condition of the children here: they must do something to get hurt. It’s very common. All the time, they do things that will hurt them. They cannot sit quiet. It’s very surprising. In India you find children will sit quiet for three hours, four hours, [for] as long as the pujas are.

Now here the children are, I don't know. But I am going to find out a solution for this. They just cannot keep quiet. And now in America, they are suffering from overactivity: it’s a disease. It’s a disease now. They don't know what to do with the overactive children. They are overactive.

But I think I'll be able to find out some solution for that. But as far as you are concerned: you are your own solution. You can watch yourself. You want to be people who are spiritually very well equipped. For that equipment you must see yourselves: where are you going? What are you doing? What’s your style of life?

A solid Sahaja Yogi or a yogini, everyone knows all over the world [that] they are solid [and] nothing can deter them. And you can also know about yourself. It’s not that you cannot know. All of you can know yourself very well because now you are quite sensitive and you have your own centres enlightened by Mahalakshmi Principle.

The Kundalini has definitely enlightened your Mahalakshmi Principle. So you can always make out, “What my chakras are?How are they catching? Where are they catching?” Instead of avoiding that, you just work it out: what’s the problem, where is the problem?

Once you work it out then you will be surprised that, as soon as your desire goes inward, the Kundalini Itself will rush through, and She will cleanse your chakras.

As I was telling you, we do not know our powers. Only one thing you have to do is to desire. You have to desire that: “Let my vibrations be all right. Let my chakras be cleared out. Let me be in the centre, in the balance.” Just you have to desire! I mean it’s such a simple thing to desire. But that also we cannot do.

Our desires are something else, not what we have to be. Just you have to desire that, “Let me be a clean Sahaja Yogi. Let me be a solid Sahaja Yogi.” There are mediocres who can never be. I am not talking about them. But so many can be very high up, can be very high up in Sahaja Yoga. But their desires are not yet being fully manifested. Then there is a damping effect of so many things I have told you about.

So, if supposing you have to catch the plane, then you don’t get down on the way somewhere and stay out. In the same way, when your Kundalini has to rise, you can see everything that’s happening, but keep yourself aloof, because you have to reach your point. And that is through this Mahalakshmi Principle.

It is a principle that is so detached. It is the nourishing principle within us, which nourishes our centres, which nourishes our characters, which nourishes our religion, that is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. It nourishes everything. It nourishes our brain, our intellect. Everything, it nourishes, this Mahalakshmi Principle. Above all it is the balance in you. It balances you.

If you are overdoing something, then it gives you a kind of a push. If you are not doing anything, again it works in such a manner that it balances you.

So this is the guiding factor for you, this Mahalakshmi Principle, which works out everything that is balancing you, the equilibrium and the wisdom. As the light of Mahalakshmi Principle starts, the wisdom dawns upon you.

But the greatest of all is the love: love for God, love for truth. And you thrive on that love. Just you are there. I mean, I asked him, “Why so many are here?” They said, “For the puja!” Why? It’s a sign that you are great Sahaja Yogis, that you are here because of puja, that you understand the value of puja and that you need the puja, that you enjoy because it is nourishing to you. It’s a very good thing, because that shows that you are very much there, you are very much understanding the importance of right things, and you want to do it at any cost.

All these desires are significant because they show that you are in the Mahalakshmi Principle and you want to keep on that one.

I would say, there is a simple one that you can do is just to be on my Kundalini, if you can: just try to be in my Kundalini, on my Kundalini. Just put attention. You can, all of you can. Any problem, just put your attention onto my Kundalini, and you will be all right, you will just become thoughtless, because there’s no thought. This is the best way to do it, is to just solve all problems by putting attention on my Kundalini. And, by that your ego will definitely dissolve, because then you will know that, “Mother is doing everything. I am doing nothing. So why should I be proud of it?”

Also the conditionings will dissolve because my Kundalini is absolutely pure, it’s not attached to anyone. It is not even attached to Sahaj Yoga. It is not attached to anyone. The job it has got to do is to nourish everything. If it can nourish, well and good. If it does not nourish, well and good.

It depends on what do you want. You want to be nourished: all right, so the Kundalini is there, the Mahalakshmi Principle is there, it will nourish you. But if you don't want, nobody is going to force you in any way. Nobody is going to jump on you or form some sort of a formidable oppression: nothing of the kind. It's just like a River Ganges, you can say, which is flowing. Now if you want you can fill up your pitchers. If you don't want, She is not going to enter into your pitchers. She is not going to come in your house and get into your pitchers.

So there has to be a desire to get it, and that is what is called as bhakti. Bhakti is the desire, the devotion, to get the joy of bhakti. It's such a beautiful thing. I wish, I could do the bhakti to someone, but I can’t do. Because I see you, when you are in bhakti, you just get lost into it. So much you enjoy. It’s such an enjoyable thing. Then you don't think, you just enjoy the bhakti. And that’s what is the most coveted, the highest, state where you are just one with the Divine and just swimming in the ocean of joy.

So this Mahalakshmi Principle is to be preserved and has to be always watched and looked into. And the blessings of Mahalakshmi are so many that, I tell you, I cannot even tell them in one lecture; I'll have to give at least ten lectures. But you yourself know what are the blessings of this Mahalakshmi Principle is. The greatest is the complete self-contentedness: it’s absolutely self-contented.

You don’t want to grab something, you don’t want to run after something, you are just self-contended. You don't want any publicity, you don't want any comfort, nothing. You are comfortable in your Spirit. This is the greatest blessing of this Mahalakshmi Principle. And, if that is so, then why not we look after our Mahalakshmi Principle and forget about the rest.

Last of all, when it enters into your brain, then the Viraata is manifesting and you become collective, absolutely collective. It’s such a beautiful thing, is to be collective. There was a girl who went to Sicily and she was in a restaurant eating something alone. And then she looked at somebody else and that girl also looked at her. And this one got up and came to her and, they were not wearing badges; they said, “Have you been to Shri Mataji?” “Yes. Have you been?”  “Yes.” “We are Sahaja Yogis?” “Yes.” And then they just embraced each other with such joy. In a far-fetched place somewhere in Sicily, in some restaurant. Imagine! And they just got lost. The feeling of fondness, the brotherhood, the friendship is so great and so joyous. You don't then consider from what country you are, from where do you come, what is the colour of your skin, or what is the religion you had followed, what your parents are. You just enjoy meeting people. This friendship, this joy, comes from the same Mahalakshmi Principle when She enlightens your Sahasrara.

In the Sahasrara you get this feeling of the whole and the feeling of the whole is something so great. Individualism, people talk, but it is against the principle of whole. Who do not know the whole, talk of individualism. This individualism which has worked all kinds of dangers for us, now. We have to know that we are one with the whole. Of course, we are individuals in the sense that we have different, different faces, different clothes, different living, different relationships, but we belong to the whole. And this Viraata’s feeling that we are part and parcel of the whole gives you complete peace and complete protection. You never feel that something can happen to you, never. Some accident will take place, all right, will take place, but nothing will happen to me, I am a Sahaja Yogi.

So many people have gained like this, by allowing themselves to be completely looked after by this Mahalakshmi Principle. Just surrender to the Mahalakshmi Principle means that you give up your ego and you give up your conditionings. You give up both the things; just surrendering to your Mahalakshmi Principle.

That's why Mahalakshmi is so important.

May God bless you all.
