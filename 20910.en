Dinner with Ayatollah Rohani

Shri Mataji: About whats happening all around the world about Islamic people and they said that “Mother we will join you in every way because we will bring peace. I was very happy. So they said they have had lots of conferences and this and that organisations; nothing has worked out. And in Sudan most of them are Muslims. And educated people even in Senegal, I know, are very well educated people are there. And fundamentalism is not so much in Sudan, but the fight between the two sides of the Muslims; one on the Arabic side another on the African side. I said I will come to Sudan and let us see. In America we have lots of Iranians. I met them in Los Angeles. There are 900 families, Muslims. And they want there realisation. Very very beautiful.

[in between there is some one also translating/speaking in persian/Iranian/? Language other than French translation]

Person1: [may be translating to Shri Mataji] They said there is a Hadith in Arabic ?? The prophet. The Hadith which says the “Whoever knows himself Knows God”

SM : Who knows. Thats it. Thats the point. You see, as you know Mohammed sahab was the great person, great enlighted person. And he did say the same thing, I mean. How could he say something else.

So they, you see, they have not understood Mohammed sahab. ??. Worse them ?? They are the real murderers. Also there was a problem, this Paul who was, who never met Christ, who was Bureaucratic who had killed so many Christians. He thought its a very good platform, so he jumped on the platform. And he wanted to take over. And he fought with the disciples of Christ. And Thomas ran off to England. He has written in his treaty which we have now discovered ?? and is all nothing but Sahaja Yoga. And the worst disciple of Christ was Peter. And Christ has said that a Satan will take over him. He (Christ) has said it clearly. So this Mr. Paul caught hold of people and then he wrote that Christ said that Peter should be head of Christianity, he should build a church, ?? . Its all false. Now think of somebody who is such a bad disciple of Christ who denied Chirst thrice. Why will Christ make him the head ? And if you see this Paul in the, Paul throughout, he has written many chapters in the Bible. And he wrote that he went to Damascus and met Christ, he never met Christ. And in all that doesn’t write anything about spirituality. He writes how to organise, how to arrange people, all these things. Like a bureaucrat. And he suffered from epilepsy.

Now in Sahaja yoga we have proved that epilepsy comes with posessions. And he hated woman. So he called Christ’s mother as a woman. Just a woman, no even ??. But because of the Pagan religion before they wanted to have a Godess you see. So they said we will have a Madonna ??. in bible she is not there. Now thre is also Shariyat (Shariya). I must tell you about Shariyat (Shariya). So the bible has the 5 books, of the old testament, 5 ?? they call as. Out of that the 3rd one is ?? . They say ?? in english language but actually it is ?? in hebrew language. ?? is the name in hebrew, original. So he wrote in that when Moses came from the mountain and brought the 10 commandments, he saw a complete decadance. And he (Moses) got so upset with it that he (Moses) wrote this shariyat (shariya) for the Jews. At that time, only for that time. So it was not for Muslims. In Quran there is no Shariyat. I told you my father was a great research scholar and he wrote/translated the Quran-e-sherif in hindi language. He told me all these things, that it was not meant for Muslims. It was meant for the Jews. Also Fatima was absolutely sort of neglected by the people at that time. They wouldn’t listen to her what she has to say. Her ideas about women was very different. ?? Abu?? and the companist?? . They just wanted to put woman down. For sahaj yoga we worship Fatima. She is a Godess to us. But. My father has done lot of research on this and he said that Muslim are mislead completely by these mullahs and these priests, and specially sunnis. And the Shias are still sort or moaning the death of ?? . But now its over. Once you got your resurrection, once you got your realisation then there is no more, no more at all of moaning should be there. Its finished. Also this makes the souls of Mohammed sahab and also Hasrat Hussain very unhappy seeing that you are still moaning. They want you to be happy. They came on this earth to make you happy and joyous. No to be a ??. There work was-could not be finished. Now you can see the Qiyama has come and once you get your resurrection then you should no more feel the moaning. Its over now and we must give them peace in their heart. In India this Shias do such horrible things, what you call the chains, hit, and it ?? blood. I mean I have seen it and I talk to them - its over now. We have many friends who are Shias and I told them that its over now. You just dont have to do all these things because it hurts them (Mohammed,) their souls. And I said he is a loving father and a father doesnt want his children to suffer. 

SM to someone may be ayatollah: I got something for you sir, can I give you ? I am your mother. You get over the moaning. ?? . Instead of the black now you have to wear the white. ?? . And this is for the neck. Why dont to wear it now. Let me see how you look. A mother cant see her son moaning. ??. waow. Now mother is happy. And this for your ??. May God bless you. ?? .

This for you (someonelse). ??You see normally we never give empty purse. We never give empty purse so we have to put something in it. ?? .

In my language we call it attar an in urdu language ittar and your language is aattar. ?? French language is little bit top ??. Once you know English you cant know any other language. Its a very dominating language. ?? . Specially in the diplomatic circles now English has come up. Jews can be ?? now english. I dont know why it has happened like that. ??

person2: Then the very first letter sent by Muslims was by Ayatollah Rohani.The very first letter. And in this letter he asked them what they think about the Islam and what they would like to do to unify the different point of view of inside the catholic church. And he asked that Islam was also be considered in this council and be treated as unification of other branches of the Catholic church.

SM: of the catholic church with islam .. how?

(there is a translator speaking for Ayatollah may be, then Person2 translates to/for Shri Mataji in english/french respectively)

Person2: just what the vatican consider about Islam and also the way that Catholic church and Islam could be approached to work in a one single way. 22 years ago Shri Mataji . And all these documents are still there proving that is was 22 years ago. ??And during two years they were in permanent contact with this council. And after many years of deliberating about these they did consider that Mulsims are monotheist religion.

SM: ohh..

person2: And they accepted also that the Muslims believe in the resurrection.

SM: Aa.. the resurrection ?

Person2: the resurrection. The catholics approved, accepted that the Muslims believing in the resurrection as well. And the anti of this judgement of the catholic church was the muslims, the priests use to calamoni?? the muslims, to insult them. Until that ??. openly. And sending letter and speaking openly against the muslims. And then the judgements, the pope told to all the priests that Muslims were believing the day of resurrection, that they are monoethists, they forbiddened them (priests) to say things against Islam. So this was a very great victory of Ayatollah Rohani. And that time Pope ?? ask Ayatollah Rohani to go Vatican and speak with him, to meet with him.

SM: Which pope?

Person2: Pope Francis. And he went to Vatican and they spoke together about 45 minutes. And he (Pope) allowed also him (Ayatollah Rohani) to big speech to all the priests that were there. And officially he gave to Ayatollah Rohani the verdict that the Catholic church accepts that Muslims are mononethists, that they believe in the resurrection, and that any priests is (not) allowed to say anymore things against Islam. And then Pope asked him to transmit to all the Muslims and catholics. And then he gave him a ?? gold medal ??. When he came to Paris ?? International school and the whole world was speaking about this matter. To that point the whole media in France gave lunch in his honour. And mainly in the countries that needed good communication between Islamic and catholics. Then he wrote an article that in the ?? knowledge of Islam shwoing whatever is done in this matter for Muslim. And he (Ayatollah Rohani) prepared everything to offer to you Shri Mataji.

SM : Ohh is ??

person2: And one year before the revolution he found a association old monoethist. All those who believed in God. He formed an organisation. And so this movement was done at Tehran and it was done by Ayatollah Rohani and the Ambassador of Vatican at Tehran. It was really welcome at Tehran, this movement was really successful. The he will show you the photograph it was in the first page of news paper

SM: How many years back it happened?

Person2: About 14 years. 14-15 years ago Shri Mataji. One year before the revolution. So nobody else could promote this movement in Tehran accept/except because it came from very religious family, has been religious for 150years. So it was very much accepted. And he is saying all these things just to show you Dear Mother that this is the starting point of the work that he would like to do yourself. The world presently needs you and him and muslims.

SM: ya

person2: And he would like you to work the end on the end with him so that this population can live happily and get out of the opression. And when he knew that you are coming to Paris he immediately prepared this lecture to welcome you

SM: its very beautiful. But there is one thing you see that catholics have gone astray completely. You see because they are so money oriented. This vatican counterfeited 9 million dollars. Imagine, its a religious and distributed to its bank. Now thats one things. When the preists are such hypocrites that they have ?? as ?? children, they go to married women, is now all in the books. In Austria. And they were asked why dont you marry? So they said the Church does not want to mary to the widows. And also they are abusing, the high preists are abusing children in Canada. There is a book. In Italy. Christian Democratic Party was ruling for 40 years. Pope told people that you must vote for them, party, ??. And this party so corrupt and they killed so many people. In Italy I was shocked because this Calvi (Roberto Calvi) was killed was?? and the one who murdered him said that I am from mafia but the Pope paid. See that they are one with mafia and the Swiss banks. In that book it was written that this Luciani, the one who was before this pope, was murdered. The suspect that this pope (PJP II) has murdered. See how can this be God’s work. Tell me.

Person2: He says that according to you Shri Mataji we should separate the reality, those who pretend to be in the name of religion.

SM: Of course.

36.10

Person2: We has to be to be clear cut that there is a difference between the followers of the real religion who are ?? and they are looking really for the redemption ??

SM: They are so simple, innocent. ?? they don’t know what sort of people are there. But these horrible people are still there. They will be exposed. This year they will be exposed. They have crossed all the limits.

Person2: He doesn’t want to speak politics with you Shri Mataji. He would like your communication to the on the spiritual and human level that

SM: But the don’t like ??

Person2: He has politics life. Apart from that he would like to tell you something.

SM: What I am saying you are in politics life and you can talk to them on politics. But they have mixed up spirituality and politics. Specially catholics.

Person2: There is a judge world wide well known Khal Khalid. He did kill 27000 people. This judge after the revolution.

Lady: After the revolution this very famous lawyer, Iranian lawyer, he killed apparently 27000 Iranian

Person2: He ( may be lawyer) went to the Vatican with delegation of 3-4 people and he was received by the Pope. So he reacted very much against this. In all the media reacted against them. And so, he reacted so much that the official represent of the American radio to ask the Pope ‘why did you receive this man whose hands dirty with blood’. And even if he doesn’t agree at all with whatever is being held in Vatican, whatever else, wherever, his goal is much higher than that because he would like the respect of all the religions.

SM: But they cannot you see they are criminals. Vaticans are criminals. They got all these war criminals, protected them, took them to Argentina. These Vaticans.

Person2: That’s exactly the purpose what he is saying Shri Mataji. We have to divide and to share one side the ones who are taking the advantage of religions and on the other side ones who are following sincerely a religion.

SM: Yes very much. I’ll tel you. They are so simple, so simple. One man came to me and he had this problem here (some position on body may be), you see this comes from the Vatican from the Christian. I was born in Christian religion myself. So I know...

So you see he had this problem. So I asked him why do you feel guilty. (He said:)‘Because I am a sinner’. I said who told you that. So he says ‘I have to go and confess al the time that I am a sinner’. I said you are not. He says but I am a Catholic. So what am I to do?. I said you don’t confess. You don’t go to Church. He said I see this see these priests, they are very money oriented and they are not good people.

Simple man you know. And there intentions are not good. I see that. But they are human beings isn’t it. So I think that God is different and they are human beings. So innocent.

I said why do we confess to such people? I said God is not in the church. He is above. So you should not confess to a man who is not a good man. Then he was convinced. And then I gave him realisation. But he was so innocent, so simple. Educated.

Such craze they have I tell you.

They are exploiting their people.

Person2: Very interesting. He is saying that even when he sees that he is dealing with some people who are spiritual leaders that are not honest and that . He says that he feel obliged to go a little bit in their sense because he thinks about the millions of followers they have that have to be saved. And he says you can convince one, may be two human beings; but he says that there hundreads, and millions of people in this world that has to be convinced, what can we do?

SM: Realisation ! But I tell you there was a sufi in India. And very well known Khwaja Nizamuddin Sahib. And even Hindu ??(audio cut). They said it is a Nizammuddin’s feet. I said they are mine. So I went there inside. And as you say that gentleman who was supposed to be incharge of, was a great great hypocrite. First thing he said we need some money. Alright. I said how much? He said 10,000/- rupees. I wanted to go his way. I thought that you see this fellow, everybody thinks he is a big Nabib. I gave him 10,000/- rupees. Because so many were there, innocent, good people. And he also said that you can come in and this and that, but he was a hypocrite. Immideately took the money, put it. But can you imagine. When I came away, he died. It has happened with 3 like that. So there is also another force which works. This hipocracy will be exposed. Now you see, if these things happens that all the people who are faithfull, who believe in God, will receive the knowledge. And the time has come for this to be exposed. So, there is a tremendous force. But they wouldn’t like us, these people who are incharge of religion they wouldn’t like us. Becuase they are only money interested. They are not concerned about spirituality. So we have to do something in sucha a way that it is amass revolution. My father told me the same that you have come here for a purpose. I also knew that. So you don’t talk about religion, don’t say anything about it, till you have found out what you have come for.

50.29

Now my mission was, of course people used to get their realisation no doubt, there were people who were Nabibs also; but my mission was to create an amass realisation. So because of my mfather also, because of my husband I met many many people. And I could study also what was the problem inside, with the human beings. And when I discovered the permutations and combinations, as described in the Quran the 7 heaven was opened. That is how this amass business started. The 7th heaven had to open, otherwise it would not have happened??. So this is what is troubling these people who are hypocrites that now what will happen to them. They are quiet worried. Because its amass. Like in that hall when you were there, everyone raised there hands except for 2 or 3.

Person2: He is asking, if just before you were in London?

SM: Yes. London in the Albert hall. London is another taken by ??. London is, I can’t understand. The whole that hall, such a big hall, ??. I think the English are very [sort of alert]?? and they are following it up. They are trying to understand. Because in England there is lot of scholarship. Even Prince of Wales wanted to see me. But he had this problem of this woman

Person2: Mr. Maliky is very spiritual man who is very active as well.

SM: I saw yesterday his hands were as cool as ice.

Person2: He was teacher in the faculty of ??[oon/doan]. Teacher.

SM: But, see with all this happening now, yesterday we were there; there hands were cool. I was very happy. And you will find now the life will change completely.

Person2: He has lot of sympathy for you Shri Mataji.

SM: Now we have to work together. It automatically cures you of disease, automatically. Yesterday we had an architect there who had blood cancer, doctors said he will die within one weeks time. And now 8 years have passed, he is still there.

Person2: His son is a doctor, incharge of 25 patients of cancer in the hospital

SM: Oh my God. So I will tell him how to do it. Its the control of the parsympathetic. Its absolutely scientific and tangible.

Person2: Its much more complicate than that.

SM: No no no. I will tell you what, we have some doctors now in England, 7 doctors. One of them is a Muslim. Another Amjad is in Australia, now gone (to Australia). Very athletic. They are now trying to record how many people have been cured. So we deal with ?? sympathetic nervous system and parsympathetic nervous system. And there is on Dr. Rai, who is the head of the physiology department in Delhi University; he has written a book. Better give him this look. And let him have a look at it. And we are going to have conference of doctors, as he has been saying, because we never had in Europe so far. So that also I hope you will attend. Also there is a sypmosium of people who believed in the non-racialism and non-fundamentalism. Mostly muslims. First we decided that they wanted to have a big conferences. But I know this conferences are never result oriented. So, I told them that what we can do is to get people who are wanting to do something about it. Now, then give them realisation. So they go above mental level. And then, these people can form an organisation. There could be muslims, christians, any thing. Those who believe that fundamentalism and racialism the greated danger to humanity. And they can work it out. We have to move in a different way, not in the normal way of having conferences, organisations. Now there are so many organisations floating in the air. And I told my huband, and he was very happy that I have had enough of conference. So he wants realised souls to be incharge of even UN; my husband says that. That is his idea. And he said that by this because the people will be of a higher awareness, it will be result oriented. And so we have to do something about it and we are thinking of doing it in September and I have very humbly request you to come to my humble place. It is in a small place called Cabella, Italy. Its a small village, but very beautiful. I have bought a castle there. And its a very very comfortable place. And the people are also very nice. So there were also some communists, were coming. And they said they wanted some 5 star hotel. I said you are not communist then if you want 5 star hotel. But we have very beautiful hotels, a very beautiful area. Abosultely. Its in a valley, rivers flowing, very beautiful. And if this works out, then we can have a very international forum. 

Person2: whic date Shri Mataji ?

Lady: 25th, 27th ??.

SM: ?? you should also come. Because you could lead them very well. You see they are more younger people and I think your guidance will definitely will be of a very great help. You see they are very well read people of Islam, I must say. And one of them evne knows Mubarak, But as you know in Algeria, and Egypt, all these places are having great trouble from the fundamentalists.

Person2: He says that this is exactly the problem today. He says that before this kind of revolution with the present government, Mr. Abbas Madani??, the chief of fundamentalist in Algeria, before he was in prison, he used to phone him and to speak with him about the reality of Islam and listen to him.

SM: But they don’t want. They are ??. They don’t

Perosn2: He says this man is moderate, he doen’t know. That’s all. So he told him that he should come to Algeria so that they can speak about this problem and try to solve all these, but definitely?? the government of Algeria and the French government didn’t want that to happen. SM: No no. Its dangerous to them, they are blind. 

1.06.48

Person2: He says that the people is almost lost because he was betrayed for 25 years. And now there is the unemployment, there is debt, there is all the social problems. And they do not know what to do.

SM: But the solution is not the fundamentalism.

Person2: He said that he cannot held Quran in one hand and problems in another one to solve the problems.

SM: Because you see, they to extremes. One side they will become fundamentalism, another side they become over indulgent, corrupt, make money.

Person2: According to him, Shri Mataji, the definition of fundamentalism is that this is opressed people who reacted towards dictator and this ?? didn’t had any knowledge, they just reacted to ??. This is his definition.

SM: Action and reaction , true. But you see, they are creating a problem in their own country with their own brothers. You see their own country is messed up. So Sahaja yoga is in the centre.

Person2: He has been asked to condemn this man and he said no, I don’t want to condemn him. You asked me to ?? negotiation.

SM: You never approach him in that way. You never approach. You should not condemn him. But you should tell him once that this is your own country. These are your own people. You are killing your own brothers. Now, what is the solution? Why they are doing this and why you are doing this? Because you are in ignorance, you are in dark. If they see the light, they will see it clearly. This is why they should see the divine light. Then they will see that its stupid. Because the government will also realise that this is stupid and they will also realise that this is stupid. Why, you see, now what has happened in Iran is a good example. They fought, the Shah, they fought, I mean they thought he was not ?? But now what is their situation, have the improved? Are they better off? Whatever their condition was at the time of Shah, it is much worst. So this is an example to be put to all this fundamentalist that you will not achieve anything. Now the best way is that the government people should be given realisation so they will become non-corrupt. And the fundamentalists also, the leaders are given realisation, they will solve all [problems]??. There are 500 people already in Algeria who are realised souls. Alright, we have one barrister Achalan, he is a realised soul. His parents are realised souls, his sisters are realised souls. They came to London.

So they have to come to the middle path. Because its obvious once they, this militant people come in, they will become equally corrupt.

Person2: He says, Gemmini?? is saying that in english we say fundamentalist and in French we say integralist. ?? . Because if they were integralist they will be integrated and they are not integrated. Thats what you have said.

SM: You see the human beings, whether you are Christian, Hindu, Muslim are just the same ?? human beings. Alright. Once, you see, they get the power they get corrupted. They are very few people cannot be corrupted. But, any body, whether you come from fundamentalism or come from this, they are corrupt. Only after selfrealisation this doesn’t happen. You see now we have people from 55 nations. Some from poor countries, some from rich country, some for say who have just come out of communism, all kinds; but nobody cheats. Everything is opnen. We also actually don’t need much money. Is done extremely spontaneously, is a living organism. I am so bad at banking, money. I am absolutely hopeless. Very bad. So they have to writed cheques for me. So, despite that, you see we have no organisation, we have no president, we have no ??. And I have never seen them fighting or quarreling, never. No argument. But, we pull each others legs, (that is ) alright. Its alright. And such purity. No body runs with anybody’s wife, no body looks at anybody’s wife, such purity. No problem on that point, no problem at all. You see just their eyes becomes so innocent. Can you imagine? This all is there for everyone. My husband says you have made them angels. ?? .

Person2: He is asking, how many people in the world are doing Sahaja yoga. I said few ?? or thousands, but its difficult to say, excluding India. Because India is much more.

SM: We can’t say. We are bad at mathematics.

Person2: But we can make a kind of count. You are travelling for 23 years Shri Mataji giving 20 conferences per year minimum. And every conference thousands of people, so.

SM: In Russia 16000, 18000. in India like that 16000, 18000. There are places where I never expected. I am surprised. Never expected. Just spreading like fire. And how they have changed you know. They were all, some of them were very great cheats in the government. They have given up. I never told them don’t drink. They don’t drink. Drugs they gave up overnight. I never told. If I tell them half of them will go away. No smoking. I mean its such a pure life. And they enjoy their virtue. I don’t have say don’t do. They just know what is ??. Yesterday, those who were playing, come from a community in India which is called as a scheduled caste, the lowest. And my brother worked on them; and look at them, can you believe? How talented they are. And we have many musicians muslims. They played in my presence and suddenly they got it. And they are famous all over the world. Person2: He could see the sincerity. 

SM: Very sincere, simple and straight forward.

[Shri Mataji talking with others]

SM: See doctor she is cured. Person3: I don’t say nothing is impossible. Everything is possible.

SM: But we should open ourselves, doctor. You see as a scientist we must have an open mind. There could be something beyond science also. Which?? was parasympathetic that doctors don’t know. There are so many things they don’t know. So go to the basis. The fundamentals. Is much easier.

[Shri Mataji talking with others. someone is cured of arthritis]

They should not wear black any more in Iran, they should not. Its over now. No more. Its finished.

Person2: I am explaining Shri Mataji, that, all that you are doing that you are curing people, giving realisation, but you are also giving the power to realised souls to do the same

SM: Of course. Of course. No doubt. You can cure also. Of course. It hardly takes one month to master it. One month. Not seven years of education of medical science. I did the same thats why.

[Shri Mataji talking with others]

Person3: We have so many problem in Iran, everyday we think ??

Person2: We keep on thinking about all this problems going on.

SM: But with sahaja yoga that you don’t think and problems are solved

[Shri Mataji talking with others]
