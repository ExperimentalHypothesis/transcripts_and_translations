Maintaining purity of Sahaja Yoga, Caxton Hall, 8th of October, 1979

.... has his own way for some time. I said, let him try.

Douglas Fry: I’m not using a loudspeaker I’m just recording you. It’s just for recording.

Shri Mataji: Oh, it is not a loudspeaker.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s just a tape.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see

...and, he had started, you see, doing some sort of tricks which I did feel about him that he had started doing some tricks about his Realisation. Because that’s the only thing one has to be very careful that one can get into. And he had gathered spirits, because he got interested in curing too much. I told him not to cure anymore. I said you can give my photograph, but don’t get into curing part, because if you get the spirits you wouldn’t even know and you will be insensitive to it and then you will have problems. And then he had such funny spirits in him that, those people who came to him, were influenced to give him money by those spirits. And some people were compelled, I mean they couldn’t help it. The only idea that worked into their heads was that they must give money to him! But this was nothing, he started showing my photograph in the eyes and a photograph of Sai Baba in the eyes and all sorts of nonsensical things.

Shri Mataji: Hello. How are you?

Sahaja Yogi: I’m fine

Shri Mataji: How is your back?

Sahaja Yogi: My back? I’m thankful that I’ve got one.

Shri Mataji: And that’s how he did lots of bad things. So one has to be careful, when you see somebody, this happening to someone who has gone ahead, be careful about it because ego can betray you. He felt that he was a great Sahaja Yogi and he was doing such a lot of work and he must do a lot of curing.

Actually your attention should not be too much on curing because if you catch also you would not know after some time and the whole thing will become...

Shri Mataji: Hello Sudha, how are you? Come forward.

So now we have to be very, very careful as to what we are doing and how we are going to go ahead with Sahaja Yoga. We have to keep the purity of Sahaja Yoga – is shuchita (शुचिता); it’s called as shuchita - is the purity of Sahaja Yoga. You must understand Sahaja Yoga in its pure form and that now, when you have got the yoga, you have to settle down and also purify yourself in relation to Sahaj Yog. Because so far, you have not felt the Absolute, before getting Realisation. See, Realisation is that you become one with the Absolute, you know the Absolute. Once you know the Absolute then only you can know the relative. Unless and until you know the Absolute you are in confusion because everything is relative. And that’s why nobody knows what is really right and what is not. So you have to have an absolute point, like you have one metre in Paris, which is a fixed thing, then when you say it is ten metres, then it is ten times of that metre which is in Paris. But because we have not found out our Absolute we are in confusion and, in that confusion, anybody can take advantage of it. So the first thing is that we must find out our Absolute and the Absolute is the Spirit.

Spirit is existing and creating waves without any percussion. For example, if I have to make a sound I have to clap my hand with, one to another. Or else you can understand this way: supposing you throw a stone in the pond then the waves start rising in the pond. That means the stone has to hit the water to create that pattern of waves, but can you think of some stone which is in the pond without any percussion creating the sound? That’s why it is said that Spirit is nishpanda. We shouldn’t say it doesn’t vibrate, it does vibrate, but doesn’t create the spandana (pulsation). It is not a thing that goes into any percussion. Just without any percussion it creates. For example, I am sitting here, you can feel my vibrations, the waves are coming, without any percussion. It just emits.

In the same way, your Spirit when you feel it, when you touch it through your Kundalini, when it is awakened – it is an awakened thing, but when it is connected with your attention – then your attention receives those waves without percussion, which flow in your hands as chaitanya-lahari, as these waves. And because it is coming from the Absolute, you can get a complete answer about the Absolute from this. And, on this point, so many people have got Realisation in it: that you can ask any absolute question and have a Realisation.

That’s why first is Yoga, then kshema. First is the Yoga means the unity or, as called in Sanskrit, yukti of your attention, is called as jeeva, and your Spirit, called as Shiva. These two must meet. Unless and until they meet you cannot reach your Absolute. And once you have felt the Absolute you can decide all the rest relatively. In Sanskrit it is ‘apara', is Absolute. That there is no paraspara, means there is nothing relative about it. It’s an absolute thing.

But, as you have seen, that to know it also, you take time. Fully to be submerged into it you take time. This growth takes time and that’s why one has to be careful, not only careful but one has to be alert and one has to work it out. To be absolutely one with it, one has to mature. The maturity-point starts when the germination starts. If you are not even germinated how will you mature? So the maturity starts after Realisation, you start also kshema, you get your kshema - means your well-being - after Yoga and then you gradually start maturing. And once you mature understandingly, properly you have to keep a certain amount of purity, shuchita; that one has to keep. If you do not keep that shuchita, that purity, within yourself and that truthfulness about it, you won’t progress that fast. I mean it is nobody else’s business, it is your own business. It is for you to do it. If you don’t do it you are the loser.

I mean the attitude of all the seekers has to be that of a seeker, that means you are seeking and when you are seeking you are asking for it, you are asking for a gift. Now whatever is to be done for getting that gift one has to do; with full understanding, with full maturity.

Now when the maturity starts also...in the beginning some people are quiet confused. If they are able to get out of that confusion then they can establish themselves. But if they cannot and they still remain in the same confusion then they can be there, they can be lost and they can never get out of it. This confusion has to be fought, has to be faced, has to be seen.

Now the confusion comes because of conditionings you have had. Lots of conditionings you have had. You have had lots of brainwashing, also you have had physical problems, mental problems and also the atmosphere and all kinds of other things that have spoiled your instrument. But because of Kundalini awakening your chakras get enlightenment and as, through enlightenment, you can see everything. Now, if there is no enlightenment in this room you just don’t know how to correct it. But when there is enlightenment you start correcting yourself and rising higher and higher.

Some people achieve maturity much faster than the others, despite the fact they may have been ruined by many, but still they do it.  What does it work? What makes it very quick? It’s the Left side, what we call as the Mahakali’s Power or we can call it as Iccha Shakti, the power of desiring. If the power of desiring is very strong and comes from your heart, absolutely from your heart, then it works much faster. So one has to develop an innate feeling from the heart. See, nobody else is going to look at you. If you want you can deceive yourself. If you want you can lag behind. But only from your heart you have to feel it, that you have to mature into it, you have to come up to it. Once you put your heart to it everything will work out because the whole force is coming from your heart, because in the heart resides the Spirit.

So [the] only judging point is, “Am I doing it from my heart? Am I doing it superficially?” And only [the] thing that you do from your heart gives you real joy. And when you really do it from your Spirit then it should give you the greatest happiness and joy. And you yourself now, so many of you, are receiving the blessings of joy: the blessings of oneness with others, friendship, the pure friendship, pure relationships of just enjoying each other’s Spirit; not anything else, not the body, not the mind, the intellectual pursuits and talking and all that, but just feeling each other’s Spirit, and the fragrance of that.

So nice to see you all again here!

Now, we have problems of different types: I think it is more pertaining to the country, and pertaining to the...I would say it’s little localised type, like Bombay people have their own problems, and Delhi people have their own problem. And most of them have the same style, it’s most surprising. And people from a particular village: and the style of that village is, they have their own problems. So the Mother soil has also to do something about it.

Now in Bombay I would say we have really some very great Sahaja Yogis, very deep people. But so far, the social side has been very poor, in the sense it didn’t spread this way. It went very deep. And the roots have to go down. And there are very few roots that are really required, but branches didn’t spread out.

Delhi is another. Delhi are like branches they went round like that. And I think London are the fruits I should say or the flowers here, the way things are. But [they are] very vulnerable, very vulnerable, because of being so placed. And so many bees are hovering around.

All kinds of problems are there facing you, of developing immunity to all sorts of surroundings. Now if I exclude you completely from the madding crowd, as you call it, then it will happen that you may not develop that immunity which you should have. And if you go too near to these people also you might be affected - which you do get affected - because there are horribly negative people here. So the best thing would be that, first of all, you develop yourself, your Sahaja Yogis together. Develop good bonds among yourselves and form a group and then go on enlarging that group, as a whole. And that would be the best way we can all be protected. And somehow it is working out that way. I am very happy. You have taken a very sane attitude towards things.

Now talking to other people about Sahaja Yoga and about this method of Realisation, which is the only method, I find that in the West already people have gone on other lines. To them sex is more important than anything else, to them money is more important than anything else. [These] sort of things are there. So when you talk to them about it they may recoil on that point. So you have to sit down and develop a ‘brain-trust’ among yourselves. Because it’s a very delicate matter - how to impress these people. Instead of impression you might create depression in their minds! So best thing is to sit down and discuss among yourselves because you are one of them and they are one of you and you know what are their problems, how certain things are suddenly accentuated so much. And the main argument would be, “What’s wrong?” That’s what I have faced! “What’s wrong? “What goes wrong with it?” Unless and until they come to Kundalini awakening they would not know what’s wrong. Because then they will see for themselves that the Kundalini is stopped and it wouldn’t rise because of this point and this point. But they won’t come! So how to bring the bull to the fodder, that’s the problem.

Somehow or another you have to sit down, all of you - because now [today] we have mostly Sahaja Yogis - and find out ways and methods of how to approach these people. One day you have a discussion among yourselves. Because I may not be such a good guide on that point. I think you would be the best to deal with the intellectuals of this country and the leaders of this country and the people who are supposed to be models and ideals for the rest of the people.

So you can see for yourself what is so impressive about them and how to bring this to their heads that if you do all these things which you do not see how harmful they could be.

But for that, you know, in India what they have done for example as I was talking to you about Rajneesh: Three or four Doctors got hold of some of the people who have been to Rajneesh, you see. Because they became a little nutty there. They got hold of them and then they examined them thoroughly and then they found out what was the matter and they published a paper about it. Like that, if you can [do something]. Because you see they had complete faith in righteousness, in leading a sane life and all that, so they wanted to know whether they were correct or not. When they found out those people and they found out the problems they had, naturally they could write about it.

Something like that should be done, I think, to convince people that these methods if you take to, though apparently they do not show any bad results, but inside they create such problems and vacuums and they are so injurious and how ego itself is injurious and how ego is pampered by these things. If you could talk to them in that fashion it would be a good idea. That’s for the Sahaja Yogis. If you have any questions you can ask me, then we’ll deal with the newcomers who have come down.

From the Sahaja Yogis, any questions? I haven’t seen John, Don.

Sahaja Yogi: John’s in Cambridge now.

Shri Mataji: He is still there?

Sahaja Yogi: He’s gone there now.

Shri Mataji: So now, joined it? Yah? So anyone of you has any questions on Sahaja Yoga you ask Me, that’s better. Then I’ll talk to the new people.

So how are you? Better? Everyone seems to be very much better. How are you Lindsay?

Lindsay: Perfect.

Shri Mataji: Tumza kasakai? Thik ahe ekdam?

Yogini: Ekdam.

She has written a poem in Sanskrit.

For your information Rajesh is also getting married now. He is marrying a girl from England, she is Chandaria, you might have seen that one. You must have seen her? Some of you have seen her. And she’s a very good girl. So our family is going to increase now in size. So, no questions? Something? Sandor (Elès)? All in thoughtless awareness? (laughing)

I mean the name of our Sahaja Yoga is really Maha Yoga, is the one where you meet [God]. So this is a Maha Yoga. Because the whole thing has been sahaja only. From the very beginning it is spontaneous, everything, I mean our nose, eyes everything has come to us spontaneous, we have done nothing about it. But now the thing where we really meet the Ultimate, that’s the point is called as ‘Maha Yog’ - means the greatest yoga. Like till I came here, till you didn’t see me, it was still half way, so yoga was not there, whatever it was it was not real yoga, you see, you are making preparations, you are making all the arrangements and everything was there, but when we meet is the yoga. So the point where you meet is the real place and that’s why it is the Maha Yoga. Like you, I am coming to London by plane, till Frankfurt I am not in London, till I have landed in London also I am not there because I haven’t yet met you. Till I have met you at the gate there was no yoga, so that’s the point, that’s the moment, the split of the moment where you meet your Spirit, is the Yoga. So it is actually Maha Yoga, but in the beginning I didn’t want to call it a Maha Yoga because as it is the serpents of ego were there with all their complete hood on top of my head! So I said, “Better start it with ‘Sahaja’,” because if I said, “This is Maha Yoga,” they would all come and hit me hard saying that, “Oh God, how can that be?” But it is that! And now it is being established that there is something about it, that it is working out; because people have seen their Kundalini rising. They have seen all the chakras being awakened and everything with their own eyes and now they believe in it, that they know that there is something about it and that it is happening and there’s something about this lady also, that this is happening. Otherwise it is a difficult thing. I mean it is very difficult, no doubt. To raise the Kundalini is very difficult. But it would be something like a very naive person trying to do something, you know, like first putting the hands in the plug, then writing one book that, “Kundalini means, you get a shock.” Then another book that, “Electricity means you get another shock.” Like that three, four books will come out like that and people would start believing that electricity means that you get a shock, you get a heart-attack, you start jumping with it. But the one who knows what is electricity is the only one who is a Sahaja Yogi. But the one who, supposing, has done all the job of connections and things is the best engineer and for such a person everything is just a play.

About certain diseases in this country also I have been able to find out what we can do; one of them is this gout, or what you call this arthritis - it’s absolutely curable. But I was thinking we need not tell them how we do it, because let them come to Realisation, then we’ll give them. It’s very simple.

Shri Mataji: Is there somebody suffering from that? You are? Alright, that is because ...

Seeker: In my neck.

Shri Mataji: In your neck?

Seeker: Not desperately bad.

Shri Mataji: Yes, but still, still, it will work out, in no time. I can tell you how it is to be done. But that’s where I may not help you, but all others can. It is because of too much vibrations there, you are getting it. So if somebody, any Sahaja Yogi can put the hand, Regis  you put your hand on his back and on his this thing and just put your hand outside and it will be all going out in the atmosphere.

Yogi: Did you manage to bring any of the books back? (The Advent)

Shri Mataji: The books? The books (laughing) You know your Sahaja Yogi disciples, your Sahaja Yogi friends I should say, or your brothers and sisters are ashamed about it. But what to do? You see this is our country is getting expert in being inefficient and they also started some strike in the ports so the ships were not sent; they stopped sending all the ships from Bombay. So most of the ships were coming from Calcutta or from Madras. So I told them you better send all the books to Madras or to Calcutta and send them over, but then it was a very hazardous things to do. Somebody has to go with the books and all the way in the, they have to go by train and somebody has to put them. So then I told them that what is the maximum time? Then they said, fifteenth of this month a ship is leaving. I said alright, so we can expect it within say a month’s time from the fifteenth onward. So the books would be down here very soon. Before that you make all the preparations and things for the book. And they said that, “There is no income-tax for books in England and we were unnecessarily worrying about it.”

So  the books are already, all packed up. They wanted to send a load with me but I said, “Now who is going to pay for the freight?” Because if I had come by Air India I could have brought a big thing, but I couldn’t come by Air India so also I couldn’t bring the thing. But doesn’t matter, it will be coming in any case.

And people have given very great reports about the book, that it has come out very well and is very nicely explained, most of the things. But one has to go into details now. Somebody is translating it in Marathi and also in Hindi. But We have to go now into details of many things.

Now in the book still it is not mentioned that this is the Last Judgment. I don’t know if I have told you already that this is the Last Judgment about which we have been hearing. This is how you are going to be judged and that part we have not yet said in the book, which one has to see. After all, this is how you are going to be judged, what else?

Gregoire is learning German now somewhere. I never received any letter from him but some were saying that he’s got his address, his brother’s address also. You should find out!

But some other books should come out from you people. A smaller book which can be given to people who are not yet Realised, or something - would be much better.

Who are all the new people who have come today? Can you come forward?

Please come! Please come! Come on. Come along, come along. Yes, come forward. Sit down here! Sit down!

It’s very simple! Who else?

Please come forward, all those who have come for the first time, or who are not yet Realised!

Shri Mataji: How are you, I am asking. How is he? Alright? Ha? Alright now? How are you keeping?

Yogi: A bit better now. A bit better.

Shri Mataji: Heart? Still? But you’re much better now?

Yogi: Much better.

Shri Mataji: Much better eh?

Just put your hands straight like this. Can you take out your socks, it would be better. You see we have to use the Mother Earth to take away some of our problems. If you could take out your socks please. Just put them down on the ground like that, straight! Just straight on the ground! Yeah?

Just hold your ears and it will go away. What’s it? It’s his Agnya is a little bit. Close your eyes. Just close your eyes! Just close your eyes!

Their Agnya is very strong.

You’ve come for the first time there? You’ve got your Realisation?

Seeker: Pardon

Shri Mataji: Have you felt your vibrations?

Seeker: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Good! Where is Rustom?

Yogini: I don’t know he should be here.

Shri Mataji: He’s done lot of good.

Let it be recorded, this will be good. What they do is to record all my vibrations and superimpose the lecture on that. So it has a double effect. What do you say it is?

Yogis: Left Nabhi.

Shri Mataji: This lady? It’s better? What do you say? Hmm?

Yogi: Right Nabhi.

Shri Mataji: Right Nabhi. That’s all?

Yogi: Right Vishuddhi.

Shri Mataji: Right? All right [side]?

Yogini: Yes!

Shri Mataji: And this one?

Yogi: Left Nabhi.

Shri Mataji: Left Nabhi?

Yogini: Left Vishuddhi!

Shri Mataji: All left.

Ok, raise your Kundalini! They’ll get it. You all raise your Kundalini, all of you. Tie it up.

Just say the mantra, my mantra and just raise your Kundalini!

(Yogis take Mother’s three maha mantras.)

I mean, try this one, is, “Twameva sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.” That’s all! To establish me as Nirmala Devi is the point.

Yogis: Om twameva sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.

(They say it three times)

Shri Mataji: Say it seven times.

Yogis: Om  twameva sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha. (they say it four times more)

Shri Mataji: Ha! Just see the vibrations! Let’s see, it’s alright! Feeling the cool air, cool in the hand?

Yogini: Hmm!

Shri Mataji: Feeling it, cool breeze like this? What about you? Not yet? Yes, it will work out.

What about you? Put her left to the right. You went to some Guru or somebody? No? Did you take to drugs? Never?

Seeker: Cigarrettes.

Yogi: Cigarettes.

Shri Mataji: What’s that?

Yogi: Smoking.

Shri Mataji: Smoking? Only ordinary cigarettes? Not that another style?

She’s got it! Can you just see here? Close your eyes please, I care for it. Hmm?

Put your attention absolutely loose! You are not to do anything, alright? Just leave it alone. Just don’t put it on a particular point, just leave it alone! Then it will work out! It has to just go up so just leave it alone! Close your eyes!

What do you say? Peter? Left to the right.

Peter: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Raise left to the right.

Now, raise the Kundalini! If Hamsa is catching you have to say Pranava or you can say Omkara, if you say Pranava or ‘Omkar’, you see, Om. The mantra for that. Try! Just say,  “Twameva sakshat Omkar sakshat.” Just say that for the Hamsa!

Yogis: Om  twameva sakshat Shri Omkara sakshat Shri Adi Shakti sakshat Shri Bhagawati sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha. (the Yogis say it twice)

Shri Mataji: See! See now! Vibrations have started from you?

Yogis: hmm.

Especially for TM people!

Hello, Hester come along! May God bless you!

You have been very dynamic? (laughing)

Hester Spiro: I couldn’t come sooner.

Shri Mataji: See! What do you say? Peter? It’s come to the Sahasrara. Alright?

For Sahasrara it’s “Moksha Dayini" works out better, the Mantra. Just try!

Yogis: Om  twameva sakshat Shri Moksha Dayini sakshat Shri Adi Shakti sakshat Shri Bhagawati sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha. (Yogis say it three times)

Shri Mataji: He’s got it! He’s got it now.

Peter: Left and right, to centre-heart.

Shri Mataji: It’s the centre-heart. But his vibrations are coming.

Little bit hold your breath! Little bit hold your breath please.

You must have done some pranayama. have you done some pranayama? The breathing-exercise?

Seeker: Only a very small bit.

Shri Mataji: You have done it. Hold your breath for a while, please!

Om sakshat Jagadamba, Om sakshat Jagadamba, Om sakshat Jagadamba Om sakshat Jagadamba.

Now alright? Tie it! Tie it up. All of you tie it up! If you tie it up, your own, you see, it will keep that thing tied up.

It’s better now? Put your hands like this!

(Break in recording)

Shri Mataji: You have little heart, is it? So you come forward. Let’s see. You come forward and call him also. Hmm, let’s see. Come forward! Just be seated with your both the hands towards me. Alright! So all of you can do it now, sit down! Now, just put it. You all say the mantra on heart, of Shiva.

Yogis: Om twameva sakshat Shri Shiva Parvati sakshat Shri Adi Shakti sakshat Shri Bhagawati sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha. (Yogis say it three times)

Shri Mataji: Say the Atma Paramatma – alright?

Yogis: Om twameva sakshat Shri Atma Paramatma sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Shri Bhagawati sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.

Shri Mataji: Say it again!

Yogis: (like above)

Shri Mataji: Again!

Yogis: (repeat)

Shri Mataji: Is it better now?

Yogis: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Hmm? Put your right hand again on the heart. Let’s see. Is it better? Is it?

You all people raise your left to the right, would be better. Left to the right! Thrice!

Do it fully, with heart in it.  Do it with the full heart.

Now raise your Kundalini, come along! You are alright. Both are alright, you have to work on her. She will be alright, don’t you worry, I’m just trying to work it out. Alright?

Are you getting cool breeze in the hand? It’s good. Alright. Great, ha? Now what about her? Marcus?

Marcus: Vishuddhi.

Shri Mataji: Both? Both?

Marcus: Hot.

Shri Mataji: You are too young to smoke, isn’t it? When did you start?

Lady: A long time ago.

Shri Mataji: Now you are alright, isn’t it? You are alright aren’t you. It’s better! You’re this Hamsa is a problem. You did Pranayama, isn’t it?

Seeker: Just a meditation with a candle before.

Shri Mataji: Here? Alright, that’s why! It’s very bad here. But you are alright otherwise? Do you feel alright?

What sort of a meditation you did? What was the name?

Seeker: I was reading books and it was a meditation with a candle.

Shri Mataji: Oh!

Now. Better? I think keep your eyes open might help. That’s it, that’s Sahaja Yoga really does that job. You did it for many years? And there was no picture, nothing?  On your own you did it? Just like that? This Lombard fellow, is it? Is that him?

Yogi: No.

Shri Mataji: But who taught you this, prathak? Who told you about this style? Who was the man?

Seeker: I read a book, some book about ??.

Shri Mataji: That’s why you get this wobbling here. How is it?

Wobbling? In the head?

Seeker: (unclear)

Shri Mataji: You see, the whole thing gets upset with this concentration.

This is why you were getting all this trouble.

Better now is he? Settled down? Ha? Better. Some patterns I have to teach you also that you have to make. Better now?

Yogi: A little. Nabhi.

Shri Mataji: Ha?

Yogi: What I feel is left Nabhi.

Shri Mataji: Left ... better?

(aside:) Just it takes away the energy.

Now better? Hmm, better now! Much better! That’s why you met with an accident, you know? Because of this done by left.

Another Yogi: Left  Vishuddhi. I told you left Vishuddhi!

Shri Mataji: Yes. Left, you know that. But it’s very bad.

Better now?

Ah!  Now, better now?

Yogi: Left Agnya!

Shri Mataji: Cleared out!

Yogi: Left Agnya!

Shri Mataji: Now? Left Agnya. Alright!

Yogi: Left Agnya.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Yogi: It’s spinning from Left Heart and Left Agnya.

Shri Mataji: Left Heart? It’s alright, it’s alright, it is just ??

Now they have become active, you see? Now! Good! Ha? Left! See how active it is. You can see the difference between this and that! Now?

Cleared out?

Give Bandhan to these new people here. Better.

Ah! Give a bandhan to the Right Swadishthan.

Ha! Raise it! Still on the left? You see he touched his Realisation. Now.

Yogini: Vishnugranthi

Shri Mataji: Ha?

Yogini: Vishnugranthi! Yeah!

Shri Mataji: Is it?

Yogi: Right Vishuddhi. Yes! It is alright Vishuddhi.

Shri Mataji: Right Vishuddhi? Right Vishuddhi yes.

Hmm! Right Vishuddhi mantra is: Twameva sakshat Vitthala Rukumayi sakshat ...

Yogi: Vitthala?

Shri Mataji: Vitthala Rukumayi!

Yogi: Vitthala Rukumayi.

Shri Mataji: Aha.

Yogis: Om  twameva sakshat Shri Vitthala Rukumayi sakshat Shri Adi Shakti sakshat Shri Bhagawati sakshat Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha. (Yogis say it three times.)

Shri Mataji: Hmm. Good? (laughing) Yes?

If the Mantras are awakened, how powerful they can be! Alright?

It’s good now? Is he Realised? Getting the vibrations?

Let’s do it this way! Now, put your hands towards Me!

I tell you, you see, if somebody doesn’t get the vibrations – why? If you turn on the Swadishthana like that, or on the Sahasrara, like this, you see, it works out! Come and see for yourself! Come! Come! Just turn it! See now how it is. It’s better? Just loose. Just turn it like a knob. You see, it is actually the damaru (डमरू) of Shiva. Damaru is that thing

Yogi: Drum!

Shri Mataji: Drum! That’s the drum. Alright? Getting cool breeze?

That hand!

Just try, he too has a heart-trouble. Just try somebody on him. Come along!

Marcus or someone. Just try on him!

Gavin, you just try! This way!

Put one hand towards me and put your on the... you can help each other!

Just put your hand, left hand towards Me! No! No! On the left hand. Yes on the left hand!

Yes! Like this! Little open fingers, open fingers!

Yes, like that.

See?

Rustom: It’s very powerful

Shri Mataji: For your Heart to open out it is.

Yogi: He’s certainly got a very hot Left Heart ...

Shri Mataji: Left Heart is, it’s opening out. You see, first it will become hot and then it will become alright, you see.

Yogi: Agnya is hot.

Shri Mataji: It is going to the Heart, you see? Now to the Agnya. Now turn to the Agnya. Turn your Agnya!

Alright! Sit down comfortably!

Rustom’s gone!! (Shri Mataji laughs)

Back Agnya, is it? Back Agnya. Haaa! Haaa! Done.

Another Yogi: Hamsa is still ...

Shri Mataji: Hamsa is the point, you see, Hamsa is the point. Take it out from my Hamsa is the best way, you see?

You’ve done the greatest harm to your Hamsa. That’s the thing you have done. Just put your hand like towards him.

How many people must be doing like this, isn’t it, in this world! This man who has published the book must be prosecuted!

Put your hand towards Me!

Really, they should be prosecuted. They have no business to teach such methods from which you get headaches, you get all kinds of problems.

Just give hime, give him your vibration!

Rustom: It also goes to right Heart, I think Mother. Across! Then up to Right Vishuddhi. Circular thing.

Shri Mataji: Sarva Chakra Vibhedini. You just say, if it is going from one to another you just say Sarva Chakra Vibhedini.

Yogis: Om  twameva sakshat Shri Sarva Chakra Vibhedini sakshat Shri Adi Shakti sakshat Shri Bhagawati sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.

Shri Mataji: Say it! (Shri Mataji laughs very loud.)

Yogi: Say it again?

Shri Mataji: Again, again!

Yogis: Om  twameva sakshat ...

Shri Mataji: Right among the other!

Yogis: ...Shri Sarva Chakra Vibhedini sakshat Shri Adi Shakti sakshat Shri Bhagawati sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha. (then a third time)

Shri Mataji: Alright now? What do you feel in both the hands? It is alright! Much better! Put yourself into Bandhan! May God bless you! He’s alright. Keep it up!

For you the mantra is ‘Omkaar’. For the Hamsa. Omkaar. It will work out. It’s better now. You see, it’s very much spoiled, you know. Be careful! So say Omkar, Omkara always. It will keep you alright! Just now it is all troubling you from all angles.

Alright, may God bless you!

Now let’s have you here.

I would like to see all of you, today, because we are all, most of us are Sahaja Yogis. Just see. Just you put your hands under my feet, let’s see what the problem is - heart. It is a low blood pressure also. Low blood pressure.

Yogi: Left Swadishthana

Rustom: He worked in a cemetery.

Shri Mataji: No, you said you had given up.

Yogis: I used to work in a cemetery.

Shri Mataji: Still there! You hold it here, it’s the best. Just here.

What I find is that your Superego gets combined here just forming a loop. Just hold it tight! Hmm. Now!

Yogi: Left is week.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Rustom: From the Mooladhara.

Shri Mataji: Cemetery! Hmm. Better!

I’m sakshat Mahakali, I’m sakshat Mahakali, I’m sakshat Mahakali. Haaa!

Rustom: Clean up to Heart. Heart and Left Vishuddhi..

Shri Mataji: Hmm!

Yogi: ??

Shri Mataji: (laughs very loud:) Ha ha ha!

Another Yogi: We had some frighteners when you were away! (laughing)

Shri Mataji: You see?

Rustom: It’s up to Vishuddhi now.

Shri Mataji: Horrible things these cemeteries are! All over London!

It’s burning!

All the cemeteries I give them a bandhan. All the cemeteries of London and England.

Better now?

Yogi: It has opened up.

Rustom: He’s also, I don’t know if he works too hard, but his Swadishthan is catching.

Shri Mataji: No, no, he’s alright! He’s alright. You see this is the only cemetery business. You have brought with you the problems of those people of the cemetery. They should take their birth now and they should come back to get their liberation. So it’s good in a way. How are you better?

Yogi: Yeah, I get a lot of heat.

Shri Mataji: Now what has happening just now? Better now? Is cool coming in?

Yogi: Yeah, it’s coming in better now.

Shri Mataji: So, you write the name of the cemetery. Get it nice now!

Yogi: Symmetry?

Shri Mataji: Cemetery!

Yogi: Oh, cemetery!

Shri Mataji: So that! When you write that you beat all the people who are there. Give it a bandhan. Alright? and they take away, alright?

Gavin Brown: So Mother, if it’s the Last Judgment then there must be the resurrection so that they come.

Shri Mataji: That’s why they have to come! You see that’s a good thing. This is the last judgment! I didn’t tell you this?

Yogi: You did yes.

Shri Mataji: Alright. You have to be alright! Population that’s why it is increasing.

Good. May God bless you!

I will see this girl now. Let’s see what’s the matter with here. Come and sit here, facing that side! Now,face that side! Come along! What’s your name?

Seeker: Helen.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Helen: Helen!

Shri Mataji: Helen. Now, you be careful, alright? Just sit like that! Can you ...

Yogi: Bring your feet forward Helen.

Shri Mataji: Now with the, what do you call them? Crossed legs? Can you? Yes, come along! Now let me see, what’s the matter here? Oh God, you didn’t get any pain over there?

Helen: No.

Shri Mataji: No? It’s like a spondylitis. It is.

Haaaa! What’s the time now?

Rustom: Twenty to eight Mother.

Shri Mataji: But I have to see all of you on my feet.

Hello! How are you?

Rustom: Three more new people have just come.

Shri Mataji: Yes. Whom you have given Realisation.

Hello! Come here, I would like to meet the new people. Hmm!

This Lady?

Yogi: She’s the mother of Malcolm [Murdoch], she came to You before.

Shri Mataji: Ahh! So changed, you know!

Sit down! Sit down! Come along! Please be seated! Yes! Come! Come up!

Hello. He’s very good. I saw him there. Get a chair for yourself.

Now, can you put your both the hands under my feet? Hmm? Be careful now! Oh God! It is very hot, na? Ah, your hands are very hot! I never knew smoking could be that bad.

Seeker: I don’t smoke that much.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Rustom: She doesn’t smoke that much Mother.

Shri Mataji: No, that’s why I am saying. Did you say any Mantras or something?

Yogini: No, Shri Mataji.

Rustom: Have you said any Mantras?

Seeker: No.

Shri Mataji: No? Nothing?

Yogi: I can ask her. What work do you do?

Shri Mataji: What work do you do?

Seeker: None at the moment.

Yogi: Have you done anything in the past?

Seeker: I have been a student for three years.

Rustom: She has been a student, Mother!

What else?

Shri Mataji: Hmm! What student? Hmm?

Seeker: Arts!

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Seeker: Arts!

Shri Mataji: Arts. But you have been getting colds and things like that, in your past?

Seeker: No.

Shri Mataji: There is another problem. I think, you see – here the people don’t understand hot and colds alright. That maybe the trouble. Her Vishuddhi is completely frozen.

How are you? You need to tell me your names now I would like to know. A little loudly, because really I am not very good at English names. Come along let’s have it!

Yogi: Kingsley.

Shri Mataji: Kingsley? What a nice name.

Yogini: Sarah!

Shri Mataji: Sarah.

Yogini: Dowling, Dowling.

Shri Mataji: Dowling?

Another Yogi: John.

Yogini: Nell!

Shri Mataji: N-E-I-L?

Yogini: No. ’N’, ‘e’, double ‘l’.

Shri Mataji: ’N’, ‘e’, double ‘l’.

Yogi: Noel.

Shri Mataji: Noel.

Yogini: Olivia, Olivia.

Shri Mataji: Olivia.

Another Yogi: Darrel.

Yogini: Grace.

Shri Mataji: How you said?

Yogini: Grace Mother

Yogi: Grace.

Shri Mataji: Grace. Grace. Aha.

They have told you all about Sahaja Yog? How to go deep into it? How to help others? How to help yourself?

From next time I will starting the series on Sahaja Yoga again. Today I just wanted to meet all of you.

So have you been, anyone of you have been to gurus or someone? No? None of you?

Yogi: You have have you?

New Australian yogi: Yes!

Shri Mataji: Which one?

New Australian yogi: I have been in India for a while studying a manual in Tibetan Buddhism.

Rustom: Tibetan Buddhists, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Oh God!

Rustom: The Agnya, he’s got a big scar right across the Agnya.

Shri Mataji: They didn’t beat you, or something?

New Australian yogi: No, they don’t beat people.

Shri Mataji: But you see one fellow who was here, he comes quiet often, what’s his name Gavin?

Yogi: Om.

Shri Mataji: They beat him also.

Yogi: Om!

Shri Mataji: Om, he calls himself ‘Om’. Poor thing.

They used to beat him. Now they have started here as well. Yesterday, there was a big programme (on the television) about these Buddhists.

Gavin: That was the one it came from. Remember that very nice one  who came to the programme?

Shri Mataji: Is it?

Gavin: He came from the same place.

Shri Mataji: Ah! Really?

Peter Pearce: They asked if you could come and give them a talk some day and I said..

Shri Mataji: But it may be against their principles, you see. Yesterday they were talking. You know, what were doing [was] nothing but offering food: how do eat the food, how to mix the food and all this nonsense you know! Where is Sahaja Yoga, and where is all this going on? So if I tell them, “All this is not going to lead you anywhere!” they might be shocked. I can go and talk to them in any case, let’s see. They won’t beat me in any case! (laughter) Because this is going too far! I watched it a little bit and I was amazed, you see. One [buddhist] brought a bowl with a ‘proper’ sort of a protocol and he sat before the person, bent his knees and gave the bowl to the other fellow who took it very seriously. (laughter) Then he mixed up something and then they made six bowls out of it! Isn’t it? All this goes on!

Peter Pearce: I didn’t see.

Shri Mataji: You didn’t go to this one?

Yogi: He was in India.

Shri Mataji: You were in India?

New Australian yogi: I’m not sure what you’re referring to.

Shri Mataji: Where did you go? You went to the same place where this TV business is?

Seeker: Ah, no - I don’t know.

Yogi: This was somewhere in England ...

Shri Mataji: Hmm, but where were you in India?

New Australian yogi: Mainly all over the himalayas.

Shri Mataji: Oh God!

Now you ask the question, “Mother, are you the Himalaya?”

Yogi: Ask: Mother are you the Himalayas?

New Australian yogi: Are you the Himalaya?

Shri Mataji: You just say, “Mother are you the Himalayas?”

New Australian yogi: Mother, are you the Himalayas?

Shri Mataji: Again.

New Australian yogi: Mother, are you the Himalayas?

Shri Mataji: Again.

New Australian yogi: Mother, are you the Himalayas?

Rustom: Perhaps he should ask you also, “Are You the Daughter of the Himalayas?”

Shri Mataji: That’s going too far! (laughter)

Is it alright now. Better? Better now?

Rustom: He’s very cool now Mother. He’s just got something in the Agnya otherwise it’s all cool.

Shri Mataji: Did they touch your forehead – these people?

New Australian yogi: They said when I was one years old there was an accident.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. They did not touch it then?

New Australian yogi: Oh no. They did a great benefit.

Rustom: They didn’t touch you here on your forehead did they?

New Australian yogi: Occasionally.

Rustom: Occasionally. How?

New Australian yogi: Like similar to the Hindu tradition.

Rustom: They put something on top?

New Australian yogi: Similar. I mean, it’s basically the same.

(Mother starts looking after another seeker, this one a woman.)

Shri Mataji: Better now? Are you better? Hmm?

You get involved with the things too much, is it? You get involved ...

New Australian yogi: Not particularly.

Shri Mataji: You keep aloof?

New Australian yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: This also can work out. If you keep aloof before Realisation.

New Australian yogi: If you keep aloof?

Shri Mataji: Aloof. You see? Before Realisation - anadikar it is. You have to become this...

Rustom: Ah I see, Shri Mataji, otherwise you just ...

Shri Mataji: You see, it is artificial. You see the point?

Rustom: So that’s why the Vishuddhi catches because she’s not involved in the play of life.

Shri Mataji: You see, she is not yet a sakshi. She should be in it. That is just like taking a sanyasa. It is artificial. This should happen to you, isn’t it? The aloofness should happen to you. You should not act as if you are aloof. You are not.

Haaa! See? Better now? Clearer?

Shri Mataji: Now let’s see the cool breeze. Just turn around.

Put your hands out. You got it? You feel cool breeze? Coming out. You got it.

Seeker: I feel Superego.

Shri Mataji: A little bit is there. But you are still a student?

Seeker: No I’ve finished now.o

Shri Mataji: You have finished now? Where were you studying?

Seeker: Manchester.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Seeker: Manchester.

Shri Mataji: And it’s over?

Seeker: It’s up north, a town up north.

Shri Mataji: Hmm. Now better, you are relaxed?

Seeker: Yeah. I had a pain in the back before but it’s gone now.

Shri Mataji: You see. Now. Better now? Her eyes are dilated, she’s alright.

She’ll be alright. She has to be given [my] photograph and she has to work out a little.

See her eyes, how much dilated they are. You see. They are looking black.

Agnya, see your Agnya! Come here, Come on! Sit forward. If you can take out your socks will be a good idea. Hmm?

Shri Mataji: You got it stitched here or...? (Mother must be referring to stiches on a cut on the seeker who went to the Tibetan Buddhists)

New Australian yogi: No, it’s from fat and oil, burning oil.

Shri Mataji: He’s a saint, so how they burn, just see! This is negative forces. How they attack a saint!

Rustom: A bit of Hamsa.

Shri Mataji: The Hamsa is, that’s why I was all the time today putting on to the Hamsa.

Shri Mataji: Hello, how are you?

Bala couldn’t come today?

Rustom: No, I think he has to work.

Shri Mataji: Hmm.

Rustom: But he tends to come now and again.

Shri Mataji: Hmm.

See how Kundalini clears your heads! You can see. It flows down.

Just now, you can see how it is just now so [that] later on you will know. Just see how many bumps here and there. The head is not even.

But as you will grow, you will be amazed how your head will be very even and won’t be any bumps or anything.

The Nabhi also has caught, right Nabhi.

Rustom: Nabhi, Void, Swadishthan.

Shri Mataji: Hmm!

Shri Mataji: Ha! It’s better?

Rustom: Left Swadishthan.

Shri Mataji: Left Swadishthan.

Shri Mataji: Turn around. Turn around.

They are the parasites, I tell you, real parasites!

Yesterday they were all English people, Are they all English?

Yogini: Some are Canadian.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Yogini: Some were Canadian.

Shri Mataji: They are difficult. Canadians have a difficulty.

It’s good, put your hands just to me! He’s got it.

Rustom: Catching the Agnya.

Yogi: How old are you?

Seeker: Sixteen.

Shri Mataji: Pituitary. Left to the Right.

(Mother talks to a small child )

Oh no! What have you got? Where’s mummy? She’s there?

She hasn’t come?

Child: She’s at nanny’s house.

Shri Mataji: She’s at nanny’s house?

Child: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Where’s the little one? She’s with nanny?

Child: Yes.

Shri Mataji: How many Vishuddhi are there? You see? How clear?

See how it clears - the Viraat. You see, the pituitary controls the Viraat.

Yogi: And it’s Krishna who controls the Viraat.

Shri Mataji: With Krishna is the great height, you see. And the pituitary when it is dwarfed, you see, the both combinations are the connection between the two. [It’s] not difficult to me. He is the son, He’s the Father. You see, are his parents Catholic?

Yogi: No

Shri Mataji: Protestant?

Yogi: No.

Shri Mataji: What Church?

Yogi: He doesn’t go to Church.

Shri Mataji: No? Better now? This is the place they come but.

Shri Mataji: Not married as yet? Or they told you not to get married, or something like that?

New Australian yogi: Nothing like that.

Shri Mataji: Nothing like that? Good.

So now you think of your marriage just for a while. Will you? Not of sanyasa.

Ha! You see? It’s better? Hmm!

Another Yogi: I’m still feeling some Void.

Shri Mataji: Void? Void are you feeling? Alright, ask a question you but remove the hands here, alright?

Ask a question looking at my [Agnya?], “Mother, are You the primordial Master?”

Yogi: Mother are you the primordial Master?

Shri Mataji: Again!

Yogi: Mother, are you the primordial Master?

Shri Mataji: Again!

Yogi: Mother, are you the primordial Master?

Shri Mataji: Good!

Another Yogi: It’s cleared.

Shri Mataji: Hmm? It has moved up. Moves from Heart. Heart. It has come up to the Heart.
