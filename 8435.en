Maintaining purity of Sahaja Yoga, 8th of October, 1979

…. has his own way for some time. I said, let him try.

[about the microphone: Is it working or not? Hmm. Ah?
Sahaja Yogi :... It’s just recording, it’s just recording. 
Shri Mataji : Ah, it is not a loudspeaker.
Sahaja Yogi : It’s just a tape
Shri Mataji : Oh, I see
So then  … now this is just … [Sahaja Yogi fixes the mike]
And, he had started, you see, doing some sort of tricks which I did feel about him that he had started doing some tricks about his realization, because that’s the only thing one has to be very careful, that one can get into. And he had gathered spirits, because he got interested in curing too much. I told him not to cure anymore, I said you can give My photograph, but don’t get into curing part, because if you get the spirits you wouldn’t even know and will you be insensitive to it and then you will have problems. And then he had such funny spirits in him that those people who came to him, you see, were influenced to give him money by those spirits. And some people were compelled, I mean they couldn’t help it. The only idea that worked into their heads was that they must give money to him. But this was nothing, he started showing My photograph in the eyes and photographs of Sai Baba in the eyes and all such nonsensical things.
Shri Mataji : [aside] Hello. How are you?
Sahaja Yogi: Fine
Shri Mataji : How is your back?
Sahaja Yogi: My back? I’m thankful I have got.
Shri Mataji : And that’s how he did lots of bad things. So one has to be careful, when you see somebody, this is happening to someone who is gone ahead, be careful about it, because the ego, you see, can betray you. He felt that he was a great Sahaja Yogi and he is doing such a lot of work and he must do lot of curing. Actually your attention should not be too much on curing because if you catch, also you would not know after some time and the whole thing will become-
Shri Mataji : Hello Sudha, how are you? Come forward.
So now we have to be very, very careful as to what we are doing and how we are going to go ahead with Sahaja Yoga.
[aside: Very good!]
We have to keep the purity of Sahaja Yoga – shuchitta. It is called as shuchitta [a sound mind], is the purity of Sahaja Yoga. You must understand Sahaja Yoga in its pure form, and that, now when you have got the yoga, you have to settle down and also purify yourself in relation to Sahaja Yoga. Because so far, you have not felt the Absolute, before getting realization. See, realization is, that you become one with the Absolute. You know the Absolute. Once you know the Absolute then only you can know the relative. Unless and until you know the Absolute you are in confusion, because everything is relative and that’s why nobody knows what is really right and what is not. So you have to have an absolute point, like you have one ‘meter’ in Paris, which is a fixed thing, then when you say it is ten meter, then it is ten times of that meter which is in Paris [from this point is calculated in kilometers, the distance between Paris and other cities]. But because we have not found out our Absolute we are in confusion. And in that confusion anybody can take advantage of it. So the first thing is that we must find out our Absolute and the Absolute is the Spirit. 
Spirit is existing and creating waves without any percussion. For example, if I have to make a sound I have to clap My hand with, one to another, or else you can understand this way, supposing you put a – supposing you throw a stone in the pond, then the waves start rising in the pond. That means the stone has to hit the water to create that pattern of waves, but can you think of some stone which is in the pond without any percussion creating the sound? That’s why it is said that Spirit isnishpanda [motionless], it doesn’t, it doesn’t – we shouldn’t say it doesn’t vibrate, it does vibrate, but doesn’t create this spandana [motion; pulsation], it is not a thing that goes into any percussion, just without any percussion it creates. For example, I am sitting here, you can feel My vibrations, the waves are coming, without any percussion. It just emits. 
In the same way, your Spirit when you feel it, when you touch it through your Kundalini, when it is awakened – it is an awakened thing, but when it is connected with your attention – then your attention receives those waves without percussion which flow in your hands as chaitanya-lahari [waves of chaintanya] as these waves. And because it is coming from the Absolute, you can get a complete answer about the Absolute from this. And on this point so many people have got Realization in it, that you can ask any absolute question and have a realization. That’s why first is Yoga, then kshema. First is the Yoga means the unity or as called in Sanskrit yukti of your attention -is called as jiva- and your Spirit- called as Shiva – these two must meet and unless and until they meet, you cannot reach your Absolute. And once you have felt the Absolute, you can decide all the rest relatively. In Sanskrit it is Akhbar, is Absolute. And there is no paraspara [reciprocal], means there is nothing relative about it. It’s an absolute thing. 
But as you have seen that to know it also, you take time – fully. To be submerged into it, you take time. This growth takes time and that’s why one has to be carefull, not only careful but one has to be alert and one has to work it out. To be absolutely one with it, one has to mature.
 8:11
The maturity-point starts when the germination starts. If you are not even germinated, how will you mature? So the maturity starts after realization, you start also kshema, you get your kshema, means your wellbeing, after Yoga and then you gradually start maturing and once you mature understandingly, properly you have to keep a certain amount of purity, shuchitta – that one has to keep. If you do not keep that shuchitta that purity within yourself and that truth-fullness about it, you won’t progress that fast. I mean it is nobody else’s business, it is your own business, it is for you to do it. If you don’t do it you are the looser. I mean the attitude of all the seekers has to be that of a seeker, that means you are seeking and when you are seeking you are asking for it, you are asking for a gift. Now whatever is to be done for getting that gift one has to do, with full understanding, with full maturity.
Now when the maturity starts also in the beginning some people are quiet confused. If they are able to get out of that confusion then they can establish themselves, but if they cannot and they still remain in the same confusion then they can be, they can be there, they can be lost and they can never get out of it. This confusion has to be fought, has to be faced, has to be seen. Now the confusion comes because of conditionings you have had, lots of conditionings you have had, you have had lots of brainwashing, also you have had physical problems, mental problems and also the atmosphere and all kinds of other things that have spoiled your instrument. But because of Kundalini-awakening your chakras get enlightenment and as, through enlightenment, you can see everything. Now, if there is no enlightenment in this room you just don’t know how to correct it, but when there is enlightenment you start correcting yourself and rising higher and higher. Some people achieve maturity much faster than the others, despite the fact they may have been ruined by many, but still they do it – what does it work?  What makes it very quick? It’s the left-side, what we call as the Mahakalis-Power or we can call it as Iccha-Shakti, the power of desiring. If the power of desiring is very strong and comes from your heart, absolutely from your heart, then it works much faster. So one has to develop an innate feeling from the heart. See, nothing is - nobody else is going to look at you, if you want you can deceive yourself. If you want you can land behind. But only from your heart you have to feel it, that you have to mature into it, you have to come up to it. Once you put your heart to it, everything will work out, because the whole force is coming from your heart, because in the heart resides the Spirit. So only judging-point is :  am I doing it from my heart? Am I doing it superficially? And only thing, that you do from your heart gives you really joy. And when you really do it from your Spirit, then it should give you the greatest happiness and joy and you yourself now, so many of you are receiving the blessings of joy, the blessings of oneness with others, friendship, the pure friendship, pure relationships of just enjoying each other’s Spirit. Not anything else, not the body, not the mind, the intellectual pursues and talking and all that, but cheeriest feeling each other’s Spirit and the fragrance of that.
So nice to see you all again here. [Shri Mataji laughs]
Now, say we have problems of different types for - I think it is more pertaining to the country, and pertaining to the - I would say it’s little localized type, like Bombay-People have their own problems, and Delhi-People have their own problems and most of them have the same style. It’s most surprisingly. And like, we can say people from a village are, particular village in the style of that village is, they have their own problems. So the Mother-soil has also to do something about it. Now in Bombay I would say we have really some very great Sahaja Yogis, very deep people – but so far, the social side has been very poor, in the sense it didn’t spread this way, but very deep and the roots have to go down and there are very few roots that are really required, but branches didn’t spread out. Delhi is another, Delhi are like branches they went round like that and I think London are the fruits I should say or the flowers here, that the way things are, but very vulnerable, very vulnerable, because of being so placed, you see. And so many bees are hovering around. All kinds of problems are there, blessing you of developing immunity to all sorts of surroundings. Now if I exclude you completely from the madding crowd as you call it, then it will happen that you may not develop that immunity which you should have. And if you go too near to these people also you might be affected which you do get affected because there are horrible negative people here. So the best thing would be that first of all, you develop yourself, your Sahaja Yogis together, develop good bonds among yourselves and form a group and then go on enlarging that group, as a whole, and that would be the best way we can all be protected and somehow it is working out that way. I am very happy, you have taken a very sane attitude towards things.
Now talking to other people about Sahaja Yoga and about this method of realization, which is the only method, I find that in the west already people have gone on other lights. To them sex is more important than anything else, to them money is more important than anything else, sort of things are there. So when you talk to them about it, you see, they may recoil on that point. So you have to sit down and develop a brain-trust among yourself, because it’s a very delicate matter how to impress these people. You see, instead of impression you might create depression in their minds. So the best thing is to sit down and discuss among yourselves, because you are one of them and they are one of you. And you know what are their problems, you see, how certain things are suddenly accentuated so much. And the main thing is, the main argument would be: “What’s wrong?” You see, that’s what I’ve faced “What’s wrong? “What goes wrong with it?” Unless and until they come to Kundalini-awakening, they would not know what’s wrong, because then they will see for themselves that the Kundalini is stopped and it wouldn’t rise because of this point and this point. But they won’t come, you see, so how to bring the bull to the fodder, that’s the problem.
Somehow or another you have to sit down, all of you, because now we have mostly Sahaja Yogis and find out ways and methods of how to approach these people when they, you have a discussion among yourselves, because I may not be such a good guide on that point, I think you would be the best to deal with the intellectuals of this country and the leaders of this country and the people who are supposed to be –  models and ideals for the rest of the people.
 
So you can see for yourself what is so impressing about them and how to bring this to their heads, that if you do all these things which you do not see how harmful they could be. But for that, you know, in India what they have done for example as I was talking to you about Rashneesh, three, four Doctors got hold of some of the people who have been to Rashneesh, you see, just because they became little nutty there. They got hold of them and then they examined them thoroughly and then they found out what was the matter and they published a paper about it. See, like that, if you can, because you see they had complete faith in righteousness, in leading a sane life and all that, so they wanted to know whether they were correct or not. When they found out those people and they found out the problems they had, naturally they could write about it. Something like that should be done, I think, to convince people that these methods if you take to, though apparently they do not show any bad results, but inside they create such problems and vacuums and they are so injurious and how ego itself is injurious and how ego is pampered by these things. If you could talk to them in that fashion it would be a good idea. That’s for the Sahaja Yogis. If you have any questions you can ask Me, then We’ll deal with the newcomers who have come down.
 
From the Sahaja Yogis, any questions? I haven’t seen John Donne [?].
Sahaja Yogi : He’s gone to [?]
Shri Mataji : He is still there?
Sahaja Yogi: He’s gone by now.
Shri Mataji : So now, joined it, yes.
So anyone of you has any questions on Sahaja Yoga you ask Me, that’s better. Then I’ll talk to the new people.
So how are you? Better? Anyone seems to be very much better. [Shri Mataji laughs] How are you Lindsay?
Sahaja Yogi: Perfect.
Shri Mataji : [talks in Hindi with a Sahaja Yogini]…
 
Mhm, she has written a poem in Sanskrit.
For your information Rajesh is also getting married now, ah he is marrying a girl from England, she is Chandaria, you might have seen that one. You must have seen him, some of you have seen her. She is a very good girl. So our family is going to increase now in size. So, no questions? Something? Shandor? All in thoughtless awareness? [Shri Mataji laughs]
I mean the name of our Sahaja Yoga is really Maha-Yoga, is the one where you meet, you know. So this is a Maha-Yoga, because the whole thing has been Sahaja only. From the very beginning it is spontaneous, everything, I mean our Nose, Eyes everything has come to us spontaneous, we have done nothing about it. But now the thing where we really meet the Ultimate, that’s the point is called as Maha-Yog’, means the greatest Yoga. Like till I came here, till you didn’t see Me, it was still half way, so Yoga was not there, whatever it was it was not real Yoga, you see, you are making preparations, you are making all the arrangements and everything was there, but when we meet is the Yoga. So the point where you meet is the real place and that’s why it is the Maha-Yoga. Like you, I am coming to London by plane, till Frankfurt I am not in London, till I have landed in London also I am not there because I haven’t yet met you. Till I met you at the gate there was no Yoga, so that’s the point, that’s the movement, the splint of the movement where you meet your Spirit, is the Yoga. So it is actually Maha-Yoga, but in the beginning I didn’t want to call you, call it a Maha-Yoga, because as it is the serpents of ego were there … [Shri Mataji laughs] … with all their complete hood on top of My head so I said, better start it with Sahaja, because if I had said, this is Maha-Yoga they would all come and hit Me hard saying that: Oh God, how can that be? But it is that! And now it is being established that there is something about it, that it is working out because people have seen their Kundalini rising, they have seen the – ah – all the Chakras being awakened and everything with their own eyes and now they believe in it, that they know that there is something about it and that it is happening and there is something about this Lady also, that this is happening, otherwise it is a difficult thing. I mean it is very difficult, no doubt. To raise the Kundalini is very difficult, but it would be something like a very naive person trying to do something, you know, like first putting the hands in the plug, then writing one book that Kundalini means, you get a shock. Then another book that electricity means you get another shock, like that three, four books will come out like that and people would start believing that electricity means that you get a shock, you get a heart-attack, you get – ah – get a, you start jumping with it …. But the one who knows what is electricity is the only one who is a Sahaja Yog. But the one who is – supposing has done all the job of connections and things is the best engineer and for such a person everything is just a play. About certain diseases in this country also I have been able to find out. What We can do is one of them is this [INDIST.] or what you call this arthritis. Is absolutely cure-able, but I was thinking we need not tell them how We do it, because let them come to realization, then we’ll give them. It’s very simple.

SHRI MATAJI: Is there somebody suffering from that? You are? All right, that is because …

YOGI: [INDIST.]

SHRI MATAJI: In your neck?

YOGI: Yes.

SHRI MATAJI: Yes, but still … but still, still – it will work out, in no time. Oh, ah – I can tell you how it is to be done. But ah – that’s, that’s where I may not help you, but all others can. It is because of too much vibrations there, you are getting it. So if somebody, some – any Sahaja Yogi can put the hand – ah - that is you put your hand on his back and on his, this thing and just put your hand outside and it will all, it will be all going out in the atmosphere.

ANOTHER YOGI: Shri Mataji [INDIST.] that?

SHRI MATAJI: The books? The books … [Shri Mataji laughs] You know your Sahaja Yogi-disciple there, your Sahaja Yogi-friends I should say, or your brothers and sisters are ashamed about it. But what to do is see this is our, in our country is getting expert in being in-efficient and they also started some strike in the ports, you see, so the ships were not thanked Bombay, they stopped sending all the ships from Bombay. So most of the ships were coming from Calcutta or from Madras, so I told them you better send all the books to Madras or to Bombay, ah to Calcutta and send them over, but then – you know - it was a very hazardous things to do. Somebody has to go by with the books and all the way in the, they have to go by train and somebody has to put them. So then I told them that what is the maximum time? Then they said, fifteenth of this month a ship is leaving. I said all right, so We can expect it within say a Month time from the fifteenth onward, so the books would be down here very soon. Before that you make all the preparations, send them things for the book. And they said that there is no income-tax for books in England and we were have been unnecessarily worrying about it. So there are, the books are already, all packed up. They wanted to send a load with Me but I said, now who is going to pay for the freight? Because if I had come per Air India I could have brought a big thing, but, you see, I couldn’t come per Air India so also I couldn’t bring the thing, but doesn’t matter, it will be coming in any case. And people have given very great report about the book, it just came out very well and is very, very nicely explained most of the things. But one has to go into details now, somebody is translating it in Marathi and also in Hindi, but We have to go now into Details of many things.

Now in the book still it is not mentioned that this is the last judgment, I don’t know if I have told you all ready that this is the last judgment about which we have been hearing. This is how you are going to be judged and that part We have not yet said in the book, which one has to see. After all, this is how you are going to be judged, what else? [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: Trifle that God] is learning German now somebody, I never received any letter from him neither I, but ah -, some was saying that he got his addresses, brothers address also. You should find out!

But some other books should come out from you people. A smaller book which can be given to people who are not yet realized, or something - would be much better. Who are all the new people who have come today? Can you come forward? Please come! Please come! Come up, come along, come – yes, come forward! Sit down here! Sit down! It’s very simple! Who else? Please come forward, all those who have come for the first time, or who are not yet realized!

SHRI MATAJI: How are you, I am asking. How is he? All right? Ha? All right now? How are you keeping?

YOGI: [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: it depends]

SHRI MATAJI: Hard? Still? Very much better now? Much better – ah? Hmm. Just put your hands straight like this, put your [INDIST.]. Can you take out your socks, it would be better, because we have to earth the, you see we have to use the Mother Earth to take away some of our problems. If you could take out your socks, please? Just put them down on the ground like that, straight! Yeah? Just straight on the ground! Yeah? Just hold your ears, and it will go away. Just … your …
[INDIST.] is his Agnya a little bit, the Agnya is little bit …
Close your eyes, just close your eyes! Just close your eyes! Their Agnya is very strong.
You have come for the first time there? You got your realization? Have you felt your vibrations? Good!
Where is [INDIST.]? She has done lot of good. It will be recorded, this will be good, you see. What they do is to record all the My vibrations and [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: so they record] the lecture of that. So it has a double effect ….

What do you say? He said?

YOGIS: Nabhi, [INDIST.] Right Nabhi! The Nabhi.

SHRI MATAJI: This lady, it’s better? What do you say? Hmm?

YOGI: Right Nabhi! Right Nabhi!

SHRI MATAJI: Right Nabhi, hmm? That’s all?

YOGI: [INDIST.] Vishuddi. [INDIST.]

SHRI MATAJI: Right!

YOGI: [INDIST.]

SHRI MATAJI: All right!

YOGINI: Yes!

SHRI MATAJI: And this one?

YOGINI: Left Vishuddi!

[Yogis take the Maha-Mantras.]

I mean, try this one, is: “Twamewa Sakshat Shri Twamewa Sakshat Shri Maha -, Nirmala Devi.” That’s all! To establish Me as Nirmala Devi is the point. Namoh Namaha!

YOGIS: Om Twamewa Sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi Namaoh Namaha. [they say it three times]

SHRI MATAJI: Say it seven times! All this!

YOGIS: Om Twamewa Sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha. [they say it four times more]

SHRI MATAJI: Ha, just see the vibrations! Let’s see, it’s all right! Feeling the cooler, cool in the hand?

SHRI MATAJI: Feeling it, cool breeze like this. What about you? Not yet? It’s too hot! What about you? You turn on left to the right, you see? You went to some Guru or somebody? No? Did you take to drugs? Never? Hmm?

YOGINI: I didn’t.

YOGI: [INDIST.]

SHRI MATAJI: What’s that?

YOGI: [INDIST.]

SHRI MATAJI: Small thing. All your ordinary secrets. Not that, another style.
She’s got it, here just do this, close your eyes please, I care for it. Hmm?
Put your attention absolutely loose! You are not to do anything, all right? Just leave it alone, just don’t put it on a particular point, just leave it alone! Then it will work out! It has to just go up, so just leave it alone! Close your eyes!

What do you say? Peter? Left to the right!

YOGI: Yes!

SHRI MATAJI: Put it left to the right!

Now, raise the Kundalini! If Hamsa is caught, catching you have to say Pranava or you can say ‘Om Kara’, if you say Pranava or ‘Om Kara’, you see, Om, the Mantra is for that. Let’s try! Just say: “Om Twamewa Sakshat Om Kar’ Sakshat.” Just say that for the Hamsa!

YOGIS: Om Twamewa Sakshat Shri Om Kara Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat Shri Bhagavati Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha. [the Yogis say it twice]

SHRI MATAI: See! See now! [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: The vibrations have started from Me.]
Especially for TM-People.
Hello, Hester come along! May God bless you! You have been very dynamic? [Shri Mataji laughs]

YOGINI: I couldn’t [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: come sooner]

YOGI: [to the collective:] Can you sit down please! Let us correct the centre-heart!

SHRI MATAJI: It is the centre-heart, but his vibrations are coming.
[to a Yogi:] Little bit hold your breath! Little bit hold your breath please! You must have done some pranayama, have you done some pranayama, hmm? The breathing-exercise?

SHRI MATAJI: Now you are all right, isn’t it? You are all right, I think, [INDIST.]
Better! You are this. Hamsa is a problem. You did Pranayama, isn’t it?

YOGI: [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: Now I does and that’s why I really did come to this program.]

SHRI MATAJI: Hmm?

YOGI: [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: That’s the reason why I did come to this program.]

SHRI MATAJI: Here? All right, that’s why … It’s very bad here, still. But you are all right otherwise? You feel all right? What sort of meditation you did? What was the name?

YOGI: [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: I have to say, I am selling books and – ah – in the first moment, Shri Mataji, I cannot.]

SHRI MATAJI: Oh! [Shri Mataji works on the Yogi]
Now, better? I think, keep your eyes open might help. That’s it, that’s Sahaja Yoga really does that job. You did it for many years? And there was no picture, nothing? [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: On your own need it] just like that. This [INDIST. SOUNDS LIKE: Rombard]-Fellow, is it? [INDIST.]

YOGI: [INDIST.]

SHRI MATAJI: But who bought you this, this – ah – Pradak? Who told you about this style, who was the man?

YOGI: I read a book, some book of [INDIST.].

SHRI MATAJI: What does he say? That’s why you get this wobbling. What is there, Marcus, how is he? They are all in meditation, all right. Ah?

ANOTHER YOGI: It is Nabhi, left Nabhi.

SHRI MATAJI: Wobbling? In the head?

YOGI: [INDIST.]

SHRI MATAJI: The whole thing gets upset with this concentration …

[aside:] Patricia come! Come! We try! [INDIST.] …

This is why you were getting all this trouble.
Better now, is he settled down? Ah? Better? Some Patterns I have to teach you also … but you have to make it. Better now?

YOGI: A little. Nabhi.

SHERI MATAJI: Ha?

YOGI: What I feel is left Nabhi.

SHRI MATAJI: Left … better?
[aside:] Just it takes away the energy.
Now better? Hmm, better now! Much better! That’s why you met with an accident, you know? Because of this done by left [INDIST.]. Hhm?

ANOTHER YOGI: Also left Vishuddi!

SHRI MATAJI: Yeah! It is left, you know that.
[aside:] That is very bad.
Better now?

SHRI MATAJI: But it may be against their principles, you see. Yesterday they were talking in a, now what they are doing? Nothing but offering food, how do eat the food, how to mix the food and all this nonsense, isn’t it? Where is Sahaja Yoga, and where is all these going on? So if I tell them, now all this is not going to give you anywhere, they might be shocked. I can go and talk to them in any case, let’s see. They wouldn’t beat you anyway. [Yogis laugh] Because this is going too far, [INDIST.]. I washed it a little bit and he was amazed, you see. One brought a bowl and talked of a sort of a protocol and he sat before the person, repelled his name and did go to the other fellow who did very seriously. [Yogis laugh] Yes! There he mixed up something, then they made six bowls out of it … Isn’t it? All this goes on!

Let’s ask one sentence. Now ask the question: Mother, are you the Himalaya?

YOGINI: [INDIST.]

SHRI MATAJI: You are? You keep aloof. Hmm! This also can work out. If you keep aloof before realization …

YOGI: You keep aloof!

SHRI MATAJI: Aloof. Someone says, ah! You see? Before realization - Nirvichara. They have to become this…

YOGI: Ah I see, Shri Mataji, otherwise it is just …

SHRI MATAJI: It is artificial. You see upon?

YOGI: So that’s why the Vishuddi catches. She is too much involved in that play.

SHRI MATAJI: You see, she is not yet a Sakshi. Did you? You should be … That is just like taking a Sanyasi, this is artificial. This should happen to you, isn’t it? Aloofness should happen to you. You should not act as if you are aloof. You are not! Ha! You see? It’s better now? You are not? Now let’s see!

YOGINI: [INDIST.]

SHRI MATAJI: You got it stitched there – or?

YOGI: [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: No, the problem is the fat, and all of them, they don’t know him …]

SHRI MATAJI: Now I don’t know. It is the same.

YOGI: They don’t want [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: the oil].
