Diwali Puja. Montecatini Terme (Italy), 29 October 1989.

Yesterday was such a nice time we had together, and we really enjoyed Diwali, I think. I’ve never seen such a joyous ocean, absolutely going in a tempest. We have achieved the purpose of Diwali Puja, I think, only yesterday: it’s to feel the joy of God’s love. But diwali word is from deepa wali means the rows of lights. It was celebrated firstly because thousands of years back Shri Rama was crowned on this day. That means the benevolence of human beings was crowned, was accepted. And in Shri Rama’s life you see an ideal personality being shown to be a king, to be the benevolent king as described by Socrates. So this was a great joyous thing that a benevolent king was crowned. That means we have to have a king who is benevolent. That’s only possible if the people who choose the king have no other consideration but that of benevolence of all the people. So one has to come to the conclusion that they have to be Sahaja yogis, because other think that, “How much money we’ll get out of this power that we’ll have.”  Some think, “How much power-oriented we could be.” Some think, “How many countries I can win,” or any other domination. 

So we’ve got two types of theories: as we see, is one is communism and another is democracy, where one is power-oriented, the another is money-oriented, and in both the cases we say that it’s all failed. And it’s a good news for all of you to know that Russia which was a country known to be run in complete fear has turned out to be the best for Sahaja Yoga. It is one of the super powers. When the government is like that I think the people are better. They do not have these false notions of individual freedom. They do not think that, “Ah, what’s wrong?” I told them, “You must put oil on in your head because you’ll become bald.” Next day all of them were down [without, with the oil], [nothing doing/ rubbing it in]. So the kind of obedience they had from very beginning of their country. that sense of obedience is so great. You tell them anything, immediately they do it. Not one, thousands. One thousand were sitting in the hall; two thousand were outside waiting for Me, on a follow-on. Imagine how wise and deep they are, while in the West we are lost in our so-called freedom idea of so-called freedom: “What’s wrong?” But actually we are slaves if you see. Any fashion that starts, everybody starts doing it. But why? Why do we follow those fashions? We must see how we are slaves. Because others will laugh at us if we don’t do like that. They’ll make fun of us. Because they will criticize us. So because they have got a freedom to criticize we are frightened of such people who can criticize. And now the criticizing people are criticizing them. Critics have critics, their critics are their another critics, and there are critics after critics. So only the critics are produced. Where is the benevolence? There’s no question of benevolence at all. 

So in the freedom-loving people who are supposed to be free, the idea of benevolence is finished. Because whatever good for you, whatever is benevolent for you, can be only understood if you have wisdom, if you have depth. But if you have this kind of freedom is to go amuck, do what you like. Because everybody’s doing it, I must do it. Everybody is singing like this; so I must do it. But from where does this idea come in? From where these ideas come in? Are they entrepreneurs who want to befool you, make slaves out of you? And this slavery is so-called freedom for you, but actually I think it’s complete slavery because you do what they tell you, behave in the same manner as whatever they say. There are no fashions in that country. Very few, very few women indulge into fashions. Nothing. And men are also very simple. They have no fashionable things. They have only things which are convenient, good for their climate. That’s what they wear, whether you laugh or don’t laugh. It’s everybody laughs here. If anybody laughs at them they’ll say, “[This is/They’re] stupid.” They’ll all have pity for him, that’s all. 

So one has to understand that it was the king, Rama, who was made the, actually accepted by the public, like [a/the] crown was put on his head to say that benevolence is the highest thing. And whatever is benevolent for us should be accepted in our freedom if we are really a free country. But if we are not free inside, we are bound by what people will say; they’ll criticize us. Do you know as a result of that there is no art in this country? But I saw lot of art growing in Russia. Because any art you produce is criticized. So people have to be careful, this not be so much, little this, little that. Nobody can produce any art there. Any musician is there is criticized in these countries. There if you go, the musicians are tremendous musicians. They have of a very high quality musicians there, very high quality of dramatist, not at all boring as they are here. If you go any play in England it’s so boring that you feel like running away from there, extremely boring. There was a play, we went to see, it was called [a, as] Star Express or Express Star or something. There was nothing, except on the wheels they were moving round as ghar-ghar, ghar-ghar. Nothing there. So anybody would go mad with it, I tell you. We were there hardly for fifteen minutes, came out with a headache. We didn’t know where to go. 

So with this kind of criticism that we have, it’s only freedom we have is to criticize other, make fun of others, react to others. How can you enjoy? To enjoy others first of all you must accept the goodness of other people, not mentally, from your heart. And that will bring the benevolence on this country of ours which we call the Kingdom of God. 

Then there is, the second day is where Narakasura was killed.  Now Narakasura was the one who was the devil from the hell, let’s say ? very cunning, very clever ? and he was killed by the Goddess. Actually he was killed by a, another incarnation, Kartikeya, but Goddess gave Him the power to kill. So when he was killed it was celebrated because the evil was killed. But we don’t find that these days the evil people are getting peace awards. So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted brain? How is it they are using perversion? Just the opposite of it. What has worked out these things? So again we find the same so-called freedom to become also evil. So we have freedom to become evil. First of all we have freedom not to be benevolent, and secondly to become evil we have freedom. 

So the Narakasura within us must be killed, the one which teaches us evil, to do evil to others. If you are busy doing evil to others you can never enjoy. Because you enjoy doing evil to others. So that has to be faced within ourselves, not in other people. It’s very easy to say that this Sahaja yogi is caught up, that Sahaja yogi is like that, but very difficult to say, “Mother, I am caught up. I have got this problem within myself.” So when you start seeing yourself your heart opens out. Unless and until you learn how to open out your heart how can you enjoy? Open your heart. 

Many people live on very superficial level. All right, some of them might say that, “I am possessed, Mother. I’ve got this possession.” Why? “I’ve got this conditioning, that conditioning.” But why? You don’t want to enjoy. So watch yourself, see for yourself. This is my conditioning, “All right, I’ll put you right.” See in the mirror. Tell yourself, “This kind of a useless conditioning I’ve got it from where? Because I’m Indian, because I’m French, because of English.”  Open the heart. And opening the heart is only possible if Narakasura sitting on your heart is killed, finished, once for all. 

In small, small things there is joy. In very little things also there’s a ripple of joy. If you are sensitive you can catch it. And why not enjoy? Why to have these stupid conditioning on our heads for nothing at all that we can’t enjoy? Enjoyment is only possible if you take out this one, sitting on your heart. 

So that is the second part of the Diwali that you have to open your heart. Forget your nationality, forget your race, forget everything. It’s a funny kind of things Sahaja yogis have. They must be respected, they must be treated like this or maybe that we are something great and they are no good. If you cannot mix up with the collective it’s something wrong with you. Nothing wrong with others. Easy to find faults with others. But what’s the use? If you start finding faults with others you do not become clean. Supposing I find that your clothes are not clean. My, My clothes are not going to get clean by that, are they? It’s so practical and simple it is that we should see ourselves, what’s wrong with us, and improve ourselves so that we can really, really, from our heart, enjoy. 

Third one is a very beautiful thing is the Lakshmi Puja, means the day they worship Lakshmi. I’ve told you many a times, the symbol of Lakshmi was created really beautifully. And it was so that She came out of the water. Through the water She came out so clean. And She has no pride. She doesn’t assert Herself. She doesn’t put Her pressure on others. But human beings are just the opposite. If they have money they ride on a horse all the time. They cannot come down. It’s impossible to talk to them. 

So a person who has money is not the one who is worshipping Lakshmi, who is not a Lakshmi pati as called him, the owner of the Lakshmi. Because She stands only on a lotus. Can you imagine how light She must be to stand on a lotus? She has a big body, everything is there, but She stands on a lotus. That She takes all Her weight within Herself, She just sucks in Her weight as Shri Krishna has described. That like a tortoise sucks in his legs inside his body, in the same way we have to suck in all the weight of money, weight of your positions, weight of your so-called education, weight of some aristocratic family you are born of. This is all nonsense which makes you a heavy person to go down very fast. 

So She stands, or floats in a way, on the lotus. And what a thing is beautiful, this lotus, that She doesn’t disturb any petals of the lotus, nothing. She just stands, peacefully, in a balance. Unless and until you have balance you cannot stand on a lotus. So She is so balanced. Her center of gravity is so balanced that She cannot topple down. Then in Sahaja Yoga, some people, you ask them, “How are you?” Ten years have passed, sometimes like this also. Why? Because you must be grounded in the Mother Earth, into the practical side of it. It’s nothing, something, we are hanging in the air, but we are grounded in the Mother Earth. And the slightest thing happens to us, again we come back to our balance. So this is Her position when She stands up in the lotus. 

Now She has a hand, one hand like this, one hand like this, and there are two hands which have got again the lotuses, the pink ones. Yesterday you saw the pink. Pink is Her fragrance I think is spread on the sky. And She is pink, pink because that shows that Her house, Her nature is pink. Pink is inviting, is loving. She is a very fond hostess, that She wants everybody to come in, in Her house. But if you see a rich man, he’ll have ten dogs outside and nobody can come inside the house. Only the dogs and he lives. He can’t lives with human beings. So the house is closed, the doors are closed, everything closed. Money is closed permanently. So, such a person cannot be called as Lakshmi pati, he’s not a Lakshmi pati. Because he must have a cozy, beautiful, cozy, again I say, cozy house. Cozy doesn’t mean like a hospital. Anything drops, you feel frightened. “Oh, my God.” Then you’ll pick it up. Cozy means where you are comfortable. It’s all right, in the house, in the home if somebody comes and stays then it’s little bit here and there and then doesn’t matter that you put it right. But that doesn’t mean the lousy house also. It should not be taken as a lousy house, but a house which is inviting. When people come in, you give them a place to sit down and make them enjoy. It’s not done, in India at least.  I don’t know, so far we are now quite getting westernized, that anybody drops something on the carpet we’ll never clean it in their presence because it’s very bad manners. Carpet is not important than the guest, is it? Or if we break something, say, a glass, then we say, “Very good. It’s something has gone out. Some bad thing has gone out.” Or a thermometer is broken we say the same thing. 

All these things happen in a way just to see how far we are open-hearted or to suggest to you that something is going wrong. If something falls off just see what’s going on in your brain. What are you thinking? Is there something funny you are thinking about somebody or something wrong you are thinking? Then it’s [something, start, up to you]. Otherwise everything it’s nice and smooth. So, another conditioning we have, which is a very, very funny conditioning, either we’ll have the lousiest of lousiest houses or we’ll have houses which will just look like hospitals. Even a rat could not enter there, leave alone human beings. They’ll polish all the brass, they’ll polish everything. Husband, wife will fight on that. They’ll have divorces for it. But not even a rat will enter that house. I have seen many houses like that. And I’ve seen the other way round also: those that are lousiest, where there’s no garden, there are no flowers, nothing beautiful. So, we have to be, not to this extreme or that extreme, but something that will give joy to others, to visitors, to people who come to your house. You’ll soothe the sick. People should feel happy to come to your house. So there’s no showing off. Not to show off but to make them comfortable and very happy.  You can do lots of things, very interesting things, if you have the Lakshmi principle in you. 

I’ve met once a Chinese gentleman. He had a very beautiful house, everything, and he was so interesting. He had made the house very interestingly, very nice, very beautiful.  And you didn’t feel any aggression at all in that house. So I saw his dining room done with very good, beautiful, green marble and white lights. I said, “Must be quite expensive.” “No, that’s the beauty. It’s very cheap. You know how I did it cheaply.” All the time he was telling Me how he did things cheaply, means he has never shown off it’s expensive. But a person who’s aggressive will say, “Oh, you know, this one I got it for so much, so much, so much.” But a person who wants to give you joy, he’ll say, “No, I tell you it’s so cheap, you won’t believe, for a [sum/song].” That’s the sign of a person who wants to give joy to his guests. He’ll never try to say that it’s very expensive, “I spent so much money, this is so, this that.” This is showing off. And then ultimately you say, “It’s very good,” three times; then it’s yours. “Have it.” Of course he can’t give you the floor. The rest of it you can take. That’s, that’s what it is a personality which is joy-giving.  

Like a lotus, as I have told you before also, a beetle comes, a black beetle with horrible thorny legs, and enters into this lotus for [the] sleeping in the night, you see. And the lotus closes down its coziness on it and sleeps very comfortably, and then next day it opens out. So it flies out. That’s how your homes, your ashrams, your hearts should be. Beautiful, so that anybody can feel that soothing and that comforting feeling, when they are in your company. But not a person who was reactionary. Like you go to somebody’s house and immediately say, “I don’t like this carpet.” This is, it’s bad manners, absolute bad manners to say like that. To say that, “I don’t like it,” it’s bad manners for Sahaja Yoga. 

Any music you hear, supposing there is a musician who could be of a very high level, could be of a very ordinary level, you should be able to enjoy everything. Otherwise you are not a Sahaja yogi. If you are going to criticize a musician that, “Oh, God, what a musician. He’s no good,” this, that, then he’s not going to improve. But if you encourage the musician, “Oh, you are very good. You are very great,” he’ll play much better next time; you’ll see that. There’s no falsehood about it. Some people think it’s not honest. But this kind of useless, absolutely fatal kind of honesty is not wanted in Sahaja Yoga. You be honest to yourself. And there’s no need to tell anybody your opinion very honestly. Keep it to yourself, all these honest opinions, and direct towards yourself. 

Like you see somebody. Now, honestly you want to tell him that he is wearing a funny dress, honestly. You better look at yourself, what sort of a dress you are wearing, and what business you have got to tell him that he’s wearing funny. On the contrary, you say, “This is very nice. I like it. It’s very nice. It’s good, good. Nice one.” They’ll say, “No, but.” He’ll say that, “No, not so good. Yours is nice.” “Oh, you can get this very cheaply, you see, very cheaply. I’ll tell you from where. And you can have it if you like. I can take yours. You take mine.” So the basic, subtle point is that, that with your love, you are encouraging everyone, you are helping everyone, you are creating a confidence in him, his personality and a kind of a rapport which is very subtle. 

So, a lotus is born in the pond, which is so dirty, filthy, full of worms, everything, like as we see the world is today. But the lotus covers with his fragrance the whole of that pond and covers it up completely and you forget the thing what is behind.  It has very big, big leaves, very big leaves, you see, like the ears of the elephant. And that covers the whole thing. So you don’t see any filth or dirt. What you see is beautiful, clean, big leaves. Sometimes they are like a tali, like a big tali that we use for eating. And then all these things are covered with you. There’s no honesty about it. They could say, “Why should we honest, let such say all the worms and the filth growing about?” But the honesty lies in honestly understanding what is your job as Sahaja yogi is. You are not there to point out the bad points but you are there to cover all the bad points, all the loopholes, with your love. That’s your job, and there you have to be honest. 

Sense of honesty, the way it is accepted these days, it has created only cheats and thugs and thieves. Even a thief can be won over. You can. I’ll give you an example. I met one boy in Delhi market. Poor thing, he was all wounded, he was suffering so I brought him in the car home. So in the family, My brother and My husband both got very worried. He said, “Who is this brother-in-law you have brought it?” I said, “He is My [neighbor, nephew]. All right, let it be. Doesn’t matter. Whatever you say I’ll keep him.” So I looked after him. I treated him. He got all right. These two persons got after him. We could send him to the police, send him to the police, this. I said, “[Try].  Now, let us see, he’s a good man. He’ll be all right.” “No, send him to the police.” Might have been, I don’t know, might have been. And they were after his life; till ten days he was all right [I soothed them/him down]. After tenth day, he was so fed up with these two persons, he ran away. And he ran away, and he ran away with what, do you know? He ran away with all the things that belonged to My brother and My husband. And he left My necklaces, My watches, everything nicely. He didn’t touch that; he didn’t touch that. 

Hello, see when I am talking, don’t talk to each other. This is a new Sahaja yogi? Tell him not to talk. When I’m talking don’t talk. That’s not the way. 

So he just ran away. And imagine, he left – I had a necklace, a very nice, beautiful, expensive necklace, I should say, given by My mother – he didn’t touch it. He didn’t touch anything and he took away whatever was possible from their purse, from their things, whatever were left, everything he took away. “Now,” I said, “now go to the police.” Fine. What? So, this is how one has to know that the honesty is for yourself, not for others. Don’t try to be honest with others. Be honest to yourself. Keep that honesty to yourself because maybe is rational and maybe that it is just a matter of habit that you are trying to hurt others. So first check on your mind and find out if you are trying to hurt others or you are trying to please others.  Otherwise don’t talk; just keep quiet. If you are going to say something to please others, talk; otherwise just don’t talk. And you’ll be surprised, when you say nice things to others, how niceness comes to you. 

Like supposing somebody comes and tells Me that, “Mother, he is very bad. He has troubled me so much, this thing, that thing. I don’t like him,” so I tell him, “No, no, he was praising you a lot.” It’s, it’s not honest, but I tell him, “He was praising you. He was so much in love with you. He’s so kind to you. He was telling Me he loves you very much.” He said,  “Really?” “Yeah, he did say.” Next day you find them going together. So in Sahaja Yoga, once you come in there’s very little, is left out, very little here and there. And some of them are really very superficial but most of you have very little things left here and there. And only if you can watch that part you can throw it away and you can really become very joyous people. 

Now there are some people who never smile, who never laugh. So then you are allowed to tickle them. It’s absurd. It’s said that you have to be like children; you have to be like children. You play with something, finished; then you play with another, finished. You don’t get involved into anything. You don’t get attached to anything. Unless and until you [are/have] that child-like heart you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga. It’s useless. You will be here for years together; you will be useless, absolutely. Specially if you are coming from false gurus, it’s very difficult. Because what I have known of false gurus, they never laugh, never smile. They are very serious. Only take your money, keep on the backside. So it is important that we should be in a very joyous mood, alert, aware, enjoying every bit of it. That’s one of the Lakshmi’s principles is. 

Now another thing is that, the suggestion is of the left hand is like this, means She is giving. A person who has money, must give. Not to the Pope, I never mean that. But must give to somebody who needs it. But so secretly that this hand should not know, is so far away, this one.   This hand should give, just secretly. Sometimes it’s difficult to give money to anyone. I find it difficult, because I find it that people will not like it. So there is a way of giving. There are so sweet ways of giving. Just try to notice what that person likes. 

Sometimes even children understand. Like I know, of My granddaughter. She said, “This boy, Nani, doesn’t even have any good chappels. I feel so bad about it. But how to give him? He will not take money from me.” So I said “You do one thing. You go and do something to his chappel.” So she went and little bit spoilt his chappels more, you see. When they were walking together it broke. So she said, “Ah, see now, the chappels are broken.” She took him to a chappel shop and bought him a chappel. He said, “But I have no money.” “No, just take it. Just take it. It’s all right,” [she said/ It’s]. Just, I’ll be very happy you take.” That’s how. It’s so sweet to hear and to do it. How beautiful it must be. We like to hear everything. We want to see in a film everything good, in a television. But when it comes to us we are different. 

When we see a mother-in-law torturing her daughter-in-law you always say, “Oh, look at her, how cruel she is.” But we don’t want to see we are the same. So cruelty is out of question in Sahaja Yoga. Out of question. Nobody has to be cruel to anyone. Nobody has right to be cruel. Whether they are leaders or non-leaders or anything they are, you have no business anyway to be cruel to anyone, hurting anyone. We are not daggers. We are lotuses. Ha, if you have to hit somebody, hit with a lotus. It’s such a delicate thing. But it can be only understood if you go deep into it, into Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise it cannot be understood. Now, a saint is a saint. He cannot become cruel, cannot. There’s no need. What is the need to be cruel? 

So then with one hand there should be [dhan], means giving. Giving in a way that is secret. There’s no need to give Me anything. I’ve been telling you, “Don’t give Me anything.” I don’t want to take anything. If you give Me anything, gold and silver, I’ll leave it here. I cannot take it. The reason is not that, I mean, I don’t appreciate, that you are loving Me, this thing. But a flower is sufficient for Me. But a person who needs something you must give. I’m so self-contained ? you know that very well ? that I can live anywhere, I can live on the street, I can live anywhere, I have no problem, I can do without food, no problem. All right, in adoration you want to give Me something, but I’ve been telling that, “Don’t give Me. If you give Me anything expensive, I’ll leave it here. I will not take it.” And we have now passed a law or regulation, everything, but I hope you’ll listen to Me. So what is needed is the thing that we should know what is the dearth of another person. What will he need? You need silver for Puja, all right. I’ll give you silver, all right. But in such a sweet manner that you don’t feel that Mother is giving us [unclear]. So there should be a feeling of giving at the right time, at the best opportune moment, to give something. That is also one thing, just like a cameraman knows when to click. In the same way you must know when to click when giving is concerned. On odd times if you give it must be a very hurting thing. A person can feel very hurt if you give at the odd time to someone something. We have so many stories of that kind, like Sudama’s is that thing when he…[missing part] 

But here you should know you are the one who has to solve the problem. It is your problem. The world is your problem. Why were you born at this time? Why did you get your realization and why are you Sahaja yogis? Just for name’s sake? So in every field you have to take a responsibility to see what you can do. Supposing you are an architect, have designs made, create designs. Just try. I’ll help you. You are a musician? Then take up ways and methods of spreading good music. If you are writer then write something interesting, not boring, something interesting, something which will elevate people. If you are a government servant, all right, try to show that you are acting for the government that is of a much higher level. And such a person will be respected, very much respected. Everybody’s personality will grow, not that you run away from somewhere because most of the people say that, “Mother, we get caught up,” this, that, you know. It depends on. I told you that I have to sometimes shake hands with six hundred people who are sometimes absolutely drunk. So it’s all right; that’s My job. So we are not going to run away. We are covered with the protection of the spirituality. If you can keep to the central path of Sushumna nobody can touch you. 

So out of the Lakshmi principle I hope you get all the tatwas, all the principles, satisfied in you fully, and also the Mahalakshmi principle flows through your being. You have to be very satisfied and comfortable people. Not to find faults. If you are finding faults then know that you are not Sahaja yogis. If you are trying to control others then know that you are not Sahaja yogis. Even the leaders, I would say, should never try to control. They must know how the principle is working in the silence; see for themselves how it is working. It’s a trick you must learn. Of course, little correction is needed. That time you correct the person. At that time, doesn’t matter. But you must know how the whole principle of benevolence is working itself. The whole Paramachaitanya is doing the benevolence part; you must know that. As I’ve told you before also, you have to be like the sea which receives all the rivers into it. If you are on top of the hill you cannot receive anything. So you have to be like a sea to receive everything and you have to be at the height. As I told you the other day, the same way that very close to the sea there should be a personality which is above everything else. Such a beautiful personality you should have, is the depth of the sea and the height of the Kailas. May God bless you all. 

[missing part] such an idea[s] which is all self-destructive, believe Me. You look funny with it. [All right/ Right]? Little oil, do it properly, make it properly, comb[ing, it]. We are not hippies. This thing started with the hippyism. Now hippy is finished. Now a new thing has started, yuppies, where they put oil, nicely do groom their hair. I don’t want you to be yuppies either, but you should look proper, because what I feel that you don’t look after your Sahasrara. And if you have hair like that you look like a bhoot, to be very frank, according to Indian standard. And the bhoots go into you because they think there is some bhoot going, to be very frank. All right, so please put little oil. Everyday, little oil, please put. You can put some water, wash it and little do it, and then clean it off, in the morning [time] so that you won’t have any problem. Have you seen Debu Choudhry? See his hair. He’s such a grown-up, matured man. His hair are so good. Or you want to have bald heads? [Aside: I’m entrusting him and.]

Sahaja yogi: She’s very new, Ma. 

Shri Mataji: Ha, I saw her, I saw her. 

[missing part maybe] Sir C.P.: May I wish all of you a very happy Diwali. What a beautiful Diwali this is. Diwali is a festival when we gather together as a family. It’s a family function. And to belong to this family I think this is the biggest privilege that anyone can aspire to. And therefore, Mr. Guido, [I’m] very grateful to you and to all the Sahaja yogis and Sahaja yoginis for the honor they bestowed upon me by accepting me here this evening and by giving me a chance to be here with you. I don’t know how to describe this lovely evening today, what we have just seen. I have been overtaken and overwhelmed by emotion. I look back on many, many years and I cannot recall any other Diwali which has been as joyous and as full of happiness as this one. And when I see all of you here today that I’ve said on earlier occasions I feel as if I am transported to another world, a different world, a new world, a beautiful world. So, to this very happy family that is gathered here I wish a very happy Diwali and a very happy and prosperous New Year. Now you may perhaps believe that New Year begins on the first of January, but New Year also begins now after Diwali, and therefore we all wish each other a happy and prosperous New Year. 

This is an occasion when I should like also to thank you very much for all the kindnesses you have always showered upon me. I am now due to retire very soon from my present assignment as the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization. I’ve been looking forward to it greatly. And some people think that when they retire, my God, how are they going to face the world? I am trustily looking forward to the day when I hand over these responsibilities and assume new ones which perhaps She may be able to give me. 

You have known the Creator of this world, very intimately; you love Her as She loves you. I have also had the great privilege of knowing Her, perhaps a little longer than you have known. I knew of Her first when She was the beloved daughter of Her father, the favorite child. I knew Her when we were about to get engaged, the quiet and maiden that She was. I knew Her when we got engaged, I knew Her as a bride when we were married and She had to take the oath She was a, you know, a young lady quiet, maiden, shy as She is even today. I have, I have known Her as a wife, I can assure you the most dutiful wife ever apart being the most beautiful. I have known Her as the mother of my children and I have known Her as the grandmother of my grandchildren. And I have known Her as your Mother. She has many, many rup as we call it.  But you have seen Her in Her swarup, which is the ultimate. 

To me when people say, “What is a miracle? How, where, does one see a miracle?” I see a miracle sitting here, right in front of me. Each one of you is a miracle. What you are today, your face, your angelic face, your goodness, your happiness, inner bliss, this is a marvelous transformation with the world needs. But you have got it, and isn’t this a miracle? A human being is the most difficult creation of the Almighty, the best, the highest and yet the most difficult. To be able to create one angel is God own work and to create so many of you is Her work. I want this beautiful [world / work] to grow because the world needs it. The world is desperately in need of this beautiful, new creation. The world is changing. As you know, the world is changing for the better. And recently Her trips abroad, particularly to Soviet Union, have shown that East or West, North or South, they are all ready to receive Her, to receive Her message and to begin a big change, a process of change. I wish that Her dream comes true in an ever increasing measure. I wish you the very best and [maybe missing part] success to you, all of you and your children here, and I hope I shall have the honor and privilege of not serving, probably serving, yes, Sahaja Yoga in some way or another, as I said, in accordance with Her wishes. Thank you and may God bless you. Thank you very much. 

Shri Mataji: This is just to wish you very, very Happy Diwali. To us Diwali is that from one light we enlighten many lights. This is the Diwali we are celebrating here today that we have so many people who are enlightened. We can see on their face their Self-realization shining. I won’t take much time because children will go off to sleep and they are going to show us some nice program and we have to give them presents. And after that we give presents to everyone today. It’s My desire that today I should be able to give presents to all of you. And once the presents have been given, after that we’ll have nice music program. 

May God bless you. Thank you.
