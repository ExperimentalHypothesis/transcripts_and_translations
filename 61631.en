The best would be, that they all could sit on this side.

So, we are all here on this beautiful seashore to enjoy such a nice(ly) meeting, specially  with the children of Rome. They are wearing such beautiful flowers on their Sahasrara.  They are already celebrating their Sahasrara Day. It is important for us to keep our  Sahasrara open for tomorrow. And not to close it today. We have to understand that we are  special people and that we have got our self-realization. I have got a photograph of yours,  all of you sitting with all your Kundalini giving light on top of your heads. Each one has  that. It is really remarkable, how it is showing so clearly the light on top of your heads,  giving you a certificate that you are all enlightened people. You have to believe in yourself  – that is the main point. Now here you have children; they are all realized souls, you can  see from their faces. They are so beautiful.

As they are so innocent and realized, they have so much of sensitivity. That’s why Christ  has said: You have to become like children, if you want to enter into the Kingdom of God;  meaning we have to be innocent.

Innocence is something you cannot force into; it’s a state, it’s a state of mind, it’s a state of  a person. When you feel innocent, you know you are innocent and you enjoy your  innocence.

I find that people think by being cruel, by being harsh on others or by being subservient to  others, you achieve something. Yes, you do achieve, but whatever you achieve is  temporary, is for the time being – nothing of eternal nature you can achieve unless and  until you have entered into the Kingdom of God; and for that you have to be like children  or you have to be children. It’s such a great quality among children that they don’t know  what falsehood is. They don’t tell lies, till we teach them to tell lies. They are born with so  many qualities of righteousness. And if they are realized souls, they are remarkably good. I had an idea to write a book about what the realized children talk about others; so interesting and so beautiful, so remarkable, so convincing.

In our effort of Sahaja Yoga, is our Sahasrara that helps us. And Sahasrara’s Brahmarandra the central point here – is your Heart Chakra. It rules the Heart Chakra. That means that  your heart has to be open, like a child’s heart; like a beautiful lotus, it has to be open.

If you have a closed heart, conditioning or some sort of a false idea about yourself, then  you suffer, and then you suffer very much; suffer in Sahaja Yoga, make others suffer, and  sometimes with such a heart, you cannot gain the real knowledge, the absolute knowledge.  So don’t be worried that, if I open my heart, that something will be dangerous or people  will misunderstand me, that I should talk artificially to people, so that I am not exposed. We have to expose ourselves completely. There is nothing to fear. Heart is beautiful – it’s the  lotus, which has the diamond of your spirit with it. Unless and until you open your heart,  how will this diamond shine? How will your face get this beautiful countenance? How will  people see that you are realized souls?

So, one has to open the heart. Open the heart – it’s so nice to see the children. As soon as  you see the children, the heart opens. Because you are not afraid of them. You are not worried about them. You do not have to take artificiality. You are so natural with children.  You behave so naturally with them. So, very important for us, that without any fear, without any conditioning, without any ego, if you have to exist, just fearlessly open your heart.  Whatever you have to say or think, just say it out. You will be surprised, if your heart is  open, maybe sometimes you might feel that you have said something which you should not  have said, maybe. But don’t feel guilty. Next time you will do better. And that is how we  have to see, this beautiful thing today that they are going to show us. I don’t know what to  say. It’s already started the quarrelling now, better start the program now.
