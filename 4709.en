Public Program, "The Experience of Truth".  South Bank Polytechnic, London (England),  22 June 1984.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. There are in these modern times, many seekers of truth. It’s a special category of people born in these modern times. Perhaps we are not aware that in every country, a lot of people are born with this seeking. They are a special category which, sees beyond, tries to find something beyond, what they can perceive through their sense organs. The truth as we see, is through our sense organs. For example something we see as white, we call it white, something we feel cool, we call it cold, something as hot, means whatever we perceive through our sense organs and whatever is communicated to us through our central nervous system we accept as truth, and we should accept that only, as truth. And not something that is told to us, not something that we have read in the books, not something that we can project our mind to, and then .......................that does not mean that I deny any one of the scriptures. That does not mean that I deny anything that we have known so far. But to begin with let us start from scratch as they call it or a clean slate. Let us see what is the truth.

Now in every religion truth has been described. As I can see it, everybody does not see it themselves.....................That’s why there’s blindness, that’s why there are these blind alleys where you end up, arguing things. So there must be something that is missing within us, that we have not been able to really relate truth to our central nervous system. And what is that missing within us, we should find out. In all humility we should know that there must be something within us, that we have been arguing about so many things, we have been talking about so many things, reading so many books, going into all kinds of funny experiences, right from alcohol to other drugs and Gurus and this and that, but still we have not felt anything on our central nervous system.

Secondly that we have no control over that truth. So, so what is the reason? Is it there is something missing in the human awareness? Is it that we are lacking something in our human awareness? All the books, all the scriptures, which are true scriptures have said one thing, that to know the truth, you are to be born again. That’s not only in the bible. You see if you take Patanjali which is a very ancient book, it’s not that the Patanjali asked you to stand on your heads, is wrong, it’s just a wee, wee, wee, wee bit of it. But what Patanjali has written is that you have to achieve the truth on your central nervous system through your ATMASAKSHAT, the word is written, meaning the experience of your SPIRIT.
Now English language has an advantage and a disadvantage, that the spirit could be alcohol, the spirit could be an alcohol! Or spirit could be a dead body, it could be any circumstance, but it is not so. There are three separate things, absolutely opposite to each other. So the ATMA the SPIRIT has to be found out, is said even by Mohammed Sahib, he said you are to become the PIR, is said by. Zoroaster, is said by Loa Tse, is also said by Zen. Buddha has said it, Mahavira has said it, everyone of them has said it, so many religions have started in the name of God without going to the truth, that you have to be born again.

Now you have to be born again does mean that you certify yourself ‘I am born again’. Self certificate, you can call it ‘I am born again’, but you don’t become. What is so special if you are born again, what should be so? The human awareness at this level is just ready to be born again. Now in Sanskrit the word for a bird is DWIJAHA, means born again, and also for a Brahmin who is born again. But those who call themselves Brahmins are not Brahmins. They just call themselves Brahmins, have they come to know the Brahma, the all pervading power of God. Those who say they are born again, should feel the all pervading power of God around them, if they cannot feel it they are not born again. So all these self certificates are deception, self deception and deception of others, is just a money making process.

So the truth has to be achieved through your evolutionary process which is a living process. Again we must understand a LIVING process. Not you just talking, mental projections, just sitting down here big talk about it, or by giving you some courses, or taking some money from you. You cannot get it, it’s a STATE in a living growth, that proves that it is a living thing. Means the state of our awareness has to be higher than what it is. If our state cannot rise then it is not of any use. Like the seed becomes the roots then the bark, the leaves, the flowers then the fruit. Different states. In the same way a living religion must give you a different state and that nucleus of religion is within ourselves. Everyone of us has it. When we go against that living religion within us we go into imbalances. But even today people can ask why the religion, why should we have a balance, what is the need, lets go into imbalances, I mean, is that a logical question. People can ask why the religion, why has the religion in the stomach..........................so what is the religion we come to that point, is that, a religion is a valency of human beings.

Just like carbon has four valences human beings have ten valences, which matter does not have. Animals have nine and human beings have ten valences. And when these ten valences go out of balance then, they go out of the quality of a human being. But still one can ask why do we have those ten valences. Because we have to ascend, because in the evolutionary process you have to ascend and you can never be satisfied with yourself unless and until you have achieved it. Especially the seekers, that’s why I say they are the special category because in this special category men of God will have to become prophets and they will have powers to make others prophets, said by William Blake. In your great country William Blake has said it.

When is that going to happen? It has to happen today, tonight. But there are barriers within us, built in, not because of anything else but only because we have misled ourselves. We have been going to various roads of seeking, whatever suited us, where ever we went to, we have tried to...............and we have insured ourselves within ourselves sometimes, we have built up certain barriers. Now when you become the prophet, actually become your own master, become a free person, you have to be a free person. So far you are not. You cannot overcome your own weaknesses, your own temptations, infatuations, emotional problems, mental worries - why? Because you are still standing in the waves of this turmoil. This troubled area where you just see the waves all the time and you are frightened of breaking down, but if you somehow or other get out of it and get into the boat of your own being, then you enjoy, you become a witness a Sakshi.

Even to understand the scriptures, you have to become a free person, which you are not. You have to be your own master, for that you cannot pay. I am too free, that I cannot accept it. To get your freedom of Spirit you can’t pay, because money is money. Money has no value in the Divine field. Nothing can bring forth this but your own ascent. And how do we ascend? Is there anything built within us? So what ever I am telling you today is the knowledge of the roots. What we see is the knowledge of the tree. We see it from outside, we see a leaf from out side, if we have to treat the leaf, we have to go to the roots. But from outside, when we see the tree we are still outside also. When you have to treat the leaf, you have to go to the roots, if you block out the leaf, it is dead. Then you put it under the microscope, you can go on seeing cells after that you can see the nucleus, you can go on analysing it, and analysing it making it dead, and dead and dead. But to treat it you have to go to the roots. And this knowledge of roots we have here.

There’s nothing wrong in knowing something new. These are not new ideas, these are ancient ideas, very ancient ideas. In the Bible it is described as the Holy Ghost. One priest was asked I saw ......................a very narrow minded priest, what do you know about Holy Ghost? He said “I am agnostic”. So then they said, what are you doing here? He said “I am doing my job”. If that is the attitude towards God, towards your inner knowledge, then you can never reach there as you cannot reach the tree through the leaf, you have to go to the roots. This has been available only to seers, like you can say William Blake. Like we had many in other countries, but they did not talk about it because perhaps that was not the time for people to know. But in many languages it is described.

Now the roots within us, if you can see this, are placed in this manner. When I went to America the Indian society invited me to talk to them about the unconscious. I had never read Jung, though I knew he was a realised soul at least he got his realization at the later time. So I said all right let me have a look, let me see .............theory, say, and as I opened the book I saw a diagram, what he had drawn of a human being and I said that’s the mistake. Because he saw human beings from outside and he described them in layers, like first he said is the unconscious that cannot be expressed, manifested then the unconscious that can be manifested, then he said about at least the sub-conscious and then he said above that is the conscious mind, then above that is the ego. Like layers, one after another.

Now when you are sitting here, though you are in layers the path is laid down. In the same way within us, God being the greatest organiser, he has not made us into layers but what he has made us in a parallel way, as you can see there very clearly. Left side and right side. Left side and right side, the central path, three paths he has made within us, for our evolutionary process. The central path works out our evolution. The left side gives us the desire and the right side gives us the power of action. These are just the principles I am telling you but you can understand it slowly when you grow, all the details of it.

The central path is evolution, has brought you today to this level of human awareness. Now beyond that is a very short ascent which you have to achieve; by which you become the Spirit. But there has to be some living process for this to happen. And what is that living process built within us, is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us in the triangular bone, which is called as Kundalini in Sanskrit language. This exists within us, and you can see with your naked eyes, sometimes, in some people where there is an obstruction in the higher centres, it starts pulsating. And when we can sense, we can also see it clearly in some people when it is obstructing. Or through your stethoscope you can feel the percussion which we call as anahat at the top of the head here, where it pulsates and then it breaks. When this breaks the pulsation stops and you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your fontanel bone area. This is a happening and not ..............................in the sense that the happening takes place so that you get connected with the truth.

So the connection takes place and you start feeling on your finger tips the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost which surrounds you. Actually, you start feeling. But then as the rational mind says so what! Though we feel the cool breeze, so what? Then one should know, that when we have eyes we start seeing, when we have ears we start hearing, so now you have got a new awareness, what is this awareness? This is the awareness of collective consciousness, that you become, again I say you become, you are not just certified but you become, it’s a question of becoming, that you become collectively conscious. That on your central nervous system you can feel another person, you can feel yourself, you can feel your centres which are shown here, you can feel the centres of others on your fingertips. And the best one is, is Mohammed Sahib, I would say because he made it clear, at the time of resurrection your hands will speak. But who talks about the resurrection? Nowhere! People talk about it, they talk about the doomsday, because they can frighten people of the doomsday first, and take advantage of it and make money out of it.

God who has made this universe, he feels love, do you think he will destroy this great creation of his without giving us the fruit, without letting us know the fruit of his creation. He is the wisest of wise. The greatest compassionate source of love, how could he allow this universe to be destroyed, especially this Earth, which is a special present from him. So don’t believe in all these stupid ideas of destruction and the last complete devastation. Still lot of plans, you are suppose to enjoy the blessings of the Divine for which he has created you.

So the experience of truth has to be felt on the central nervous system. The problem is, not that you belong, you may feel, but as you know the experience is very slow in the western countries. I am sorry, not that you are in any way less seekers, you are very great seekers, I would say you are greater seekers than the Indians are, much greater seekers. Indians have still a lot of steps to come up to your level, no doubt, but while coming up to this level, you have developed a lot of problems around and that’s why the seeking is sometimes, takes time to express itself as a fruitful gain of Self Realization.

So you’ll get your self realization no doubt but again the Kundalini goes down. I must tell you very frankly, because I cannot be dishonest, but it can be brought up, by you, by understanding how to work it out. By co-operating with your self, by understanding your self, that you are the temple of God and that you have to work it out with respect to yourself, and you have to give some time. I mean in Caxton Hall, you must have seen there, thousands of people have got it. I have been working in this England for twelve years now, twelve years, is the last year now. Special reason for that, but what I find, people get their realization and then they’re lost. Then when they have some disease or something, they’ll telephone to me Mother, now I am............. has happened or I am suffering from cancer...........................is too far gone a case, but if you know how to handle your roots, how to nourish it, how to look after it, then you flower out, you bear fruits, and by your fruits people know what it is. Then you become trees, giant trees, like moving trees. And when people come under such trees, get realization.

English are a great people no doubt, they are placed in a country which is the heart of the universe, you are very important. I have given the maximum time to England, you’ll be amazed, maximum time. But the Sahaja Yogis who are not in the country have grown much faster than in England. The reason is, it’s like the foundation that always gets (damp in it) you are the ..................................................foundation. Remove the darkness, again it gets dark. Rather difficult! But once they are settled, you will be circulating the Divine interpretation, the Divine experience of truth all over the world. You are like the hard-core and this is what you have to do. We cannot be mediocre in Sahaja Yoga. There is no compromise with your self, you become so powerful that you don’t compromise also, you can just get out of everything in no time. But you must accept yourself first of all, have faith in yourself. Once upon a time the English had too much faith in themselves, I mean extraordinarily powerful people, now they are the other way around, they have no faith. You see now this darkness has come and ....the darkness has come ...................thrown out.

This is the second phase that I find is complete lethargy. Oh what can happen, let us be destroyed Mother, now that’s the best part, completely reconciled to our doom. Now how to get them to be creative? We have to circulate. They are the cells, who are like in the heart, who have to pump the heart............................... So I have to make a humble request, that I know experience of Sahaja Yoga is slow but very steady and I am sure that today I have got people who are a rare quality of courage. And as individual which was the English character, once upon a time, and that they will take it up seriously, their ascent and the ascent of the whole world.

We’ll be having about three more lectures and there I will tell you more elaborately about Kundalini and the Chakras, about all this knowledge. All this knowledge is available to you. Now, because this time was for you to know all these secrets. Some newspaper people asked me, Mother have you got your disciples all very big scholars, I said no, they are very ordinary people. Some may be, they are more difficult, but mostly they are very normal, ordinary people. Simple people. But what makes you think that? They said they are so scholarly they know so much, because you become the knowledge.

So truth is the knowledge, the rest of it is all mythical. Is mythical, what do we know about things is all mythical, because what ever we see from outside, is outside. Like I would say we appreciate Mona Lisa, we appreciate the miracles as we say, the great miracles that human beings have created. Why? Why do we call them miracles? Sometimes we think that we have observed a very miraculous task, they are, mentally we think. But actually it is not so. Because they have vibrations, they have Divine vibrations, they emit vibrations and they appeal to you because in your heart lies that Spirit, which is the universal being and which gives that feeling of bewilderment when you see these great miracles human beings have created. At least I have seen six of them, and all of them have tremendous vibrations. But unless and until you become a realised soul, how will you know? (silence)

Now this is the only .............. and to become the realised soul you have to have the ascent of the Kundalini and proper state of that Kundalini to remain there and that’s the point where I found we lack in the efforts. Lack in courage, in patience, so again and again I request you that don’t be superficial. The Americans were superficial, you better not be. You be solid people, serious, take it up seriously. Because you are going to be the Europeans, the Americans even the Greeks, even the Italians, the problem is the horse is behind the cart.........................but what do I do, prove to the horse, that you get up now because of you the cart is not moving. That’s why ...........very very special ..........to see you all, that you must decide that if we get our Realization, we’ll establish ourselves into Sahaja Yoga. For which you don’t have to pay, there’s no membership, there’s no organisation, nothing. I have nothing to take from you. You can’t give me.

So I hope today, many who are new will get their Realization and establish themselves and will not forget it. Because in the beginning the experience is very great, you feel like you are coming out of a pub. I don’t know what that experience is, must be that way (laughter) because I’ve seen so many people coming and falling down and again going in, must be some memory of something great, must be that. So by God’s grace you should all get your Realization and I would like to have some questions, but in that I would like to say that there are people I know, we have had before also, belonging to some gurus or something big, like some gurus have come too, because you see they feel, the gurus are feeling that I may been attacking them; in a way, they feel that way because I say you cannot pay, so their profession is finished. So they get angry with me for that, so they might be saying they are in .................and attack her and all sorts of things and there could be some people who are impressive because of other problems of ego or something. So you need not be offensive, I have come here to give you what you have and you need not be also docile about it or slavish. I have come here to give you or tell you what is free.

Now you may also say, it is a very common question that arises in your mind, and justified, that why should I do it, now that’s the miserable part of it, that I have to do it, I wish you could do it, but you can’t that’s the problem. And if I have to do it, I don’t hurt your ego. No! I don’t want to hurt it. You see this is something people don’t understand, that why should I do it. You can do it also, but first I have to take you little bit............your awareness has to grow a little more, then you can do it your way, but first definitely, I have to do that. Which is a .........it makes me also a miserable person because............you know...........a thankless job, but I have to do it. Maybe I am doing it for it somehow, I don’t know...........but it should be............It’s a crucifixion, I tell you, it’s not easy, it’s a very difficult task. It’s like mountains sometimes, the Kundalini is just embedded, poor thing sometimes so hurt, so wounded that to raise that Kundalini itself takes such a load, effort. But one has to do it and I know I have to do it. When you will know what it is, you will not be angry with me, but you will understand the task and .............all of us, all of us have to do it.

May God Bless You.
