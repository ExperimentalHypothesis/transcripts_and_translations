b'Evening Program, Debu Choudhry Concert, Eve of Diwali Puja\n\nRemarks on the evening before, audio 3, 1:19 minutes:\nSame ideas; it is all self-destructive, believe Me. You look funny with it. All right, little oil, do it properly, make it properly combing, you are not hippies. This thing started with the hippyism. Now hippy is finished. Now a new thing has started, yuppies, they put oil, nicely do groom their hair. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be yuppies either, but you should look proper, because what I feel that you don\xe2\x80\x99t look after your Sahastrara. And if you have hair like that you look like a bhoot, to be very frank, according to Indian standard. And the bhoots go into you, because they think there is some bhoot going, to be very frank. All right, so please put little oil. Everyday, little oil, please put. You can put some water, wash it and little do it, and then clean it off, in the morning time so that you won\xe2\x80\x99t have any problem. Have you seen Debu Choudhry? See his hair. He\xe2\x80\x99s such a grown-up, matured man. His hair are so good. Or you want to have bald heads?\n[Shri Mataji is laughing.]\nShri Mataji: I\xe2\x80\x99m entrusting him out.\nNew Sahaja Yogini: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\nSahaja Yogi: She\xe2\x80\x99s very new, Ma.\nNew Sahaja Yogini: Ha, I\xe2\x80\x99ll comb hair.'
