Musical evening Program, Pandit Debu Chaudhuri, sitar player, Eve of Diwali Puja, 1989

[Audio 2:]

It was astounding the way, today, Debuji played so well. Every time we hear him, there's such a variety and such deep understanding of the principle of music. And the principle of music is that it should entertain the Spirit. You being Sahaja Yogis and most of you have never learnt any Indian music as such like Me.
But it’s a fact that Indian music comes from Omkara, from the Divine source of sound. And that’s why that can first entertains, amuses the Spirit. Otherwise, the Spirit is so satisfied by itself. It enjoys itself. But with music and art, I feel it gets its reflection to see, reflects its own beautiful existence. It is permeating into every little particle, into every molecule, into every atom. And that reflection, when the Spirit sees, it has that new dimension of a beautiful expansion of its personality. And, as if you feel you are resounding in the whole universe.

It’s the beauty of Indian music is this, especially with Debu [Chaudhuri], I’m very grateful to him that he has come here with his son Prateek whom I’ve seen as a little boy. And it’s so heartening to see that he has taken this art so seriously. Normally these days, young boys do not take to art much. And that he should learn from his father! That’s even a greater thing. That we have such delicate weaving and such strong strokes of depth from Debu.

And he is creating mirth, affecting like stars [unsure] creating mirth from Debu was something, we can say, like some of the very, very senior seekers ever. They were playing some sort of a hymn. It was a beautiful combination of God Father and Son. I bless them from my heart for giving us such a beautiful feeling of expansion within ourselves of our "jivan".

Then we have Saumna, Saumnaji [spelling unsure]. He is a very good artist and he’s so well played today. So much in concord and understanding with both of them. It was such a beautiful trio. I’m really thankful to them that they came all the way from India to play for us here. And Devuji is a Realized soul, his son is a Realized soul, they are all Realized souls. And the rapport between them and you, was so beautifully done. I mean, it is not possible to describe the joy the "ananda" that you felt with this. Only, one can say that the collectivity of enjoyment one can have through this kind of music.

I hope some of you also become from this, dedicate yourself to this art of music because for a Realized soul it is very easy to go further with it and to progress with it, though it’s a big tapasya. Indian music is not an easy thing. It’s a great dedication, concentration and grievance, otherwise you do not work it out. I’m happy that there are some Sahaja Yogis who are now taking lessons in table and also in classical music. And the way our Sahaja Yogis sing is something remarkable that even the Maharashtrians, actors and actresses who sing very well had come to a program and they said that, "We really felt ashamed of ourselves the way the Sahaja Yogis were singing Marathi songs and the way they were so beautifully and rhythmically bind and how they put us together with them."

So, it’s a very beautiful net that binds us together for our collectivity, for our delicate feelings, and how we should be with each other, like the music. Because the notes, they are very deep, very deep, touching your heart and they are spreading a kind of light of love in your heart. And that touches each other’s heart. And that’s what should be the understanding of music that it should really reach our heart.
And through our heart, we should try to feel other people, their depth and their wisdom, their understanding and a kind od a beautiful anxiety to please others, to make others happy, to entertain them.

And the little Prateek, I’m so happy! Prateek means "symbol" [pratika], you know, he is a symbol of music. I hope he comes up very well and gets a very big name in the whole world. And now Saumna, these are real boys coming out and they should keep it up. I feel so very, very happy about the way of young people are taking to music and especially, if Sahaja Yogis take to this music, it will be a very, very demanding thing today because Indian music is now being neglected very much by the younger generations in India. It’s a very sad thing that is happening.

Shri Mataji: Same ideas; it is all self-destructive, believe Me. You look funny with it. All right, little oil, do it properly, make it properly combing, you are not hippies. This thing started with the hippyism. Now hippy is finished. Now a new thing has started, yuppies, they put oil, nicely do groom their hair. I don’t want you to be yuppies either, but you should look proper, because what I feel that you don’t look after your Sahasrara. And if you have hair like that you look like a bhoot, to be very frank, according to Indian standard. And the bhoots go into you, because they think there is some bhoot going, to be very frank.

All right, so please put little oil. Everyday, little oil, please put. You can put some water, wash it and little do it, and then clean it off, in the morning time so that you won’t have any problem. Have you seen Debu Chaudhuri? See his hair! He’s such a grown-up, matured man. His hair are so good. Or you want to have bald heads?
[Shri Mataji is laughing.]
Shri Mataji: I’m entrusting him out.
New Sahaja Yogini: Yes, I’ll do.
Sahaja Yogi: She’s very new, Ma.
New Sahaja Yogini: Ha, I’ll comb hair.
