威廉‧布莱克展览中的讲话

1985年11月28日 英国

我们今天很荣幸,能对这个伟大的诗人、画家和先知威廉‧布莱克(William Blake)致敬。我初来英国时,有人告诉我,英国是学术文化荟萃之地,有很多博物馆,可以看很多展览。有一天,我对那些霎哈嘉瑜伽修习者说,我想到某展览馆看威廉‧布莱克的画。他们都觉得很惊奇,因为我很少去看展览,特别少去图书馆及看书。我去到的时候,我看见这位伟大诗人的画,他以真诚关切之心,以他对上天深切的了解,去告知英国的人民,上天的力量如何伟大。但我在看时,却发现有些愚蠢的人,拿着放大镜,看画中人物的私处,他们还拍照,他们对上天毫无了解。于是我想到布莱克在世时,与这些人在一起,一定是受了许多苦楚。他一定曾经在荒野里哭泣。那时的人根本不可能接受他,那些低俗的心灵根本没可能了解超越和伟大的心灵。我的心痛起来。主啊!为甚么要他降生在这样的一个地方,叫他受苦,叫他说一些人们根本不可能接受的话。

但我知道他是谁,他要做甚么,为甚么他要生在那里。我们对他所知不多,因为关于他的书,读了也没有甚么用,也不会知道他是谁。他是个降世神祇,是左脉神祇巴尔伐亚(Bhairava),或称左天使长圣米迦勒(St. Michael)的降世。他也是英国的守护天使。他因此而降世,他要在世上毫无畏惧地宣示上天的知识。他必须要用象征性的语言,如果你是个已得到自觉的灵,便不难明白他。于是你便能随着他哭,随着他笑,随着他观看这一出世界的戏剧。

当我读他的诗时,我很惊奇他的幽默感,我想他就像印度的诗人默根迪亚和迦比尔。他们都勇敢无惧的讥评社会,他们都是很公开,很直接,直率的说出来,但同时有很温柔的一面。布莱克用他受启发的眼睛看教会,发觉他们所行的,刚刚与基督的教导相反。我也是这样觉得,我生长在基督教家庭,我对基督徒的行为感到震惊,不禁要问:这些是基督徒吗?问题很简单,有些人的温柔只是种客套。好像很多人爱说:「我恐怕...」「我猜...」。布莱克说,耶稣基督不是那种好好先生。我也常常说:我不是在作竞选,不是在讨好你们,我要令你们找到自己,享受自己,找到自己的宝贵财富。

因此布莱克描绘的耶稣基督,不会到处讨好别人。这都是表面的。但耶稣对那些低下的人很温柔,他使那些渔夫,那些没有受过教育的人,变成圣徒。这些人原来是社会中最低下的。耶稣基督并没有去找那些高高在上的统治者。你们看那些执掌宗教的人,只有兴趣找那些王侯将相,向他们鞠躬礼拜。来自上天的人,怎会对人间这种政治有兴趣?

我们都不明白这点,我们将一切都理性化,幸好布莱克出来批评这种理性。现在有许多知识分子,把耶稣基督贬低为凡人,因为布莱克本身是属于上天的,所以能明白耶稣。布莱克常常受人逼害,有时会陷入情绪低落之中。而且他有金钱的问题,及来自兄弟姊妹的问题,人人都令他难受。

这样一个优美的灵魂来到世上,给世人宣示耶路撒冷的来临。耶路撒冷是甚么意思?在西方,耶稣基督被抑贬为普通的凡人。今人对耶稣基督的描绘,令我感到震惊。他们从那里获得这个形象?他们到底有没有眼睛?他们是瞎眼的吗?你们的主教、大主教都这样说。他们对神是无所畏惧的吗?如果你们这样评论耶稣,你们的国家会变成怎样?现在有些绘画和电影,把耶稣描绘成毫无道德的人,把祂的母亲描绘为没穿衣服的,那是不敬的。就算布莱克把人画成是赤裸的,但神不会是赤裸的,那是一种尊重。现在那些所谓知识分子的所作所为,只会带来上天的震怒。

布莱克是个印刷人,为甚么他要做个印刷人呢?他曾描绘那些书如何在地狱中生产,如何在每一个轮穴中制造出一个魔怪,然后被放在图书馆中。因此我也不喜欢看书。为甚么他要做个印刷人呢?这是很重要的,我们需要知道。为甚么他要这样多的谈论印刷呢?你们看今日的传播媒介,这便是布莱克所说的魔怪之一。那些传播媒介令你盲目相信,赚你们的钱,同时使你们和你们的子女变得更弱,有系统地令社会彻底破坏。布莱克希望抵抗这些传媒,因此他才成为印刷人,从根源处去打击他们。不论我们是否喜欢,传媒正日渐壮大。今日的传媒,令人无法明白,他们对我们的根,对我们的命运,对我们的超越理想,造成多大伤害。

有一次电视台邀请我作访问,我很震惊,他们说英美人士不可能明白与钱无关的事情。我说你们先要得到自觉,否则我便不来接受访问。这便是耶稣基督所作的,他大可以一天到晚呆在那些大人物处,或跪下求情,要求宽恕。宁愿被钉在十字架上,那表示甚么?那表示那些愚蠢的人,把一个伟大的人钉死了。

因此我说布莱克是个伟大的先知,他预言道:如果你们不返回正途,如果你们不求向上升进,所有的都要发生。这是关于我们的,是要发生在我们身上的,发生在我们家庭之上的,发生在我们子女身上的,发生在我们社会之上的,发生在我们国家上的。且让我们勇敢面对。上天的爱,对那些麻木的心灵来说,也是没有效用的。

霎哈嘉瑜伽一早已来到世上,远在我降世以前已来到了。今天霎哈嘉瑜伽在印度开始,我来英国不过十二年。布莱克花了十四年时间写出耶路撒冷诗篇,如果到了十四年的时候,在这片他希望建立耶路撒冷之地,我们能做出一点工作,我便对你们感激不尽了。

但现况却令人失望,上天的话他们听不入耳,人们只喜欢自己爱听的话。你要讨好他们,利用他们的弱点,说他们做的坏事都是好事。耶稣的爱与慈悲可以成就奇迹,这是无可怀疑的,因为耶稣基督是为我们而降生的,整个宇宙是为我们创造的。我们要去接受上天的祝福,我们都要成为永恒的灵,就是你们说的得到重生。但从历史,从周围环境而来的思想积习,深深地束缚着我们,使我们忘记我们要将眼睛望向天上。布莱克的一生是另一次的被钉上十字架,我常为此泪流不已。

......

他说耶稣基督不理会祂的父母,十二岁那年便离家出走。不是说现在十二岁的儿童都离家出走,并去吸毒,因此我们可以因此而尊崇基督。耶稣说:「这是我天父的事业,我为甚么要担心我的父母?」那不是说你们都不要孝顺父母,而是你要追求更高的事物,走不同的方向。你走这个方向,要过平衡的生活,但我是要追求升进的。这是他要给你们清楚展示的讯息。无论他说得多么有爱心,多么温柔,多么谦卑,你们是要升进的,要成为永恒的灵。

我告诉你们许多次,英国是宇宙中一片很重要的地方,不知有多少个英国人知道,英国是宇宙的心轮。但现在我们在这心轮处得到些甚么?如果耶稣今天来英国,会被拒入境,因为他不是英国人。但现在我们在这心轮处得到些甚么?我们虐待我们的小孩子。你们都坐在宇宙的心脏处,这是宇宙的心脏,你们可给整个世界一些甚么?永恒的灵就在心脏处,此所以布莱克说:「英国要成为耶路撒冷。」因为那是心脏的所在。这即是说永恒的灵要在宇宙的注意力之中,否则事情便不能成就。但这个灵,何时才会被唤醒呢?

这个灵要在人类之中被唤醒。而那些在心脏处的人类在哪里呢?那些住在这里的人怎样呢?就算是从印度来的人都是无用的,而土生土长的人都疲弱不堪,以致心脏疲弱得无法推动血液。从前是过份活跃,令世界侧目,风光过后,现在到了低落时期。我们要唤醒这个心脏,去使整个世界变成灵性的存有。我们知道自己的责任吗?我们知道作为一个灵性的人,我们的责任何在吗?你们现在要担当这个角色,但我们却没有,只忙于那些无意义的事情,我已在这里十二年,我希望多留两年,共十四年,希望到那时,耶路撒冷会露出它的端倪,你们是唯一能成就这事情的人。没有别的人能够做到,神选择你们生长在这片土地,就是要你们负起这个责任。

今天的人你很难跟他们说宗教。甚么宗教?那是包含所有宗教的宗教。我们谈的是内在的宗教,内在的轮穴使我们获得平衡,但今天的人很难跟他们说宗教,他们宁愿谈饮酒,谈酒吧。我们也不能在报章上谈宗教,却报导那些假导师,那些邪恶的人。但成千上万的人跟随他们,奉献所有钱财,变成乞丐。他们不想来到真理。为甚么?我常问自己,为甚么会变成这样。任何借口都没用,有这样一个人,曾告诉你们这么多的事情。

比如关于圣灵,布莱克说:「圣灵是个真空吗?」你试问一下人。我曾问过一位主教,圣灵是甚么?他说:「我是个无神论者。」我跟着问:「你在做甚么?」他说:「这是我的职业,就好像你有你的职业一样。」圣灵是甚么呢?布莱克说,圣灵就在你们之内,为甚么我们不去找寻圣灵藏在哪里?我们应该去找寻,圣经藏不下耶稣,整个宇宙也藏不下耶稣,为甚么我们不去找寻?现在英国的人都是自以为是的,实质上疲弱不堪。我们没有时间了,我们不要听任何人的,要自己出去找寻。甚么是圣灵?其实是很简单的,圣灵便是灵量(Kundalini)。你们试分析一下,他们说有三位一体:天父、圣子与圣灵。圣灵便是母亲。你们听说过,有父亲、儿子,却没有母亲的吗?圣灵是太初之母。很自然会得到那个结论,但人们却不能提及圣母。

因此布莱克谈及人(Albion)的女儿,因为他知道妇女受到歧视。梵文有句话说:哪里妇女受尊崇,便是神灵的所在。这种尊崇不是叫她们穿裸露的衣服,崇尚她们的裸体。现在女性受压逼,以至他们不想将神视为女性,所以他们说圣灵是只白鸽。为甚么我们要崇拜那白鸽?没有人解释,那是一个谜。现今世界有许多这样的谜。银行制度是个谜,钱往哪里去了是个谜,瑞士银行与黑手党的关系是个谜。一切都被隐瞒起来,说这只是海外银行。而我们不断继续这种虚伪的行为,不加深究。这些都是不能原谅的。对于那些狡滑奸险的人,我们怎样宽恕?对于撒旦,我们怎样宽恕?我们谈宽恕的时候,要有所分辨。

教会老是说你们是罪人。人有思想才会犯罪,老虎吃其他动物,牠不知道甚么是犯罪。他们老是说你是罪人,犯了这个罪,那个罪。人是上帝的圣殿。神用爱创造了他们,神创造这些莲花般的人类是为了甚么?把他们从摩耶幻相之中带出来,是为了甚么?是为了给人这样骂的吗?神创造这些莲花,是为了奉献给诸神的。用他们的香气,去照亮整个世界。他们是神的子女。但现在的人,把人视为剥削的对象,压逼的对象。因此布莱克说有两类人,一类要去剥削其他人,低贬其他人。他还说现代的宗教是天堂和地狱的妥协。而那些纯真的人却要受苦,那些好人要受苦。那是现在的现实。

现在且让我们联合起来,获得自觉,并成为永恒的灵。这是很容易的,因为圣灵,即灵量,就在你们之内。灵量潜藏在三角骨处,你们要把这个灵量唤醒。有些人或许会问:布莱克为甚么没有谈到灵量?因为无论他说甚么,有谁愿意去听呢?谁愿意去了解他呢?就算今日,我也找不到谁能了解他。他所宣示的,有谁愿意理会?如果他要说甚么事情,人们便觉得他古古怪怪,他说:「我一点都不介意。对于那些白痴,我说的话当然显得神怪。」他不知多少次用「白痴」、「蠢材」这类字眼。

在我眼中,每一个人都是神的子女,但我知道布莱克为甚么这样愤怒。我很了解他。他要在霎哈嘉瑜伽来临以前,对世人作当头棒喝。但当时人对他的评论是:他不能被接受,他是发疯的。今天我要被世人接受,我能为你们做到一切,照顾你们,给你们煮食,所有一个母亲能为孩子做的,我都给你们做到。但如果事情不能成就,母亲有时也要责骂孩子。母亲有时要将事情说得很明白,那是为了孩子的好处。但我们不能勉强别人得到自觉,问题便出在这里。好像俄国的霎哈嘉瑜伽修习者对我说:「母亲,来我们这里,给我们国家的领导人得到自觉。」我不能够这样做,他们要成为自由的人。

但当人有自由时,便不去珍惜。以至没有人是自由的,上街时我要除去那些首饰,要么不带银包,要么把它藏好,否则会被人打劫,没有一样东西是安全的。因此这种自由只是带来暴力,带来屠杀。我们不能善待我们的子女,不能善待其他人。这些都是所谓自由所带来的,这其实不是真的自由。我们要抛弃内在那个残酷的自我,否则无论到哪里去,走到右边或左边,始终是个问题。自由是要有智慧和尊重来配合的,如果不能做到尊重他人的自由,便不能真正享受自己的自由。因此要尊重人类的自由,要尊重这个自由,才能得到自觉,才能进入更高的自由。即布莱克所描绘过的自由。

这个国家有许多求道者,但有许多都迷失了。有些吸毒的人,来到霎哈嘉瑜伽以后,一夜之间放弃了吸毒的习惯。为甚么能够做到呢?因为神在你们之内早已创造了一个系统,当灵性之光照亮你们后,你们便变得很有力量。在此之前,如果叫你不要这样做,不要那样做,你是不能做到的,因为你没有永恒的灵给你的力量。在耶稣以前来到世上的大部分神祇,都不明白,如果不给人得到自觉,他们便没有永恒的灵给予的力量。耶稣明白这一点,所以祂说他们要得到重生,而且祂说你们要宽恕。耶稣知道要使他们得到平安,提升他们的灵量,让他们得到自觉,然后那人才变得有力量,并胜过试探。你们可以试探耶稣吗?当然不可以。同样,你们可以胜过试探,在自己的力量及光荣中升进。

霎哈嘉瑜伽在十二年前,我来到伦敦的时候同时来到。我不是来移民,我来是由于偶然的机会,或者说是上天的安排。我丈夫在三十四个国家之中被选在此出任工作,而且四次一致通过他连任下去,因此我们才会来到这个国家,否则我不会来英国教授霎哈嘉瑜伽。由于布莱克,我们要努力传扬,把英国变成耶路撒冷,无论遭遇多么的挫败和失望,也是不要紧的。我们要完成这个使命,布莱克有这个信心,英国有一天会变成耶路撒冷。

但首先今天在座的每一个人都先要获得自觉,而且在你们的自觉面前谦卑下来,不要狂妄自大。布莱克说:「耶稣不会在人类面前谦卑下来,但在神面前,却会谦卑下来。」同样,你们要在你们的灵、你们的自觉面前谦卑下来,并且要达到那最高的境界。令人惊奇的是,在印度,我们一早已具备这个知识,但他们只是把印度人视为奴隶,没有兴趣知道这根源的知识。至于那些知识分子,他们只顾甚么牛津剑桥的传统。对于这些人,根本无法说明那根源的知识。这个知识不仅是为了印度,不仅是为了某个国家,而是为了整个世界。就像你们的科学知识,也是为了全世界,传到东方来,人们都接受。同样,接受这从东方而来的,有益于你们的知识,对你们有甚么损害?是否只是由于这知识从东方来,你们便觉得不安吗?耶稣基督是从哪里来的?是从美国来的吗?

在西方人中,无可否认,英国人是最成熟的,但我们却跟随那些美国人、法国人。我们知道自己是甚么吗?我们是智慧。我们是代表宇宙心脏的人,从布莱克的时代到今天,我希望你们已经成熟起来,知道要有一个突破。

还记得他们最初印制宣传单张时,把我的脸孔印得很黑。我说:「那是不成的,没有人会来参加静坐。」人们会说:「看,有个从非洲来的人,要教我们耶路撒冷。」因此我们要重印那些单张,使我看起来不是那样黑。皮肤的颜色有甚么重要?真正的颜色来自你们的心,那种美丽来自你们的心。真理的美丽处在能起作用。且让我们把它实现出来,那是很简单的,但不要走向知识分子的道路,用有限的大脑来了解,我们要走向那无限,那便是你们的灵。那会让我们得到集体意识,得到知识。知识的意思不是指你们大脑所学到的,而是你们通过中枢神经系统所感应到的,你们可以在指掌上感应到你们的能量中心。

我已说过很多遍,到了复活之日,连你们的手都会说话。你们看这些回教徒,很少谈复活之日。但古兰经所讲的,大都有关复活之日。他们老是谈末世,使人害怕,便奉献钱财。他们说捐了钱的人,末日来时,便会得救。每一个宗教都是如此,用来赚钱,干预政治。我真不明白为何钻石会掉进这些污泥之中,香气变成肮脏,这是我不可能明白的。人的力量有时还超越神,他们能够将真理变成愚蠢和无意义的事情。而且他们能够与之共存。你去问他们,他们会说:「有甚么不对?」这是对整个创造多么大的浪费。人是在何等的冀望下被创造出来的。我们要做些甚么,才能让他们明白自己是谁?明白上天对他们的期望。有时,我也在荒野里哭泣,我也深切感受到诗人的痛苦。他们来到世上,不断的受苦,不断的受苦。

今天我希望你们明白,借着诚恳,你们才能明白自己。没有任何书籍,没有任何社会教化,可以说服你们,只有那诚恳的心,那对永恒的灵的渴求。这都是内在于你们的。而那种诚恳,我称之为纯洁的欲望。如果你们有这种纯洁的欲望,即你们灵量的力量,你们便可实时获得自觉。你们只要有纯洁的欲望,便能做到,毋须别的。

当灵量升起来以后,你们便要照顾你们的自觉,这样才能不断生长。我没有给你们详细说明霎哈嘉瑜伽,那是太多了。布莱克和其他许多诗人都希望成就这个工作。但现在有些新派诗人,他们讨好传媒,为了赚钱,愚弄我们。他们只会用花言巧语,引导人们落入地狱。要小心他们,你们要将子子孙孙从他们手中救出来。要拯救整个社会,要拯救整个英国,因为如果心脏死去,整个宇宙也会死亡。

愿神祝福你们。

The Sahaja Yogis didn't want Me to allow you to ask Me questions, but I think better ask Me some questions.Q.....about the chakras....

Shri Mataji: Yes sir. That's what I said, that I didn't talk about them because it would be too long a lecture but we have got a book on this, a little book and there it is all written though I say that before realization don't even read that book, can create problems. You can know all about the subtle side, the chakras and everything without paying anything, without any effort. There are people now in England, you will be surprised, so many of them are excellent Sahaja yogis who are experts and they will tell you all about it very clearly. We have got books to explain. As you see there are seven chakras are shown here. The lowermost is the Mooladhara Chakra, is the innocence.

Q:...can you see it with your eyes, outside the body, can you see it?Shri Mataji: If you see something then you are not that. And people have seen it because they were not that, because they moved on the sides, on the sympathetic nervous system, what we call the Ida and Pingala. When you go on sympathetic nervous system you can see it from outside. Like this building you can see it from outside, but when you are in it you don't see it, you see only the inside. So that's what it is, when you ascend, you need not see anything, you become, you get the powers. People have seen it no doubt, but that one should not ask for. I can see the glass - better to drink the water. Now what else?

Q:....what do You do with all Your wealth, all your money?Shri Mataji: My money? Are you from the bank? What I do with My money - what do you want Me to do? What sort of a question is this? Ask a simple straightforward question madam I don't understand what do I do with My money, I don't do anything with it. Actually My husband manages his money, I ask him whatever I like. Of course he earns a lot no doubt, he earns very much. I sometimes tell him, "I'm ashamed the way they give you money," because he doesn't even pay any tax you know. Of course I do spend some money on Sahaja Yoga, I must confess I have to sometimes, what to do? One has to and these people have their own ashrams, where they stay, and look after it. For this hall they must have collected some money I don't know, I don't know what do they do with their money, I don't know, I have no idea, I've never seen that. They are honest people, they all know all about it. I don't know anything, I have nothing to do with it. This is the aggressiveness, "What do I do with My money" Just look at this. Yes sir?

Q....a man has mental illness, he wants to know whether he'll have it after he dies....Shri Mataji: No, no, no, just now you can cure it. Why to think of death? You can be cured of your mental illness at least, minimum, that could be done.

Q....How can you tell that it's Self-realization? You feel a breeze but how does it become...Shri Mataji: You see, when you feel the cool breeze is the beginning of it, all right? Now you have to see what this cool breeze is, all right? Now if you go to a college of science or a college of medicine what you have to do is to see what it is, isn't it; and to see whatever it says does it prove. Now, when you see the cool breeze in your hand, what happens that it is, as I said, is the compassion of God say for example, you just believe in the hypothesis just now. Now what is this compassion doing, is made you a computer. On the fingertips you can tell what centers are catching, of yours and of others, so you become the diagnosis. Now if you know a little few gestures by which you can handle this power, you can cure them. That's the minimum, all right? You can know from this whether you have mental problem or you have emotional problem, or you have physical problem and of what nature. This is how is the self-knowledge starts, from the very basics.

What's your problem with you, first let us see the problem on the centers, all right? Then you move forward when you go with it, then you understand what's the problem with others; then what's the problem in the collective; then what's the problem of this country; and if you know how to solve them, sitting down here, you can do it, you can solve it. But this is the breeze which has to be felt first because this is the breeze which we call as the all-pervading power of God. Now, just because I say you should not believe Me, because blind faith is of no use, but you can experiment and see for yourself. Even little children know. They can tell you what is catching in you, what chakras are catching. You can have ten children, ‘fold' their eyes, put them before a gentleman, immediately they'll raise this finger or this finger. Supposing they raise this finger, means this person feels terribly guilty. He must be a Catholic that he feels so guilty. That the children won't say but you will know that this is the chakra is caught up here because he's feeling guilty.

Like that you can go on finding on your own being like a laboratory the whole thing becomes like a computer because it is knowledge, knowledge through your central nervous system, through your evolutionary process. But you have to practice and understand what it is. If I give you a car, how will you know it moves unless and until you get into it and know how to drive it, isn't it. You have to give some time, not much, but you enjoy, best part of it you enjoy doing the whole thing. It just flows automatically, you don't have to do anything about it.

But one has to learn, little bit, what it is. Before realization you don't have to do anything, it just forms spontaneously as the seed is sown in the Mother Earth, all right? Then when it comes out, then you have to look after it; the same way you have to look after your realization, respect it. Then you become the masters. We have one master standing here and we have so many. They are just like you to look at, but they know so much and they are so humble. They don't go about with a big plate on their heads "I am the master of this and master of that" nothing. They are doing all their jobs, they are doing very well, they are blessed and also they are helping people to get their realization. You'll be surprised in Sahaja Yoga very difficult to get an unemployed person. All of them are employed. If they are unemployed they get employment with God also. Basically they are employed by God. All right?

Q... is this the only way to get realization?Shri Mataji: Yes, of course; there cannot be another, God could not make thousand and one, could He? That would be too much of a headache , like as you sprout the seed, how do you do it? Spontaneously. Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous, living process is always spontaneous. Now supposing we want to sprout a seed and we take out the primule, push it out and push it inside the Mother Earth, will it sprout - no. You have to take advantage of the powers of the Mother Earth, to sprout a seed, isn't it?

Q. ...saying she has not come across Sahaja Yoga in the religions, that there are many religions.Shri Mataji: In the religions there's no ... religions are no religions, that's the trouble is. I have told you all this just now that there is nothing, they will never mention that is sensible, but it's not so. I would say Sikhism, we can say is the latest religion. I mean there are so many verses about, much later than Islam, Sikhism came on this earth and they have said that, complete description, I mean you don't understand Hindi otherwise I would have told you - Ida, Pingala, Sushumna - everything they have described - Kabira has described at such length that we have in India a great poet Gyaneshwara and He has described all about kundalini. If you go in Maharashtra and tell them that somebody is going to awaken the kundalini, they'll all rush, they know all about it.

How many years did Christ live? How many times He could talk to people? How many of them accepted Him and how many of them understood Him? He went to a wrong place, I tell you; all were deaf, dumb and brainless. How will they understand? How could He talk about Kundalini when everybody was after His life? But He did talk of Holy Ghost, He talked of the Comforter He was going to send. He talked of so many things in that short time. Do you know for four years I was struggling with seven hippies in London; for four years. I must say, it's very creditable for Him in three and a half years to talk so much. How many years Blake had to work hard to talk to you? Is it easy to talk to people about truth? Very difficult; everybody is extremely intelligent and wise, nobody want to listen to anything, do they? But in India we have a tradition; we know it; that you have to ascend. The whole thing works out that way. If they talk of kundalini, not in the North so much, but in Maharashtra, if you go, if you go in the South, you'll be amazed six thousand people, seven thousand people come in a village. They have seen it, these people have seen it, they come in bullock carts, they come in, any way that is possible for them, buses, and trains, and they walk miles together when they hear I'm there.

Once I was coming from a program in the night and suddenly I found lots of people lying on the road. I said, "Who are these people?" They said, "Mother we couldn't reach Your program, we were late, You give us realization here." I said: "All right, have it." They had it, they are the ones who'll get much faster than anyone else, I know, that's why I don't mind spending some time here. Once I go there, you will see the whole country would be ablaze, I'm not telling you lies, you ask the people who have been there. They are very different type of people, to them most important is their spirit. If you tell them what, the way we talk about Christ here, so disrespectfully, without understanding, they are shocked. Any Indian who is a Christian or a Muslim or a Hindu, doesn't treat the way you treat Bible. The respect they have has come to them traditionally. Of course you don't judge Indians by the Indians who have come here. They like your company, they are this type, they are materialistic, they want to have money, they have come here to earn money, but the people who are in India in the villages, not in the cities, are still seeking, seeking God, they're very simple people, humble people.

Traditionally we have known for thousands of years. I talk of Markandeya who was there twelve thousand years back, who incarnated here as William Blake. Twelve thousand years back He said the same thing which is said in England after twelve thousand years, because that time I don't know what was here, may be only jungles, I think. And that is also waste, isn't it, tell Me, isn't it? How much could Christ talk about kundalini? He talked of Holy Ghost. But why stick on to that, now I have come to talk to you. Better take your realization; when He came, they talked of Moses, when Moses came they talked of Abraham. What about the present, I am with you, why not have your realization? All religions were built for this day, that you get your realization, to give you the balance, to give you that property by which you ascend. Like when we have an aeroplane, we fix it up properly; in the same way they wanted to fix you up, but the religions went astray, they made people crooked, the things they fixed, wrong bolts into wrong places, the whole aeroplane is in a tattered condition if it flies, it will all fall down. Better give up all those ideas. But kundalini is such a great force, it's such a great force; it comforts you, it cures you, it builds up all your centers and slowly moves upward and when if you get realization, also it goes back, attends to all these problems that you have. It's such a mother she is. Any other question, please?

Q. Why are you to be known as Mataji, Mother?Shri Mataji: I didn't follow.Yogi: Nor did I. Why are You to be known as Mataji?Shri Mataji: As Shri Mataji? That's the title they gave Me, what can I do? In India. You have to be an Indian to understand that. There are certain things described, about Shri Mataji. If you have read any books, of Adi Shankaracharya, or of Markandeya Himself, then you will know and the qualities described there of such a person, if they find it in someone, they call that person by that name, isn't it? Like Gandhiji was called as Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma means a bigger spirit than others, because he had that. He didn't care for himself or his own family, everything for his own, but he thought of the whole country; that's why he was called Mahatma. Now, but I didn't call Myself; if others want to call I think is all right, I have no objection. You can call anything, whatever you see, you can call that. By calling that, what is your objection? Can I ask you this question? Beg pardon? [No objection] No objection. All right, that's all right. See, then it's all right, if you understand that it is must be some reason also.(Further question from same person)

Q. Do you have some divine power?Shri Mataji: That you better find out; I am not going to be tactless on that. Christ said what was the truth, that He was the Son of God, all right, but they crucified Him. I don't want to get crucified so soon.

[INAUDIBLE Q:] But the one who is an Indian, who is an Indian and Englishman. [Hindi]. You see it is for an ... Indians understand it better. [Hindi]I'm sorry I'm speaking in Hindi because I have to little bit chastise the Indians here, I hope you don't mind. [Hindi]

Now, what is another question please? Yes please?

Q. Yogi: Mother, she is asking if you can cure physical ailment, I mean the answer's yes, that comes from Self-realization, no question.Shri Mataji with your permission, the majority of people have come for the experience and are anxious to have, I may be mistaken, but I think most people would like to stop questions and ...

Shri Mataji: But sometimes you know those who want to ask, let them ask, otherwise the brain will again put out a question. Now madam, what is it..?

(SY. She's asking You, Mother, what life was like for You as a child)?Shri Mataji: As a child? I mean that's another story; you come and see Me, I'll tell you all about it. Why do you want to know about My past and future? Let us at the present time to get your realization; makes no difference what I was as a child, or what I was as an old woman.

Yogi: ... She's asking whether you have an opinion about the growth of interest in spirituality in England...Shri Mataji: What spirituality?Yogi asks questioner: spiritualism or spirituality? Questioner answers: spiritualism.Shri Mataji: That's the witchcraft, revived; very, very dangerous. Ah, is very dangerous, never go near that, all this parapsychology and all those things. We have described all these things in our book; you can have a look at it. Is a very comprehensive thing, Sahaja Yoga is. Is the witchcraft, you may call it spirituality, because a spirit can be also a dead soul as I told you, in English language. There is no ‘ism' about God. It's infinite. ‘Isms' are all finite things.

Q. SY: she's praising Your lecture, Mother, and saying now that....she'll go back to read Blake again.Shri Mataji: I'm very happy, I'm very happy that you say that, madam, it's really such a great poet, but you'll be surprised in India, none of them brought Blake. We never read Blake there, never; you see we studied English language, we studied Shakespeare, we studied so many things, but never they mentioned Blake, you know. I don't know why. In the whole education system of India, they never mentioned Blake.

[another inaudible question ...]

Shri Mataji: That's very nice, such books you must read. Such books you must read.[Here someone disclaims in Sanskrit]You see there's a Sanskrit scholar here, but the greatest Guru is the Mother, don't you think so? The Mother is the Guru of the gurus. But it's very difficult, because guru is a hard stuff, you see. A mother has to be very soft, kind, gentle to manage the show, but the guru can be very hard and they are very hard people, but Mother as a guru is a difficult task, it's very enjoyable.

Now I have given at least eleven lectures on Guru tattwa, all right? So you can take tapes from them, you can read it and you will enjoy it very well. Here the Guru tattwa is expressed in the Void, there, where the ten Gurus actually incarnated basically and they reincarnated. Say we can start from Adi Nath, then we can come to other ones like Nanaka, Janaka. Janaka was much earlier, then we can say Abraham, Moses. All these were Guru tattwa, Socrates, all these were Guru tattwa people, the people who came as Prophets; the ones who came on this earth to teach us balance, to teach us the code of life. That was also important part, but that was forgot. Why? Why the code, why the religion? Religion is for the ascent, to build you up.

Q. ?TattwaShri Mataji: Tattwam assi, that's what is the tattwa there; tattwa is there; tattwa is nothing but your kundalini is your tattwa, is the principle....

Q: [INAUDIBLE] Parvati, Shiva; She's also called as Kundalini.Shri Mataji: Of course. Yes, yes, it is all over, same thing. I'm just giving you the gist of it.

SY: She's asking, Mother, who was Mother Durga, she's asking about who was Mother Durga?Shri Mataji: A very direct question; I told you, I'm very tactful, I'm not going to confess anything. You better find out, it's better to find out. It's nice, isn't it? To find out yourself.

Yogi: ...I'll explain, Mother, the program is that tonight will be the experience of realization and we have another program on Saturday evening, here in the same place, which will be for this knowledge part; after realization, the knowledge makes more sense, so it's better to get the experience...Shri Mataji: But our experience is very funny, I must tell you that for My program, even if there may be one thousand people, for getting realization, after that they just get lost, never grow. That's only more in England, they just don't ... they'll get lost, I think they must be going to the pub after that. I can't explain why it happens but they just get lost, they don't want to know anything anymore. I don't know why, I cannot explain, I mean, is something I cannot explain. All right, let's have it now.

So now, if we are all settled down, it's very simple, Sahaj also means simple, Sahaj; saha means ‘with' ja means ‘born'; is born with you, this right to get this union, this yoga, is born with you, is within you and is the living process of the living God so it is spontaneous. Everything that is living is spontaneous and should happen to all of you, no doubt about it. You don't have to do anything as I said but you have to receive the power within yourself, to invite the kundalini to rise. Now first thing I have to request, I hope it is not too much of it, that we have to take out our shoes to touch the Mother Earth. Is very important because the Mother Earth is the one which sucks in, for a while. I don't know, is there a carpet there? Be in a mood of reception, and also of well-being, in a happy mood, because this is the greatest moment of our lives.

Now as I said that these fingers, here five, six and seven, on the same way this way, represent the two sides of the chakras within us, the sympathetic sides, so we have to put our hands like this, just like this, simple as that. And sit, not crossed legged but putting both the feet with respect, towards the Mother Earth, in parallel to each other. Now maybe some of you must have started feeling the cool breeze, I don't know, might have, because today's lecture was rather too terrific and William Blake must have worked it out I'm sure. But otherwise is very simple. Now we have to do is to ourselves awaken our own kundalini, which is very simple, which I will tell you. In the heart resides the spirit so first we'll have to put our hand to our heart. I will tell you one by one. And then in the upper part of your stomach where the guru tattwa is here, the principle of guru is there. Then in the lower part of the abdomen, where it is the divine, or we can say the pure knowledge that exists and which works. This is the center through which the pure knowledge, the pure technique, works. Then we take this hand again back, same way, up to this point where, it is here, when we are guilty we catch this chakra. Now here works our self-confidence, our faith in God that He forgives us. Then we put our hand on top of our head - this is the Agnya Chakra, which is very important. Here we forgive everyone; then at the back of the Agnya Chakra again, where we have to say that, "If we done any mistake, oh God forgive us". These are the two sides of the Agnya Chakra. And then you put your hand, stretch it, put this part on the fontanel bone area, the soft bone which was on top of our head and press it hard and move it hard, for a while. That's all one has to do. I'll tell you one by one.

First and foremost thing is, we have to close our eyes, because eyes take out our attention; but attention will be sucked inside our body in the sense it will go through the - just like this cloth - it is spread out, but as kundalini rises, She sucks it in and then pierces through this attention, enlight[en]ing all of that. It's a happening that takes place without any trouble whatsoever. As a result of that, what you get is the cool breeze coming out of your head; you can also feel the cool breeze in your fingertips; then later on in your hands and you get that shine on your skin. Christ has said, "The face that does not shine cannot become the star." And then you get that glint of shine of the spirit in your eyes. That's all, is not the point, is much, much, much, much more but just a wee bit that we have to today testify and later on to find out have we got realization all right, then can we work it out, can we do this, because later on we have to play our role now as a spiritual being, that's the point one has to understand.

So now, have respect for yourself first of all; and not to feel guilty at all. You are the temple of God, really believe Me you are made that way, only the light is to be kindled and that is in your heart. When the kundalini rises, she's something like an energy that does that because when she pierces through, this is the place where the God Almighty resides, who is reflected in our heart as the spirit and the all-pervading power, which is the Primordial Mother, the Holy Ghost, this vibrations that you feel, the power of God, the love of God which is represented within us as the kundalini, rises and unites us, our attention to the Divine. The spirit enlightens the attention and by that enlightenment you know, on your fingertips, on your central nervous system, through your new collective consciousness about yourself and about others. Through Sahaja Yoga you know how to cure, improve, and through this happening, through the spirit you enjoy because spirit - the nature of spirit is satchidanand, means it is the truth, it becomes the attention and it is the source of joy. Without getting realization you can be happy and unhappy but you cannot be joy, which has no dualism. You become the source of joy. Such a person, when he meets someone; he sees someone, he looks at someone, just a kataksh is sufficient to raise the kundalini - just a glance is sufficient to cure that person; just a thought, can give comfort to the other person. Miracles after miracles, so many miracles that as Sahaja yogis say, "miracle' has lost its meaning Mother, in Sahaja Yoga," that's true. So miracles of miracles and every moment you feel that God is looking after you.

When this great volcano burst, exploded in Mexico, a miracle happened they say, that the children were saved. The wrath - no this was not in Mexico but later on more in Colombia, because Colombia is sending all kinds of these horrible things all over the world, making money out of it. The wrath of the Mother Earth poured that mud and the people were drowned but the children survived. Their heads were above the mud, the body inside the mud. The same Mother Earth looked after them because they should not be burned so She covered them with the mud, why? Because of the innocence in them. Those who have even the slightest innocence in them will become realized souls, no doubt about it - slightest, a very wee bit. All the seekers are a special category of people and they have to become realized souls.

So forget about the past, forget whatever you have done in your seeking, whatever you are told, whatever you are branded with, just forget it and forgive yourself, once for all. This is I am telling you this because this is one of the biggest problems of the West that everybody sits down with a bad, horrible trouble here and sometimes I feel it so much that I can't even hear people. Is terrible. This portion is so bad here so I have to request you that please forgive yourself. You are the glory of God, without you God has no meaning also. It is He who is anxious, much more then you are, to give you realization. Just help Him out a little.

All right. Let us see. So we put our both the hands like this, close our eyes. Now you have to keep the left hand all the time towards Me, because is the desire, is expressed through it is the power of desire in the left hand which expresses that you want to have realization. The right hand is the power of action so you move your right hand but don't open your eyes. You have to keep your eyes all the time shut, just the opposite of mesmerism as you can see. Now please close your eyes; now put your right hand on your heart.

Now here you have to say, or ask Me a question, "Mother am I the spirit?" You may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever suits you. "Mother am I the spirit?" is a fundamental question and if you are a computer it will answer. "Mother am I the spirit?" Ask the question three times please. Put your left hand properly, please close your eyes; everybody should do it, please. It's uncivil not to close your eyes; please close your eyes because others may feel self-conscious so please close your eyes, to be courteous.

Now you have to take down your right hand on the upper part of your stomach, on the left hand side, we are working only on the left hand side. Here is the principle of the master. If you are the spirit, automatically you have to ask the second question, "Mother am I my own master? Mother am I my own guru?" Please ask this question, you have to ask this question three times again, without fear, with all confidence you ask this question, you are the spirit, you are your master.

Now move your right hand on the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side, lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of the divine work, of the divine knowledge or the pure knowledge, of the technique of divine manifestation. At this point I cannot force you to do anything, as I told you, you have to be free, I can only request you and here I say that you have to ask for the divine knowledge, you have to ask for the pure knowledge and when you ask for it the kundalini will start moving. Here with sincere heart, in a humble way you have to say, "Mother may I have the pure knowledge, Mother may I have the divine technique?" Ask this question six times because this center has got six petals.

Now to make the way easy for kundalini, we go along the same centers upwards so you put your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen, to make it easy for the kundalini to rise you have to open this center by asserting, by saying "Mother I am my own master", by saying "Mother I am my own master", ten times because there are ten petals, ten Sat gurus basically who incarnate ten times, of Prophets, the Masters.

Now raise your right hand on your heart, press it. With the same confidence you have to say twelve times "Mother I am the spirit, I am the spirit, I am the spirit". Just assert, that's a fact, that's the truth. Press it with your fingers. Now, twelve times, have full confidence in you, believe Me you are the spirit, you have to just become in the sense it has to come in your attention on to your central nervous system.

Now raise the right hand on the left hand side of your neck, in the corner where the neck and the shoulder meet, press it hard, take it backwards, press it hard. This is the most difficult center in the West, as I told you, that we feel guilty all the time but as I have told you, God is the ocean of love, ocean of compassion, but above all He is the ocean of forgiveness. He's the ocean of forgiveness. When He's the ocean of forgiveness, what guilt can we have that He cannot wash away or dissolve it? So just you have to say sixteen times because there are sixteen petals, to say sixteen times with full belief in yourself, "Mother I'm not guilty, Mother, I'm not guilty, Mother, I'm not guilty" sixteen times will you please say that "Shri Mataji I'm not guilty". If you still feel you are guilty and you can't forgive yourself, better say it to punish yourself hundred and eight times, if that pleases you.

When you forgive yourself you have to forgive others and so the greatest message of Christ, that we have to forgive others you have to put your hand to the center which is the adornment or we should say which adorns Christ, on the Agnya Chakra on your forehead, please put your right hand across,. Press it hard and here you have to say with full belief in yourself and in your powers that, "Shri Mataji I forgive everyone". Some may say that's very difficult but what do we do when we forgive or not forgive - no logic in it. But when we say that, then we are out of the clutches of other people, so please say, "Shri Mataji I forgive everyone. Now say it with your whole heart, how many times is not the point, please say it with your whole heart. Now you move your hand backwards onto the back side of the same center - Agnya - press it hard. Now here, you have to say once only without feeling guilty at all, without feeling no remorse, no condemnation, to God, one for your satisfaction, "Oh Lord, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me" but don't feel guilty, that's very important. Even without saying He has forgiven you. Better.

Now raise your right hand on top of your head, stretch your ... stretch your palm, press it hard on the fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone in your childhood, press it hard, move it seven times. Again here I cannot force anything on you. You have to say that you want your Self-realization that, "Mother, please give us our realization. We want our Self-realization. Please give me my Self-realization" and press it hard and move it seven times and say that. I'm sure it will work out.

Now bring down your hand, slowly, and bend your head a little bit and feel with your left hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Try to bend your head a little, little bit and about four inches above the head, bend it a little, that works out better sometimes. With your left hand, right hand towards Me and with the left hand you see the breeze. Right hand towards Me and then with the left hand you see, you can feel it better, with the left hand on top of your head; first with the left hand. Aah. Now put the left hand towards Me and with the right hand just see if it is blowing because it should come in both the hands. Open your eyes, open slowly and watch Me without thinking. Let us see if you can do it - just without thinking, just watch Me, without thinking. There's no thought in your mind, no thought. Now just put your hands like this, are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

Now put your hands up in the air, like this, and in your heart ask a question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Ask the question, put it up nicely, ask the question three times: "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the brahma shakti? Is this the all-pervading power of God? Ask the question. Now put down your hands and see for yourself if you feel the cool breeze. All those who have felt the cool breeze on the head, coming out of the head, or on their fingertips or in the hands please raise your hands, both the hands. That's Blake. You all have become Blake. May God bless you.

So many. May God bless you. But I must warn you, after this don't talk about it because it is beyond reasoning. Secondly you must come back, must all of you come back and work it out. Those who haven't got realization will also receive it. Those who have got it, will establish it. Please come back. You will enjoy the silence, the stillness within. But that's just the beginning of it. We have to go further. Otherwise you won't be able to manifest it properly. It has to be looked after. It's just a shoot that has come out, a little shoot we have to look after it. May God bless you all. Thank-you very much. Why not sing Jerusalem to them ... will be good idea.

Yogi: Mother with Your permission the music group would like to sing one song for You but before that we have a little memento of this evening which we would like to present.Shri Mataji: You want to sing, all right?
