关于威廉‧布莱克的公开讲座:

1985年11月28日 英国伦敦

对我们所有人来说真是莫大的荣幸,能向这位伟大的诗人、画家和先知--威廉‧布莱克(William Blake)致敬。我初来英国时,有人告诉我,英国是学术文化荟萃之地,有很多博物馆,可以看很多展览。一次心血来潮,我对那些霎哈嘉瑜伽练习者说,我想去Tate展览馆看威廉‧布莱克的画。他们都觉得很惊讶,因为我很少去看展览,特别少去图书馆及看书。去到那里,我看见这位伟大的诗人、这个了不起的人,以其如此的真诚关切,以其对上天如此深切的了解和感知,倾诉着心声,告知英国人民,上天的力量何等伟大。但让我惊讶的是,有些滑稽的人拿着放大镜在看画中人物的私处,我说“看看这些卑鄙无耻的人,他们看不到威廉‧布莱克想要描绘的崇高的、至高的东西。”他们还拍照,我对人们的反应感到惊诧。于是我意识到,布莱克在世时,与那些对上天一无所知的人在一起,一定受了许多苦。他曾经一定在荒野里痛哭过,也一定曾默默抽泣过。那时的人根本不可能接受他,那些低俗的心灵根本没可能接受崇高和伟大的东西。我心如刀绞。主啊!为什么他要降生在这样一个地方,叫他受尽折磨,叫他说一些人们根本不可能接受的言论。但事实并非如此,我知道他是谁,他要做什么,为什么他要在这里。我们对他所知不多,因为从书里你理解不了他是谁。

他是神祇巴尔伐亚(Bhairava)的降世,又称为天使长圣米迦勒(St. Michael)或乔治的降世。这位正是你们所说的英国的守护天使。他因此而降世,对他而言这就是他的角色,他要在世上毫无畏惧地公开宣示上天的知识。他必须要用象征性的语言,如果你是个已得到自觉的灵,便不难理解他。你将浏览他试图解释的一切,你能随着他时而笑,时而哭,跟随他观赏整出戏剧。

当阅读他的作品时,我惊叹于他的幽默感,他如此公开地发表这样的言论,感觉他就像印度的诗人默根迪亚或迦比尔。他们总是勇敢无惧地抨击社会使之回归正轨。但同时有很温柔的一面。如果你读泰戈尔的诗歌,会感觉如此柔美;他们都是相同的类型,极为公开、直接,你甚至可以说既炫目显眼又极其温柔平和。

他所描述的基督形象,是他用开悟的眼睛所看到的。他所看到基督的形象完全被世人扭曲了,与基督的本性截然相反。我也有同感,我出生在一个信奉新教的基督教家庭,我对基督徒的行为感到震惊,不禁要问:这些是基督徒吗?他提出的观点非常清楚,你能很好理解。有些人的温和只是矫揉造作。 “我很抱歉”“我恐怕...”“我猜...”。看看这些。我们经常使用这种语言。布莱克说,基督不是那种绅士。我也常常说:我不是在作竞选,不是在讨好你们,我来是让你们取悦自己,享受自己,享受并彰显自己所有的财富。他也正是如此将基督的形象呈现在你们面前,基督不是那种绅士,基督不会四处造访,表面上对人极其温和友善,矫揉造作。但基督对那些地位低下的人很温和,祂在渔夫身上建立了神性,可以说他们绝对是普通的、没有受过教育,处在社会最底层的人。基督把他们拣选出来,让他们成为圣人。基督并没有去找那些部长、总理和州长,祂没有。你们看那些大人物,本该负责照管人们神性的信仰部分,却只是忙于拜见州长、国王和王后,向他们鞠躬礼拜。他们只是政治活跃份子。

一个神圣的人,怎会卷入人类所制造的混乱政治中呢?但是我们都不明白这点,因为我们试图将一切都理性化,幸好布莱克出来批评这种理性,反对知识分子把基督贬低为凡人的所有思想,因为布莱克本身就属于上天,所以能明白基督。布莱克常常受人迫害,有时会陷入情绪低落之中。他也有金钱的问题,他无法说服自己的兄弟姐妹,每个人都试图令他不安。

这样一个优美的灵魂来到世上谈论耶路撒冷。他所说的耶路撒冷是什么意思?耶路撒冷是什么?我们去耶路撒冷朝圣,为什么?因为基督在那里出生。当基督能在这里降生时,英国也将成为耶路撒冷。但如今,有多少英国人关心灵性(spirit)?英语本身就是一门滑稽的语言,你们用spirit这个词来代表喝酒,把酒精称为spirit,把四处游荡的亡灵称为spirit,这里还有更多(类似的)。而spirit代表真我atma。当他来到这个世上,工业革命还在进行中。人们仍会进入到他所说的那些“工厂(译者注1)”,他看到文士(译者注2)的所作所为,他看到整个宗教的幻相。他不知道所有的宗教在每一处都在做相同荒谬的事,并不仅仅是基督教。你去任何一个国家,会看到每个宗教都一派胡言。这与先知们告诉他们的,与降世神祇告诉他们的,与所有伟大的圣人告诉他们的完全相反。

虽然不仅只有基督教才这样,但依然没人能够原谅基督教。因为基督教有特别的虔诚,有特殊的角色作用,有种特殊的含义,这也是布莱克想说的,即摩西来到这个世上制定了道德、行为规范。他也描述弥尔顿,说弥尔顿描写的神祗是高高在上的,一个清教徒式的神祗。而布莱克则描绘神圣的人性。他也描绘基督,来到这个世上是为了解放人类,而不是告诉人类“不要做这,不要做那”。起初制定法典这种方式在摩西时代是可行的,布莱克称之为“道德的”基督教,这意味着“不道德(的基督教)”也一定存在。因为在现代这个时候,,如果你通过相应的法律和规则强迫别人做某事,人类是不可能去遵守的,他们会跌入其它的一些陷阱里。

任何的严厉规则施行在没有得到自觉的人身上,都会使他们产生一些问题。他们起的反应是变成罪犯或变得暴力。这些起反应的状况如今仍持续发酵中,整件事的虚伪暴露无遗。像在印度或任何其它地方,他们会说“你不要执着于金钱,要把钱捐献给教堂,给寺庙,给清真寺,给所有人享用”。在那些日子里,人们以上帝的名义所过的生活并没有成为任何人的榜样,这是为什么像他那样的诗人一次次降生的原因。在黎巴嫩,一个伟大的诗人卡里.纪伯伦降生了,然后在印度我们有那么多类似的诗人,他们抨击社会,抨击知识界的所有这些思想,以及抨击试图束缚他们的宗教观念。因为没有真诚,没有诚意,如果我们是真正意义上诚实的人,那么让我们面对事实,亲眼看看我们要实现什么。

这正是他作为一个诗人,一个杰出诗人出现的原因。他押韵的方式,他所拥有的幽默感,以及他展现的语言之美就象任何诗人应有的一样。在梵语里是这么说的,vakyam rasatmakam kavyam—充满rasats的诗歌;rasats代表精华,从文字中迸发出的精华。如果能做到这一点,那么它的魔力被称为诗歌,而这就是你们在布莱克这个伟大诗人身上发现的。诗歌只有在谈及上天时才伟大,当它谈论的是低俗事物,就会将你带向低俗的事物。几天前我听到一位澳大利亚诗人在浴室唱歌,我非常惊讶,太可怕了,你怎能将歌唱生活的卑贱之物称为诗歌,这样的歌曲会将你带向低俗事物和感官欢娱。但他很明确的说,如果你能理解他所说的,“这些书是为了什么?这是为了从中赚钱.”。那么你如何赚钱呢?通过利用人类的弱点,纵容他们的自我和贪婪。如果所有这些事你都会做,你可以非常巧妙的愚弄他们,他们会感到非常快乐,感觉良好。心想“哦,这是怎样一本好书。”

这个国家曾经也有一些伟大的作家,莎士比亚就是一位高度进化的灵。但你们看到后来情况恶化了,出现了类似海明威这样的作家,我也不知道在萨默塞特毛姆之后,怎么突然这些可怕的像海明威那样的作家一下都出现了,他们的书成了抢手货。我们失去所有的锚定和根基。这种恶化也有好处,它引导着弗洛伊德的路,使他被视为基督一般,所有这些导致了问题的产生。人们这才意识到,为什么有预言书,为什么布莱克是先知。他警告人们将会发生什么,但谁在意呢?他被视为疯子。如果你去疯人院,每个人都会认为你是疯子。这就是疯子看待健全人的方式。他的智慧受到责难,人们认为他产生了幻觉,认为他胡说八道,因为他们没有脑子去理解,他们没有开悟,他们感知不到,这是他们那样对待他的原因。现在他死了,当然他们会兜售他的书,赚取暴利,卖他画的盘子,但当他活着的时候,没有人在意他。现在他们可以随心所欲地利用他了。

我在这里遇见过一些人,从他们对布莱克表现出极大兴趣的方式来看,非常可笑。他们说“布莱克说裸女是最美的。”我说:“在哪里说,他怎么可能说这样的话?”他是纯真的人!现在我们也不理解他的纯真是什么。就像默根迪亚如孩童般描述他的母亲,她的乳房以及一切,一个小孩不会在裸体上看到性,他看不到。布莱克描述的是一个女性的美。“这意味着现在到处都行走着裸露的女人”(他们说道)。你是在激发人们的纯真,还是刺激人们的卑劣本性?“我们必须自然”,你是自然的吗?

所有这些反常和分化的出现是因为人没有一个简单的头脑,却带着奸诈。这种奸诈必须从思想上消失。这是非常重要的,但如果我这么说,我就不是在做我的工作,我知道。我很清楚这绝对不是解决问题的方法。这就是基督为什么说那句话“宽恕,宽恕他们”。否则神怎么可能会见这种“奸诈”的、极为狡猾的人类呢,没有宽恕,神怎么可能接触人类?如果基督听了摩西的话,祂不可能接触人类,对吗?祂不可能。如果祂要走向人类,祂不得不宽恕,霎哈嘉瑜伽的初期就是这样的。我们说“你必须宽恕每个人,你要宽恕你自己,不要有罪疚感。”而现在基督教恰恰背道而驰,让我们面对这些,你自己要知道,你不得不去向神父忏悔。神父也因你的忏悔而变疯,你早已疯了。在宽恕的海洋中有什么可以忏悔的?只是消融。

基督给我们传达的信息多么重要,我们所拥有最强大的武器是宽恕别人,宽恕自己。因为神宽恕我们,这是我们必须要明白的信息,我们要宽恕自己。而不是对我们所有犯的错,对所有我们做了违背灵体的事,而心怀罪疚。尤其是如果你们被这样教导,“你最好有罪疚感”,那你们就会总是感到罪疚,左喉轮总是堵塞,以致于在西方我无论去到哪里,我都要告诉他们:“首先你们只要说一句口诀:母亲,我没有罪疚感。”摆脱它!当神那么爱你时,你凭什么感到罪疚?祂把你塑造成进化的典范,你在最高点,为什么你要审判你自己而感到罪疚?是祂没有能力宽恕你?你对祂爱的海洋没有信心?而这些正是以基督的名义所犯错误的根本。我要告诉牧师,现在这里谁才是牧师,来自神学院的人?你能否在神学院里学到神性?基督去过任何一所神学院吗?祂是怎么得到神性的,祂是怎么得到知识的?通过开悟,必须要有开悟。祂清晰的将这一切都说了出来,这种方式没有人喜欢,因为有既得利益者。每个人都有既得利益。没有人是真诚的,诚实的,他们想剥削别人而赚钱。你不能以神的名义来赚钱,这是犯罪!这样的人永远不可能进入神的国度。这是基督为什么说“你会一直称我基督,基督,但我不会承认你”,这是事实。

而如果你是一个真实的人,只是一个真实的人,就不要对此感到罪疚。不要觉得你犯了罪。印度有个小故事 ,一个传教士去到一个村庄,印度乡村的人非常质朴,你知道他们没有那么复杂。因此当他离开时,他们大肆赞美他“神父,非常感谢你告诉了我们什么是罪恶,我们是罪人。”他们不知道他们在犯罪。这也是布莱克给我们展现的一个点,即基督带来了摩西没有传达过的新信息。当然在犹太人不得不奋起的那个时候需要摩西,正是他们需要律法的时候,摩西带来了这些沙里亚律法。这是由摩西创制的,而穆斯林一直遵循着。现在我们处在二十世纪,我们坐在这里,必须要理解这个伟大的人威廉.布莱克的预言。你能想象到吗,他的生日在这个月,导师那纳克的生日在这个月,穆罕默德的生日在这个月,所有这些伟大的人都在这个月出生。我们也要在这个月庆祝光明节。这是一个如此了不起的月份,在这个月出生的这些人是伟大的人。

在对布莱克的整个理解中,我看到的是一个孤独的人在这片土地播种着智慧的种子。我在这里只是为了收获。布莱克是播种者、灌溉者,你可以说莎士比亚为他做了准备;你们这里有许多伟大的诗人,华兹华斯确实是另一个有魅力、出色的人。我想华兹华斯一定是看到了威廉.布莱克的命运,他说最好还是描绘大自然,忘掉人类吧;他一定考虑过,认为在这个不可救药的地方他不可能播种任何东西。但无论怎样,布莱克所做的是给予你一个新的视野和新的理念。因为在西方,基督被抑贬为普通的凡人。他们对基督的描绘,令我感到震惊。他们从哪里获得这个形象?他们到底有没有眼睛?还是他们眼盲了,要这样说祂?你们的主教、大主教都这样说。他们对神毫无敬畏吗?如果你们这样评论基督,这个国家会发生什么?现在有些绘画和电影,把基督描绘成毫无道德的人,把祂的母亲描绘为赤身裸体的,没有任何尊敬。就算布莱克,我不知道你们是否留意到,他把人画成赤裸的,但神不会是赤裸的,他从来不会以那种方式来画神祇,那是一种尊重。而我们,当代了不起的知识分子,玩着各种把戏,这只会让上天降怒于我们。

关于他的第二点是,布莱克是个印刷工,为什么他要做个印刷工呢?为什么布莱克喜欢画画?他曾亲自描绘过书籍是在地狱中产生的,他也描述过我们如何在每一个轮穴中制造出一个魔怪,然后把它们放在图书馆中。这也是我自己非常反对书籍的原因。但他为什么要做个印刷工呢?这点很重要,我们需要知道。为什么他写了那么多关于印刷的东西呢?你们看今日的媒体,这便是布莱克所说的魔怪。那些媒体完全毁了你们,相信我,它们只是为了赚你们的钱,利用你们的弱点,使你们和你们的子女变得越来越弱,社会正在受到彻底、系统地摧毁。布莱克希望打击这些传媒,因此他才降世并成为印刷工,他可以降世为任何身份。在英国或者其他任何地方,没有诗人是印刷工。只有布莱克是这样。原因是他要揭露这个媒体并从根源处去斩断它们。不论我们是否喜欢,邪恶力量正日渐壮大。我们无法明白,今日的传媒对我们的根基,对我们的信仰,对我们所有崇高而正直的理想摧毁到了什么程度。

我自己曾被你们电视工作人员邀请作访谈。我很惊讶,他们说盎格鲁撒克逊人的头脑——神才知道谁制造了这个脑袋,无法明白与钱无关的事情。我说你们先要得到自觉,否则我便不来参加你的节目。

你可以从基督的受难里看到胜利的骄傲。他不在乎,他本可以跪下求情,就像我们的政客一样,从早到晚,四处奔波。祂本可以跑到文士和法利赛人(译者注3)那里请求“哦,请宽恕我,我一生都会服侍你,我可以出卖一切。”。祂不会接受贿赂,祂带着胜利的骄傲走上十字架,但这说明了什么呢?这说明了什么?我们这些愚蠢的人把一个伟大的人钉在十字架上,如今我们可以不再把祂钉在十字架上吗?

因此我说布莱克是个伟大的先知,他预言道:如果你不选择正确的道路,如果你不选择更高的追求,所有这些都会显示出来。我们现在必须理解,因为这是关系到我们的,是要发生在我们身上的,要发生在我们的子女、我们的家庭、我们的社会以及我们的国家之中的。让我们勇敢面对并明白,对于那些可怕的、充满怒火的、对灵性没有任何理解力的心灵来说,上天的慈悲是没有效用的。

霎哈嘉瑜伽很久以前已来到世上,远在我降世以前就已来到。如今它来到英国,应该说是在12年前我来到这里的时候。布莱克花了十四年时间写出耶路撒冷诗篇,我想如果也在十四年后,在这片他希望建立耶路撒冷之地,能对他做出一些公正的评价,我真的为此感到满足,我将对你们所有人感激不尽。

但现实并非如此,令人非常失望。人们什么都不想听,他们只听自己想听的。你不得不利用他们的弱点,一直要告诉他们:无论你做错了什么,都是好事情,继续吧。基督的爱与慈悲可以成就奇迹,这毫无疑问,事情可以成就,因为基督是为我们而来,整个宇宙为我们而创造。我们要去接受上天所有的祝福,我们都要成为灵,就像他所说的:“你们将获得重生。”但从历史,环境、氛围等等而来的这些精微的制约深深地束缚着我们,但是我们没有认识到,也没有意识到,我们必须向上看。

我觉得布莱克的一生是另一次受难,当我阅读他(的作品),有时会泪流不已。真是伟大天父的好儿子啊!布莱克说基督不为祂的父母烦恼,十二岁那年便离开家。结果现在十二岁的儿童都离家出走跑去吸毒,这是我们向他致敬的最好方式,从家里跑出去吸毒,因为基督12岁时离开家。布莱克说:“这是我天父的事业,”他这么写道。“我为什么要担心我的父母?”那不是说你们不要尊重父母,而是:“我正进行更高的寻求,我有更高的寻求,我要转向另一个方向,你们已经朝着这个方向生活了,无论你们怎样平衡了生活,而我必须升进。”显然,这是他要展示在你们面前的讯息,非常显尔易见、清晰明确。无论他表现得多么炽烈,多么有同情心,多么温柔,多么谦逊,核心只有一个:取得你们的升进;变成更高的存有;成为那样(的人)。他在英国这里为我们打下基础。正如我多次跟你们说过的那样,英国是宇宙很重要的一个部分,我不知道有多少英国人清楚,英国是宇宙的心脏。它很小却那么重要。

但我们从心脏这里得到了什么?我们的心里有什么?种族歧视。如果基督今天来这里,你们会向祂扔石头因为祂不是英国人,还是你们相信祂就是英国人?

我们得到了什么?我们不爱自己的孩子 ,我们杀害我们的孩子,我们虐待他们。你们正坐在宇宙的中心,这是宇宙的心脏,你们要给这个世界什么?是灵。灵存在于你的心中,这就是为什么布莱克说英国必须成为耶路撒冷。因为英国是(宇宙的)心脏。意思是灵要来到宇宙的注意力之中,否则事情便不能成就。但它将从何处而来呢?这个灵,将在哪里得到唤醒呢?灵将在人类中得到唤醒,而那些在心脏处的人类在哪里呢?他们住在哪里 ?就算是移民来到这里的人,他们也迷失了,一点用处都没有。而那些土生土长的人都早已昏沉怠惰,以致心脏疲弱得无法泵出任何血液。

这心脏曾经是过度活跃,试图给世界留下深刻印象,现在风光过后,跌入低谷。这个心脏要得到唤醒,使整个世界变成灵性的存有。我们知道自己的责任吗?我们理解这一点吗?作为一个属灵的人我们必须扮演什么样的角色?你们现在必须发挥作为一个属灵之人的作用,但我们却没有,而是忙于所有其他无意义的事情而忽略了灵性。我已辛苦工作了十二年,如我所说,我想我需要在这里多呆两年,达十四年,只有那样,我希望可以,也许耶路撒冷在这个国家才开始显露其建成的端倪,你们可以做到,你们是唯一能成就这事情的人,没有其他人能做到,你们被授以这样的资格。上天选择你们出生在这里是有目的的。

但你无法和任何人谈论宗教,他们不讨论宗教。这是怎样的宗教?这种包含了世上所有宗教的宗教;代表你内在的平衡,内心的宁静,给你升进的宗教,我们却不讨论它。出于礼仪,我们可以谈论世上所有的酒鬼和酒吧,但我们无法谈论像宗教这么吓人的事情。宗教是我们内在与生俱来的呀。你在报纸上无法看到任何关于这方面的信息。但出版人已经浓墨重彩地描写了所有的假导师和所有邪恶的人,并让你都可以看到,乃至成千上万的人追随这些荒谬的人,付出金钱,成为乞丐。但他们不想来到实相。为什么,我问自己,为什么有这样的事发生?找任何借口都没有用。这里曾有个人给了你们许多的解释。他说到圣灵,圣灵是什么,你问任何人,(得到的回答是)圣灵是一个真空。

我很惊讶,当问到某位大主教,“你是怎么理解圣灵的?”他说:“我是一个无神论者。”“无神论者?”然后拉宾问他“那你在这里做什么。”他说:“我在做我的工作,就像你一样。”拉宾明白了,然后就沉默了。

他是个无神论者,对圣灵一无所知。圣灵是什么?威廉布莱克说过:“祂驻于你们内在。”我们为什么不找出祂在哪里?为什么我们不想办法去找出来?圣经不能囊括基督,整个宇宙也不能囊括基督。让我们走出去,看看别人是怎样的看法。但我们非常封闭且自负,伟大的人们完全昏沉怠惰的坐在这里。我们没有时间!对此,我们不要去考虑其他人,让我们自己走出去看看。圣灵是什么,非常简单:圣灵是灵量。看,你使用逻辑而不是理性,这是不同的。如果你使用逻辑,就会看到我们有神圣的三位一体。我们有全能的神,好吧,我们有圣子和圣灵。你们听说过只有父亲没有母亲的儿子吗?那么圣灵是谁,就是太初母亲。你自然而然地会得出结论,但(圣经里)却不能提及母亲。

这就是布莱克为什么要提到 阿尔比恩(古时用以指不列颠或英格兰)的女儿,因为他知道女性在这个国家受压迫的方式五花八门。梵语里有说“Yatra naryastu pujyante ramante tatra Devata ”,“哪里有女性受到尊崇,哪里就有神祗所驻留”。在她们被尊崇的地方,而她们必须值得被尊重,她们不是妓院的妓女,不是那些赤裸地走在路上,炫耀她们的裸体来刺激低俗人性的女人,而是那些值得被尊重的人,她们住在哪里,神祗就驻留于那里。

女性受到如此大的压迫,以致于任何地方的人都不愿意把神当做女性来谈论。因此,圣灵是种抽象的东西,是一只鸽子。好吧,祂是只鸽子,然后怎么样?祂做了什么,那只鸽子?为什么我们应该得到白鸽的祝福是如此重要?没有人解释,这是一个谜。我们不得不带着谜而生活;一切都是谜,这里的银行制度是个谜,钱去哪里了也是一个谜。它和黑手党有关,那也是一个谜,然后共济会的人组织的瑞士银行也是一个谜。一切都是神秘的,被隐藏着,被搁置一边,“哦,这种事不好说的,只说是海外银行业务就行。”名字倒是起的挺好听。“什么海外银行业务”诸如此类的。我们持续着这种虚伪,我们持续着所有这些错误的观念,“哦,这没问题,那没问题,那个部分没问题。”这是不能原谅的。对于这些狡猾的人怎么宽恕?对于奸诈的人怎么宽恕?对于撒旦怎么宽恕?

我们谈到宽恕时要有明辨力。宽恕是针对那些认为自己犯了罪的人,只是你认为自己犯了罪,如果你不这么想便没有。看看狗,还有老虎,看看所有这些人,如果老虎不得不吃掉牛,它就会去吃;它犯罪了吗?它并不知道什么是罪。“我不知道什么是犯罪,”它会这样说:“我不知道这是一种罪,我只是吃掉它,何罪之有。”

只是一直谴责某人:“你是罪人,你是罪人,你犯了这个罪,你犯了那个罪。”人类,是神的圣殿。他们被极致呵护,带着爱的情感,精心微妙地创造出来,为了什么?这朵莲花已经从幻相的污泥中脱离而出,为了什么?是为了被谴责和糟蹋吗?要受这样的虐待,还是以神的名义?

莲花被创造出来是为了奉献给神的,用它们的芳香去照亮整个世界。正如布莱克所描述,他们是神的诗歌天才。而我们看到人类被剥削,被压制,被压迫等等,就像他说的,有两种人,他给那些想压迫别人、毁灭别人的人起了可怕的名字,他认为现在宗教已经成为两者之间的妥协。而纯真的人、纯朴的人、求道者、好人都在受苦,事实如此。

现在且让我们联合起来,获得自觉,并成为永恒的灵。这是很容易的,因为圣灵,即灵量,就在你们之内。灵量潜藏在三角骨处,可以被唤醒。有些人或许会问:布莱克为什么没有谈到灵量?因为无论他说什么,有谁愿意去听呢?谁愿意去了解他呢?就算今日,我也找不到多少人能了解他。他所呈现的,有谁愿意理会?如果他曾说了更多什么,那也一定会是非常隐晦的。他说:「我一点都不介意。对于那些白痴,我说的话当然显得模糊不清。」他只用过三次「白痴」、但讲过很多次「笨蛋」、「傻瓜」。在我眼中,每一个人都是神的子女,但我知道布莱克为什么这样愤怒。我很了解他。他要在霎哈嘉瑜伽来临以前,給世人以棒喝、以重击来打开他们,使得他们做好准备。

但在对他的批评里,我读到,他们说他不被接受是因为他违逆大众。我也一样,人们不接受我因为我不迎合大众。我必须要讨好他们。难道我是为了得到你们的选票,所以应该讨好你们吗?我必须告诉你们真理,不管你们是否愿意。我想要你们接受真理,因为这是我在这里的原因,就是你们接受并得到真理。我会尽力而为。我可以为你们煮食,我可以给你们美食,我可以给你们礼物,一位母亲能为孩子做的所有一切,我都可以为你们做。而当事情不能成就时,她有时不得不吼叫。

她必须要把事情说得很明白,因为你们必须要得到自觉。现在你不能强迫别人(得自觉),这是最大的问题。你不能强迫别人得自觉,你不能用强迫的方式去进行。象俄国人告诉我,他们对霎哈嘉非常感兴趣,毫无疑问,而如果他们告诉我:“你来我们的政府机关给他们自觉。”我无法做到,你必须是自由的人。当你自由时却恣意放纵,看,我们为自由付出的代价,就是没有人是自由的,如果行走在纽约(街头),我得拿掉所有因家庭(地位)需配戴的首饰。我不能带钱包去那里,我得把钱包藏起来,否则他们会抢劫,没有什么是安全的。

因此这种自由导致暴力、屠杀;事实上我们杀害孩子,杀害长者,侮辱他们每个人的方式,所有这些都与所谓的自由息息相关。这不是自由,这是我们内心那个残酷自我的极端放纵。不管你去俄罗斯还是在这里,霎哈嘉瑜伽都有会问题,不管你是偏左还是偏右,我只是不明白。哪里的人们以智慧和尊重来使用自由,那里的霎哈嘉瑜伽就将繁荣发展。如果你不尊重别人的自由你就完全没有自由,你们从未懂得自由,你们从未享受自由。因此人类的自由必须被尊重。只有这种自由被尊重,你才能得到自觉,你才能进入到更高的自由,进入到布茉克所描述的完全的自由意志。

在这个国家有那么多求道者,而那么多人都迷失了,那么多人都迷失了。有些一直吸食毒品的人被霎哈嘉瑜伽拯救,他们一夜之间就放弃了,一夜之间,如何发生的?这是神在你内在建立的一个机制,当灵的力量启发你,你变得那么强大,你戒了(毒品)。但如果我事先说:“不要这样做,不要那样做。”你们做不到,(因为)你们没有灵的力量。在基督之前的大多数降世神祇没有意识到这一点,即人类没有得到觉醒,他们内在没有灵的力量。基督意识到了,他公开地说:“你要重生。”不仅如此,他还说:“首先要宽恕,谈论宽恕。”这样他们会安定下来,他们不再偏执,他们不再沮丧。让他们在平安和慈悲中安定下来,然后唤醒他们的灵量,让他们得到自觉。

这样你就有力量,就没有诱惑之类的东西存在了。你会用什么试探基督吗。你不能。同样的你摆脱任何诱惑的束缚。你在自己的美丽、荣耀以及力量中升进,你不需要屈服于任何东西。这就是自觉。12年前我来到伦敦,霎哈嘉瑜伽也来到这里。你们要知道,我完全不是为了移民,应该说只是偶然的机会,或者说是上天的安排。我丈夫从134个国家中当选,他被选中,我们来到这里只是因为他被选中,甚至不是指定,而是当选,四次全票当选。他是最高级别的秘书长。因此我们不得不来到这里,这就是我来到这里的原因,否则我可能永远不会来伦敦来传授霎哈嘉瑜伽

对于布莱克,他感到有必要去努力建立耶路撒冷,不管是什么情况,不管有多失望,不管有多厌恶,都没关系。他不得不做。他对英国的土地充满信心:我们必须建立耶路撒冷。但首先,在这里的每个人必须得到自觉,在你的自觉前谦卑下来。你们对此不可妄自尊大。他说基督在人类面前并不谦卑,但在神面前谦卑。在祂的天父面前谦卑。同样,你在你的灵和自觉前要谦卑,你要到达更高的状态。让人惊讶的是在印度,这么多年来我们一直拥有所有这些知识,但我们被认为是异教徒,我不知道他们还叫我们什么。我们被认为是奴隶。没有人想了解这现存的根源知识。我们的知识份子也从来不为此困扰,他们总是追随牛津和剑桥的传统。随着这种对牛津、剑桥的推崇,我们从来没有告诉人们这个在我们国家所具有的伟大知识,一切都沦陷了。

这个知识不是为印度准备的,不是为任何特定的地方准备的,而是要服务全世界的,就像你们的科学知识,所有的知识之树都是要服务全世界的,你们将它给了我们,或者给了所有的东方国家,人们接受了。接受对你有好处的知识有什么害处呢,只是因为它来自东方你感到不安全?基督从何处而来?祂来自美国吗?我想祂一定会逃走的。尽管这样,我必须说在所有(西方国家)当中,英国是最为成熟的。但我们跟着美国人跑,我们跟着法国人跑,我们跟着每个人跑,我们不知道自己是谁,我们是有智慧的人,我们是代表宇宙心脏的人,时光流逝,从布莱克到今天,我们现在要成熟,我希望我们足够成熟去明白必须要有一个突破。

当他们印制我的宣传单时,不知怎么回事我的脸在传单上显得很黑。我说:“完了,没有人会来我的讲座,如果呈现的是这样一张黑皮肤的脸孔他们会说:哦,一个来自非洲的人试图教我们什么是耶路撒冷。”因此他们不得不重新印刷,显得我没那么黑。皮肤颜色深有什么关系呢?颜色来自于心,美丽来自于心,你存在的美丽是通过内心的丰富来表达的,真理的美丽在于,它行动,它工作。它不装饰自己,它不试图用什么方式去引诱人们,而是去行动。不管你是否喜欢,它行动。让我们把它成就出来。这是简单的。不是通过你的大脑进行智力上的工作,进入有限理解的方向,让我们走向无限。这只有当你到达你的灵才有可能,它是无限的,它创造内在的集体意识。它创造,我的意思是,它创造知识,这种知识不是你经由大脑所获知的,而是经由你的中枢神经系统所获知的。你可以感觉到它,你可以在指尖上感觉到每个人的轮穴。默罕穆德说过:“当复活的时候你的手会说话。”但是看看那些穆斯林,他们从来没有谈到过复活,古兰经的大部份内容都是复活。他们谈论的却是世界未日因为他们要通过恐吓人们来赚钱。当心世界未日,你给钱我们就救你,我们会给你一张证书,在世界未日你会凭着证书而得救。在世界未日首先是他们下(地狱)。

每个宗教都是这样,人们为了非常低贱的目的而利用它,赚钱、创建政治思想。我无法理解钻石是怎么像这样被扔到了土里,被掩埋了,芳香变成了污秽。这超出了我的理解。人类的力量有时超过了神的力量,你可以看到人们改变形相的方式,他们改变美丽,将一切实相改变成某种荒谬和愚蠢的东西。他们能忍受,不想探个究竟,他们甚至享受其中。“我们非常快乐,有什么错。”你会感觉这是对创造巨大的浪费,籍由上天何等强烈的渴望和愿景,这些人类才在地球上被创造出来!我们要做些什么让他们明白自己是谁,让他们以上天的这种感知、这种视角来觉知自己到底是谁?有时我也在荒野中哭泣,深切感受到所有那些来到这个世上的诗人的悲痛,他们一直在受苦、受难、受折磨。

带着所有这些悲痛,我希望,不管今天我告诉你们什么,你们要试着去明白,真诚是理解你们自己的唯一方式。没有书籍,没有任何事物,没有制约,没有否定,没有什么可以使你信服。只有真诚地去认识你内在的灵,我把这个真诚称为纯洁的愿望。如果你有这个纯洁的愿望,它是你灵量的力量,你会得到自觉。此刻、就刚才这一刻、灵量启动了,这就是所需要的全部,成为灵的纯洁的愿望,仅此而已。而当它被唤醒后,它需要被照顾,这是非常重要的;必须要被照顾,它必须保持燃烧,它必须被调遣并保持在一个点,至此你开始成长得越来越多。我不需要告诉你们所有关于霎哈嘉的知识,你们会一下子消化不了,而布莱克是如何为我们工作的,那么多诗人都在做这个工作,而现在新兴的了不起的诗人是来终结我们的,他们取悦媒体,赚取钱财,愚弄我们,华丽的词藻,取巧的句子,将我们直接带向地狱。当心他们,要当心,拯救你们的孩子远离他们,拯救整个社区,整个英国要被拯救。因为如果心脏死亡,整个宇宙也会死亡。

愿神祝福你们!

The Sahaja Yogis didn't want Me to allow you to ask Me questions, but I think better ask Me some questions.Q.....about the chakras....

Shri Mataji: Yes sir. That's what I said, that I didn't talk about them because it would be too long a lecture but we have got a book on this, a little book and there it is all written though I say that before realization don't even read that book, can create problems. You can know all about the subtle side, the chakras and everything without paying anything, without any effort. There are people now in England, you will be surprised, so many of them are excellent Sahaja yogis who are experts and they will tell you all about it very clearly. We have got books to explain. As you see there are seven chakras are shown here. The lowermost is the Mooladhara Chakra, is the innocence.

Q:...can you see it with your eyes, outside the body, can you see it?Shri Mataji: If you see something then you are not that. And people have seen it because they were not that, because they moved on the sides, on the sympathetic nervous system, what we call the Ida and Pingala. When you go on sympathetic nervous system you can see it from outside. Like this building you can see it from outside, but when you are in it you don't see it, you see only the inside. So that's what it is, when you ascend, you need not see anything, you become, you get the powers. People have seen it no doubt, but that one should not ask for. I can see the glass - better to drink the water. Now what else?

Q:....what do You do with all Your wealth, all your money?Shri Mataji: My money? Are you from the bank? What I do with My money - what do you want Me to do? What sort of a question is this? Ask a simple straightforward question madam I don't understand what do I do with My money, I don't do anything with it. Actually My husband manages his money, I ask him whatever I like. Of course he earns a lot no doubt, he earns very much. I sometimes tell him, "I'm ashamed the way they give you money," because he doesn't even pay any tax you know. Of course I do spend some money on Sahaja Yoga, I must confess I have to sometimes, what to do? One has to and these people have their own ashrams, where they stay, and look after it. For this hall they must have collected some money I don't know, I don't know what do they do with their money, I don't know, I have no idea, I've never seen that. They are honest people, they all know all about it. I don't know anything, I have nothing to do with it. This is the aggressiveness, "What do I do with My money" Just look at this. Yes sir?

Q....a man has mental illness, he wants to know whether he'll have it after he dies....Shri Mataji: No, no, no, just now you can cure it. Why to think of death? You can be cured of your mental illness at least, minimum, that could be done.

Q....How can you tell that it's Self-realization? You feel a breeze but how does it become...Shri Mataji: You see, when you feel the cool breeze is the beginning of it, all right? Now you have to see what this cool breeze is, all right? Now if you go to a college of science or a college of medicine what you have to do is to see what it is, isn't it; and to see whatever it says does it prove. Now, when you see the cool breeze in your hand, what happens that it is, as I said, is the compassion of God say for example, you just believe in the hypothesis just now. Now what is this compassion doing, is made you a computer. On the fingertips you can tell what centers are catching, of yours and of others, so you become the diagnosis. Now if you know a little few gestures by which you can handle this power, you can cure them. That's the minimum, all right? You can know from this whether you have mental problem or you have emotional problem, or you have physical problem and of what nature. This is how is the self-knowledge starts, from the very basics.

What's your problem with you, first let us see the problem on the centers, all right? Then you move forward when you go with it, then you understand what's the problem with others; then what's the problem in the collective; then what's the problem of this country; and if you know how to solve them, sitting down here, you can do it, you can solve it. But this is the breeze which has to be felt first because this is the breeze which we call as the all-pervading power of God. Now, just because I say you should not believe Me, because blind faith is of no use, but you can experiment and see for yourself. Even little children know. They can tell you what is catching in you, what chakras are catching. You can have ten children, ‘fold' their eyes, put them before a gentleman, immediately they'll raise this finger or this finger. Supposing they raise this finger, means this person feels terribly guilty. He must be a Catholic that he feels so guilty. That the children won't say but you will know that this is the chakra is caught up here because he's feeling guilty.

Like that you can go on finding on your own being like a laboratory the whole thing becomes like a computer because it is knowledge, knowledge through your central nervous system, through your evolutionary process. But you have to practice and understand what it is. If I give you a car, how will you know it moves unless and until you get into it and know how to drive it, isn't it. You have to give some time, not much, but you enjoy, best part of it you enjoy doing the whole thing. It just flows automatically, you don't have to do anything about it.

But one has to learn, little bit, what it is. Before realization you don't have to do anything, it just forms spontaneously as the seed is sown in the Mother Earth, all right? Then when it comes out, then you have to look after it; the same way you have to look after your realization, respect it. Then you become the masters. We have one master standing here and we have so many. They are just like you to look at, but they know so much and they are so humble. They don't go about with a big plate on their heads "I am the master of this and master of that" nothing. They are doing all their jobs, they are doing very well, they are blessed and also they are helping people to get their realization. You'll be surprised in Sahaja Yoga very difficult to get an unemployed person. All of them are employed. If they are unemployed they get employment with God also. Basically they are employed by God. All right?

Q... is this the only way to get realization?Shri Mataji: Yes, of course; there cannot be another, God could not make thousand and one, could He? That would be too much of a headache , like as you sprout the seed, how do you do it? Spontaneously. Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous, living process is always spontaneous. Now supposing we want to sprout a seed and we take out the primule, push it out and push it inside the Mother Earth, will it sprout - no. You have to take advantage of the powers of the Mother Earth, to sprout a seed, isn't it?

Q. ...saying she has not come across Sahaja Yoga in the religions, that there are many religions.Shri Mataji: In the religions there's no ... religions are no religions, that's the trouble is. I have told you all this just now that there is nothing, they will never mention that is sensible, but it's not so. I would say Sikhism, we can say is the latest religion. I mean there are so many verses about, much later than Islam, Sikhism came on this earth and they have said that, complete description, I mean you don't understand Hindi otherwise I would have told you - Ida, Pingala, Sushumna - everything they have described - Kabira has described at such length that we have in India a great poet Gyaneshwara and He has described all about kundalini. If you go in Maharashtra and tell them that somebody is going to awaken the kundalini, they'll all rush, they know all about it.

How many years did Christ live? How many times He could talk to people? How many of them accepted Him and how many of them understood Him? He went to a wrong place, I tell you; all were deaf, dumb and brainless. How will they understand? How could He talk about Kundalini when everybody was after His life? But He did talk of Holy Ghost, He talked of the Comforter He was going to send. He talked of so many things in that short time. Do you know for four years I was struggling with seven hippies in London; for four years. I must say, it's very creditable for Him in three and a half years to talk so much. How many years Blake had to work hard to talk to you? Is it easy to talk to people about truth? Very difficult; everybody is extremely intelligent and wise, nobody want to listen to anything, do they? But in India we have a tradition; we know it; that you have to ascend. The whole thing works out that way. If they talk of kundalini, not in the North so much, but in Maharashtra, if you go, if you go in the South, you'll be amazed six thousand people, seven thousand people come in a village. They have seen it, these people have seen it, they come in bullock carts, they come in, any way that is possible for them, buses, and trains, and they walk miles together when they hear I'm there.

Once I was coming from a program in the night and suddenly I found lots of people lying on the road. I said, "Who are these people?" They said, "Mother we couldn't reach Your program, we were late, You give us realization here." I said: "All right, have it." They had it, they are the ones who'll get much faster than anyone else, I know, that's why I don't mind spending some time here. Once I go there, you will see the whole country would be ablaze, I'm not telling you lies, you ask the people who have been there. They are very different type of people, to them most important is their spirit. If you tell them what, the way we talk about Christ here, so disrespectfully, without understanding, they are shocked. Any Indian who is a Christian or a Muslim or a Hindu, doesn't treat the way you treat Bible. The respect they have has come to them traditionally. Of course you don't judge Indians by the Indians who have come here. They like your company, they are this type, they are materialistic, they want to have money, they have come here to earn money, but the people who are in India in the villages, not in the cities, are still seeking, seeking God, they're very simple people, humble people.

Traditionally we have known for thousands of years. I talk of Markandeya who was there twelve thousand years back, who incarnated here as William Blake. Twelve thousand years back He said the same thing which is said in England after twelve thousand years, because that time I don't know what was here, may be only jungles, I think. And that is also waste, isn't it, tell Me, isn't it? How much could Christ talk about kundalini? He talked of Holy Ghost. But why stick on to that, now I have come to talk to you. Better take your realization; when He came, they talked of Moses, when Moses came they talked of Abraham. What about the present, I am with you, why not have your realization? All religions were built for this day, that you get your realization, to give you the balance, to give you that property by which you ascend. Like when we have an aeroplane, we fix it up properly; in the same way they wanted to fix you up, but the religions went astray, they made people crooked, the things they fixed, wrong bolts into wrong places, the whole aeroplane is in a tattered condition if it flies, it will all fall down. Better give up all those ideas. But kundalini is such a great force, it's such a great force; it comforts you, it cures you, it builds up all your centers and slowly moves upward and when if you get realization, also it goes back, attends to all these problems that you have. It's such a mother she is. Any other question, please?

Q. Why are you to be known as Mataji, Mother?Shri Mataji: I didn't follow.Yogi: Nor did I. Why are You to be known as Mataji?Shri Mataji: As Shri Mataji? That's the title they gave Me, what can I do? In India. You have to be an Indian to understand that. There are certain things described, about Shri Mataji. If you have read any books, of Adi Shankaracharya, or of Markandeya Himself, then you will know and the qualities described there of such a person, if they find it in someone, they call that person by that name, isn't it? Like Gandhiji was called as Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma means a bigger spirit than others, because he had that. He didn't care for himself or his own family, everything for his own, but he thought of the whole country; that's why he was called Mahatma. Now, but I didn't call Myself; if others want to call I think is all right, I have no objection. You can call anything, whatever you see, you can call that. By calling that, what is your objection? Can I ask you this question? Beg pardon? [No objection] No objection. All right, that's all right. See, then it's all right, if you understand that it is must be some reason also.(Further question from same person)

Q. Do you have some divine power?Shri Mataji: That you better find out; I am not going to be tactless on that. Christ said what was the truth, that He was the Son of God, all right, but they crucified Him. I don't want to get crucified so soon.

[INAUDIBLE Q:] But the one who is an Indian, who is an Indian and Englishman. [Hindi]. You see it is for an ... Indians understand it better. [Hindi]I'm sorry I'm speaking in Hindi because I have to little bit chastise the Indians here, I hope you don't mind. [Hindi]

Now, what is another question please? Yes please?

Q. Yogi: Mother, she is asking if you can cure physical ailment, I mean the answer's yes, that comes from Self-realization, no question.Shri Mataji with your permission, the majority of people have come for the experience and are anxious to have, I may be mistaken, but I think most people would like to stop questions and ...

Shri Mataji: But sometimes you know those who want to ask, let them ask, otherwise the brain will again put out a question. Now madam, what is it..?

(SY. She's asking You, Mother, what life was like for You as a child)?Shri Mataji: As a child? I mean that's another story; you come and see Me, I'll tell you all about it. Why do you want to know about My past and future? Let us at the present time to get your realization; makes no difference what I was as a child, or what I was as an old woman.

Yogi: ... She's asking whether you have an opinion about the growth of interest in spirituality in England...Shri Mataji: What spirituality?Yogi asks questioner: spiritualism or spirituality? Questioner answers: spiritualism.Shri Mataji: That's the witchcraft, revived; very, very dangerous. Ah, is very dangerous, never go near that, all this parapsychology and all those things. We have described all these things in our book; you can have a look at it. Is a very comprehensive thing, Sahaja Yoga is. Is the witchcraft, you may call it spirituality, because a spirit can be also a dead soul as I told you, in English language. There is no ‘ism' about God. It's infinite. ‘Isms' are all finite things.

Q. SY: she's praising Your lecture, Mother, and saying now that....she'll go back to read Blake again.Shri Mataji: I'm very happy, I'm very happy that you say that, madam, it's really such a great poet, but you'll be surprised in India, none of them brought Blake. We never read Blake there, never; you see we studied English language, we studied Shakespeare, we studied so many things, but never they mentioned Blake, you know. I don't know why. In the whole education system of India, they never mentioned Blake.

[another inaudible question ...]

Shri Mataji: That's very nice, such books you must read. Such books you must read.[Here someone disclaims in Sanskrit]You see there's a Sanskrit scholar here, but the greatest Guru is the Mother, don't you think so? The Mother is the Guru of the gurus. But it's very difficult, because guru is a hard stuff, you see. A mother has to be very soft, kind, gentle to manage the show, but the guru can be very hard and they are very hard people, but Mother as a guru is a difficult task, it's very enjoyable.

Now I have given at least eleven lectures on Guru tattwa, all right? So you can take tapes from them, you can read it and you will enjoy it very well. Here the Guru tattwa is expressed in the Void, there, where the ten Gurus actually incarnated basically and they reincarnated. Say we can start from Adi Nath, then we can come to other ones like Nanaka, Janaka. Janaka was much earlier, then we can say Abraham, Moses. All these were Guru tattwa, Socrates, all these were Guru tattwa people, the people who came as Prophets; the ones who came on this earth to teach us balance, to teach us the code of life. That was also important part, but that was forgot. Why? Why the code, why the religion? Religion is for the ascent, to build you up.

Q. ?TattwaShri Mataji: Tattwam assi, that's what is the tattwa there; tattwa is there; tattwa is nothing but your kundalini is your tattwa, is the principle....

Q: [INAUDIBLE] Parvati, Shiva; She's also called as Kundalini.Shri Mataji: Of course. Yes, yes, it is all over, same thing. I'm just giving you the gist of it.

SY: She's asking, Mother, who was Mother Durga, she's asking about who was Mother Durga?Shri Mataji: A very direct question; I told you, I'm very tactful, I'm not going to confess anything. You better find out, it's better to find out. It's nice, isn't it? To find out yourself.

Yogi: ...I'll explain, Mother, the program is that tonight will be the experience of realization and we have another program on Saturday evening, here in the same place, which will be for this knowledge part; after realization, the knowledge makes more sense, so it's better to get the experience...Shri Mataji: But our experience is very funny, I must tell you that for My program, even if there may be one thousand people, for getting realization, after that they just get lost, never grow. That's only more in England, they just don't ... they'll get lost, I think they must be going to the pub after that. I can't explain why it happens but they just get lost, they don't want to know anything anymore. I don't know why, I cannot explain, I mean, is something I cannot explain. All right, let's have it now.

So now, if we are all settled down, it's very simple, Sahaj also means simple, Sahaj; saha means ‘with' ja means ‘born'; is born with you, this right to get this union, this yoga, is born with you, is within you and is the living process of the living God so it is spontaneous. Everything that is living is spontaneous and should happen to all of you, no doubt about it. You don't have to do anything as I said but you have to receive the power within yourself, to invite the kundalini to rise. Now first thing I have to request, I hope it is not too much of it, that we have to take out our shoes to touch the Mother Earth. Is very important because the Mother Earth is the one which sucks in, for a while. I don't know, is there a carpet there? Be in a mood of reception, and also of well-being, in a happy mood, because this is the greatest moment of our lives.

Now as I said that these fingers, here five, six and seven, on the same way this way, represent the two sides of the chakras within us, the sympathetic sides, so we have to put our hands like this, just like this, simple as that. And sit, not crossed legged but putting both the feet with respect, towards the Mother Earth, in parallel to each other. Now maybe some of you must have started feeling the cool breeze, I don't know, might have, because today's lecture was rather too terrific and William Blake must have worked it out I'm sure. But otherwise is very simple. Now we have to do is to ourselves awaken our own kundalini, which is very simple, which I will tell you. In the heart resides the spirit so first we'll have to put our hand to our heart. I will tell you one by one. And then in the upper part of your stomach where the guru tattwa is here, the principle of guru is there. Then in the lower part of the abdomen, where it is the divine, or we can say the pure knowledge that exists and which works. This is the center through which the pure knowledge, the pure technique, works. Then we take this hand again back, same way, up to this point where, it is here, when we are guilty we catch this chakra. Now here works our self-confidence, our faith in God that He forgives us. Then we put our hand on top of our head - this is the Agnya Chakra, which is very important. Here we forgive everyone; then at the back of the Agnya Chakra again, where we have to say that, "If we done any mistake, oh God forgive us". These are the two sides of the Agnya Chakra. And then you put your hand, stretch it, put this part on the fontanel bone area, the soft bone which was on top of our head and press it hard and move it hard, for a while. That's all one has to do. I'll tell you one by one.

First and foremost thing is, we have to close our eyes, because eyes take out our attention; but attention will be sucked inside our body in the sense it will go through the - just like this cloth - it is spread out, but as kundalini rises, She sucks it in and then pierces through this attention, enlight[en]ing all of that. It's a happening that takes place without any trouble whatsoever. As a result of that, what you get is the cool breeze coming out of your head; you can also feel the cool breeze in your fingertips; then later on in your hands and you get that shine on your skin. Christ has said, "The face that does not shine cannot become the star." And then you get that glint of shine of the spirit in your eyes. That's all, is not the point, is much, much, much, much more but just a wee bit that we have to today testify and later on to find out have we got realization all right, then can we work it out, can we do this, because later on we have to play our role now as a spiritual being, that's the point one has to understand.

So now, have respect for yourself first of all; and not to feel guilty at all. You are the temple of God, really believe Me you are made that way, only the light is to be kindled and that is in your heart. When the kundalini rises, she's something like an energy that does that because when she pierces through, this is the place where the God Almighty resides, who is reflected in our heart as the spirit and the all-pervading power, which is the Primordial Mother, the Holy Ghost, this vibrations that you feel, the power of God, the love of God which is represented within us as the kundalini, rises and unites us, our attention to the Divine. The spirit enlightens the attention and by that enlightenment you know, on your fingertips, on your central nervous system, through your new collective consciousness about yourself and about others. Through Sahaja Yoga you know how to cure, improve, and through this happening, through the spirit you enjoy because spirit - the nature of spirit is satchidanand, means it is the truth, it becomes the attention and it is the source of joy. Without getting realization you can be happy and unhappy but you cannot be joy, which has no dualism. You become the source of joy. Such a person, when he meets someone; he sees someone, he looks at someone, just a kataksh is sufficient to raise the kundalini - just a glance is sufficient to cure that person; just a thought, can give comfort to the other person. Miracles after miracles, so many miracles that as Sahaja yogis say, "miracle' has lost its meaning Mother, in Sahaja Yoga," that's true. So miracles of miracles and every moment you feel that God is looking after you.

When this great volcano burst, exploded in Mexico, a miracle happened they say, that the children were saved. The wrath - no this was not in Mexico but later on more in Colombia, because Colombia is sending all kinds of these horrible things all over the world, making money out of it. The wrath of the Mother Earth poured that mud and the people were drowned but the children survived. Their heads were above the mud, the body inside the mud. The same Mother Earth looked after them because they should not be burned so She covered them with the mud, why? Because of the innocence in them. Those who have even the slightest innocence in them will become realized souls, no doubt about it - slightest, a very wee bit. All the seekers are a special category of people and they have to become realized souls.

So forget about the past, forget whatever you have done in your seeking, whatever you are told, whatever you are branded with, just forget it and forgive yourself, once for all. This is I am telling you this because this is one of the biggest problems of the West that everybody sits down with a bad, horrible trouble here and sometimes I feel it so much that I can't even hear people. Is terrible. This portion is so bad here so I have to request you that please forgive yourself. You are the glory of God, without you God has no meaning also. It is He who is anxious, much more then you are, to give you realization. Just help Him out a little.

All right. Let us see. So we put our both the hands like this, close our eyes. Now you have to keep the left hand all the time towards Me, because is the desire, is expressed through it is the power of desire in the left hand which expresses that you want to have realization. The right hand is the power of action so you move your right hand but don't open your eyes. You have to keep your eyes all the time shut, just the opposite of mesmerism as you can see. Now please close your eyes; now put your right hand on your heart.

Now here you have to say, or ask Me a question, "Mother am I the spirit?" You may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever suits you. "Mother am I the spirit?" is a fundamental question and if you are a computer it will answer. "Mother am I the spirit?" Ask the question three times please. Put your left hand properly, please close your eyes; everybody should do it, please. It's uncivil not to close your eyes; please close your eyes because others may feel self-conscious so please close your eyes, to be courteous.

Now you have to take down your right hand on the upper part of your stomach, on the left hand side, we are working only on the left hand side. Here is the principle of the master. If you are the spirit, automatically you have to ask the second question, "Mother am I my own master? Mother am I my own guru?" Please ask this question, you have to ask this question three times again, without fear, with all confidence you ask this question, you are the spirit, you are your master.

Now move your right hand on the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side, lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of the divine work, of the divine knowledge or the pure knowledge, of the technique of divine manifestation. At this point I cannot force you to do anything, as I told you, you have to be free, I can only request you and here I say that you have to ask for the divine knowledge, you have to ask for the pure knowledge and when you ask for it the kundalini will start moving. Here with sincere heart, in a humble way you have to say, "Mother may I have the pure knowledge, Mother may I have the divine technique?" Ask this question six times because this center has got six petals.

Now to make the way easy for kundalini, we go along the same centers upwards so you put your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen, to make it easy for the kundalini to rise you have to open this center by asserting, by saying "Mother I am my own master", by saying "Mother I am my own master", ten times because there are ten petals, ten Sat gurus basically who incarnate ten times, of Prophets, the Masters.

Now raise your right hand on your heart, press it. With the same confidence you have to say twelve times "Mother I am the spirit, I am the spirit, I am the spirit". Just assert, that's a fact, that's the truth. Press it with your fingers. Now, twelve times, have full confidence in you, believe Me you are the spirit, you have to just become in the sense it has to come in your attention on to your central nervous system.

Now raise the right hand on the left hand side of your neck, in the corner where the neck and the shoulder meet, press it hard, take it backwards, press it hard. This is the most difficult center in the West, as I told you, that we feel guilty all the time but as I have told you, God is the ocean of love, ocean of compassion, but above all He is the ocean of forgiveness. He's the ocean of forgiveness. When He's the ocean of forgiveness, what guilt can we have that He cannot wash away or dissolve it? So just you have to say sixteen times because there are sixteen petals, to say sixteen times with full belief in yourself, "Mother I'm not guilty, Mother, I'm not guilty, Mother, I'm not guilty" sixteen times will you please say that "Shri Mataji I'm not guilty". If you still feel you are guilty and you can't forgive yourself, better say it to punish yourself hundred and eight times, if that pleases you.

When you forgive yourself you have to forgive others and so the greatest message of Christ, that we have to forgive others you have to put your hand to the center which is the adornment or we should say which adorns Christ, on the Agnya Chakra on your forehead, please put your right hand across,. Press it hard and here you have to say with full belief in yourself and in your powers that, "Shri Mataji I forgive everyone". Some may say that's very difficult but what do we do when we forgive or not forgive - no logic in it. But when we say that, then we are out of the clutches of other people, so please say, "Shri Mataji I forgive everyone. Now say it with your whole heart, how many times is not the point, please say it with your whole heart. Now you move your hand backwards onto the back side of the same center - Agnya - press it hard. Now here, you have to say once only without feeling guilty at all, without feeling no remorse, no condemnation, to God, one for your satisfaction, "Oh Lord, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me" but don't feel guilty, that's very important. Even without saying He has forgiven you. Better.

Now raise your right hand on top of your head, stretch your ... stretch your palm, press it hard on the fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone in your childhood, press it hard, move it seven times. Again here I cannot force anything on you. You have to say that you want your Self-realization that, "Mother, please give us our realization. We want our Self-realization. Please give me my Self-realization" and press it hard and move it seven times and say that. I'm sure it will work out.

Now bring down your hand, slowly, and bend your head a little bit and feel with your left hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Try to bend your head a little, little bit and about four inches above the head, bend it a little, that works out better sometimes. With your left hand, right hand towards Me and with the left hand you see the breeze. Right hand towards Me and then with the left hand you see, you can feel it better, with the left hand on top of your head; first with the left hand. Aah. Now put the left hand towards Me and with the right hand just see if it is blowing because it should come in both the hands. Open your eyes, open slowly and watch Me without thinking. Let us see if you can do it - just without thinking, just watch Me, without thinking. There's no thought in your mind, no thought. Now just put your hands like this, are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

Now put your hands up in the air, like this, and in your heart ask a question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Ask the question, put it up nicely, ask the question three times: "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the brahma shakti? Is this the all-pervading power of God? Ask the question. Now put down your hands and see for yourself if you feel the cool breeze. All those who have felt the cool breeze on the head, coming out of the head, or on their fingertips or in the hands please raise your hands, both the hands. That's Blake. You all have become Blake. May God bless you.

So many. May God bless you. But I must warn you, after this don't talk about it because it is beyond reasoning. Secondly you must come back, must all of you come back and work it out. Those who haven't got realization will also receive it. Those who have got it, will establish it. Please come back. You will enjoy the silence, the stillness within. But that's just the beginning of it. We have to go further. Otherwise you won't be able to manifest it properly. It has to be looked after. It's just a shoot that has come out, a little shoot we have to look after it. May God bless you all. Thank-you very much. Why not sing Jerusalem to them ... will be good idea.
