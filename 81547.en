When I admitted, "Yes, I can feel the vibrations," Mother said, "In that case, you can come with me to the airport. You can come in my car." So, great, I'll go to the airport with Mother. As Mother entered the car, everybody got in, and then I was just getting inside when the dog jumped in and took my place, sitting next to Mother. A big dog. That's where I was supposed to sit.

Mother takes the dog by the collar and starts pushing it out of the car. The dog growled at her hand. Mother pushed the dog again, and the dog growled again. Then she looked at me. "Well, Luis, you see, I tried. I did my best. The thing is that this dog has also recognized me. There's nothing I can do. Why don't you take the bus?"

So I went to the bus stop. I arrived, and I didn't have any money. My motorbike had run out of petrol miles away. I really felt stupid, waiting for the bus without any money to go to the airport. But that's what Mother told me to do. Suddenly, another Sahaja Yogi comes along. I knew them. "Oh my God, this is the solution. Have you got a bit of spare change? I need to go to the airport." They looked in their pockets. "Good gracious, I don't even have enough to go on the bus myself."

"Okay, well, what shall we do?"

"Well, Mother told you to go by bus. You go by bus." Okay, fine. I waited a bit longer. A third Sahaja Yogi comes. "Have you got a bit of spare money?" They checked their pockets. "Good gracious, I don't have enough money for myself either." Three Sahaja Yogis now, if you count me, all waiting for the bus to go to the airport without money. I thought, "This is mad. We need to do something about it." They told me, "Oh no, in Sahaj, this is not how it works. You don't worry about things. Just give it a bandhan."

"Really? And that's how you go on the bus without money?"

"Yes, you just give it a bandhan." All right, I gave it a bandhan.

Suddenly, one of the yogis sees a taxi passing through. "I know that guy!" He stops the taxi. "This guy is a good friend of my brother," he said. "Okay, let's get in. We are lucky. What a miracle." We get in the taxi, and they start talking. Oh my God, it was not the friend of his brother. It just looked like him. In Portugal, the taxi drivers usually have a cricket bat under the seat, so I thought, "We are going to die. One of us is going to die today." They said, "Oh no, in Sahaj, this is not how you do things. You just give it a bandhan."

"Really?" So we gave lots of bandhans.

We had waited about 40 minutes at the bus stop—first me, then another yogi, then another, then the taxi. We must have started about 40 minutes after Mother. We are going to our death now. "One of us is going to die today," I thought. We arrived at the airport. "Now what are we going to say? Shall we all run away, each one in a different direction? One of us might escape."

"No, no, no, we just give it a bandhan. We have to have faith." We gave it another bandhan. The taxi stops. We look at the car next to us. It was Shri Mataji's car. Inside the car was a very rich doctor, and he paid for the taxi. It was a close brush with death again.

At the airport, Shri Mataji worked on a man who was going bald. She rubbed some of the amla hair oil on his head. I felt jealous; I was getting bald also. I wished Mother had given me a bit of that oil. But I couldn't say it. Mother was about to leave. Later on, Maria Amelia comes back. "Oh, look, Mother gave you this bottle of amla oil." Mother made it easy for us to see that she knew everything, even small thoughts.

Inspired by Shri Mataji's saying about my girlfriend—"if you really love her, marry her"—I thought, "But I don't love her." That was the problem. But still, I tried. I went to her home to meet her parents.
