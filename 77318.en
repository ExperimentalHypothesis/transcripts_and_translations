So, you all have given me your Sahasrara. All right?

Now am I supposed to go in the school?
Sahaja Yogini: If you would like to do this, Shri Mataji, I don’t know what you would like to do.
Shri Mataji: Just see now.
Arnaud: Children should stay behind.
Sahaja Yogini: This will be the first primary class, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: First grade.
Sahaja Yogini: Primary.
Shri Mataji: Very nice, I tell you, very beautiful here.
Babamama: Shall we go in? Thank you.

Sahaja Yogini: The first class, Shri Mataji, is the painting and handicraft classroom we have finished, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Well down, very well. The colours are very well for children. Like all this.
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi to Babamama]

Sahaja Yogini: Here is the painting and handicraft classroom, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah, ah. That’s good, from childhood only to start, very good idea. Very good. Beautiful.
Very beautiful.

What they will do with this?
Sahaja Yogini: It will be to put their paintings and their works while they are drying, till they are dry.
Shri Mataji: They will do such big paintings?
All right. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Arnaud: Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Ah.
Arnaud: A small change: children need to drink [unclear]. All the parents leave after [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Give another sweet pie. [Unsure].
Arnaud: And children will be very happy if we could have.

Please be seated. All of you are sit down for 5 minutes. First and foremost thing, all the parents want to have jam [unsure] for being so kind to the children.
[Applause]

I must say she’s a real mother. A real motherhood. Even I tell you, people have their children, but they cannot sacrifice anything for their children. Say, supposing, the father is unhappy with the wife. He leaves her. The wife will leave the husband. That’s the trouble, not thinking that we have to look after our children. And we have to sacrifice for children also.

That's how the children know the love. But you have to also control children. Some children can become very right sided. You have to control them, that's very important. This is the time they say, "Pancha varshaani laalayaeth Dhasa varshaani thaadayael" [Sanskrit]. From 5 years, children can be beaten now. Why?
[To a child] 'Beat up', it doesn’t mean that you beat them. But you have to mould them, you have to give them a discipline. Whatever discipline they get at this age, will help them all their lives and they’ll thank you for this. Otherwise, if you just leave them alone, then they will say that, "It is the parents or the teachers who are mediocre".

There's a nice story in India. There’s one man who was taken for hanging, because he did lots of murders, lots of killings, this, that. So they said, "What is your last wish?". He said, "Call my mother". They called the mother. He just got hold of her hand, and he bit her very strongly, and blood started coming out. She started screaming. She said, "What are you doing?" He said, "This hand, you never used when I was doing wrong, when I was killing". "She did not punish me. If she had punished me, I would not have been such a bad man. I'm such a bad person, because I was not corrected. And it was her duty as a mother to correct me". So, mother's duty is to correct the children. The teachers’ duty is to correct the children, to give them a proper childhood. And one should not resist on them. In all your softness and sweetness and gentleness, you should give idea of pure love while the pure love corrects, nourishes, improves, and evolves. If that cannot be done, then it is not pure love, it is just personal love or can be very limited love. And the day will come and they will [unclear] that they had parents like [gurujis? Unsure].

So, it is important that you [unclear] the children with love. [Unclear] Otherwise, the children will be extremely aggressive. They’ll be extremely pushing and will always try to be very important. They are very important, no doubt. You must control them, put right. Otherwise, as I tell you, later on you’ll find it.

So, bringing up children is likely one of the most important things for Sahaja Yoga. Because they are all Realised souls. They are all very knowledgeable. They know lots of things. They are very clever. And to control them is very difficult. But if you show them through your own behaviour, that you are a real Sahaja Yogi, they will try to follow you. And they will try to make wonderful Sahaja Yogis out of you, more balanced, more sensible, dignified.

So, this is a very important work and I think you should pay full attention to it. And everybody must try to encourage people who are looking after the children and must try to help them, those who are looking after the children, because they are tomorrow’s Sahaja Yogis. And once they are there, we can do a lot!
So, that's the real thing, I think. As they say that, in the war, there is first the front and then the rear is kept for special occasions, so they'll be coming back again on the field.

So, we have to be very careful with them. We have to look after; we have to love them. Plus, we have to guide them so that they do not do things which are not good. So, there’s nothing wrong in guiding children. It's very important. Thank you very much.

Arnaud: Shri Mataji, the only thing I would like to express, with all the blessings, we [unclear] this house and we were able to found out [unclear]

[Inaudible]

Long time, I did not allow you to take the children.

Like in Australia, they brought the school all the way from Melbourn to Sydney. I never knew.
And all the children are gone. All the children are gone! And they never told me. Till I discovered after one year or two years. They had never told me. Can you see that? My attention was on Melbourne, while they were all there.

Where is Marie? Marie?
You are not taking any interest in Sahaja Yoga. They say, whenever you're coming, just you go on complaining, that's not good. I told him that she's coming there, I'm very happy. She is going there. She'll be of a great help to you in Sahaja Yoga. And she did so much in Frankfort!
[Inaudible] What happened? Something has changed, what is happening?
Marie: I am not aware that I have been complaining. [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: No, but you should have, a great thing that she is coming here. And it’s [unclear conversation] Are you lost in your married life?

So, [Indian name], is she here? [Indian name],
Arnaud: I don't think, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Please tell her. I’m quite worried about her.
Sahaja Yogi: I’m here, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Who's there? Since she has married you, she has become a very inactive Sahaja Yogini. You and she, both are responsible. She has become extremely inactive. She’s worried about your child. Your child is not all right. You’d better brought her to London, I must correct the child. Child has problems here [showing the head]. You know that or not? She has problems in her brain. You have to correct it. You both are responsible. [Unclear name] I know you for the most active person in Sahaja Yoga. [Indian name], she's the one who took Me to France so many times. Now, I don't know what happen to her. Marriage should make you more active in Sahaja Yoga. The worship of marriage. You don't want to finish off activities [unclear] marriage of someone. Really not. Please, try to see to that, to again become married [unsure]. Otherwise, some problems will pump up and you [unclear sentence]
Be very active to I think to- now I think, you should check out the [unclear sentence]. But, you take some interest.

I was amazed, I asked him, "Did she complain to you? " He said, "No". How can it be such a thing? I can’t understand. Instead of binging him up, she should go down. What does that mean? How can that be?

Same thing, Ruth, I'm rather surprised that Ruth [unsure and unclear part]

We have to be collective. We have to be more concerned. We have to take up responsibilities. Not to complain, but to take up responsibilities. Sahaja Yoga is for the whole world. That shows that you people have lacked [unsure] the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

We are, I should say, but every time I find you and your wife coming in the car. It’s wrong. You are the leader. Let her go with someone, like Marcus. Marcus has never carried his wife. In the same way, you put her in another car and you bring other people because you are the leader. People will see you, they will start behaving in the same manner as you are. I'm sorry I have to say it. Because other leaders will start doing the same thing. It will be a big problem. This husband wife relationship, if it could be reduced a little less, I think Sahaja Yoga will come up. It's too much! "My family my children, my this".

You are French, are you not? You’re French or Swiss?
Sahaja Yogi: Swiss.
Shri Mataji: Swiss are not that [unclear]. English are, but not Swiss. So what? Why pull her down?

You cannot come up. You see, what is your final destiny? Decide on this. We must know our destiny.
What is our destiny?
We have to fulfil our destiny.
Is it our destiny to be married, to have children, to have insurances and then die?
Is it our destiny?
Find it, answer it.

What is our destiny?
Is it to produce children, leave some money for them and then die? Is that our destiny?
We have to fulfil our destiny and the fulfilment of the destiny is, that we have to become divine and make others divine. Men of God will become saintly, and they'll make others, men of God and saints. It’s said by a great poet like William Blake. And that's what is your destiny.

You are missing your destiny. These are frivolousness things, useless. Marriage: how many times you were married before? "Marriage, and my child, my house, my furniture, my property, my [unclear]" I don't know when you end up.
This time now, I'm telling you that marriage is just a sided thing to have good children on this earth and give them a good education in Sahaja Yoga, to give them support in health, and to create an atmosphere for them to come. But they are my children!

You all understand that? I'm sure our children will also understand. They will be all right.
Sorry, I have to say I’m going, but my heart is quite full, leaving you here.
But I think certain things must be seen.
Every leader’s wife has a duty [unclear] to see that every person has been looked after. Do you understand that on your side? Do you see that point? That you have to look after everyone. That's your duty. Yesterday, I told you. All of you should look after. Has everybody gone? "I think you are coming", if everybody in the car or not. Who said he would be there? That's the duty of every leader’s wife. And to keep behind. Settle there [unsure].

I think better get it translated in every other language [unclear sentences].

Are these the sweets for the children? I can have one myself.
They like chana, they can have chana. They are in for chana. For children to have, as much as they like.
We are not to be like beggars. We are not to be like beggars that come, and you have to be dignified.
We are all Sahaja Yogis, great people. If we are given, we’ll take. We’ll not put in any hand forward. Why should you ask for? You are Yogis. You are saints. Hum?
All right. We are saints. Remember that, we are saints.
Now, that is good, isn't it?
All the attention should not be on food, should not be on other things but should be on our study, and in dignity, all right? You are saints! People should see that, "These are Yogis".
Why are you looking at that? Let her give. You seat this side.
[Laughter]
Now, give it to children, that's all.
Now, you don't, don't, don't.
[Laughter]
Now, take it now. It’s all right. Now you give.

You see, in India, if any child looks like a stupid fool, the mother will two tight slaps, finished! You'll never find Indian children misbehaving. Have you noticed? Never. The food is served, anything is given, the child has to give forward. [Unclear]
Two tight slaps.
All right? Now no more. No more looking at [unclear], no more looking at things, but looking at your studies.
All right? Do you promise me that?
All the children.
Now, can I take your leave.
Please enjoy yourself.
