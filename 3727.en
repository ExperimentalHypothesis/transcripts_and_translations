[English Transcript]

I am so very filled with joy and My heart is so full of gratitude for all the Sahaja Yogis who have been able to create this beautiful place.

I cannot imagine how much they must have worked hard in such a place to create such a beautiful area, such a blissful place. How in Sahaja Yoga people work together with tremendous respect and love for each other, and produce something that is unbelievable. This was just a wilderness, and you have brought so much of life and light in this place. You wanted to celebrate My birthday. I don't know what is such a significant about it. But the way you have really shown your understanding and respect, I am just enamored. I can't understand what have I done for you, that you should do so much for Sahaja Yoga. As it is, today is also a very auspicious day which we call as the Holi. They play Holi on this day and show their love and oneness among themselves. This is the time when we have to really understand the value of love, of respect of others, because so far we have based all our theories and all our ideas on the principle that human beings cannot love each other.

They are always trying to overpower others or to hate others, or to grab things from others. Such a wrong idea we had all these days, and that's why all the organizations that were created to obstruct it also got contaminated with it. The only way one can really understand what we are is by knowing yourself. When you know yourself you are surprised that what is the greatest thing for you is to love and to be loved. You enjoy that collective love so much when you are absolutely overcome your baser self. In Sahaja Yoga it is so simple. It works in a very simple manner. It's very Sahaja! But to grow into it is very important, and I am so very happy to see so many of you from all over the world, from Delhi and also from all over India, enjoying that love among yourselves and understanding among yourselves. I never expected that in My lifetime I'll be able to see all this beautiful world of love, trust and peace.

But today really I must say, it shows what we are capable of doing. We human beings, so-called, are very selfish, self-centered and only worried about ourselves. That is what is said! but it's surprising that with Self-Realization, with self-knowledge, with knowing yourself, you understand how rich you are within, how great you are within and how capable you are. This understanding comes to you, and then that is expressed in such a beautiful manner. Sahaja Yoga took time to grow, slowly and slowly, and that you all have slowly and slowly grown also. But today I must say that it has reached such a height that it's difficult for people to get out of it. When you know yourself, when you know what is reality and what is absolute truth, you just get dissolved into that knowledge. Of course you are not knowledgeable in the way people are; you are knowledgeable in the real sense of the word, because you realize what is within you is a big power of love. There's a big power of understanding.

(Can you bring Me some water?) - Hindi All right. There's a big power of understanding, a big power of oneness, of collective. This collectivity works wonders and gives such joy that we are all one, we have no enemies, we have no problems. We are all one together. It goes on faling this. It's better. Yes, that's the way it should... It's too high. It's all right.

This joy that was expressed by you is like the waves that go to the shores, touch the shores and come back, creating beautiful patterns. And I see that happening now, that these beautiful patterns are showing in your own life, in your lifestyle, in your behavior. There is a very special type of human race is sitting before Me. I am so much thankful to you, absolutely, that you should take to this simple knowledge of yourself and enjoy it with others. It's something remarkable that you know about yourself, that's only human beings can do. There can be a diamond, very expensive, but it doesn't know its value. There could be some dog or some animal which must be something par excellence, but he doesn't know what he is. Same thing happens with the human beings till they get their Self-Realization. And after Realization, they suddenly become aware of what they are. And then suddenly they become very humble, they become very loving.

Now supposing if somebody knows that he is a king, or he discovers that he is a some great musician or a prime minister or something. He feels very aloof and he thinks no end of himself. But by this knowledge that you have, you become one with the rest of Sahaja Yogis and enjoy it. It's very remarkable how it works out that you enjoy each other so much. And to do something for this collective work, you can dedicate yourself to it. Now My experience of seventy-seven years, as you can say, has been really checkered with all kinds of incidents, all kinds of people, all kinds of incidents. And it's a good vision to see before your eyes that despite all that, so many beautiful lotuses have come out, and they are so fragrant, so beautiful, so colorful, so attractive. All this is because we have an innate value system, because we have inborn within us a great sense of love and compassion. This compassion has to be really understood and enjoyed, and jump in the ocean of compassion. So beautiful, and you'll be amazed to see that automatically you'll swim, automatically you'll meet other people also in the same ocean, and without any problems, without any troubles, all enjoying the bliss of this love, this compassion, this Divine love.

I must really congratulate the Delhi people for coming up so well with this beautiful arrangement and this beautiful pendal, and all the beautiful arrangements they have made outside for your stay. I mean really it's something, I have done nothing for it, nothing, I should say. How these people have worked together: there have been no quarrels, fighting, backbiting, nothing of the kind. It's very surprising that such a beautiful thing has been created by them; shows their maturity in Sahaja Yoga. I must congratulate them again and again for doing this great work in such a short time.

[Translation from Hindi]

First I talked in English because many people have come here from foreign countries. And you don't have any objection that we talk in English for a little while. This is an amazing feat by people of Delhi, to whom people of Uttar Pradesh joined, people from Rajasthan also joined, and people from Haryana also helped - and together they made with love this very beautiful pandal like a temple. I, Myself, was surprised seeing it that there are such talented artists here. I didn't know.

Where did this art come from? I can't understand how they made and decorated all this. I didn't know that there are such talented artists in our country and that too, talent of love. The power of love, the art of love and the art of loving everybody, whosoever gets it, only he can do such an artistic composition. One should learn this art that how with the help of our speech, heart and mind we can become artists, artists of love and how we can make others happy by our words, and spread joy among them. What kind of loving things can we say? This is the aspect of speech. Then with our mind we can think, how we can shower our love among people, how we can open our heart in front of others and establish them in our heart. And for heart aspect, if a person doesn't have love in his heart he does not deserve anything in the world; because whatever he gets, he cannot be satisfied in any way, he cannot be content. But when there is an ocean of contentment within you then is there anything that cannot satisfy you?

When it happens within you and the peace of contentment establishes within you, then, nobody can understand the boundaries of that contentment, then nobody can understand this business of contenment. All that happens in so sweet and beautiful that it is a real spectacle. One can't understand what he is doing and what others are doing, what they are saying and what he is saying, and how are they covering him with their love, and how shall he shower his love on them. Day and night all he worries about is that: "Today, whom I have to meet and what loving things should I tell them, what can I tell them for their benevolence". Because the practice of talking about useless things leads only to loss. It has never been beneficial and afterwards the anger that comes in a human being leads to even more harm. Then there is no need to teach one not to be violent, not to treat anyone badly, not to destroy anyone, and not to cheat anybody for money. There is no need to teach all this. You became so beautiful on your own. I said that you have become lotuses yourselves, that you only know to spread your fragrance and nothing else.

And the joy of giving to others - to feel that joy is an unique experience. Only people with a novel personality can do it. Now you are the masters of it and the heritage that you had, you have utilized it fully. Now that thing is open to everyone, it spread everywhere, and now it is about enjoying it. There are many different type of people in the world, but they cannot touch you, cannot bother you. If at all something happens, then it will be that they become one among you and they would turn in your favour. After seeing your life, they will at least be inclined to change themselves, they will think: "Let us also change". I don't say that I have taken the responsibility of changing this whole world but you can take this responsibility. If you change this world, if you create virtuous and saintly people, then after that there is no need to do anything else. Then you just witness and enjoy it.

The only important thing is that you get fully involved into it, start working it out and see how many people you can transform. It is agreed that an ordinary human being has got a number of flaws. Such human being who is full of flaws can be beautifully introduced to his great unknown Self. The Self that is within you, the Atma that is within you - when you get introduced to it, then you realize that others must do the same. They should also know themselves. They are lost. They don't know what a treasure they have inside. So, this (Realization) must be given, and they must get it. When such discussions begin, you will take this responsibility on yourself that, "We should give others this treasure, too". You have the key to their treasure, and if somehow you give this great gift to them, then you will see how they are going to recognize you and how they will be grateful to you.

The greatest work for you now is to bring as many people as you can to that Sahaja state, and give them this treasure. And when this will happen, you will yourself get fully immersed in it and happy and you will get a kind of joy, which cannot be described. This has to be done. Today you have celebrated My birthday, I am very thankful for that. And you have done all this so happily. For Me the important thing is that every year Sahaja Yoga spread widely and even I cannot fathom its boundaries now. But, today, you must also take a vow, on your Mother's birthday, that, "We will all try to transform others". We have already got transformed, but we should transform others as well. Only this will give you the completeness of this joy. Till now, the joy you have had is limited, but when you will spread it among others, and when it will resonate in others - having this experience and understanding it, then a great new joy will awaken within you.

I was watching how young boys and children were dancing so joyfully. Shri Krishna started this Holi celebration so that everybody would get a state of joy. Shri Rama's style made human beings very serious type. Their life became serious. He (Shri Krishna) devised a method so that human beings break out of their shell and play mirthfully. And only Sahaja Yogis can celebrate it (Holi) in a proper way with love amongst themselves. They do not celebrate to trouble others but to express their own joy and to make others feel joyous as well. Eternal blessings to everyone.
