Birthday Puja. Delhi (India), 21 March 2000.

I’m so very filled with joy and My heart is so full of gratitude for all the Sahaja Yogis who have been able to create this beautiful place. I cannot imagine how much they must have been worked hard in such a place, to create such a beautiful area, such a blissful place. How in Sahaja Yoga, people worked together with tremendous love and respect with each other, have produced something that it unbelievable! This was just a wilderness and you have brought so much of life and light in this place.
You wanted to celebrate My Birthday. I don’t know what is such a significance about it. But, the way you have really shown your understanding and respect, I’m just enamoured. I can’t understand what I have done for you, that you should do so much for Sahaja Yoga.
As it is, today is also a very auspicious day, which we call as Holi. They play Holi on this day and show their love and oneness among themselves. This is the time when we have to really understand the value of love, of respect of others.
Because, so far, we have based all our theories and all our ideas on the principle that human beings cannot love each other. They are always trying to overpower others or to hate others or to grab things from others. Such a wrong idea we had all these days. And that’s why all the organizations that were created to obstruct it also got contaminated with it.
The only way one can really understand what we are is by knowing yourself. When you know yourself, we are surprised that, what is the greatest thing for you is to love and to be loved. You enjoy that collective Love so much when you have absolutely overcome your baser self. In Sahaja Yoga, it is so simple. It works in a very simple manner. It’s very Sahaj. But to grow into it is very important. And I am so much happy to see so many of you, from all over the world, from Delhi, and also from all over India, enjoying that love among yourselves and understanding among yourselves.
I never expected that, in My lifetime, I’ll be able to see all this beautiful world of love, trust and peace. But, today, really I must say, it shows what we are capable of doing. We human beings, so-called, are very selfish, self-centred and only worried about ourselves. That is what is said. But it is surprising that, with Self-Realisation, with self-knowledge, with knowing yourself, you understand how rich you are within. How great you are within. And how capable you are. This understanding comes to you, and then that is expressed in such a beautiful manner.
Sahaja Yoga took time to grow, slowly and slowly and that you all are have slowly and slowly grown also. But, I must say that it has reached such a height, that it is difficult to people to get out of it. When you know yourself and you know what is reality and what is absolute truth, you just get dissolved into that knowledge.
Of course, you are not knowledgeable in the way people are, you are knowledgeable in the real sense of the word. Because you realized what is within you is a big power of love. It is a big power of understanding. There is a big power of understanding, a big power of oneness, of collective. This collectivity works wonders and gives us joy that we are all one, we have no enemies. We have no problems, we are all one together.
This joy that was expressed by you is like the waves that go to the shores, touch the shores and come back, creating beautiful patterns. And I see that happening now, that these beautiful patterns are showing in your own life, in your lifestyle, in your behaviour. It’s a very special type of human race is sitting before Me. I’m so much thankful to you, absolutely, that you should take to this simple knowledge of yourself and enjoy it with others.
It’s something remarkable that you know about yourself. That, only human beings can do. There can be a diamond, very expensive, and it does not know its value. There could be some dog or some animal which must be something par excellence, but it doesn’t know what he is. Same thing happens with the human beings, till they get their Self-Realization. And after Realization, they suddenly become aware of what they are and then suddenly they become very humble, they become very loving.
Now, supposing, somebody knows that he is a king or he discovers he is some great musician or a prime minister or something. He feels very aloof and he thinks no end of himself. But, by this knowledge that you have, you become one with the rest of Sahaja Yogis and enjoys it. It’s very remarkable how it works out that you enjoy each other so much. And to do something for this collective work, you can dedicate yourself to it.
Now, My experience of seventy-seven years, as you can say, has been really chequered with all kinds of incidents, all kinds of people, all kinds of incidents. And it’s a good vision to see before your eyes that, despite all that, so many beautiful lotuses have come up, and they are so fragrant, so beautiful, so colourful, so attractive. All this is because we have an innate value system, because we have, inborn within us, a great sense of love and compassion. This compassion has to be really understood. And enjoy and jump in the ocean of compassion. So beautiful! And you’ll be amazed to see that automatically you’ll swim, automatically you will meet other people also in the same ocean and, without any problems, without any troubles, all enjoying the bliss of this love, this compassion, this Divine Love.
I must really congratulate the Delhi people for coming up so well with this beautiful arrangement and this beautiful pandal and all the beautiful arrangements they have made outside for your stay. And I am really… It is something… I have done nothing for it. Nothing, I should say… How these people have worked together, there has been no quarrels, fighting, backbiting, nothing of that kind!
It is very surprising that such a beautiful thing has been created by them shows their maturity in Sahaja Yoga. I must congratulate them again and again for doing this great work in such a short time.
