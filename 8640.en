b'1995-10-29 Diwali Puja\n\n[translation from Hindi]\n\nI had not thought that after twenty-five years, so many Sahaj yogis would collect in Nargol. When I first came here, I had no idea that Sahastrara would be opened. I was just thinking that we needed to observe the status of Man. Man had not yet reached the stage where he would understand what Self-realisation is, although many saints had provided proof of Self-realisation. This knowledge is known to a great extent in Maharashtra, because the people who followed the middle path, called Nath Panthis, had suggested there was only one path to be followed for the betterment of oneself, and that was the path of Self-realisation. I also knew that you cannot get anything without knowing your own Self. But I saw that the situation of human beings at that time was rather strange. The people they were trying to follow were not pious. They had no other motive than earning money, and when a man\xe2\x80\x99s situation is like that, when he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognise truth at all, it is very difficult to tell him about truth. And why should people listen to me? Repeatedly, I felt that that Man should struggle a little more. But I found that people were facing the torture of Kali Yuga very badly. On the one hand, the people who had done good deeds in their previous lives were being tortured by those who had done bad deeds. Among those, there were also people who were dismayed and in great distress on account of the karmas of their previous births, and there were also some who, because of their karmas of previous lives, took birth in this world of devils and would never hesitate to brutally torture, pester and degrade anyone. So, I observed specially two types of people: those who torture others and those who are tortured.\n\nNow it had to be decided, to whom to pay attention. Those who troubled others were egoistic and would think of themselves as perfect persons. They would never imagine that they were troubling and bothering others. And those who were tortured were tolerating; maybe because of compulsion or maybe they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that they should retaliate against those who behave in such a manner, that they should revolt against such people. At that time, I was thinking that Man would think of transforming himself, transforming his inner being, because both the groups had already reassured themselves. Some people were more troublesome, while others were less, and some people were tolerating more torture, while others were tolerating less. This was the situation of the society, whether it was in the name of God or in the name of nation; whether it was political or economic, with some people in poverty, while others were affluent.\n\nSo, in this way, a process of decline was going on in this country. I understood that as long as Man didn\xe2\x80\x99t get transformed and didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognise himself, as long as he didn\xe2\x80\x99t obtain his dignity and eminence, till then he would go on acting in that way. This was already in my mind, from my childhood on, and I thought that it was very important to understand human beings. So, first of all I did a lot of study\xc2\xa0of human beings by being detached from them. I tried to understand them in my witness state, as to what are the faults of their past lives, and why human beings think like that. Then I reached the conclusion that either a man has too much ego, or too much superego, which we call conditioning. Because of both of these, he is not balanced. Unless he is balanced, how can the Kundalini rise? And that, too, is such a great thing.\n\nBut when I came to Nargol, due to some strange reasons, a very wicked rakshasa who had set up his camp there sent word to my husband that I should visit his camp. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like him at all. Even so, I obeyed my husband and went there, and most probably the bungalow I am staying in right now is the same one we were staying in then.\n\nOn the previous day, I was sitting under a tree watching their drama, and was so surprised that this person was giving them mantras and mesmerising them. Many people were screaming and shouting; some were barking, and growling like lions. I understood that he was shifting them into their previous lives, and I was nervous to see that he was awakening their subconscious mind. I had seen also these false gurus earlier and observed what they did. People should know what they do and how they do this business. And I noticed one thing, that these people were very frightened. They would have their guns with them and their guards with them. I thought, if they are doing God\xe2\x80\x99s work, why do they need such things? And they were charging limitless money. They\xc2\xa0looted crores of rupees from people by telling lies. These two things were in my mind. I thought that it was a result of Kali Yuga that such people were still thriving. But the only solution was that when Man\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness awakened, he would have pure knowledge and he would understand that all this was untruth and it was useless to follow such things. The third thing I saw was that in the society I was living in, all the time people were doing all sorts of things that would lead to their destruction; for example, drinking, running after women, and things like that. And they hankered after money. And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be talking in a natural way. They would talk in a strange manner. They would pose and talk dramatically. I would think, what has happened to Man? Why is he entangled in this drama business and doing wrong things? But whom could I tell? I was all alone.\n\nThat time when I came here, the only problem was what should be done. After coming here, when I saw that these rakshasas were mesmerising people, then I understood that if Sahastrara was not somehow opened, God knows where the people would drift to. As a consequence, the followers, the seekers of God, the seekers of truth, God knows where they might go. Then after noticing this, the next day, early in the morning, I was at the sea coast for the full night. I was alone and I felt very good. There was nobody to disturb me. Then in my meditation, I thought again, \xe2\x80\x98Let Sahastrara be opened.\xe2\x80\x99 And as soon as I desired it, that let the Bramharandra of Sahastrara be opened. I saw my Kundalini in my own being, shooting up like a telescope: khat,\xc2\xa0khat, khat. Its colour was like the combination of all the colours of Diyas (earthen pots) that you have lit here. Then I saw the outer yantra of that Kundalini was rising up and up and up, looking just like the colour of iron when it gets hot in furnace.\xc2\xa0At every chakra there was a noise \xe2\x80\x92 khat, khat, khat \xe2\x80\x92 and the Kundalini pierced Bramharandra. my piercing didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. But I saw that it would now be easier in the universe. And at that time I felt that some power, whatever it was, dawned into my inner being, and a Cool Breeze came from all around me. Now I understood that there was no harm in starting my work, because whatever complications were there, were over. With full confidence, I thought that now the time had come.\n\nAfter all, what would happen? At best, the people would kill me, beat me; at best they would laugh at me, make fun of me, and after that they would kill everybody. There is nothing to be scared of. This has to be done. I have come to this world for this purpose only. Because I have to invoke collective consciousness, I thought that unless people get their Self-realisation and know their own Self, it is impossible to achieve my goal. We may do other things, but it is all useless. So first of all, I experimented with a very old lady who had much faith in me, and she got her Self-realisation. Then I was confident. I thought that at least one person has got realisation. In this Kali Yuga, is it easy to give realisation to anyone? When one person got realisation, I thought that it was possible that many would also get it. And it was easy to give realisation collectively. It was easy to give realisation to one person. It was easy to pay attention to one person. But for the collective realisation, whatever I had experienced about human beings, there was still some more work to be done. What should be done when I find that somebody has a bad quality, or has some trouble, or is conditioned? Because one person has one problem, another has a different problem, and a third person has a third problem. If collective work is to be done, just with one awakening, everybody should benefit. It should be helpful to everyone. Right now, because of the shortage of time, I cannot make you understand that till this time, this collective realisation work, which had not been done before by anyone, was done by me with the help of a lot of deep meditation.\n\nAs I was rotating my Kundalini all around, using my Kundalini repeatedly to influence others, nobody knew what powers I had inside me. Who am I? Nobody knew. Nobody in our house knew. And nobody knew in my in-laws\xe2\x80\x99 house, either. In my parents\xe2\x80\x99 house, too, nobody knew. And I never told anybody, because it is not easy to put it into their heads, because Man\xe2\x80\x99s brain is such that it is very difficult to thrust any thought into it. Everybody is egoistic; everybody feels self-important. Now, who will tell them? As Kabir has said, \xe2\x80\x98How shall I make the whole world understand?\xe2\x80\x99 I feel it is not blindness but ignorance, absolutely a huge collection of ignorance. And how to transmit this subtle knowledge?\n\nWhen the Kundalini of that lady, that Devi, got awakened, I noticed that she had subtle knowledge, and she started understanding me with the help of that subtle knowledge. After that, twelve people got realisation, and after getting realisation, they were surprised because their eyes sparkled absolutely. And they started seeing everything. They started experiencing some strange change inside their being.\xc2\xa0In the beginning, I worked on all the chakras individually of the first twelve people, because elements give strength to its foundation and we have to struggle hard to make it strong. Although their Kundalini had awakened, you know that even after the Kundalini is awakened, we have to meditate to take it into the right direction, and it has to settle down. I worked very hard for these twelve people. As a result, I understood that if the twelve behaviors of these twelve people were somehow synchronized, how can the power of the enlightened soul be organized? Just as we thread flowers into a needle, how can that totality be obtained? How can the different behaviors of these twelve people be synchronized into one common formula? And when they got their realisation, I saw that, by and by, all of them were becoming integrated internally. I had to work even a little harder. But I realized that to tell somebody, to tell people in general about it, was not so easy. It is not for the people to understand. Then a program was organised in Jahangir Hall. There I said, \xe2\x80\x98How many rakshasas have come, and how many rakshasnis have come? What will they do?\xe2\x80\x99 Everybody got frightened. They started saying that if Mataji talked this way, how would anyone help Her? All of them advised me not to talk in that manner; otherwise there would be great problems. I told them, \xe2\x80\x98Till now, my killer is not born, and you should be free from worry.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nBy and by, I told these small streams inside everybody and small rivers of Kundalini, \xe2\x80\x98You concentrate on my Kundalini.\xe2\x80\x99 And they became thoughtless the moment they started to meditate. And the moment they became thoughtless, they felt that they had a lot of identity with me. By and by, there was more and more thoughtless awareness. By and by, there was more focus on collectivity. This I saw first of all in Jahangir Hall. Hindustanis, Indians, have taken birth on this land because they are very religious-minded. They must have lived a noble life, because in India we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to work so hard. In no time people would get realisation. Of course, in the beginning it took a little more time. But in foreign countries, hands get tired. To raise someone\xe2\x80\x99s Kundalini is just like lifting a mountain, and then it falls down with a bump. It rises up and then falls down with a bump. And there is a great difficulty with collectivity, asking weird questions, this and that, and all sorts of worldly talk. When I answered their questions, they would get surprised. How does She know all this? How does She have knowledge about all this? They examined me a lot, because they had lots of ego.\n\nNow, by and by in London, the first time, seven Sahaj yogis came. All of them were like hippies and drug addicts. They transformed into Sahaj yogis. It meant that I got some support, in a way, and I was confident that in Sahaj Yoga people were denouncing drugs.\n\nIt is not so easy to help a drug addict. Out of this, one good experience was gained that even the most difficult person must get connected and must have the knowledge of his own Self, when he desires it. He gets his Self-realisation simply by desiring it. Then I would tell everyone to desire for Self-realisation in their hearts. That helped them to get their Self-realisation.\n\nI have\xc2\xa0experiences in many countries, for example, Russia, Ukraine and Romania. These countries, I feel, must have been in some close contact with our countries at some time in the past. And Nath Panthis, Machendra Nath and Gorakh Nath must have visited these countries from here. Because whatever I got from their countries, I could understand that these people knew about the Kundalini, even three hundred years before the birth of Christ. Then I understood how these people got their Self-realisation so quickly.\n\nNath Panthis worked a lot in Maharashtra, and I, too, worked very hard. But I feel disappointed that whatever\xc2\xa0work I could do in north India, could not be done in Maharashtra, even now. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, because this is the place where saints have shed their blood, and every Maharashtrian knows what work Nath Panthis have done. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it is that what I achieved in north India could not be achieved in Maharashtra. In the beginning, I would call Delhi as Billy. There also I worked very hard, but I was very much surprised\xc2\xa0to see\xc2\xa0the Sahaj yogis I found there and the way Sahaj yoga was spreading there. Seeing this flow, I am so surprised that the place where so many saints worked so hard \xe2\x80\x92 and since our childhood, we have learnt and studied \xe2\x80\x92 here everybody is telling the same thing, that in this Maharashtra Sahaj Yoga didn\xe2\x80\x99t spread as much as it has in the north. What is the reason? I feel that when everything is already known, it is not respected. It is treated with indifference. There is a shalok in Sanskrit: \xe2\x80\x98Ati Parichayat\xc2\xa0Avaghya Santat Gamana\xc2\xa0Anadaro Bhavati, Prayagvasi Kripe Sananam Samacharet\xe2\x80\x99. It means that when you go anywhere repeatedly, or meet a person frequently, you are disrespected. Then you lose your respect. Because people of Prayag, Allahabad, instead of taking bath in Gangaji, which is the meeting point of three rivers called Triveni, take bath with water drawn from the well of their homes, whereas people from all over the world go there to take their bath. Maybe this is the reason that Sahaj Yoga has so much recognition in north\xc2\xa0 India.\xc2\xa0It is not because there is a shortage of Sahaj yogis. There are many Sahaj yogis in Maharashtra who are practising it, but I never found they had the dedication that is required for Sahaj Yoga. Maybe it will increase. Dedication means to know how to utilize the Sahaj yogi status that has been\xc2\xa0given to us. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand if they think only of their benefit, their own problems, of their own families and not for the whole world. In spite of the culture of Maharashtra and the deep impression made by their religion, Sahaj Yoga has not spread to that extent. And in Gujarat, in Nargol, where I opened Bramharandra, there are more problems. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand the people of Gujarat. I worked very hard in Gujarat, but I worked the hardest in Maharashtra. Today, there are many Maharashtrians here. I want to say that to spread Sahaj Yoga, first of all\xc2\xa0you meditate and go deep. When you attain that depth, then you feel, \xe2\x80\x98Why should only I enjoy its blessings and not let other people do so as well?\xe2\x80\x99 When you get this feeling, Sahaj Yoga spreads. Day and night, the same thought gives a lot of pleasure.\n\nToday I am happy that people from all over the world have come here, and many others have come from foreign countries, from Delhi and other places. It is a matter of happiness for me how all of you reached such a basic/primitive place. It is all the blessing of love. It is all your love. It is a great thing. But the only difference is that in Kolhapur we worked very hard, but Sahaj Yoga has established very little there. It is so surprising. Why it is so? They told me that there are eight hundred Sahaj yogis in Pandharpur, but it is not so here. If we go to Gaziabad, there are fifteen thousand, in Faridabad there are sixteen thousand, and in Haryana there are twenty-five thousand. There they are in the thousands, but in Maharashtra, there are eight hundred here, five hundred there and seven hundred there. What is the reason? I could not understand it till now. It is possible that here there are self-knowledge, Self-realisation, and a people with knowledge of the minutest things; so much has happened that now there is no attention towards this. In Maharashtra, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have any yearning for money, as you find in Gujarat and even in Uttar Pradesh. In north India there is much longing for money. It is not so in Maharashtra. Praying to God from morning till evening, getting up early in the morning at 4 a.m., doing this, doing that, is agreeable. But it is all mechanical. Do it by heart, do it with devotion and try to share that devotion. Maharashtrians must\xc2\xa0follow it. I know that we have our Ganapatipule programs in Maharashtra every year, and there are very good Sahaj yogis in Maharashtra \xe2\x80\x92 deep, very deep! The Yuva Shakti of this place, too, is very good. Still, I would appreciate it if it had spread to the extent to which it has spread in the north.\n\nNow, you see, my in-laws are in Barah Banki.\xc2\xa0 Every place, every village, everywhere where Sahaj Yoga has reached just one person, the place has become a Sahaj yogi place, just like a small spark in dry wood causes it to catch on fire.\xc2\xa0What makes it flow so forcefully, I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand, and whoever gets it, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any questions. But in Maharashtra, they ask a lot of questions, because they have read lots of books. In the houses, each day, you can see that any Maharashtrian has the photographs of at least ten gurus. Out of those, only one or two may be real gurus. And there are statues of every type. It is the land of Ganesha. Four Ganeshajis are sitting here, but it is called Ashtvinayak. I am saying four because two aspects or characteristics of each Ganesha are different here. Now, Maharashtrians know about that. They go there and do Ganesh Puja. Here, three Devis are well-recognized. Even then, they will go there. They will go to temples. They will go to the Mahalaxmi temple daily. All that they will do, but now they are in Sahaj Yoga, they do nothing. This is very surprising.\n\nToday, many Maharashtrians have come here, and I wanted to say that a great number of people have come from Delhi. So many people would never come from Maharashtra. In Marathi they are called Gharkonbde. It seems they can be found in their own country only. You will never find the people of Bombay in Poona doing any work, and the people of Poona are in a way glued like a rakshasa. I am saying so, because sometimes, by saying all this openly, the problem gets solved. I have to say openly that Aathvale are better than Sahaj Yogis in Maharashtra. They talk uselessly, but they have accumulated lakhs of people \xe2\x80\x92 not to mention Gujarat. They are under the influence of gurus. But what happened to Maharashtrians? Here, Ramdas Swami has talked about all the gurus and \xe2\x80\x92 I shall tell everyone to pay attention \xe2\x80\x92 so many years ago explained Sahaj Yoga. They sing every day. Namdev has written the song, \xe2\x80\x98Jogwa\xe2\x80\x99, that you sing every day: \xe2\x80\x98Mother, please give us yoga\xe2\x80\x99. But for that yoga you have to do something. If you go to any village, many people will come when I go there. After that, even if two people come together, you will be surprised. So, I would like to say that Maharashtrians should pray for these people. They can do Havana, some collective programs, so that there will be awakening in Maharashtra as it is in north India, in Russia. They are very much devoted, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why Sahaj Yoga doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spread there. It is spreading at a very slow pace. In Kolhapur there have been many pujas. Devi\xe2\x80\x99s temple is very beautiful. Everything is there. But there is not so much depth. For that, people should pay attention collectively because Maharashtra is a very big city, a very prestigious city, and whatever it is from the point of dharma, spiritually it is very prestigious. So, everybody should talk about the awakening of Maharashtra. There is no quarrel, no problem, but Sahaj Yoga has not spread as it should have. Maybe it will be all right in the future.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I had this strange perception that so many of you would come here, and how so many of you came to such a small place after twenty-five years. I worked very hard.\xc2\xa0But it is not surprising to observe that in such a small place, so many people understood the importance of spiritualism after twenty-five years.\n\nNargol in Sahaj Yoga means Sahastrara. And when I came here and saw the blessings of the forest and nature, I felt so happy and had a feeling in my heart that we had come to a very blessed place of nature. It was the month of May, and I was not feeling the heat of summer at all. When Sahaj yogis come, I absorb their heat, but here there were no Sahaj yogis. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel any heat and when I opened the Sahastrara, I found that people didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any knowledge of it. Mostly, they were Gujaratis, with few Maharashtrians. And in\xc2\xa0Maharashtra so many books have been written, They have written Holy books, not stories. Whatever they have written is truth. They write about chakras and the Kundalini. After writing so much and acquiring so much knowledge, if they utilise this, it will spread limitlessly.\n\nSahaj Yoga can spread here to a great extent. Now that our system of Sahaj Yoga has spread and is so deep, you must have understood it from the drama that you watched. In this drama they showed, with the help of their brain, why Mother came, and everybody said that they worked very hard. We tried our best to divert human beings towards spiritualism and let their attention be towards God and somehow let them get realisation, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. So we are now telling the Goddess to please incarnate. You incarnate and set right the world that You have created. This is absolutely right. There is no doubt about it, and it has happened like that, and it has formed like that. All the work is going on so smoothly, and when Sahastrara was opened, I had not thought that I would be able to see all this work done in my lifetime, but it is the work of the greatness of this Kundalini and Paramchaitanya. I am Myself surprised by this Paramchaitanya and don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is doing, although it is my Shakti, but you are witnessing that this Paramchaitanya is creating my photographs of various types and is showing varieties of miracles, almost fifty types of miracles.\n\nThere was a Mexican lady working in New York. I met her there. After that she got her realisation, too, and went to Mexico. There she got a job in the United Nations. She wrote a letter to me that her son was sick. He was very young, and this disease is hereditary in their clan when people become very old, but this child had inherited it at such a young age and now he could not survive. She had written to me three such letters. I was talking about Paramchaitanya, and in her fourth letter she wrote that the child was now all right. He was studying at Harvard University and was absolutely all right. He was absolutely cured of his disease. A doctor asked him, \xe2\x80\x98What did you do? How did you get well?\xe2\x80\x99 So there is no better doctor than this, and the way Paramchaitanya works is surprising.\n\nNow, somebody asked, \xe2\x80\x98What is this? Does Ganeshaji take milk?\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98This Paramchaitanya has come in Krita Yuga, and if it has some work to do, it does it, and whatever it does is less.\xc2\xa0There are hundreds of jobs to be done. They will feed milk to Ganeshaji, feed milk to Shivaji. Can we say anything about it? Is there anything that Paramchaitanya cannot do? It does every type of work.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThere was a gentleman in Canada. This story, too, is an old one. He wrote a letter to me saying, \xe2\x80\x98Mother, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any money and I need this much money.\xe2\x80\x99 I told him, \xe2\x80\x98It is all right. No problem.\xe2\x80\x99 On the second day he called me. \xe2\x80\x98Mother, I received the money.\xe2\x80\x99 I asked him how. He told me that he opened a drawer and there was money in it. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, my God, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep the money. How did he get the money?\xe2\x80\x99 He said that it was exactly the amount he needed. There were lots of experiences of so many people. So many experiences are still felt because this Paramchaitanya comes in the form of blessings. Everywhere it will bless you, will give you love, will take care of you in every way. Everything is there, but it has moved fast. I Myself can\xe2\x80\x99t understand how it does so much work in a place like America, where people don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sensibility at all in the field of spirituality. One time, there was a big program in such a big hall, people had no place to sit, and people got their realisation in five minutes, just in five minutes. Then the same thing happened in Los Angeles. I was so surprised that the people there are such fools, but it happened with them. Then in Canada, there also they got their realisation in five minutes. Then we went further. There also people got realisation in five minutes. I could not understand what it is and why it is so. The forms of Paramchaitanya have extended so far, its varieties are so many, that no one can understand what the matter is and how it takes place. If somebody asks me, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to say.\n\nNow, somebody clicked my photograph, and I wanted that type of photograph, as people say about Mother that the Moon is in Her Divine Feet and the Sun is on Her head. I wanted that type of photograph, and the photograph taken was exactly the same. Whatever a human being wants, happens. What should we say? Paramchaitanya\xe2\x80\x99s own Shakti knows everyone\xe2\x80\x99s problems and worries, and works out those problems so smoothly, with great love and reverence. Until now you have done Adi Shakti Puja. At that time, you worshipped this Supreme Power called Paramchaitanya and Ruh.\n\nWhen I came here, I saw things happening everywhere and thought that the Devi had already blessed this place in some form or the other. And in fact, such a big and prestigious work was done so quickly and in no time at all, that I could not understand why and how it happened so early. It is that very Paramchaitanya. Now, let us say it is my Shakti only, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know my Shakti. It happened in this way.\xc2\xa0It is happening so fast that I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand what it will do next and what its next move will be. I mean to say, this power is so eager that in this world, whatever the changes, it is a global transformation. There is no delay in doing that, but those who will join it, and those who will work for it, only they will get it.\n\nNow I am going to tell you the same thing about Maharashtra, that this Shakti is working there speedily. And all of you should fully understand this Shakti, its mode of working, and understand it and utilise it accordingly. If you start utilising this power, you can do all kinds of work. If anyone is bothering you, you can give a bandhan to him. For doing any work, you can give a bandhan. Only a bandhan. What do you do in a bandhan is that the Shakti that is flowing inside your being, you wind up that Shakti. And if you have any question, or any problem, you can give a bandhan to that. That Shakti will work out the problem. You have got this Shakti. You are so powerful. If you utilise it, your success will be limitless. But a human being is lost. Even after getting realisation, unless a human being considers it something special, it will be difficult for Sahaj Yoga to spread. In Romania, they had not even heard the name of Adi Shakti. This is what I think. There Sahaj Yoga has spread so far and wide, it is so surprising; there are five thousand Sahaj Yogis in one city. Now they are increasing all the more. The same thing must happen in Maharashtra, and I sometimes am anxious about why it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen in the same way in Maharashtra, and why it is not spreading in the way it should.\xc2\xa0 These are big cities, quite spacious, and this thing has to take place there.\n\nSo, today, a great thing has taken place, that after struggling for twenty-five years, we are in such a situation that you people have come here to give importance to it, to add to its glory and to make it sacred. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the words to say. I think about it and I feel emotional for you people, that you have come here from so far away.\n\nI am sorry I have to speak in this language, because most of the people know only this language and some of them know only Marathi, but they only know simple Hindi language. Sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know French, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, in this life time, I will be able to learn. I have to speak in this language, which you can get\xc2\xa0translated and then understand. I have told them how I came here by chance and found somebody trying to use mesmerism on people. That was the time, I decided, we had to open the Sahastrara, and that is what I did in a very Sahaj manner. I must say that I just desired that now it would be opened. And that is all. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything, and once the Sahastrara was opened, I was amazed to find out how human beings can give realisation to others. Even human beings can give collective realisation. Of course, they have to use the photograph; we can say it is Niralambha, only. Niralambha means that we should not have any Alambhan, depending on anything, but it is Nira, Niralambhan. I am Nira. This is a very confusing word. But this is what it is. You have to use my photograph.\n\nSo far, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anybody who has been able to give up the photograph and call himself a Sahaj Yogi. I don\xe2\x80\x99t compulsorily say, \xe2\x80\x98You must have my photograph,\xe2\x80\x99 but they know the positive side of it. That is why they use it. I have talked so many times about this realisation. That is how you have come to this far-fetched place. Thank you very much.\n\nMay God bless you!\n\nTalk in English:\n\nI am sorry I have to speak in this language because most of the people only know this language. And some of them know only Marathi but they know something about Hindi language that all. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know French and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think in this lifetime I can able to learn. I can speak in this language, which you can get translate it and understand. I told them how I came here since by chance and there I found somebody trying to use mesmerism on people. That was the time I decided we have to open Sahastrara and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I did in a very Sahaj manner. I must say it was just I desire and now Sahastrara might be opened. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything once a Sahastrara was open I was amazed how I also knew how the human being had in realization states.\n\nEven human beings would give collective realization. Of course they have to use photograph, which we can say that is Niralamban. What is Niralamban? Which you should not have any alamban, Niralamban, without any alamban. Depending on anything but it is Nira. Niralamban. I\xe2\x80\x99m Nira so that\xe2\x80\x99s what. It is a very confusing word. So it is what it is. You have to use my photograph. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know so far anybody who has been able to give up the photograph and call himself a Sahaj yogis. They don\xe2\x80\x99t compulsory say you must have my photograph but they know the positive side of it that\xe2\x80\x99s why they use it. And I told so many times about these Realization that\xe2\x80\x99s how you have come this far. I\xe2\x80\x99m very much thankful to you.\n\nMay God Bless You.'
