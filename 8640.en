1995-10-29 Diwali Puja

[translation from Hindi]
I had not even thought that after 25 years, so many sahajyogis would collect in Nargol. When I had come here, I had no idea that Sahasrara would be opened now. I was just thinking that, let us observe the status of man. Man has not yet reached that stage, where he will understand what is self realisation. Although, many saints have given proof of Self realisation, and this knowledge is to a great extent in Maharashtra, because the people who followed the middle path called Nath Panthis, had suggested only one path to be followed for the betterment of oneself and that was of self realisation. I also knew that you cannot get anything without knowing your ownself. But the situation of a human being, I saw at that time was rather strange. The people, they were trying to follow, were not pious. They had no other motive than earning money and when a man’s situation is like that, when he doesn’t recognise truth at all, it is very difficult to tell him about truth and why should people listen to me? Repeatedly, I felt that that man should struggle a little more. But I found that people are torture of Kaliyuga facing very badly. On the one hand, the people who had done good deeds in their previous lives, were being tortured by those who, had done bad deeds. Among those, there were such people also who, were dismayed and were in great distress on account of the karmas of their previous births, and there were also some who, because of their karmas of previous lives, took birth in this world of devils and would never hesitate to torture brutally, pester and degrade, anyone. So, I observed specially two type of people. Those who torture others and those who are tortured.

Now it had to be decided, whom to pay attention. Those who troubled others were egoistic and would think of themselves as perfect persons. They would never imagine that they were troubling and bothering others. And those who were tortured ,were tolerating  may be because of compulsion or may be they didn’t know that they should retaliate those who behave in such a manner. That they should revolt against such people. That time I was thinking, when man will think of transforming himself, transforming his inner being, because both the groups had already reassured themselves. Some people were more troublesome, while others were less, and some people were tolerating more torture ,while others, less. This was the situation of the society, whether it was in the name of God or in the name of nation, whether it was political or economical, someone’s poverty, while someone’s effulence.

So, in this way, a process of decline was going on in this country, which I understood that as long as man doesn’t get transformed, doesn’t recognise himself, as long as he doesn’t obtain his dignity and eminence, till then he will go on acting like that only. This was already in my mind, from my childhood only, and I would think that it is very important to understand a human being. So, first of all I did a lot of study   of human beings by being detached to them, tried to understand them in my witness state, as to what are the faults of their past lives. What are their faults, and why does a human being think like that. Then I reached a conclusion that either a man has too much ego or, superego which, we call as conditioning. Because of both these, he is not balanced. Unless he is balanced, how can kundalini rise? And that too such a Great Thing.

But when I came to Nargol, due to some strange reasons, a very wicked rakhshasa who had set his camp there, sent a word to my husband that I should visit his camp surely. I didn’t like him at all. Even then, I obeyed my husband and went there and most probably, the bunglow I am living in right now, is the same we were living in then. On the previous day, I was sitting under a tree watching their drama, and was so surprised that this person was giving them mantras and mesmerising them. Many people were screeming, shouting, some were barking, and growling like lions. I understood that he was drifting them into their previous life and I got nervous to see, that he was awakening their subconscious mind. I had seen these false gurus earlier also and what they did. It should be known what do they do and how do they do, this business. And I noticed one thing that these people are very much frightened, they would have their guns with them and their guards with them. I thought, if they are doing God’s work, why do they need such things. And they were charging limitless money. They  looted crores of rupees from people by telling lies. These two things were in my mind. I thought that it is the blessing of Kaliyuga, that such people are still thriving. But its only solution is that when man’s consciousness will awaken, he will have pure knowledge and he will understand that all this is untruth and it is useless to follow such things. Third thing I saw that, the society I was living in, every minute, the people were doing all that would lead to their destruction. For example, drinking, running after women, and things like that. And they hanker after money. And while talking, they didn’t seem to be talking in a natural way. They would talk in a strange manner, they would pose and talk dramatically. I would think, what has happened to man, why he is entangled in this drama business and in this way he is doing wrong acts. But whom could I tell. I was all alone.

That time when I came here, the only problem was, what should be done? After coming here when I saw that these rakhshasas were mesmerising people, then I understood that if Sahasrara is not somehow opened now, God knows, where will the people be drifted. As a consequence, the followers, the seekers of God, the seekers of truth, God knows where can they go. Then after noticing this, next day early in the morning, I was at the sea coast for the full night. I was alone and I felt very good. No body to disturb. Then in my meditation, I thought again that let Sahasrara be opened. And as soon as, I desired that let the Bramharandra of Sahasrara be opened now, I saw my Kundalini in my own being, shooting up like a telescope, (khat,  khat, khat. Its colour was like, the combination of all the colours of Diyas (earthen pots) that you have lit here. Just as iron gets hot in furnace, its colour, then I saw the outer yantra of that kundalini was rising up and up and up.  At every chakra there was a noise (khat, khat, Khat ) and Kundalini pierced Bramharandra. My piercing didn’t matter. But I saw that it will be now easier in the universe. And at that time I felt, that some power whatever it was, dawned into my inner being and cool breeze came from all around me. Now I understood, that there is no harm in starting my work, because whatever complications were there were over. With full confidence, I thought that now the time had come.

After all what will happen? At best the people will kill me, beat me, at best they will laugh at me, make fun of me, and after that they will kill everybody. There is nothing to be scared of. This has to be done. I have come to this world for this purpose only. Because I have to invoke collective consciousness, I thought that unless people get self realisation, don’t know their own self, it is impossible to achieve my goal. We may do all other things, it is all useless. So first of all, I experimented it with a very old lady, who had lot of faith in me, got her self realisation. Then I was confident. I thought that at least one person has got realisation. In this Kaliyuga, is it easy to give realisation to any one? When one person got realisation, I thought that it is possible that many will get so. And it was easy to give realisation collectively. It was easy to give realisation to one person. It was easy to pay attention to one person. But for the collective realisation, whatever I had experienced about human beings, there was still some more work to be done. It was, What should be done, when I fnd that somebody has any bad quality, or has some trouble, or is conditioned. Because, one person had one problem, another, a different problem and a third person a third problem. If collective work is to be done, just with one awakening, everybody should be benefitted. It should be helpful to everyone. Right now, because of the shortage of time, I cannot make you understand that till date, this collective realisation work which had not been done by anyone, was done by me with the help of lot of deep meditation.

Rotating my kundalini all around, using my kundalini repeatedly to influence others and nobody knew what powers I had inside me. Who am I? Nobody knew. Nobody in our house knew. And nobody knew in my in-laws house too. In my parents’ house too nobody knew. And I never told anybody. Because, it is not easy to put it in their heads. Because man’s brain is such that it Is very difficult to thrust any thought into it. Everybody is egoistic, everybody feeling self importance.Now who will tell them? As Kabir has said,” How shall I make understand the whole world,’’ I feel is not blind but is ignorant, absolutely a huge collection of ignorance. And how to transmit this subtle knowledge?

When the kundalini of that lady, that Devi got awakened, I noticed that she got subtle knowledge. And she started understanding me with the help of that subtle knowledge. After that 12 people got realisation. And after getting realisation, were surprised because their eyes sparkled absolutely. And they started seeing everything. They started experiencing some strange change inside their being.  In the beginning, I worked on all the chakras individually of the first twelve people, because elements give strength to its foundation and we have to struggle hard for making it strong. Although, their kundalini had awakened, but you know that even after the kundalini is awakened, we have to meditate to take it into right direction and it has to be settled down. I worked very hard for these twelve people. As a result, I understood that if the twelve behaviours of these twelve people are somehow synchronised, how can the power of the enlightened soul be organised. Just as we thread flowers into a needle, how can that totality be obtained. How can the different behaviours of these twelve people be synchronised into one common formula? And when they got their realisation, I saw that by and by, all of them were getting integrated internally. I had to work even harder a little. But I thought, that to tell somebody, to tell people in general about it, was not so easy. It is not for the people to understand. Then a programme was organised in Jahangir Hall. There I said, how many rakhshasas came and how many rakhshasnis came. What will they  do? Everybody got frightened. They started telling that if Mataji talks in this way, how will anyone help Her? All of them advised me not to talk in that manner, otherwise there will be a great problem. I told them,” Till now my killer is not born and you be free of worry.’’

By and by, I told these small streams inside everybody and small rivers of Kundalini,’’ You concentrate on my Kundalini.’’ And they became thoughtless, the moment they started to meditate. And the moment they became thoughtless, they felt that they have lot of identity with me. By and by, there was more and more thoughless  awareness. By and by, there was more focus on collectivity. This I saw first of all in Jahangir Hall. Hindustanis, Indians, have taken birth on this land because they are very religious minded. They must have lived a noble life. Because in India, we don’t have to work so hard. In no time people would get realisation. Of course in the beginning it took a little more time. But in foreign countries, hands get tired. To raise one’s kundalini is just like lifting a mountain and then it falls down with a bump. Raise and then fall down with a bump. And then a great difficulty in collectivity, asking weird questions, this and that and all worldly talks. When I would answer their questions, they would get surprised. How does SHE know all this! How does SHE have knowledge about all this? Examine me a lot, because of lot of ego.

Now by and by, such things, like in London, first time, seven sahajyogis came. All of them were like hippies and drug addicts. They transformed into sahajyogis. It meant that, I got some support in a way, and I was confident that in sahajyoga people are denouncing drugs.

 It is not so easy to position a drug addict. Out of this, one good  experience was gained that even a most difficult person must get connected and must have the knowledge of his own self, when he desires. He gets his self realisation simply by desiring it. Then I would tell everyone, to desire for self realisation by heart. That only helped them to get their self realisation. I have got   experiences of many countries e.g., Russia, Ukrein or Rumania. These countries, I feel, must have been in some close contact with our countries sometime in the past. And Nath Panthies, Machendra Nath, Gorakh Nath must have visited these countries from here. Because, Whatever I got from their countries, I could understand that these people had knowledge of Kundalini even three hundred years before the birth of Christ. Then I understood, how these people get their self realisation so quickly.

Nath Panthies worked a lot in Maharashtra and I too worked very hard. But I feel  disappointed, that whatever  work I could do in north India, could not be done in Maharashtra even now. I can’t understand, that the place where saints have shed their blood, and every Maharashtrian knows, what work Nath Panthies have done. And don’t know why, what I achieved in north India, could not be achieved in Maharashtra. In the beginning, I would call Delhi as Billy. There also I worked very hard, but I was very much surprised  to see  the sahajyogis I find there and the way sahajyoga is spreading there. Seeing this flow, I am so surprised that the place where so many saints worked so hard and since our childhood, we have learnt and studied, here everybody is telling the same thing that in this Maharashtra sahajyoga didn’t spread so much as it has in the north. What can be the reason? I feel, when everything is already known, it is not respected. It is treated with indifference. There is a shalok in Sanskrit, “Ati Parichayat  Avaghya’ Santat Gamana  Anadaro Bhavati, Prayagvasi Kripe Sananam Samacharet.’ It means that when you go anywhere repeatedly, meet a person, frequently, you are disrespected. Then, you lose your respect. Because people of Prayag, Allahabad, instead of taking bath in Gangaji, which is the meeting point of three rivers called Triveni, take bath with water drawn from the well of their home, whereas people all over the world, go there to take their bath. May be, this is the reason that sahajyoga has so much recognition in north  India.  Here also it is not that there is shortage of sahajyogis. There are lot of sahajyogis in Maharashtra, and are practising it, but I never found them having the  dedication that is required towards sahajyoga. May be that it will increase. Dedication means, to know how to utililise the sahajyogi status that has been   given to us. I can’t understand if, they think only of their benefit, their own problems, of their own families or for the whole world. Inspite of the culture of Maharashtra and such a deep impression of their religion, Sahajyoga has not spread to that extent. And in Gujrat, in Nargol, where I opened Bramharandra, there is all the more problem. I can’t understand the people of Gujrat. I worked very hard in Gujrat, but I worked hard most in Maharashtra. Today ,there are many Maharashtrians here, I want to say that to spread sahajyoga, first of all  you meditate and go deep. When you attain that depthness, then you feel, ‘Why should only I enjoy its blessings, let other people also do so. When you get this feeling, Sahajyoga spreads. Day and night the same thought gives a lot of pleasure.

Today I am happy that people from all over the world have come here, and many others have come from foreign countries,  from Delhi etc., at least I feel , is a matter of happiness for me, that how all of you reached such a rough place? It is all blessing of love. It is all your love. It is a great thing. But the only difference is that   in Kolahpur, we worked very hard, but there sahajyoga has established   very little. It is so surprising, why it is so? They told me that there are eight hundred sahajyogis in Pandarpur, but it is not so there. If we go to Gaziabad, there are fifteenteen thousand, in Faridabad there are sixteen thousand and then in Haryana there are twenty five thousand. There they are in thousands and in Maharashtra, they are eight hundred here, five hundred there and seven hundred there. What is the reason, I could not understand till date. If this has to be thought, we can think that here, self knowledge, self realisation, and a clan having knowledge of minutest things etc., so much has taken place in reality that now there  is no  attention towards this. As such in Maharashtra, they don’t have any yearning for money, as you find in Gujrat and even in Uttar Pradesh. In north India there is lot of longing for money. It is not so in Maharashtra. Praying to God from morning till evening , getting up early in the morning at 4 a.m, doing this ,doing that is agreeable. But, it is all mechanical. Do it by heart, do it with devotion and try to share that devotion. Maharashtrians must  follow it. I agree that we have our Ganpatipule programmes in Maharashtra only, for all the  twelve months and there are very good sahajyogis in Maharashtra. Deep! Very deep! The Yuva Shakhti of this place too is very good. Still I would appreciate the extent to which it has spread in north. Now you see my in-laws are in Barah Banki.  Every place, every village, every where, where there has reached just one person, has become a sahajyogi place, Just like a minor spark in the dry wood causes it to fire.  After all what makes it to flow so forcefully, can’t understand, and whosoever gets it, doesn’t have any question. But in Maharashtra, they have asked a lot of questions, because they have already read lot of books. In the houses, daily each, just see, any Maharashtrian has at least the photographs of ten gurus. Out of those the real gurus may be one or two only. And there are statues of every type. It is the land of Ganesha. Four Ganeshjis are sitting here, should be said like that. But it is called Ashtvinayak. I am telling four because, two aspects or characteristics of each Ganesha are specially different here. Now Maharashtrians know about that. They go there, do Ganesh puja. Then here three Devis are much in recognition. Even then, they will go there. They will go to temples. Daily they will go to Maha laxmi temple. All that they will do. And now they are in Sahajyoga, now there is nothing to do. This is very surprising.

Today many Maharashtrians have come here and I wanted to say, that numberless people have come from Delhi, so many people will never go from Maharashtra. In Marathi they are called Gharkonbde. It seems they can be found in their own country only. The people of Bombay you will never find in Poona doing any work and the people of Poona are in a way glued like a rakhshasa. I am saying so, because sometimes by saying all this openly, the problem gets solved. I have to say openly, that, Aathvale are better than Sahajyogis in Maharashtra. They talk uselessly, but they have accumulated lakhs of people.  Hardly to say anything about Gujrat. They are under the influence of gurus. But what happened to Maharashtrians? Where Ramdas Swami has talked about all gurus and has said, not only this, I shall tell everyone to pay their attention, for the past so many years explained sahajyoga. Daily they sing, and what Namdev has written the song of Jogwa, that you sing daily, ‘Mother please give us yoga’. But for that yoga you have to do something. You go to any village, lot of people will collect there, when I go there. After that even if two people will meet, you will be surprised. So, I would like to say that Maharashtrians should pray for these people. They can do Havana, some such collective programma, so that there will be awakening in Maharashtra as it is in north India, in Russia. As such they are very much devoted, but I can’t understand why does not sahajyoga spread there. It is spreading at a very slow pace. In Kolahpur there have been many pujas. Devi’s temple is very beautiful.Every thing is there. But there is not so much depth. For that people should pay attention collectively because Maharashtra is a very big city. Very prestigious city, and whatever it is from the point of dharma, but spiritually it is very prestigious. So, everybody should talk about the awakening of Maharashtra. There is no such quarrel, no problem, but Sahajyoga has not spread as it should have. May be it will be alright in future.

I don’t know, how I had this strange perception that how so many of you came here. How so many of you came to such a small place after twenty five years. I Worked very hard.  But it is not surprising  to observe that in such a small place, so many people  understood the importance of spiritualism after twenty five years.

Nargol in Sahajyoga means Sahastrara. And when I came here, saw the blessings of forest etc., felt so happy and had a feeling in my heart, that we have come to a very blessed place of nature. It was the month of May and I was not feeling the heat of summer at all. When sahajyogis come, I absorb their heat, but here, there were no sahajyogis, I didn’t feel any heat and when I opened Sahasrara, I found that people don’t have any knowledge about it. Mostly ,they were Gujratis, Maharashtrians were few. And in  Maharashtra only, the books, so many books that they have written, They have written Holy books, not the tales, Whatever they have written is truth, it is written on chakras, on Kundalini, even after having been written so much, even after having acquired so much knowledge, if they utilise this, it will spread limitlessly.

Sahajyoga can spread here to a great extent. Now, that our system of Sahajyoga has spread and is so deep, you must have understood from the drama that you watched. In this drama they showed with the help of their brain, ‘why Mother came?’ and everybody said that they worked very hard. We tried our best to divert a human being towards spiritualism and let his attention be towards God and somehow let him get realisation, but it didn’t work. So we are now telling the Goddess, that you please incarnate. You incarnate and set right the world that You have created. This is absolutely right. There is no doubt about it and it has happened like that and it has formed like that. All the work is going on so smoothly  and when Sahasrara was broken, had not even thought that in my life time, that I will be able to see all this work done in my life time, but it is the work of the greatness of this Kundalini and Param Chaitanya. I am myself up in arms, of this Param Chaitanya, don’t know what it is doing. Although, it is my Shakti, but you are witnessing that this Param Chaitanya is creating my photographs of various types, is showing varieties of miracles, almost fifty types of miracles. There was a maxican lady, working in New York. I met her there. After that she got her realisation too and went to Mexico. There she got a job in U.N. She wrote a letter to me that her son is sick. He is very small by age and this disease, is hereditary in their clan , when people become very old ,but this child has inherited it at such a small age and now he cannot survive. She has written to me three such letters. I am talking about Param Chaitanya, and in her fourth letter she wrote that the child is ok now by himself. He was studying in hardware University and was absolutely alright. He got cured of his disease absolutely. Doctor asked him, ’What did you do?’ ‘How did you get well?’ So there is no better doctor than this and the way   Param Chaitanya works, is surprising.  Now, somebody asked, ‘What is this, does Ganeshji take milk?’ I said,’ This Param Chaitanya has come in Krita yuga and if it gets some work, it does and whatever it does is less.  There are hundreds of jobs to be done. They will feed milk to Ganeshji, feed milk to Shivji. Can we say anything to It! Is there anything that Param Chaitanya cannot do? It does every type of work.

There was a gentleman in Canada. This story too is an old one. He wrote a letter to me, Mother, I don’t have any money and I need this much money for it.’ I told him, ’It is ok. No problem.’ Second day he called me, ‘Mother, I got the money.’ I asked him how? He told me that he opened the drawer and there was money. I said, ‘Oh my God, I didn’t keep the money. How did he get the money?’ He said that it was exactly the amount, he needed. There were lot of experiences of so many people. So many experiences are still felt because this Param Chaitanya comes in the form of blessings. Every where it will bless you, will give you love, will take care of you in every way, everything is there, but it has gained speed, in its movement, I myself can’t understand ,how it does so much of work. In a place like America, where people don’t have any sensibility at all in the field of spirituality. This time, there was such a big programme in such a big hall, people had no place to sit, and people got their realisation in five minutes, just in five minutes. Then same thing happened in Los Angeles. I was so surprised that the people there are such fools, but how did it happen with them? Then in Canada, there also they got their realisation in five minutes.

Then we went further, there also people got realisation in five minutes. Could not understand, what is it and why is it so? The forms of Param Chaitanya have extended so much, its varieties are so much, that no one can understand what is the matter and how does it take place. If somebody asks me, I won’t be able to say. Now, somebody clicked my photo and I want that, as people say about Mother, that Moon is in Her Divine feet and Sun is on Her head. I want that type of photo and exactly the photo clicked was just the same. Whatever a human being wants, happens. What should we say?  Param Chaitanya’s own Shakti Knows everyone’s problems, worries and works out those problems, so smoothly,  with great love and reverence. ………Till now you have done Adi Shakti Puja, at that time only, you have worshipped this Supreme Power called Param Chaitanya and Ruh.

When I came here, I saw the outbreak of it everywhere and thought, that Devi has already blessed this place in some form or the other. And in fact, such a big and prestigious work was done so quickly and in no time, that I could not understand, why and how it happened so early. It is that very Param Chaitanya. Now let us say, it is my Shakti only, but I only don’t know my Shakti. It has happened so.  It is running at such a fast pace, that I can’t understand, what will it do next and what will be its next move. I mean to say that this power is so eager, so much hankering, that in this world whatever the changes are there, it is global transformation. It makes no delay in doing that, but those who will join it, and those who will work for it, only they will get it.

Now I am going to tell you the same thing about Maharashtra, that this Shakti is working there speedily. And all of you should know fully, understand this Shakti, its mode of working and understand it and you can utilise it accordingly. If you start utilising this power, you can do each and every work. If anyone is bothering you, you can give bandhan to him. For doing any work, you can give bandhan. Only bandhan, and what do you do in bandhan, is that the Shakti that is flowing inside your being, you wind up that Shakti. And if you have any question, or any problem, you can give bandhan to that. That Shakti will work out that problem. You have got this Shakti. You are so powerful. If you utilise it, your bounties of success will be limitless. But a human being is lost. Even after getting realisation, unless a human being considers it something special, it will be difficult for Sahajyoga to spread. A country named Rumania, they had not even heard the name of Adi Shakti. This is what I think! There Sahajyoga has spread so far and wide, is so surprising, that there are five thousand Sahajyogis in one city. Now they are all the more on the increase. The same thing must happen in Maharashtra and off and on, I am anxious about it, that why doesn’t it happen so in Maharashtra. Why is it not spreading in the manner it should.  These are big cities, quite spacious, this thing has to take place there.

So, today, a great thing has taken place, that after struggling for twenty five years, we are in such a situation, that you people have come here, to give importance to it, to add to its glory and to make it sacred. I am just short of words. I think about it and I feel emotional for you people, that from what a distance you have come here.

I am sorry, I have to speak in this language, because most of the people know only this language and some of them know only Marathi, but they only know simple Hindi language. Sorry, I don’t know French, and I don’t think, in this life time, I will be able to learn. I have to speak in this language, which you can get  translated and understand. I have told them, how I came here was by chance and there I found somebody trying to use mesmerism on people. That was the time, I decided, we have to open the Sahasrara and that is what I did in a very sahaj manner. I must say, just I desired, that now, it be opened. And that is all. Ididn’t do anything, and once the Sahasrara was opened, I was amazed, how I also knew, how human beings can give realisation to others. Even human beings could give collective realisation. Of course, they have to use the photograph, which we can say, that it is Niralambha, only. Nirlambha means, that we should not have any Alambhan, depending on anything, but it is Nira, Niralambhan. I am Nira. This is a very confusing word. But this is what it is. You have to use my photograph.

I don’t know so far  anybody who has been able to give up the photograph and call himself sahajyogi.I don’t compulsorily say, you must have my photograph, but they know the positive side of it. That is why, they use it. I have told so many times, about this realisation. That is how, you have come to this farfetched place. I am very much thankful to you.

May God bless you.
