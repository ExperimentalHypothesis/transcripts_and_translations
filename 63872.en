Conversation with Sahaja Yogis, Mulhouse, France, 1er September 1983

Like the Father created the world, the Son showed how to resurrect, but the Mother then nourishes, actually, and makes you something, the owner of the whole thing. So, first the God almighty, the father, then the Spirit in the heart, and then now, the Kundalini.So, after you become one with the Spirit, you become the Spirit. And the powers that the Spirit had before start manifesting in you. So, this is at this consciousness, that we have to rise. The problem is we move in a pendulum, from this to that, like from one extreme to another extreme. But the movement of consciousness is spiral, it moves in a spiral, like the Kundalini. And so, the Mother who is loving, very gently, very kindly, affectionately, manifests her beauty of nourishment.This kind of unconsciousness I want to work out, because we are a computer in that, say, a server DD, a computer. And another computer, the one we are producing, actually, is our reflection.Sahaja Yogi: Would you say it again Mother.Shri Mataji: You see, we are producing computers outside. They are the reflection of ourselves outside.Sahaja Yogi: They are the reflection of us as we are the reflection of God.Shri Mataji: So, whatever we reflect is artificial, man-made. And I was reading an article today, and the gentleman said that thousands and thousands of computer we may use, we cannot reach the computer that is our own innate intelligence.

[Conversation with Sahaja Yogis about the translation in French) [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Now, you were doing all right. But just to create a bit of humour. Tell them that, “Mother said that we were too serious, it is just to create a bit of humour”.Sahaja Yogi (about the translator): You become like a computer. [Laughter].Shri Mataji: So, what said, he said, “When you are seeing something, you don’t think about it. You just see the ego if it is there. You don’t think about it.So, you have to go to that sate where you don’t think, you just see it. That’s what he would like to say. But he said, “Tis cannot be done. Because the computer that human beings have produced is the result of that thinking”. I can say the same thing as my own words.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, absolutely.

So, the whole thing is that we have to recognize that within us lies that power. But to raise our consciousness also, even to raise our consciousness, it can be only done through the grace of God, because human beings cannot do it. And once somebody gets that grace, you can do it. But the grace is the quality of the Mother. Because people are worried all over the world about the consciousness.But here in Mulhouse, I may not make it subtler, but I’ll tell them that these powers are available within you. Because I don’ want to churn their brains, like Mulhouse, you see, churns the brain [The name of the city of Mulhouse means the house of the mill]. But I must tell you, the intellectuals and the stupid ego-oriented people, really churn my brain sometimes, it might break! [Laughter]. They want to go like this, like that, like that, you see. God know what their movement is. The best of it is that we are bracketed with sects, so when we are absolutely against them.

On three days in Geneva, people from various sects came to oppose me and shouted at me. Because they found it dangerous, because I speak against them. But they never speak against themselves, against each other. They are all big friends. Christ has said, “The Satan won’t speak against his own house”.Sahaja Yogi: But still, they put us together with these people.Shri Mataji: But there also, I speak about [interruption], I tell about the sects, the horrible things against them. So that, next time, you can show this to your television people. They won’t have any objections. And they’ll like me.Sahaja Yogi: When Mother rather speak openly against the sects-Shri Mataji: Openly.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, just imagine, in the local papers, you are put alongside a class of school children who are learning martial art and judo. Girls, not boys, girls.Shri Mataji: Is it an offspring of Zen?Sahaja Yogi: In a way, yes. It can be put to positive purposes, but unfortunately, they don’t emphasise the philosophy, they emphasise the physical part and the violence. It’s a means of self-defence and it’s taught as self-defence, in a very aggressive way.

Shri Mataji: Very good, this food was. She has never given me these sandwiches and I said, “No, I’ must have my last lunch in Mulhouse. I must have”.

This is German, German thing [porcelain]? But Germany is so close.Sahaja Yogis: No, no, no. [In French: it might be from Limoges]Shri Mataji: It must be German, the style is. It’s so close, Germany, yes? We went to Freiburg and Basel last time.Sahaja Yogini: From Germany, from Bavaria.Sahaja Yogis: Bavaria.Shri Mataji: It’s Germany.Marie: Yes.Shri Mataji: Bavaria is North Germany?Marie: South. So, München, it’s the south really.Shri Mataji: South.Marie: Yes. It’s closer to Austria.Shri Mataji: Austria, in between.Marie: It’s North of Austria. Same style of mountains, near Hungary.Shri Mataji: In Austria, there is one big hill, or we can say, in Vienna, there’s a very big mountainous area. And this is the area which is in between Germany and Austin.Sahaja Yogi: Is it the Tyrol, Mother? the Austrian Tyrol?Shri Mataji: And this place was used by the Germans. Then they occupied Austria.Sahaja Yogi: It’s the Tyrol.Shri Mataji: Yes. And there now, you see, I think some Germans must have died, or whatever it is, a funny type of a fly is there. In that thing, that no one wants to go inside the forest because if the fly bites you, you can be faintedSahaja Yogi: My God.

Shri Mataji: [Marathi].It’s a German fly, I think.[Marathi conversation]. There must be some dead spirit or something, I don’t know. A horrible fly is there. So, nobody goes inside the forest. Must be some devils, I’m sure.

Sahaja Yogini: All the devils come from this 15th century.Shri Mataji: Turkish invasion.Yes, I saw that. Turkish influence is quite a lot in architecture.Sahaja Yogini: And the little bread that we ate in the morning, you see, that we call ‘croissant’,Maire: The ‘croissant’ shape one.Shri Mataji: Yes. Croissant, comes from them.Ah!Marie: They were made to celebrate the victory over the Turks.Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Croissant, we eat it.Marie: So, when the Muslims leave then you eat their symbol. Put it in your coffee and eat it Shri Mataji: Must be. Because the Turkish influence is too much in the architecture. I was surprised.

[Conversation in French.]Shri Mataji: And Turkey itself now is in a big mess, Turkey.Very poor.

Shri Mataji: Kemal Pasha was a good man.[Foreign language conversation]Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?Translator: He was asking if Atatürk was also a good man.Shri Mataji: Who?Translator: Atatürk.Shri Mataji: Atatürk. Imagine, so he was also a Realized soul Kemal Pasha, Atatürk.

Shri Mataji: You see, but Realized souls have no place in religious activity. No one accepted them.Sahaja Yogi: They couldn't get a place, because nobody would have accepted them.Shri Mataji: I was telling them that Mc Enroe is a Realized soul. Borg is. Two styles. But both are. And Mc Enroe is a person, always in [unclear], he tells himself, "John, behave yourself ". He always talks in a third person. But he can’t bear the that people trying to insult him. Because, you see, it's too much for a Realized soul to bear insult from a person who is not even a Spirit.So, this time, I told them that I heard, I read in the paper, that he's a- somebody tried to say something to him sarcastically many a time. So, he threw some sawdust and he was asked to leave the court. And he was given punishment for that and he cannot pray now for some time. But it's very sad.Because how many people he entertains, makes them happy, joyous? And one horrible mosquito-like fellow comes from there and tries, tries to disturb the play, disturb the thing and you can't say anything to him because –Because under the democratic law, you must treat everyone equally and tolerate everybody's nonsense equally.Look, I was speaking yesterday I have not even finished my speech, and one man got up and he started speaking so loudly, insulting me. And he went out and there were people trying to sympathize with him that he must have his saying. Now who is he? I mean, I've not yet finished my lecture.[Hindi conversation]

So, this is like Mc Enroe, I feel. [Laughter]I'm sorry for him, really. My granddaughter always supports him, the little one. So, her mother said, "Why do you always support Mc Enroe?" She said, "Because he's a Realized soul!"

And the elder one is really, very subtle. Aradna, very intelligent and subtle. So, she told me that, "You know why both has retired?" So, I said, "I don't know". "It's very simple because he's a Realized soul, Mc Enroe is a Realized soul. So both does not want to go into competition with another Realized soul".It’s very- children understand truth so well, for they are not complicated.

Oh, I’ll be able to manage.

Come and have some. I think, you also have lunch.Marie: We had.Shri Mataji: Hum?Marie: We had lunch.Shri Mataji: Where?Marie: On the road. We had a big sandwich.Shri Mataji: What about the students, they had? I don’t know if they had. Have they prepared for it or you can go and have lunch.You can go and have it somewhere. There are men they can go and have it somewhere.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, we can go outside.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] Where dd you have?Marie: We've made sandwiches before we left, Mother.Sahaja Yogi: They came by car.Marie: We left them in the car, and then we stopped somewhere on the motorway for a drink.Shri Mataji: No but these people can go and have some lunch.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, we'll go outside.Shri Mataji: Better go, I think.

At what time is the program?Sahaja Yogini: 7:30 pm.Shri Mataji: How far is the hall?Sahaja Yogini: Fifteen minutes, maybe.Shri Mataji: Only?Sahaja Yogini: At least.Shri Mataji: So that’s very close. So, somebody will give an introduction in French, I think maybe, anyone who feels like.Sahaja Yogini: I think, Shri Mataji, we will wait for Arnaud’s arrival.Shri Mataji: And then he can translate.Marie: Who’s, translating, Mother?Shri Mataji: You can try, you can translate.Marie: All right, Mother.

[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: It was too much.Sahaja Yogi: Tomorrow, midday time.Shri Mataji: Yes.Sahaja Yogi: He is doing the interview. And he will come where you are, with the material.Shri Mataji: Two o'clock?Interviewer: All right.Sahaja Yogi: Or half past two.Shri Mataji: Yes. Here, today.Sahaja Yogi: No tomorrow.Shri Mataji: What time are we going?Sahaja Yogini: About six, Shri Mataji, six pm.Shri Mataji: Very good.Sahaja Yogini: I will look again.Sahaja Yogi: Could you, please, give us - The interview will be recorded and it will be-Interviewer: It will be pre-recorded and broadcasted later.Shri Mataji: Pre-recorded.Sahaja Yogini: Two days after.Shri Mataji: That’s good for radio.Sahaja Yogi: It’s the radio from Mulhouse. It’s a local radio.Sahaja Yogi: It was not possible to get an earlier.Shri Mataji: It’s all right. But you please see, that he asked me questions about all the sects and what they do.Sahaja Yogi: Excuse me, Mother. You want that that question-Shri Mataji: That gentleman who comes to interview me.Sahaja Yogi: He will.Shri Mataji: He will, all right. Then you ask questions about these sects and what they do, how they make money. And how with that, people get sick. And how it happens people get cancer, this, that.Sahaja Yogi: This tape will help the future publicity.

Shri Mataji: And you should also ask a question, "Why you're against all the sects?" That’s a better question, to begin with. And also then, you should also ask him, "What is the difference between a sect and Sahaja Yoga?" It’s a good idea.

Marie: He intended to.Sahaja Yogi: He thought about it.Shri Mataji: Just attack and ask them all the tricks, you see? What they do, what they have really, you don't know how much they have extracted, not only the money, but also the real being itself is being just sucked.Sahaja Yogi: The questions that he will ask you, are the questions of the public. It will be the questions from the public, because he got a lot of phone calls, at the announcement in the Press. People asking, "But what is Sahaja Yoga? Is that a new sect or what is it about?"Shri Mataji: But more, sort of, directed towards the subtler side of a sect. Because I can tell them what they are doing, how they are doing. Like, you see, somebody who proclaims that he can make the people fly, you can ask me. Somebody says he's Christ, he can walk out on the water. Then there is another one, like that you see, I'll tell you about all of them what they say and how to make it out. Now, without taking names, so there's no [unclear].You see, like some people give up their parents like the Monies you see, making them taking away from their parents and they are taking out work from them, using them for his own purpose. Then the Monies, you see. Like Scientology is banned London because it produced results by which people became mad, you see. He’s banned, now. The fellow is not allowed to come there. Also, I think, he is discovered here also.Marie: Actually he's got a booming business in France and in Switzerland.Shri Mataji: Is he?Marie: Yes. They've been denounced that business is still going.Shri Mataji: From religion, he earned out of religion and now put it in the business. [Laughter].Sahaja Yogi: Religion, it’s horrible, it’s not religion.Shri Mataji: So-called. It's called a church.Marie: And he uses the cross, it's called Church of Scientology, with a cross.

Shri Mataji: What business is he doing Marie? What business is he doing?Marie: Well, I know that in Rosa, and I went to visit with Raimond their center. And he's gone to visit another center. Also they have a very nice flat quite expensive and very big and they advertise quite a lot for programs and purification sessions and psychological tests of course. And in Paris they have a center and they put little leaflets in letterboxes quite regularly. They're about the only cult who actually goes around putting papers in letterboxes in France.Shri Mataji: Now we, not the cult, we do.Marie: Well, if they do, we certainly should.

Shri Mataji: Horrible. But from London they have been thrown away for what reason? Do you know why they were thrown away from England completely? The Scientology people, what was he reason?Marie: No. We’ll have to find out, actually. Cause in France, they're spreading. They have a library and actually, a kindergarten. They've started a ‘crèche’. They've started a ‘crèche’ in Paris.Shri Mataji: What I'm saying that we must find out why, what was the reason for Mr Hubbard, what was the legal thing that happened that she was not allowed to stay.

Sahaja Yogini [to Shri Mataji]: Yoghurt with honey.Shri Mataji: Thank you. I’ll have it with cheese also.Shri Mataji: Not yoghurt. Because I speak so much that I can afford to eat anything like that now. I ate it in one previous life, I should say.Sahaja Yogini: So, some cheese [fresh cheese].Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon? No fat cheese. Because in France, one must eat cheese. [Laughter][Hindi conversation]

Shri Mataji: Here, we don’t eat yoghurt and fish. We don’t eat fish and yogurt in India. Because that gives you those rashes on the body. Because fish is hot, the phosphorus, and the yoghurt is a cooling thing. So, the combination makes it like that.Sahaja Yogi: So, you don’t eat it together.Shri Mataji: You can cook it together, but you won't have- first you'll have- say, supposing you have fish, then you won't have a yogurt.Marie: He says it is a question of allergy and it changes from one individual to another.Shri Mataji: No, mostly people who are allergic, specially, they get too much worse [unsure]. But it can give troubles to some people because those who have allergies, if they eat fish, they're more prone to it. Fish, you see, they get allergic to fish. And on top of that, if you suddenly take yogurt, then it's completely imbalanced and they get a very big rash. But normally, it is always also with others.Actually, the combination, because the left-sided person is a cool [cold] person. So, such a person is always allergic to proteins, because proteins are heat-giving. So, he can be allergic to any protein as such. Also, you see, viruses, all those things also are not actually proteins, but they are some sort of a, you can say, discarded vegetables or which have gone out of the circulation of evolution. So, even when they attack, you see, a cold person, these allergies will act.

In Sahaja Yoga, we have two types of people, one is with a cold livre, one with a hot liver. In Sahaja Yoga, we have two types of people, basically, a hot liver and a cold liver. Like two patients, you can say. Normal people don’t have this kind of things. They have a normal liver. But French are mostly hot liver patients. You are not and Patrick also, even Geneviève is not. But Patrick ‘wife is, this great Australian is, they have a hot liver. Australians also because they eat such a lot of proteins! Meet all the time. And Indians eat too much of carbohydrates, that's not good also.

Marie: He says why do French people have a hot liver?Shri Mataji: Cheese.Sahaja Yogi: Alcohol?Shri Mataji: Of course. They think too much, very complicated. Very difficult diplomats. Very difficult for small things, you see, that now you see this [unclear]. They will say, "This is not to be used for water". Then you bring another glass, they’ll say, "No. this cannot be used for this water from a spring". Then they will say, "We could we bring another glass?" They’ll say, "No". [Cut in the audio.]Then you bring another glass. Then they will ask you, " Which side of the spring you are standing, right or left?" By that you have to have a different glass. Then you bring two glasses. Then they will say, "No, this is from the centre". Then you bring another glass, [Shri Mataji is laughing] and you go mad with your [unclear], you see? I mean, you have to drink the water not the glass! That’s why French diplomats are terrible! There’s a way to delude them is never to offer anything that is French. Never to have anything in the house that is French. So, they won’t be pestering you on that. But to tell them that, " This carpet is as old as 5000 years from India, from Timbuktu", you see. They'll believe it. But they’ll ask them ten questions about this carpet. But you must make a cut in the carpet, otherwise they will never believe also. [Laughter]

Marie: He says then Mr Talleyrand could not be a Realized soul.Shri Mataji: Who?Marie: Talleyrand was a diplomat a minister of Napoleon who represented France in the Congress of Vienna in 1815.Shri Mataji: He might be because vibrations are there. But that must be some exception to keep the rules. [Laughter]And their wives, they are very serious women, all the time an expression as if something is something very serious has happened somewhere. Very worried, very worried.

So, you ask them, "What’s the problem?" "I’m worried about my mother because she's so tolerant of my father. And because my mother was so tolerant of my grandmother and of all her sisters". But I said, "How can you help her by this kind of a worry?" "Oh, only thing, I can go on telling my husband that I’m worried". And the husband is worried about the glass! [Laughter] Such nice time here. I mean, they are the ‘cream’ [of the society]. All of them will have dinner if you invite them. Of course, you must invite them to the best restaurant, no question, with all French ‘cuisine’ and French things around which they eat every day. But at the table, worse than a conference, they’ll sit for one hour discussing; "What will you have? What will I have?" And the host will be taking up his neck about two feet with anxiety, "Now, what will you have?" It’s very funny. For one hour! Out of the one hour and half we have for lunch, one hour is [inaudible; Shri Mataji is laughing]. They are not eating, just eating the discussion.Sahaja Yogi: Out of the menu.Shri Mataji: Ah, ‘preba’. Then the wine. Then, "What wine?" And it’s such a problem, I tell you. My husband has to host, imagine, who does not drink at all. And his plight is such that he is asked first, he has to taste, you see, because the host has to taste first, if the wine is all right. And he doesn’t know from one wine to even any other alcohol, like anything, it’s to him, it’s just the same. This way, he has learnt, you know, how to do it. So, I told him that, "How does it taste?" He told me, "It tastes like – supposing you have some cork in the water,Marie: Some 'what'?Shri Mataji: Cork. [Shri Mataji is laughing]. And you buy some [inaudible] to suck it. You suck their cotton [unsure]. Then, "What is the taste you get? " "It’s rotten cotton", he said. That is the taste you get. But I said, "Why did you taste the cork?" "But I didn’t know the taste of a cork at all of a rotten cork".

"Though, he said, in my childhood you see, I was trying, one day, to open a bottle which was closed for many days, you see. And I couldn’t open it. So, I used my mouth to open it and I got a horrible smell that time and I vomited for six, seven days. And I have to do it every time to say, ‘It’s ‘très bien’ [very good]". I tell you, but the way they discuss about food, is just [mad]. It takes so much time. This is ego to take a decision about every little nonsense, whether you will have fish on the toast or toast on the fish. [Shri Mataji is laughing]. So much time on this, intelligent people wasted.

Marie: He says in France, all the business, all the big discussions, all the decisions are taken around the restaurant table.Shri Mataji: But actually, mainly, it is what they are going to eat. So, I'm sure it must be creating a mess in the business also. Because, you see, when you are doing some serious work, there should be a full attention. And the food must be digested in the stomach also, I mean there should be attention for the food. Otherwise, the blood has to go to the stomach, and it goes to the brain. And also for food, there should be no discussion. You should do it in thoughtless awareness I think, or in a very happy mood. So, there is no liver problem this is what I am telling you about liver. [Shri Mataji is laughing].

Marie: He says the history of France has actually three bases. One is the bed,Shri Mataji: Bed?Marie: Yes. Second is the table and third is the attorney's office.Shri Mataji: Attorney's office.Marie: Money, land property. And if you- that's the way to understand French history. These are the threeShri Mataji: Problems.Marie: Pivots actually, where all the history is revolving around it.Sahaja Yogi: It's very true.Marie: And we are still a very archaic Society in that sense, because it's still very much like this.Shri Mataji: Oh, yes, but, you see, of course the solution to this also is not to be a pendulum movement that aims to all these things. You must give up this. You see, to change from one pivotal thing to another pivotal thing, it would be pendulous. Like from this to go to Communism. That is the reaction. That is rebellion, we can call it. But revolution, you see, revolution means, a movement spirally to revolve higher, to rise higher.

Shri Mataji [to a Sahaja Yogini]: Thank you, where did you get it?Sahaja Yogini: In Basel [Switzerland}, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: Ah, Basel, you remember. Thank you. Beautiful flower [inaudible].What happened to the flowers of Sahaja Yoga in Basel? We had some people in Basel.Sahaja Yogi: Not in Basel, we didn’t have a program in Basel.Shri Mataji: We had.Sahaja Yogi: Two years ago.Shri Mataji: Yes.Sahaja Yogi: They just vanished in the thin air.Shri Mataji: [Shri Mataji is laughing]. In all the air, all the flowers.Sahaja Yogi: Nobody stayed.Shri Mataji: But these flowers show that I was there. The fragrance, you see the fragrance of the white flowers, you can make it out that the fragrance that they have means that I was there, just see. That’s the proof. Even [if] people have vanished, the flowers are there.

Sahaja Yogi: Have you seen, Shri Mataji, it’s beautiful the article.Shri Mataji: Can you imagine? Yes.Yes, yes, I saw that.Sahaja Yogi: It's a beautiful thing, you see Mother.Shri Mataji: Beautiful, nice photograph.All right? See, this is the proof that I’ve been to Basel, because the white flowers don't give you fragrance also.

Shri Mataji: In London, daisies were never fragrant. Nowadays there is so much fragrance in daisies, you can’t imagine.
