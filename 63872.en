Conversation with Sahaja Yogis, Mulhouse, France, 1er September 1983

Like the Father created the world, the Son showed how to resurrect, but the Mother then nourishes, actually, and makes you something, the owner of the whole thing. So, first the God almighty, the father, then the Spirit in the heart, and then now, the Kundalini.So, after you become one with the Spirit, you become the Spirit. And the powers that the Spirit had before start manifesting in you. So, this is at this consciousness, that we have to rise. The problem is we move in a pendulum, from this to that, like from one extreme to another extreme. But the movement of consciousness is spiral, it moves in a spiral, like the Kundalini. And so, the Mother who is loving, very gently, very kindly, affectionately, manifests her beauty of nourishment.This kind of unconsciousness I want to work out, because we are a computer in that, say, a server DD, a computer. And another computer, the one we are producing, actually, is our reflection.Sahaja Yogi: Would you say it again Mother.Shri Mataji: You see, we are producing computers outside. They are the reflection of ourselves outside.Sahaja Yogi: They are the reflection of us as we are the reflection of God.Shri Mataji: So, whatever we reflect is artificial, man-made. And I was reading an article today, and the gentleman said that thousands and thousands of computer we may use, we cannot reach the computer that is our own innate intelligence.

[Conversation with Sahaja Yogis about the translation in French) [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Now, you were doing all right. But just to create a bit of humour. Tell them that, “Mother said that we were too serious, it is just to create a bit of humour”.Sahaja Yogi (about the translator): You become like a computer. [Laughter].Shri Mataji: So, what said, he said, “When you are seeing something, you don’t think about it. You just see the ego if it is there. You don’t think about it.So, you have to go to that sate where you don’t think, you just see it. That’s what he would like to say. But he said, “Tis cannot be done. Because the computer that human beings have produced is the result of that thinking”. I can say the same thing as my own words.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, absolutely.

So, the whole thing is that we have to recognize that within us lies that power. But to raise our consciousness also, even to raise our consciousness, it can be only done through the grace of God, because human beings cannot do it. And once somebody gets that grace, you can do it. But the grace is the quality of the Mother. Because people are worried all over the world about the consciousness.But here in Mulhouse, I may not make it subtler, but I’ll tell them that these powers are available within you. Because I don’ want to churn their brains, like Mulhouse, you see, churns the brain [The name of the city of Mulhouse means the house of the mill]. But I must tell you, the intellectuals and the stupid ego-oriented people, really churn my brain sometimes, it might break! [Laughter]. They want to go like this, like that, like that, you see. God know what their movement is. The best of it is that we are bracketed with sects, so when we are absolutely against them.

On three days in Geneva, people from various sects came to oppose me and shouted at me. Because they found it dangerous, because I speak against them. But they never speak against themselves, against each other. They are all big friends. Christ has said, “The Satan won’t speak against his own house”.Sahaja Yogi: But still, they put us together with these people.Shri Mataji: But there also, I speak about [interruption], I tell about the sects, the horrible things against them. So that, next time, you can show this to your television people. They won’t have any objections. And they’ll like me.Sahaja Yogi: When Mother rather speak openly against the sects-Shri Mataji: Openly.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, just imagine, in the local papers, you are put alongside a class of school children who are learning martial art and judo. Girls, not boys, girls.Shri Mataji: Is it an offspring of Zen?Sahaja Yogi: In a way, yes. It can be put to positive purposes, but unfortunately, they don’t emphasise the philosophy, they emphasise the physical part and the violence. It’s a means of self-defence and it’s taught as self-defence, in a very aggressive way.

Shri Mataji: Very good, this food was. She has never given me these sandwiches and I said, “No, I’ must have my last lunch in Mulhouse. I must have”.

This is German, German thing [porcelain]? But Germany is so close.Sahaja Yogis: No, no, no. [In French: it might be from Limoges]Shri Mataji: It must be German, the style is. It’s so close, Germany, yes? We went to Freiburg and Basel last time.Sahaja Yogini: From Germany, from Bavaria.Sahaja Yogis: Bavaria.Shri Mataji: It’s Germany.Marie: Yes.Shri Mataji: Bavaria is North Germany?Marie: South. So, München, it’s the south really.Shri Mataji: South.Marie: Yes. It’s closer to Austria.Shri Mataji: Austria, in between.Marie: It’s North of Austria. Same style of mountains, near Hungary.Shri Mataji: In Austria, there is one big hill, or we can say, in Vienna, there’s a very big mountainous area. And this is the area which is in between Germany and Austin.Sahaja Yogi: Is it the Tyrol, Mother? the Austrian Tyrol?Shri Mataji: And this place was used by the Germans. Then they occupied Austria.Sahaja Yogi: It’s the Tyrol.Shri Mataji: Yes. And there now, you see, I think some Germans must have died, or whatever it is, a funny type of a fly is there. In that thing, that no one wants to go inside the forest because if the fly bites you, you can be faintedSahaja Yogi: My God.

Shri Mataji: [Marathi].It’s a German fly, I think.[Marathi conversation]. There must be some dead spirit or something, I don’t know. A horrible fly is there. So, nobody goes inside the forest. Must be some devils, I’m sure.

Sahaja Yogini: All the devils come from this 15th century.Shri Mataji: Turkish invasion.Yes, I saw that. Turkish influence is quite a lot in architecture.Sahaja Yogini: And the little bread that we ate in the morning, you see, that we call ‘croissant’,Maire: The ‘croissant’ shape one.Shri Mataji: Yes. Croissant, comes from them.Ah!Marie: They were made to celebrate the victory over the Turks.Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Croissant, we eat it.Marie: So, when the Muslims leave then you eat their symbol. Put it in your coffee and eat it Shri Mataji: Must be. Because the Turkish influence is too much in the architecture. I was surprised.

[Conversation in French.]Shri Mataji: And Turkey itself now is in a big mess, Turkey.Very poor.

Shri Mataji: Kemal Pasha was a good man.[Foreign language conversation]Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?Translator: He was asking if Atatürk was also a good man.Shri Mataji: Who?Translator: Atatürk.Shri Mataji: Atatürk. Imagine, so he was also a Realized soul Kemal Pasha, Atatürk.

Shri Mataji: You see, but Realized souls have no place in religious activity. No one accepted them.Sahaja Yogi: They couldn't get a place, because nobody would have accepted them.Shri Mataji: I was telling them that Mc Enroe is a Realized soul. Borg is. Two styles. But both are. And Mc Enroe is a person, always in [unclear], he tells himself, "John, behave yourself ". He always talks in a third person. But he can’t bear the that people trying to insult him. Because, you see, it's too much for a Realized soul to bear insult from a person who is not even a Spirit.So, this time, I told them that I heard, I read in the paper, that he's a- somebody tried to say something to him sarcastically many a time. So, he threw some sawdust and he was asked to leave the court. And he was given punishment for that and he cannot pray now for some time. But it's very sad.Because how many people he entertains, makes them happy, joyous? And one horrible mosquito-like fellow comes from there and tries, tries to disturb the play, disturb the thing and you can't say anything to him because –Because under the democratic law, you must treat everyone equally and tolerate everybody's nonsense equally.Look, I was speaking yesterday I have not even finished my speech, and one man got up and he started speaking so loudly, insulting me. And he went out and there were people trying to sympathize with him that he must have his saying. Now who is he? I mean, I've not yet finished my lecture.[Hindi conversation]

So, this is like Mc Enroe, I feel. [Laughter]I'm sorry for him, really. My granddaughter always supports him, the little one. So, her mother said, "Why do you always support Mc Enroe?" She said, "Because he's a Realized soul!"

And the elder one is really, very subtle. Aratna, very intelligent and subtle. So, she told me that, "You know why both has retired?" So, I said, "I don't know". "It's very simple because he's a Realized soul, Mc Enroe is a Realized soul. So both does not want to go into competition with another Realized soul".It’s very- children understand truth so well, for they are not complicated.
