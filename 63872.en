Conversation with Sahaja Yogis, Mulhouse, France, 1er September 1983

Like the Father created the world, the Son showed how to resurrect, but the Mother then nourishes, actually, and makes you something, the owner of the whole thing. So, first the God almighty, the father, then the Spirit in the heart, and then now, the Kundalini.So, after you become one with the Spirit, you become the Spirit. And the powers that the Spirit had before start manifesting in you. So, this is at this consciousness, that we have to rise. The problem is we move in a pendulum, from this to that, like from one extreme to another extreme. But the movement of consciousness is spiral, it moves in a spiral, like the Kundalini. And so, the Mother who is loving, very gently, very kindly, affectionately, manifests her beauty of nourishment.This kind of unconsciousness I want to work out, because we are a computer in that, say, a server DD, a computer. And another computer, the one we are producing, actually, is our reflection.Sahaja Yogi: Would you say it again Mother.Shri Mataji: You see, we are producing computers outside. They are the reflection of ourselves outside.Sahaja Yogi: They are the reflection of us as we are the reflection of God.Shri Mataji: So, whatever we reflect is artificial, man-made. And I was reading an article today, and the gentleman said that thousands and thousands of computer we may use, we cannot reach the computer that is our own innate intelligence.

[Conversation with Sahaja Yogis about the translation in French) [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Now, you were doing all right. But just to create a bit of humour. Tell them that, “Mother said that we were too serious, it is just to create a bit of humour”.Sahaja Yogi (about the translator): You become like a computer. [Laughter].Shri Mataji: So, what said, he said, “When you are seeing something, you don’t think about it. You just see the ego if it is there. You don’t think about it.So, you have to go to that sate where you don’t think, you just see it. That’s what he would like to say. But he said, “Tis cannot be done. Because the computer that human beings have produced is the result of that thinking”. I can say the same thing as my own words.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, absolutely.

So, the whole thing is that we have to recognize that within us lies that power. But to raise our consciousness also, even to raise our consciousness, it can be only done through the grace of God, because human beings cannot do it. And once somebody gets that grace, you can do it. But the grace is the quality of the Mother. Because people are worried all over the world about the consciousness.But here in Mulhouse, I may not make it subtler, but I’ll tell them that these powers are available within you. Because I don’ want to churn their brains, like Mulhouse, you see, churns the brain [The name of the city of Mulhouse means the house of the mill]. But I must tell you, the intellectuals and the stupid ego-oriented people, really churn my brain sometimes, it might break! [Laughter]. They want to go like this, like that, like that, you see. God know what their movement is. The best of it is that we are branded with sects, so when we are absolutely against them.

On three days in Geneva, people from various sects came to oppose me and shouted at me. Because they found it dangerous, because I speak against them. But they never speak against themselves, against each other. They are all big friends. Christ has said, “The Satan won’t speak against his own house”.Sahaja Yogi: But still, they’ll stick together with these people.Shri Mataji: But there also, I speak about [interruption], I tell about the sects, the horrible things against them. So that, next time, you can show this to your television people. They won’t have any objections. And they’ll like me.Sahaja Yogi: When Mother rather openly against the sects-Shri Mataji: Openly.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, just imagine, in the local papers, you are put alongside as class of school children who are learning martial art and judo. Girls, not boys, girls.Shri Mataji: Is it an offspring of Zen?Sahaja Yogi: In a way, yes. It can be put to positive purposes, but unfortunately, they don’t emphasise the philosophy, they emphasise the physical part and the violence. It’s a mixt of self-defence and it’s total self-defence, in a very aggressive way.

Shri Mataji: Very good, this food was. She has never given me these sandwiches and I said, “No, I’ must have my last lunch in Mulhouse. I must have”.
