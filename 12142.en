Seminar, day 2, Paris, (France), June 21th, 1981, how to use the Grace

PART 1

Shri Mataji: ...Yes, I hope today [we'll] have something practical about love.

Marie [in French]: Today, Mother would like to speak about something very practical about love.

Shri Mataji: That we should understand when something happens to us what should we do about it. Say, if you are, this time you were tired, you feel tired then what is happening?

We have on the right-hand side the "prana vayu", it's the prana, it's the right-hand side, the major prana. So, the right side energy is exhausted too much. And when it gets exhausted it freezes the heart, you see. I mean, we do the more work through the right, so the left is frozen. So, we should put our hand on our heart, right hand, or put the left to the right when we are tired. 

Another way could be to put your left hand on your head, left side, and put right hand towards the photograph. Another very good idea is to get vibrations on the right-hand side if you are very tired or depressed, I should say when depressed. When you feel depressed, then you feel the heaviness here [Back Agnya] also. If it is too much on the back, then you put your right hand and the left hand towards the photograph.

But mostly, you see, this energy of mana is Manashakti on the left-hand side. And then, because of the exhaustion of that Shakti, you feel very, very tired. So then, that means ultimately you'll find out that it is too much exhausted here, due to too much use of the left side. So our right is to be, right is to be raised.

So, the first one is a physical exhaustion. And second one is an exhaustion of your mental, emotional [inaudible]

I don't know what is in their mind, what they mean if it's superego. If it's superego, that is mind, I mean. In Sanskrit language, it is called as Manashakti, "mana", "manasa". 

So, now, these two different things have to be understood that if you have, say, a depression on the right-hand side because of physical exhaustion, then you should try to take vibrations from the left. And when there is a mental exhaustion in the sense that you feel depressed and all that, then put right towards the photograph and the left hand on the head. You might feel also heaviness, you might feel also heaviness on the head, on the left part. 

So now, you realize that when there is a depression due to over-mental activity, brain activity, actually your heart get exhausted - not exhausted but frozen. But on the contrary, you see, when your heart is exhausted, I mean when you mentally or - what you call – emotionally you are exhausted, then your brainless start, the [inaudible] we can say, the brain is frozen. So, it is just the other way round, you have to do it.

Supposing you are physically exhausted, then you should listen to some nice poetry or some music or something romantic or something, say, solacing or peaceful sort of things. But if you are more exhausted because of your too much mental activity or too much of emotional activity, then you should listen to war programs or some things, [Laughter] some things of great excitement [inaudible]. Excitement [Laughter]

But, you see, nothing should be led too far otherwise one moment you'll be listening to [??] music, to something melodious, you see, so you'll be this way, that way. Once you have recovered, then you just settle down in the center. This is for balancing. 

Now we must understand how to take the Grace upon ourselves. It's just the other way round.

Now, supposing you have the problem of exhaustion of right side and the heart is catching and you are taking vibrations from the photograph, then you put your left hand. So when you have to take the Grace, you have to take it from the right side and put it on the left-hand side, like this.

Now if you are exhausted, physically you feel exhausted then this is the other way round one has to go, I mean, I'm sorry. If you are feeling exhausted on the left-hand side, if you have exhausted your energy on the left hand-side, then you fill it up like this [with the right hand], all right?

So for raising your Kundalini and it's to be done on the point like supposing you have exhausted yourself physically, all right? Take it.

Now, you put your hand on the heart, all right? And the giving of bandhan has to be at this time because the Grace has to come here, it has to be the other way round.

See, we take the Grace like this. Now, say, if you have to take the Grace with it like that. I'm sorry- the Grace has to come to us on the right-hand side because if right side is exhausted, so what we do is to rise right side to take left. I'll give an example, one simple example. [Inaudible]

Now, this one [the white candle] is the -say- the sun or we can say the right side. And this [the red candle] is the left side, all right? All right. Now, this one [the red candle] is burning too much. This one is burning too much is exhausted, all right? And this one [the white candle] is dead. This one is dead, all right? So we have to enlightened this one. All right, and this is to be put down a little bit.

This is to be put down and this is to be enlightened. All right, do you follow this point?

Sahaja Yogis: Hum [means yes].

This one is enlightenment and this is to be put down or to be given more of energy because it is exhausted. All right? So to give the energy, what we'll do is to bring the energy from the Grace on this side. All right? And to enlighten this we do this.

Sahaja Yogi [to Marie]: Non, non, non avec la main droite, tu remontes [No, no, no with the right hand, you go up.]

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, we raise it like that. I mean we raise the side which is not yet enlightened which is frozen. Did you follow now?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, absolutely. We check the right side and we pull it up, take the Grace and put it down to the left side.

Shri Mataji: Grace, you put down because Grace cools it down, gives it more energy.

Did you follow that point? We'll be practising it, now, all of you. [To Marie] And you tell them now.

Reduce the recording...

[Cut in the audio]

And Kundalini is also reflecting Grace. So, whatever is present in the atmosphere is the absolute Grace, all right? Son whichever is sleeping is to be awakened means the one which you have not exhausted, the one which is frozen. Did you follow that?

Sahaja Yogis: Hum [means yes].

Shri Mataji: Marie can feel it?

Marie: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Ah! Thomas has asked Me. Gavin, did you follow? What is the conclusion?

Gavin: So, when it is- you want to raise the left, the right, then you do the opposite and you bring down-

Sahaja Yogi: No.

Gavin: Hello?

[Laughter].

Shri Mataji: I'll tell you. When, when it is to be awakened, you see, then you raise it, correct. Awaken is correct, whenever you have to awaken, you have to raise. But when to have to fill it, when you have to fill into it you see, then you have to [put down the Grace on you]. So the reflected Grace is used for raising the Kundalini. And the real Grace is used for filling.

Gavin: When do we awaken and when do we fill in?

Shri Mataji: Now, the one we have exhausted very much,

Gavin: Yes.

Shri Mataji: We fill it.

Gavin: OK.

Shri Mataji: And the one which are not used, we awaken.

Gavin: So, it's a matter of how far we awaken left side and we fill it in into right side. OK, now we want to- right side, you awaken right side and you fill it into the left side. 

Shri Mataji: All right?

Gavin: All right, OK now.

Shri Mataji: Now, say, if you have to much ego what will you do?

[Laughter].

Because ego, you see, has crossed over so how you are doing is to put this thing left like this and the right side. Actually, ego comes up because of the exhaustion of your right side. All right? So to bring it down, you raise your left side, push up the left side and bring it down.

Like you can say when we exhaust our right side and work for many – say we plan, we think, or we create something or we go into action of any kind physical or mental, means the brains, you see. Or we live in our future, spoiling our liver, then what happens is our right side is exhausted and the left side is very weak, is frozen. Also heart gets frozen because ego is created as a by-product. Ego is a by-product of our over-activity of the sun line or the Prana-Brahma Shakti. Then what we have to do is to bring it down. So, what we do is to bring the Grace upon ourselves and bring it down, the Grace with this. Do you follow that?

Gavin: Mother, do we do it this way to put the balloon of the ego? On the left side, this way: down, this way, right?

Shri Mataji: Ah.

Gavin: Like that.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no.

Gavin: Because the ego balloon is covering this way.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

Gavin: So we bring it down this way, on the right side.

Shri Mataji: What you have to do is only the brain. There is nothing to be brought down because ego is not going to come up to your waist, you see. The brain stays here. Maybe, you see, in don't know in modern times where it's going to be.

[Laughter].

Now, these days, people are so particular about their waist size maybe?

[Shri Mataji is laughing.] So anything is possible with you, one day you can have a nose starting coming out of your laps, this time I won't be surprised.

And the nose, you see, everything is possible with human beings. They are trying hard to have a new evolutionary style.

Because there are some who want to believe that there must be some other way around. For human beings, they cannot think of one way. Because there will be no choice left to [inaudible]. But you are made like this that you have to eat from here [the mouth], there is no choice, whatever it is. [Laughter]

And if you try to choose things then, you see, then it happens that the food has to go through the nose. [Laughter]

Making choices also, you see, gives you such a waste of time. But this is ego trick, right-hand side. For example, only one advantage is there that if you use your right side properly, put your heart in it, then you create variety to create beauty. But you create, not choose, you see, there's a difference. If you start choosing, then your ego will develop. But if you create, then beauty will develop. 

But they take about half an hour on a table to decide what they will eat. Instead of that, they should decide what they will not eat. That's simple. Means you have a wider choice, you can eat whatever is there. But the important things are what you don't do. But if you say that: "I like". Say, if I'm sitting down and I say: "I like Buckingham Palace". Then, do I get
it? If I say that: “I don't like Buckingham Palace” then the rest
is available. [Laughter] You can have whatever you like. [Inaudible]
human beings, they have a brain of their own type. Animals are like
that. Supposing they have some trouble, then they will not eat
something that is not to be eaten by instinct and they will eat all
that they can eat. But not that on the table you decide half an hour
what you will have, whether you'll have some salmon
fish or a trout
fish or this fish or the tail of the fish or the eye of the fish. 

Or they'll have an ox, which part of the tail? Horrible, such a waste of time. They sit together, enjoy each other to enjoy the food. And that's how the enjoyment is in minimum. For Sahaja Yogis, they should develop an attitude towards anything: “I like this, I like this, I like this.” All the time the same. Not go saying: “I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it.” Ultimately, they will like something which they cannot have. Like, you see, we had somebody French in India. So, he looked at Indian art, he said: “I don't like it, it is too much, it is naive.” I said: “How can you certify?” According to French, maybe it is naive, but maybe according to the whole world, the French are naive. So, how can you say it? It is- try to appreciate. He said: “We like art which is very little here and there.” I said: “Supposing, God had made you with very few hairs here and there, would that look nice?” The head, you need a lot of hair, on the eyelids you need less, here you will need another kind. How can you condemn anyone like that? If you have a large heart you appreciate everything. 

That's how you minimize the objects of joys. Every art gives a different type of joy. There must be a thousand types of joys according to Indians' standards, thousand names. There names, names. There are names. For example, the joy you get when you break your Sahasrara is called as "nirananda". You know, my name is Nira. I'm called by name "nira" [water] in my home, it's a short form of Nirmala. It means Maria also. 

[Some big noise] [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Next time I come, I try this. [Laughter]

Marie: It sounds like a sports car.

Shri Mataji: Is it? I don't know but [inaudible] it could be something better. [Laughter] It is French style. [Inaudible]

It has to be appealing to your vibrations that the point, appealing to your Spirit. That's only possible after Realization that you can have absolute joys. Before that it is so in the head. It has not absolute value. So, why waste time? All right? Let's have food.
