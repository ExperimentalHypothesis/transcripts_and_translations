For example, we work very hard, think too hard, you are right sided; to compensate for it, we take , say, slipping pills or may be drinks, or something like that, just to compensate. We can’t bear it, too much on the right. But that doesn’t give you help, because you swing from one end to another. So, in the center you have to move, and for that, there is a special mechanism within us. As I told you yesterday, you have to have a very scientific outlook, is to keep your mind open. If it works out, you have to accept as honest people. We say we are skeptical. All right, but we can keep ourselves open about it, that, after all, we have not reached the absolute truth. So, if you have to reach that truth, what should happen to us? Maybe this is more known to the people in India, maybe, because of their discoveries in the inner world. But has to be known, even in the West, because, as I told you yesterday, that the tree which has grown so big, has to know his roots. Otherwise there is always a problem, which you don’t know how to face. So, as I have been told you about the roots, now, about the left side and the right side, the two sympathetic nervous system, the left and the right, both of them act separately, which I think doctors do not know about. About diabetes, now - it's too much talking on Me, imbalance - about diabetes somebody asked Me today, how does he get diabetes by thinking. In India, if you go to a village, they’ll ask you to take some tea and you just can’t take it, because the sugar is so much, that the spoon has to stand at right angle. And none of them get diabetes, none of them. But our bureaucrats in India, all of them get it. Also the politicians. The reason is, they think too much, they plan too much. They are very right sided. Now, which center does the right side work, is the second center, which we call as Swadishthan. This second center, which is the Swadishthan, is, as you can see very clearly, provides for right side activity. It is connected, upward passes through the optic chiasma, goes to the left side, creating our ego. Like you build this big hall, so believe that you have done a great job. But actually, something that was dead, that we have put together, that`s how hall is build. From dead to dead. We have done no living work so far. But that creates an imaginary feeling that we have done this, we have done that. And that's how this balloon of ego starts growing within us, on one side. Now, when this Swadishthan is working, it has got a very important work to do, is to replace the brain’s cells in our head, which we are using for thinking, the grey cells. It has to do that. And because of this pressure of a thinker on that center, it neglects the other functions, that it has to do: of looking after your liver, your pancreas, your spleen and your kidneys and partly your digestive system. As a result, all this organs go into problems. One of them is the pancreas, which causes, what we call, diabetes. Liver goes out of order. When liver goes out of order, then the heat rises in your body. From liver it rises higher, goes upward and catches on to the right heart center, as we call it, which gives you a disease called asthma. Asthma can be easily cured, if you can look after your over active liver. It becomes over active, because it has very limited energy, and it has to do its job, of expelling poison from your body into the blood stream. But it has no energy to do that, so it becomes over active. And such a person, cannot also, release all the heat of the body into the bloodstream, so the heat starts passing over. So much so, that it can reach heart, and the person can get a massive heart attack. In the young age, supposing some people, who are playing tennis and smoking - I mean all out to destroy them self in a way, I should say - or some very strenuous games with that smoking and drinking and pressurizing themselves, get a very fatal heart attack, a massive heart attack. Because they have gone in a complete out of balance situation. Now, at the same time, the most dangerous thing that can happen to us, because of this center, is that we get a horrible disease called blood cancer. Blood cancer comes to us because of the spleen getting out of order or imbalanced. The spleen is a speedometer in us, or we can say it`s a, it`s a rhythm keeper; it keeps our rhythm of life. But we are all the time out of rhythm. You sleep at any time, get up at any time and any kind of emergency that comes in, this organ has to supply, red blood corpuscles, RBCs , for the emergency, any emergency rises. For example you are eating your food; and then suddenly you have to run, then what happens, that you get pain here in the stomach, this side. Because your spleen has started producing RBCs quickly. But we are all the time in tensions. All the time, you are very hectic. We get up in the morning, first thing we do horrible thing is to read newspapers. In the newspaper they never give good news, always has to be something sensational, challenging your spleen. Then the... Then the spleen, poor thing, starts excreting or creating more RBCs (red blood cells). And when that happens, the person who is doing all these things, does not realize that already he has tortured this pour spleen. Again he goes into another hectic life, for example he may just jump into his car, he has to go to his office, then he sees the jam and then he is very upset because he gets late in the office, then the boss shouts at him, something like that. All the time there is an emergency, a time bound life. And all the time people are running up and down in a very hectic manner. And this hectic manner makes this pour spleen really crazy. Doesn’t understand, what's the matter with this gentleman, why is he behaving like this? Then the vulnerability is established. And anything that happens from the left side, is just triggers the cancer. I’ll show you how it works out. This is one center say from the left side and the right side, both of them combine to form the real center. Now, If you are working too hard on the right side, like that, it starts moving, taking the energy, exhausting the energy, it is like this. And anything happens to the left, it just goes out. Now, it's broken, in the sense the relationship with the whole is lost. So, it gets on its own! It starts working on its own, we call it a malignant cell. Means it starts growing, in such a way, that there is no relationship with other cells. Or if the nose starts rising, growing, then this place all gets covered, this place all gets covered, your ear can get covered, and the rest of the cells are still growing at the same rate. This malignancy is because of imbalance in us. Even ordinary cancer is cause by that. So, what have we to do? How are we to overcome these things? Of course, there are doctors and things. Most of them are looking after most of the people. But those who are seeking the truth can be cured by themselves, because their Kundalini will rise. When it rises, it nourishes that center, it brings back the broken like this, nourishes them, she integrates all the centers, so your thinking, your heart, your stomach, your liver, all integrated. You do not repent for anything. You get an integrated personality, you get a very

healthy personality. And such a person automatically looks very healthy and very peaceful. Because the centers that are within us, which are enlightened, are the centers which are responsible for different functions in our body. So the first one I have told you about, the second one, and the first one I told you about yesterday, and the next one to that, is the center which is very important, is called as a navel center, Nabhi chakra. This is the one which looks after the solar plexus within us. So, physically we understand this, but spiritually this is a very important center. Because physically of course, you know the problem of the solar plexuses, but there is another big problem we have, and that is surrounding it, is the area, which we call in Sahaja Yoga as “Void”, which is to be crossed. Like, Moses had to make a bridge , sort of a thing it is. You have to make a bridge. And this bridging comes when this part gets enlighten. Now, this part is made of ten valences within us. Human beings have got ten valences. These ten valences are like Ten Commandments, we can say. But they are within us, not without. Once they are enlightened, than we rise in our own valences, means we rise in our nature, as a human being. So, we become very righteous people. Like all saints are righteous, they don’t do anything wrong, they don’t cheat, they don’t tell lies, they don’t take money, they don’t grab you, they don’t torture you, they are very loving, dynamic, fearless people. All these qualities, suddenly, manifest in a personality, which receives their Self-Realization. Thus we create a society of wonderful people. Then we come to another center, which we call as the center of the Mother or Mana, but actually is the Heart center. Heart center in Sahaja Yoga we have three sides, one is the left, is the heart, right heart and the central heart. Now, this is the center under the sternum bone, and all the antibodies are created in the sternum bone, till you are twelve years of age. And then they go to various areas in the body, and wait for a signal. This is a remote signal, which comes from the sternum, sternum bone. Now, those people who suffer from insecurities, especially women, if they suffer from some insecurities, from their husbands, or if their motherhood is challenged, then they develop a very horrible cancer of the breast. If they are insecure from their husbands, who are not loyal to them, or some sort of a problem is there, then the women may develop this breast cancer, because of this center, being absolutely dislocated, due to insecurities, Whenever we see anything facing us which is dangerous, immediately our sternum bone starts vibrating. Those vibrations are remotely caught by the antibodies, and they get ready to fight the diseases. But when the connection is lost and the cells become malignant, antibodies also get tired fighting it. So when the Kundalini is passing through this, this center gets again nourished, and one can achieve a great sense of security within himself, very great sense of security. He feels absolutely secure. Then the same Kundalini rises, up to the center we call as Vishuddhi. This center is the one, which looks after sixteen things. You can say ear, nose, tongue, teeth, everything. They are sixteen things it looks; it has got sixteen petals. Face, eyes, everything it looks after. But it can also go out of order, when we go into imbalances about it. As a result, a person loses many things. But when, you are nourished by it by the Kundalini, then what happens? That you just become a witness. You, somehow or other, get out of the crazy world and you start seeing the whole thing like a drama. Like, you are seeing some drama, supposing, and then you see Napoleon. Then you think you are also Napoleon, and you start really going with him. But when the drama is over, then suddenly you realize, “Oh, I am not Napoleon, I am something else!” In the same way, when we are involved in this mad world, then we are upset. Say, we are standing in the water, we are afraid of getting drowned. The water rises, falls down again, there is another wave comes and goes down. But supposing, somehow, you get onto a boat, then you can watch that water, and if you become an expert swimmer, you can jump in and save others also. The same thing happens, that you just start seeing the whole thing like a drama. Your problem you see as a drama. Now, because you are not in that problem, you can solve your problem, very easily. It’s very simple to solve that problem, because you are not in it. If you are involve in it you are going into a turmoil. But if you are out of it, you know what is the solution and it can be solved very easily. Now, the center that we call as the Agnya chakra, which is placed between the optic chiasma, is very important. On one side, it looks after the pituitary and the other side it looks after the pineal body. Now the pituitary is responsible for controlling this Mr. Ego, and on the other side we have got superego which is created by our conditionings. We have so many conditionings. We have conditionings of the country where we are born in, we have conditionings in the family we are born in, our parents and then we have conditionings with the religion we are born in, and all kind of conditionings we have. All these conditionings make the another balloon, and both of them form a crest on our head that’s how our fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone become a hard bone. But when the Kundalini rises and passes through this center, it sucks in. That's how our karmas, so called, whatever action or wrong things we have done or the wrong conditionings we have, everything gets sucked in and it opens like a petal. The limbic area, that is between, opens and the Kundalini passes through, pierces through your fontanel bone area and you start feeling the cool breeze out of your head. You are surprised how it happened. And then you can feel it all around you is cool breeze . which is the All Pervading Power. As a result that you become one with this, all the time the energy is flowing through you and though you may going into imbalances a little bit, but you come to balance in no time. This is as far as the physical side is concerned. Mentally you feel perfectly all right, but above all, you develop a new dimension in your awareness, which we call as “collective consciousness”. Collective consciousness about which, Jung has said lots of things. Collective consciousness is where you can feel the centers of others on your fingertips and also you can feel your own centers. And if you know to correct yours and then of others, you can easily manage the whole thing. So this collective consciousness is the one, is the new awareness, a new dimension, which one has to achieve. This is the new birth, or we should say, the second birth, as we call it. In Sanskrit language is called as, a person who is a realized soul, is called a “dwijaha”, means born twice. And a bird is also called dwijaha, because first is an egg and then it is born as a bird, a free bird. In the same way, a person who is a realized soul has a second birth. As they say, ”You are to be born again”, it happens. But it is actualization, it is not just a certificate. Anybody can take a certificate, ”I am this, I am that”, that makes no difference. Because you must have the powers, of what you are. If you are a human being, you have, you have human powers. In the same way, if you become a realized soul, super human being, than you must have the powers of a super human being. If you don’t have these powers, it is no use giving a false certificate like that. Same as I told you about religion, when somebody asked Me the question, that why are they fight in the name of religion? Because it's man-made. Saints never fight. They never fight. They love and they understand each other and they know the Absolute. So, when your Spirit, which is in your heart, has the seat here and it gets connected with your attention, then the light of the Spirit makes you an enlightened person, and in that light, you know what is right and what is wrong. What is good for you, what is constructive and what is destructive. The power of Spirit is, that of course it's a collective being within us, no doubt, also we say that we are part and a parcel of the whole. But we are not. Once you become collectively conscious, then you are only part and parcel of the whole. Then you become the source of joy. Spirit is the source of joy. You become joyous, you are full of joy. Joy s not double-faced, it's not like happiness - unhappiness. It's a permanent state of enjoyment. And, you know the absolute truth. On your fingertips you can know. Even in the Koran, as I told you, in the Koran it is said that, “Your hands will speak at the time of your Resurrection, and they will give witness against you”. So, this is the time of your Judgment, Last Judgment, when your Kundalini is going to tell you, where you stand. And once you correct yourself, you enter into the Kingdom of God. This has to happen. It's nothing artificial about it, is all living process of a living energy, which works and you cannot pay for it. You cannot pay for it. This is the only snag, if there is anything. So may God bless you all. Yesterday we spent lot of time asking questions and answering, I don’t mind a little bit of that, but not too much... Yesterday we had too many questions and answers. So, if you could ask Me some questions, is all right. But should be relevant. Because you know, I’m not here to get anything out of you, is just to tell you what you have, to give you what is yours. It all happens because of your energy. I have nothing to do with it in a way. Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten another light.

Q: Could you tell something about the nadis?

Shri Mataji: Nadis... You didn’t tell them? He told Me he has already talked to you! The left one is known as the Ida Nadi, which get us to the left side. The right one as the Pingala Nadi, which gets us to the right side. The central one is known as the Sushumna Nadi. Also, there are a many other details about it, which once you come to Sahaja Yoga, you will know a lot of. It's too much really, because I must have given at least three thousand to four thousands lectures, in English language itself, and they are all on the tape, you can always listen to them. Knowledge is like a vast ocean, and the source of knowledge is your Spirit. So, once you are realized, you will be able to understand everything.

Q: What happens when a huge amount of energy comes out of here and manifests himself in forms of pictures? Is, is a, that means this center is broken. Is not all right. You shouldn’t see anything. You shouldn’t see the light. You have to be the light. If I see the light, then I’m not the light! All right? Q:How much influence does food have on the collective consciousness?

Shri Mataji: - What has... ?

P: - Food. Food... You see, is food, food we deal with in such a manner, that whatever is deficient in a person, whatever is complementary in a person, should be eaten. Like, you have to, supposing, you people are very right sided then you must take to carbohydrates; but if you are left sided, then you have to take to proteins. But very big animals than human beings are not to be eaten, because their muscles are very big, and they cause troubles to your teeth and things like that. But food becomes the secondary thing, after you have had the ambrosia of Realization. It is no so important. Just don’t bother too much about food, at all.

Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

Q: How the people balance? Individually, everybody has a different set of problems. How does each individual balance ? Bring them back to the balance.

Shri Mataji: I mean, first is, of course, individual balance, and when you are individually balanced, then when you are the Spirit, then it's a collective consciousness. In that the Spirit gives you an absolute nature. And everybody being absolute there is no problem of balancing with anyone else. You just enjoy each other. That's all. Only you are dressed up differently, you comb your hair differently. That doesn’t matter. That’s all outside. But inside you enjoy each other. There is a beautiful thing said about one poet Namadeva - yesterday i told them about that one, no? - about Namadeva, who was a tailor, just a tailor. And he went to see another realized soul, another saint, in another village, who was a potter. And the potter was needing the clay with his feet when this Namadeva went there. And he went and he stood, stand. And he said, a beautiful poem he has written, that, „I came here to see the formless", means the vibrations. "I came here to feel the vibrations, I came here to see the formless, but the whole formless is in your form!” What an appreciation, what an enjoyment and what endearment it creates. I mean, we human beings never talk like that, you see. When we talk to each other is so artificial and can be very selfish , can be very skimming and can be anything. You just don’t know. If somebody says, ”Thank you” to you, you often start thinking ”Why, what did I do?” Or somebody says something bad about you, ”You should know I've done nothing good for him, why is it saying bad about me, I don't know”, is like that, you see, is not that. It’s absolutely clear cut. Cristal clear temperament you get, absolutely. You become crystal clear and the other person is also crystal clear and they are just enjoy each other. That`s all. We have never enjoy each other. Actually we have never used the Power of Love, we have always use the power of hatred. Anything that you want to do, you have to put some sort of an issue to fight. Here there is no such question. Such a state we all should have, for the emancipation of humanity, for the emancipation of our country, all the countries, all over the world, for our children and for ourselves. - Yes Sir ?

Q: What happens to Kundalini, whether a major accident, or some injury to this area?

Shri Mataji: We have to correct it. If it's physically very much injured, it can be corrected. There is no such problem. Yes, please.

Q: Everything in creation isn't it connected, therefore couldn't there be could it be possible that free choice is actually Maya?

Shri Mataji: You have free choice to know it’s Maya. You have to reach that point. Otherwise you will never accept. You see, you are a human beings. If you are told anything you'll never accept it. So it's better to reach that point, where to feel that is all sort of illusion. And then you discover it. You have to have that much free choice. You are made that way. And such a choice is to be accepted, to be respected.

Q: Kundalini is such a strong force. Now, what happens when it doesn’t actually achieve a connection?

Shri Mataji:In Sahaja Yoga we'll see that it reaches that point. But it is a force like. In a seed there is a primule. And the primule first just sprouts then a little plant it becomes, gradually it becomes a very big tree. And out of that tree, thousands of seeds coming. So, in that little bit of that seed, there are the maps of all these creations. In the same way, that Kundalini is a force. Supposing it rises and it reaches the apex also and is not established, then we have to remember the parable of Christ, that, ”Some of the seeds fell in the marshy land and got lost”. Then again they take birth, then again they work it out. So, best is getting done, once for all. The time has come, is the blossom time, better have it done.

Q: Perhaps now would be the time.

Shri Mataji: Of course. Perhaps now it is, it is the time. Yes, please.

Q: Can any yoga balance the mind?

Shri Mataji: Cannot. Any other yoga is a part and parcel of the same. Actually, they have separated. They have taken out one part of yoga, one part of yoga there. It's a, if you see the Patanjali Yoga it is Ashtangas, means there are eight full. And basically is dealt with the ascent, with the thoughtless awareness, which are Nirvichar Samadhi, and then with the doubtless awareness, which has to be achieved, and that is only through the Kundalini awakening. Also, he has suggested some exercises that have to be done, if it is necessary. When the Kundalini rises, we know what the problem is, and we can do the exercises. And so, all the yogas are included in Sahaja Yoga. When the Kundalini rises, then it goes into Raja Yoga, in the sense that one center augments, when the Kundalini is passed through that. Supposing the Kundalini has come out of it, then it has to close, because it has to stop the Kundalini. Then it passes through another, then it has to close again. All these is called bhandan. But this is not to be done outside. It is to be done by the machinery itself which works spontaneously, automatically. Yesterday I told you, as the car starts, all the machine starts working. But without starting the car, if you start moving the wheels, what will happen?

Q: How this period that we are living in now, be viewed from the future?

Shri Mataji: Viewed from the future? Is the excellent time, the best time. And then we are not thinking of future or of past. Once we enter into that, then we just enjoy the present, which we have never enjoyed. Because future doesn’t exist. The past is over. We have to be in present. So we establish ourselves in present and enjoy every moment of it. Future is just our imagination, idea.

Q: Can one person release the energy for another?

Shri Mataji: Of course. That’s what I said. One enlighten person can enlighten another person. Q: Through the method of Shiatsu? Shiatsu. Shri Mataji: No, there is not such a thing. Only under your hand. You can move it. It moves through your hand. Just if you move like this, you can do it. As simple as that. It has to be simple. Because it is so vital.

Q: Krishnamurti doesn't believe this, he believes that the health can come to you... It has to come to you.

Shri Mataji: You see, Krishnamurti has said too many things. Talking is not the way, it is the actualization, is the becoming. That is important. So many books have been written. I tell you. Even you see the books, one goes mad the way this is written and really people are wondering, "What is what? What is what?" Who want to go? What to do? Actually, it's the actualization. It's the actualization that is important.

Q: Should I ask You, now is the time for that actualization?

Shri Mataji: Yes, of course. It's all right. There's one lady there. Yes, madam. What is she reading? What is it? I can get few words.

Q:I think I got the message now. Mother the lady is asking a question as to, she is wondering whether the awakening of Kundalini can in fact be dangerous? She's red a number of books where...

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, is correct. That I should have covered already. It is not dangerous at all. At all. You see this books are written by people who are absolutely unauthorized. Have they raised anybody's Kundalini? They have not. But, just, just a moment, sit down, sit down. You see, this job is to be done by somebody who is authorized by the Divine. Every Tom, Dick and Harry can not do it. You see, when you put, supposing a plug into the, you put your hand into the plug and say that electricity is dangerous, because you don’t know what plug is. You have to know it. If you know it, you can do it. Is not, this is all modern, is all modern I think, is more 20th century knowledge that has come up. None of the old books have written such a nonsense like that. This is just to frighten people so that they don’t gate their Realization, is the point! She is your Mother. Kundalini is your Mother, your individual Mother and She knows each and every thing about you. Not only that, but She is such a loving Mother, that She gives your rebirth, without even you knowing about it, till you really feel it. It’s so wonderful! Now, your mother, when she gave your birth, she took up all the labor pains upon herself. In the same way, now we have thousands of people who got Realization. Nobody felt anything bad except sometimes you do feel little heat, that's all. Thousands of people. But the people who have written that, is all modern style. On the contrary, there was a great saint called Ramadasa, at the time of Shivaji. He was the guru of Shivaji. Was a very well known king of Maharashtra. And somebody asked him that, “How much time takes does it take for a Kundalini to rise?” So he used a Sanskrit word means tatkshana, means that moment. But the person who has to do it has to be authorized, and the person who has to take it, must desire it! That is the word used. This is all modern nonsense that has come up to sell books. That's all I think. Or some of the people, who have no authority, those who led a very funny life. I know of someone who has written a funny book about Kundalini, who has a very bad life of his own, and he says that, "I got such a shock, I got this, that". Naturally. You had no business to enter into an area, where you are not authorized. And if so, also you should have gone to somebody who is authorized. The authority has to come from the Divine, that’s important.

Q: Who is your guru

Shri Mataji: He is asking? I am my own guru and I’ll make you your own guru. You don't have to go to any guru, anymore. You become your own guru. When the Atma, the Spirit comes into you, then you don’t need any guru. Why do you need? Of course I can give you guidance and at the most, you can call Me, The Mother. That’s all. There is no need to be subservient to anyone. There is no need to pay anyone. Of course, not, you cannot pay. Anybody who takes your money is your servant, a man has no self respect. He takes money from you for God, how can he? And we also, very foolishly, give money to such horrible people, who are just devils! They are evil geniuses. And the way they have managed this, is they have really made so many people so very sick, that sometimes, I do not know, where are they going to land up, the way they have been. How madam?

Q: Can You give us some person, can You give us somebody individually, when You say this?

Shri Mataji: Most of them are in the market. They are in the market. I need not take their names, at this auspicious time. Horrible people. Yes, madam?

Q: Is being over-emotional concerned with thinking?

Shri Mataji: More emotional...

Q: Is over-emotional, she is saying.

Shri Mataji: Yes, you see, both ways one thinks. Over-emotional people also think and those who are not emotional also think. This is no question, it acts on both the sides. The emotional people think of the past, "Oh, I was so happy, now I am so unhappy", sort of a thing, you see? And the people who are not emotional think how to make others unhappy?

Q: How does what You are talking about line up with what is written in the Bible, about salvation?

Shri Mataji: About what?

Q: Salvation. Shri Mataji: Same thing it is Madam, is the same thing. Absolutely, Bible can be only explained through Sahaja Yoga. Gita can be explained only through Sahaja Yoga. Quran can be explained only through Sahaja Yoga. You have to read between the lines. Christ was given only three, four years. What is three, four years to explain anything? People were so cruel. You know, I was in London, four years I was struggling with seven hippies. Couldn't give them Realization, it's so horrible. What could He do in four years? It’s not an easy thing to work it out.

Q: Is Kundalini the only force in this particular time, that will do this particular job?

Shri Mataji: No, all the time this was the force, all the time. It's all the time, this was the force. It’s called also, in the Bible it is said, that about the tree of life, is this mechanism. Also said that "I'll appear before you as tongues of flames" is the, the, when the Kundalini rises, then your centers look like that. So many things there are even in the Bible. In everything, in Koran it is called as Asas, the names are different, but it is so. Like Tao is the Kundalini. Tao as described, is also Kundalini. Zen system, Zen also means the same. Dhyana is the same thing. Confucious talked of the same thing, Socrates talked of the same thing. But only thing, is not said so clearly, because there were not people intelligent as you are today, to understand it, I think, that it was not said so clearly. Today we have so many seekers, can you imagine? So many seekers. The world is full of them. And they are intelligent, they have understood what is Divine, they try to understand. Is a very different category of people. As William Blake has said: “These are men of God”. They will find God and they will make others men of God.” It's very clearly he has said it hundred years back. So, that is what it is. And it is all, also in one of the Nadi Granthas, which was written by Brighu Muni, who was the originator of the horoscopes and all that, astrology. He has written very clearly that this is going to happen and this year specially is something according to the calculations, seems to be a big explosion. It's just like that.

Q: Even in somebody who is severely injured like in the spinal cord, can Kundalini be raised?

Shri Mataji: Yes can be. Can be, most of the people do get it. If somebody has to much of problems then than it maybe that, it may little bit trouble, but one can correct it. It's, you see, the generosity of Divine is such, that He tries to give it to everyone. So much, that I'm Myself amazed. It doesn't consider anything else. Just like a big whirlwind it comes, just. I am Myself surprised how people get Realization. Where, like people, in Russia I was telling you yesterday. Then I went to Bogota. They have never heard about Me, nothing of the kind, and thousands were there. They all got Realization. Very surprising. I was so surprised. It's something is there in the generosity of the Divine that it's working out. And is better that we all get drenched into that. All right. So we'll have the process of Realization. Just to remove your doubts, I talked to you and allowed you to ask Me questions and allowed lot of time for it, because you see, when you are going through that process I don’t want your mind just to come like a jack in the box, to say something. So is better to keep that mind little bit silent, I said, "All right, you can ask Me questions". But these questions, whether I answer them or not, or whether they satisfy you or not, whether you ask questions or not, makes no differences. Because this is all mental feats. It is beyond the mind, Kundalini takes you. So, what important thing is, that you must desire to get your Self-Realization. If you do not desire it, if you do not want it, I cannot force on you. This is the biggest problem. You cannot force on anyone. You have to desire it and ask for it, humbly. If you are saying, that, "No, I won't have it". So, I would request you that you better go and not disturb others. Because is something that cannot work against your free will. That’s the free choice, as you say. Is that is the free choice, that till that point, you have a free choice whether to ask for it or not. Now, there are two conditions, as I told yesterday. The first one is that, we have to forgive ourselves fully. We are not to feel guilty, at all. Absolutely, we are human beings, and human beings are the only ones who commit mistakes. Gods are not going to commit mistakes. So, if we commit mistakes, doesn’t matter. But as I told you, the generosity and the forgiveness of the Divine is so tremendous. that whatever you have done wrong, is easily forgiven. Divine is anxious that you should get your Realization. Very anxious. So, you don’t now put down yourself, by saying, "I am guilty, I've done this, I've done that or I've committed sin. These ideas should not come into your head at all. There is nothing like sin, when you are in the present. So forget the past and forget what you think you have done wrong. Also you have to forgive the people, all the people, in general. Not to remember whom you have to forgive, why you have to forgive, but just in general you just forgive. It's such a great relief you don't know, if you will forgive. This Agnya chakra just releases. If you just say, "I forgive everyone", it opens out, and it's so good, that once you have forgiven, then Kundalini just shoots off. But most of the time I have seen, when they come to Me, meet Me, Then I have to tell them, “Please forgive, please forgive, please forgive” and then it works out. It makes it easier, just you, just forgive everyone. As it is, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don't do anything, do you? Nothing. What happens? It’s just a myth. Just a myth. But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands. The other person, who has troubled you or tortured you is quite happy, but you are tortured, you are playing into the hands of such a person. So best thing is to forgive. Forgiveness is a very important in Sahaja Yoga. So, I would request you to forgive everyone, before starting this. Is a very simple thing, which one has to do, is that we'll take out our shoes. Those who are upstairs, can come down, will be better. There are seats in front also, if some people want to come. All right? Just put some water. Will you show them there? All right, just a minute. Just move down. There are some people who are waiting, to come in. Now, Frank will show you, how we are going to raise our own Kundalinis. It's very simple method to understand, very simple. First of all, you put your left hand towards Me, which represents your wish, your desire to get Self-Realization. Just please put it, left hand like that. Be comfortable. You need not sit with a slouch, you need not put with a very, too much straight. Just simple. So, left hand, we put like this, and with the right hand we nourish our centers on the left hand side, nourish our centers on the left hand side. Put both the feet apart from each other. Now, put your right hand on your heart, because right hand stands for action, or the power of action. On the heart. Here resides the Spirit, as I told you. Then we have to put our right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen. Just now, you see all this, and later on you will close your eyes and follow it. We have to work only on the left hand side. In the upper portion of the abdomen, on the left hand side. Then we take down our right hand in the lower portion of our abdomen. This is the center which manifests the divinity on our central nervous system. That means we become knowledgeable, gnostics, the bodha. Now, you have to rise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. Now, this is the center, which is the center of mastery. Great saints, prophets, have created this special center for us, so we have to enlighten this one also. Then we take our right hand on our heart. As I told you, this is the center of our Spirit. Then we take our hand in the corner of our neck and our shoulder, and put our right hand on the back side of it and turn our head to our right. This is the center which is disturbed when we feel guilty. Then we take our right hand onto our forehead across, and push it down as much as we can. Allow the head to rest on it. Now press it on both the sides. This is the center to forgive others. Take down our hand. Take up on the back side of our head and put our head resting on it, upward. This is the center to ask for forgiveness from Divine, without feeling guilty. Then we stretch our hand, we stretch our palm. The center of our palm we put it on the fontanel bone area. And bend our head, as much as we can. Now, push back your fingers. Please, push back your fingers, so there is a sufficient pressure on your scalp. And now you have to move your scalp seven times, very slowly, clockwise. Now, it’s done. That’s all we have to do. You can take out, take down your spectacles if you want, because sometimes even eyesight improves. And now you have to close your eyes. Untill I tell you please, don’t open them. Please, don’t open them. Remember to keep your feet apart from each other, and just this left hand like this. Like this, bend you head, push back your fingers, and move your scalp like this, seven times, slowly. This is important. You push back your fingers, then there is a pressure, and you can do it much better. All right? Now, let’s see. Please, close your eyes! But you should be pleasantly pleased towards yourself. You have to forgive yourself and you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourselves. Not to be angry with yourself, that is very important. Now, put your left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart. Close your eyes, please! Here, you have to ask Me a question. As you ask a computer, you have to ask a question. You can call me Shri Mataji or you can call me Mother, ”Mother, am I the Spirit?“ Ask this question in your heart three times. Not loudly, in your heart, three times, ”Mother, am I the Spirit?“ It's a very important question. Now, you take down your hand, onto the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and press it hard. If you are the Spirit, you are your master. So now ask another question to Me, three times, in your heart, ”Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own guru?” Ask this question three times. As I've told you, I cannot cross over your freedom, which I respect. And I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So, now, please, put your right hand in the low portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. And ask “Mother, please, give me pure knowledge!” Say it six times, because this center has got six petals. So please say, “Mother, please, give Me pure knowledge”. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, there's movement in your Kundalini, which you may not feel. It's rising, so we have to nourish the higher centers, with our self-confidence. So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, in the left hand side, on the left hand side, and here you say with full confidence ten times, “Mother, I am my own master“. It's very good for people who have been specially tortured by other gurus. ”Mother, I am my own master”. Please, say it ten times. So now, raise your right hand onto your heart, where resides the Spirit. And the Spirit is the state, to which you have to rise. With full confidence now, raising your hand to your heart, with full confidence, you have to say, “Mother I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the Spirit”. Say it twelve times, please. The Divine is the ocean of knowledge and love. It is the ocean of bliss and peace, but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. So you cannot do anything, which cannot be forgiven by that great power of forgiveness. So now, you raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, push it back as much as you can, and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times, with full confidence, “Mother, I’m not guilty at all”. Please, say it with full confidence. I’ve already told you, that whether we forgive someone or don't forgive, we don't do anything. But if we don’t forgive, then we play into wrong hands. So, please, now, raise your hand to your forehead and put down your head, slowly. Let it rest on your hand and press it hard on both the sides. This is the center where we have to forgive everyone. So, please, say it from your heart, from your heart, not how many times, “Mother, I forgive everyone”. Is very important! Please, say this, from your heart. Open your heart and say, “Mother, I forgive everyone”. Now, take back your right hand on the back side of your head, and turn in upward as far as possible. Let it rest on your hand. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, without blaming yourselves for anything, just for your satisfaction, you have to say in your heart, opening your heart, not how many times, “Oh Divine, if I have done any mistake, please forgive me”. In humility you have to say, “Oh, Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please, forgive me.” Now, stretch your palm, right hand palm, please, and put the center of your palm on your fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now, put down your head, as far as possible. Now press it hard, push back your fingers nicely, press it hard and you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise. But again, here, I cannot cross over your freedom, which I respect. So, you will have to say, “Mother, please, give me my Self-Realization”. I cannot force on you. Please, say it seven times, “Mother, please, give me my Self-Realization!” Push back your fingers please, push back your fingers. Move it. Put down your heads. Put down your heads. Now, please, take down your hands. Open your eyes, slowly. Put the hands towards Me, like this. Now, put down, push your hand, right hand like this towards Me, and put down your head, and see for yourself with the left hand, if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. May be little hot, doesn’t matter. But it will be some sort of a heat or a cool coming out of your head. You have to certify yourself. Don’t worry about the air conditioning. It's coming out of your head. Now, put the left hand towards Me and put your right and again and see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now change over again, once more. Put the right hand towards Me and put down your head, and see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze, coming out of your fontanel bone area. You have to put it above, not on it. Above, some people can have it little far away, some will have it closer. But you don’t have to touch your head. Now, push back both your hands. Raise them, raise them like this. Push back your head, and ask the question, “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" "Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of God’s love?" "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?” Ask this question, one of them, three times. Keep your eyes upward and ask this question. Now, take down your hands. Just keep them. Try to watch Me without thinking. You can do it. You feel very relaxed. You can put on your glasses, if you like. Just put your hands towards Me like this. Those who have felt the cool breeze out of their head or on their fingertips, whether hot or cold, please, raise both your hands. Practically, all of you have felt it. May God bless you! Just imagine! I bow to all the saints. Now, you have to just know how to establish it and to work it out. It's very simple. You have a very good center here, where people will tell you all about it. There is nothing to be paid for, just you have to give little time to yourself and you must respect your Self-Realization. Gradually, you will grow into it. And I hope next year, I will see you here as big trees grown. Very happy to meet you all. All those who have not felt it can come on one side and the Sahaja Yogis can see them; And those who have felt it, I would like to meet them, one by one. I’d like to shake hands.

P: We are living here.

Shri Mataji: All right, that's very good.

P: I've been enjoying listening to You. I was very interested as I have breast cancer.

P: That's why I was interested to hear what You said about breast cancer. Shri Mataji: Was that the reason?

P: Yes.

P: What was that?

Shri Mataji: Is that the reason, you are insecure?

P: Yes, yes, there's nothing. I always think that You say it. Yes.

Shri Mataji: You have seen that?

P: No, no that's leaving me now.

Shri Mataji: Now it's all right. You'll be all right. Is that the reason?

P: Yes it is.

Shri Mataji: It is the reason. That’s why in the West, see women are very insecure. And men must understand this, the way they go on with this woman, that woman.

P: I don't, I believe that I can’t expect him to understand, but I understand it myself now and that's important.

Shri Mataji: It is better to be yourself. See that the whole joy is with you.

P: Yes, I'll try. I understand that. Thank you.

Shri Mataji: So, now, how are you?

P: Very good. Thank You, Mother. You, great! Now you must develop it within yourself. So develop it. You become a master of it. It is very easy, it's very simple. Because is so innate within you so you just become that. But you must know how to manage it, how to give Realization, so you can help so many people. So how are you? Oh you, very good. Wonderful.

P: What is there?

Shri Mataji: You will see, the cool. Shri Mataji: So, how are you?

P: I don't [put in] to understand.

Shri Mataji: All right, now, that's a [unclear]. Did you forgive?

Shri Mataji: Did you forgive everyone?

P: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Really? No, you did not. Now forgive. Now forgive, before Me you better forgive. Forgive, forgive. Now, is there a cool breeze now? Now, you didn't forgive. Just forgive. Just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone". Just say that. Say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.” All right? It's releasing now? Such a headache is over if you forgive. Why to carry this headache of not forgiving? Now, see? May God bless you!

Shri Mataji: So, how are you?

P: Good, good.

Shri Mataji: Please, forgive.

P: I got it stronger in one hand than in the other.

Shri Mataji: In this hand you had strong? Yes. What work you do?

P. Brick liner. Brick liner.

P: Brick liner.

Shri Mataji: I didn't understand.

P: Brick liner.

Shri Mataji: Bricklayer, bricklayer. That’s a physical work. That’s why. Now, it's better now? May God bless you! Little, one goes into imbalance, because you are doing a physical work. The left is less. So they will teach you how to get into balance. That's all. All right? May God bless you!
