Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Southlands College, London (England)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) â€“ Draft

It was really nice to have this seminar organized here at such a short notice with no proper planning or anything and you got such a nice place also spontaneously the whole thing has worked out and everything is managed.

But today you saw the new people who came where an example of the dearth of seeking in this country or maybe there is some sort of lacking on the part of English Sahaja Yogi's also. The way that because I'm here people take things for granted or maybe that there are few like Gavine and others are very anxious trying to do their level best to do this. And I think on two points might be we are failing. One point is that we all must know what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. Some people take two or three posters and post them then they think they have done everything. No. You have to do much more than anywhere else because you are placed in this important thing called the heart. Everybody has had an advantage of Sahaja Yoga has been helped a lot. We have to think what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. It has done so much for us what have we done for Sahaja Yoga.

That's very important. So then there should be I think I was expressing that anxiety which the people who are your leaders and those who are worried about Sahaja Yoga in England. And my lecture, the whole lecture has that tremendous concern and then we have to think what have we done. We have houses, we have places, we have ashrams, we have families, we have wives, we have everything. The Sahaja Yoga still if it is by the way then this is the result you get twenty nonsensical arrogant people. You don't get realization some of them get it and get out. So I think this is on one side is this that what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. There should be in other countries I am not there. So for them when I go there even for four, five days the whole place is filled with my posters, the whole place. It has to be done every time I speak.

The whole of London should have been today filled with my posters. I mean anybody who goes to say Switzerland or to Rome or to Paris they tell me Indians that we saw your posters all over the place but never has happened in London. Now I hope this is not the last program, public program in England but still one has to work very hard. All of you should think what you can do because everybody has taken things in their own style like the leaders are worried, they are working hard, they are all trying to do things and arrange things, all that. But what have you done is the point. Now some people have had failures say for example some people had failures with the officials and with the government or with the TV. Doesn't matter we know we have failed there. But advertising, post-train, talking about it, going around it, all that can be done. This one part is very good in this respect is that outside London things are working out better. But how many of you have been doing that?

Very few. The same party goes here, same party has to do it all the time. Now this is one side of the picture is that the advertising and all that has to be done more intensely extensively. And everybody must offer their full support and services. On the seminar side you are all very good, everything is done well, I agree. So many things are, because we have to do so many things together. But still you are being the heart, you have to be like that, what can you do? That's one part of it. The second part of it I feel is, like we had in Hamstead about 300 people and they came and what I have learnt is that when they came to the program nobody was sort of open hearted, sort of talked to them in that way as they should have. Some of you did, but not all.

Most of you are just sitting down. Like if they come to my house they'll just sit down, put hands like this. You cannot. You cannot just do that, it's not done. Come to my house, sit down like this. Always they will come and sit down and put hands like this. You can't do like that. That shows you are very insular, very selfish and also in a way arrogant. You cannot take my vibrations without my permission, can you? So this is suggestive of one thing, that what we do is to take things for granted and when we talk to others also it takes time for an Englishman to get up.

That's the thing is. Now the quality of this is this, that in English do not want to interfere with anyone. They want to leave them alone. It's not the bad thing. They want that why should we interfere, aggress. That's the point. But that's not the point now. We have to aggress. This is the thing I'm bringing you to. That means you don't mean that.

But what you mean is that not to interfere. See they don't discuss religion in England. You are not supposed to say these things. You are not to discuss whether you are a miss or a missus. You are not to say whether you have children or not. If you ask somebody a question, you have you got children. That means the most offensive thing. You are not to discuss anybody's family. There are so many don'ts in this country so that we do not also sort of get up worried that maybe this may be taken as an interference. But just opposite are Americans.

They will go up to the great grandfather and up to the whole progeny to find out. So interference should be forgotten. There should be no fear about them. But open your heart and talk to them openly with an open heart. But people receive back. Once they receive back, others also somehow or other get frightened. Because they think you are just like them. You have to be different to attract them. So amongst English Sahaja Yogis there are some who are very anxious, very much worried that being so much working it out. Some of them are really indifferent.

And the middle part is those who are still trying to see how far to go, how far not to go, you have to be aggressive about it. I mean as if now I feel the English have aggressed so much that now they are so fed up with aggressiveness. That's the thing I want you to have today, to be aggressive. Aggressiveness is the only way you can reach these people, otherwise they won't understand. And you have to talk to them on their faces. I have seen how people talk. If you talk to them like that they are alright. Unless and until you work out that way when the people come, you talk to them in an aggressively loving manner. Do you understand that? Exuberance.

Just open out your heart. How come long, come long, where are you going, sit down, what do you want, you want. One minute English one will look like this, you see. Second minute. You must understand your own character that exists in those people also. The language starts, I am afraid. So aggressively compassionate, aggressively loving, aggressively open hearted. Non-interference and all those ideas are out of date now, finished. Now openness, no arrogance, no anger but openness. Aggressive innocence people, like children are.

Children are so aggressively innocent that you like it. I mean if they catch hold of you they will all come and jump on your body and sleep on top of you. Kissing you all over. That's how. You have to be aggressively loving and aggressively good. What you want, you want something to eat, you want this, that, that. They will be surprised how these English people have become like this. So on these two things we fail. And this anguish and this anxiety that I have is one of the expressions of the modern times, that's known. It's of the modern times, you see.

Because modern times are so funny that if you click it, you click it. And if you don't click it, you missed. It's so important. So precarious is the word. So precarious. At this time if you don't click it, it's finished. So I find everyone is capable of doing lots of things for Sahaja Yoga. But what have we done for Sahaja Yoga? Nice in the seminar, a common enjoy is good ideal. Enjoy Sahaja Yogis, Mother is collecting them.

One of the examples is that from the other countries people come. They are sick, they have problems, they are dying. Immediately telephone will ring, we are saying, Mother somebody has come with ten boots and fifteen baboots. So what? When should that person see you? I said, the person or the boots? And the boots only come. The person is missing. At least you can reduce some numbers and then send such a person. Now I started using the hearth of my house instead of the candle.

Now will you please look after the boots of the people when they come. And among you are there are many like that. Your children are caught up, some of the wives are caught up, some of the husbands are caught up. But nobody pays attention, carrying on with them. Sometimes even supporting. And just I see them even staying in ashrams I must say, some of them are really Bhutish and troublesome. And you think that you have to tolerate this no crucifixion needed anymore. If somebody has a boot, better tell that person you are catching. I mean I don't want to tell. But you know what happens to me?

My hands and my feet they all go crazy. And there's a Bhutish person around. So I just run away. In the same way it should happen to you. And you should try to correct that person. But nobody but the Mother. You see because you think correction will be too much. Oh, maybe he might feel hurt and he run away. Let him run away. Take two running jumps and go to hell.

But the whole thing should be a concern and anxiety and loving way. Then you will attract that person. I mean today I was really so full of vibrations. Nothing would be sucked in. These horrible twenty people or whosoever they were. They were stopping you also from sucking me. I mean they were more powerful than you are in your suction I think. So now there's something wrong with us. What is that wrong is what have we done for Sahaja Yoga, for Sahaja Yoga? Second is what am I doing about myself?

Where am I? Nice to ask a question. What's the difference between a God realized and a Self realized? God realized never catches. Just knows. Now why do I feel horrible? Only with Sahaja Yogis, not with non Sahaja Yogis. Even Narakasura comes before me, I can kill him. But Sahaja Yogis are inside my body, what am I to do? They are part and parcel of me, they are not foreigners.

So when they get sick I get sick myself because they are inside myself. No deity has done that. No incarnation has done that job. Nobody has injected Sahaja Yogis inside their body. Has anyone done that way? You are all inside my body, part and parcel. When something goes wrong with you, it goes wrong with me inside. Naturally if I take it, it's in discriminate you can say. But if I were not in discriminate, how many would have gone inside my body? That's how I can cleanse you.

I can look after you, I can know about your workout things very well. Something happens to someone in Australia, I can work it out here because he is in my body. That's why I get sick. I can say I get caught up. Because I've got boots within me. So you must keep out your boots. This is the third point, very important. How can I have boots in me? How can I have left side or right side or anything? I am in the body of mother.

Who is the Adi Shakti? What a privilege, what an honour. So now I can't have any boots within myself. It has to be something very pure. So try to purify yourself, keep yourself pure. What I am saying now is for English, is for all of you. English being always the leaders for starting something good, I have to talk to them more. They have done it because they were the ones who fought the war, won it and that's how we started under tides. But now the instruments that we are going to use have to be that powerful. If Europeans among them say Brussels people come up very well, then I'll shift my attention.

We can shift heart these days, transplant is possible. Have you heard of heart from right, moves to the left or left to the right? God can do it. There are people born with the heart on the right hand side also. So to be very precise, I think that this seminar should be used for also having an inner insight. Seeing what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. That will help. Secondly, very important is, are we open-hearted? Now for example, we can say like this, that supposing I am in the house and the bell rings up. If there's an American, he'll say I'll get it, he'll be the first to run.

And English would be looking this side, that side. Because a kind of a lethargy that is settled in. Because that's the idea of the negative to freeze the heart. And that freezing is to be avoided. I'll get it, I'll do it. I'll work it out. I have to do it. That must be told. All the English Sahaja Yogis must know that they have to be the most active people. Do you know, even when we sleep, when the heart is beating, all the time till we exist.

So I have to tell you that you bear a very big responsibility to Sahaja Yoga. That's why I've been here, I've been with you. And that doesn't mean you should take things for granted. You can do a lot. You have to circulate. Maybe English Sahaja Yogis will have to travel a lot. But first of all, first and foremost, open your heart. Talk openly and sweetly. You have children, learn from them how they talk, how sweetly they move. Really open your heart.

And less than until you open your heart, how can you do anything for anybody else? And that's what one has to achieve. I am sure next program I can see myself all over London. All right? Now don't feel guilty. I am getting terrible pain. Don't feel guilty. Face it. Yes, it's true. Don't feel guilty about it.

For heaven's sake don't feel guilty because I am now getting a terrible pain again. Huh? Food is? The food is arrived. All right? So we can have some music, all right? Then I'll go because tomorrow I have to come for your puja. So if you don't mind, tomorrow about eleven o'clock we'll start the puja. But those who have to cancel their thing, I hope you manage that tomorrow. I bless you with that.

May God bless you. The lunch is absolutely fixed at this place. It's twelve o'clock. They won't move one minute. One fifty. One fifty. We can start at ten o'clock. We can start puja at ten. I mean for me it's all right. I can even start at nine.

But what about you people? Ten minutes. I can start at six. But just now. I mean whether we could have it after lunch it would be better. No, but what about others? No, it's better to have it before. No, it's, you see actually it's this, there is, I don't know what sort of puja it is going to be because see it's a Vishnu Maya's, this thing you see. So we can have a short puja of Vishnu Maya. It's all right.

It has to be done in the night, no doubt, in the sense that, you know. But it doesn't matter. It's no difference. You can call it a global puja, some sort of a general puja, you can call it. I don't know. Vishnu Maya is something so powerful. All right. So let's have some music and then I'll go back. Just tell her not to wait for my food at home. This girl, if not she should eat her food.

So let's see now what is the contribution. Now you have seen the music that has come from Nasi. What a professional music it was. Did you hear that? Now what have you to produce? Just look at that. It was a real professional thing they have done. So we should try to find out something better. All right? Now let's have some music.

Wow, what do you think you are going to be eating so much? All right, all right, all right. What is cooked in? This one. And this one. And that is plain gold. Plain. Plain one I'll have. And that I can have. All right?

I'll try to manage something. Now let's have some music. Okay. Okay. Now for India too. You see this may be there as I told you. I didn't know this year. This year or maybe next year, maybe the last year. I can't say. The reason is once we have established our ashrams in India, I don't think I'll be able to take all this around all the villages and all that.

Once we have ashrams they will all come down to see us there. In India for them it's a pilgrimage and they go out of the way to do it. So when you people are coming there, after once we have established our ashram, there won't be any of these India tours much, which you have enjoyed very much. Maybe this might be the last year or next year. I don't know. Depends on as soon as we have established ashram. Now I see that people do not understand the value of Indian tour also. It does not have good to you because it's a country which is heavenly, I should say, as far as vibrations are concerned. In terms of feel we are living in hell here because I see the TV on horrible things and I mean it's really terrible. There are so many Indians who have come here and they say that they lose their vibrations.

Not only here, America anywhere. So the Indian tour, though apart from anything else itself, is visiting India is still a clearer country, especially Maharashtra. Now, it's time to make it convenient. We have made it for three weeks. So you are there only for three weeks, two weeks, around, at one week, around the sea, sure. Now actually we will not have many public programs. But that is something every year, if you cannot do it, at least alternate years should have been done. I find that, that people don't understand the importance of Indian tour. Ninety-nine percent people who have been to India settle down in Sahaja Yoga. There must be something about it.

So those who are going to eat, and now we have made it the minimum possible. Though everybody warned us, Warren said that it's going to be very expensive, it is ten times more, everything is there. Whatever minimum we have put. Luckily also Air India, because it had so many accidents, it has gone very cheap. And you people should know that if you have to go pay the money in time, you are still waiting for last minute. I'm going to be here for a month, I know that. But that doesn't mean that you should take so much time. It's like a pilgrimage. And everybody should try. Everybody should try.

I cannot manage many, but quite a lot we can manage now, because we have made two tours now. In case you cannot manage the first tour, you come for the second tour. But it's not so difficult. But if you see, I have now noticed people quite closely that people waste their money alone. Just the other way round Indians are. You know, they keep all the money just for my tour there. Keep all their holidays, all their money for the tour. Though they do not gain so much as you people gain, because it's a new world you go to. So those who are coming should decide, but those who are not coming also must think it over. It's not difficult.

It's better. I hope this is not the last time, but maybe I can say. Because once we have an ashram, then why need not go all over there? Indians will all come from all over India, they'll come. People are already coming from Madras, even if I have a small little room, they come down. Because we have no place to make them stay, that's why. Otherwise you will be surprised, they will be all there. You won't be able to see yourself there, it will be so many. Before that starts, you must understand that you have to go to India, some all over. At least once.

Next year or this year, you have, but I can't even promise next year, I really tell you, I must say that 90% next year we'll have the program again. Because it's becoming very difficult, very difficult money wise also, and otherwise it's becoming sun-wielding. So I would request you to think it over, and those who want to come should give your names. Even if you have not paid the money, you can do it because I'm here for this month. So those who have not yet given your names also can give your names to Gaveen, I will adjust it. But I cannot make it, I mean, I wanted to make it much cheaper for you, but it's not the food that is expensive, it's the traveling. But now traveling has become much cheaper. But everything is by the way, that's the cowardice, by the way. You see, if you want to save money, and people will save money to buy Rolls-Royce, which cost, I don't know how much, for that horrible fellow in one year. And Sahaja Yogis can't have money to go to India, I can't believe it.

At least once everybody should go by gym, because it helps, helps them such a lot. I myself never knew that it would help so much, but I now believe it does help. So those who have not yet given money also can give their names to Gaveen, or to their leaders. We'll be staying for seven days on the seashore, on a beautiful, one of the best in the whole world. Vrishhti Ganesha is there, and the water of the sea comes out of his naabi, and only his lower body you can see. The head is the mountain itself. You can see the lights coming out of it, only the Sahaja Yogis can see. I don't know about next year also. But it should not be a thing that is sort of a, by the way, that's important. That's important.

So let us see what's happening, because Australians are quite a lot coming, and we have to see about others also. All right? May God bless you. That's something I see. Now look at the music they have produced, the quality. Try to compete with them. Just think of it. And I know he got his Realisation only last year. Last year this fellow got his Realisation. In one year.

We have made copies of that music for you people to be given you as presents only to the leaders. And drums. That will be a good idea. From Bristol. Let me see. Where is Chris Wakefield? You sent me? You know, I told them it was Chris Wakefield who wrote. But they said, no, Chris Wakefield is not a writer. Another Chris is a writer.

But I tell you, there's a poet. Poets are not writers. That's the trouble is. Very much. But what about them? Where are they? They haven't brought. Oh, I'll bring them tomorrow, I think. Beautiful. But it's a real poet at it.

Real poet. Poetry is so great. You see, now I'll tell you one thing about poetry. In the poetry, poetry means there has to be magic in the word. When you say something, it must have a magic. If there's no magic, then it's not poetry. Then the second thing is that it's precise. It has to be precise. It has to be small words, sentences. Like many propositions and all that are to be dropped out.

Adjectives to be dropped out, meaning you are allowed. So many adverbs can be dropped out. But mainly what you can drop out are articles. Absolutely. Third is that it must have rasa. Rasa means the essence. It must have the essence. And the essence are according to Indian science, are nine tabs. Must have any essence. Now this is the essence today is of bhakti.

When you are singing of bhakti and devotion, then you have to use words, extremely gentle words, gentle words, beautiful words, words that are delicate, the words that express devotion through humility, words of humility. Now what I see now with your compositions is that two types. One is addressed to others and one addressed to Me. In the others you have addressed some to the other people who are not Sahaja Yogis. Some your own Sahaja Yogis together and some are addressed to Me. So there are three types of compositions you have done. Now when you are addressing to others, you need not be that delicate. Like what you say, come and see, listen, look up. This is what you should do. In a gentle way they won't understand.

So you have to use words which are sort of forcing them, pushing into it. What are you doing? This is the poem, same way written down. And very good poem, no doubt. But in this poem, whatever you have written, this one, is good, nice and everything fine. But what I find is still a little bit diplomacy. Now if you say how many of you want to be saved today, they'll say all of us. How do you count? How do you find out? So the question should be asked in a way in reality, in totality.

Actually, honestly, put these adjectives in between so that then people understand honestly, are we honest? But they'll also be, we all want to seek. We are all sick as you are sick as you are sick as, why should we run after Mother? All right? So honestly, and all those things sort of, you see, make it look more objective. You fix them. You hem them up. Otherwise they'll slip out. In whatever you're seeing, it should be such that they are pushed into a point, they have no escapes left. So when you write now, next time, that's a very good poetry, no doubt, but correct it when you address to others.

See that they have no escape. That they cannot bhaja. All right, Vivaan? You are a scholar, so I must ask you permission. Now, the second one is when we are singing among ourselves. Now, the thing that is joy, joy is a very good one. But we are not addressing to folk people. That's the point. We are addressing to intellectuals. So that's a good one between ourselves when we sing.

We have to address to the intellectuals so we can challenge relatives. You say, what have they got? With the intellect, what did I get? With this, I what did I get? All these barren things, useless things, you've found nothing, not a single friend. And then come down what I got in search of. This relative description should be given. So I hope some of you will write poetry on that. The third one is what Wakefield has done, is my description and devotion to you. Come out, Bhairebaal, I must say.

I think that's the highest one can do. That's the best. But still we need all this, we have to have. Otherwise we cannot manage. So that's a part of it. But the essence of it, the praise, where many great poets, many great writers, many great saints and incarnations have aspired to sing the praise of the Mother. It's a great aspiration. Like Markandeya did that. Today also we did it after fourteen thousand years. Then Adi Shankaracharya did that.

So poetry of that level should come out. I would request you to read those poems, poetry of those people who compose such high class books that not a word can be changed, not to be added. And that's how you try to perfect it. Try to perfect it. When you have written it down, sit down, think over it, again try to bring in better words. Try to put better words. So you actually make it a perfect poetry, a perfect setting. That's it. But a poet is a poet born poet. It's a thing that is born and even after Sahaja Yoga many people suddenly become poets.

Like Damle never used to, he's an engineer, never is to write but wrote very well. Very beautifully. Poems are very good even now I think he's very good. But there was another fellow, Kade, who did beautiful writing. I don't know where are his poems lost but they are somewhere. And such tremendous things he has written. I was amazed. But he said, I don't write, the Saraswati is writing in me. So for that you see, the spontaneity is alright but you have to have the technique to write. The technique must be there and the spontaneity I'll look after.

So you have to also develop a little bit of technique how to write it out. In these three categories you write of different type. So when you write about your mother, you have to be absolutely sure. Absolutely one and absolutely surrendered. So the whole thing can be an epic, absolutely the top most thing that one can do in poetry is to write the praise of the Mother. That's the highest. So all the poetry is very nice, comes out of very generous heart and also very great hearts. But it has to have a technique. And the technique is to be little bit understood in a divine way that what makes it a thing that throbs in your heart. So that you will see yourself that will throb in your heart.

If you are detached about it you will do it and you will do it very well. I was so happy about Chris's. I told them it is Chris Wakeful who has written to me. They thought that it is Chris who has done this from Bristol. So I said alright let me ask first of all Chris from Bristol. Beautiful poetry, beautiful is done. Alright, so best of luck to you for all these good poems and poetry that you have done and all these pieces are extremely beautiful. But we have to perfect it, make it better and better and in tune with divine vibrations. So you should say vibrations also. What gives you the best vibrations?

Tunes could be simple, could be complicated, could be magical, could be anything. But the poetry must not narrate but create magic. Sanskrit really says when it is there is a magic, the light of the magic. When there is a light of the magic then you should call it the poetry. When there is a rasa then there is kave, there is poetry. Otherwise no, without rasa there is no. Now this is the part where the composer is concerned. Now for the part of the ones who have to sing, to sing from your heart. Knowing before whom you are singing, from your heart. You are not singing for yourself, you are singing for me, singing for the whole universe.

Say it from your heart knowing that I am before you, understanding that. Secondly you must have the technique of singing it, it is very important. All these techniques are built in through tradition by understanding whatever is not proper is thrown away. It should not be that one line close, long, another line comes short, long. There should be a proper technique about it, how to do it. See like a free verse business is no good for Sahaja Yoga. So that technique you have to know how to sing it with that the music. But the drum is an essential part of every music because that is the part where Anahata is placed. So in sound drum has to be there. When you are singing there has to be drum as well as other accompaniments.

Any accompaniments you have but drum is an essential part that has to be there. And the whole thing should be on a rhythmic understanding that you see, you have seen how Indians have a rhythmic understanding you see. They cut it into three halves, four halves, they bring it back and how they cut it, how they go off beat. It's really too much but you can compose to a great extent on those lines. And that technique has to come properly understood. Like singing in parts itself is a big technique and one has to understand how you do it. But there are so many other things which you have is tremor, you have yoddling. I don't know if you are used those things or not at all but you should use in music. There are so many things you have which all of these things you should use which helps a lot in music. I don't know much about western music but whatever I am.

And these things if you use it will help a lot to bring out the music in its proper way. And I don't know if you have any sopranos singers also. And the way they sing beautifully you have to have some of them. So in between a soprano singer can sing in between. But should be made a proper, sensible, organized thing. Because to the public they can't understand this. And another could be hippy style of music. I don't mind even that. It's alright. But if it is sung with the heart, with that devotion, like a folklor, it will be very good.

But should be so fast and so accurate and so clear cut that people should feel this is something so great. So you can have all varieties, you can have classical style, you can have this yoddling style. And then you can have, you have many styles you can sing like that. We too have. Like for the tapes you have heard now is we have two tapes which are absolutely folk. I don't know if you have noticed, it's a very fast number. The first one is. And the first one is about how the abstract without form, the formless has become. Has appeared now into form. The first one is such a fast number.

So I hope you have heard it. Have you heard it clearly? Who would like to hear once again? Just play the first one. Nirguni. Nirguni is without any mistake. So now when you see, hear that, try to grasp it. I think in music Indians are very well off. No doubt about it. I mean no doubt about it.

They are very well off and their rhythms and all that, they are very systematic. They know a lot. So it's a very good thing but now you listen to the first one. The one you had just now out of that the first one. Now you see the whole thing how they have based the rhythm, the music, the poetry and the combination of everyone. How they have worked it out. Just see this point for about two, three minutes it will play. And it's a folk song. It's a folk thing. It's an extremely fast, fast music, folklor.

Absolutely what you can call the top speed it starts. So they said Nirguni, the one who was without any gunas, without any form has appeared now on the scene to give us realization. It's such a speed but it conveys and communicates the thing. Just after when they have said it that this is the thing. Only listen to one and you will understand. Just put it little forward. Little forward than this. Now that's all. Now start it. No, no, not this one.

The other way. Just on the other side, on the other side. That's a folklore, just an ordinary. Now you also catch hold of your folk lores here. Must be very fast, I'm sure. Get hold of your folk lores and their tunes and set into that. That's the best way to do it. They can be very fast. This is just a folklore and a folk style called Launi. On that it is best.

It's very fast. This is the first one. In this one the first. Now just listen to it and you will understand what I'm saying. That's an example I feel. The poetry is very high class, very high class poetry. The style is folk. It's the first one and then you stop it. You see that the one you brought is no good compared to what he was. Doesn't that know?

It's nothing, nothing compared to that. That day he was in a different mood. He was too tight together. And what will I have is the enlightened awareness. It's a colloquial but yoga. It's a village or yoga. I'll ask her for yoga. Now they have changed the tune you see. I will spend nine nights in her bhakti. My father-in-law is the banditly.

I'll give you ma. It's a woman's song. She says my father-in-law is the variety and my husband is the ego. I'll give them up. What is with him? Both are the enlightened awareness. I'll make my flowers of that. See now. I'll kill the maisha sura. All those who are bad condition is me.

I'll take them as bad eyes from my mother. I'll become unattached to everything. I've left the ego of my husband behind. I'll turn the anger. They are my relations. I've left them behind. I've asked mother for yoga and I've got it and kept it with me. Then I have given her back by spreading it all over. That is how I've got rid of all life and death cycles by giving all that back. The village style is absolutely beautiful.

It's a very, very fast song with very deep penetrating poetry, very penetrating. This is how one should understand. There has to be Sahaja Yoga words, there has to be Sahaja Yoga ideas, there has to be all these things. Otherwise we have not achieved it. Even his songs are like that. Like he says Agnya Chakra. On the Agnya Chakra I've got a bundle, bundle of love. So why have you stopped? Now open my Sahasrara. Mother, open my Sahasrara.

Let's talk of these things in our poetry. In English language you must talk of these things in this way. I was happy in the previous one. We talked of Sahasrara and all that. Let people know that you know more than them and that you have a deeper understanding of everything. That's how it should be brought in. So we have had very nice music. Thank you very much. Tomorrow again we are going to have the music of the puja. So may God bless you.

Hope to see you again tomorrow morning. All right? There's another one. You've got not ... He's the born realized. He's done some, he's a Muslim, but this recording is not good. The other one is good. Just play a little bit more. Something is floating there. Just please be seated.

Five minutes more. Then he is going to get the proper recording. Music is very important in these modern times, and one has to concentrate on that. But the poetry has to be penetrating, that's the point. And by saying all these things, you see, you'll create also curiosity for Sahaja Yoga, by using these words. Short circuiting. I think all violins is due to that, all over the world. Ha, now, what's it? Anybody else here who hasn't got it, who is a new person, you got it, madam? Just see all of them, all of them.

Those who are Sahaja Yogis sitting here, watch them. See? If all of the new people you know who are the new Sahaja Yogis, new people. Just have a look. Left Vishuddhi, don't feel guilty. If you start feeling guilty, vibrations will disappear, not to feel guilty at all. So, Raji, are you feeling guilty? While people are working on you, please just try not to think. You will know whatever you have to know and everything you are going to know. But just don't think now.

It has to happen. We know it is real. It is real. Whether you doubt it or not does not change to the fact that it is true. But just now you have to get it. So please try not to think just now. It won't help. Just a noise, that's all. Anybody, you just go and see all, check all the new people, you know who are the new. Come forward also, here some are sitting, new people are sitting here.

Just see. What do you say? Left Vishuddhi, tell him not to feel guilty. Just terrible left Vishuddhi. Just see this, madam here, lady. Are they all, realize souls here? Tell him to say not, I am not guilty, tell him to say. Keep your eyes open. Jameel, you have made copies of that? Got it?

Warren has. No, only one. This one I sent also with somebody for Warren. And now. Look at this lady, what are you doing? The Sahaja Yogis are sitting there, why don't you see them? This is what the Christ Disciple did when they got their realization. They said that they were moving their hands in such a way that people thought they were mad. Of course all mad people think all the sane people are mad, what to do? All right?

All the new people who have not really felt the cool breeze, please raise your hands. Everybody must be attended to. Just see there, are you attending? Who is there? Caleb? Is it all right? He is raising the hand there. Vishuddhi, put your hand on the Vishuddhi. Terrible Vishuddhi. This is the Sahaja Yogis from Nasik have sent a tape for you all.

We are telescopically working one program into another. It will work out.
