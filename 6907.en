Welcome many people here who have not attended a programme of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

By good fortune. We are holding a seminar here this weekend. And we had the idea to open it out to a wider public. To share with you. The remarkable discovery. Which is Saharyoka. Shrimatadinimala Devi. is an absolutely unique figure in this world. And people have come from Many European countries to Join us this weekend. I'm going to ask Gregoi de Calvermatin.

There's a Swiss national. Who has written a book on the subject. Off she marked his advent. To make a Presentation before Shimatai arrives to give you some orientation. Why it is That This is such a unique opportunity for all of us. At this juncture In our History In the national history, in the international history. In the very evolution of our species. You may hear some big words. This evening But I hope That you are people of a calibre. To seek the reality, the truth.

In big words. And not to be satisfied with superficial answers to sublime questions. We have been having And intensely joyful. Seminar We want to share that joy with you. There is a very specific way by which that joy can be shared by everyone. It's the birthright of everyone. It's nothing Especially abnormal, everyone has the potential within them. To achieve what has been promised. And we have very much. That later on, You will make a point Of Finding out for yourself individually.

How much potential you have. To transform into the Promised state Which is very blissful. Very peaceful And very nourishing which we call self-realization. After the programme, those who are interested to do so. May like to leave their name and address with us in the Foyer So that we can be in touch with you about other programmes. programmes are held regularly in London and in many other cities in this country. And we look forward to meeting you and getting to know you. So without further I do. I'll ask Gregoire to speak to you and to introducerimai, who will be here in a few minutes. Thank you.

OK Mhm All right. It's working. Um, again, good evening to everybody and most welcome. I mean, It's a very nice surroundings. We had a very jolly weekend here. And we thank you for coming this evening. Now Introducing Saja yoga Oshimata is Always a Uh privilege, although it's not a very easy topic. The reason it is not an easy topic is that the subject matter. I Slightly beyond the borders of our wildest dreams. And while presenting it, we have to be very careful not to look.

Like Somebody who would be naive to the point of idiosity, is it an English word, idiosity? OK. Because what we are talking about is self-realization. If any of us know what self realisation is about, then we know it's a very big thing. It is something that very few saints and sages of the older days used to achieve after lives of tremendous labours and penances dedicated to that very purpose, which obviously is not the situation in which I am finding myself. I am an international civil servant, I have a wife, 3 children, and so on, so that keeps me pretty busy. Uh So Self-realization while living in the world, this sounds like utopia. I have methimatajee about 10 years ago, um, slightly, slightly more, I suppose, now. And That is enough for me to know it's not utopia, it's reality. Now, I have no pretension to communicate this very truth to you. Because if I have accepted it, it is on the basis of my own experience and not because anybody would tell me so.

Actually, the people who told me so, I told them that they were. You know, killing themselves. And I would expect from you the same kind of healthy scepticism. I, you shouldn't believe me, of course. Somebody who believes people in this world today is somebody who is in for troubles because especially in the field of spirituality. You have all kind of crazy show going on in town. Unfortunately, these shows are sometimes very successful. So that for someone who is genuine but confused, which seems to be the characteristic of many seekers. Certainly, I mean, I would. Certainly Describe myself as being confused.

When I think about the state I was before I met Shrima Taju. It's very difficult to know who is genuine and who is not, who delivers the goods and who doesn't, and who is just a kind of illusion. Makers So The way to go about this riddle is just to submit to you that whatever may be said on Saja yoga isn't for you and hypothesis. And this is probably what Shi mother she will tell you also in a few minutes now. You know that for And hypothesis to Considered as a law, it has to fulfil two requirements. It has to be communicable and verifiable under certain conditions. So The hypothesis of Sajo yoga which is going to be laid down or presented for you is going to be verified for those who so desire, not for the others, of course, by a session of meditation at the end of the programme of Shrimataji in which Srimataji will again show an absolutely amazing capacity. To play this catalytical role in granting people their self-realization. So if you came here to listen to a lecture, You're like someone who came and thought he had $5. In his pockets, but it's not $5 it's $5000 because really what you can get this.

Evening is much more than analytical knowledge which is communicated by means of words. So, this is a kind of introduction to the hypothesis. And uh I assure you That the only thing it takes to Verify what is actually going on is A certain intellectual honesty, that's all. A certain genuineness. And of course the desire to know what's going on, not about saja yoga, of course, but what's going on about our own life, about the way to fulfil it. Now, the hypothesis is very simple. This is the framework of the hypothesis. And What we say is this. You have the sacrum bone which is more or less at the bottom of your spine, and energy which is Could be called in our tradition as the residual consciousness, consciousness of the Holy Spirit in man. This energy is called kundalini in Sanskrit.

Now, what we call self-realization. I That has to be defined is the following process, the process of this energy. Going up within the spine. Crossing this famous point known as the Third Eye in various esoteric traditions. Going through this beautiful flower here which Lord Buddha described as the 1000 petalled lots and oozing out of the top of the skull. Now when this takes place, what, what does it mean? What are the implications? I think Shri Mata is already coming. What are the implications of this process? First of all, you can register the process.

In I would say essentially two ways. When the energy crosses. This centre, the Agya chakra. One enters into a state. which is a state of silence. And we all know we'd rather think a lot and it's not easy to stop thinking even if we do so. I mean if we wish to do so. This state of silence. Announces The quality of what Lord Jesus Christ has described as the kingdom of God, because when one can penetrate farther into this silence. One undoubtedly.

Discover A new quality of being, and I would like to come back on this now. On the kundalini is just a couple of centimetres upwards and oozes out of the head. Then what happens? There again, what happens has been referred to in very ancient texts. What actually happens is one feel The manifestation of something. Which is A cool breeze And this is the cool breeze. Which was called asnoima or nose by the Greek fathers of the church. It was referred to also in the Bible. As This mighty wind which erupted in the house. Where the apostles were gathered for Pentecost.

There are many references in various cultures to this phenomenon that we call vibrations. What actually happens is that our central nervous system, which means this physical system by which we feel sensations, become aware of a subtle energy which was always existing before but which we could not perceive. It's like you have, let's say a radio here. I mean, if the radio is not switched on, it cannot pick up all the waves and the music which is in the room in the same way self realisation allows our central nervous system. To pick on those waves to feel these vibrations which are a spiritual energy. In other words, this is the meeting point of matter and spirit because with the material structure one becomes aware of spirit, and this is a breakthrough into. The 4th dimension, these vibrations are the category of perception that Kant was. Requiring in order to know the things in themselves. In order to know reality. And it is because at that time he said that we don't have this new or this other category of perception to know metaphysical realities, metaphysics, that is what is beyond physics.

That is why we should just limit ourselves to rationality, and from there on the whole the march, the whole direction of the Western seekers went into. Basically, this finite world and no more, this world which was keeping people like Plato and Socrates busy, the world of the things in themselves, of reality. Now this is important to know because this breakthrough in our category of perception has been sought by so many seekers. That people who know that background, would it be only intellectually know that. One thing has to happen. In order to know reality is that we have to have a new means. And this is how you'll better understand the importance of these vibrations and the importance of what can be done with them. This is such a rich and vast topic that I simply would not like to enter into it now. Now, going back to what I said a few minutes ago. This quality of silence one discovers at the level of the Agya chakra.

Is the space of reality between two thought movements. Now the action of this energy which we have called kundalini. Pushes the thoughts on the side. And then you enter in your own. Realm What actually happened is this, is that once the kundalini is at the top of the head. There is a secret link between a secret link between the head and the heart. And the heart is the seat of the self, the spirit, the atma in Sanskrit. So through this link in your consciousness in your brain, You start imbibing Ama consciousness. That means you start being aware, conscious of those qualities which are the qualities of the self, which are called sat chit ananda meaning truth. Consciousness And bliss So this is the hypothesis.

As shortly as I could. This is true. He's gonna go ahead. So The same reading as ours, I. Now As I mentioned, The very reassuring thing about Saja yoga is is that nobody is ever told to believe in anything that is not. Object of experience and perception. I also mention that for those who so desire. The verification of the hypothesis can take place at the end of this. programme. Now I should perhaps before ending tell you why it is so.

Why it is that we who are very I should say normal people. Why is it that we should be in a position to know this experience? What have we done to deserve it? I mean, if I ask this question. For myself, I'm a bit puzzled because I certainly I did not at any point ever got the feeling that I had done anything to deserve that. So it came As such a surprise to me that I should get my realisation that really for quite some time I would not quite believe that it is so. And I found out later on that many people have the same difficulty to relate to something which is so incredibly beyond our wildest dream that it's just too good to be true. In no way is the catch? I mean, it's not possible. Well, it is.

And Shimaoji is as a very which I welcome here. It's very gracious of you to have come, and we thank you so much. We certainly are very grateful to you for coming, Shimata. Um, Shimataji is a very poetical, simple image which in my view is perfect because it carries the strength of simplicity and it says it all. Shimatoji says that well, if you have a tree which starts producing flowers in the middle of winter under snow and storm, this is a miracle. And that miracle where Those great souls of the past which received their realisation at a point where the whole evolutionary process was not quite mature for this. Therefore, that will struggle in an incredible way, and this is what you learn when you study the lives of such great people. Now If this same tree is blossoming in spring, it's not a miracle. It's, it's nature's, it's nature's ways and rhythm. It is the dance of evolution.

It is the moment that that should happen. And so Shrimata she says we now have entered a time where this process of triggering our mass centralization has come. And if you study art, literature, anything, any parameter of modern civilization, you know that there is a tremendous expectation for this kind of breakthrough. And this is pretty obvious that today Englishmen, for instance, are not motivated by many things, certainly not by competing with Japanese in order to make gadgets. I mean, the economic indicators prove that they don't devote much energy to these things. So, uh, what, what, what do they care about? Uh, cricket maybe, but other things too, and actually, I would submit that it is probably an evolutionary progress to accept that GNP should decrease because one does not bother about it, but then what should we devote our attention to? And many people in this country, as in any So-called industrial countries are trying to devote more energy to the pursuit of this inner truth. The only trouble is The setup that I've described before is that there is such a big show in town that people Don't go into the right shop because first of all, they assume it has to be found in a shop. Where you can buy it, and this is the first mistake.

So Here you can't buy because it's too expensive. It's so expensive that it can only be given. She says a realisation is as important as breathing if you would have to. Puncture your bank account in order to have the right to breathe, you would be dead a long time back. And it is the same thing. So it happens now because now the time has come and it happens for another reason, and this other reason. If I may say so he is sitting before you. Now Speaking to, I would say a few people who have never had exposure to Saaja yoga, I should certainly keep a kind of sobriety while introducing Srimatai, which is difficult because our achievement I saw. Extraordinary That they are difficult to express in English, which is a language appreciating understatements. It's very difficult to understate rimataje.

I mean, we are condemned to understate her anyway. But how to give some or render some justice to her labour. The work she has been doing in this country and I should say in the whole of Western Europe, not to mention Australia and of course India. What I know is that she's a totally selfless, totally genuine person. Not only she didn't ever take any. Penny I should blush for saying such a nonsense from anybody, but The first lot of her followers in London were of such a kind of economically derelict so that she had to pay for the rent of the flat for some time. So this is one of the oddities of Saja yoga and there are many others that you will discover in due time. Srimatai Despite a tremendous power that we would not be able to face if that power would not be just. Love Despite Cities despite qualities that in my humble view, are to be found in nobody on this earth, and I've seen a lot of so-called spiritual people before I met Shri Matai. Despite all this, she's extremely Human I mean, much more than me.

I'm quite surprised about that. This, there is a word in, in Sanskrit for this. And this word is called mahamaya, and Mahamaya means the great illusion. So you have the privilege to sit this evening in front of A very, very great illusion, and this is the illusion that you are in front of a human being. It's a nice illusion though, because if you would realise that it is not so, you may run away, and this is not the purpose of the evening. So I suppose that I should end this few words by means of introduction. Thanking you very much for having. Come all the way from wherever you came. And If Saja yoga. It's full of joy.

It's full of humour. It's also a sacred reality. It is the sacred reality of our innermost divine divine being. Which opens itself if we in all humility and sincerity so wish Shimatai. I am again. In the name of everybody most graceful that you should grace this evening. And it is my humblest prayer that everybody who has come should experience their self-realization and what is even. I should say what is even as important as that should understand what great, great. Gift That evening I For them. Thank you very much.

We do flowers. Oh. Ah It's I bow to all the seekers of truth. We had no intentions of having any public programmes in England. But somehow Mr. Gavin Brown. Hopes against hopes. And they spent a lot of money. For this programme. And I only feel sorry that Every time they have a public programme, we get very few people. And even if you get last time we had about 300 people who were new.

They got some of them did touch realisation. They looked very serious. But nothing inside. We lost most of them. Because See, we have become used to our mental capacity to enact something. And not to be the reality. It's a specialty of mental people. That they talk too much. They say too much. Have nothing with them.

It's very shocking sometimes when you see. How People say things. About reality I watch sometimes television. I see people on the television. And I feel they are somewhere near reality. They are talking about reality. They understand that there's something missing in their lives. And they are looking for it. But when it comes to actualization. And to achieving what you have, whatever is your own, they become absolutely.

Mundane, frivolous. Very surprising I can't understand why it should happen. Now supposing you say. As Gregar has been. Give me certificates, late certificates he was given. And also he he's a diplomat, so diplomatically he was trying to please all of you so that you take to Sergioga. Because he doesn't want you to commit the same mistakes that most of them have committed. But despite all that, Let us face ourselves clearly. Newcomers are Absolutely a minority here, so I'm talking also to Sergio. Let us face ourselves fully.

Are we ourselves? We've got everything supposing we say right, we have seen the power of political achievement, of economic achievements, of other achievements which we call emotional achievements. But have we really faced ourselves? Have we seen ourselves? What is our quality of life? I asked an English man, I said, what is the uh quality of an Englishman? He said, It depends on how many times he goes for a see is hot. Can you imagine? What? Sea resort.

How many years back did you start going to the sea resort? I don't think we never heard about it in India. It's about 25 years back, somebody stupid fellow must be or somebody very clever maybe. But this idea that we all should go to the resort because we must get our skin full of cancer. So the quality of a Person Doesn't On a mental acceptance of something that looks new. And that's what is happening to all of us is anything new that comes. We accept it and we think we have equality. If a lady goes supposing to a disease resort. Because I meet other kind also who are not seekers at all. She'll come and tell and say now see what a tan I have.

I mean, it's so superficial, it's so frivolous, it's so nonsensical. I mean, is this the value of your life? You have come out of amoeba stage to this stage, and what are you doing about yourself? Making it 1 That sometimes really makes me feel very disappointed. And this is such a common topic all over. What are we? We are human beings. We have come out of amoeba to other stage and other stages in thousands of years. Today we are human beings. Make to achieve something great.

Nature has worked on us relentlessly, so beautifully, so delicately, so lovingly, for what? And when we just become mental according to Indian philosophers, a mental person. is nothing but a stupid fellow. egoistical person he becomes, and he becomes nothing but a stupid fellow. Because anything that comes of the mental expression. Today I was only watching about the modern art. Modern art is all right. If you know how to become super modern, that is a real life so. But this modern art. was described by a gentleman and then ultimately got into the real mood of saying something.

That is the truth He said that this all expression shows that we were barbaric and now we have become worse than barbaric. So the whole expression of our life. I Something that we have done out of our mental thing, we are so much in in imbalance. Now the main thing. One has to understand that you are made a human being by the kindness, the grace of the nature. Of God Almighty as I call it. Not by you. Not by mental thought. You have a special value. You have a very, very special value in the.

Eyes of the nature. In the working of The evolutionary process. Have we got any concept as to what is expected out of us? Are we to waste our life? Into these frivolous stupid things, doing everything very seriously though. They're very serious about all stupidity, especially they talk for a greater stupidity. They are more serious. The thing without that there won't be any impression on people. But the main thing is we have missed the point. The point is you have to be the spirit.

All these doings are to be the spirit. It's not talking, it's not your mental projections, all your new ideas coming up and going up. It's not that. It is you have to be the spirit. Face it. This you cannot purchase in the market. You cannot. You cannot put in any effort. Now you are that just to become that. That's what your quality is.

That's what I see you as. Or anybody who is a realised soul. But what do you see yourself as is the main point. That's why there cannot be much report. Anything new that is brought to you. Well, it's nice. How, how do you know? Traditions we have put on one side because tradition means all conditioning, all wrong things, tradition we don't want, right. So now what are you clinging to? At least tradition had one safe point that trial and error, you have found out something sensible.

Now you put tradition all nonsense. Why? Because you cannot take out the good out of that tradition. So now you are going to the other side. Saying all right, no tradition we have this new style. We don't want to be covered by any tradition. Like people might say, what is in a painting of say. Marlo, whom I like very much, say. What is so great? We can do some drip painting.

They have drip painting. I don't know what sort of paintings they have these days. Why should we? You can't do even one painting like that. You can't even reproduce. You cannot think of such a painting. Face it, Modern mind is incapable of conceiving that. Exit You have gone down in quality. Why? Because of mental Movement It's such a limited movement.

But those people believed in something higher. High higher ideals. They thought of God. They thought of perfecting themselves. Not putting the chaos in your heart outside, no, perfect. Resting in that. Believing in that, in that peaceful atmosphere, they created something that you cannot produce. Only thing what you can do, I don't like it. Like in my house. I was screen made in S Saranpur a long time back.

It's beautifully done. It has got beautiful honeycomb work which no one can. Found some people came to see. I don't like it. I said, Can you make even 3 inches of that. That's the only thing you can do is to say I don't like it finished. Can you do 3 inches? Can you? You can't Accept this fact. Once you accept this fact, I'm sure the humility that is needed will come into you.

Humidity is lacking. Seekers must have humility, otherwise they will go to people who will pamper their egos, and they will be drifted into nonsensical until their money is finished, till they become absolutely lunatics or epileptics. They will just continue and finish off. But to be sensible, to be sane, one has to understand. That our worth is much more than this. Like a BBC fellow comes and tells me, I mean, he thinks he's raising you, I don't know what whatever you may call it, that an Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand. Anything spiritual for which you don't have to pay. I really tell you, he said it to me. And I refused to go on that BBC because I said first of all, your Anglo-Saxon brain must be all right. Is it a special brain you have made, Anglo-Saxon brains?

Are they specially made by God? When you say you are Anglo-Saxon brain, you have absolutely put down your value down. And when you say it's a human brain, then you are great because you become one. Of that rich world. There's no global sense. We don't have a global sense. At all within ourselves. What we have is so localised and Insular understanding. So insular that we just say I don't like it. I don't want it.

Who is this? I? It is only possible when we come to some humility. With all respect to England because England to me is very great. And it's the heart of the universe. And when I say this in the European countries, they get rather upset by the what England is the heart. That's too much, mother, we can't digest this. It is the heart, whether you like it or not. It is the heart. No doubt.

But what a heart. Can't break it, you know. Cannot make it expand. This is the sad part of English is. It's the heart. It's a very important organ of the universe, but the cells that exist here. Who are supposed to circulate in the whole world. Who have to achieve so many things as the cells of the heart. achieved by pumping out. New refreshed blood.

He is expected to have beautiful heart, an Englishman. A heart that is to be cherished. To be enjoyed and appreciated. Where are they? With all this expenditure on these people here. Previously I used to do it in England, but I gave up. Exhausted all my bank, and how many disciples I get are 7 for 4 years. I said give up these people. Good for nothing useless. All the money they spend.

And what do you find? What's the quality? How many come up and how many work it out? How many care for their self-realization. For me To say that I work very hard, I don't think I work at all. I don't work. I do not work. It emits. It's dead But it's a waste. It's a wasteland.

How are we going to Sow the seed in the wasteland. How are we going to work it out? Especially London seems to be a rock, rock of Gibraltar has come in London, I think. For this place Wimbledon, you'll be surprised. We are very fond of tennis, so both of us used to come. And our driver would say, we must go one hour early. Why? You just can't get in there. And we used to come one hour earlier to get into the lanes of these Wimbledan to go and see the tennis. And the same Wimbledon has 20 people, new people over here.

I really wanted to go back. Because I felt what sort of a quality is this that I'm wasting my time. We tried everything, diplomatic relationship, food, we invited them, give them food, uh, tea, Indian tea, all kinds of things we tried. That a mother should try her level best. You don't understand this. Of course, the Indians who are here are all uprooted people. I don't call them Indians at all. Most of them. That just uprooted people. They don't understand the value of their life, no.

Most of them Of course, there are some sensible people also, no doubt. very few So now what are we to do supposing there is something great that has to happen to this world. And that you are the ones who have to be blessed. Can you believe it? I've been here for 12 years now. It will be the 12th year. But There's a guru who wants a Rolls-Royce. He's already got 58, he wants a 59. There are 60,000 people here who are buying a Rolls-Royce for that person. What happens to your brains I can't understand.

Is that the spirit? Is that what you are seeking? Understatement, I understand, but undervaluing I don't understand. No value for your own being, not for your own. Evolution and for your own. Personality. I tell you I've done everything under the sun. In this country, in India I've hardly worked for 2 years, and we have thousands and thousands of people who are surists there. Our country is going to change very fast, I know that. It will work out even In so many other countries.

But England William Blake, I don't know. He dreamt so great about England because he knew the quality of England that Jerusalem. Do you think You still hope what he said. You have such an advantage of your language. You have such an advantage. That you can read about so many things. Most of the books of philosophy are translated into your language. You're especially being blessed. By so much of knowledge. Despite that, why, why people are So much Unaware of their worth.

Of their deserving capacity. What do they deserve? Let's see I The expectation of the disasters that are going to come or horrible things that are going to happen in this world, all these things, do we deserve or do we deserve some sort of a great hope for ourselves? And everything is within you. You can see that it's all there. It's your own. Why shouldn't you have it? I mean we've tried everything. To push you down to that point every way, every method as in Sanskrit they say kamane the 5 things we have tried. To work it out So now only another thing is to push people with pistons up there and keep them waiting.

That also perhaps you've done, isn't it? The whole world is looking at you, remember that. Not big talking, not big saying. But the big thing happening with you. Is actualization of that great thing. Which is so simple. So beautiful. It takes hardly anything. For you to become your spirit. But to maintain it, to respect it, and to be there.

I don't know what sort of a special glue we should have. They just don't stick on. They meet me on the shop, Mother. I said, how? Oh, you don't know. I came to it 12 years back. You gave me a realisation. All right, now what are you doing about it? Mother, I lost it, you know. Really?

It's very common, very common phenomenon. So those who are here today, 20 people I hope are special. And they consider this experience as something special. and establish themselves. As great saints. Knowing everything about their own powers. It's all has to be free. You cannot pay for it. I'm really frustrated. I must.

I was going away this time to India, I would have been there. But as you say, one is more concerned about the lost lambs. India is very easy. So I'm stuck back. I hope you are not going to disappoint me, those who have come for the first time. Please record hasti his tricks. Everybody tries. But I don't know how to make people stick. A surprising In the West, people have developed the best quality glues. We cannot develop such in India or any developing countries don't have glues.

But as far as they are concerned, they cannot stick on to anything whatsoever. They cannot stick onto their wives. They cannot stick on to their husbands. They cannot stick on to their houses. They cannot stick on to anything whatsoever. What has to grow has to stick on somewhere. If you have to make a bell. Then you find some bottle, then you dig it down. Then you dig one, then another, then another, then go about. That's not the way.

There has to be that breaking into the debt that you are. There has to be that. Happening where you break into your own depth, your own quality, your own wealth. But that time You don't give You don't give to yourself. You have no time for yourself. You have time for all kinds of nonsensical things, but no time for yourself to see what beauty lies, what glory lies behind this. Body About this mind. And below these emotions. I do not know Any other method is possible now. I must say I give up.

I've tried everything. And as you have heard about Sir Yoga, it's a fact. There's no doubt about it. There's nothing to lose. You are the spirit. You have to become the spirit. It must relate to the traditional expression of your revolution. It cannot cut out all the saints. All the great prophets, all the great religious leaders, it cannot go down. But it integrates.

All the essences of these great adventure came on this earth to guide us. It does not cut out anywhere. And that's what he said. Such as you know, it was spontaneous. Now, spontaneous can be quite misrepresented if you use through your brains. Spontaneous means it's a living process. That should happen to all of you, and don't miss the point. You have to spend at least A month to see. The light that you have got. is to be carried much deeper into you.

You are deep. You are great. But if you have to find the pearls that are hidden. You have to go deep down. It's very simple because the more you go. Deeper into yourself, the more you enjoy, the more you become. A wholesome personality. A greater personality. A personality that sees. Everything on a universal level.

And understand everything that is global. I'm sorry today I am not. In my real Proper Mood I should say Because I know how much these people have done. They have advertised. They've gone down. They have put up advertisements everywhere, put up so much money and that what standard time, so what, what was this? Oh God, and that times also times takes so much money out of your pockets. Just think of it. They are like gurus, you see. All that to spend and what do you get out of it.

One feels so sad. It's very sad. Of course, America is so much worse that relatively you don't feel that sad when you think of America. But After describing all the American art today, the gentleman came to the conclusion, and he said, That after seeing all this art. One reaches a conclusion to say that they were barbarians and now they have become worst barbarians. Oh God, I said, what am I to do with these Americans now? But to me you are all my children. You are all mine. I cannot allow you to be drifted away. To the last I'll try to work out.

I know I feel sometimes very desperate and sad. English are very much changed now, they are so much influenced by the French. Now the French are better. But they are influenced by the old French and the old Americans, not the new ones. New ones are very alert. So all the old ideas of these Nonsensical Writers are lingering now in England deposited like in a case of angina in the heart, you see. When there is hardening of the arteries. All the Bad blood. Stagnates like that it's happening. I feel they have given up these ideas.

They have rid of it. They don't want to have. We are still continuing with them. Something respectable for ourselves. That's what I feel. Today most of them, so joke is here, I'm sure you'll all get your realisation in no time. I'm sure of that. But that's not sufficient. Out of the 300 we got in Hampstead with all the work these people did, advertising this, that, whatever was possible. 5 people, some or other.

Stuck on And only 3, I think, with a great glue came down. That should not happen again. So especially for the new people, I have to tell you that this is something so important that has come to be emboldened. All these Tennis players have seen them coming and going. One comes this year, next year he goes away. Somebody is today a topsy, then he goes down. Not in inside. You ascend and ascend and ascend and ascend eternally. It's a very different style of tennis. It's a real plague.

It's no professionals are needed, you become. Such tremendous players. Such a game you develop. And that's what is there for you just to jump into it and to understand. The swimming And I'm sure it will work out. I hope all those who have come for the first time. Will not Treat themselves frivolously. But we'll stand up to it. And give us some encouragement. To work out more in England.

Otherwise, maybe tomorrow all the surgeries from may come to India. With the, how do you say stock what stock lock, lock, stock and barrel lock, stock, and barrel, of course, without the barrels. Uh let's see now how it works out. There's nothing serious about it. You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. This is one thing you should know. A person who is godly is never serious. Inside He's playing the game. So in that playful mood of mulan, let us see what happens. May God bless you.

Any questions? I'll have some water. Some water right there. Thank you. Mhm. No. That seems to be good. Mhm You are free to ask questions. If you have to achieve complete freedom, your freedom is to be respected. Your freedom has to be respected.

It's one question. Yes. Christian and The fundamental But He's a Christian. He does meditation, and he wonders whether he's welcome to our. Very much. But if you are a Christian, please be seated, please be seated. Christian is all right. Any religion is all right. It's all great, but it has talked of the future. Christ has said, I will send you.

A comforter. counsellor and a redeemer. Why don't the Christians look for someone like that? Christ is gone now. He's not here. Why don't they look out for a holy ghost? He himself has said Mohammad said that during the time of resurrection, your hands will speak. What about the Muslims? Why don't they look out for the resurrection? Third is Guruan Kabila.

Nanaka was so great. That he combined all the realised souls who were poets and made a big beautiful runs up. What are the Sikhs doing? They're just reading it, reading it. He says without Knowing yourself, you will be an illusion, he said very clearly. Then should we not look for that? But what happens, I tell you what's the mistake is. Once a religion is organised, it neutralises all your assent. organised. I also took my birth in the Christian religion.

So-called, I would say. Especially that two Protestant. For particular reasons I could have taken birth anywhere else. But now And there is no talk of ascent, no talk of a second birth. Artificially somebody puts his hand on your head. Now you are a Christian. I don't know how you become. Same about Hindus, same about every one of them. They are leading an artificial religion. It's a God Realities within whatever these people have worked and said is not done by them.

It's become a superficial thing. You will not be happy and listen until you find your spirit. How can you organise religion? How can you organise God? Then you think you belong to a church, you belong to a uh. What do you call that a sect or what is it called? Another thing, something denomination. All these denominations brand us. What what's the thing for me? All of them are just the same.

Still groping in the dark, how many are seeking reality? It's not that Christianity has failed, it is the church that has failed. Christ can never fail. Nor can Guruanaka. Nor can Mamaa. What fails is our understanding of them. Let us be the spirit, and then we'll understand them. They are all one hand in hand. No difference at all. They're all one, believe me.

You don't have to give up anything. You have to just see to the essence of it. Supposing a leaf is sick. You cannot teach it at the leaf end. You have to go to the roots. And when you go to the roots you find you have not given up any leaf. You are at the roots and you are at the leaf also everywhere you exist. There are so many seekers lost in this kind of denomination. So many of them. Thank God my parents were real realise suits.

Thank God. Because I found Protestants were. Different types of phonetics, you see, very sophisticated. They would never find out that they are phonetics, so sophisticated, you know, if you make anything very sophisticated, you can't find it out. We can call everybody else a fanatic, but a Protestant you can never call because they are a mental people. They have made it very sophisticated. So if you become so very sophisticated that you cannot see yourself and you cannot Make it out that it's I who's following some sort of a fanaticism, an ideology, a mental projection. How can you get out of it? From every religion, people will think, oh, this is fanaticism. This is too much.

But for this I may be the first, and I hope I'm not the last. Martin Luther himself was a realised soul, no doubt. But At that time, in that short time, with all kinds of Oppressions and pressures. How far could he go? And then There's already an attack built in with Paul. And then with Augustine. What can you do? Any realised soul like Khalil Gibran could see it clearly. So we have to know one thing. We have to love the truth.

Truth is to be discovered through your spirit. And love your truths and not untruths. Any denomination. Is untruth. What is the truth? Is the essence of that. Everything is becoming a plastic. And then we say why people are leaving churches, why people are running up from Christian faith or from that faith. Nothing wrong with Christ. No, it's wrong with us.

That we have made all these plastic things. To cover his image. The greatest justice you can do to Christ is to get your realisation. He was crucified for that. He came for that And he waits for that. So please get your realisation first, and then you will know what is Christ. And how great he is. May God bless you. What else is there? Any other question?

It's a good question because that problem faces every one of you. Let's see. Or there could be denominations like communist, capitalist, East fist, all sorts of things. There could be any time. I don't know the latest. I think last counts after anti-culturists. There's only one. denomination of God is I realised soul a yogi one with God. As the only one. There's no other denomination where all of them combined Christ.

Mom Loud say Socrates Krishna Rama Nanaka Kubira. All of them Combined in that great family of divinity. All right, so should we have realisation? I mean, most of you have had. Is there any question you can ask me? I'll be very happy. Would it be wrong to assume then. getting Was he It would be wrong to assume. Get To what Is it wrong for people who call themselves born again Christians to No, this is the problem is you cannot call yourself. This is a very big problem.

You see, when I went to America, I must tell you. When I started talking about it, they said, you must, what do you say that make it a A registration of my speeches. What is it called? I must have a copyright, see. Of course I'm very bad at human laws. So I said, All right, now what is that for? He said, they will try to copy you. I said let them copy. It's very good. I mean, I'll be very happy.

So then you must have a copyright. Now I said then. What will they do? They said, you see, they will use your words, your centre as a very good idea. But you know what they did? They started calling themselves born again. Born again, you cannot call yourself anything, you see, it's a power, it's a state. It's a situation in which you have to be. If you are just born again, you say to yourself, what is your power? Born again, the first power you get is that you become your nerves become your brain becomes collectively conscious in your awareness.

That's the minimum that should happen. It's not certificate. It's another, oh, that is the latest and the anti-culturist, then they might be the latest. is another denomination. There's no reality that you don't know one of the one of the. They attacked me in Switzerland. And the lady born again was wearing all kinds of glittery things. And she was bringing a Bible to hit me, you know, and I couldn't bear. The whole joke and I started laughing and everybody was very upset, but I was just laughing. I said, What a nice thing, born again coming up to me.

What wrong am I doing to you? But you see, the thing is the organised religion is such a position. It's such a security for people that they say, oh, we are born again, now certified. Certify And they feel very secure with it, I think. Otherwise I can't understand why should you accept such a title you are born again. Unless and until you have the power, we must know what is the power one should have as a born again. They have no knowledge, nothing. They just know Bible, which also is so superficial. There is no depth in their life, nothing. Self-certification There's no certificate in such.

If you are born again, you will know yourself. And then you have to become. It's a becoming that is important. That's a fact. Be careful about born creatures. Oh, we have had enough of them. They felt quite challenged about Siryga because everywhere we went they attacked us everywhere. They tried to attack us, but when we went to Australia, the Australians said, Now you have done enough of yours. You haven't got anything from you, go away. So then they went away.

But they are so self-deceived also. They live with self-deception. They know they haven't got anything. What have you got? Alright, now Gregor has said, I'm this, I'm that, right, don't believe in him. You must get something out of me. Another question. Could you explain the difference between self-realization And Is that the side of me. Just now let us deal with self-realization. That that's why Buddha wanted.

Not to speak a word about God. He never wanted to take the name of God also. He said, first self, he said, don't talk of God, dangerous situation. But in a search yoga, this thing I'll tell you, not here. Because people won't understand when I tell them about chakras, better is to keep this for future, all right? Look at the sa now they want to have God's realisation. That's good. OK What is the purpose of our soul in the material form? Oh, It's a long story Human beings created the purpose. In a way Like a diamond lost in the mire.

You can say Adam and Eve. It started. There would have been no need to go through all this. But human beings wanted to know everything. They wanted to know the sting of a scorpion. They wanted to know. The bite of a snake and then they wanted to come to God. All right, you have your own way. You have freedom. That's freedom.

Nobody can take. That's given to you. Do what you like. So instead of eating your food directly like this, as I said, they started eating. What can you do? That's the Human doing not of God. It could have been very short circuited, but it was so. All right. But that doesn't mean that your body is not required. Everything is required very much.

Because the process is such. Supposing if you have a chance of making a fruit in a seed into a fruit, just in the laboratory, put the seed and it becomes the fruit. All right, then you don't have the whole process, but if the process is this way, you better have it. Next Next time one can try that. But let's finish the process now. We're coming to the end of it. That's the trouble now we can't go back, can we? We are, I mean, trying to. We cannot All right. Is there any other question from Sergi we good?

But don't ask such questions that I can't answer here. Please. Yes, please, again. Huh? Would it be wrong to assume the soul in this life? It Was it? Is it wrong to assume that the soul in this life is the mind in the next life? I didn't follow this. Mind in this life or the next life. Oh, I understand now I.

No, no, no, no, no, no. See, so is different from spirit. Spirit is the light of the soul, right? Let's differentiate it. And then The soul is To tell him All the 5 elements that are within us. They form the soul and the light of the soul. Is the spirit, right? No, no, no, but it doesn't transform from one to another. There's no transformation between this to that, all right. So today's mind becomes a spirit next life as you are saying, how, because today's mind realises that mind is not sufficient.

So it Assets To the spirithood, to the selfhood, all right, through the mind it. Acquires The understanding The logic that you have to accept. But it doesn't come out of your mind. It comes out of the mind of God Almighty, the Spirit. Which is untarnishable. Unchangeable. But by following your mind, you realise that mine is not the last one. Or same with emotions. So many people who have failed in their emotional life in a way are especially blessed because they give up that kind of a madness and achieve spirit. But it's not the same.

It's very detached. It's not attached to any elements. Spirit is detached from all emotions. It can see everything, but it's detached. I followed your question right, isn't it? Yes, thank you. It's a deep question. You understood it. You got your answer right. I, I'm happy.

It's a good question, but it was rather abridged form of a question, but I managed it somehow. Now I'm happy because sometimes, you know. You people are so alert that you ask very nice questions. But I'm not so intelligent, I must confess. As you people are because I don't use my mind at all. Uh, but you can reach. The point very easily. If you have your spirit intact because it's light. Intelligence, if it is pure intelligence, what you call. That's the intelligence of the spirit.

You just reached the point exactly. But the intelligence that we understand is very different, you see, it's, it plays with the words. It baffles you. It's brilliant. The eyes can get completely. Shut with that. Was that pure intelligence. Pure intelligence just Gives you the absolute. essence of everything. That's the intelligence.

Of the spirit, not of the mind. Any other question, please? Hugo, is he there? Any German question? Anyway, we also have denominations are there. Let us be in a very pleasant mood. I'm trying to bring you to a pleasant mood. Please be in a pleasant mood. And now, is there any question? So.

Saga. Because you don't. Yes, madam. I But she's The question between Matahi is your German question which you asked for. How did I know there's a German lurking somewhere. Now explain, what does she say? Why? Why? Because God wanted you to be here. Yeah.

Like you said, there must be a reason, of course. The reason is is the reflection of God's will. That he wanted us to be here. It's not according to our reasoning that God moves. He has his own reasons. That he wanted to have something, so he has it. He wants to have his children. Why do you have a child? Because you want to have. I want to enjoy and cherish.

That's what God wanted to enjoy and cherish the love of his children as the child loves you, you see, the answer is yes. See? He is a realised soul and he's clearing her. Jack So my intelligence is with him. Correct. He's clearly clearing your this chakra. And he understands. But this is the real I saw. We Which just put up your hand. I can't see you.

They're asking for their self-realization. That's great. That's your right. That's very, very great. All right, let's have But all the 20 who are here. I have to make a humble request. That please respect your realisation. Please. Sometimes I weep with frustration. And I request you To understand your value and worth in the light of the spirit.

Thank you. Could you please take out your shoes and sit with your 2 ft on the ground without crossing the legs? And Be comfortable. Don't have anything which makes you feel tired and put. Your two hands in the direction of Srima Taji with the poems upwards. Thank you. But the new people should come forward and the surgeon must give them room because you see we have to look after that. So please all the people who are here for the first time, would you please come forward on the forward seat and every Sajogi on the forward seat, please. The first seat, please move backwards. And we are speaking about the seats, not on the ground, so all the new people, please sit on the first row of seats.

Um That's great. She's going to start a centre in Wimbledon. Let's see. Hope for the best. Keep your fingers crossed. Such vibracious it's better to be there but they go into cramps. Oh, if this is not enough, also on the 2nd row, please, uh, Jayogis, can you leave the 2nd row free? Such vibration boy, you don't know his idea of a builder. Different is vibration. It's too much vibrations.

Yeah, it's good. Sir Jogi should move from the 2nd row and let people who are new should sit there. Please move from the 2nd and the 1st row also, I mean. Please, can you just, as I said, put your 2 ft on the ground straight without crossing the legs and put your two hands with the palm upwards in the direction of Shri Mata. If you are sitting on the ground, there's nothing to worry about the feet being on the ground, then you are on the ground. But those who are sitting on the chair, please put both your feet. Like this on the mother because she sucks in the problems you have. I put both hands like this towards me. Now you have to close your eyes. Just close your eyes.

You don't open your eyes till I tell you to open your eyes, so you just keep your eyes shut. Now left hand is symbolic of our desire. Desire power. So we are putting our desire left hand. Asking For our self-realization, so keep it all the time. The left hand towards me. Right hand is the power of action. Grea So you have to use the right hand for that. And so You have to put your right hand. On to different centres which I will explain to you.

Very in a very simple way. And you'll be able to understand that you have to put your hand on these centres helping your kundalini to rise. Now, We are working out only on the left hand side of our centres with our right hand. So the left hand is towards me. And the right hand goes on to different centres that we have as simple as that. The first one. Is the one What we call is the seat of the spirit, which is the heart, which is on the left hand side. So please put your left hand towards me. All the time and the right hand on the heart. Now just on the heart.

Now at this place. You have to Ask me a very fundamental question. Mother If you call me Shri Mataji, her mother is the same. Mother Am I the spirit? The fundamental question just asked me, Mother, am I the spirit? Ask this question 3 times, Mother, am I the spirit? So One has to know that if you become the spirit, you become your own guide. You become your own guru. This is all created by the great prophets and great gurus within you, the possibility. So now after this you take down your right hand.

Onto your stomach on the left hand side. This is the centre Of a mastery Mastery Of the divine power. The technique how to use it. So here you have to ask another question relevant with the first one. That if I am the spirit, am I my own master? Ask a question now 3 times. Mother, am I my own master? Put your left hand towards me and right hand. On the Left hand side of your stomach in the upper part. In the upper part of your stomach on the left hand side, please put your right hand and press it, and here you ask me a question three times, Mother.

My own master. Am I my own guide? Am I my own guru? This is the blessings of the real. Sadgurus Mm 3 times Now, Please take your hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now press it hard. This is the centre that works out. First one was the master. This is the centre that works out. The divine technique.

Of the true knowledge. Of the pure knowledge. So now ask a question. In a way it's not a question but a request. Because unless and until you ask for it. I cannot do it. I cannot cross your freedom, so here you say. Mother, please may I have the pure knowledge? Mother, may I have the pure knowledge? Say it 3 times.

Mother, may I have the pure knowledge? 6 times Because this centre has got 6 petals. Now this you are asking. To initiate the kundalini. To awaken the kundalini when you ask for it because it's such an absolute question, the Kundalini awakens. You have to request her. No Again, raise your hand. To the upper portion. Or upper area of the stomach. On the left hand side.

At the centre of the mastery. Here you press it hard. And say With full confidence for the Kundalini to rise. To open the centre with full assertion. Mother, I am my own master. Mother, I am my own master. You have to say this 10 times. Because there are 10 masters within us who have built up over 10 centres of plexuses. Of this solar taxis. So we have to say 10 times with full assertion, Mother, I am my own master.

Now there. Your right hand on To the heart Here again with full confidence within yourself forgetting all your past. Forgetting all your problems. It's full confidence and assertion you have to say. Mother, I am the spirit. You have to say it 12 times. Mother, I am the spirit. You are the spirit, no doubt about it. Believe in yourself. Have faith in yourself.

Know that you are the spirit and nothing else. Now, Raise your right hand. In the corner of your left. Shoulder and your neck. From the front This is the Most difficult centre that we have in the West. Because people believe in something called the guilt. And all the time they feel guilty for nothing at all. So put it in the corner. Of the neck And the shoulder press it hard on the back bone. Hard This is the worst centre we have in the West that we feel guilty for nothing at all.

What is a feeling guilty. You are the spirit. How can spirit make mistakes and God? Is the ocean of love and compassion, but above all, He's the ocean of forgiveness. What guilt can you have? What mistakes can you commit that is power of forgiveness cannot forgive? You are not to be guilty. Forget my lecture. Forget everything you are. The fuel Immaculate spirit.

You are Schan. You are the source of all that is joy. But You have to say this 16 times, Mother, I am not guilty. 16 times, press it hard and say it 16 times. Hm. So in the beginning it was terrible. Now, Take his hand. Put it across your forehead, please. Stretch your left hand towards me at this point. Not how many times?

But from your heart you have to say. Mother, I forgive everyone. Something that's very difficult to forgive. We submit Because whether you forgive or not forgive, you don't do anything about it. But if you don't forgive, then you play into the wrong hands. So please say, mother, I forgive. That's the greatest weapon you have, mother, I forgave. Everyone First of all, yourself. Now on the back of your head. Hold it tight Now for your own consolation you can say that.

Oh God Almighty. Or my Kundalini, the mother. If I have done anything wrong. In your glory, in your name, please forgive me. Not to feel guilty at all. Please don't feel guilty, but just say it out. Don't count. All your so-called sins, just forget it, forget it, forget it. Mm, love it. Now Raise your hand on top of your head.

On the fontanel bone area. Stretch your palm and press it hard in a clockwise manner. Take your right hand on top of your head, on the fontanel bone area. Which was a soft bone in your childhood. Press it hard And Here in a clockwise manner when you move it, you have to say something. Which I cannot. Do it without it because you are free. So you have to say, Mother, I want my realisation. I cannot force on you. So to say I want my realisation, brother, please give me my self-realization.

Just say that, press it hard, press it hard. Stretch your palm on top of Font Nimbo area now 7 times. Now bring down your right hand, please. The most valuable moment of your life. And the most Precious Important Happily Now please press your right hand towards me and left hand on top of your head bending the head about say 34 inches and move the hand and see if there's any cool breeze coming out of your own head, please. It was really nice to have this seminar organised here at such a short notice. With no proper Planning or anything. And you've got such a nice place also spontaneously the whole thing has worked out. And everything is vanished. But Today you saw the new people who came.

Well An example Of The dearth of seeking in this country or maybe There is some sort of Of lacking on the part of English is also. The way that Because I'm here People take things for granted. Or maybe that a few like Gavind and others are very anxious. Trying to do their level best. To do this And I think on two points might be we are failing. One point is That we all must know what have we done for surgery. Some people take 2 or 3. Posters and post them, then they think they've done everything. No. You have to do much more than anywhere else because you are placed in This important thing called The heart Everybody has had an advantage of Sajo has been helped a lot.

We have to think what have we done for. It has done so much for us. What have we done for such? That's very important. So then there should be I think I was expressing that anxiety which The people who are Your leaders and those who are worried about Serva in England. And my lecture, the whole lecture has that. Tremendous concern. And then we have to think, what have we done? We have houses, we have places, we have ashrams, we have families, we have wives, we have everything. And the surga still, if it is by the way.

Then this is the result. You get 20 nonsensical arrogant people. Don't get realisation some of them get it and get out. So I think this is on one side is this that what have we done for such. It should be in other countries I'm not there, so for them when I go there, they went for 4 or 5 days. The whole place is filled with my, the whole place is filled with my posters, the whole place. It has to be done every time I speak. The whole of London should have been today filled with my posters. I mean, anybody who goes to say, Switzerland or to Rome or to Paris, they tell me Indians that we saw your posters all over the place, but never has happened in London. Now I hope this is not the last programme, public programme in England.

But still one has to work very hard. All of you should think what you can do. Because everybody has taken things. In their own style, like the leaders are worried. They are working hard. They're all trying to do things. And arrange things, all that. But what have you done is the point. Now some people have had failures, say for example, some people had failures with the officials and with the government or with the TV. It doesn't matter.

We know we have failed it, but advertising, postering, talking about it, going around it. All that can be done. There's one part is very good in this respect is that outside London, things are working out better. But how many of you have been doing that? Very few. The same party goes here. The same party has to do it all the time. No Now this is one side of the picture is that that the advertising and all that has to be done more intensely extensively. And everybody must offer their full support and services. On the seminars side, we are all very good.

Everything is done well, I agree. So many things are because we have to do so many things together, but still. You're being the heart, you have to be you have to be like that. What can you do? That's one part of it. The second part of it I feel is like we had in Hampstead about 300 people. And they came And What I've learned is that when they came to the programme. Nobody was sort of openhearted, sort of talked to them in that way as they should have. Some of you did, but not all. Most of you are just sitting down.

Like if they come to my house, they'll just sit down like this. You cannot You cannot just do that. It's not done. Come to my house. Sit down like this. Always they will come and sit down and put hands. You can't do that. That shows you are very insular. Very selfish. And also in a way arrogant.

You cannot take my vibrations without my permission, can you? So this is suggestive of one thing that what we do is to take things for granted. And we, when we talk to others also, it takes time for an Englishman to get up. That's the thing is. Now the, the quality of this is this that in English do not want to interfere with anyone. They want to leave them alone. It's not a bad thing. They want that why should we interfere? I agree. That's the point.

But that's not the point now. We have to aggress. This is the thing I'm bringing you to. That means you don't mean that, but what you mean is that not to interfere. See, they don't discuss religion in England. No, you're not supposed to say these things. You are not to discuss whether you are a miss or a missus. You are not to say whether you have children or not. If you ask somebody a question, have you got children? That means the most offensive thing.

You are not to discuss anybody's family. There are so many don'ts in this country so that we do not also sort of get up worried that maybe this may be taken as an interference. But just opposite are Americans. They will go up to the great grandfather and up to the whole progeny to find out. So interference should be forgotten. There should be no fear about them. But open your heart and talk to them openly with an open heart. But people recede back. Once they receipt back, others also somehow get frightened because they think you are just like them. You have to be different.

Good. So amongst English joists there are some who are very anxious, very Much worried that being so much working it out. Some of them are really indifferent. And the middle part is those who are still trying to see how far to go, how far not to go, you have to be aggressive about it. I mean, as if now I feel the English have aggressed so much. That now they are so fed up with aggressiveness. That's the thing I want you to have today, to be aggressive. Aggressiveness is the only way you can reach these people, otherwise they won't understand. And you have to talk to them on their faces. I've seen how people talk.

If you talk to them like that, they are all right. Unless and until you work out that way when the people come, you talk to them in an aggressively loving manner. Do you understand that? Exuberance Just open out your heart. How, come down, come down. Where are you going? Sit down. What do you want? You want? One minute this one will look like this, you see.

Second minute You must understand your own character that exists in those people also. The language starts, I'm afraid. So aggressively compassionate, aggressively loving, aggressively openhearted. Non-interference and all those ideas are out of date now finished. Now openness. No arrogance No anger but openness. Aggressive innocent people like children are. Children are so aggressively innocent that you like it. I mean, if they catch hold of you, they'll all come and jump on your body and sleep on top of you. Kissing you all over.

That's how. You have to be aggressively loving and aggressively good. What do you want, you want something to eat. You want this, that, that. They'll be surprised how these English people have become like this. So on these two things we fail. And this anguish and this anxiety that I have is is one of the expressions of the modern times as known. of the modern times because modern times are so funny. That if you click it, you click it, and if you don't click it, it's so important, so precarious is the word, so precarious at this time if you don't click it, it's finished. So I find everyone.

is capable of doing lots of things for surgery. But what have we done for surgery? Nice in the seminar to come and enjoy. It's a good idea. Enjoy Sa Jogi's mother is collecting them. One of the examples is that from the Other countries people come. They are sick. There are problems this that. Immediately the telephone will ring me up saying, Mother, somebody has come with 10 boots and 15 boots. So what.

When should that person see you? I said, the person or the boots? And the booths only come. The person is busy. At least you can reduce some numbers. And then send such a person. Now I've started using the hearth of my house instead of the candle. Now, will you please Look after the boots of the people. And they come And among you are there are many like that. Your children are caught up.

Some of the wives are caught up. Some of the husbands are caught up. But nobody pays attention. Carrying on with that. Sometimes even support it. And just I see them even staying in ashrams, I must say some of them are really botish and troublesome. And you think that you have to tolerate there's no crucifixion needed anymore. If somebody has a book, better tell that person you're catching. I mean, I don't want to tell, but you know what happens to me. My hands and my feet, they all go crazy.

And there's a boot button, so I just don't know it. In the same way, it should happen to you, and you should try to correct that person, but nobody bothers, you see, because you think correction will be too much. Oh, maybe he might feel hurt and he run away. Let him run away. Take 2 running jumps and go to hell. But the whole thing should be a concern and anxiety and loving way. Then you will attract that person. I mean today I was really so full of vibrations. Nothing would be sucked in. These horrible 20 people are also they were, they were stopping you also from sucking me.

I mean they were more powerful than you are in your suction, I think. So now there's something wrong with us. What is that wrong is what have we done for Sir Juga? First question. Second is, what am I doing about myself? Where am I? Nice to ask the question. What's the difference between a God realised and a self-reliance? God realised never catches. Just knows.

Now why do I feel horrible? Only with surgeries, no with non-surgeries. Even when Naakasura comes before me, I can kill him. But surgeries are inside my body. What am I to do? They are part and parcel of me. They are not foreigners. So when they get sick, I get sick myself because they are inside myself. No deity has done that. No incarnation has done that job.

Nobody has injected Sajogi inside their body. Has anyone done that way? You're all inside my body, part and parcel. When something goes wrong with you, it goes wrong with me inside, naturally, if I take, it's indiscriminate you can say, but if I were not indiscriminate, how many would have gone inside my body? That's how I can cleanse you. I can look after you. I can know about to work out things very well. Something happens to someone in Australia, I can work it out here because he's in my body. That's why I get. I can say I get caught up Because I've got boots within me.

So you must keep out your boots. This is the 3rd point, very important. How can I have boots in me? How can I have? Left side or right side or anything. I am in the body of mother. Was that What a privilege. What an honour. So now I can't have any boots within myself. It has to be something very pure.

So try to purify us. Keep yourself. What I'm saying now is for English, is for all of you. English being always the leaders for starting something good, I have to talk to them more. They've done it because they were the ones who fought the war, won it, and that's how we started under the tides. But now the instruments. That we are going to use have to be that powerful. If Europeans Among them say Brussels people come up very well. Then I'll shift my attention. We can shift hard these days.

Transplant is possible. Hm. Have you heard of heart from the right move to the left? Or left to the right. God can do it. There are people born with a heart on the right hand side also. So To be very precise, I think that this seminar should be used. For also having an inner in inside. See What have we done for surgery? That will help.

Secondly, Very important is, are we openhearted? Now for example, We can say like this. That's for the I'm in the house and the bell rings up. If there's an American, I'll I'll get it. He'll be the first to run. And English would be looking this side, that side. Because it's kind of a lethargic. That is. Because that's the idea of the negative to freeze the heart. And that freezing is to be avoided.

I'll get it. I'll do it. I'll work it out I have to do it That must be told. All the English jugs must know that they have to be the most active people, do you know, even when we sleep and the heart is beating all the time till we exist. So I have to tell you that you bear a very big responsibility to surgery. That's why I've been here. I've been with you, and that doesn't mean you should take things for granted. You can do a lot. You have to circulate. Maybe English surgeries will have to travel a lot.

But first of all, first and foremost, open your heart. Openly and sweetly. You have children, learn from them, how they talk, how sweetly they move. Really open your heart. Unless and until you open your heart, how can you do anything for anybody else? And that's what one has to achieve. I'm sure Next programme. I can see myself all over London. All right. Hello.

Now don't feel guilty. I'm getting terrible pain. Don't feel guilty. Face it, yes, it's true. Don't feel guilty about it, for heaven's sake, don't feel guilty because I'm now getting a terrible pain again. Hm. Put this The food has arrived, are they? So We can have some music, all right, then I'll go because tomorrow I have to come for your pooja. So if you don't mind tomorrow about 11 o'clock we'll start the pooja, but those who have to cancel that thing, I hope you manage that tomorrow. I bless you with that.

We got this. has just said lunch is absolutely fixed at this place at 12:15, they won't move. 150. We can start at 10 o'clock. We can start food at 10. I mean, for me it's all right. I can even start at 9. But what about you people? Well, I can start at 66. What just now?

I mean, it's not that we could have it after lunch it'd be better. But what about others? No, it's better to have it before. No, it's, you see, actually, it's this, there is, I don't know what sort of uja it is going to be because see it's a Vishnu Mayas, uh, this thing, you see, so we can have a short puja Vishnu Maya so. It has to be done in the night, no doubt, in the sense that It doesn't matter. It's no difference. It's uh you can call it a global puja, some sort of thing. General we can call it, I don't know. Which to my eye is something so powerful. All right, so let's have some music and then I'll go back.

Just tell her not to wait for my food. I It's good. If that she should eat up. So let's see now, what is the contribution. Now you have seen the music that has come from Nasi. What a professional music it was. Did you hear that? Now what are we to produce? Just look at that. It was a real professional thing they have done.

So we should try to find out something better, all right, now let's have some music. Well, what do you think so? All right, all right, all right. What is cooked in this one and this one, yeah, plain plain, plain one I like. And that I can, all right, all right, I'll try to manage something. Now let's have some music. I'm. Now for India too. You see, this may be there, as I told you. I don't know this year or maybe next year, maybe the last year, I can't say.

The reason is once we have established our ashrams in India. I don't think I'll be able to take all this. Around all the villages and all that, once we have ashrams, they will all come down to see us there. In India, for them it's a pilgrimage. And they go out of the way to do it. So when you people are coming there after once we have established our ashram. There won't be any of these India toos much. Which you have enjoyed very well. Maybe this might be the last year or next year. I don't know.

It depends on as soon as we establish Tash. Now, I see that People Do not understand the value of Indian to also. It does a lot of good to you because it's a country which is heavenly, I should say, as far as vibrations are concerned. Sometimes I feel we are living in hell here because I see the TV and horrible things and I mean it's really terrible. There are so many Indians who have come here and they say that they lose their vibrations, not only here, America anywhere. So the Indian tour, though apart from anything else itself, is visiting India is still a clearer country, especially Maharashtra. No. It's time to make it convenient. We have made it for 3 weeks. So you're there only for 3 weeks, 2 weeks?

Around at one week around the sea, sure. No, actually we will not have many. Public programmes. But that is something every year. If you cannot do it, at least alternate years should have been done. Well, I find that That people don't understand the importance of Indian. 99% of people who have been to India settled down in search. There must be something about it. So those who are going to, and now we have made it the minimum possible though everybody warned us, Warren said that it's going to be very expensive, it is 10 times more. Everything is there.

What minimum we have put it. Luckily, also Air India, because it had so many accidents, it has gone very cheap. And you people should know that if you have to go pay the money in time, you're still waiting for the last minute. I'm going to be here for a month. I know that. But that doesn't mean that you should take so much time. It's like a pilgrimage. And everybody should try. Everybody should try. I cannot manage many, but quite a lot we can manage now because we have made two tools now.

In case you cannot manage the first two, you come for the 2nd. But it's not so difficult, but if you see, I've now noticed people. Quite closely that people waste their money a lot. Just the other way around Indians. You know they keep all the money just. For my tour there. Keep all their holidays, all their money for the tour, though they do not gain so much as you people gain. Because it's a new world, you go to. So those who are coming, Should decide, but those who are not coming also must think it out. It's not difficult.

It's better. I hope this is not the last time, but maybe I can't say because once we have an ashram, then why we not go all over the Indians will all come from all over India. They'll come. People are already coming from Madras, even if I have a small little room, they come down. Because we have no place to make them stay, that's fine. Otherwise you will be surprised they will be all there. You won't be able to see yourself. You'll be so. Before that starts, you must understand that you have to go to India some or other. At least once.

Next year or this year you have. But I can't even promise next year. I really tell you. I must say that 90% next year we'll have the programme, because it's becoming very difficult, very difficult money wise also. And otherwise it's becoming sunwieldy. So I would request you to think it over, and those who want to come should give your names. Even if you have not paid the money, can do it because I'm here for this month. So those who have not yet given your names also can give your names to come in and will adjust it. But I cannot make it, I mean. I wanted to make it much cheaper for you, but it's not the food that is expensive with the travelling, but now travelling has become much cheaper.

But everything is by the way, that's the trouble is. By the way, You see, if you want to save money, and people will save money to buy a Rolls-Royce, which cost, I don't know how much for that horrible fellow in one year. And such can't have money to go to India. I believe it. At least once everybody should go watch it. Because it hurts. Hs them such a lot. I myself never knew that it would help so much, but I now believe it does help. So those who have not yet given money also can give their names to the. Or to their leaders.

We'll be saving, staying for 7 days on the seashore, and beautiful, one of the best in the whole world. Well Ganesha is there. And the water of the She comes out of his nay. I only his lower body you can see the head is the mountain itself. You can see the lights coming out of it. Only the surgeons can see. I don't know, but next year also. But it should not be a thing that is. I sort of uh, by the way. That's important.

So let's just see what's happening because Australians have quite a lot coming. And we have to see about others also. Right. May God bless you. Well that sounds nice. Now look at the music they produced, the quality. Try to compete with them. There's No. Just think of it, and I know. He got his election only last year, last year.

Last year this fellow got his real Irish. In one year, We have made copies of that music for you people to be given you as presents only to the leaders. Oh Yeah. Um Is And drums. That would be a good idea. I do. No, no It's about 50. We're working on it. Use tabla for this. Don't you know tabla, any one of you?

You must learn at key. It's very simple. I was a drum. We don't have any drummer. Do you have any drama among you? All right, it's all right. Have you got? You better get it not here but. You should because what is wrong is the heartbeat of the sad. The spirit without a drum, you see that lacking is there.

It doesn't matter we or you can makes no difference. So you'll get it next time. Oh Yeah Oh A I Were. Our lives do. I Oh. um Uh I we enjoy. I Uh. I The. I made my. I Uh, first screw.

Kaka. Um I Uh. I Uh Uh But Ah. Yeah. OK. I like rapes. And then they come to the shore. Then the short reacts and then the 2 waves and 4 waves and 10 wings. It's beautiful, isn't it. Thank you.

I I Oh. Oh Beautiful, very nice. But you see, some of the words I cannot catch. I can feel the vibrations. We should have more books, I think. Or they disappear, I think. See, the books should be collected back. That's the best way and should be carried again for the seminars. That would be better. Huh?

It's all right. If you want, I would love to hear. It's a very good one. You should take a fast number. I Chris, you have sent me some very beautiful poems. Have you brought them with you? From Bristol? Let me see. Yeah. What's he say?

Uh, where is Chris? You sent me You know, I told them it was Chris Wakefield who wrote, but they said, no, Chris Wakefield is not a writer. Another Chris is a writer, but I tell you there's a poet. Poets are not writers. That's the trouble. Yeah I'm glad to Very much, but what about them? Where are they? I have You haven't brought. Oh, I'll bring them tomorrow, I think. Beautiful, but he's a real poet, real poet C poetry is so great.

You see, now I'll tell you one thing about poetry. In the poetry, poetry means there has to be magic in the world. Uh When you say something, it must have a magic. If there's no magic, then it's not poetry. Then the second thing is That It's precise. It has to be precise. It has to be Small one sentences like many propositions and all that are to be dropped off. Adjectives to be dropped and you are allowed. So many Adverbs can be dropped out. But mainly what you can drop out are articles, absolutely.

Third is that it must have Russia. Rasa means the essences. It must have the essence. And the essences are according to Indian science are 9 times. Must have an essence. Now this is the essence today is of Bhakti. When you are singing of Bhakti and devotion. Then you have to use. Words extremely gentle words, gentle words. A beautiful words.

Words that are delicate. The words that express. devotion Through humility. Words of humili. Now what I see now with your compositions. The two types one. is addressed to others. I Addressed to Mm In the others you have addressed some to the other people who are not iris. Some your own surgies together. And some are addressed to me.

So there are 3 types of compositions you. Now when you are addressing to others. It need not be that delicate. And it is a, come and see, listen. Look This is what you should do. In a gentle way they don't understand. So you have to use words which are sort of forcing them, pushing into it. What are you doing? This is the poem same way written down and a very good poem, no doubt, but in this poem, whatever you have written this one. It's good, nice, and everything fine, but what I find is still a little bit diplomacy.

Now if you say how many of you want to be saved today, let's say all of us. How do you count? How do Find out So the question should be. As Oh really? In totality, Actually, honestly, put these adjectives in between so that then people understand, honestly, are we honest? But they'll also be we all want to see. We are all seekers. You are seekers, we are seekers. Why should we run after. All right, so honestly.

And all those things sort of see, make it look more. Objective To fix them, you have to hem them up, otherwise they'll slip up in whatever you're seeing, it should be such that they are. Pushed into a point, they have no escapes left. So when you write down next time, it's very good poetry, no doubt, but correct it when you address to others, see that they have no escape. That they cannot budge up, all right. You are a scholar, so I must ask your permission. Now, the second one is when we are singing among ourselves. Now the thing that is joy, joy is a very good one. But We are not addressing to folk people. That's the point.

We are adjusting to intellectuals. So that's a good one between ourselves when we sing. We have to adjust to the intellectuals so we can challenge relatives. So what have they got with the intellect, what did I get? If they say, what did I get? All these barren things, useless things, saw nothing, not a single fred. And then come down. What I got in search of. This relative. Description should be given, so I hope some of you will write poetry on that.

The third one is what Wakefield has done. Is my description. And devotion to It's come out very well, I must say. I think that's the highest one can do. As the best, but still we need all this. We have to have. Otherwise we cannot manage, so that's a part of it, but the essence of it, the praise. Where Many great poets, many great writers. Many great saints and incarnations have aspired to sing the praise of the mother. It's a great aspiration.

Like Markande I did that. Today also we did it after 14,000 years, then. Adi Shankarach did that. poetry of that level should come on. I would request you to read those poems, poetry of those people who compose such high class books that not a word can be changed, not to be added, and that's how you try to perfect it. Try to perfect it. When you have written it down, sit down, think over it again, try to bring in better words. Try to put better words, so you actually make it a perfect poetry, a perfect setting. That's it. But a poet is a poet born poet.

It's a thing that is born, and even after so many people suddenly become poets like Dhamla never used to, he's an engineer, never used to write, but wrote very well. Very beautiful. His poems are very good, even now I think he's very good, but there was another fellow of Kade who did beautiful writing. I don't know where are his poems last, but they are somewhere. And such tremendous things he has written. I was amazed, but he said, I don't write. Saraswati is writing. So for that, you see, The spontaneity is alright, but you have to have the technique to write. The technique must be there and the spontaneity I look after it. So you have to also develop a little bit of technique how to write it down in these three categories you write of different.

So when you write about your mother, You have to be absolutely sure. Absolutely one. And absolutely surrendered. So the whole thing can be an epic, absolutely. The topmost thing that one can do in poetry is to write the places of the. That's the highest. So all the poetry is very nice, comes out of very generous heart and also. Very great hearts, but it has to have a technique. And the technique is to be a little bit understood in a divine way. That what makes it Uh thing that throbs in your heart.

So that you will see yourself that will throbbing around. If you are detached about it, you will do it, and you do it very well. I was so happy about Chris. I told them it was Chris Wakefield who has written to me. They thought that it is Chris who has done this from Bristol, so I said, all right, let me ask first of all Chris from Bristol. Beautiful, beautifully done. All right. So, best of luck to you for all these good poems and poetry that you have done, and all these pieces are extremely beautiful. But we have to perfect it, make it better and better. I In tune with divine vibrations.

So you should say vibrations also. What gives you the best vibration? Tunes could be simple, could be complicated, could be magical, could be anything, but the poetry must. Not narrate But create magic. Sanskriti said when there's Jama car and there's a magic. Ja The light of the magic. When there is a light of the magic, then you should call it the poet Ras Makawe. When there is Rasad, then there is Kawe. There is otherwise no. Without ras there is no.

Now this is the part where the composer is concerned now for the part of the ones who have to sing. To sing from your heart. Knowing before whom you are seen from your. You're not singing for yourself, you're singing for me, singing for the whole universe. Say from your heart knowing that I'm before you, understanding. Secondly, you must have the technique of singing it. It's very important. All these techniques are built in through tradition by understanding whatever is not. Proper is thrown away. It should not be that one line close long, another line comes short long.

Should be, there should be a proper technique about it, how to do it. See, like a free verse business is no good for surgery. So that technique you have to know how to sing it without the music, but the drum is an essential part of every music because that is the part where Ahata is playing. So in sound, drum has to be when you are singing, there has to be drum as well as other accompaniments, any accompaniments you have, but drum is an essential part that has to be there. And the whole thing should be on a rhythmic understanding that you see, you have seen how Indians have rhythmic understanding, you see, they cut it into 3 halves, 4 halves, they bring it back and how they cut it, how they go off. It's really too much, but you can compose. To a great extent on those lines. And That technique has to come properly understood. Like singing in parts itself it's a big technique, and one has to understand how you do it, but there are so many other things which you have is stremor, you have yodelling. I don't know if you use those things or not at all, but you should use in music.

There are so many things you have all of these things you should use, which helps a lot in music. I don't know much about Western music, but. And these things, if you use, it will help a lot to bring out the music in its proper way, and I don't know if you have any soprano singers also. And the way they sing beautifully, you have to have some of them. So in between a soprano singer can sing in between, but should be made a proper sensible. organised thing because to the public. Uh, they can't understand this. And another could be hippie style of music. I don't mind even that. It's all right, but if it is sung with the heart, with that devotion, like a folklore, would be very good, but should be so fast and so accurate and so clear cut that people should feel this is something so great.

So you can have all varieties, you can have classical style, and you can have this yodelling style. Yeah And then you can have many styles you can sing like that. OK, we do have like for the tapes you have heard now is we have two tapes which are absolutely folk. I don't know if you have noticed it's a very fast number. The first one is, and the first one is about how the abstract without form, the formless has become, has appeared now into form. The first one, it's such a fast number. So I hope you have heard it. Have you heard it clearly? I would like to hear once again. Just play the first one.

Nirguni Nirguni is without any. So now when you see, hear that, try to grasp it. I think in music. Indians are very well off, no doubt about it. I mean, no doubt about it. They're very well off and the rhythms and all that, they're very systematic. They know a lot. So it's a very good thing, but now you listen to the first one. The one you had just now out of that, the first one. Now you see the whole thing out there was, the rhythm.

The music, the poetry, and the combination of everyone, how they worked it out. Just see this point for about 2 or 3 minutes it will play. And it's a folklore. It's a folk thing. It's an extremely fast. A fast music, folklore, absolutely what you can call the top speed, it starts. So they said Nirguni, the one who who was without any gunnas, without any form, has appeared now on the scene to give us realisation. It's such a speed, but it conveys and communicates the thing. Just after when they have said that this is the thing. Only listen to one and you just put a little forward.

So A little forward than this. But that's OK. You started it. No, no, not this one, the other way. It's on the other side. On the other side That's a folklore, just an ordinary. Now you also catch hold of your folklores here. It must be very fast, I'm sure. Get hold of your folklores and their tunes and set into that. That's the best way to do it. They can be very fast.

This is just a folklore and a folk style called lani. And that it is best, it's very fast. This is the first one. In this one, the first. Now just listen to it. And you will understand what I'm saying. That's an example I feel. And this poetry is very high class, very high class poetry. The style is folk. It's the first one and then you stop it.

That's all. You see that the one you brought is no good compared to what he was really. Then that's nothing, nothing compared to that that day he was in a different mood I think. A little louder I I I I I. That's I I from. We ask for yoga from How fast it Politicians can understand. the dualism. I land is too tight. And what will I have is the that Enlightened awareness. It's a it's a colloquial.

It's a village on globe. I'll ask her for yoga. Now go change the toy. 99 nights I will spend in her heart. OK. My father-in-law, he's there. He's the vanity. I'll give him up. Oh It's a woman's song. She says my father-in-law is the vanity and my husband is the ego. I'll give them up.

What is it? is the enlightened awareness. I'll make my flowers of that. Gina. I And that's how I'll kill the Mahara. All all those which are bad conditioning me, I'll take them as bad eyes from my mother. Yeah. What was supposed to. I become unattached to everything. I've left my husband.

I Lust and anger. That my relations have left them behind. Oh. I I asked the mother for her yoga and I've bought it and kept it with me. I Then I have gave her back by spreading it all over. I got rid of a life and death cycle by giving all that back. The village style is absolutely. It's a very, very A fast song with very deep, uh, penetrating poetry, very penetrating. And this is how one should understand that there has to be yoga words. There has to be yoga ideas.

There has to be all these things. Otherwise we have not achieved it. Even his songs are like that. Like he says Aga chakra on the Agachakra I've got, uh, a bundle, bundle of love. So why have you stopped now open it my sister. Oh mother, open my so. Let's talk of these things in our poetry. In English language you must talk of these things in this way. I was happy in the previous one you talked of Sara and all that. Let people know that you know more than them and that you have a deeper understanding of everything.

That's how it should be brought in. So we have had very nice music. Thank you very much. Tomorrow again, we are going to have the music of the Puja. So may God bless you. Hope to see you again tomorrow morning, all right? that recording when you were there because I know that I know I've found the address of the company which does the recording and I'll ask them to give us a copy to sell us a copy of the, yes, they will sell us. It's not very expensive that the one, the one that we were in. It wasn't as good. I thought it was very good though.

I mean, the, I've got it, yeah. There's another one. You've got not, he's, he's a bond, he's a bond realised. He's done some, he's a Muslim, but, uh, his recording is not good. Another one is good. Just play a little bit. Something is good in there. Yes, please be seated 5 minutes more. Then he's going to get the proper report. Music is very important in these modern times, and one has to concentrate on that, but the poetry has to be penetrating.
