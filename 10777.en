Dhule (India)
Talk Language: Marathi | Translation (Marathi to English) - VERIFIED

A woman called Rājkunwar Rāul (Sahaja Yogi) is in Dhule. This is the great fortune of Dhule. I came here because of the charm of her love. I told her I would come to Dhule once. And I am becoming aware of how much devotion and love there is in this place.

In our country, everyone has written a lot about religion since ancient times and there have been a lot of discussions. Even in temples, bells are ringing now, people also go to churches, go to mosques, a lot of work has been done in our country in the name of religion. But the real work doesn’t seem to have happened anywhere. We go to the temple, we do everything properly, we do everything for the Pooja (worship), we come home, but even then we don’t feel that we have got anything. The inner peace, inner love, inner joy, is never found. No matter how much we do, we do not feel that we are close to God. We also don’t feel we have got this Māuli (Mother), on whose lap we can rest our head and say freely that we don’t want to do anything now. 

I am not saying that a person should not go to the temple. We should go. We must go but to identify the honey, we must know the flowers first. So they created the embodiment of God, which is to say they named the flowers. From Vishnu to Shiva (Hindu Gods), as well as from Muslims to Ali to Wali (Muslim saints), from Christians to Christ to his mother, everyone has a genealogy. The names are all known. Even after knowing the names of the flowers, the honey was not found! We worship Sākār (physical form of God), take the name of Vishnu. See, in Sage Vyasa’s description too, he has said – you may have heard the verse about Vishnu – that “śāntākāraṃ bhujagaśayanaṃ padmanābhaṃ sureśaṃ|
viśvādhāraṃ gaganasadṛśaṃ mēghavarṇa śubhāṅgam | .
Lakṣmīkāntaṃ kamalanayanaṃ yōgibhirdhyānagamyam||” 

(Meaning: He who has a peaceful form, who lies on the serpent (Ananta), who has a lotus on his navel, and is the Lord of all gods, who is the support of the universe, boundless like the sky,
cloud-coloured and radiant with auspicious limbs, He who is the consort of Goddess Lakshmi, has lotus-like eyes, and is reached through meditation by the yogis...) Prayer to Vishnu. This appears within the dhyāna slōka of the Vishnu Sahasranāmā, which is from the Anushasanika Parva of Mahābhāratā. Composed by sage Vyasa.

 So far so good. But where is the Mekha (the real essence)?  “योगिर्भिध्यानगम्यम्।”

“yōgibhirdhyānagamyam” This is a description of what the yogi knows from their meditation.

Even about each deity, "Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatēna manasā paśyanti yaṁ yōginaḥ |"

(Meaning: Whom the yogis behold in their minds, absorbed in deep meditation...

 Everywhere you look today, the people try to restrain their seeking and refraining from the seeking the depth.  But what happens is we stop at the hint of understanding the truth and we don’t go deeper. the Supreme Being (typically Vishnu) as one who can be realized or seen only through deep, focused meditation—when the mind is fully united with the Divine.) Shrimad Bhāgvatam chapter 5.2.5

Now let us look at another type of religion that started: Christianity or Muslim religion. Jesus and Mohamad said, “If we do flower things, we don’t get honey, so let’s do honey things.” They said that God is formless, so you become formless. But how to do this? That’s what happened. They do things with honey, not flowers. Humans are human. Humans do not know the Supreme. So what happened is, we tied a horse behind the cart and we try driving the cart and we complain, “Why doesn’t the cart run?” Dharmāchi (religion) is within us. Everyone has said it. Everyone has said that there is Paramātmā (Primordial Self) inside us. But what happens is that no matter how much is said, it is simply talk. The truth is not understood by our head and our heart.

I had gone to this Gurudwārā (Sikh Temple) in the afternoon. Some people started singing a song by Nanak: “Kāhē rē ban khōjan jāi, sarab nivāsi sadā alēpā tōhi sang samāī | Pupsapa madhye jo vasa vasat hai, mukhur māhe jas chhāi, Taise hi Hari base nirantar ghathai ki jo bhāi |

(Bāhar bhitar eak jāno yaha guru gyān batāi|  Jana nānk bina apā chinai, mite nā bhrama ki kāhi|)”

 (Meaning: Why go to the forest searching for God? He lives in all, untouched, always with you. Just as fragrance is in the flower, and reflection is in the mirror, In the same way, the Lord dwells within your heart. He is one, inside and outside,  this is the wisdom the true Guru gives. Without knowing your own Self, says Nanak, the illusion will not end.) Nānak Sāheb

So why are you searching out there? God is within you. The bamboo plant flowers only when it is in the shade. In the same way, Shri Hari (God) is in your heart. Now the song is sung, “If you are not looking you won’t find it.” “Ah,” God said, “what are you singing?” No point of constantly repeating Ghathai (God is within you). Once you get Self-realisation you will experience the reality). If you want to take medicine and the doctor tells you, “Eat some ginger with sugar, it will be good.” When you come home you keep repeating, “I eat ginger with sugar, I eat ginger with sugar,” what effect will that have in curing your illness? That is our way. We don’t do what we should do, we just talk about it. Therefore, I say that we should meditate. But how can we do this? No one discusses this. You will meet so many people that speak about love, love the whole world! Can love be taught? Can you love electricity? Love is inherent and that is how we feel. We love our children, we love our fathers, we love our mothers, we love our wives, and we love our husbands. Automatically we feel love. There is no teaching how to love. Even religion is not taught. God is within us from birth. How do we recognise this? This is a dilemma that everyone faces: how to find God within us? How to know Paramātmā?  How to achieve Self-realization? Many people say, “Yes, it can happen. You must stand on your head for twenty-five minutes every day, and say God’s name. ” Nothing will happen! It is a lie. “You must wear saffron coloured robes and dance and jump around and you will find God! It’s so easy!” So what about buying a simple printed sari for two rupees and dancing? Someone will say, “It will not happen that way. You must go to the temple and God will save you.”

 A man like Tulsidās – who wrote such a big Rāmāyana – used to chant the name of God all the time. God himself came to visit Tulsidas three times calling himself Raghuveer. Then even when Tulsidas put sandalwood paste on Rama’s forehead still Tulsidas did not recognize Him.

One man from “Hare Rāmāwālē, Hare Krishnāwālē” (Hare Rama Hare Krishna path people) came to visit me from Mumbai. He said to me, “Mataji, you don’t take the name of God?” 

Hey, do you know anything about naming? Just take someone’s name? Tomorrow you’ll come to my door and say, ‘Mataji, Mataji,’ but if you meet me on the street, will you even recognize me? Do you agree with me? I say: “Come in, get to know him first. It’s going to be hard to even name him once if you don’t.”

Then they started saying, “We’ve given up everything. We’ve renounced so much—by doing this, by doing that, we went to the forest. We’ve done this and that. But you sit in your house, with your children and grandchildren—how do you do it? You didn’t leave anything behind?”

I said, “Look, let me tell you this—you have a challenge. Pick up anything in my house, any object, even if it’s covered with the dust from the feet of the Supreme Being, even if it’s just dust particles—I’m ready. Go ahead, look around,” I said. “Pick up anything which you think is holy, that matters.”

“There’s nothing like that here,” he said.

Then he added, “So there’s nothing like that, and yet you say you left everything and caught hold of something?” “Hey, we didn’t catch anything—so what?”

Now, tomorrow, stand before the sea. If you decide in your mind that the sea belongs to you, then you’re caught. Doesn’t that mean you’re foolish? And if you say, “I’ve caught it, and now I’m free,” what kind of freedom is that? You haven’t caught anything, and who even cares?

‘Mēlō’(death-died)—means everything stays here, including the fort. It doesn’t matter to you. So who is catching, and who is letting go? If God could be found through such foolishness, then God, too, must be a fool!

But He is Almighty. Just think—what power He has! If there’s a powerful magnet in one place and you’re off somewhere dancing around with your tiny magnet, jumping, standing on your head, doing all sorts of things—will the magnet come to you? Is that possible?

No. Just let go of the little power you think you have. Just surrender. The magnet is already there to pull you. Its force is so great that we are naturally drawn to it. But He wants it to happen through your free will. You must want it. He will not force you. You have to desire to become one with God. God has created man in His own image. This relationship is one of deep respect. Humans have the freedom to choose.

These days, in Mumbai, there’s a lot of hypnosis—people perform all sorts of magic. They make people dance like puppets with charms, jump, do all kinds of things. And people pay thousands of rupees for it! And we love it, folks! But people don’t want real freedom. They don’t want to recognize their true glory—what they truly are! How great it is! Now, Pradhān Sāheb (a Sahaja Yogi) told a story about a beggar. Sometimes, people become beggars—not by circumstance, but by choice. We may not know this.

Suppose there is a great queen who is born again, but in her life she faces great suffering—from her husband, from her household. The burden of being a queen becomes too much for her. So she prays, “Lord, make me a beggar in my next life, but don’t make me a queen again!” And so, in her next birth, she is a beggar. But inside, she is still a queen. In the way she carries herself, in her inner being—she is Royal. You may have seen this: many rich people behave so poorly, so much like beggars. And yet, how rich some poor people are—on the inside!

God works tirelessly to help you recognize the Supreme. He is making all the arrangements for you. You are born again and again to help you refine your choices. You are the one who brings yourself to that place—and when you arrive, you find God already there.

If someone is a very devout Brahmin and says, “I hate all Muslims and all Mlenchchās”—(foreigners; the Sanskrit term mlechchhā was used by the Vedic peoples much like ancient cultures labelled outsiders)—you may be surprised that in the next life, he may be born as a Muslim. Yes, truly! I’m telling you. People work so hard here... We have now gone to Tehran. And in Tehran, people are meditating! While Muslims are ringing bells and chanting, here we see Brahmins in Mumbai praying in their own way. What madness! People go to one extreme and then swing to the other. No one wants to see the bigger picture.

In the next life, you might be born a Harijan (a Dalit, one of the so-called “untouchables” of India.) Do you have any right over your birth? No. But if you hate someone in this life, in the next life the world will reflect that hate back to you. What you say will return to you.

My Sahaja Yoga is very easy for someone who has come out of this excess.
“Sahaja” means “born with you” or “spontaneous”—natural and easy.

If I asked you to remove a seed from another seed, could you do it? No. You cannot create a living sprout from a seed yourself. And yet, look at the mind of man! Building a house, putting up walls—what’s the big deal? Dead bricks and a dead house. Is there any life in that?

Can we create even one living thing in this world? What a man thinks of himself! But truly, nothing we do is really our doing. We just feel like we’re doing something, but we don’t actually do anything. We think we do everything. The truth will not become pakkā (mature, solid) until we realize it. We cannot recognize the truth until we experience the power of it.

Please, don’t believe what I say blindly. It is impossible to reach Paramātmā (the Supreme Self) through superstition.

Suppose you enter a dark room. I own the room. I know where the windows and doors are, and how everything is arranged. As soon as you come in, I say, “Look, sit here, there’s a Sataranji (carpet) for you. Here’s the lamp. There’s the light switch.”

Slowly, you begin to recognize and understand. If you can experience it—then you will believe it. If you are unable to experience it, you won’t believe it at all. So sometimes, an atheist is actually more honest than someone who blindly believes.

That’s not to say all believers are bad. What I mean is—a person who clings too tightly to something will struggle to enter the ocean of God's love.

If you want to get into the sea, you have to let go of whatever you're holding on to at the shore.

If you want to enter this hall, you must leave the ladder or stairs outside. Does that mean the stairs are bad? No. But you still have to leave them behind to get inside. How else will you enter? Then comes the second question:
“Shri Mataji, how is that possible? In the past, only one or two people achieved self-realization. And now you say there are thousands. How can that be?”

Why not? If in the past only one or two trees had flowers, and now thousands of trees have blossomed—won’t there be thousands of fruits? Haven’t you seen such a spring in life?

Something may have improved in this age. And this is bound to happen in Kali Yuga—the age of darkness and conflict, yes, but also the time when transformation becomes possible for many.

Otherwise, how will Satya Yuga come?
(Satya Yuga is known as the Age of Truth, when humanity is governed by the Divine.)
To transform Kali Yuga and bring in Satya Yuga, something special must happen—something within all living beings, collectively. Without that, Satya Yuga is not possible.

Right now, humanity stands at a crossroads—either in the pool of good or the pool of evil. If people do not decide, at this very moment, that we want to bring Satya Yuga, then I have no doubt that the whole world will face destruction.

But first, what’s already sitting in your head must be emptied a little. People read so much, see so many gurus and sadhus—but what have they really received? Are you happy? Have you found peace? Have you been taught the true meaning of love?

Love should flow through your hands. Happiness, peace, and love go hand in hand.

These here are my disciples. I say this clearly: I don’t focus on healing people anymore because time is short—I want to make doctors. These people, with their hands alone, can bring healing. That’s how it should be. No need for complicated therapy. The energy flows. And it’s simple. But those tied up in medical ideas resist. They say they don’t want to be “pushed into the sea.” But whoever wants to enter the ocean must leave the shore behind.

I myself have wandered along the shore for so long. If peace were found in that, I would have seen it somewhere. If love were truly there, I would have felt it. But I have seen so many monks and ascetics—none of them had what has come to our disciples and what will also come to you.

Just the other day (Parvā)—I had gone to near Vasai. A hundred people crossed over! You’ll be surprised. And what a tremendous experience! So amazing! How it is possible? people wonder; but it is.

 From my childhood, I was born in a state of spiritual awareness. I carried with me the awareness of past lives. But in this birth, I realized: if I don’t give Self-Realization to people—if I only give speeches and say, “Love one another, be good people”—it will not work. So many books have been written, but what has changed?

There must be a system where I can take people, even briefly, and show them something beyond what they’ve ever imagined—something greater. If I can do that, they’ll say:
“Mataji has taught us something beyond anything we knew.”

Now look at us today—how few young people remain truly young, innocent? I had gone to Baroda and gave a talk at the university. And afterward, our people said, “We won’t, give up our direction Mataji.”

I asked, “Why not, my child? What’s the matter?”

The mindset today is: if someone dies, condemn them; if someone disagrees, kill them or cut them off. This is the state of our children. Why? Because of us.
We spent so much money in the name of religion. We ran fast in that direction. And now, the younger generation looks at us and says,
“This idiot got nothing from it—so why should we fall into the same trap?”

So they’ve chosen another path. Anything but what we followed.

This is the condition of our children. But it's not quite the same with children in the United States. Over there, young people see through religion. They understand it didn’t give them what they needed. If it had, why would they be so angry? Why would they face such inner turmoil?

And what has religion become? They say: “Leave it all. We don’t want a house. We don’t want a mother or father. We’ll do whatever we want. We don’t want money. We’ll leave everything.” But who is really going to benefit from this?

Suppose we thought we could hold on to everything. We are standing on the ground, rooted. And in that moment, man does not want to give up anything. Wherever he stands, he stands in awe. But what we don’t realize is that the whole system—our body, our being—has already been beautified by the Supreme Being within us since time immemorial.
We must simply fall into it. Trust it.

Your Mother is already in your womb—within you. She is quietly sitting there, giving birth to you again, preparing to reincarnate you. She is placing you in that state of second birth. She is sitting in you.

But people have forgotten this. Where is your vision? Now it’s all about:
“How much money do you make?” No? Then: “Stand for election.” Or:
“Go serve the people somewhere!” But beyond that—they don’t see. And no matter how hard they try, they cannot return to Dharmā—because they’ve lost the way. Nowadays, people want to save time. Save time, save time... But why save time? We should instead ask—are we content? We should understand that time is a gift from God.

Everything that exists outside of us has come from within. God gave man the clock not to run faster, but so you could save time to go inward. But what happens? As soon as work ends and people have free time—they panic! They run away to the cinema or somewhere else.
They can’t even sit alone for five minutes. They are afraid of their own company. They are running from themselves. Why? Because deep down, they believe they are dirty.
But the truth is—they are so beautiful.

If you told me, “Stay in this room for three months,” I would be delighted. I would never feel bothered: because I am beautiful within. I can sit still, in silence, and be in joy.

You must understand Sahaja Yoga in simple language. Yes, many books have been written on Kundalini. Some say it can deteriorate you. Others say if someone awakens the Kundalini, terrible things will happen. There are many such stories. But those who have truly awakened the Kundalini know—it is a mechanical, natural process.

Some people even make shameful claims, associating Kundalini with sex. But this Kundalini is your Mother. She can forgive anything. But if you accuse your own mother of something so impure, won’t she be angry?  They say the Kundalini is dangerous or angry—and yet, they throw all kinds of allegations at her. What ignorance! Kundalinī (means “coiled” or “circular”—the coiled life force at the base of your spine, your deepest potential.)

If there is someone through whom the love of God is flowing, then it is easy for that person to grow, to evolve. Just like watering a tree—if you give it water, it bears fruit effortlessly.
But you have to give it water, not pour kerosene on it! Water is life. Kerosene is dead. Kundalini cannot be awakened by dead things.

So what does “Kundalini” mean in simple terms? It’s not “mine,” this microphone — the one I’m speaking through, the energy that’s flowing, we have created this mechanism perfectly, with divine purpose. God has made everything for man, for everyone—whether educated or uneducated, from India, England, or America.

Just as a beautiful machine is crafted with precision, man, too, has been created by the Supreme Spirit—with a divine connection already built in. And now, the task is simply to reconnect that connection back to Paramātmā, the Supreme Self. This is what Sahaja Yoga is. It is easy. It is natural. It is already within you.

There are already so many scriptures out there. I myself am also writing books—for those who wish to read. But still, I ask—why am I writing a book? Because I’ve seen how people take a scripture, cling to a mantra written in it, and just keep repeating it. That’s all.
So sometimes, writing a book feels like a wasted effort. Even this speech—many will hear it, but only remember the parts that fit their own way of thinking. Forget my speech too. Forget everything. Just as you forgot all the steps you took to come into this hall.

You don’t need to chant a mantrā. You don’t need to say “Guru.” You don’t even need to repeat God’s name over and over. Everyone has thoughts. But there is a small space—a moment—between one thought and the next. In that tiny space, I want you to bring your attention to me.

Any thought—be it of Guru, Dharmā, or God—is still a thought. And once you go beyond those thoughts, then everything begins to make sense. Only then does the Guru make sense.
Only then does the idol of Rāmā have meaning. Everything becomes clear.

Even this shawl I’m sitting on carries my vibrations. People have healed many illnesses simply by using photos of my feet. Even the water used to wash my feet has been used to cure ailments. But I’m not surprised.
Why shouldn’t it be possible? If this power comes from the Supreme Being—the One who designed all of creation—then why can’t all diseases vanish?

But first, you must awaken your inner strength. And this must come in complete freedom. Once it happens—then the Guru makes sense. Then the idol of Rāmā makes sense.
Then everything makes sense.

Now look at today’s world. Jupiter’s wisdom is missing. All the ancient footsteps—fifty of them—are gone. The village gurus have vanished. And the tide of America is flowing in.

People practice Mōhīnī Vidyā (some kind of mesmerism or black magic.) They put a spell, a weapon, on you. They seduce you with charm. They take your money. And once you have nothing left—they take your property too. I say, why should the work of God need money?
It’s such a simple thing. Everything truly important is free—your breath, your heartbeat.
Ask someone how it works. A doctor will say, “It’s automatic.”
So who is that “self” inside that makes the heart beat? Tell me—who is He? And look how easy it is! That’s the point: If it’s difficult, it’s not divine. Divine things must be simple.

But man has this strange idea: “If I don’t suffer for it, I can’t enjoy it.” People think unless they travel far, break a few limbs, work hard, and exhaust themselves—only then does something feel valuable.

Let me give a simple example—a mother. She cooks for you. You’re hungry. The food is ready. She says, “Come, sit down and eat.” But if you’re not hungry, instead of eating, you start asking her questions: “Where did you go, Mummy? Where did you get this food? How did you make it?”

Now if I were to give you a radio as a gift, you’d immediately open it up, check if it works, and happily say, “Look what Mummy gave us!” You wouldn’t ask for the entire engineering manual first, would you? Yet this is how people behave in spiritual matters.
Suppose tomorrow I announce, “There’s a diamond here.” Do you know what would happen?
People from all over Delhi would arrive by the plane loads, just to see it. 

But when it comes to spirituality, people hesitate. They say, “How can something so valuable be free?” They become suspicious: “How is it possible for this to be so easy?” But I say again: The more important a thing is, the more easily it should be given.

People in America have asked me: “Mataji, everyone here charges us $150 to $300. But you don’t even take one dollar. Why?” I reply: “Tell me—how much should it cost?” These are not spiritual seekers. They are subconscious beings who have come to fool you. And people pay them—happily! Then they feel proud: “Wow! Look how far we’ve flown—for God!”But ten years later, when they’ve gone mad from it all—then they come to me for healing.

That is to say, all these kinds of things people speak of—these so-called mystical powers, the “knowledge of the afterlife”—they are illusions. As many Bābāji as there are, they all talk about the afterlife, about hidden powers and secret realms. But what are they actually doing? They plant demons on you. They take all your money, destroy your peace, destroy your children, and in the end, you’ll be left standing on the streets, tying up your bags, preparing to leave for America—empty-handed.

There are so many criminals now, pretending to be saints. Tied-up hair, saffron clothes, glowing faces—and nothing but lies behind them. People are just now beginning to understand. These ones know the art of illusion, the art of throwing dust in your eyes—but you don’t even realize it’s happening! And you’ll be shocked to hear this—five demons and five more demons have already taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

All of them have returned—from Rāvanā to Narakāsurā. But they won’t call themselves Rāvanā. No! They’ll say: “I am God!” “I am the incarnation!”“I am your path to liberation!”

They don’t want to know you. They don’t want your growth. They want your money, your devotion, your blind faith. There is magic in them—not love. They are like the ancient illusory monsters, born again.

And you, in your innocence, believe them. You say, “Oh, Bābājī came! He gave me a ring! I gave him two hundred rupees, and he blessed me!”  You’re a millionaire! Why do you need blessings in the form of rings? Has a single poor man received that diamond? No—only the rich are being gifted. Each one receives a diamond necklace. Why? What lack of diamonds do the rich have? Why not share with the poor?

Let me tell you a true story. One of my own relatives came to me and said, “Bābājī gave me a ring—a real diamond!” This man is very rich. I asked, “How many diamond rings do you already have?” He said, “Oh, maybe ten or twelve.” I said, “Then why take this thirteenth diamond? If you weren’t satisfied with twelve, will this one finally satisfy you? What for, brother?”

He replied,
“No, no! He saw my devotion!” And I laughed. “What devotion? Is devotion for sale in the market now? Go mad and buy it by the kilo!”

He said,
“I didn’t give him much... just five or six thousand rupees. He gave me the ring later.”

I told him,
“You’re under the influence of a spirit. A ghost. These rings—they’re spinning. That ghost is speaking through them. That’s your great knowledge? The 'knowledge of the afterlife'?”

All the demons have come in this Kali Yuga. And here I am, alone—telling people stories of love, saying to you: come to Sahaja Yoga. Let me light your lamp. Let the darkness be lifted, because each of you has a lamp so bright, so powerful that if it burns even once, it will destroy all of this illusion. And not only that—it will radiate love.

The true character of love is like the vast ocean. No matter how many waves crash upon it,
the ocean doesn’t shrink—it grows larger. The weapon of love is more powerful than any weapon in the world. One day, that weapon will flow from within you, and when it does,
watch how the whole world trembles—not with fear, but with awe. They will run—not because they are enemies, but because truth pierces illusion.

Everyone must pass through this world. Even if Lord Krishna were to return, He would say, “Don’t kill Kamsā—he’ll be reborn anyway.” Even if Rama comes and slays Rāvanā,
only the body dies—he is born again and again.

This is the strange situation we are in. Rāvanā, has returned... as a sadhu. Narakāsurā has returned... wearing saffron. The war is not over. It never was. But the only weapon that can win now... is love. “Let’s See How Dhulyā Receives It”

I’ve heard a lot of good things about this place, Dhulyā. It’s as if the air here carries waves—vibrations that reach within. And when that happens, work can be done. I want to say just one or two things clearly:

Don’t be stubborn. A child who stubbornly refuses to listen makes the mother suffer. You explain, you plead, but the child won’t budge. That’s how we are with God sometimes. We wait too long. And when the Ganga comes to our doorstep, we don’t take from her. But tell me—when your jug is already full, what can even the Ganga do for you? If the Sun stands at your door and you won’t open it, is it the Sun’s fault?

A householder once came to me and said, “Mataji, my daughter is so sick. If you heal her, I will believe in you!”
And I said, “I don’t heal anyone. That’s your idea. I’m not doing anything to anyone. I am simply standing in the middle, like this microphone through which I speak. Now imagine if tomorrow this microphone declared, “I’m the one speaking!” How foolish that would be.

I am hollow—just like the Murali (Krishna’s flute).

Once, Radhā got jealous and asked the flute: “What’s so special about you that you are always on Krishna’s lips?”

And the flute replied: “I am special because I am nothing. I am empty. I have no ego, no blockages. He plays—and I simply let the sound pass through. I witness it. I am just a hollow channel.”

That’s what we need to become—hollow. The moment you become hollow, God’s music will begin to play through you, and you’ll hear beauty like never before.

That’s what Sahaja Yoga is. Not struggle. Not rituals. It is just the natural flow of energy through you. And children—they cross so easily. They don’t overthink. There’s a little Muslim boy from Mumbai, Shabbir. Just ten years old. He received realization and became so peaceful! He now points and tells me, “Mataji, the energy is flowing from here, not from there!” Children see it! They feel it.

Sometimes, people who follow fake gurus come to me with blisters on their palms—literal blisters! These are signs. This energy exists. But to be protected from these falsehoods, you must receive your own realization.

People often worry about Maharashtra’s drought and poverty. I know what’s in their hearts. But even in such hardship, I say—sometimes famine brings clarity. Once, I told a Minister of Maharashtra, “Why not dig wells like they do in Punjab?” And he said, “It will cost too much.”

But look—what is real wealth? You can be rich and still miserable. You can be poor and still full of light.
One of our drivers in Mumbai once said, “Mataji, I feel happier now than I did when I was a king in my past life.”
He had been a king—but in this life, as a simple driver, he finally found peace.

Wealth and poverty are not in the pocket—they’re in the mind. Some people eat ten times as much as I do and still remain hungry. I can go a whole day with just one meal, and I feel full. They need a bed, a fan, soft pillows—I can sleep on the floor, even on the road. I am free. That is the real kingship: The emperor is the one who doesn’t need anything.

Gold, diamonds—what are they? They are just stones. A person may be poor in money but rich in spirit. Another may have millions, but beg for one more rupee.

Let go of these illusions—meet the Supreme within you, and you will have all the wealth you need.

I await the Satya Yuga. I wonder: Will it come to India first, or America?
Sometimes I think we Indians still want to take a few more rounds on the cycle of rebirth. Especially in Mumbai!

Let’s see how Dhulyā receives it. Because His grace and love are flowing constantly, waiting only for an open heart.

 We conduct meditation experiments in Mumbai. If you want to try—just close your eyes. That’s all. There’s nothing to do. To do anything means to move away from God. You don’t “do” eating, you just sit and eat. In the same way, sit with ease.

The power that flows through me can flow through you. If you’re sick, you’ll feel healing.
If your body is strong and your mind isn’t cluttered, you’ll become thoughtless—effortlessly. People say it’s hard to go beyond thoughts. I say—no, it’s easy.

If you want to go to Baroda, do you first travel to America and Japan before arriving there? Of course not! You take the direct route. Sahaja Yoga is that direct route. You’ll become thoughtless, and after that, you’ll feel it in your hands. Let your hands verify the experience.

There are many people here today. If you’ve brought small children, and they cry a lot, please take them outside during the process so others may not be disturbed.

Within 15 to 20 minutes, something will happen. It has for thousands already. Their Kundalini awakened, they became introspective, and nothing bad happened. Not one case!

The first experience is this: You will become thoughtless, and from there, everything begins. Science says a lot, and now we know a lot. But the experience is so simple. If this room were dark, and your eyes were closed, and you came in from outside—you wouldn't know where to go. You wouldn't suggest anything. But say someone took your hand and whispered, “Here’s a lamp. Sit here...” Slowly, something begins to glow. You might not see the whole room, but a little corner becomes clear. 

But imagine if there’s someone—a doer—who can bring full light into the room. Suddenly, your eyes open, and you can see everything. That’s the power of true spiritual experience.

In America, their eyes are already wide open. They've had everything—money, houses, freedom. So now they're looking inward. Now let me speak of the mind—this wild, funny thing. It's your vehicle, but also your guru! Today, you say, “I want a watch!” The mind won’t let you sleep until you get it.
Then you buy it—and immediately it says: “This wasn’t enough.” Now it runs after something else.
And you run behind it, thinking happiness is just ahead. But every time, it leaves you saying: “I’m not happy, still not happy.” So you look again. You try to find something. You run in circles. And in the end—this mind won’t help you. Not like this.

Meditation helps you tame the mind—not by fighting it, but by befriending it. It’s like a horse. If the owner fights the horse, the horse rebels. But if he says gently, "Friend, I want to go somewhere," the  horse says, "Let’s go."

Psychologists say the same—make friends with the horse. But the problem is...no one knows where they want to go! And that’s why nothing happens. Realization isn’t something you force. It happens naturally, automatically—Sahaja.

Let’s talk science now. People ask me, “Where is this Kundalini? How does it work?”

When a baby is just two months in the mother’s womb, life force enters the body. It descends from the plate of the head, moves through the central nervous system, through the spinal cord, and settles in the sacrum bone—a bone even the Greeks called “sacred.” 

This force, when it moves upward, it touches chakras—energy centres. On the outside, science knows them as plexuses. Doctors call it the autonomic nervous system, the parasympathetic branch.
And I ask them, “Who is the ‘auto’ in autonomous? Who runs the heart?” They have no answer.

In the U.S., I met neurologists who admitted: “We don’t know how to stimulate the parasympathetic system. It just happens on its own.” But I showed them—practically—how to awaken it.

What miracle could be greater than this? People run after money magic, pulling coins from the air, or removing thumbs. That’s not a miracle. That’s ghosting!

Once, a funny thing happened. There was a wedding in UP. The Brahmins wanted Dahivade (a sweet-sour dish) but in winter, UP Brahmins don’t make that. So they went to a Babāji who claimed he could deliver it through divine means.

They gave him money. Babāji locked himself in a room. After two days, Dahivade (snack-yogurt and pakodā) was ready! Everyone ate well. But the next morning, someone from a lower caste community came and said, “Who brought our food vessels here? That food you ate last night... it came from us!”

The Brahmins were furious. See what happened? The Babāji used ghost magic—subtle manipulation of matter. But what did they really do? Feed you today, and sit on you tomorrow. And if you dare complain later, they'll say, "Didn’t we feed you that day? Didn’t we heal you?"
But for that tiny help, they now control your energy.

Let me give you another story. In England, there was a man, Dr. Lang, who died. After death, his spirit attached itself to a soldier. The ghost instructed: “Go to my son, tell him I’m his father. Open my clinic again—I will perform surgeries through you.” The soldier did it. The ghost proved his identity with signs. The clinic opened. People began to get results.

But what happened? Soon, ten more spirits joined in. Now the house was full of ghost doctors, all operating on people through the soldier. Eventually, people came to me, crying, “Mataji, we are suffering. What is this trouble?” You see, this is not spiritual power—this is possession.

These things are subtle, and most people don’t recognize them. Someone gives a speech, and people start to sway, to sing, to fall. They praise him, they throw money, and he gathers power. But remember—true power needs no money. True transformation needs no drama. You just sit, gently, and it begins.

So what is real? What is the truth? The truth is that the energy within you is alive. The truth is that your mind can become your friend. The truth is that real miracles are inner peace, thoughtless awareness, and self-realization—not ghosts and games. The truth is that Sahaja Yoga is your birthright.

Classically, as much as science tells us about the plexuses in the body, the sages told us centuries ago about the chakras. And what a surprise—they match so closely. Take the Mooladhārā Chakrā, the root. Doctors know this as the pelvic plexus. It has four petals, just like the scriptures say—Chaturdalam.

Now normally, in an average person, only subtle currents are visible, but when someone is fully awakened, that pelvic plexus  looks just like four radiant lotus petals, perfectly formed, and spinning at the centre. And if you were to peer inside that space with spiritual vision... you might see a tiny light revolving... and inside that light—Shri Ganeshā!

Not an imagination—not a creation of thought. He simply is.
You didn’t do anything. He appeared: from within.

But here’s the tragedy—people have misunderstood this chakra. They’ve confused Shri Ganesh’s trunk—his curved proboscis—for the Kundalini itself. So, they sexualized it.
The most sacred force, the Mother Kundalini, wrongly linked to sex—when she has nothing to do with it!
And then, when people feel heat or strange reactions during awakening—because of their own impurities—they blame the Kundalini!

They say, "Don’t awaken her, she’ll chew you up!"
But you insulted your own spiritual mother, and now you fear her?

Let me tell you—Shri Ganeshā is the eternal child, pure, without desire. That’s why, when you approach spirituality, you must become like a child: innocent, open-hearted, and free of ego.
Only then will the Mother awaken.

The mind that says, “I’ve read this book, that scripture, I’m a great scholar,” will never receive realization.
Rāmdās Swami used to say: “Oh Mother, if I grow too big, let’s see what you do.”

But when the child is small, the mother gives milk on time. She protects, loves, nurtures.
If you become like a small child—acknowledging, “What I’ve read is nothing. What I know is nothing. I am a child”—
then, the Mother recognizes you, and realization happens naturally.

People often ask me, “Mataji, why hasn’t it happened for me?” And I say, “We don’t make it happen. We don’t want anything. It’s not us doing it.” It is He who works through me. In front of you, it may seem like I am doing something, but the truth is—He works through this instrument. And if your heart isn’t like a child’s, nothing can be done.

Let me tell you a beautiful moment.

There was a little boy, he started talking early, bright and clear.
I asked him,
“Munnā, who are you? Are you Indian?”
He said, “No.”
“Are you Muslim?”
“No.”
“Are you Japanese?”
“No.”
I asked, “Then who are you?”

And he said with shining eyes: “Mummy, you forgot? I’m your little one.”

That’s it. The only truth is: “I am your child.”
All other labels—Hindu, Muslim, Indian, and American—are fabrications.
God must be wondering, “What is this? I never made Hindustan or Pakistan. I made the stars, the oceans, the galaxies... not these divisions!”

We did that. We made boundaries. And then fought wars over them.

There’s an old story of Meerā Bāi, the great saint. She once went to Vrindavan, and wanted to meet Tulsidās, a great celibate.
She sent word: “I want to see you.”
He replied, “I’m a child celibate. I don’t meet women.”

And Meerā, with the wisdom of a realized soul, sent back: “I didn’t know anyone lives in Vrindavan who isn’t my Krishna. Everyone here is my child.”

Tulsidās was ashamed. He said, “Mother, forgive me.”

Because that’s the difference in vision: if you see through innocence, everyone is a child of God.
But if you carry pride, labels, ego—you miss the truth entirely.

Now don’t misunderstand. A woman should be a woman. A man should be a man. This isn’t about confusion. In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t want men trying to become women, or women trying to be men.
Let men be strong, and let women be gentle.

Some women in America said to me once, “These men rule over us!”
I smiled and said, “Oh? What a kingdom they rule! We are queens.”

You see, the real strength lies with the woman who carries the burden of the whole household in silence. She bears it with grace. That’s her Shakti(her inner power.)

So understand, this path is not about knowledge or performance. It’s about childlike surrender, inner clarity, and seeing yourself beyond name, form, or culture. You are not your religion. You are not your country. You are not your title. You are the child of the Divine Mother. Let her awaken within you. Let Shri Ganeshā sit in your Moolādhāra. Let innocence return. And then, the true Kundalini, the pure, gentle mother, will rise. And you will know who you really are. 

Take, for example, Sitā. When Rāmā told her, “You must go to the forest,” what would have happened if she were living today? If she were a modern woman, she might have marched to the court, filed a lawsuit, and demanded justice. “You married me in front of everyone, and now you’re telling me to go to the forest? How unfair! I’m going to sue you for this.” And if she had children, no doubt, she would have filed for double compensation!
This is the attitude of the modern world: lawsuits, complaints, and protests. But Sitā—she did nothing of the sort. With grace and dignity, she left for the forest. There was no fuss, no complaint. The stigma was placed on her, yet she never reacted. She simply accepted her fate.

Many women today are quick to express their anger, whether at their husbands or children. The world is filled with women venting their frustration on their loved ones, but is this the way of a woman?
No, a true woman swallows her anger, nurtures peace, and brings happiness.

As the Manusmriti says: "Yatra nāryastu pujyantē, tatra ramantē dēvatāḥ" (Where women are revered, there the Gods rejoice.)
The essence of womanhood lies not in competing with men, but in embodying grace, compassion, and inner strength.

In the story of Sitā, Rāmā might have been wrong in banishing her, but in that moment, she displayed the ultimate strength. Even when she was abducted by Rāvanā, she held onto her purity and chastity.
Rāvanā, the mighty king, dared not touch her. Yet, she remained in the forest, unshaken, unaffected by the hardships.

When she returned, after being tested, she said to Rāmā, "Look at your sacrifice, and my sacrifice."
She knew the world would question her, would slander her, but she didn’t speak a word in her own defence. Her dignity and strength transcended words. And in the end, she disappeared into the earth, absorbed back into the very soil that gave her life.

Now, let me tell you the story of another woman: Noor Jahān. Noor Jahān fell in love with Prince Salim. She dreamed of marrying him. But the king, her father-in-law Ākbar, arranged for her marriage to another.
She could have rebelled, complained, but instead, she left for Bengāl, where she lived with grace and dignity, serving others. When Salim later became Jahāngir, the emperor, his actions led her to believe he was responsible for her husband's death. But what did she do? She didn’t rush into battle or outrage.
Instead, when Jahangir came to her, he fell at her feet, asking for forgiveness. She refused to meet him. Even when he had her arrested, she remained resolute: "If you touch me, keep your distance. Stay away." She was firm in her dignity.
And when Jahangir fell ill, his mother came to Noor Jahan, pleading with her to marry him.
Noor Jahan, wise and compassionate, agreed to marry the prince—not out of bitterness or anger, but out of her own deep sense of honour.

In the end, the prince was none other than Emperor Jahāngir, and she married him not as a victim, but as a woman who had risen through her own strength and understanding.

This is the power of women—of those who maintain their grace and nobility in the face of adversity.
A woman like this can never be oppressed, no matter how much others try. Her courage becomes her shield, and her love, her weapon.

Now, let’s talk about the world we live in today.
In dharmā, those who come as women, and those who come as men, have their distinct roles and responsibilities. But what about those who are “half-people,” as the texts say?
We’ve seen how the modern world has blurred these lines, and in some cases, it’s gone to extremes.
But dharmā teaches us to honour the sacredness of the roles of man and woman, and to understand that they are not interchangeable but complementary.

In a scientific sense, everything in our body—our plexuses, our nervous system—aligns with the principles described in the spiritual tradition. What I call the Kundalini in spiritual terms, is described in science as the parasympathetic nervous system. The experience of awakening, of rising, and the different states that come with it—this is a personal journey. It’s not something you can understand simply by reading about it. You have to experience it to feel it.

Imagine someone talking to you about honey—its taste, its origin, its benefits. No matter how much they explain, it will mean little until you taste it for yourself. And this is the same with spiritual awakening. You can read countless books, hear endless explanations, but until you experience the Kundalini awakening, it will remain just words. Once you experience it, you will want more—because the sweetness of that experience is incomparable to anything else.

The modern world is full of wealth, yet there is a spiritual emptiness. People accumulate riches, but their hearts are cold, as if they are walking through a graveyard. What good is all the money in the world if there is no love? What is the value of gold if it doesn’t bring happiness? In many wealthy homes, there’s an absence of love, a sense of emptiness. Yet, even in such wealth, they may feel the deep sorrow of loneliness. This is why true wealth is not measured by material gain, but by the depth of love and inner peace. So, in dharmā, we find balance. Men must understand their role as protectors and providers. Women must understand their role as nurturers and creators.
But both must also rise above their egos and their superficial identities, transcending labels like “Hindu,” “Muslim,” “rich,” or “poor.” We must awaken to the truth within. Feel it. Live it. Experience it. Only then will we truly understand the power of our own Kundalini and the eternal wisdom that lies within us.

Look at how beautiful you are, you have the form of Lakshmi.  Lakshmi’s, whole body is given the form of a woman, meaning she must be the form of a mother. The man who has Lakshmi should also embody the form of a mother. Think about how much care and responsibility your mother bears for you in her womb! If a man treats his servant like Lakshmi, then he is not Lakshmi's husband; he is a money-lender!

Lakshmi holds two lotuses in her hands. What do lotuses symbolize? They signify beauty. So, she should be beautiful, like a lotus—in her smile, on her face, in her demeanour, in her speech—everything about her should be beautiful. If a man constantly curses and then calls himself "Lakshmipati" (the owner of wealth), what does he mean by that? What Lakshmipati! Lakshmipati should be like a lotus. A house, like a lotus, should be beautiful and comfortable. Just as a beetle enters and rests peacefully in a flower, anyone who comes to his door should find comfort there.

But no, as soon as Lakshmipati starts barking orders at the four dogs in his house, he will not be seen as such. The identity of Lakshmipati is described as having one hand that shelter, and the other hand holds Lakshmi. This hand symbolizes protection. If someone seeks shelter under your roof, and you cannot provide it, what kind of Lakshmipati are you? Giving money to your children is not enough! Even animals care for their young, yet after a few days, their dependence disappears. But humans often display even lower behaviour. A miser saves all his wealth for his son, only for that son to squander it when he grows up.

Some might say, "Give a poor man two bucks!" But the same man who gives to others complains about his children’s demands. Your son should be well, and your daughter should be well—but in the end, those very children will be the ones troubling you! Such love is meaningless. It is limited love, which is the death of true love! Love that is not pure, like the water falling on a tree, may cause a flower to die along with it. What good is such love? If it is not in the hands of such a Lakshmipati, it is like an arrow—love that cannot be true, and without true love, there is no Lakshmipati.

In the past, Lakshmipati’s wife sat comfortably, feeling no pity while a woman next to her, who had no clothes to cover her body, but the wife felt no grief. How can one’s heart remain unmoved when seeing another’s suffering? If you do not feel the pain of those who have nothing, then your heart is either stone or empty.

True love transcends material things. It does not stop at family, as even a father who sacrifices everything for his son may be neglected in return. Yet, even as his children grow up and forget his sacrifices, he still wants to give them more. This limited love is the death of true love!

Love should flow freely, as the supreme creative power of the universe does. This love should touch every part of your being, and those who cannot love in this way, those who cannot open their hearts to others, will not know the true meaning of life or religion. The essence of God is love. Just as creation is driven by love, God is hungry for love. Without it, no matter how much wealth or status you have, it means nothing.

When you enter the ocean of love, there is no turning back. As love flows through you, it brings people to you. They come to you not for money or material gain, but to save you from the ocean of suffering. Compassion pulls from within and makes all other feelings seem insignificant. True love brings happiness, and through it, we are saved.

You do not realize that I do all this work on your heart. It’s all happening through the heartbeat—the entire game of the heart cycle. You’ve seen how the Kundalini moves on my hand! It’s all about love.

All of creation is done by the Supreme Being in pure love. We call it the creative power, but it is really His loving power. Just love, love, love! Write it three times. And the one who cannot be loved—a stone-hearted man—has no place here. A person who does not have love, who cannot open his heart and embrace others with it, will not attain this religion.

Do you think some sticks or threats will bring you to God? Or that by giving a hundred rupees to a pundit, you will reach God? No. That is not the way. God is hungry for love! Yes—even God is hungry for love! What a great thing, hey!

And once you start drowning in this ocean of love—what else is there? With this hand, serve that hand, and say, “Hey, how much have I served you:” b ecause you are all within my body. When only one force starts flowing from within you—just as it flows from this body—if one finger touches, the other responds immediately.

Now you see those who have crossed over—they come running to see you. This congregation, they’ve come to you at their own expense. They don’t want anything from you, not even your money. They have come only for you—why? To save you from that ocean: because inner love is the flow.

And for this love, I too have come running to you. If that love were not within me, then despite all the wealth I may have—outside or inside—I would need nothing. But compassion: compassion pulls so deeply from within that even inner happiness feels like nothing in comparison.‘Janmajanmāntari’ (the infinite cycle of rebirth) is born, is gathered here! But in this birth, there is no other way except through giving. Day and night, everything is for you. You only have to help me a little.
