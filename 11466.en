Talk to Sahaja Yogis in Ashram

Shri Mataji: That is directed, that is ultimate time has reached [unclear], na? [unclear], [German lady].

Sahaja Yogini: I don’t know the translation in English, Mother.

Shri Mataji: But intellectuals like Rajneesh.

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Is that true?

Sahaja Yogini: And he send them to the third [mantra].

Shri Mataji: So I don’t think the lady should have the child with her [unclear]. So somebody else should look after the child. Is there somebody who can look after the child, who has no children in the house? And even if you have children it’s good for the children to come together. It is very good for the children to get the [infection] once. You should get this [verily] it’s very good. But you tell them it’s dangerous.

Sahaja Yogini: It’s a big epidemia in the whole of Switzerland now.

Shri Mataji: Just now, when you see how is [unclear]. I asked her. She won’t sit in the house. She couldn’t face it up. The whole of the left, left side, especially the left Nabhi and right Vishuddhi, it’s a combination of the left Nabhi and right Nabhi and also right Vishuddhi, the combination. I think they didn’t have to do anything [right], but to sit all the time. But [also nothing to do, but the epidemic, it’s you have to work, and you have to work, like we have to work on... I was wondering what had happened, verily because never happen this, all right? If it happens to come here just remember to [unclear], all right? Please. I just couldn’t [put possible around], that suddenly. And I couldn’t lie down, immediately [they go in]. Suppose, if [unclear] trouble then you [read] one hundred and eight names of [that chakra]. Just read them once. And then after you watch this [right] after you. That’s the way it is. See, [Raju] has got it. Give him a bandhan. Is it for the grandparents like this? [unclear]. Take these hundred and eight names.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, [if we have time] we’ll see her today, too, and this is to discuss with her something.

Shri Mataji: Ah...

Sahaja Yogi: And Mother, [if there’s time] we’ll see her today.

Shri Mataji: Is her [Nabhi].

Sahaja Yogi: Her [Nabhi is a complain] and left Nabhi. Both things are [there].

Shri Mataji: It’s a negative, it’s a left-sided attack, you get. But in a way, you become immune to it. So when you get it you feel because you fight to the negativity through immunity, not through the [unclear].

Sahaja Yogini: [Usually, Mother, in different way OR Nowadays in Switzerland] they do vaccination.

Shri Mataji: [Rajneesh].

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, they give [the sickness] to the children, especially to the, [girls/those] before the age of thirteen.

Shri Mataji: Is it?

Sahaja Yogini: But I was not, I was not vaccinated.

Shri Mataji: [unclear] [You should all understand], I use Hamsa like that. Yesterday I talked about how to become a [Christian]. And you cannot feel you are not well but you can judge yourself. And you can be with your [unclear], you get the [video] from there. [unclear]

Sahaja Yogi: [French]

Shri Mataji: Now, today I did not have any intention of giving you a lecture but I just wanted to find out what sort of a problems you have in Lausanne. Because I’m coming to [Lausanne/Toulouse] for a program [every week] and one day in... One day in Lausanne or two days?

Sahaja Yogi: One day.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogini: One day, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Is it one day? And two days where?

Sahaja Yogi: Geneva.

Shri Mataji: There’s for two days. Is it so?

Sahaja Yogi: And one day in Strasbourg, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: One in Strasbourg.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, [in Strasbourg]. The people from Toulouse and Strasbourg are here, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogi: The people from Strasbourg and Toulouse.

Shri Mataji: Are there? Who are the people from Strasbourg?

Sahaja Yogi: [French]

Sahaja Yogini: From [the/new] Lausanne.

Shri Mataji: You are the people from [the/new] Lausanne.

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: You need this course of yoga?

Sahaja Yogi: Go to Strasbourg, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Strasbourg. Now what you have seen in Me?

Sahaja Yogi (translating from French): After program, after Your program about twelve people came back. They were all coming from the [Rosicrucian] and they went back there.

Shri Mataji: Hmmm.... All of them?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So many? And then, now there’s no one coming?

Sahaja Yogini: One young boy.

Shri Mataji: I feel crazy, [what they do], every time. The thing you know is, there were so many people in Lausanne. But if I go they’ll all disappear somehow. What did she say? What’s this?

Sahaja Yogini: That is the progress in Strasbourg.

Shri Mataji: I mean, they were together [do they]? [unclear]. You are doing that?

Sahaja Yogi: Four, Shri Mataji. At last there is the weddings, Puja and the Ganesha Puja; there is the weddings. Then You have two programs in Geneva, one in Lausanne, one in, one in Strasbourg and there is lot of travelling around, lot of travelling.

Shri Mataji: Seven days. Two days for Ganesh Puja, any days.

Sahaja Yogini: Sunday, Monday.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, because if we go on the, if we go before Zermatt to see the Matterhorn, to see this mountain for the Puja which we all hope it will work out, this is about three hours and a half from Geneva. Then Strasbourg is about three hours, four hours. Strasbourg is four hours from here. So I’m afraid it’s a lot of travelling.

Shri Mataji: Four hours from here?

Sahaja Yogi: Strasbourg, yes.

Another Sahaja Yogi: But we’ll get a plane.

Sahaja Yogi: No, no, we don’t have an airport.

Shri Mataji: And how far is Toulouse?

Sahaja Yogi: Toulouse is about near Strasbourg. It’s thirty miles away from Strasbourg. Seventy miles from Strasbourg.

Shri Mataji: It is Strasbourg and Toulouse. Which one you think it will work out first? Because in Strasbourg we have no one there.

Sahaja Yogi: We have Ruth and Kingsley. (translating for a Sahaja Yogini) She says Strasbourg is a city of students, is sort of European city because that’s why is the European Parliament and the Council of Europe.

Shri Mataji: It’s very important. I think you all should come. You can advertise the program about that tour in [villages].

Sahaja Yogi: If the people are coming there, then yes, we will do that.

Shri Mataji: So they can come if they want to Strasbourg, you see, because in Strasbourg we have got then Ruth and Kingsley, an hour station, and we had programs there before also. Strasbourg, we had people there. Only thing is that not yet very much established because [it sounds] could not be much there. But Toulouse people, if they can come to Strasbourg then it’s perfectly all right. They’ll go to Strasbourg. What happened to the journalist?

Sahaja Yogi: He was at Guru Puja, Shri Mataji. He came at Guru Puja. He, he wants us to report from Guru Puja something in the newspaper.

Shri Mataji: That’s why people’s establishing doesn’t work out. [Otherwise] even there we saw five hundred people [like if they count in] coming there and they were very much [at peace with themselves, with others, and very quiet. Then Puja is also, and the attention is, you see, just [meditate] and all were very well fit. So all these others permanently [seek for] permission to sit [unclear] outside the hall, to see five hundred people coming from all over the world and without [unclear]. And they all sat together, [ate] together, [unclear]. You can [go] for all these things into hell. So this is the least you can have. While you never see there strives and struggles and [unclear] to achieve this work. To find a group of people from all over the world [they will look plain, steady [unclear], and lot of struggles and [parties] and every sort of community were represented. All kinds of religions were represented. There was no quarrel, no fight, and everybody was enjoying each other.

There was such a [unclear] without any particular kind of [unclear]. I mean, anybody [unclear] there. It’s amazing how can we have young people so subtler, so [efficient], but anyway the people of that tour that they we brought them [unclear]. From what countries they had gathered, it’s a special resurrection. There’s a [team] over there. You see, all the way from Australia and everywhere, we had people there. And there was no sort of a funny behavior. People were not jumping. They were not shouting, screaming, [fighting] there. It was not there. It was a very, very beautiful combination of people. It was a very, very beautiful combination of sensible, mature people [we got there]. And there were children and nice people and people who were realized and very good family life. All this social life [type] of Sahaja Yoga, this is to describe that all will [live long] isn’t it, about all this tour. And also that, today, a special number of people who go to the cults, anything they, they are the people who say, quarrel everywhere, fight with each other. The reason is, they are actually primitive people. The reason is a very funny manner. Very surprisingly, they have no sophistication, there’s [no edibles] in that and they dress up same. For example, one group of people will dress up in one style, like Mahesh Yogi wants all of them to wear suits with lining, you see, because he’s saying [unclear]. So, and then another group will change their waste clothes with another clothes. They were wearing all the dresses of their own country. There was nothing compulsory on [their own] style, what he dresses up, how he dresses up. Nothing of the kind. But the whole personality of Sahaja Yogis is very, very [pleasant]. You see, automatically [they are up]?

Very homogeneous society, which you cannot see in these modern days. And the another aspect of Sahaja Yoga is that so many of them have cured diseases, like cancer, this, that. Without [taking any money], without [obliging anyone], they have worked on these people on the physical level and also on mental level, because there are two people [who had come actually] from [you know,] some lunatic asylum. And there were cancer patients who were cured and [someone only calculates] the cancer patients. It’s a, we should bring out the aspect that how Sahaja Yoga’s left without [patients itself] what are its good things in this world. Then there is nothing to worry for the people in this world. Wherever the Sahaja Yoga centers, wherever they are, everybody is welcome there, and nobody is charged any money or anything. And they can always take advantage of all that [unclear]. Thus can be very bad on physical, mental and emotional level and also [saves a lot].

You can say there are two, three families who were divorced and they remarried in Sahaja Yoga. Three families, you can say. And the children were also very happy, healthy, peaceful. Obedient and helpful. That kind of children you don’t find. Now see, I think it’s the best we can say that in Sahaja Yoga we do not have this doubting that means a person who maybe is just a very ordinary being is put there together with a man who may be a diplomat. [Tour/So] is better they said, [end of] background.

But it has not been done by mental projection. But when your Spirit awakens, then you see the universality of human beings, [universal is]. And then you live with that new personality, enjoying everybody’s presence, [amity of a person]. All perverse ideas like sex or about the violence, all these [left-sided], permanent catches, weaknesses, drop out. So there is no quarrel. There’s no violence. So peaceful is with the Sahaja Yogis. So one can say that a new race has already formed, it’s [beautiful/with you], and it is better to see that within. At that time if that can’t be explained, it’s all right because to the person [unclear], he might get pampered. And one starts feeling that there is God and there is also Christ to look after you. You know, the problem is with the fanatic structures and the wrong sides of taking their [concepts] about Christ. And the very existence it starts with that. And you know from where, about the controversy, there’s a man who says that the problem of [Christianity] is the miracle [of His life]. If they are to accept Christ they have to discard Paul. And if they have to accept Paul they have to discard Christ. This is the [foreign possession] for Christians.

So these are the days of our Judgment. Now do you believe in Christ or in Paul? Of course, Sahaja Yogis don’t believe in Paul. They believe only in Christ, because we can prove Christ came in as the Son of God. We can prove it. And it is so absurd that these people have no moral courage within. The Archbishop of, now the one will go to their [unclear], the one [unclear] who is a demon, who is a [unclear]. He is a fellow, who actually I saw him talking on the television, absolutely a horrible fellow, saying that Christ’s disciples could not describe Christ as He was but they just made a big imagination and symbolically. And I met the Vatican ambassador early and he told Me that, “No, these Christ’s disciples were not good. They were not intellectuals. But Paul was an intellectual. He is the one who is right.” The intellectuals are always against all these incarnations. Hardly they will believe and they’ll go to hell. And there’s one in India who’s saying that Saundharia Lahari was not written by Adi Shakharacharya because he was such a learned man. Why he would write that we must worship Mother?

If they try to destroy the image of Christ they will be destroyed themselves. You must know, you cannot destroy Christ. And the place where this fellow was given a big [oration], and also they celebrated his [appointment] was burned by the Vishnumaya, we call as the lightening. And they have, they have a, they have a way of escaping it by saying, now they say that it’s a miracle that only the roof was burned. They cannot relate to this fact that you cannot challenge Christ and His life and His disciples. They are the true thing. And this Mr. Paul was a Roman, who was a horrid fellow, who made so many sins in the sense that he, people were [clubbing] strong such people and he was looking at it and he was enjoying. But you see, Kahil Gibran has written about it long time back [before I said]. He said that, “This Paul I can’t understand. He’s a strange man. He is not a free man, he’s a free [soul] and whatever he talks, he does not believe it.”And this is what it is, that all realized souls understand Christ. And even Mohamed Sahib has said that Christ was the first word, that is, aumkara, aum. He also said that at the time of Resurrection your hands will speak. He also said that somebody was to come at the time of Resurrection.

And there is, there is another example of this Archbishop of Canterbury, [the former one] was asked by one of the horrible interviewers of BBC that, “What do you mean by Holy Ghost?”. So he answered, “I’m agnostic.” Also [said so] this Rabindranath, “Then what are you doing there?” He said, “I’m doing my job.” He [stayed] for it and he’s doing the job without being, having any faith in Holy Ghost. He says, “Now, let the Holy Ghost, bless you.” And then, “Believe in Holy Ghost.” How can Holy Ghost bless that people? And this Rabindranath could say, “Ha, your guru is doing the job like me,” so he said, “I’m a holy person.” These are the people of little faith that Christ has described. And today, at the time when Resurrection takes place, these people with the little faith will be finished. A man who has faith in Christ, is far away from this nonsense. And He’ll shatter them nicely and ask them questions, “What do you mean by this?”. But people think that He was born [and rather believe in this] Paul, an intellectual [unclear] most likely and I think it slipped attention.

So the judgment is going to be [this awareness]. And so many people now, you see, are getting [these days] as devils. How many people are going to come to Sahaja Yoga, we cannot say. Because the judgment, they have to judge. Nobody can force them; it is their freedom. As a Mother Myself, and you as Sahaja Yogis, must have compassion and understanding. And Christ will free out as many as possible from the darkness of ignorance. If they are to be saved you must put in all effort to save them. You see, there’s a responsibility in the sense of that power that we have to do it. Then you will not mind so many things, and you will see that as the people who have to save, as saviours for these people, we have to work hard, we have to take lots of insults, we have to be kind, we have to be diplomatic, we have to be gentle, [and trying] hard, but somehow or other get them together to [raise their being].

So all of you have to feel that we have to give realization to people, talk about Sahaja Yoga, discuss of it and you can work out. Any kind of a [gathering], anywhere, try to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga. A way could be you can wear a badge or something so people ask you questions. Will be a good idea. So [you try that]. [You need that en masse realization OR You don’t have to have My photograph], you can have Sahaja Yoga. Like in India they say “Sahaja Yoga is [unclear]. Long live Sahaja Yoga.” So that, you see, what happens that people have a curiosity to find out what it is. So this is [way] to be. This is what people have done before by sitting [unclear] have a nonsense there and without [unclear]. Because the method has to go through. I’ve already talked at length yesterday how to become a guru and I hope you’ll go to demonstrate and you’ll try to listen to it and imbibe those qualities within you yourselves. And each one of you can give realization to so many people. You are all very intelligent. So any other thing you have to discuss [you tell Me that thing]. You think they know where I am coming now definitely?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother. But You see [unclear].

Shri Mataji: Now all of you should verify against each back. We’ll form a row. You know this is truth. [Incarnation] is here. [Stay back]. And all of you should discuss [that for instance] about the [guests] when I am coming, what you are doing, what kind of posters you are putting and... How is that, the poster?

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, may I show You, please? Because he says [unclear] except from Matin and with Your blessings I don’t know why I feel that way but [unclear].

Shri Mataji: And they have already given you such a lot of posters? [What they have done?]

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, that’s another one. This is to use only for library, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Library?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it is the one from England. It’s good only for library. It’s not, it’s not catching up on the wall. For the wall we have got a nicer one in colors. But I think this picture is marvelous.

Shri Mataji: How is vibrations?

Sahaja Yogi: It’s, it’s, this is too much, Mother. Because it’s very beautiful also. You could also watch the work of that. They come in.

Shri Mataji: You’ll work it out.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, we will, we will work it out. Matin.

Shri Mataji: Matin loves this. Is Matin who’s done this?

Sahaja Yogini: She has to move.

Shri Mataji: It’s like that miracle [unclear].

Sahaja Yogi: Can you show to Shri Mataji the one with the light?

Sahaja Yogis: No, no [not this one].

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, so it’s there. It’s fantastic. I’m going to put all over the place, specially on the way to my office so that I will enjoy everyone [admiring it]. Very good, very good. It is remarkable, Shri Mataji. I found this very [unclear], remarkable. And at that time someone said that people [unclear] and that’s very unique.

Sahaja Yogini: A lightening here. They had some lighting here, next to the sea.

Sahaja Yogi: They had a lightening in the, the day when it was Mahashivaratri. It’s incredible.

Shri Mataji: This is also something unique, I must say.

Sahaja Yogi: This one is also something unique.

Shri Mataji: It’s because of other people, you see, it is there [unclear]. Do you see the light there?

Sahaja Yogi: There is a fire.

Shri Mataji: It’s a fire. OK?

Sahaja Yogi: Was it a fire, Shri Mataji? I don’t know. [Could it be].

Sahaja Yogini: Shri Mataji, You are giving blessings to the fire and You cleanse people then.

Shri Mataji: You have to come.

Sahaja Yogini: If I will come that close to Shri Shiva.

Sahaja Yogi: That it will work [in time] but [unclear].

Shri Mataji: And how [many of you are going to] America? Did you see [unclear name]? [He/She]’s very relaxed. Any other problem you have?

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, should I [want and pray] that You should come to the Krishna Puja in New York?

Shri Mataji: Of course, this Puja [we’ll have].

Sahaja Yogini: Everything we have [shifted].

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogini: We’ve been shifted.

Shri Mataji: How far is that?

Sahaja Yogi: Quite far that people say...

Sahaja Yogini: Seven, eight hours.

Shri Mataji: [Cause I don’t know this place]. Because [you still you have come such a way]. It is time. What’s your full name?

Sahaja Yogini: [Doris].

Shri Mataji: But your name is what?

Sahaja Yogini: [Iphydrine]

Sahaja Yogi: Doris [Iphydrine]. Her husband is from Turkey.

Shri Mataji: [Iphy]?

Sahaja Yogi: [Iphydrine]. Her husband is from Turkey.

Shri Mataji: That’s why. Somebody told Me it is [Iphydrine], I said, “Let’s see. At least we can talk to this gentleman.” I must say, he’s done tremendous work. He decorated the whole place very well. He did so much of organizing; so much he did that. I was really amazed how she could be. So she’s come now only, very recently and how to create such a [stout] time. Actually they don’t understand [unclear]. As a Sahaja Yogi [unclear] these days who are doing [unclear] no good. [unclear]. Not complying to you but I must have seen her before when she’s get her realization in [Nasik]. And she’s done so much. I mean, she’s surprising. Normally you don’t find her, as others judging everyone, and how it goes, how it goes and not [fighting each other]. But this one is so straightforward. I mean, there’s something great about [unclear], why she’s done so much, and she takes to Sahaja Yoga so straightforward and it’s so much, you cannot imagine. This leadership, to organize everything, arrange everything, even decorated My bathroom. I mean, every sort of things she has worked out. And [she seems to] many people like an Indian. “You should have faith in Me; I am an Indian.” That’s how I feel after I see this picture and the place [unclear] predicted about. That’s the thing [unclear] person is, then [unclear]. [missing part]
