1980-01-29, Seminar for the new Sahaja yogis Day 2, Cowasji Jehangir Hall, Mumbai

[Hindi to English translation]

Yesterday I explained to you the purpose for which you have come into this world. Why did the Supreme Soul create humans with such effort? And what is the use of this human? For this, the Supreme Soul has arranged within us a system that is extremely beautiful. And with great effort and meticulous planning, this arrangement was made. And all the preparations were gathered inside. But when freedom was given to humans, when humans raised their heads and became complete human beings, they also attained their freedom. Within them were both powers that I explained yesterday, the powers of Ida and Pingala. Ida from which our existence, our existence is formed, and Pingala from which we create, become creative. Due to the functioning of both these powers, within us, the mind and intellect or mind and ego, named two institutions, have been formed. These institutions, if you see, are like two balloons in the head. Which will be shown to you here. These two balloons have been formed inside us, which are called ego and super ego in English. These institutions, due to being densely packed there, the ones at the junction of the two .. when... become completely covered overlapping the soft bone, called fontanels bone, have been completely surrounded by calcium, meaning calcified. Meaning the soft bone that was there has become completely hard. Because of this, you are Mister this, you are Mrs. that, you are Miss that. It is because of this that the ego, the 'I', 'I am this, I am that', all of this will come. Because all of you have become separate from that omnipresent power. Before this, whatever evolution you went through, from being a carbon atom to becoming a human, whatever evolution you underwent, it continued on its own and did not happen in your consciousness. It did not happen in your conscious mind. I'll use English words intermittently. So even those who don't understand Hindi very well will be able to understand. In the conscious mind, meaning in your alert consciousness, this idea did not come to you of how you evolved from an amoeba to a human. You did not know this. This happened unknowingly. But what lies ahead, the pedestal of evolution, what you have to attain next, it was necessary for you to know that. If you didn't know this, you wouldn't know the Supreme Soul, nor His effort, nor His power. Nor could you implement that power. When you arrived in this state, in this maturity, in this security, only then will you receive that position which you will understand in your alertness. You will understand it from your conscious mind. You will come to know that we are something else. Something has changed within us and that's why freedom has been given to you. This freedom is given because you first teach a child in mathematics, that two plus two is four. Then you give him a question. He is told to find the answer to the question. We have given you this question. We have asked you these questions. Solve this question. Similarly, the Supreme Soul has given you freedom so that you can solve the question of life with your own intellect. Every human has intellect. Intellect is present in every human being. By birth, intellect is already present in them. However, humans lose it in their freedom. Intellect exists within you, and when you explore something in your freedom with intellect, when you search for something in your freedom, then upon having intellect, you stay balanced in the middle path, which we call the Sushumna path. This leads to the manifestation of the parasympathetic nervous system. Now, those who are unfamiliar with this intellect, or those who have surrendered it, have gone beyond this wisdom. They tend to lean heavily towards the right-hand side or towards the left-hand side. Now, towards this left-hand side is our past. Our past, our history, lies towards the left-hand side. Everything we have done so far is all on our left side. It's all in our Ida Nadi. This is how that institution is formed, which we call either the mind or the super ego. You must have heard many times, "My mind doesn't want it." What is this mind? This mind is not you; this mind exists. People say, "My mind doesn't want to do it." Childhood-embedded conditioning, ingrained mental exploitations from childhood, and all the experiences from past lives are all seated in your left side. Alright, all kinds of good and bad are seated on your left side. And your future is on your right-hand side. On the right-hand side, you think about the future, what to do, what not to do, planning, doing this, going there, meeting this, all of this happens on your right-hand side. Similarly, worrying about our body. How will our body stay fine? The pains in the body, and any impending deaths, all of these are on the right-hand side. From the Sushumna to the right, which is the central channel, is your present, meaning the present. I tell you to stop right now, to pause right here. But it can't happen. Realized souls might, others can't stop because a thought arises, that it will end. You can see it rise, but you can't see it fall. Another thought arises that it also falls. The space between these two, that delay, is the present. The rising thought has risen and fallen, it has gone into the past, it has gone into the past, and the thought that is about to come is prepared for the future. It is in your future, in the future. But the little space between these, which is called delay, that space, that is the present, and it is so tiny in every human that a thought comes into one's mind and he jumps to the next, jumps to the third, jumps to the fourth, just keeps jumping all the time. Therefore, it cannot descend within, and this very thing, when the Kundalini rises upwards, it squeezes both the mind and the ego in such a way, both these things, all of a sudden, as if air escapes from a balloon, they shrink, and as a result, our delay is established. Therefore, we can become thoughtless. Those who transcended here yesterday, who felt cool breeze from their hands, they became thoughtless.

But we cannot stop at this thoughtlessness. Because our habits are deeply ingrained. Our ways have been going on for years. We cannot let go of them easily. Even after coming into the new world, we still cannot completely break away from our old world. Although the relationship has ended, it still sits in the mind. For example, consider that a man who lives in the city, when he goes to the village, he starts driving as he does in the city. Then he is told, "Hey, the road here is bad. Don't drive the car like this, or it will be ruined. You'll have to drive it carefully." But he still forgets. It has become a habit of his mind. Therefore, mental habits work on you. Therefore, I told you yesterday that even if you have crossed over, you still need to take some time out for meditation, so that your thoughtlessness is established. First, you have to establish delay. Now, when this delay is established, this is the place from where the kingdom of the Supreme Being begins. Just as you think, the mouth of power, as long as you don't give grain to the mouth of power, it won't come out in any way, it will just spread here and there above. Similarly, understand thoughtlessness as the face of the kingdom of God. If you put it in there, all the work will be done, and you will get prepared work with its processing. That means there is such tremendous power of the Supreme Being. If you have any questions, a gentleman has just arrived here. He lives in Mauritius. He's a very renowned scientist. He did his doctorate. He worked hard for many years. Somehow, he couldn't pass his doctorate. The topic he had chosen was very beautiful, 'What effect does alcohol have on us?' He said, 'Mother, I lost. They didn't even look at me.' I said, 'Okay, bring your thesis to me.' He brought it. I didn't read it or anything. I said, 'There's no time right now. I just lifted it and offered it into that power.' And you'll be surprised that the next day he became a doctor. The very next day. Not a single word of this is false. An attempt should be made to put it at the mercy of that power. By doing it, it becomes a habit. Then we say, "Alright, leave it to God." No matter how much work you do, but if it's not left to God, then its result may come from anywhere and go anywhere. When you get lost in thoughts, you remain engaged in activities. It is for this reason that when humans attain their freedom, they start two things. In the beginning, he started saying, "Don't do this, don't do that. Don't go here, don't go there." Especially in Western countries, it's very common. Maintain discipline. If you have to go in the morning, wear something gray, if you have to go at night, wear black. If you want to drink alcohol, drink it from this bottle, bring a separate glass for it. Keep such spoons with it. Along with it, you should wear such clothes. It has no end. He seemed to have gone crazy. He made everything in such a way that people would go crazy, it became a disaster. If there is something, bring a separate platter for it, bring something separate for it. In our country... (unclear) there is a lot of this.

That is, praying to God. Devoting oneself to God, we have left aside His rituals around the world. And we have made such foolishness in our country too, that there is no limit to it. Let me give you an example, like, there is a crisis at home. The day Lord Ganesha is born. Fast on that day. Now tell me, if there is a child born in your house, will you fast? Keep a vow. Observe mourning. There should be a rethinking. A person should think, will we do it this way? If a child is born in our house, we will celebrate, play drums that day, feed sweets to people. We will have a great time, host a feast. And when Lord Ganesha is born, you are fasting. These strange things, like going to temples. There are Brahmins sitting in the temple. They are all 420, all confirmed. It's known, they have no character, nothing. Go in front of them, touch their feet. They are not even worth the dust on your feet, yet you sit in the temple to touch their feet. Apply tikka, wake up at four in the morning to disturb everyone. Shout, scream. Create all kinds of trouble in the name of religion. In every religion. Which religion hasn't had spectacles? May God save the Jain religion. In the Jain religion, whatever show-business they have done, may God save them. A big Jain monk came to me. I said, 'Brother, what are you guys doing?' Give money to wave his ‘Chanvar’ and to stand behind the statue. Give money for this, give money for that. Is this anyway? They say, when there's a wedding, the groom comes in the procession, so give money for his horse. Give money for his car. You're giving money for everything related to God like this. Strange things like these have been created in the name of our religion. Even more destruction in the Christian religion! Don't ask anything. First, you should know, the Pope had issued permits for moths, etc., take this, take that, and issue permits. It's still going on, everything is about money. Wherever you go, there's money involved, and doing such things. Then you know, becoming a nun. Then cutting their hair. Then causing pain to their bodies in every way. Who told you to do this? There are many like this even here. Some have become nuns. Some have become monks. Some are standing on one leg, some are standing on their heads. Is this a way to please God, you tell me! If your own son did this in front of you, you would die of distress. What has happened to them? Why are they doing this? Who told you to torture yourself like this, to be distressed day and night? Here among Muslims, they whip themselves, scream, shout. Who told them to do this? Such drama, in the name of religion, countless have occurred! There is no limit to absurdities. So there was a reaction. When foolishness reached its limit, there was a reaction. Psychologists come. They consider themselves very intelligent. In our Marathi, we say, 'Smart on an ostrich.' They began to explain, "Sir, this is not right. You are conditioning, conditioning. You are giving away your entire personality. Don't do this, don't do that. How will your liberation be? You are all inhibited. Your condition is bad inside, that condition is bad." Come on, sir, this ride is over and another ride has begun.

Now they boarded another ride. On one hand, they prepared such a distorted mind in the name of religion, in the name of discipline. By doing things from all over the world, such distortion has come into people. So much distortion has come, exactly what is called unnatural. Artificial, completely artificial things have come. And on the other side, what they started saying was, "Sir, nothing matters. There's nothing called the name of God. There is no one. We don't care. If there's a twelve-year-old child, parents don't care. If parents have another child, they'll put the first one in another room. Women are free. Men are free. What freedom is this, and from whom? You are parts of one body. How can you be free? Just snap my finger and tell me I'm free." So what does this mean? This finger, is it a dead finger? You will only be free when you recognize the power within which you reside. Recognize the power that sustains you. But what happened? First, you destroyed yourself in the name of religion. And now, on the other hand, destruction has begun again in the name of religion. Blind faith has been nurtured with such foolishness. After that, such great foolishness has begun on the other side, that there is no God at all. Those who were actually there have been defamed. People say that even Jesus Christ wasn't there, and those who were, they weren't proper people. What kind of limit is this? You are not even equal to the dust on their feet. How can you judge them? But who will speak? Because they are riding on the horse of ego. You must have seen that when a person becomes arrogant, his head gets spoiled. There is a story. Some villagers went to meet a minister. The minister's peons were flaunting their pride. So the poor villagers couldn't understand, and they said, "Sir, why are you behaving so badly?" They started saying, "You don't know I'm a peon." They said, "You should have told us first that you are drunk." So we don't even come before you." So someone whose ego rises is like a drunkard. He just can't understand that if he has power, he feels like he's moving faster than a horse. The horse is left behind, but they keep running without the horse. You must have seen examples of strange madness. I don't need to tell you. When a person talks on the phone, it becomes immediately evident where they stand. In the way they speak, in everything they say, their ego hits so hard that they don't even realize it. The ego in you people hasn't reached the level of arrogance yet, as much as we have seen in Westerners. Their arrogance is so deeply ingrained in them that even an ordinary labourer speaking in this manner makes you wonder, "Which mental asylum is he coming from?" There, humility is something no one seems to know about. From morning till evening, they indulge only in abusive language and chaos; there is no meaningful conversation. At least in our country, there is civility. At least people speak with decorum, if nothing else. That's why I'm speaking in Marathi, Hindi; they won't listen. Although they themselves say it. They tell me, 'Mother, we already have an ego inside us. Are we not some Napoleon born in the first place?' So it should be understood that on one hand, we have moved on, on one side.

In superstition and on the other hand, we got carried away in arrogance. Both are far from reality. Everything that is far, that is the essence, the principle, is in between. The backbone of our spine is also in between. To remain in between, in moderation, there is strength in that itself. Even if our hand breaks, it won't matter much, but if our backbone breaks, we can't survive. That's why when a person goes to extremes, now if they start running for money, they run for money. Hey brother, doesn't this have any limit? After all, what do you want to buy? Do you want to buy a helicopter? If you chase after money to the extent of selling the country, there's no harm. Money is there, money commands respect. And there's no respect without money. Everyone knows that any such person, who is like this, is only respected to his face. As soon as his back is turned, I have seen, people are talking behind his back, saying, "He's a big thief. He was released from jail the day before yesterday." The person who respects money is limited to that extent. No one respects the dignity within you. Your respect is only for external things. What is inside you? Your dignity is in your own home. If you have respect in your own home, then why are you selling yourself for money? You are a human being, a man, a very noble thing. Money is just dust. Money is nothing. And this money doesn't even tolerate you. If you have a hundred rupees, it's okay to say, but if you get two hundred, then you're in trouble.’ If you don't go into trouble, you start some other business. Too much money is unbearable for a person. I have never heard of anyone getting a lot of money and immediately thinking, "Let me go and do some great work with this, or let me go to the house of a poor person and take care of his daughter or child." Very few. Even those who do so, meaning they have millions of rupees, will take out a penny and give it, saying, "Make sure my name is printed there." I often get people saying, "We will give money for your ashram, but write my father's name there." I said, "What will I write your father's name for? People will ask, what was the spiritual value of that man?" Your spiritual value should be seen. Where your spiritual essence has awakened is important. When you come to your spiritual essence, then you run after money like crazy. And you know that money can never provide a solution. This is something written in economics. It's written in economics that money cannot give you a solution. So, respect your reality. Respect what is based within you, the gift of the divine. And then you cannot go to any extreme. Behind power, nowadays you are seeing in your country, people are not showing any kind of stability. Because they don't have any confidence in themselves. They also don't understand what to do. They are confused. Their base... is no longer there. No principles remain with them. Because they have strayed far from their principles. And to stray from those principles, they don't feel any anxiety. Because their arrogance is complete within them. Many people take advantage of this.

In this way, many people take advantage of those who are wavering. Now you may say, "Mother, nowadays everyone in our country has become like this. Everyone's only concern is arrogance, it has escalated so much that people don't trust any principles anymore." If they don't, they will suffer. Those who do not believe in their principles will suffer. Everyone has endured. And those who don't endure will suffer everything. Hitler thought he would make the world dance to his tune. In that era, he felt that whatever he did was right. He endured, his entire country endured, and they are still enduring. Therefore, remember, I would rather say, son, endure. It's better if I say, enjoy the happiness you have. Your principles are also a matter of pride; it's pride for a person to stand by their principles. What greater pride can there be than this? If you don't have four cars, what difference does it make? What will you lose from it? But at least in the world, people say that they are principled. They are considered principled in the world. Thousands of such beetles are born and die. If you are truly a human being, then you should stay true to your principles. If you stay true to your principles, then many people also get confused, thinking that they have become highly principled. So they think about imposing their authority on everyone. Being principled means they think waking up at four in the morning is a great act of principle. These are not such principles. Principles come from deep within. It's about understanding. The greatest principle is love. Love is the highest thing. And those who do not recognize this principle keep chasing after the superficial principles that make you oppress the necks of people all over the world. You have to fast, keep fasting. Why have you made the whole world into scouts? Why have you made everyone choke ... around you? Here, too, many people have emerged who will make everyone's life difficult. In Sahaja Yoga, you should remain natural. Natural means just as you are. No one should make you uncomfortable. It is not necessary for you to act like a monkey. Or it is not necessary for you to roam around like a heavy Englishman. You are Indian. Stay in the Indian way. Indian humans should stay as they are. How should you stay like your being... (unclear) ...? Is it difficult? Now what happened to those people? They went to extremes. Now another extreme has begun. People there have stopped wearing clothes. As much as they glorified clothing, now as a result, they say, "Come on, wear torn clothes." You must know that torn clothes are exported from here to there. There are such big patches, they are considered very good there. That's why ... those who go to extremes ... have exaggerated with themselves. Now many people think that work is everything. I work a lot. Working is good, but one should also remember God. Attention should also be paid to one's soul. People who are stubborn like oxen are useless for Sahaja Yoga. There is no need to be stubborn like oxen. Alright, work on time. And spend some time with your wife, children, everyone. Also spend time with them. You also have a responsibility towards them. There is no need to burden yourself with a heavy schedule by ruining their lives. .

Neighbours love you the most. You don't have time for love, but you have time to work. And what is the benefit of this work? What is the gain? We have seen many archers in this, who have occupied great positions. When they retire, they end up in obscurity. No one even asks where you are sitting. And those who sang the saga of love, people remember them to this day. You know many examples like this, as many sadhus and saints have become, no matter how poor they are, people come to pay their respects to them. And those who considered themselves rich and mighty, and who caused havoc in the world, where are they today, lying in which field, and where are they covered in dust, rotting away? No one even knows where they have gone? If at least someone knew, they wouldn't go there. "Oh dear, that demon is sleeping there. Let's go from here." But those who have loved the world, those who have given love, in each and everything of such people, in each and every sentence of theirs, there is so much sweetness that wherever it is found, people catch hold of it. You too. When you know that from the heart, you respect such things. You respect a person from the heart just like that. Then you should also respect yourself. You also have to create your own place. And when this place is established, then you enter into the midst. I mentioned all this because of how many disturbances have occurred here due to going to extremes. You must be aware of it. Now there are many types in this, such as when you get into collective subconsciousness. You worship God excessively. Day and night, it's all about God, God. You have no authority. From morning till evening, you sit chanting prayers. Now I told you just yesterday, brother, that chanting prayers is not everyone's right. It shouldn't be done. It takes a lot of urging to keep God in your heart and to remember Him. Then a relationship is formed with Him. And if you keep chanting His name like this, what will happen? Only one thing will happen, and that is, if God or someone similar doesn't come, but if you keep chanting the name of Ram, some ghost will enter your head. Many people have told me, "Mother, I was sitting. I was worshiping God. The garland slipped from my hand and landed around God's neck." I said, "Does God have nothing else to do?" Then, as they kept advancing, such fake gurus emerged. They started saying, "I went to him. He told me where my father has buried his treasure." I said, "Do you think God keeps track of all these things for you? And where has your father buried treasure for you?" Four people hang their heads in shame. Then they said, "No, he told me a number. I asked, 'What?' He said, 'He told me the horse's number, and that horse came.'" "And they call it the work of God," I said, "they have really degraded God's dignity." Then they said, "They also tell the number for betting and the number for gambling." In this way, as we keep falling, we end up falling to where? We think of God, but we start asking for the number of our horse. In the name of God, we commit thousands of sins, and there are big guns standing at their places. You must have seen it.

In that, especially in our Maharashtra, it is said that the Goddess inhabits the bodies of women. Are there any other dealings for the goddesses to come into these mediums? Although they continue to scrub vessels all over the world, the goddess has entered within them. People go to touch her feet. All these foolish acts are done because of the stupidity and blindness of our left side. From morning till evening. If you say, "Brother, go, if you want to go to the temple, go ahead. Touch the idol there and come back." They won't agree to it. They will only bring back prasad from there. Who knows how some filthy person made it? What is their heart like? They will say after eating it, "Ah, I had prasad," and then straight to the doctor. And the people from the right side keep going out, may God save them. Ego is such a thing that the person himself doesn't understand. He will keep doing foolish things, acting stupidly. But he won't realize that he is foolish. Then the world will spit on him and laugh. There is a place named,  (unclear). The kings there are so foolish. They are black and they make shoes out of pearls. They keep doing strange things. Amin Sahab is one. Very intelligent. But he thinks he is so intelligent that who can explain to him? He is riding on a horse! An arrogant person is very difficult to correct. Because his ego, he thinks, 'This is who I am.' And those who nurture this arrogance have also been born. They will teach you something or the other, like, 'Yes brother, come to me, I'll make everything in your father's name.' I'll give your name as Bhoganand, Dhonganand, Kharabanand. The poor English people don't know anything, whatever names you give them. Just now a gentleman was telling me that he gave 600 pounds to a gentleman, that he gave him a mantra. What mantra did he give? 'Aenga'. 600 hundred pounds. And to another he gave 'Tinga'. Now one... The Indian understands that poor things, they don't know anything, they are foolish. He gave them the 'Tinga' mantra. He made you wear clothes. He took off your clothes, saying something here, something there. Wear this rosary, do this, do that. Poor things have become fools. Now, in the whirlwind of arrogance, they don't understand that, brother, will you attain the divine by wearing a rosary? Kabir has said, 'Examine the desires of the mind, the mind's desires...' Were they all fools, Nanak Ji and others? Are they all speaking lies? Was Tukaram completely wrong? Was Gyaneshwar completely wrong? Then where did these teachings come from? They say in Marathi, "Upatsunbha!" You start listening to their words because you are caught up in the right side. Then someone comes and talks to you. They mess up your mind. They describe you exactly like this, they praise your actions. They shower so much love on you. You will completely... like falling on the ground, you won't even realize. Your neck will be cut. What will people who get caught in such foolishness achieve in finding the divine? Here's the thing, you have to attain the divine. Here you have to summon the divine. You have to invoke them. You have to seat them in your heart. You have to say to them, "Lord, forgive us for all our faults, and awaken in our hearts." Another thing here is that there is no shop where you decide whether to give or not. No one has given you money that we will give. People come like this, standing with sticks, saying, "You are like our mother, so you should give us." Why don't you give?" "If we want to give, we will; if not, we won't. You can't force us." The reason is not that they don't want to give. But when it's not meant to happen, it won't, and when it's meant to happen, it will. What can be done about it! If a seed sprouts on its own, it does; if it doesn't, it doesn't. You know that no one can force it to sprout from above forcibly; it can only be pulled out from within. Will anyone pull your Kundalini? Whatever you have done, whatever you have managed your health, according to that, your Kundalini awakens. In this way, the two powers within you, Ida and Pingala, flow. Its flow is named, you can say, the power of Mahakali. There is no name for this in English. This power of Mahakali runs in your left side. It is called "Holy Ghost" in English. It is from this same power of Mahakali that other powers emerge. This is the ultimate power. From this, the other powers emerge, which we call the power of Mahasaraswati. Through this, we think, contemplate, and discuss future matters. Due to the wrong use of these two powers, dense bubbles of ego and counter-ego form within us, becoming these bubbles in our heads. Or it should be said that two dense entities like balloons are formed. And due to this reason, Kundalini does not rise because when your head is completely covered in this way suddenly, either one has pulled more or the other has pulled more, then the middle cannot be made. Kundalini stays in place. But the common Kundalini rises, you saw it yesterday. That's why I was telling you to apologize yesterday. Forgiveness is the treatment for ego. If you get angry, as soon as you get angry, say one word, sorry. Someone says, very hot-tempered. Too much, they say, he gets angry at the drop of a hat. Here your anger sits on top of your nose. Such a person should do this, that when you get angry, you say to it, hold on, hold on, hold on. Tell him three times. Or you can say to him, what did you say, what did you say, what did you say? And then after that, say sorry. Try and see, your anger will decrease. But there is no need to wrestle with anger forcibly. There is no need to struggle with anger. The man in whom anger is suppressed, whether it has come out or not, who has a habit of getting angry, it means his ego is corrupted. His ego is troubled. Therefore, a person should first forgive himself and then forgive others. Therefore, forgiveness is a very big tool given by God, by which we overcome our ego. Now, what is the way to win our mind? Firstly, through forgiveness, we can conquer our ego, and the way to win our mind is that when the mind desires to see something excessively, when it craves something excessively, at that point, we should tell our mind, "Is it foolishness that you are stuck on?" Then the attraction of the mind will end. The habits of the mind will be broken. The best way to break habits is to say to the thing that the mind desires a lot, "Alright, you stay put. We have seen enough of you." But

It's not like that. Most people will say, "Brother, I only eat pure ghee and nothing else. I, brother, that's how I am, I should have the best food." Here, people are more inclined towards food. In our country, there is a disease of indulgence in food and drink. From morning till evening, the concern is about what you are eating. Is God going to reward you for eating? Brother, you eat this, they eat that, you have a liking for this food. Today, I want Puranpoli. How foolish it is to boast about such things! "I like this, I like that." What elegance is there in saying such things with your tongue? And you will say such things too, which make others think that I have become wealthy. Seeing this, I am amazed that this is also something to brag about, my son. This is also something to say with your own mouth. In the eyes of the Almighty, what are all these things? You tell me. Stand in the place of the Almighty and listen, if someone tells you, 'I have a liking for this. I have a liking for that. That is good.' This kind of boasting, from trivial matters to significant ones, 'My mother serves very good food. That's my pleasure. From foolish talks to big ambitions, 'I have a liking for cars. I have a liking for power. I will become the Prime Minister. I have a liking for this. That's my liking.' If you have interests from all over the world, then stay at home. In the kingdom of the Almighty, there is no place for such enthusiasts. Excessive indulgence beyond necessity does not adorn a human being. It's only humans who do it, not animals, poor things." "He falls asleep anywhere. He wakes up anywhere. In my opinion, even the saints end up in the same situation. If you tell someone to sleep anywhere, they'll fall asleep. If all the comfort is inside, then what's the need for all these things outside? But until that state doesn't come, there's no need to force too much with oneself. Because if I say one thing, you'll do another. If I say, 'Son, don't rest too much,' you'll say, 'Alright, from today, Mother said we'll sleep on the ground.' You'll sleep on the roadside. I said, 'Brother, sleeping on the road is not good.' So you'll sleep in the palaces. I mean stay in between, I'm telling you this. Not staying in between leads to a kind of foolishness in humans. And there is so much privilege and so much elevation that he doesn't even understand what's fun in it? He keeps looking at everything with disdain." "His whole life is a big swing, stability is not achieved. And until stability is not achieved, no matter how much joy fills you from within, you don't experience any joy. These are both extreme things I've told you, that when a person indulges in ego, even the ghosts of ego possess him. How arrogant people can be in the world, that even when they die, their pride doesn't leave them. They think, 'Sir, I haven't done anything insignificant.' Such people can also infiltrate your mind. They too can enter into you. If you engage in such discussions, people will say, 'This wasn't like this before.' What happened to them? So a person should strive to remain normal. He should remain in between. A person who remains in between is completely balanced with both powers." If a person works too much, is overly arrogant, then he will have a heart attack. If there is no heart attack, then he will get diabetes. If there is no diabetes, then there will be kidney disease.

It will go on; liver disease will occur, and more diseases can happen to him. Because the functions of our Svadhisthana Chakra continue. Their biggest task is that for the intellect we have, for the work happening in it, there is fat. Deliver this fat to the cells. Supply it. Fat cells should not be under-supplied. Now, consider this, if you see one task, think, think, think about the other tasks it has, which are the pancreas, liver, kidneys, spleen, etc., you cannot see them. Then you get the disease of diabetes. In Sahaj Yoga, we cure diabetes a hundred percent. If you get realized and listen to us. Your diabetes, kidneys, everything can be cured a hundred percent. If you once put your kidney in a machine, then we cannot fix it. And for that, please forgive us. Once something goes into the machine, it perishes. We cannot fix it, so what's the point of getting angry about it? We will try, but what's the use of troubling ourselves in vain? Now, within us, there is the second chakra, the Svadhisthana Chakra, about which I have explained. Above this chakra is the Nabhi Chakra, which houses the principle of Lakshmi. Lakshmi resides there. And you know, Lakshmi is not just about money. The nature of Lakshmi is such, as I have explained many times. If you read about it, you will understand that there is a big difference between Lakshmi and money. The biggest thing is that a Lakshmipati, who is one with wealth, is very content from within. He gives to others and shelters many people. He who is adorned with garments like a lotus, and who is extremely warm and fragrant like a lotus from the heart, when this principle of Lakshmi awakens within us, when the Kundalini releases the principle of Lakshmi, then all our material concerns are dispelled. Now, material concerns do not mean that if you want to become Ambani or Tata, then that will never happen to you. Go ask them about their condition. But your financial situation improves. The main reason for this is that when the principle of Lakshmi awakens, all your dirty habits go away. Alcohol will leave on its own. Your tobacco addiction will disappear. Whatever addictions you have, they will all vanish. Whatever such things are, for which money is wasted, all of that will disappear. Because you are sitting in enjoyment. Secondly, because of the principle of Lakshmi, you will be able to understand what is real and what is fake. There was a gentleman whose financial condition was very bad. He came to me. He asked, 'What work should I do?' 'Whatever work you do, you have become awakened.' 'You work with wood.' He said, 'I have never even seen wood.' I said, 'Just start.' Gradually, he realized through vibrations how to make progress in this work? How to proceed? And he earned quite a bit of money. He earned as much as an expert. Many people should meet such a person. In this way, everyone's Lakshmi principle becomes right. In our London, there are many people who have benefited greatly from the principle of Lakshmi. Those who did not have a house suddenly got a house. Those who did not have food to eat, got a job. Some... or the other arrangements were made. Various kinds of assistance were provided. And in this way, people benefited from the principle of Lakshmi. Now, when the principle of Lakshmi awakens within you, after the awakening of Kundalini, then when-ever you touch anything, understand that it's like a tree that is dying. If you touch it, even the principle of Lakshmi will awaken within it. That tree will become valuable. Meaning, fruits will grow on that tree that will be very valuable. Not only that, imagine I have a stone. One of our Australian disciples told me, "Mother, this is an Australian opal." It was completely white. I said, "I don't usually take things." She said, "Mother, from our side, from Australia's side, please take it." So, I took the gold and had it set in the stone. Since started wearing it, its colors changed completely. Twenty-five colors are visible in it. She also wondered where so many colors came from? It only had a white color. If such a person wears pearls, the value of pearls may change. The value of the house where he lives may change. Because the entire environment keeps changing. When the principle of Lakshmi comes, consider this: if there is a house that sells for twenty rupees, if a saint resides there, then the same house will sell for twenty thousand. You will be amazed. There is an attraction in it. There is a pull, a uniqueness. Because this principle is so effective that we don't even know about it. Let me give you a concrete example of this. When Shastri Ji passed away, the items associated with his death, which we call ashes, were taken in large pots, and people carried them. The pots were kept in the train. Wherever they went, the entire path, all the way to Banaras, there was no place where people were not standing. Even at night, everyone stood with lanterns. From here to there, everywhere, even for miles, people were standing. Only those pots were visible. Shastri Ji himself was not visible. People bowed to him. Then when they went to Banaras and dedicated the ashes in the Ganges, after that, no one even asked, "Where are those pots?" No one even looked in that direction. No one thought, "Where are those pots?" They were silver pots. They could have gotten lost somewhere. So no one knew where the pots were. They had fallen somewhere. Someone picked it up and said, "The pot was lying here." When the element inside it was gone, what meaning remained in it? So stay true to your principles. And this chakra that exists within us keeps the elements awakened. Initially, there is a chakra on your navel. And on this navel chakra, there is your mother's blessing. You are connected to your mother. For a person whose mother is very religious and a good woman without any exaggeration, this is a great blessing for that person. The navel chakra of such a person mostly remains balanced, the one whose mother has given love and affection to her child. And if she has always kept him sad or troubled, then there will be a lot of trouble. If that child is given lots of love and always kept satisfied, then such a Lakshmi chakra awakens very quickly. And sometimes there is a mother who is very religious, very stubborn, and criticizes everything in the world. If she doesn't look after her children, their Sri Chakra can be disturbed. Even if she is wealthy, she will not be the mistress of wealth. Such a person is not balanced. Now even psychologists believe this. A child whose childhood does not go well, that person becomes somewhat abnormal. The chakra ahead of him, what you see around him wide, this is a very important thing. This wide part in our stomach, which is shown here, inside it is the place of Dattatreya Ji. It is the place of the Guru. Inside our stomach is the place of the Guru. Just as we seek from the navel chakra, seek money. Or, whether, first we seek to fill our stomach, then we seek our satisfaction, then after that, if not satisfied then we seek power, seek money, they seek, and then after that, we seek the Guru principle. We search for someone who can lead us across this ocean of existence. In this search, we immerse ourselves. This is the place of Dattatreya Ji. You must have heard of Adinath, Machhindranath. Adinath, whom Jain people also believe in. All avatars are from Adinath to Dattatreya. And these avatars primarily consist of ten avatars that we believe in. But there have been many such avatars. Among these ten avatars is also Muhammad Sahab. Dattatreya is indeed the incarnation of Muhammad Sahab himself. That means we also believe in Sai Baba. Yes, he was also exactly Dattatreya. The Sai Baba of Shirdi was indeed Dattatreya. But if we say that Muhammad Sahab was also Dattatreya, then we won't accept it. After all, Sai Nath was also a Muslim. Then why do you believe in him? They will believe others but not Muhammad Sahab. Muhammad Sahab was also the same. Nanak was also the same. Janak was also the same. They all reside within our consciousness. When a person doubts in it, when they don't see unity in all religions, then they suffer from stomach diseases. Therefore, you should understand what the essence of Dattatreya is. Look, how many disciples of Dattatreya came here yesterday. And even so many disciples of Dattatreya, all of them have stomach ailments. What was the reason? The reason was that Dattatreya was neither Hindu nor Muslim. He was beyond religion. He had no religion at all. He transcended religion. He created a religion that is created by itself. How can this be possible? Until this sentiment is fully awakened within us. Sai Nath has said, criticizing any religion is a great sin. But how many disciples of Sai Nath believe in this? And this is the guru principle within us that we should know. And as I told you, like Moses, Abraham, they were all born from the same guru principle. And this guru principle is also present within us. By awakening this guru principle, we ourselves become our own guru. This happens through the awakening of Kundalini within us. The next chakra after that, which you see above, is called the heart chakra. I'll explain quickly because time is short. Tomorrow we have to take another subject. This is the heart chakra. In the heart chakra, the space in between is the place of Jagadamba. She is the mother of the universe, her place is there. It's the place of Durga Ji. When a person feels insecure, when they feel unsafe, then this chakra grips them. Many women who suffer from diseases like breast cancer are affected by the malfunctioning of this chakra. If they feel insecure about themselves, then you see, the person they are with is on the wrong path. Or they have no place to go. The children are not well.

Due to feeling insecure, they experience this illness. Fearful women can have this disease. This chakra becomes defective for them, who feel insecure about themselves. When Kundalini is awakened, Jagadamba awakens within you, and she protects you. There are many ways she protects, like when you are going somewhere. As you go, suddenly you see there's an accident. But because you're leaving, the accident will be averted. If you're on that train and you're realized souls, the entire train will be saved. Not a single person will be harmed. Many have experienced this. You should also observe it. Therefore, it's necessary that your heart chakra be healed. Those whose heart chakra is not healed can suffer from many diseases, such as severe bronchitis. severe cough. All this happens through this chakra, through the union of this chakra. Now, on the right-hand side, the chakra shown here. In that chakra, there is the place of Shri Ram. When this chakra of ours gets defective, Shri Ram's chakra, Shri Ram is the epitome of righteousness. As soon as we break our boundaries, meaning, if we are bathing at any time, like fools. Has not this breaking the boundaries. In London, all the Indian people are addicted of bathing at eight-thirty in the morning and they will leave for the office. There, lung cancer is prevalent. It happens due to the breakdown of this chakra. This is Shri Ram's chakra, and its breakdown causes diseases like respiratory problems, and so on. There are many limitations to it. You have to maintain the boundaries of cold and heat. You have to maintain the boundaries of politics. Everything is Shri Ram's... The surprising thing is that those who take the name of Shri Ram always have this chakra malfunctioning. Because Shri Ram is displeased with them. Day and night, you engage his head. Someone is bound to get angry! You can also awaken such a chakra, and even asthma of 30 to 35 years can be cured. If this chakra of yours gets corrected. If your father suddenly dies, and you are affected by it, it also reflects through this. If there is something wrong with you due to being a father, it also shows through this. Most lung diseases occur by catching the right-side chakra, by catching the heart's right side. Now, above that chakra, here is the Vishuddhi Chakra. This chakra is behind us here. This Vishuddhi Chakra, we call it the cervical plexus, looks at it. Now, there are sixteen plexuses in it. Meaning, it has sixteen petals. Your eyes, nose, mouth, throat, and lips, all the muscles inside here, tongue, and others, are all controlled by this. This chakra is so important, very crucial. But if someone's Vishuddhi Chakra gets damaged, their shape will deteriorate. His eyes will deteriorate. Meaning, external eyes, such as experiencing burning sensation, redness in the eyes, and so on, all happen due to faults in this chakra. Some people have toothache, it also happens due to faults in this chakra. Some people experience discomfort in their tongue, it also happens due to faults in this chakra. This chakra also has two parts. Left and right. The chakra in the middle is established by Radha-Krishna. Radha-Krishna.

The place of Radha-Krishna is here. And what is on the left is named after their sister, Vishnumaya. Now, when a person thinks in their mind, "No one is worse than me. I committed this sin. I committed that sin." This chakra catches them. When a person's left chakra, the chakra of purity, catches, a major fault arises in it, that he considers himself very guilty. But when he speaks, lightning strikes. He may say only a few words, but they will be very sarcastic, and will cut sharply. He may speak correctly, but always speak with a twist. Because his left side chakra is caught. The right chakra has the place of Vitthal-Rukmani in it. Meaning, when Krishna ruled, that is the right side. When the right side chakra catches, you get physical illnesses like cold and so on. And even in thought, a person can be of the right side, where a kind of ego can also arise. Because when he speaks or does something, so much ego comes in him that its shadow also falls on this chakra. If ego is used while speaking, it also affects this. And for this reason, when this chakra is also corrupted, it also becomes a big flaw. If anything harms this chakra the most, it is cigarettes. Cancer occurs from cigarettes. It causes pain. No matter how much you say, you can't quit smoking. But with Sahaj Yoga, cigarettes suddenly quit. That's why you don't need to make any effort. Suddenly, your cigarette will quit on its own. Quit smoking. This is about this chakra. Now I will tell you about this chakra and that chakra tomorrow. It's getting late. You know that after this, the work takes a lot of time. In this way, you should think about how beautifully the divine has arranged within us. How beautifully he has organized us and how much arrangement he has made. The incarnations we made during the evolution, all those incarnations are in the same way, that in the navel chakra there are Lakshmi-Narayana, and with Lakshmi-Narayana only you come forward, until here, up to the eighth incarnation, after that, the eighth incarnation is of Lord Rama, he is here for you. Meaning, He comes on the right side of the heart. The seventh is, the seventh is of Lord Rama, and the eighth is of Lord Krishna here. In this way, the incarnations that happened during the evolution are the same. The ninth incarnation is here. The tenth incarnation is here. In this way, there are ten incarnations and they are within us. I have already told you about the ninth incarnation, which is Christ. Whom we know by the name Jesus Christ. I will tell you about him tomorrow. And I will tell you about the Sahasrara. In this way, you can see from our chakras, how the Supreme Being has helped us in making us humans from carbon. Many times incarnations have come into the world. And in what way they helped us. And what kind of help they will provide us in the future. Now we will make a little effort for realization. And I hope that even today many people will transcend. Many people transcended yesterday too.
