Babamama: I'll try to explain. It’s so in such a condensed manner, the entire Sahaja concept has been brought out. It's only the promise of the language. I'll try to interpret it in English. It says, "Oh God, in the form of knowledge, you have planted a tree of my wish or desire". We call it Kankavruksha. The best we can say is the tree of my desire.
"And the branches are now blossomed of that tree. And as a result, my mind has now settled down for meditation".
[Babamama speaks with Shri Mataji in Marathi]
Shri Mataji: On these feet there is the glow of ‘Chandra’.
Babamama: On these feet, or on this status,
Shri Mataji: Lotus feet.
Babamama: On the lotus feet, is the glow of both the Sun and the Moon. And the glow is augmenting the lotus feet as though.
[Babamama speaks with Shri Mataji in Marathi]
Shri Mataji: On the lotus feet, the glow of the Sun and the Moon are surrounding the lotus feet.
Babamama: And giving a status.
Shri Mataji: And getting a status.
Babamama: And getting a status. The glow of Sun and Moon are getting a status by remaining on the lotus feet.
"And having done so, then it has penetrated through the Brahmarandhra, that is the fontanel bone. This is addressed to the Divine.
Shri Mataji: That God has broken our Brahmarandhra.
Babamama: [Babamama speaks with Shri Mataji in Marathi]
All right. That, "The God, the divinity himself has now opened up the Brahmarandhra", the fontanel bone area, or the Sahasrara, as we call it. And, as a result, the vibrations have now completely filled the entire environment or the skies.
Shri Mataji: Churning the seven seas.
Babamama: "Having churned the seven rivers,
Shri Mataji: Seas.
Babamama: Or seven seas"
Shri Mataji: Meaning the seven chakras.
Babamama: Or in the seven chakras, then the entire sky or the cosmos has been filled by the essence of this journey, which is again, vibrations.
Shri Mataji: Chaitanya.
Babamama: Or the Chaitanya.
‘Sanskriti, Nangarudvara, Vahe, Dhyamadeva, Aum, Aum’.
"And in this vibration, or through this vibration, is the culture flowing, the culture of the divinity,"
Shri Mataji: Sahaja culture.
Babamama: "Or the culture of Sahaja is flowing. And it is flowing eternally. It is flowing uninterruptedly".
Shri Mataji: [Marathi]
Babamama: Like, when the Kundalini is awakened, the search culture is flowing through that Kundalini. In the same way, he is comparing that, "When the seven seas were churned, the essence of this journey has completely purified the entire cosmos. And as a result, the Sahaj culture can easily be established and can flow into the whole environment, or into the whole air".

Babamama: "Now in order to trace",
Shri Mataji: To find out.
Babamama: "To find out the truth, which is so beautiful, like the Shiva". It says the ‘Shiva Satya Sundar’, that the truth which is so beautiful like the god Shiva, with the power of divine faith or divine surrender. "The equipment that you have for searching this beautiful truth like Shiva, is the divine faith that you have".
"And when you are in this pursuit, you will, if you are having the needed dedication", or we call it the ‘sadhana’ or if you have the needed surrender, in Sahaja language, "then you will be elevated to be the Guru".
Shri Mataji: Ne, ne. [Marathi]
Babamama: "You will be able to reach to the feet, the lotus feet of the Guru, only when you have that dedication and you have that surrender status".
[Conversation in Marathi aside]

Babamama: Then there is a pleading by the poet, he says that, "In the form of knowledge, or the Virata, may I see you manifest it in small atoms, even the smallest particle, molecule, should manifest the Virata. I shall see you even in the smallest of molecules".
‘Shabti yukti namrata deshi le shuh sankar pade.’
Then the poet is praying that, "You give me the power, you give me the mechanism, give me the techniques, and also give me the modesty and the character, the good character which I require and also the determination that I shall never fail in my pursuit of this Virata".
Then he says, ‘Shabti namrata deshi le shuh sankar pade. Then he says, atma jnani nishchaya bana cheetana mai zahade’. Then because of my knowledge within, or because of the light that has been kindled within, and because of my determination, my mind has become ‘cheetana mai’ or has become vibratory or has become awakened.

Shri Mataji: It is in the praise of God, you see, that, "God you have done all these things for me, and I have achieved this beautiful state in myself". You see, all praise of God. And because I cannot translate my own praise, so I preferred him to translate.
[Laughter]
Babamama: And I can assure you I have done a very bad job. Because all the qualities that are there of the Guru, how to bring them into language, because I think the relationship of a Guru and shishya, that is the Master and pupil, is more out of experience rather than out of productions of the mind or mental productions. So, it is extremely difficult to explain to you the tenderness and the affection, and also the discipline which the Master gives to the disciple. It has to be experienced. I am sure you are experiencing it right now.
Okay, now a song which according to Guido is the hit of 1990. I am requesting Anil to come again. I’m sorry. Okay, one song from Sanjay, then after that we will come to the hit song. Of Sanjay, all songs are hits. I did not tell you that.

Not written by Babamama or Belos or Roshan. But there must be another poet who has this sahaj concept. It is a very beautiful song. It is a very slow song, but it has the impact of reaching your heart, and will also bring out the vibratory effect of the song. We will experience it.

Shri Mataji: You see, this song, I used to like very much together, saying to God that, "When I see your eyes full of life, I want to live". And this is, I mean it's really- sometimes I used to get very depressed and unhappy the way things are working out, and sometimes how people used to talk, or there used to be so many negative things that would happen. Then this song used to come back to Me that, "Oh God, your eyes when I see, full of life, I want to live". And it's a beautiful song. It's very encouraging for Me as well as for you.
