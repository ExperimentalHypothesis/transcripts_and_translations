Talk to Sahaja Yogis about children, Vienna, 1986

Shri Mataji: Sit down, no more anger. Now quietly, the babies eat. What was the matter? So much of heat, he? Now you're all right.

[To another baby] Just take it, take some more. What about him? You didn't take any? Come along, come along, have some chana, all the children should have. All right, have some more. Good. All right, who else? Come along, come, come. Yes, Good! Bridget's children are here, are they? Oh Bridget's, no I'm saying this - our Antoinette’s children are they here? No.

Sahaja Yogi: No.

Shri Mataji: They have gone back? They have gone back. They are very thin now, must do something about them. They require some liver treatment I think, both the children are very thin. All the children must be giving calcium somehow. Do you get here some good calcium for children?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: What is it called as?

Sahaja Yogi: They're just tablets, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Interesting? Are they interesting? In India, we get very good ones. Let us see what do you get here, you see because -

Sahaja Yogi: You can buy some of.

Shri Mataji: All right, so we'll take for England also. England you don't get for children.

Sahaja Yogi: Children have calcium tablets, Mother...

Shri Mataji: But they're not interesting ones, children don't like. It's something like calcium oil we have in India. Children like it very much to eat. You have to hide the bottle!

[Laughter]Shri Mataji [to the baby in Her lap.]: You can't eat, I'm sorry. 

He's quite relieved now, see. His feet where all, (scrunch) like that. Now he's all right. Mmhm, now good friendship. He has a liver, little liver, that's why. Whose baby is this one? Yes, ah I see.

[The mother comes to the baby but he does not show interest in her.] [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Don't want to see her. See, that's it.

Sahaja Yogi: No chance. [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Yes, left-sided! [Laughter] You are too more. All right, see how it is working on your left side. So they can see, clearly, children.

They're great saints, you know when they'll be grown up, you will say, "We have no problems". They won't have problems as you have, no, none. Keep happy, you must keep happy otherwise the child suffers.

He's getting it again. See now smiley. It's good now, now good, no problem. No problem, it's all right, beautiful, all right? Ha. Just see the thing. Look at the children and how they feel the vibrations. Now we wish we could be like them, isn't? They are just enjoying, nothing. They give joy! Such a beautiful boy. So now go to mummy, all right. That's it.

Shri Mataji [to the little boy]: Now you go and give it to everyone, to all the children. Go, give it to children, all right. Now give it to the child, give it to her. They like to do it, you know.

No, no, no to her.

[The Child eats it himself] [Laughter].

Shri Mataji: Children!

Nice to play with them.

Now you take this, give it to that girl, give it to her. Hello, you see, you give it to her. Give her, give her now, come along. Put it, give it to her, yes in the mouth. Now give it to her, there.

Sahaja Yogi: He's working very hard, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Poor Bogdana, all of you enjoy the children, that's all. It' so enjoyable. So interesting, they are so interesting, you can just go on watching with them such joy, such love, such love.

Now Linats, [unsure] you see, shy style has started now. He's become a little shy type, you see that's an age when they start feeling shy and then Markandeya was like that, now Markandeya has become a little more confident.

Sahaja Yogi: Most of the time he's shy.

Shri Mataji: So, Markandeya, I'll take your daddy and you both to London, all right?

Markendeya: OK.
