An interesting miracle at the airport. Have you ever seen a man who is seven feet tall? His hips were about this wide, and his back was even bigger. The size of his boots... in a kind of uniform, because he was a security man. So, one of those guys was there one day, at least seven feet tall. What a big man; I've never seen a person like that. He started shouting at people at the back, "Move out of the way, everybody! We are blocking the traffic!" Nobody reacted.

So he lost patience and started pulling people out of the way, especially women with pushchairs. The women were jumping in the air with their pushchairs, one to the left, one to the right. He started making his way towards Mother because she was the source of the blockage. Mother was sitting there, receiving flowers. He started shouting at her, "Please get out of the way! Get out of there!"

So I went to speak to him very fast, because I had to tell this man to respect this very spiritual lady. I touched his arm. "Excuse me, sir, that lady..."

"Did you touch the uniform?" he asked me.

"Yes, yes, sir, I touched the uniform. I just wanted to tell you—"

"Excuse me, did you touch the uniform?"

"Yes, I touched the uniform. That lady—"

"Did you touch the uniform?"

"Yes, I'm sorry, I touched the uniform."

Then he lifted his boot. "You touch the uniform again, and your head will be under my foot." I was amazed.

Then I felt two people push me from behind and drag me back. They were some ladies who said, "Louis, shut up! Leave him alone." That was it; I couldn't do anything. The man carried on all the way towards Mother, pushing people left and right, though he was already a bit calmer. He arrived face to face with Mother. He looked at her—one glance—then he went around her, disappeared, and ran away.

All Mother did was look at him. A man that size—we were all afraid of him.

That reminds me of the fire. You remember when you had a can of burning off the paint in Brompton Square?

Yes, I was there and I watched it. The fire went just like that man, straight to Mother and then right around her like that. Right around her.

You have to tell the full story now.

Well, I think you had a... what do you call it? A blowtorch. Yes, a blowtorch. And Linda... I got blamed for this in a rather unfortunate way.
