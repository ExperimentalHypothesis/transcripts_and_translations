Public Program. Warsaw (Poland), 31 July 1992.

I bow to all the seekers of Truth! At the very outset, we have to know that the truth is what it is. We cannot think about it, we cannot conceptualize it and we cannot read about it.

At this human awareness unfortunately we cannot know it. You have to go to a subtler state of becoming a spirit otherwise you will not know the truth. Truth is to be known as the evolutionary process on your central nervous system. It is not mental knowledge. Now, I will tell you what is the Truth. You have to keep your mind open as a scientist and treat whatever I am saying as a hypothesis and if it is proved then you have to accept it as a concept because it is for your benevolence and for the benevolence of the whole world.

Now, the truth is that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego but you are the pure Spirit.

Another truth is that there is an all-pervading power of divine love which does all the living work. You see these beautiful flowers and we take them for granted. They are a miracle! We see with our eyes that's a miracle. It's a camera! Wonderful! What about this human brain? It's a computer. All these things we take for granted. Who runs your heart? The doctor says there is an autonomous nervous system. But who is this Auto? We have to find out now about our self and this all-pervading power. Now, this instrument (Shree Mataji is touching the mike) is nice, but if it is not connected to the mains it has no meaning. (Shree Mataji pointing towards empty space amongst the audience and asking them to move there) There is room here this side, let these people. You can move a little that side.

All the world's problems are because of human beings. And all the human problems are because of these centers when they are out of gear. So, if we can put these centers right and get connected to this all-pervading power which we can say is union or ' yoga' then all the problems can be solved. Everyone who is born wants to believes into something. There is some sort of a feeling or faith into something.

Especially for you people, who have gone through communism. Now, you believed in communism once upon a time. But now, once it is over what are you going to believe? Are we going to believe in fundamentalism? In the Democratic countries, the fundamentalists have ruined them completely. Any religion is so-called. There is no truth about it because it is money-oriented or power-oriented. It is not spiritual, but all these religions were born on the same universal tree of spirituality. Now they have plucked the flowers and fighting, this is mine, this is mine, with the dead flowers. So now the problem, world problem is fundamentalism. And these fundamentalists are not going to allow you to believe into an universal religion because they want to fight. They want to have wars.

But innately within us, there is a universal being which is the Spirit. Whether we are Polish, English or Indian, we laugh the same way, we cry the same way and all the children behave in the same manner. But when they grown up they are conditioned. Sometimes they are brainwashed. That is how these problems have risen, that there are divisive ideas in the minds of the people.

So, I want to warn you! Be careful! Believe now in your spirit! All these so-called leaders will be exposed very soon because this is the last judgment. This is the Blossom Time! That's what I say! But also this is a time according to Indian scriptures, its a special time when this all-pervading power will become active and It is exposing everything that is falsehood. One good thing has happened to you through Communism, I must say that you did not fall trap to fundamentalism and still your value system is not as much disturbed as far as society is concerned.

But in democratic Countries, you see what demnocracy is. They are gone to another extreme of nonsense. For example, in France, it is conventional law that a housewife can be a prostitute and money has taken over. There is somebody taking photographs! Please, don't take photographs when I am talking! Please! Now, in the Democratic countries, there are some horrible intellectuals who are born like Freud. Recently I have read a book called Fraudulent Freud by a very very learned doctor.

It has been found out by many eminent people, doctors philosophers that his theory of psychology is absolutely hocus pocus. It has no scientific basis but it has such a malignant impact of culture on America, that it is shocking sometimes to see, that how they are destroying their lives. They have got AIDS. They have got diseases, schizophrenia. You cannot think that after ten years there will 30% of white-skinned Americans will remain. They are so much brainwashed by these advertisements that anybody starts something (unclear) they just accept it completely. They have no wisdom. They have no discretion. (Unclear) Very dangerous thing they are! They have churches of so-called God, also of Davis and of witches openly. You don't have many here I think (Shree Mataji is laughing) Such absurd things they do!

Some fashion starts like somebody says, wear six inches of skirt, so in the whole of London, they are wearing six inches of skirt because whatever comes from Paris is more than Bible. They have no brains of their own. Any stupid trend starts (unclear) Indians may be poor but compared to them they are very wise. If anybody suggests like that they will say get lost.

So, you must know what are you facing. The drugs are pouring in. This Mr. Colombus went to America and all the American Indians were killed nicely. They plundered the whole country and now it's their own country. Some of the old people ran up to Colombia and Bolivia.

Now, this is the time when one has to face the punishments for what you have done. In Sanskrit, we call it (कमफ ल) karmphal. But also Tao has called it (Unclear) So, now can you imagine, that from Bolivia only we are getting all these drugs coming down to American nicely. And so-called elite societies of America are indulging into drugs very nicely and to add to this stupidity many false gurus have arrived from India and also from other countries. If some guru says, that you can float in the air and take to height then he can make thousands and thousands of pounds. All such stupid things they accept blindfolded.

So, I want you to be careful. We have to understand that within us there is this power. The divinity within us is absolutely intact. It is not destroyed whatever mistakes you might have committed because the nature is intact, it cannot be destroyed. It will all very well settle. This Kundalini is your individual mother and it knows everything about you. Now, we have God the Father, God the son and there is no mother, who is the Holy Ghost who is (unclear) Another nonsense they talk you that you must (unclear) and Peter who the weakest disciple of Christ, for whom Christ has said that Satan will follow will catch you. He got hold of Peter and Paul edited the Bible!! And he wrote there that I will make your church on top of the rock and give you the keys.

Why did Christ, why did Christ give in to Peter? That is how all these wrong ideas are put that's why Christ has said- 'You will call me Christ! Christ! I will not recognize you! He has saidThose who are not against me are with me! Who are those? So, now it's better you know God or Christ after achieving your self-realization. You can not know him through sermons, lectures, and also through books. He has said - 'You have to be born again!' So, there are some Americans who call themselves 'born again' as if some self-certificate. You cannot create a certificate like that. Whether you are Christian, Hindu, or Muslim you can commit any sin because you haven't got innate.

So, now I will tell you in short what happens when you get selfhood. First of all, when this Kundalini rises she passes through these centers and nourishes them and she integrates. Ultimately she breaks through your fontanelle bone area and gives you the actualization of Baptism, actualization. it is not just some sort of a certificate that you have become a Christian but actually, you can feel the cool breeze of the Holy ghost coming out. So, who is the Holy Ghost? Is not a (unclear) but the primordial mother. Paul (unclear) everywhere. He called Christ's mother as a human. He has no respect for her. It is the people who call him. For five generations the popes were discussing if this Mary was born under original sin or not. So, why did Christ go to attend the church? Attend the wedding? Was he trying to encourage the original sin?

That means all incarnations like Shri Krishna, Shri Rama like Mohammed Saheb, Shree Nanaka, they are all sinners. Only the Cardinals are not sinners because they are not married. What is the logic? So, now we have to see how this Kundalini rises and nourishes the centers and solve our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual problems.

In India now there are three doctors who have got MD in Sahaj Yoga for curing incurable diseases. This relates to science also. Through science, you cannot reach reality. It is not conclusive. It doesn't solve the polarity of issues. So, one has to understand that there is something else beyond these things that we have to achieve.

So, when the Kundalini passes through this center (Shree Mataji points towards the agya chakra) then the first thing that happens is that you become thoughtlessly aware. You live in the past or in the future but if I say live in the present you cannot. So, when this Kundalini passes through this center from both sides this (unclear) institutions of ego n superego open out. And then you become absolutely thoughtless, you are aware and you are in the present. If you want, if you want you can think. If you don't want you need not think. That means your inspiration, your creativity, your dynamism starts manifesting and your peace, you feel the peace.

There are many people I have known who have got peace prizes. I have seen them, I have met them, but they have no peace within. They have got Nobel prizes imagine they have no peace within. But when your attention is enlightened by your Spirit, then it becomes active. Your attention becomes innocent. The greed and lust drops out automatically. Whenever you pay attention you can feel on your fingertips what the problem is. So, you develop a new dimension in your awareness which is called as Collective Consciousness. So you start feeling other person's centers also, not only yours. Now, if you know how to correct your centers and other's centers so there is no problem. This is the only way that you will know the absolute Truth.

So far we live in relative life, relative understanding but then you absolutely know the same thing. Now, Supposing you take 10 children, tie up their eyes, and ask a question what's wrong with this man? (Shree Mataji pointing towards someone in the audience) let her be seated! Better be seated! Is she alright! Alright! You sit comfortably! So, thus you can help others and you can help yourself. So you get your health and you can help others to get cured also.

The first thing that happens to you, that you develop the Divine discretion. All these ten children will say that this is the finger (Shree Mataji showing right Vishuddi finger) catching means they have got trouble with the throat right-hand side. Once you know the absolute truth there is no question of quarreling, fighting, discussions nothing.

We are working in fifty-five nations. For example, In one place in Russia in Taglayati, we have thirty-two thousand Sahaj yogis. Also, I think about sixteen thousand in Leningrad. Many scientists, many doctors are going to have a medical seminar but the thing is, first you have to know that you have to find the truth. And you should not be satisfied with all that is not yet (unclear) The most beautiful thing that happens is that you jump into the ocean of joy. Joy is not happiness and unhappiness. It is absolute. It is the state to be experienced. It cannot be described. So, you become extremely dynamic and you become extremely compassionate. Loving! (There is an exchange of words between Shree Mataji n the Sahaja yogi translating her speech and says something about the word 'compassionate' Shree Mataji and the audience laugh and the audience starts clapping)

See I am seventy years of age and every day I am travelling having programme, every day. And I m quite alright. Now, I have a family, very good husband, very l good children, grandchildren but in a way I am really a communist because I can't live without giving it to others, sharing with others and I am the greatest capitalist because I have the powers.

You also get spiritual powers by which you can awaken the Kundalini of others, give them realization. You can transform people. And you'll be surprised at yourself that you become like an Angel yourself. That's what is there potentially within you. Only thing you have to get your realization. It will hardly take ten-fifteen minutes for you to enter into the kingdom of God. It's only about three to four feet you have to travel. That's all! (Shree Mataji is laughing sweetly)

Now one thing for sure, that I cannot force on you your self-realization. As Christ has said 'humble heart will inherit the earth' but if you are arrogant it won't work. Those who do not want to have self-realization should leave the hall.

Now, there are three conditions. The first one is that you all have to be absolutely confident that you will all get your realization now. That's very important! Also, you should have a pure desire to get your self-realization because this Kundalini is the power of pure desire.

Now, the second condition is very simple that you should not feel guilty about anything. You are all human beings if you have done mistakes, nothing wrong with you. After all, you are not God! And this all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness. Whatever mistakes you may commit,the power of this ocean can completely dissolve it. But if you feel guilty you catch on this center on the left-hand side (Shree Mataji is showing left Vishuddi by putting her hand there) by which you develop, can develop diseases called Angina with the heart. You might develop also spondylitis and lethargic organs. if you have done mistakes alright face it and don't put them as guilt and forget it.

Now, the third condition is even easier, that you have to forgive everyone without even thinking about it. Whether you forgive or don't forgive, logically you don't do anything but if you don't forgive you play in the wrong hands. Those who have troubled you are happy while you aretorturing yourself (unclear) So, you have to forgive all of them. Even don't think of them, it's a headache. These are the only three conditions.

Now before starting I would request you if you can take out your shoes. Those who are sitting on the ground it's alright but those on, everybody should take out their shoes because this Mother Earth sucks in all problems. I must say, first time I came to Poland it was a sad day and I said I should come here again and when I came here, I saw the way they have built up the whole place I said it's resurrection here!!

So, we'll tell you now, we'll explain to you Be comfortable! Be comfortable! All of you be comfortable! You don't have to go to the Himalayas, don't have to fast and you don't have to stand on your head! That means you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

Now, please put your left hand towards me which is symbolic that you are desiring your self-realization because the left side is the power of desire. You can put it on your lap also or you can put it on the table. On the table, it will be alright! I mean comfortable like this! (Shree Mataji is showing her own left hand to the audience for them to follow) Like this! Alright! now the right hand is the power of action. So, the right hand is the power of action so we nourish our centers on the left-hand side with the right hand.

First, we put our right hand on our heart. Please put both your feet away from each other. In the heart is the reflection of God Almighty as Spirit and Kundalini is the reflection of the primordial mother the Holy Ghost. Now if you become the spirit then you become your own guide, your own master. So, now you take your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here! Please keep it here! (Shree Mataji is demonstrating by putting her right hand on the chakra) This is the center of your mastery! Now I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

Now, you put your right hand on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the center of pure divine knowledge which manifests in your Central Nervous System. Then raise your left hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen then again on the heart than on the corner of your shoulder and neck and turn your head right. Turn your head to the right. I have already told you what happens when this center is blocked. All of you should do it. This is to be done only for today night.

Now please take your right hand on top of your forehead and put it down as far as possible. This is the center where you have to forgive everyone in general. Now take back your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes for your own satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine power. We'll do all these things later on. Now, stretch your palm. Now, this is the last center. This is the last center.

Put the center of your palm on top of your head and push back your fingers and put down your head. Push back your fingers and put pressure on your scalp. Put down your head, push back. Put down! Put down your head! Here you have to move your scalp not your hand. Your scalp seven times clockwise. That's all we have to do!! (Unclear) See that your feet are apart from each other! Those who are sitting don't have to.

Your left hand towards me and right hand on your heart. And now please close your eyes. Please close your eyes. Till I tell you don't open your eyes. You can take out your spectacles. Now, here you have to ask me a very fundamental question three times. You can call me Shri Mataji or mother. Now, please ask three times Mother! Am I the Spirit? I've already told you when you are the spirit you become your guide your master.

So now please take your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it. And here you ask another fundamental question. Mother! Am I my own master? Ask this question three times!

I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So now please take your right hand on the lower part of your abdomen and press it. And here you ask six times because this center has six petals. Mother! Please give me pure divine knowledge! As soon as you start asking for divine knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising. So your Kundalini (unclear) higher centers with self-confidence.

So, now raise your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and here you have to say ten times with full confidence. Mother! I am my own Master!

Now, I have told you that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego but you are the pure spirit. So, now you have to raise your right hand on your heart and you have to say with full confidence twelve times. Mother! I am the pure Spirit!

Now this divine power is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of compassion, ocean of bliss, and above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you may commit, this ocean can dissolve all your mistakes. So, forgive yourself!

Now take your hand into the corner of your neck and shoulder. Turn your head to the right and here with full confidence you have to say sixteen times. Mother! I am not guilty at all!

I have told you logically whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything! But if you don't forgive you play into the wrong hands. This center is optic chasma and is very constrained. If you don't forgive it will not open and you will not get your self-realization. So you should not miss that as well. As it is you are touring yourself.

Now, put your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head. Now, here from your heart, not how many times, you have to say- Mother! I forgive everyone in general!

Now, you have to take your right hand on the backside of your head and raise your head as far as possible. Here without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty, for your own satisfaction, you have to say- Oh! Divine Power! If I have done some mistake knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me. This also you say from your heart not how many times.

Now, the last center is very important. You stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of your head on the fontanelle bone area. Stretch back your fingers and put down your head. Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom. You have to ask for your self-realization. So, now you move your scalp seven times clockwise saying- Mother! Please give me my self-realization seven times. (Shree Mataji blows into the microphone seven times).

Now, please take down your hands. Please put both your hands like this towards me and watch me without thinking. You can do it! Raise your hands! (Shree Mataji is demonstrating by raising her own hands) Put your right hand like this. Bend down your head and with your left hand seelike this above your head through your fontanelle bone area if there is a cool or warm breeze coming out. Some get it close some get it far. Now, put your left hand towards me again bend your head see with your right hand. Now, if you have not forgiven everyone you may feel hot still. So, please forgive everyone now. Now, again last time with the right hand. You see with the left hand if the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost is coming out.

Now, please raise both your hands towards the sky and push back your head. Here you have to ask a question three times any one of these three questions I tell you. Mother! Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? First question. Another is- is this the all-pervading power of divine love? Or Mother! Is this the paramchaitnya? Ask anyone of these questions three times. Now, take down your hands. Take down your hands!

All those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands, a hot or cool breeze in their hands, in their fingers, on their palms, on top of your fontanelle bone area, please raise both your hands. Both the hands. Those who have felt the cool breeze. (The camera shows us almost all the audience with their hands raised) I bow to you all! You are saintly life has started. But some people were little arrogant and (unclear) they thought much about themselves so they didn't get it. But most of you have got it! From my heart, I bless you! (Shree Mataji does namaskar with folded hands) You have to know one thing that Sahaja Yoga is a collective happening. Like one finger gets into trouble the whole body runs for it. You'll be happy to know that we have people from England, also from Switzerland, from Germany, and from Austria. They all have come to help you. So, you have brothers and sisters all over the world.

Some of those who haven't got it will ask questions. but asking questions you cannot. It is beyond the mind. You have to get it! Luckily we have a very good center here and very good Sahaja yogis who will give you all the knowledge of Sahaja yoga.
