Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Astagaon (India)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - Draft
I hope you enjoyed yesterday in India. (Sahaja Yogi: Yes). And that you have been able to get out of many things that you were trying to do it. As they said, in the song about “Vinchu Chawla” (a traditional song in Marathi). In the same way, we have problems which must be corrected by ourselves, instead of correcting in others, if we correct ourselves, we can go very far.

I am sure it will work out for all of you, very well, and that all of you will be able to, one each person can establish an ashram, but don’t get involved into small things. First of all, correct yourself, become a great yogi and then involve yourself into higher things, not into mundane lower things. That’s all. It is very simple. You don’t have to go to Himalayas. You don’t have to do anything. You don’t have to give up anything. Nobody should give up jobs. I don’t want anybody to give up jobs or to give up their positions or their country. Nothing of them. There is no need at all.

Wherever you are, you can work it out. And wherever you are, you can achieve it. Especially, for married people those who have to now join their spouses, I wish them all the best for their very happy and prosperous married life. And I hope you’ll not let me down. For your own individual whims, don’t try to make a fuss. These are all individualistic things, not collective things. So please, try to have a collective idea. What will I do if I behave like this? What harm I will do to collective if I behave like this? That is very important. And to see for yourself, just to see for yourself is important.

My own idea is, that India is doing good to you but you are doing good to India as well, very much. And that, you will be doing good to India much more, gradually as you ascend. Because Indians don’t have the capacity to understand their own wealth. Through your reflection only, we can prove what India has and what your character and attitude. So, in both ways, it helps a lot.

I should say sorry for what inconveniences you have had. (Sahaja yogi: Oh! No.) Because you will like me to say that. But only thing a mother feels, the concern that the children should have any problems while touring. Next time, I am sure it will be better than this. I assure we'll not have so many places to go to. I will have beautiful places selected for you where you may be able to settle down. Maybe we may have permanent places very soon established so that our expenses will also go down and we can do much better work. And for long duration. And we may not have to fix the two time like one, one.

Suddenly, you will find that many ashrams will come up. You can go and stay there and enjoy yourself. And teach other people Sahaja Yoga whenever you have time. So, you are already gurus. You have to master complete principle of Sahaja Yoga. Every angle, every vidya (knowledge), you must know. It's not only talking that helps. Never. The person who can only talk doesn't impress people. The one who can do the job, the one who can deliver the goods, that's very important. So, please try, also to build within you the power to give realisation to others and also, to talk to others about Sahaja Yoga.

And throughout, this tour has made you quite capable and has matured you very much. You must achieve your maturity in those tours and should express in your own lives and also, in the Sahaja life. Collectivity is very important. In every nation, in every town, people should arrange some sort of picnics or some sort of seminars. Any kind of a collective happening, individualistic people should be brought in. They should all work together and make it a point that they achieve collective sense. Enjoyment in the collective should be developed. As soon as that happens, you start rising much faster with the collective force.

I am sorry that I have to leave you now. And that I hope to see you very soon. But still, the pang is there. You feel something is going out of you. I will be back in London, I think in April. I don't know when I will be, I have no idea about my program. Whatever it is, you will know about my coming. If you need anything, you can always write to me or telephone to Rajesh. He will telephone to me.

Anything that has happened here, must been of inconvenience to you, you should forgive other Sahaja yogis. They are also your brothers and sisters. I hope you will enjoy your journey back and (UNCLEAR be happy). Don't get involved too much into other things. Keep yourself very much, your attention on to the experiences here and keep that height. Maintain that height within yourself.

May God bless you!

[ Sahaja Yogi: Can I say a few words? On behalf of all of us, your children, Shri Mataji. We would like to thank you for having, organising this wonderful tour and inviting us. If Sahaja Yoga is a learning process, India is the university for us.

We have learnt so much and felt and enjoyed, most of all. But now we feel to just go back and spread whatever we have achieved. And we would like to thank
also, Mr. Dhumal and all the Sahaja yogis of this country India for their love and care. Jai Shri Mataji!

(Chorus: "Jai Shri Mataji!") ]

Now, this is the problem is that he has brought this in bottles for you, meetha (sweet) and also, the water. You can take it with you but it has to go in the fridges. I don't know how you will manage it. But I think you will be able to find some fridge at Nashik and then in Bombay or maybe, you can directly go into the airport. Maybe, it can be managed. It should not get bad as far as I understand. So, please take all these things with you, one each. One each of this and one each of that. And give it. Then, now should I make a move myself?

Sahaja Yogis: Param- Chaitanya Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi ki, Jai! Bolo, Jagat Mata Shri Nirmala Devi ki, Jai!

Shri Mataji: What's that? From Peru? That's too much for me. Oh! So beautiful. It is so much special. (UNCLEAR animal or something?) What is alpaca? Ah! Thank you very much. Thank you.
Alpaca; Al means first and paca means purest. "soft paper ka h" (it is of soft paper ) Thank you very much. Thank you.
