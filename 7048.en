[Marathi to English translation]

First, I will speak in Marathi and then in English.

One should realise that it all comes together with ease. And the Param Chaitanya is making it all come together, that too for our benefit and wellbeing.

What is going on there? Do not talk. Close the door! What are they saying? Do they want to come for the Puja? No, not to watch. If they want to come for the Puja, then let them come. Not to watch. Close the door.

No, no. It is not so. Unless you become a Sahaja Yogi, you do not have the right.

Right. close the door. Come next year. Right. close the door.

[English], please close the door.

Close the door. Close the door so they will go. Tell them Mataji has said they do not have the authority... So, then they will go away. Next year, become Sahaja Yogis. So, then you have all the rights on me.

So... all that happens, it happens with ease. And whatever twists and turns take place – some happen to our detriment; some happen against our wishes. Or we might think – why did it happen like this? So, at that point, we should realise that we do not have more wisdom than the Param Chaitanya.  And that what is beneficial for us is better known to the Param Chaitanya than to us. So, there is no use in thinking like that and damaging our own heads. Those people who have experienced the Param Chaitanya should stay with this faith that whatever will happen will either be good for us, or it will be beneficial to us, or we will at least be able to learn something from it.

If you do not understand even this, then you should realise that you haven’t yet understood Sahaja Yoga. You have basically come into Sahaja Yoga and gone to waste. Basically, you should be true to yourself and accept this. And only once you have accepted this will everything start working out.

While fearing one another, you didn’t tell me yesterday that this place is so beautiful. I just said that I won’t go to that place. There is a factory there. So, everyone shut up. No one said a thing. This is such a nice place, such nice surroundings. In these cold days, where were you going to go with all the children along with you. And what about your Mother? You were going to hoist me along from here all the way at 3.30. And then you were going to keep on the upstairs floor. So, basically you were going to create problems for me. Shouldn’t you have thought a little bit about me as well? I had to travel all the way to here. You should have thought a little bit yourself; how does this hassle Shri Mataji? What does this matter to you? I will come here or to Rahuri. For that little period, you all are engaged. After that all year round, I am the one who is doing all the hard work. Isn’t it? If you had any love for me, and seen the vibrations, you yourself would have told me then that this place is optimum. There is no smell, nothing. Not one person said a word. What is this?

That is why the Puja is delayed; this is delayed; that is delayed. And so much for people of Rahuri. Who are these people from Rahuri? Am I a property of theirs? I will stay where I feel like. Why should you make such a big deal about it? And shouldn’t you all have said anything? See how much a problem this has created for me. Now don’t do this from next time onwards. You should clearly tell me whatever the issue is. All these problems have happened only because no one told me anything. It was such a beautiful place. We would already have had the puja, everything. Now everyone is sitting here hungry and tired. Is there something special of mine in Rahuri? There is no reason that I absolutely must go there. There is no big deal for me that I must go there. Why? We should arrange where the surroundings are nice, the arrangements can be done properly.

Hence, take these ideas out of your heads. In fact, I was surprised how much work has happened in these surroundings. Nothing has happened in Rahuri. I asked them to take out a procession there. They replied: “Where should we do it, Mataji. No one is ready to listen to us.” Forcefully, it was arranged there for Renuka Devi. And still everyone was observing and asking what all the work in Rahuri has given us. In Nagar, in Rahuri – it’s the same 4 people each time. You need dynamic people for it. Sahaja Yoga is not for 2 or 4 people. If you have the faith, then everything will work out. And you should do the work only after holding on to that faith.

English [She is not well; ask her to sit at the back. Better. Let her go from this side. She is not well? She will be alright.]

Mine, me. Wherever this me-ness comes through, that is where you should realise you are going wrong in Sahaja Yoga. That is why these problems come around. This is my place! I did it! What exactly have you done? Just how many Sahaja yogis are there in your place? Count that. Handful. “I have done this! I have done that!” I have seen what you have gone and done.

Ok, then the second thing. “This is my property.” So then why in Rahuri? That is why it did not happen. Once you have the love, it will break it all down. It has been said about the Devi. [Sanskrit: Sankalp, Vikalp, Karoti]. You should not do these nonsensical things about this. None of you have any authority over me. You should realise this. And I will only go to those places where people don’t think that “This is my mine. This is my place.” This place is good. It is no-one’s. If you have not even realised this, then you have obtained nothing in Sahaja Yoga. It is all worthless. You should think of how much rest will this provide to Mataji. “What an honour for us. Our poor Mother. She takes up so much effort for us.” But no – I heard they sat around grumbling. As if “it’s not enough problems yet. We would have given her more if She came here.” What beahviour is this?

You should learn. You must learn a lot in Sahaja Yoga. And these people (the Western Yogis) who have no legacy. They learnt so much, and you couldn’t learn anything. If you are in Hindustan, even then you yourself should be sat in the front. And you will sit in the front even when you will go abroad. Do you also have to be told anew that you should be keeping your guests in the front? We know this as part of our tradition. But no – you will come and sit right in the front.

Secondly, I have told you not to fall at my feet. Because my feet get swollen up. But somehow you will put your hand through the whole melee. Yesterday, one person was having his hand caught up. And then they will go and say “How did this happen? We went to hold on to Mataji’s feet, and my hand got twisted.” That is why it got twisted. Sahaja Yoga means you will be dealt with directly. No half-heartedness.

[This work is not for those who are lame and loose. It requires people of worth.]

After all, how much space is there in God’s kingdom? What do you think? We don’t want to recruit useless people.

So... calmly, you should firstly place yourself. You should stand firm based on your Spirit. You should stand with faith. And you should have the feeling that whatever is happening is optimal. That is the feeling you should always have. Whatever happened – optimum. And what will happen, that too will be optimum. It is for our benefit, and our betterment, because we have entered the Kingdom of God.

If we keep this one thought in our mind, that God witnesses everything and all powerful. And He does it all because of His power (Shakti). He doesn’t do anything Himself. He is just witnessing the drama. And that power knows everything. But why is there this illusion (Maya)? Just because man should learn... he should comprehend something in him about the greatness of God.

Now our behaviour is such that until we don’t go into the temple into a crowd, and until we aren’t stuck in that crowd, up until then whatever audience we have had till then means nothing to us. Unless and until we haven’t been strangled in the crowd, and until we haven’t gone and touched our head in front of the statue, and until we haven’t broken our head and His feet in the process, up until then the audience (darshan) doesn’t mean anything.

My feet, I mean, they absolutely clutch on. This is devilish. What sort of darshan is this? “We came. And now we are going.” Why? “Oh, the darshan is done now.” My dears, there are lot of temples for this darshan (audience). Go to those temples, why are you troubling me? We need disciplined, worthy people here. There is no work in Sahaja Yoga for useless people. It is clear. Half-baked people – absolutely not. If you do not have the courage, leave Sahaja Yoga. There is no favour being done to me. You are doing yourselves favours. This is going to benefit you. You are going to get the blessings. All the benefits are going to be showered up on you. If you understand this, then you will realise how you should behave in Sahaja Yoga.

The culture of Sahaja Yoga is different, differentiated. We should be like the sea – beneath everything. So, all the rivers go into it. How many rivers go into a lake situated on some mountain top? So, standing on top of each other. Pushing the other person down. What madness is this? Why are Sahaja Yogis behaving like this? I sometimes think. I put so much effort into it for so many years. Taught them all along. And they are still behaving the same. Now just how should I explain this to them?

You should let go of the me-ness. This Rahuri is not yours. And this Shrirampur is not yours. And this whole Maharashtra is not yours. You are sitting in the Kingdom of God. But if you want, then stay here in Maharashtra. What great things have happened in this here kingdom?

But there is endless joy in the Kingdom of God. All the saints are sitting there, and we have found the path that leads us to go and join them there. So why should we be trapped in these negligible things? And why should we stay in them? So, we should accept the Sahaja culture. We talk of Nirmal Vishwa Dharma. Vishwa Nirmala Dharma has manifested in America. The reason that it should have been established in America and not here... the reason is that we are not worthy of it here. You should be worthy. You should be bold.

I had spoken about Vishwa Dharma (global dharma) at 7 years of age. 7 years of age! You should be brave. Once you enter Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, you should leave behind these rituals, this uselessness. You should be calm, like the sea. Each person should be like the ocean. If your personality isn’t going to expand like this, then what exactly are you going to do by taking to Sahaja Yoga? You will remain a seed; but a tree must germinate from it. That tree should gain the understanding. If that happens, then one can say that Sahaja Yoga has manifested. Otherwise, it hasn’t. So, understanding is primary, and we should gain it first.

And you should understand that what works out is great. My husband told me to give him one Sahaja Yogi. I must go to the library. So, I asked him to go. Now he got late in the office. By the time he reached, the library was near closing time. The Englishman there started shouting at the Sahaja Yogi... “You are so late. Why did you come like this.” Etc. The yogi calmly responded saying “See, I made a mistake. Since I did not know that the library closes at this time. I agree I was wrong. But now why are you making mistakes?” Immediately that person changed and started behaving correctly. This is the sign of a Sahaja Yogi. If one cannot overcome an issue, then that person is not a Sahaja yogi. You should be able overcome.

I say that a person who can swim cannot fear anything. Of drowning, of swimming. “I can swim. I will overcome any wave.” If you cannot overcome, then what did you gain from so many years in Sahaja Yoga? That’s why there is this half-baked state because we haven’t understood the greatness and grandness of Sahaja Yoga. That we have become the ocean, and that we have a port on every beach. Imagine, these people have come here from 36 countries. As Indians, we cannot sing one song together. Forget Indians, not together from one village. Not from one lane, not from one house. And these people from 36 different countries are singing together. Imagine.

So, you should realise. Tug onto your ears and declare that you have given up this me-ness. Completely. We have given up this me-ness. We are not going to have it... for any place. You would all have tortured me yesterday. 3.30pm we would have finished here; then 5pm we would have reached there. Then I would have had to climb up there. And then all the speeches. From everyone. This was a problem for him and that was an issue for the other. That 3rd person got cancer. You would have told me all of that.

These people do not behave like that is why they have progressed so much. They did not know the first thing about Ganpati. But your attention should be towards that which you want to achieve. Not just here, even in England. If there are 4 Indians, they will come and sit in the front. They don’t know how to sit, and they will sit with their feet up. And then get up and leave mid-way. No attention towards the speech of any such thing. This is the specialty of Indian people. Now what will these people do? If an Indian comes, they tell them that Mother has asked Indians not to come.

Ok, I accept. If a mango tree is brought to England, how will it sprout mangoes? No mangoes, and no apples. Let it be. But people here? Those who have lived here in this land. Within this culture? My dear, what of those saints and their properties? Wherever they sat was theirs. They were from there and look at the importance you are being given like the messengers of God, given you birth like Ganesh. And look at you! You should be true to the criterion.

Forget that. I don’t have the courage to talk about that. Just a little bit of the criteria, and they run away. “We cannot do it.” What sort of Sahaja Yogis are these? It is an exam. Everyone should realise that we are not going to stay the way we were. “Sahaja Yoga means we have become big trees. Something big and special has come within us. Mataji has brought us out of the ordinary and into the extraordinary. How many people used to have self-realisation? That is the self-realisation we got. We have been given so much and look where we still are.” Even the horse will know that you are self-realised. Even the snake will realise; the whole world will know that you are self-realised. When will you realise that you are? It is like a beggar has been raised onto the throne, and he is still begging.

“First, she used to be a maid. Not she has been given queenhood. But her roaming around did not go away. The base behaviour did not change.”

But in Sahaja Yoga, the base behaviour must go away. It must happen! If that hasn’t happened, then it is not Sahaja Yoga. It is worthless. Once a bird comes out of an egg, what is left of that egg? If some fruit germinates from a flower, then what is left of that flower? Similarly, if you were human, and it doesn’t matter what sort of human you were. Now you have become super-human. Where has that power gone? You get covered over again with these bad elements? Then on whose courage should I establish Sahaja Yoga?

Adi Shakti is your Mother. Who else’s mother is the Adi Shakti? How fortunate you all are. I am fortunate too... but I need people of worth. That is when the Mother is joyous. A beautiful letter arrived from America. Everyone had written down their own different feelings in it. And I was filled with joy upon reading it. Wow, what wonderful children of mine!

I want to raise Shivaji Maharajas from within you. Are cry-babies going to stand up like Shivaji Maharaj? Then I feel like it has all gone to waste. All the hard work has gone to waste. So, everyone should stay with one view. Only yesterday I said that there is too much internal competition. And this is an absolutely imaginary thing. Absolutely an imaginary thing. My village, my children, my house, my father and this is my mother. This is all imaginary.

Dnyaneshwar said:” Tyachi Soyare” [Have HIS companionship].

I am ready to arrange everything. For everyone. I am ready to do everything. If a little money goes here or there, it isn’t going to matter to me. But how should we rectify the brains of people? They said: “Mother, it will be very cold tonight. Please make the Sun shine tomorrow.” That will happen. Done. The Sun is in our hand, the Moon is in our hand. The entire universe is in our hand. But how should we manage the brains of people, I do not understand.

All this legacy. You are sitting in the Yoga Bhumi (the land of Yoga). You are such great people. You should realise this. This kind of behaviour, like wayward people. People should say: “We had seen one Sahaja Yogi.” It doesn’t look like that. Still going around in those circles, same issues. Does this look good?

So now I am not ready to listen to any disagreements. It depends on your work. So, until you haven’t given self-realisation to 250 people per person, you should not touch my feet. Only then can you fall at my feet. No rights until then.

Now, guests are here. They should be respected and taken care of. Should I now have to tell you this now? But you will bring your children and come and sit in the front immediately. Immediately. Now, behave properly now onwards. You should behave like nice people.

These people come from so far away to have audience with you. So, they think that India is the land of Maha yogis. Big yogis. This is a kingdom of frauds. And within that the Sahaja yogis should be Maha yogis. And the behaviour of that “Yogiraj” is a little money here, and a little money there? What heights have I taken you to. Gagangad (a saint that Mother has also spoken of in many other speeches) was asking me why I gave you all self-realisation. That he was a frog since the time he was searching for God. I asked him to continue. “But then why did you give it to these people?” I said: “It is my wish. Who are you to force me otherwise?” So, he said: “Why is it your desire to give it to these people?”

After all, I had so many hopes from you. Now you must prove it. The promise that I made to you; I have fulfilled it. Now you must fulfil your promise. You must stand up and deliver. You must give up this internal fighting and this small mindedness. You should have a big heart. So, the hearts of all the saints and sages will be filled with joy. They are ready here to help you out. They are all here and looking at you. Be alert. Now we are in the Param Chaitanya, and we must be completely absorbed into the Param Chaitanya.

Everything is done by Him. Nothing is done by us. You should just pray from the bottom of your heart. All the problems will be solved and all will be good. You should just keep the faith. Lots of things have happened that are because of the faith. But that faith is not settled in your heart. The moment it settles into the heart, a magnificence will radiate from that person. Those who have understood Sahaja Yoga, understand this thing.

[English transcription incomplete]

I have been telling them something about which you need not know. I hope you didn’t understand. Sometimes I have to speak in English when I don’t want them to know anything about you. It’s quite mutual.
