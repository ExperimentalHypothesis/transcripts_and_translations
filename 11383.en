Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

But I, if you wanted to clear this thing, [unclear conversation].
[Laughter]
You see the vibrations? You should see the vibrations.
Just tremendous vibrations. As soon as the hall [unclear] I tried my best, I said, "Baba, now this is going to be covered with vibrations [unsure]".

[Unclear part]

Did you see now, in the end, there were two persons standing. And one of them was a Pastor standing, was he?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: There was somebody standing till the end.
Shri Mataji: He was wearing a blue suit or so?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Sahaja Yogini: He was nagging me with some alcohol
Sahaja Yogi: Hum. He’s been drinking.
[Unclear conversation]

Shri Mataji: Even he tells Me, "Remember we had a problem".
[Laughter]
But I told you that any, if you have anything, you just don't combine them [unsure].
Sahaja Yogi: It took place in other, Mother, program.

Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: It’s not the first time this happens.

Shri Mataji: Not in Switzerland, in Rome. And at the end of it, he quarrelled with her or something. And he wanted to go. But there was a quarrel between her and them. And then she came, "Mother say that we Realized or not?" On my head.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: But I must say one thing, whatever it is, but Italians are very sensitive, very sensitive. There’s a kind of a [unclear]. It's very appealing to Indian style. Translate to everybody.
[Sahaja Yogi translates into Italian].

Shri Mataji: No, they are more sensitive. You see, compared to-
[Sahaja Yogi translates into Italian].
Shri Mataji: You see, they are not yet so dried out. They also, they don't think that everything has come to conclusion now, sort of. You see, "Now we are on top of the world. We are sorted out". They don't think that. They think there are so many things which cannot be explained. They're not so absolutely sure of themselves.

Sahaja Yogi: I told a few people to come tomorrow with lemons, Mother, that will avoid the-
Shri Mataji: We have to get some lemons for tomorrow's program.
We have to take some lemons, chilis, and one lady was depressed and all that, and to them, we’ll have to give photographs also.

Actually, they were not well educated in proper [unclear]. You see, they just do nothing sahaj and they are been comfortable, this. One has to see that. It’s a fact that now they're coming under the legal understanding of this. It’s like the Pope now, under legal problem. Like more [unclear] has come.

Don’t think legal thing come from them because there must be under the [unclear], they must be doing all the illegal things that’s not a good thing [unsure sentence].
Once it starts coming in, everybody will start, you see, understanding it.

Sahaja Yogi: I don't think [Unclear conversation]
Shri Mataji: It’s like the Pope now, you know that. Now the whole authority of Pope is challenged, because there are so many cases of fraud, this scandal, this scandal. Everything is exposed. You see, because the beauty of falsehood is, that it exposes itself ultimately. You must translate it.
[Gregoire translates]

So, there is not a need at all for us be worried about it. They themselves get exposed. Another thing is, all falsehood quarrel among them. But truth is eternal. [Unclear part]

Sahaja Yogini: There are also people from the program here.
Shri Mataji: Some people are coming?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, other. They are already there.
Shri Mataji: Yes. From this program?
Sahaja Yogini: I think so.
Gregoire: A lot of Yogis are coming, Mother.
Sahaja Yogi: At Guru puja, they were already here.
Sahaja Yogini: Two of them are new people from tonight.
Shri Mataji: Really? This lady?
Gregoire: And the lady behind.
Shri Mataji: Oh, good! It’s great. Tonight! [Unclear] that you get your Realisation. What are their names, by chance?
Gregoire: The first name is Lucienne, Fremo is your family. And Helga Foca.

Shri Mataji: I think Geneva will take up very fast. And you don't have to worry. Because people are thinking about it. Translate it.

You see, the more opposition we have, that's a sure sign that they are frightened, you see. So, we shouldn't be upset with that. And they are ignorant people. Actually, those people who have gone through the fanatic ideology, you see, are better to judge. And these young people are just now entering into a new venture. Like this lady, she must have seen all this. So for her, she must be understanding that this is not the end! We have to [unclear].

You see, like people can understand through experience this truth. But you see, we have had all this kind of thing, in every country. Every religion, they have had all these kind of things preachings, this, that. But where have they reached? You see, everybody starts seeing, "Where have they reached?" "We’ve done all this, where are we?"

[Unclear part]

And I am so careful that their ego should not be provoked. I’m very careful with that. And as you know that how gradually we fully talk of Sahaja Yoga, how [unsure] people, when they achieve a certain level of understanding. You don't force the truth on their heads just like that, you see. But despite all that, these things can happen. So one should not get disturbed at all. This is nothing, I tell you, this is nothing compared to what one can expect. This is nothing, just take it easy.
Gregoire: It's nothing to what was, or nothing to what will come? Better warn us.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: I always warn you beforehand. I told you that the fanaticism of the intellectuals is extremely sophisticated.
Gregoire: You talk about this afternoon or this morning.
Shri Mataji: This morning only, I did. Alos, also, protestants also, protestants also. You see, see now, I’ll tell you see what, see how Protestantism has come from the Catholics, you see. They started a big, what you call, a method by which the fanaticism was absolutely gripping you. So, Martin Luther could see. So obvious it was, that the Pope was selling pass through the heaven, imagine, so foolish!

This is what happens with falsehood: always it comes out in such a funny shape, that everybody sees, "Oh, God what sort of a shape it is?"
So actually, Catholicism was a blow to the Jew Catholicism, by the- I should say the Jew fanaticism, by Christ. It was a blow to that. So, he tried to deviate it from that, and give them the right thing, because he wanted to talk about the spiritual life and eternal life and all that.
But so many remained Jews.

Now when Christ came in, what he preached, that also became another Bible. Now the only intelligent can read and split the hair out of it, only intelligence. And then they studied it to see every word, they twisted it to them. Now, with that thing, they believe in it, because this is what they have got the Book in their hand. They have now studied. Now, they are not going to give up.

And that's how they used. Now, I mean actually the Catholics use the same Bible for your information. And the Muslims use the same Torah, the Old Testament, Muslim are using. The complete Old Testament, all the five books. And the same is used by Jews too. So, when Muhammad came, they denied him on those five books. Every time they did like this, using a book.

Then Martin Luther came. He revised the whole thing. He wanted to revise it and do it. He said, "This is fanaticism to that. You should not have these, none of these, and all that. And it's a spontaneous thing". He said it very clearly. But Protestants also became very sophisticated.

Once, a priest from Protestant Church went to Mahatma Gandhi and asked him, "What- why don't you become a Christian?" So, Mahatma Gandhi said, "I'll be very happy but which church should I join? [Laughter] which Bible should I read?" Then the fellow didn't know what to say.
[Laughter]

So, if Bible interpretation is a last word, then it should be the only one. How can there be thousand and one interpretations? Now there are so many interpretations and actually, people are at daggers-hand with each other. Like in, say in Ireland now, think of Ireland where all the people following Christ very ardently, are fighting each other. So, whatever medium they have used, whatever interpretation they have used, is not exact. Because they use their brain according to their own understanding. There are so many Bibles and so many Churches and so many problems.

Now what I'm saying that, to read Bible, you must use your Spirit. [Gregoire speaks, unclear] And the Spirit, you can only achieve it by Realization. But people don't want to have Realization. There is a vicious cercle. Unless and until they get their Realization, they won't understand Bible in its right principle. One sentence of Bible that, "I will appear before you like of tongues of flames". Let them explain. They cannot. And everybody will say something else.

But in Sahaja Yoga, even a person who are children, who are not educated, who can't read Bible, will say the same thing. When Christ said, "You have to be like children", he meant you forget all your education of Bible. They are all complicated people and they have conferences, and arguments and fights. And what are they getting? Just donkeys hitting each other, that's what I feel about them. If it is the truth, if it is the reality, what is there to fight for it? It should be with you, it should be exposed to you, it should be there. You don't fight for your nose, do you? It is your own! But if you want to learn it from others, then nothing can happen. When human being are such, you can brainwash them. You can make them feel there is no God. You can make anything out of them, they are so vulnerable, because they live in the relative world. They have to come to the absolute point.

But they must understand why am I doing it. After all, what am I to gain out of it? I'm not a pastor who is paid for every baptism. I don't take any money. Oh I- by God's grace, I have a very comfortable house of my own, and I live very comfortably with my family. I have to gain nothing out of it. Then why am I wanting to do it? So, this is what it is. But they don't want to think, because, you see, anybody can brainwash human beings.

Like I went to China, first they all talking of Mao, as if Mao was God, you see. Nobody would talk a sentence without, "Mao said so. Our Mao said so". Their Bible [red book] was Mao. Now, once he died, then there was an earthquake, so now they have forgotten about him. They think he was rather wrong. Some of them believe that he was absolutely wrong.
[Laughter]
Hitler came in: all the Germans believed that Hitler was absolutely correct. "We are all chosen people. We are supposed to be elite". What a stupid thing to believe! I mean how can they believe such a stupid thing like that! And to be believing in such a nonsensical thing, how much harm they have done to human beings and to their basic values, which are [unclear] of Christ. So he failed by God's grace. Now they say it's a political mistake. You see, it is a very minimized [unsure] way of saying things, you know. It’s sophisticated: "political mistake".
I think there has been lots of this brainwashing going on of these fanatics. Now look at Khomeini. You think Khomeini is wrong. But if you go to, or you talk to anybody from that country, you'll be amazed that even some Indians who are there, are believing that Khomeini is correct. Can you believe it?

You see, people don't have their own personality to think. They talk of individualism, but I think they are only [unclear] type of people. Then an individual rises and he fights this kind of a thing. Then others join him, but they again become another club. But it is not a living club ,there is no living oneness. So, it will all fall off. It will be all dead and [unclear] and [unclear]. But the living thing, when it is one, then it is completely, absolutely in the best of its manifestation. And that is what people don't understand that clubbing, as "dead people’, is of no use, under any banner. You see, you form any organization, all go down. They lose their essence, because they get away from that essence, because they are dying [unsure]. So, only the organization that is living is the eternal organization.

But you cannot organize the living organization with your mind. It just is organized like all my five fingers act according to the way I want. I don't have to think beforehand that when I lift his finger, this finger also must move. And I don't plan it that way, it just happens. The whole body reacts together in a full integrated manner, because it's a living body. In the same way, if people get Realization, many people get Realization, you form that great Primordial Being which is now awakened as the cells of that Primordial Being.

There’s a fighting is now going on between Jews and PLOs. It’s a fighting going on between Khomeini and these Iraqis. There’s fighting going on, between people in say Chile and Argentina. It's all nothing but the fighting that they are right. The Russians are fighting the Afghanistanis. The so-called Christian nations like America is supplying all arms to all the countries. Imagine, they are Christian Nations supplying arms to all other nations.

Now the Swiss people are supposed to be very Christian, they are allowing all the thugs to put their money in the banks. India is poor because of these Swiss banks, what else?
Gregoire: And the Britishers because [unclear].
Shri Mataji: That was first. British thugs did their level best. But then now the Swiss banks. At this stage, the Swiss banks with all the thugs of India, all the politicians of India, all the people who are making money out of the poor people, are hiding it here, not in India.

Now they found another monetary fund, you see, imagine from this side to this side, from that side to have a monetary fund to help the developing. I know a very great man from Mauritius, who always used to come to Switzerland. And then it was discovered that he is the one who had taken lots of money from Mauritius. Sukarno, another fellow, all his money was in here! It’s a fact. All the false gurus’ money is here, in Swiss Bank, not in American Bank.

So, this is another Christian Nation. One Christian Nation, America, is trying to send all- sell all their weapons and their bad medicine developing countries. Now this is another: Switzerland.

Now England are the people who dominated all over the world. They went up to China, you see, who asked them to get out of their place? They went everywhere in India, they stayed for 300 years. And now they don't allow Indians to stay there even for three months! And openly they are racists. These are Christians.

Look at the French! The great Christians of France. Christ has said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes". Every third lamp post, you meet a prostitute in that country. And every seventh lamp post you see a pub there. They are Christians, no morality, and no respect for oneself and body. Such indecent people. These are Christians.

Then Germans when they fought they killed so many people, they were still believing in Christ and God. And they said, "We are killing the Jews because they didn't believe in Christ".
Now Jews are killing the Arabs because they don't believe in Jews.
[Laughter]

You see, this is madness. I mean just think of Christ, what would he think or the people who are supposed to be Christians?
We must face ourselves and see that we have to do a lot if we have to really make Christ live within us. All right, that's all right, so you sing.
[Sahaja Yogis sing the praise of Shri Mataji with a different tune.]
It’s very nice [unclear].
[Laughter]
Otherwise, how would I have brought all these points to you? [Unclear]
Now what we’ll do, [unsure] just come inside. I guess you will all have some tea.
[Unclear]
Enjoy yourself. Enjoy and just laugh!
