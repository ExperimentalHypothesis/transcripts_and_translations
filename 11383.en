Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - In Progress

But I, if you wanted to clear this thing, [unclear conversation].
[Laughter]
You see the vibrations? You should see the vibrations.
Just tremendous vibrations. As soon as the hall [unclear] I tried my best, I said, "Baba, now this is going to be covered with vibrations [unsure]".

[Unclear part]

Did you see now, in the end, there were two persons standing. And one of them was a Pastor standing, was he?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: There was somebody standing till the end.
Shri Mataji: He was wearing a blue suit or so?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Sahaja Yogini: He was nagging me with some alcohol
Sahaja Yogi: Hum. He’s been drinking.
[Unclear conversation]

Shri Mataji: Even he tells Me, "Remember we had a problem".
[Laughter]
But I told you that any, if you have anything, you just don't combine them [unsure].
Sahaja Yogi: It took place in other, Mother, program.

Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: It’s not the first time this happens.

Shri Mataji: Not in Switzerland, in Rome. And at the end of it, he quarrelled with her or something. And he wanted to go. But there was a quarrel between her and them. And then she came, "Mother say that we Realized or not?" On my head.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: But I must say one thing, whatever it is, but Italians are very sensitive, very sensitive. There’s a kind of a [unclear]. It's very appealing to Indian style. Translate to everybody.
[Sahaja Yogi translates into Italian].

Shri Mataji: No, they are more sensitive. You see, compared to-
[Sahaja Yogi translates into Italian].
Shri Mataji: You see, they are not yet so dried out. They also, they don't think that everything has come to conclusion now, sort of. You see, "Now we are on top of the world. We are sorted out". They don't think that. They think there are so many things which cannot be explained. They're not so absolutely sure of themselves.

Sahaja Yogi: I told a few people to come tomorrow with lemons, Mother, that will avoid the-
Shri Mataji: We have to get some lemons for tomorrow's program.
We have to take some lemons, chilis, and one lady was depressed and all that, and to them, we’ll have to give photographs also.

Actually, they were not well educated in proper [unclear]. You see, they just do nothing sahaj and they are been comfortable, this. One has to see that. It’s a fact that now they're coming under the legal understanding of this. It’s like the Pope now, under legal problem. Like more [unclear] has come.

Don’t think legal thing come from them because there must be under the [unclear], they must be doing all the illegal things that’s not a good thing [unsure sentence].
Once it starts coming in, everybody will start, you see, understanding it.

Sahaja Yogi: I don't think [Unclear conversation]
Shri Mataji: It’s like the Pope now, you know that. Now the whole authority of Pope is challenged, because there are so many cases of fraud, this scandal, this scandal. Everything is exposed. You see, because the beauty of falsehood is, that it exposes itself ultimately. You must translate it.
[Gregoire translates]

So, there is not a need at all for us be worried about it. They themselves get exposed. Another thing is, all falsehood quarrel among them. But truth is eternal. [Unclear part]

Sahaja Yogini: There are also people from the program here.
Shri Mataji: Some people are coming?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, other. They are already there.
Shri Mataji: Yes. From this program?
Sahaja Yogini: I think so.
Gregoire: A lot of Yogis are coming, Mother.
Sahaja Yogi: At Guru puja, they were already here.
Sahaja Yogini: Two of them are new people from tonight.
Shri Mataji: Really? This lady?
Gregoire: And the lady behind.
Shri Mataji: Oh, good! It’s great. Tonight! [Unclear] that you get your Realisation. What are their names, by chance?
Gregoire: The first name is Lucienne, Fremo is your family. And Helga Foca.

Shri Mataji: I think Geneva will take up very fast. And you don't have to worry. Because people are thinking about it. Translate it.

You see, the more opposition we have, that's a sure sign that they are frightened, you see. So, we shouldn't be upset with that. And they are ignorant people. Actually, those people who have gone through the fanatic ideology, you see, are better to judge. And these young people are just now entering into a new venture. Like this lady, she must have seen all this. So for her, she must be understanding that this is not the end! We have to [unclear].

You see, like people can understand through experience this truth. But you see, we have had all this kind of thing, in every country. Every religion, they have had all these kind of things preachings, this, that. But where have they reached? You see, everybody starts seeing, "Where have they reached?" "We’ve done all this, where are we?"

[Unclear part]

And I am so careful that their ego should not be provoked. I’m very careful with that. And as you know that how gradually we fully talk of Sahaja Yoga, how [unsure] people, when they achieve a certain level of understanding. You don't force the truth on their heads just like that, you see. But despite all that, those things can happen. So one should not get disturbed at all. This is nothing, I tell you, this is nothing compared to what one can expect. This is nothing, just take it easy.
Gregoire: It's nothing to what was, or nothing to what will come?
[Laughter]
