English Transcript

Shri Mataji:

They are wearing the frocks of the cloth we brought in Australia. You would be happy to know, I had brought the cloth you remember which I sent to all these children here. And they are wearing that.

It is a symbolic mother from Shri Ganesha

No, they ...Actually, the whole thing is about me only describing. The whole thing is very beautiful. You should get the translation of the poem they have recited...  I am sorry I have to speak in this language because they don’t understand but you must understand the language of the heart.

(Marathi translation missing)

Talk to them   Even if English is little wrong doesn't matter(27:57) grammatically if the English is wrong in pronunciation Otherwise they will think they do not respect us. So I am just giving them confidence that you go and talk to them...There is no need to have first-class English for you, after all, it's alright. Is it? You all understood. They are all graduates here All are very educated people. No otherwise also. You see

The education in Pune is so great that ...Most of the ladies would be graduates, M.A's. All very well educated women and Men too. Most of the men are graduates, doctors, this ...that. But you see they are so humble that you can make it out. Education is too much but as far as the English language is concerned, naturally, you can understand it's a foreign language, despite that they know quite a lot of English. Not so good as you people after all. I am saying be friendly with them. Be friends you see ... Here the friendship is the men are friendly with men and women’s are friendly with women’s. It's a

Very pure country. And the other things that exist in the western countries we should never discuss with them and tell them. They don't know.   They are not aware of this. They are too simple.

So let them be friendly and they will explain to you...

This is a very good excuse If there is any barrier it will break Isn't it? They must talk to you.
