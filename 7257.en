Public Program. Royal Albert Hall, London (UK), 24 June 1993.
Shri Mataji: It's all right.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot conceptualize it, with this human awareness. We have to be in another state where we can understand it, know it, on our central nervous system. Whatever we have achieved in our evolutionary process we can feel it on our central nervous system. In the same way we have to feel the truth, the absolute, on our finger tips. It has to be tangible. Itâ€™s not a make belief, it's not a blind faith, but one has to experience it, on the central nervous system. But the problem is that so far, those who achieved something also of this nature, were singled out and they were never respected.

 

A great poet, Kabir, says that, "How am I to explain anything? The people are so blind." Even William Blake was treated as a lunatic in this country. It was impossible for these seers, these prophets, to explain, to talk about the Divine. But, till they lived, nobody understood them and followed them. And then when they were no more, people built mosques, temples, churches. And when we see the mess of these religions we are surprised, how can it be. How can people kill each other in the name of God? How can they make money, the way they are making in the name of God? People are amazed, who are little bit aware, that there's something wrong somewhere. And whatever was told was not followed properly. There is no connection. One starts feeling, when they see the private lives of people who are in charge of those religions, that there's something definitely wrong. So then, they take to science. And science is amoral. It has no morality. It deals with matter, and matter is controlled by the Divine. It cannot deliver the goods as far as our spirituality is concerned about knowing the Absolute. So we are stuck at a point where we call ourselves human beings, we have the human awareness. But we don't have the absolute knowledge, that's why everybody is quarrelling, fighting, wars, in some name or other we are hating each other. If the Divine has created all of us, why there is such a problem? In the nature there isn't. Look at these beautiful flowers here. On the tree, they grow, all the leaves are spread properly. No problem, nobody tries to aggress anyone or to kill anybody. Everybody, if you call them some bodies, then they all help each other to get the maximum sunlight. You go in a forest, there may be a tiger and all kinds of animals there, you don't have any bad smell anywhere. They know how to, the whole cycle of nature is worked out beautifully. But if you feel that there's some dirt filth and you smell it, then know there must be some human beings living there. Because men only have the power as human beings, to spoil everything, or to become the Spirit. Because human beings are at the epitome of evolution. They have no ideas to how glorious they are, how great they are.

 

I find in the West people are trying to find their identity, they curl their hair, or do all kinds of things. The identity lies within yourself. When you say, "These are my eyes, this is my nose, this is my body", that means you are not this body, this mind. This is yours, but you are not the same. So you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this ego, these conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit. And that's what you have to become, every religion has said that, every religion. Mohamed Sahib has said it, clearly, that there have been so many wallis before. And there are going to be so many wallis also. You have to be a walli, He said it clearly. I met in Turkey, sufis. Of course, in India, we have very great sufis, Nizamuddin Sahib was there, and also we had Chishti, in Chishti we had another one. Everywhere we had sufis like that, and they believed in Sahaja Yoga only. But they remained in different category. But in Turkey, thanks to Ataturk, I think, that these prospered very well. And they came to Me, and they just surrendered to Sahaja Yoga. They wanted their Realization, they got their Realization. When their guru came, he also got his Realization, and he said, "This is Sahaja Yoga which is going to transform the whole world". They, of course, they are in a way Muslims, because born in Muslim families, and that they sing the praise of Mohamed, of Ali, of Fatima, of everyone. But they don't consider that, "We are the only chosen ones". Such beautiful people they were. They got their Realization, "What it is? What about Christ?" He said, "Those who are not against Me, are with Me". Who are those, who are with Him? He was hardly given three years to express Himself. People were so blind at that time.

 

It is, every religion has talked about the Spirit, and the spirituality, but it has become now spiritism. These all kinds of black magic and things, that has become the religion. Or it has become a power oriented thing. All kinds of nonsense you hear and you are really so sad. Like in Bosnia, so many Muslims are killed. For what? Because they are Muslims. In some places Christians are killed, because they are Christians. It's going on, everywhere, and now it's time for us to stop it. We have no problem now with Russia, and we'll never have a world war now, I hope so, but we have a problem of fundamentalism. And that comes from the ignorance that we are all part and parcel of one personality. And this ignorance has to go. And that can be done very easily once you become the Spirit.

 

Now, it's not question of I'm telling you, as a sermon or a lecture. but it's a happening, it's an actualization of that experience, which is important. This experience is something, which is extremely valuable today, for the whole world, because this is the time of Last Judgement. And this is the time when people are going to get their Self Realization. One has to understand, is a very important time now, Say, we say from chimpanzee we have come to human level, supposing even if we accept that, but there were two other races, which came as human beings. They disappeared. In the same way there are people who are still seeking power, money, in the name of God. Can you imagine? Those who are seeking all such things, should know that it is not reality. Now when those people who see them, also they say, "No, there's no God", abhor that name, they are also wrong, because very unscientific. Have you found out, if there is God or not? By seeing a Hindu misbehaving, or a Muslim misbehaving, or a mula misbehaving and a pandit misbehaving, you cannot blame God for that. You cannot deny God. If you are denying God, I would like to know in these modern times, what is the scientific proof that you are saying there is not God. Have you found out? Have you made any discoveries about it, that there is no God? So with a very open mind of a scientist, you have to understand that there is God, which is a hypothesis before you, which you should not accept blindfolded. but if it is proved, then as honest people you have to accept it.

 

It's very important today, that this world has to change to the emancipation and transformation of human beings. All the problems of the world today, if you see, really, are from human beings. And all these human beings are having problems, because of their centers are in trouble. If somehow or other, we could cure these centers and connect our being to that All Pervading Power of Divine Love, we enter into the kingdom of God, which is promised by every religion. Again I say, you see these beautiful flowers here, and we take them for granted. We never even think how they are here, on this earth, with a little seed. How does this Mother Earth gives this beautiful flowers? It's such a miracle. It's a miracle like that, the photographs you are seeing. This is another miracle. But we take it for granted, all living processes. Everything we take it for granted. And we never try to judge whether it is a miracle, or how it has come. We never even think about it. Who does this living work? Supposing we extend our imagination, who does this living work? This living work, I say, is done by the All Pervading Divine Power of Love. This may be called as Ruh, could be called as Brahmachaitanya, Paramachaitanya. Patanjali has called it as Rithambhara Pragya. You may call it by any name but this power exists. Now, only thing is, you are to be connected to this power. Like this instrument is connected to the mains, otherwise it has no identity, it has no meaning. Only thing you are to be connected to this All Pervading Power. Once you are connected, you'll be surprised at yourself, how glorious you are, how great you are, what powers you have and what you can achieve. You suffer from stress and physical troubles, mental troubles, economic troubles, political troubles. All these troubles get solved. Say there's complete darkness here, and there's commotion, you will in any way, stamp it onto other people. You will, because there's darkness, trying to run, not knowing which is your aim, where to go, what to do. That's what is world today. Is it to be pitied, that people are not genuinely seeking the truth? If they are, is their right to get their Self Realization, that is what Sahaja Yoga is.

 

So the truth is that you are the Spirit, pure Spirit, the second one is that there is this All Pervading Power of Divine Love, which does all the living work. It runs our heart, it gives us children, it gives us beautiful nature, everything that is spontaneous, Sahaja, Saha is "born with you". The right, to become united, yoga, with this All Pervading Power. But it is so simple, that people don't understand. They think, "How can it be so simple?" It has to be. Because it is so vital, it is so important. Supposing if your breathing was difficult and you had to read books for that, what would have happened? It is extremely vital. But somehow human beings always think that you shouldn't eat your food like this but go round and eat like that. It is a very, very simple thing, Sahaj also means very simple, spontaneous. So the Kundalini is there, She is residing within you, She is your Mother, She knows everything about you, very anxious to give you, your Self Realization. It's like the primule in the seed, which has to sprout. Now, what you have to do is to put this seed in the Mother Earth, and the Mother Earth has the built-in quality to sprout it. and the seed has a built-in quality to get sprouted. It is, you can't explain. In one seed, do you mean to say there are maps of all the trees it is going to produce? Go to the microscopic thing, and it is vast. Go to the universe, it's vast. The cosmos is vast. But a simple thing is that you are the epitome of all this creation, and you are the one who has that source of knowledge, of joy, and absolute truth. This is what you are, and it's your own, so why not have it.

 

People sometimes, told Me that, "Mother, if you say that, <<you can get it free>>, then we can't believe it". I said, "But why?" "Because supposing if it doesn't happen to us, we can go to the Courts." I said, this human mind doesn't understand, that it is something your own, your own evolutionary process and what have you paid for it? Nothing. Do you mean to say God understands money and bank? No, no, it's all man made problems, complications. What is within you, is a beautiful Spirit, which is reflected in your heart. And this, your Mother, who is your Kundalini. It has nothing to do with paganism and all that, you see, just to discard something as paganism. If Indians have to learn science from you, why not learn the science of the roots from Indians? What's wrong? But people take to falsehood very easily, even in religion I have seen. You must first of all verify, the people who are talking about God and religion what is their personal character. Are they genuine? Secondly, what are their disciples like? Do they have any powers? Do they know anything? Unless and until you are verifying these things, you should not take to false people. And falsehood is so rambling, is so evident, if you just use your logic, you'll find out, falsehood. What's the use of using false things? If reality is within you, why not achieve it? This is such a beautiful thing that you are. You must accept yourself, you must honour yourself, respect yourself.

 

Another western problem is a fashion to feel guilty, which I just don't understand, why do you feel guilty? After all you are human beings, you are not gods. If you make mistakes, what's the use of feeling guilty? If you have done mistakes, just face it. Face it up and finish with it, that you will not do it again. But no use feeling guilty all the time and spoiling your centre here on the left hand side, which can give you not only spondylitis but also angina, and lethargic organs. The Sahaja Yoga today is on a scientific basis explained. We have doctors who have proved how Sahaja Yoga has cured cancers and things. And also we have scientists who have proved many things, which are said in Sahaja Yoga. So it is tangible, it is not that something is said, which has no basis. And that is what one has to do, is to have an open mind of a scientist, take to Realization and see for yourself. If it working out, then you prove all these saints were correct.

 

Like Guru Nanak has said "Sahaja Samadhi Lago". So what is the meaning of "Sahaja Samadhi Lago"? Who understands that? What is Samadhi? All of them have talked about it. I do not want to mention all of them, but you can find out after Realization, that they were everywhere, telling about this, Of course they were not in a group but they were tortured, troubled, hanged, poisoned. Now, these are the days, are different. You can't hang a person for that. But also for our benevolence we have to accept it. We have to accept it because it's our own, and we have to have it. It's a very, very simple thing which one has to understand that you cannot be only a human being. Must be something more to you. If only being a human being solves the problem, then there will be no problem at all. But there has to be something more. And that is not that you shave yourself off or you, you wear funny dresses, it's not that. By that you do not change. But a inner transformation is needed and for that you have got the Kundalini. But it cannot be forced. First of all, you have to ask for it. If I am born in a Christian family, I'm a Christian, if you are born in Muslim family, you are Muslim, you are born in a Hindu family, you are a Hindu. It's not a matter of choice. But what is needed is to understand that all human beings are born in some religion or other. But do you find that religion has gone inside them? No. You can find, whenever they get a chance they will do anything they feel like against what their religion has told them. So reason is they haven't got that power. of religion within themselves. Only after Sahaja Yoga you'll be amazed - I mean, I am myself amazed that people have given up drugs overnight, alcohols overnight. I don't have to tell. I don't tell anybody, because if I tell "Don't drink", half of you will go away. So it's all right. You come along into the area, you can give Realization to others, you can diagnose the diseases of others, you can cure people. Apart from that you get all the knowledge which is so subtle, which is real. All other knowledge is called as avidya, is not knowledge, but is non-knowledge. The real knowledge is the knowledge of the Spirit, which cannot be challenged, it cannot be changed, it is, it has been and it will be. All these things people have said, only the difference is today, you have to get the actual experience of that. That's the only difference. And also that is en-masse. Thousands of people can get Self Realization. It's the blessings of these modern times, which are called as Ghor Kali Yuga, the worst times. This is the time only this was to happen, and it's happening all over the world.

 

I don't think I can explain to you about Sahaja Yoga in this short time. After all I don't know how many lectures I must have given in English language itself, and so many other languages. But what is the use of talking about it? As I always said that there are so many beautiful lights here. For that, you have to just put the switch on, because it's all built-in. But supposing I start telling you all the story about how electricity was found and how it was brought to London, and then to this Royal Albert Hall, you'll be all absolutely bored. Best thing is to have your lights on. As you have seen today, all the Sahaja Yogis were sitting, and on top of their head there was light. Also there are many other photographs they have not shown of the children, Sahaja Yogi children are born to Sahaja Yogis. They are born realized, and they have a glow around their head, you can see. All this is happening maybe to prove you people something. But cameras are wonderful thing I have seen, that those people used to mesmerize and play some tricks were found out by the cameras. And with Me they play these tricks. So these modern times are something special I must say, that cameras are discovered and they can really somehow or other make the picture of these vibrations. It is hard for people to give up their conditionings, because they think now, we are born into this thing, born into... No, you are born, but you are not that. To be that, in whatever religion you are born, you have to be a realized soul. To be a real Englishman one you have to be a realized soul, otherwise you cannot be. To be a real Indian, you have to be a realized soul. Because you don't know the glory of your country. You don't know what your country is. Like they said that I have told them that is the heart. Now the proof is there. Heart of the universe is England. That's why everything circulates, you see. Anything goes wrong here, circulates all over. Of course we have now yellow journalism, and the media and all that nonsense is going on. But even that circulates.

 

So you are placed in a very important place, is the heart of the universe. And see the proof is shown by the cameras. This is the small portion they have taken out otherwise there are hearts, hearts, hearts everywhere. So just to feel that you are here in England, you have to also feel that you have not yet felt, the reality of England. And the reality can only be felt when you are in the realm of reality. And this realm of reality lies within yourself, which is very easy to achieve. So the power that achieves it is that of Kundalini, and it's the pure desire. If you have the pure desire, it will work out. But if you are arrogant, if you are here to criticize, or to make some sort of a commentary, Kundalini won't rise. You have to have pure desire to become the Spirit, that's all. Depends only on one point that you have to have pure desire. You don't have to pay anything, you don't have to think anything, you don't have to do any mantras, nothing, but just the pure desire to be that. Because as you know, in economics, in general, wants are not satiable. But once you achieve the state of Spirit, then you become the giver. The only want you have, that how many people I can give Realization, how many people can be saved. And without any ego about it. You will see that after Realization, you will start talking in the third person. It's a beautiful state within yourself, which is dormant, which you have to achieve. There's another point I have to tell you, that today Sahaja Yoga is a collective happening. It is not that in your house, you sit down and do Sahaja Yoga, you cannot do it. You are a part and parcel of the whole. Like, if my nail is cut out, it doesn't grow. So you have to come to the collective. You don't have to pay for anything, nothing, but you have to come to our collectives. As we do not take money, for maintaining big temples, or big places, you must understand that wherever people are feeling this All Pervading Power, is the best place to go to. And you shouldn't think about what was the hall like, or where they were doing all these, or what sort of people were there, because the door of Sahaja Yoga is open to everyone. Sometimes we really get lunatics walking in. Doesn't matter. But some of them do get cleared out. Some of them do get cured. We don't criticize anyone. Let everyone come. And I'm amazed that so far those who have come to Sahaja Yoga, have all achieved their selfhood. And I wish you all good luck.

 

We'll do a little meditation just now and I'm sure all of you are going to get your Self Realization, no doubt of it. I know there are questions in your heads, quite a lot, doesn't matter. You can write them down and send it over, we'll answer them. But this question and all, that you I become an expert now, dealing with this kind of thing for the last 21 years. So I can answer all of that, no doubt. But it's just a mental acrobat. You have to ask for the experience of your being. What's the use of discussion, argument and conferences? What have you achieved out of that? So just to ask for your Self Realization, it's very important. Now, those who do not want, I cannot force on them. Your freedom as a human being, is worshipped, is not only accepted but it's also worshipped. If you want to go to hell, you can go. If you want to go to heaven, you can go to heaven as well. So, cannot be forced. As I said, it's the pure desire, is the one that is going to work it out. All those who do not want to have it, should leave the hall, could be better, and not to sit down here, watching others and criticizing. That would be a much better idea, to leave others to have the experience. It is a chance that My husband got elected to a job here, and I came to England. And it has been really a great experience because I found that this is a place where, if Sahaja Yoga is established, it will work out everywhere very well. And it did. But amazingly it has worked more in Russia, more in the Eastern block. Because they had no religion, imagine. They were clean slates. No bindings. And you won't believe that in Russia we always have it in big stadiums, sixteen thousands to eighteen thousands people. And people are sitting on the ground. And all of them get Realization. And Eastern block, all of them. So this too much of freedom, has made us mad also. That's why our attention is not so good. But despite that it has worked. I could not have worked in communist countries, only in democratic countries I could work. But as now, in Russia and all these places, we have got a regime so called, which says they want to be democratic. We had a chance to get in. And they wouldn't accept any false person. All of them were thrown out. I don't know how they knew. Only I know about the writers, Russian writers, that they are very introspective, very introspective. And they put even the hero into introspection, and the heroine into introspection. While in democracy we do not introspect. That may be one of the reasons that they are extremely introspective. So, it is for you to accept or not to accept.

 

As I said, it cannot be forced. But the whole thing works out beautifully. There are few things which I'll tell you how to do it, and I'm sure it will work out very well tonight. So again I would request, those who don't want please go away. It's better for us, it would be very kind. First of all, I would request you to take out your shoes, because this Mother Earth, as I said you are sitting in the heart of the universe. So if you could take out your shoes, will be a better idea. You can't imagine sitting in your chairs you can get your Realization, you don't have to go to Himalayas or anything, nothing of the kind. All right. Can you get somebody to show? Doctor, can you come here? That's dr. Spiro from England. Now, first I will show you, how you yourself will have to enrich your own centers. It's very simple. Because you have to know, that the centers if they are in trouble, then the Kundalini takes time to rise. So there are two things I would say, which are important, or can be conditions. Firstly, as I told you, you don't have to feel guilty. If you feel guilty, this center catches, on the left side. And it is catching, today. It's a common fashion, you know, it's like as they say, "it is in to feel guilty", to be miserable, to show that you are very miserable. If somebody looks very happy, people don't understand.

 

Like I went to France. First they said, "Mother, You look very happy, they won't like You". I said, "Really?". "No, they are very miserable." I said, "For what?", "They are. They are worried about this world will be destroyed very soon." All right? So I started My lecture with "Les Miserable". So we need not have that kind of an attitude towards ourselves. First of all, you are not to feel guilty at all. I request you again and again not to feel guilty. There's nothing to be confessed, nothing to feel bad about. Past is past and finished. It doesn't exist anymore. Future also doesn't exist. In the present if you have to be, then forget the past, for the time being. Secondly, you have to forgive everyone, it's very important. Many people have told Me, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive". I said, "Why?"  Logically if you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. What do you do? Nothing. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So, during the course of this raising of Kundalini I'll request you to forgive everyone, and before that if you forgive, is well and good, because then, this centre catches. Between the optic chiasma is this centre, is closed like this, the most constricted centre we have, in the modern times. But if you forgive, it opens out, and the Kundalini can rise. As it is, you have suffered so much, playing into the hands of wrong people, and again today you may miss the point, may not get your Self Realization, if you don't forgive. Don't think about them, it's a headache. Just say, "I forgive everyone of them". "Everyone of them I forgive". Or you can say, "I forgive all of them". It's the best. You'll feel much lighter even now.

 

Now, we'll show you, what is to be done. Just now, don't close your eyes. Put your left hand like this towards Me on your lap, comfortably. You have to be comfortable. If there's anything tide here or tide on your waist or anywhere please loosen it, but you have to be comfortable. Now, put your left hand like this. This is just symbolic or the expression that you want to have your Self Realization. Left side is the power of desire. the right side is the power of action. All these things you will know. It doesn't take much time to know all these things. So now, you put your right hand on your heart first, because in the heart is reflected the God Almighty as Spirit. And then, you have to put your hand on the left hand side of your abdomen, in the upper part, because the left side will be working with our pure desire, working on the left side. Now, if you are the Spirit, you become your own master. You become your guide, you are your own guru. So this is the centre, where you become yourself, your guru, which is created by all the prophets and seers and saints, for us. We have to just awaken it. Once it is awaken I don't have to tell you what is your religion. You just follow it. You do it yourself. Then below that, it's the centre here, is the centre of pure knowledge. which is quite surprising for people how can it be there. But it is there. And how it is there and how it gets transformed to the brain and all that, you will know later on, how it works out. So it is in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side, is the pure knowledge, as you call it, shuddha vidya. Then you raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. Then on your heart again. Then, in the corner of your neck and shoulder, where I told you this left Vishuddhi is catching, and turn your head to your right. Then please take your right hand, on your forehead across, and put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to forgive everyone. And don't feel guilty. So best thing would be then to put your left hand, right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Here, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power. If you have done any mistakes, let the Divine Power forgive you. because this is for your satisfaction, again I say so. I don't want you to feel guilty about it and count your mistakes. Now, then stretch your palm fully. In the centre of the palm is very important because you have to put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. As we call it in Indian language is talu, which was a soft bone. Put it nicely. Now here, you have to push back your fingers. This is very important. And your thumb so that there's a proper pressure. Now put down your head as far as possible. And this now, turn your hand, clockwise, very slowly at this point. Please put down your head, first of all, put down your hear.

 

Now... Now, push back your fingers, push back, otherwise you cannot. Now seven times you have to move. Push it, don't move your hand as the scalp. Move your scalp. Good. Seven times. That's all we have to do. You will know, that today, tonight only you have to do this. You don't have to do it later on, you don't have to remember anything. Is once you are a realized soul, you are very different. Like, when you have to climb the steps, you see, you have to climb. But once you are up there, you don't climb any, that's all. Once you reach that state you don't have to do. But in any way if you go to the centres they'll explain to you everything they'll tell you everything and nobody is going to charge any money. Maybe they might charge some nominal for the maintenance of a certain place, maybe. But so far, as I know, that mostly it is done by the people who are already Sahaja Yogis or by the centre itself. Because after all we have to pay for this hall. And they have organized that money. Last time I payed. This time, I think, I don't know how they managed to make that arrangement. And they repaid Me also. So this is the Sahaja Yogis who feel that they have to do something for you. They do it themselves and organize it. But you will not be put to any pressure or anything, and you are not responsible for paying anything, at all. Now, so now, we'll have to close our eyes. We better take out our spectacles, because you are not to open your eyes till I tell you. Just take out your spectacles. Also good for the eyesight. Now, you don't have to say any mantras, any prayer, nothing. And you don't have to force your attention to anything. Automatically will happen. You just leave it alone, your attention, your thoughts. Don't worry if there are thoughts, doesn't matter. Everything will be cleared out by the Kundalini. All right.

 

Now, please put your right hand on your heart, both the feet away from each other, left hand on your lap comfortably. And now close your eyes. On this center of the heart you have to ask a very fundamental question in your heart. It's like a computer working out you can say. You have to ask a question in your heart. You can call Me, Shri Mataji, or you can call Me, Mother, whatever you like. Ask a question three times in your heart, "Mother am I the Spirit?". Ask this question in your heart. As I told you, if you become the Spirit, you become your own master. So now please take your hand, on the left hand side of your abdomen, on the upper abdomen. Here, press it hard and here you ask another important question three times, "Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times. As I have told you I cannot force your Realization on you. In the same way, I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now, please take your hand, in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here is a center, which has got six petals. So, six times, you have to ask, "Mother please give me pure knowledge". As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, Kundalini starts rising. So we have to clear out the upper centers, with our full self confidence. Please know that you are at the epitome of evolution, as human beings, and have full confidence in yourself. In no way degrade yourself and feel inferior to anyone. So now raise your right hand, in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and press it hard. Here you have to say with self-confidence ten times, "Mother I am my own master". Please say it ten times. I have already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, these emotions, this ego, these conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit.

 

So now raise your right hand on your heart, and here you have to say, with full confidence twelve times, "Mother I am the pure Spirit". Please say it twelve times. You have to accept your position first of all. You see, before taking the throne, the king has to say that "I accept the throne". In the same way. Please say it twelve times, "Mother I am the pure Spirit". You have to know that this All Pervading Power of Divine Love is the ocean of love, compassion and bliss. It is the ocean of absolute knowledge. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you have committed, can be easily dissolved into this great ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself. You have no business to in any way, condemn yourself. So now, raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your head to your right. Here, you have to say sixteen times, with full confidence again, "Mother I am not guilty at all". I find this is the worst center today catching, here, in England. Say it emphatically, "I am not guilty at all". Again, I have told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive you are not doing anything, logically. But if you don't forgive you play into wrong hands. And as it is you have suffered because of that, while the person who has troubled you is quite happy. So now, at this point, you have to forgive all of them, not thinking about them, in general.

 

So now raise your hand, to your forehead across and put down your head, as far as possible. Here, you have to say, from your heart, not how many times, from your heart, "Mother I forgive everyone in general", Now, for your own satisfaction. Please don't count your mistakes and don't feel guilty, but for your own satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power. So now take back your right hand, on the backside of your head, and push back your head as far as possible. Here, you have to say, "Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me, if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly". This also you have to say from your heart, not how many times. Now, the last centre is the most important one. For that you have to stretch your palm and put the centre of your palm, on top of the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone on your childhood. And now put down your head. Press it hard. Push back your fingers. Now, put down your head please, push back your fingers, it's very important. Again, I am sorry, I cannot force Self Realization on you. You have to ask for it. So now please move, move your hand, or I would say, move your scalp, slowly, seven times, clockwise, saying seven times, "Mother please give me my Self Realization". You have to ask for it. None can force it on you. Seven times. Now, please, take down your hands. Now, put both the hands towards Me like this, and watch Me without thinking. Watch Me without thinking.

 

Now, please put the right hand like this, and bend your head, and with the left hand see if there's a cool breeze, coming out of your head, out of your fontanel bone area. Bend your head and see for yourself. Some people get it hot, some will get it cold. Some will get it close to the head, and some far away. But don't put it on top of the head, but away from it, and see for yourself, moving your left hand, if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Bend your heads please. Now, please take left hand and bend your head, and see for yourself, if there's a cool, or a hot air, coming out of your fontanel bone area. Some people can get it very far, you know, some people get it closer. Now, again, with your right hand. Please put your right hand towards Me. Now, again, bend your head and see for yourself. Little far away, some people get it. Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky, and put your head up there, like this, and ask a question, anyone of these questions, three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" or, "Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love?" or, "Mother is this the Ruh or Brahmachaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions, in your heart, only three times, anyone of them. Now, please take down your hands. You'll feel very relaxed. And now put your hands like this. Those who have felt the cool breeze or a hot air from their fontanel bone area, or on their fingertips, or on their hands, please raise both your hands. May God bless you.

 

That's it! All of you have got it. Now, believe in yourself, have faith in yourself, that you have got it. And don't waste your Self Realization. It's very peaceful, and all the miracles will start happening in your lives. So many will say that they have got so many miracles in their lives. But the most important thing, that you become a universal being, you become a collective being, and then you realize what a potential you had within yourself. Respect yourself and respect your Self Realization. So may God bless you all. You have got pamphlets I am told, where you got the addresses, of all the centres we have. Please look after your Self Realization. Those who have not felt so clearly, should not doubt and go and see for yourself. In those centres they will help you, explain to you, everything. Please understand that you have to grow. This is the beginning which has to grow. May God bless you.

 

Sahaja Yogi: So if I could have your attention again, just for one moment. When you came in with your ticket, you should have been given a blue piece of paper. On this, we have the details of the follow-up meetings which we've arranged. They are Sunday 27-th of June, that's this coming Sunday, at 3 p.m., and on Tuesday, next Tuesday, the 29-th, at 7.30 p.m., and the place is the Remembrance Hall, Flood street, in Chelsea. On the back of the leaflets, there are details of all the meetings which are held throughout London, every week. These are regular meetings which happen every week, and as Shri Mataji has said, we very strongly recommend that you come to these meetings and we can show you how to meditate at home, how to feel the chakras, how to clear the chakras, and how to balance the system. If you are from outside of London, there are contact phone numbers throughout the country. If you didn't get one of these leaflets we'll arrange to have them available, at the main entrance. Thank you very much.
