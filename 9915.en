I think it’s like a lotus in France, in old kingdom.Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Thank you very much.Michel C.: No thank you, Mother.Shri Mataji: So, can you keep it? Thank you.

It’s quite cold still. The wind will blow away the clouds. As soon as I came out here, it plays, you see, it plays some tricks with you all the time.[Laughter]Yes, better have him covered. And you too wear something warm.I hope you are all warm enough.

I am so happy and joyous to be here with so many Sahaja Yogis, and so many of them are very new; not very new to Me, perhaps I have known all of you, thousands of years back.

[Shri Mataji is laughing] You are sitting in the sun.

In Sahaja Yoga you all have to understand one simple thing, that you are the Spirit. And whatever is not the Spirit, is not yourself. We can compare Spirit with the sun. The sun can be covered with the clouds, there could be superimpositions on the sun, but sun remains as it is, at its point. You cannot enlighten the sun. It is illumined by itself. Now, when the clouds are removed, the superimpositions are removed, the sun shines through the atmosphere. So, our Spirit is also, is superimposed by ignorance.

As long as there is superimposition, you can't see the Spirit. And even when few clouds disappear the superimposition exists. One has to have a clear sky to see the light of the Spirit shining through. There are many ways by which we can try to remove the clouds. The first and the foremost thing is the assumption, the faith that you are the spirit and that the rest is superimposition. You have to assume that within yourself. After Realization it should become very easy that you are something much more, something very different from what you have known so far. So, now the new situation arises that you do not have a blind faith, but you have a faith that has come out of an experience. So, your intellect should not fight it. It should not try to challenge it. If it challenges and if you heed to your intellect, you'll again go down.

Even if you get the glimpse of a star in the sky, then the scientists believe that there is a star. So, in the same manner, even if you get the glimpse of your Realization, you have to at least believe that you are also a Spirit. You go on sticking on to that experience and keeping your attention on the fact that you are the Spirit. Tell your intellect not to cheat you anymore. You can turn the face of your intellect by this. Now your intellect will start working for the pursuit of the Spirit. This is what faith means. Faith gives rise to pure intelligence. Now, when you are seeing clouds removed to a great extent, still there are clouds. So you have to use the wind to remove the clouds, wind of the Holy Ghost. And that, you know, there are many ways of taking advantage of the wind.

I hope the Italians understand.

So, the wind comes from some other source, that is the source of the Holy Ghost, your own Kundalini. And also, you have in person the Primordial Kundalini before you. Compared to many other seekers who came before you, I must say, you are very fortunate. Because worshipping any "vigraha", any - even a statue of self-created vibrations from the Mother Earth, people had big problems. They had to, first of all, do a meditation which was called as "Savikalpa Samadhi". That means, in that state you had to concentrate on such a statue, "vigraha". "Vigraha" means the one which is a vibrating statue.

And then, go on looking at that statue and trying to raise your Kundalini. And Kundalini used to come up to Agnya. But the jumping beyond the Sahasrara was an impossible task, because one had to go from form to formless, and it was so difficult to get out of form to formless. And even to concentrate on abstract or formless was another impossible task as the Muslim did, or many other people tried to do.

Under these circumstances it was necessary that the formless had to take a form, so there was no more complication to you. As soon as you concentrated on the form, you became formless. Like if you have ice before you, and as soon as you start touching the ice, it melts away, and you start feeling the cool. So the problem is very easily solved now.

Puja is one of the things by which you can excite the forms into formless. Now, your centers are the centers of energies. But they too have a guiding deity sitting on all these chakras. They are also the formless made into forms. And when you do the puja, the forms melt into formless energy, and this formless energy then starts flowing, and that, then blows the wind. And that's how this misidentification, superimpositions on the Spirit are removed.

Now, you cannot think about the puja. The whole thing happens in a realm which is beyond thinking. So, you have to understand that you cannot rationalize the puja. You should have the maximum advantage on your chakras. For that you must fully just concentrate on the puja and how the wind is blowing. And the wind will see to it, that they drive out all the clouds.

So, your only work is, or your only method is just to concentrate on the puja, and witness. You are a "seer". "Seer" has double meaning. The one who sees only, just sees, and is only knowledge, is a seer. Without any thought, without any reaction, just sees and absorb, automatically, spontaneously, is the seer. And so, that is the best way to perform a puja.

For Me sometimes it's burdensome, because there should be some parity between you and the deities. Some balance must be there. Here you are saying all the mantras and the deities are awakened, and there you are, who do not want to receive anything within your heart. So, I am the one who has to store up all the extra energy that is produced in the body.

So, it would be better if you all keep your hearts open and watch the puja without thinking about it. Today we'll reverse the method of puja. First, we'll do the havana and then the puja, will be better. Because by that we'll evoke the fire element, which burns away all the evils. When you wash My feet, you do the same thing. And even when you evoke the fire, you do the same thing. So today first we'll have the havana and then we'll have the puja. Both are just the same. You can worship Me with water or with fire.

The essence of fire is the glow, "tejas". All that is wrong, all that is evil is burned out, and then the glow shows on the faces and the body of the seekers. And also atmosphere is charged with the beautiful vibrations when you have the havana. So, I think best thing will be to do the havan first and then the puja.

May God bless you all!

Of course, always we have to praise Ganesha before starting any puja, so you start praising Shri Ganesha.

Alexandre: Mother, we have learned the Ganesha "Atvatham Shirsham".Shri Mataji: Atharva, Atharvashirsha. Ganesha Atharvashirsha.Alexandre: Then we’ll say in French, or in English, I don’t know, up to You.Shri Mataji: All right, say it in French.Or better to translate it because there are other people.Alexandre: OK.Shri Mataji: First English and then French.Alexandre: And first, in Sanskrit we don’t say, Mother?Shri Mataji: It’s all right, I can understand English all right.[Laughter]It’s all mantras for Me to understand.Alexandre: Shri Ganesha.

But those who haven’t got these things in the hand should take up just their hand like that, thinking that they have it in their hand, and moving it upward like that and put it in the fire.
