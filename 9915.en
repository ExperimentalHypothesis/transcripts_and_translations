“Importance of Puja and Havan”. Paris (France), 18 June 1983

Please be seated.

Hello, so we were waiting for you to come. So, I think, get My sweater. Hello, we were waiting for you to come, for Christopher to come here. How is he? Very good. What's happened to his head? Changing of milk Shri Mother. So Christopher you are back, here? You must cover his head. It's very cold still.

All right. All right. All right. What's the matter? He is in meditation. You must keep him close, all the time. Better cover him more. No, get something more from inside. I think you also wear your sweater or something. It's rather cold outside.

Cover him much more on the head. SY: This is a present from the Austrian Sahaja Yogis. Austrian Sahaja Yogis to the French Sahaja Yogis. It's beautiful. “And I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse”. SM: Translate in French. At last I also bring My sweater. Jenny you can bring. Sweater for Shri Mataji. SY: Mother I have a gift, two gifts for you.

First from Rouen we offer You the [unclear] where You meet us Saturday. And the armour of the town. SM: Oh, I see. SY: The blazon of the town of Rouen. SM: What's that? SY: The blazon of the city, of Rouen. SM: And what are these marks about? SY: Three lilies. SM: Lilies? SY: I think it's like a lotus in France, in old kingdom.

SM: Beautiful. Thank you very much. Can you keep it? It's quite cold today. The wind will blow away the clouds. As soon as I came out here. It plays, you see it plays some tricks with you all the time. Yes, better have him covered. And you too wear something warm. I hope you are all warm enough.

I am so happy and joyous to be here with so many Sahaja Yogis, and so many of them are very new... not very new to Me, perhaps I have known all of you, thousands of years back. You are sitting in the sun. In Sahaja Yoga you all have to understand one simple thing — that you are the spirit. And whatever is not the spirit is not yourself. We can compare spirit with the sun. The sun can be covered with the clouds, there could be superimpositions on the sun, but sun remains as it is, at its point. You cannot enlighten the sun. It is illumined by itself. Now, when the clouds are removed, the superimpositions are removed, the sun shines through the atmosphere. So, our spirit is also is superimposed by ignorance.

As long as there is superimposition, you can't see the spirit. And even when few clouds disappear the superimposition exists. One has to have a clear sky to see the light of the spirit shining through. There are many ways by which we can try to remove the clouds. The first and the foremost thing is the assumption, the faith that you are the spirit and that the rest is superimposition. You have to assume that within yourself — after Realization it should become very easy — that you are something much more, something very different from what you have known so far. So, now the new situation arises — that you do not have a blind faith, but you have a faith that has come out of an experience. So your intellect should not fight it. It should not try to challenge you - it. If it challenges and if you're ill to your intellect, you'll again go down.

Even if you get the glimpse of a star in the sky, then the scientists believe that there is a star. So, in the same manner, even if you get the glimpse of your Realization, you have to at least believe that you are also a spirit. You go on sticking on to that experience and keeping your attention on the fact that you are the spirit. Tell your intellect not to cheat you anymore. You can turn the face of your intellect by this. Now your intellect will start working for the pursuit of the spirit. This is what faith means. Faith gives rise to pure intelligence. Now, when you are seeing clouds removed to a great extent, still there are clouds. So you have to use the wind to remove the clouds.

Wind of the Holy Ghost. And that... you know, there are many ways of taking advantage of the wind. I hope the Italians understand. So the wind comes from some other source, that is the source of the Holy Ghost, your own Kundalini. And also you have in person the Primordial Kundalini before you. Compared to many other seekers who came before you, I must say, you are very fortunate. Because worshipping any vigraha, any... even a statue of self-created vibrations from the Mother Earth, people had big problems. They had to, first of all, do a meditation which was called as Savikalpa Samadhi. That means, in that state you had to concentrate on such a statue, vigraha. Vigraha means the one which is a vibrating statue.

And then, go on looking at that statue and trying to raise your Kundalini. And Kundalini used to come up to Agnya. But the jumping beyond the Sahastrara was an impossible task, because one had to go from form to formless, and it was so difficult, to get out of form to formless. And even to concentrate on abstract or formless was another impossible task as the Muslim did, or many other people tried to do. Under these circumstances it was necessary that the formless had to take a form, so there was no more complication to you. As soon as you concentrated on the form, you became formless. Like if you have ice before you, and as soon as you start touching the ice, it melts away, and you start feeling the cool. So the problem is very easily solved now. Puja is one of the things by which you can excite the forms into formless. Now, your centers are the centers of energies.

But they, too, have a guiding deity sitting on all these chakras. They are also the formless made into forms. And when you do the puja, the forms melt into formless energy, and this formless energy then starts flowing, and that, then blows the wind. And that's how this misidentification, superimpositions on the spirit are removed. Now, you cannot think about the puja. The whole thing happens in a realm which is beyond thinking. So, you have to understand that you cannot rationalize the puja. You should have the maximum advantage on your chakras. For that you must fully just concentrate on the puja and how the wind is blowing. And the wind will see to it, that they drive out all the clouds.

So your only work is, or your only method is — just to concentrate on the puja, and witness. You are a seer. Seer has double meaning. The one who sees only, just sees, and is only knowledge — is a seer. Without any thought, without any reaction, just sees and absorb, automatically, spontaneously — is the seer. And so, that is the best way to perform a puja. For Me sometimes it's burdensome, because there should be some parity between you and the deities. Some balance must be there. Here you are saying all the mantras and the deities are awakened, and there you are, who do not want to receive anything within your heart. So I am the one who has to store up all the extra energy that is produced in the body.

So it would be better if you all keep your hearts open and watch the puja without thinking about it. Today we'll reverse the method of puja. First we'll do the havana and then the puja, will be better. Because by that we'll evoke the fire element, which burns away all the evils. When you wash My feet, you do the same thing. And even when you evoke the fire, you do the same thing. So today first we'll have the havana and then we'll have the puja. Both are just the same. You can worship Me with water or with fire. The essence of fire is the glow, tejas.

All that is wrong, all that is evil is burned out, and then the glow shows on the faces and the body of the seekers. And also atmosphere is charged with the beautiful vibrations when you have the havana. So I think best thing will be to do the havan first and then the puja. May God bless you all! Of course always we have to praise Ganesha before starting the puja, so you start praising Shri Ganesha. SY: Mother, we have learned the Ganesha Atharva Shersha. Atharva... Atharvashirsha. Ganesha Atharvashirsha. YOGI: Then we'll say [UNCLEAR] in French, or in English [UNCLEAR], as You like. All right, say it in French.

Or better to translate it because there are other people. First English and then French. And first, Sanskrit we can say, Mother. It's all right, I can understand English all right. Is all mantras for Me to understand. The holy mantras of Shri Mataji. Beautiful. [UNCLEAR] beautiful. It’s good. All right.

And now we'll be having the fire. It's all right. Come along. You can look after the fire. Let others see the fire. SY: Mother, [first should] we recite Your names or names of Shri Vishnu? SY: Vishnu, Vishnu’s names?SM: Yes, Vishnu’s names. SY: 108 names of Vishnu? SM: It would be better I think His names.Have you got 1000 names? SY: Not, 108 names.

SY: 108. Mother is asking for 1000. We have LalitaSahasranama. SM: But who knows Sanskrit?It’s in Hindi?SY: It’s written in French. SM: All right, then it’s all right. SY: The vibrated coconut. Now you put some water in it and [PUT?] it to all the people, now. Today I would say that from France those who came to see Me, from all these places, one from each center should come forward. One from Bretagne.

These are too big, I think. You can put the bigger ones to make a triangle first, [UNCLEAR]around it. 00:53:38:14 The bigger ones. Maria? The triangle [ON] the three sides. One on top of another, this be better. Yes, it’s closer, yes, that’s why. SY: Would You like some tea? Or... Mother, water. You don’t want water?

Yes, Mother. [UNCLEAR]. Something like a... [UNCLEAR] paper like a... thing, something lighter... Is that the light thing? And have you got camphor with you? Something lighter to be, underneath. Do you have anything [UNCLEAR]? Make it smaller, smaller [UNCLEAR]. Yes. Put it on top of this thing, not underneath. Not underneath, put it on top.

Covering this. Yes, put these... on top. Yes, like that, yes, that's the right ting. You have to keep a hole in between. Arrange it in such a way there is a hole in between, in the center. Now arrange on top of this. Now, this is all right. Please cover with this [UNCLEAR]. I think there should be a platform first. There should be a platform first — and then.

In the center there should be a platform. Yes make a platform there, yes, down here. And on the platform,... just wait... Marcus, on the platform you put another thing. That's better, yeah. Do you have some more with you? [UNCLEAR] To begin with that's sufficient. SY: Mother we have Vishnu SahasranamaStotram and Shri Lalita. SM: But it should be in Sanskrit. SY: Now there is, also here it’s written in... SM: You can read that. SY: Yes.

This is Vishnu’s names? You'd like to do 108, would you? What we do, we can do 108 of the Goddess and 108 of Shri Vishnu, that's the best. SY: All right, Mother. All right. SM: And one from Paris also. A new person. SY: Patrice, Patrice is from Paris. SM: Children, please... Keep the children outside. Mother, we read the 108 names translated in French in the form of a poem.

Now, can you put something for Me there? SY: You want to sit here, on the chair? SM: Some chair. Vanessa you come here. You come and sit here,this side. You come this side. All the children can sit next to Me. Shall we say the mantra for the fire, Mother? We have to say together Shri Agni Devata, who is the Devi... Be careful about it. Don’t be too near.

Little far away. Now say the mantra. Shri Agni Devata who is a Devi, the aspect of fire in Shri Mataji. Shri SwahaSwamini who is a principle of... which consumes everything. Swa-ha. It’s moving in all the directions. SM: What is the...? SY: SwahaSwamini. Swa-ha. Swaha is the quality of the... of the fire Now, after every name that he takes you have to take the thing from your hand like this, and take it round to the right side and put it in the fire.

But those who haven't got these things in the hand should take up just their hand like that, thinking that they have it in their hand, and moving it upward like that and put it in the fire. And you all should say "Swaha". Now, just a minute. After every name, after every name. SY: The 108 names of Shri Vishnu. Yes, Mother, it’s all right? SM: First the Devi. SY: First the Devi. Now we'll do the Vishnu Sahasranama, hundred and eight. Again you distribute the [nuclear], distribute it.

What’s the time now? SY: The time? It’s 2o’clock. We have only to be at6.30 here to[entice] later on. But You don’t need to be there as early. We can arrive before you and give a practical session to the people. SM: You see these people who want to meet are always[barking], always. SY: Yes, that’s true.SM: One fellow has got back pain. SY: Yes, that thing like that. SM: He’s the only one who had.

You bring the oil and all that and you can massage him. SY: Yes, all right. We’ll give him a treatment. No problem. I think we can manage. Some people can go there and give them a practical session Mother. how to meditate in Sahaja Yoga, how to work on themselves... SM: So I said, 21 names of Vishnu are sufficient.. SY: It’s all right, Mother. O.k. Now the... first you [UNCLEAR] this, finish it [INAUDIBLE]. For that you have to use some sort of a fruit.

Last thing. Do you have something? What is the special fruit of France? YOGI: The special fruit of France? Apples! SHRI MATAJI: Apples, or you should have... YOGI: Stem berries... cherries, cherries and grape, grape, Mother! SHRI MATAJI: Grape is the best. YOGI: [UNCLEAR] just to bless it, Mother. SY: Just to bless it, Mother. SM: That’s the reason.

SHRI MATAJI: So now, this is the ultimate puja we have done now. SM: You bring it here, bring it here. This is the end of the puja, is finished, throw all that in there. All the... all the remaining things are to be thrown. Yes, put it. Now, we have put today the grapes in it. That means the grapes will loose their capacity to ferment. That's the best. It's a big wind blowing! So let’s then have our lunch and do the Puja inside as outside it’s very cold.

The main thing [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR] [Hindi]. YOGI: Mother, the dinner is not ready... the lunch is not ready. SHRI MATAJI: Not ready, is it? YOGI: Not, yes. In one hour, in one hour. SHRI MATAJI: So, we'll finish the puja?

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
