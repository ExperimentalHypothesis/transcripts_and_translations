Navaratri Puja, "Your Beautiful Qualities will prove the Truth of Sahaja Yoga". Cabella (Italy), 5 October 1997.

"There have been many incarnations of the Goddess for different, different purposes." When the great saints who were worshiping the Mother introspected, they found out what She has done for us. Within us She has established dharma, the innate valency of human beings. But we deviate from dharma and all manner of problems come in, because to leave dharma is not a human quality.

The Goddess Herself has done so many things for us. The saints have said, "Ya Devi Sarvabhuteshu." For all those you have created. "What do You do? As what do You exist inside the human beings?" "Introspect to see if you have these qualities within you or not. They are given to You by the Goddess, by the Shakti within you."

For instance "Ya Devi Sarvabhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthitah." You exist within human beings as Peace. Do you find human beings who are peaceful within and without? It is very difficult. But, She has given you that Peace which you have to achieve. If you have fallen off your human dharmas you have no Peace. So this Peace that She has given you, you have to achieve through your ascent, through the Kundalini awakening.

The second quality is "Ya Devi Sarvabhuteshu Vritti rupena samsthitah." Vritti is the quality of loving. Human beings have been given the quality of loving, but it is not there because of nonsensical things human beings have such as jealousy. "Supposing I give some present to somebody and some present to another one. Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel jealous." There will be jealousy about why does Mother not come to my country if She can go to that country? How can you feel jealous, when the Goddess has given you the quality to love?

As Sahaja Yogis you should not be jealous. Instead, that quality of loving should be shown. If you are very jealous, you are not a Sahaja Yogi blessed by Shri Mataji. "If you are blessed, then you will have no jealousy whatsoever." Jealousy comes also from the ignorance that "this is mine, this is yours." We do not realize also that the Goddess has given us the tremendous power to love. Love cannot be an inauspicious power. The auspicious, dharmic power to love somebody means without any lust and greed, without any jealousy.

The human mind has developed in such a cunning manner that it is proud it can be jealous of someone. Out of this jealousy comes greed. You feel jealous, so you want to buy the same thing. If somebody has a job better than yours, you must compete. These things are all destructive, but the powers given by the Goddess are absolutely constructive.

Then the saints have said, "Ya Devi Sarvabhuteshu Shama rupena samsthitah." Shama is forgiveness from the heart. "All right, somebody has been cruel to you, has been nasty to you, has exploited you, has troubled you. But you have the power, greater power, to forgive. Do we use that power to forgive? "

Then for relaxing the Goddess gives you sleep. "Ya Devi, Sarvabhuteshu. Nidra rupena samsthitah." When you are tired and you cannot sleep, She makes you sleep by relaxing you. "The power of relaxation She does because She acts through parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system can excite you, can depress you, but the parasympathetic relaxes you, relaxes your heart, relaxes your body; and completely you feel relaxed and sleepy in the lap of your Mother."

There are many people who cannot sleep because they are thinking about something they have to achieve. "If you cannot sleep, then something is wrong with you. And when you cannot sleep, I also cannot sleep." Whatever happens collectively also works on Me. "You cannot sleep because you are thinking of things which are of no value." In Sahaja Yoga we know that to overcome sleeplessness we have to go into thoughtless awareness.

The most interesting thing that the Mother has put into you is "Ya Devi Sarvabhuteshu Bhranti rupena samsthitah." She puts you into delusion because sometimes Her children cannot understand unless and until they face delusion. "She allows you to go wrong to a point where you discover you are lost." This is Mahamaya that we get lost with this delusion.

We have the delusion of ego. Ego makes men believe that they are very powerful, that they can do what they like and are not going to be punished for it. Women, too, behave in the same manner. "They do not understand that this is a delusion the Mother has given to us in order for us to find out that we are in the wrong." If you tell somebody "this is wrong - don't do it," they will go on doing wrong things because they are not yet mature. So the Mother says "all right, go on, very nice, very good. You want to jump in the sea? Jump! ." When you realize that you have been in a delusion, then you can return back. Otherwise, without any problem, you cannot return.

"So many of you are so obstinate, so self-conscious. Whatever I may tell you, you will not listen. Whatever way I may try to convince you, on a mental level you won't be convinced. The bhranti, the delusion, is beyond the mind. It works out well for difficult people.

A Mother doesn't want Her child to be ruined, naturally. She feels responsible and She thinks, "Now they have got connection with the Divine and this connection should not be broken. They should be all the time blessed and be happy." All this is built within us from our very childhood, but we forget. Slowly, slowly we start losing it. Maybe the conditioning is such, maybe ego is such, or maybe they forget that they are realized souls.

"I am talking to you, to people who are realized souls. I am not talking to people who are already lost or who may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga." You have been told very sweetly, with love, with affection, with kindness. If you don't understand that, then you go into bhranti.

It is also said that "Ya Devi Sarvabhuteshu lajja rupena samsthitah." Lajja is difficult to describe. It is not shyness. It is a kind of shame about your body. Lajja is especially for women. As children, women are very shy. You see little girls who are very shy. " That shyness gradually disappears. But in the beginning they are even shy of Me. They come before Me and they'll put down their heads."

I remember my granddaughter once saw in a magazine a lady in a swimming dress. She said to that lady, "What are you doing? Better wear your dress otherwise my Grandma will come and hit you hard." And then she saw a man dressed with just small little knickers. She said, "This one seems to be an absolutely shameless fellow. He is going to have a bad time now." She closed the magazine and told the maidservant, "Burn this. I don't want to see it!" Such a little girl yet she knew that it was wrong.

Nowadays we are going about showing our bodies. People wear such little clothes these days there is no space for an artist to show his art. In Japan I asked them, "How is it you wear these dresses, these kimonos, done so well, very expensive, and it takes time to wear that?" So they said, "You see, if God has made a beautiful body, then it is His art and we have to make our art to decorate it."

In India, a lady has to wear a sari which has been made very artfully, very beautifully, just to decorate her body, just to respect the body. But, this seems to have gone with the influence of America where they are brainless people, absolutely brainless. There is nothing to learn from them. "Only two hundred year old people and we start behaving in their manner. We don't see even what is happening in their country, what sort of people they are. How they live . . . What is their goal in life. Every false guru has exploited them because they are brainless . . . They have brains for running a computer . . . but as far as their own bodies are concerned, they don't know how to manage."

"In India they had a beauty competition and many sensible people opposed it because it is like selling your body and making money. What is the difference between prostitution and this? If you get money by selling your body, then it is prostitution. You are not supposed to sell your body. That is not what the Goddess has done to you."

You should dress up well. Different, different occasions are there. For those occasions you have to dress up appropriately. "In India when the women go to the temples or to worship the idols . . . they will wear all that is necessary to face the Goddess. Imagine people coming for this program here wearing . . . clothes like hippies. What would happen to Me? I would disappear in thin air I can tell you this."

One has to have respect for the Goddess. Now you might give the justification that there are people who are taking a bath in the river, and this and that. "But you are saints, you are realized souls. You do not have to see those people who are not yet realized and who are misbehaving. You must do what a saint should do."

Another quality the Goddess has given you is Shuddha. She is the one who has given us hunger. We have to eat our food. Nowadays there is a fashion of becoming thin. And you know so many diseases have developed because women want to eat little. It is not the aim of life to only look after your body. The body is not the only important thing. What is important is your spirit.

The Goddess is the one who gives you the Kundalini. She is the one who gives you a method by which you will ascend. But all the time Her children are worried about their bodies "This is something I cannot understand. Especially the women, who are the shakti."

Then another point is that they follow a fashion. Fashion is madness. In India also fashion started. They used to increase the size of the sleeves, then decrease the size of the sleeves. Then some went up to here. Why waste money like this? When you have a traditionally accepted design, why do you want to go on increasing and decreasing the size of your sleeves according to the fashion? Has the Devi made the fashion? Who makes the fashion? These hungry, greedy people who are befooling you make the fashion.

I have told you that you must put oil in your head. At least on Saturday, put sufficient oil and then wash your hair. But you will not do that, and then you start losing your hair. Why not do something that is needed to look after yourself? For the sake of thinning down, you'll lose your hair, your eyesight, and your teeth. Soon you'll become an old hag. Same with the men. Nowadays, men are going to beauty parlor I'm told. There is no need if you lead a good, healthy life. "You have to exercise and meditate. If you meditate you become peaceful. With that peace you'll be amazed you'll have so much of energy."

So much energy is wasted in thinking. Now what do you think? If you ask somebody, "What are you thinking?" " Everything." But everything means what? Why do you think so much? What is the need to think? "It is a . . . human habit, to go on thinking about everything. For example, just now there are three carpets here. Now, if I put attention on it, I'll just see how nice they are, I'll just enjoy what the artists have done. That's all. No words, just the enjoyment within." But if you ask somebody else, they'll say, "Oh, this is not good. That is not good. This much price, that price, this thing, that thing." The joy if that artist is finished. You cannot feel that joy we are seeking. Thinking is a reaction that makes the life of the person who thinks so miserable.

Thinking too much is a sign of ego. People who think too much will never hit the solution, because they are just discussing, arguing, thinking. They have no solutions. Sahaja yogis have to introspect, to look inward and ask, "Why am I thinking?' "What am I thinking?" "What is the need to think?"

"You will become nirvichara. Don't allow your mind to befool you. This mind is like a monkey." It makes you jump from this end to that end. If you reach some conclusion and it is not achieved, then you are the most miserable person.

You can see what comes out of this thinking on a global level also. "What is the need to go to the moon? So many people are starved, are dying out. What is the need to go to Mars? What are they going to get from there? Because they formed a habit. First they came to India. Then went to China. Then went to this, then went to that. They can't settle down. They can't settle down in the house, also. Especially men. If you are traveling by train, even if train stops for two minutes, men must get out. The wife will be worried now. And while the train will be moving, train moving, then they'll jump. It's a cracked brain, I think." In meditation, you have to sit down in one place, not to jump here to there.

Women have other problems. While cooking, they'll meditate. They have no time. They have their friends. They have to go to shopping, to buy things and fill the house with all kinds of rubbish. They are also very adventurous. They want to do business. They want to do this and that. Yet for meditation, they have no time.

So settling down is very important. Once someone told Me, "Mother, if we settle down, we'll become very fat." It doesn't matter. There are all sorts of excuses not to meditate. "Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know, it's so difficult in these modern times. There is crisis in our lives, problems in our lives."

When there is a crisis in my family or in Sahaja Yoga, I immediately become thoughtless. "Spontaneously I become thoughtless, because the problem will be solved by the Paramchaitanya. Why should I think? Let the Paramchaitanya look (after the problem). If you don't depend on your Paramchaitanya, it doesn't help, doesn't give you any solution."

"You have to know definitely that you are connected to the All-pervading Power of Divine Love. This is not love which is stupid. (This is) Love that thinks, Love that is Truth, Love that is Joy. All this is built in within you now you have got realization."

"I was recently told that we have lost about 100 Sahaja yogis because they started following another Sahaja yogi who started seeing things. So they also wanted to see. If you can see something, that means you are not there. If I am on the top of a mountain, then I am there. But if I am away from the mountain, then I can see. The more you see something, that means you are away from it. Did you follow this point?" So the subtle, suksha, state is where you are yourself that. How can you see yourself? Because you are that, you cannot see. Such people, who are very popular sometimes in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, try to control you and befool you. Then you are thrown out. This is what we call the judgement.

"There are sieves and sieves and sieves through which you have to pass. Where you get enamored by this or that, or you fall for this or that . . . you are arriving at that point where your destruction is sure. You have to become the Spirit. You have to rise in spiritual life. If your movement is downward, who can help you? "

This is a very interesting time. It is the time of judgement. We have to be careful that we are our own judges. Nobody has to tell you that you're catching on this chakra or catching on that one. You, yourself, can feel what chakras are catching. Although I may try on my own to suck in all your problems and do whatever is possible to keep you rising, I feel this method of helping you will not make you so strong. You will always think, "after all, Mother will suck my problem."

"If I get one hundred letters, out of them ninety-nine are of Sahaj yogis who are suffering from this trouble or that trouble. I am amazed. You have all these qualities already awakened in you. They are in you. Use them!" You have got the power of Forgiveness and of Truth. You know reality much more than those saints who have praised the Goddess. If you could just think as to what level you are sitting, you would not fall. "Only problem is that you have to know that your ascent has to be spiritual, and already these qualities are very well balanced and put within you." These powers are never destroyed within you.

With the Kundalini awakening, all these beautiful qualities you have will manifest. Your beautiful being, which is enlightened by the spirit, will prove to the world that Sahaja Yoga is the Truth. But, it should not be a mental satisfaction within you that, "I have got the Self-realization. Now I am this." No, it is not mental. It's a state. And to achieve that state you have to really meditate and find time for meditation every night, every morning.

The more you meditate, the better it will be. No excuses are to be given. Everything else is unimportant. "Your ascent is very important if you really want to save this world in this Kali Yuga. I think today I have made it very clear to you what qualities already are instilled within you. They are not dharmas but qualities. They are just within you. Only thing, you turn your attention to something opposite. Otherwise all these qualities are already instilled within you. They are already there. And nothing can destroy them,except for you, yourself. If you have destroyed them, nobody can help."

May God bless you!!!
