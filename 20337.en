Yogi Mahajan: [UNCLEAR] that such an honour has been bestowed upon me. It is, a singular achievement through constant hard work, endeavour, perseverance which immortalises us. And it is for this great honour that [UNCLEAR] us individuals. And which shines on us individuals, gives us inspiration that we may also endeavour and rise to their level. They are forebearers for us and show us the way.

The human history is not to be remembered for the conquests of great kings, but for the great message of peace, which great saints and sages have brought forth to us. And if we travel in this great country, we have such great [UNCLEAR/visionaries] who have lit the path for us. In the twentieth century, it was Mahatma Gandhi, followed by his disciple, the late Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. And today we have with us, Sir. C.P. Srivastava, who is the luminary for this age and from whom we draw great inspiration to lead us the way and show us the path. His achievements have been many in his very distinguished and chequered career.

And I request Shri Bahari Khosla to felicitate him and our distinguished guests who will throw light on his various aspects and achievements. Mr Bahari Khosla.

Shri Bahari Khosla.

Shri Khosla: Honourable Shri Srivastava, my beloved Mother, [UNCLEAR/name of person], Shri H.K. Garodia, President, Maratha Chamber of Commerce Industries, my respected [UNCLEAR/name of person], my dear brothers and sisters.

It is indeed a great day for all of us today, that we have one of the greatest distinguished personality through his hard work and zeal [UNCLEAR], for the past forty years. [UNCLEAR]. Earlier they had given this to Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States. I was introduced to Sir C.P. Srivastava through my friend, loving, affectionate Mother, Her Holiness Shri Mataji when I was in London in 1983. But I met him [break in recording].

[When recording resumes Sir C.P. has already started addressing the audience].

Sir C.P. Srivatasva: ...”Why do you want to go abroad? To travel around and [UNCLEAR]. That is not for us”. If I had not [UNCLEAR], I would not have been standing here and that I would GET the opportunity to serve my country – at the district level, at the state level, at the government enterprise-level and finally, at the international level.

I have been with this United Nations Maritime Organisation which I have had the privilege of serving for four terms or sixteen years. You know in the United Nations, there is a chain of inter-governmental, international organisations. Each one has its own purpose. The main U.N. is political – peace and war, as you know. On the other hand, there are [UNCLEAR/ten] organisations – the Labour Organisation is one, the International Immigration Organisation is one and so on. And one of these ten is the International Maritime Organisation. The Secretary-General of these organisations is elected by the member states. And there are eight hundred and thirty-four states, members for that organisation. And when it goes for elections, this organisation asks member states to suggest names of suitable persons.

When the post came up in 1973, my name was proposed by the Government of India. I am eternally grateful to my country. I am eternally grateful to the government of my country for so many things. But there on this occasion, we send the candidature of this person. And I was duly elected. But when the first term expired, all members unanimously decided for an extension, to re-elect me. [UNCLEAR]. They said you have to continue. And then came the third term. They again elected me unanimously. And then came the fourth term. They again elected me unanimously.

Mind you, unanimously by countries all round, developed countries, north, south, east, west, Soviet Union, America, China, France, again all countries. When it was time for the fourth term to end, I took the precaution of writing to the council of the Organisation, saying, “I am really grateful, you have given me this chance for sixteen years. Now I want to retire. And I am firm.” But again, as usual, they said no. I said, “Now I am seventy. How long will I go on?”. They said, “What is the matter? Is your health poor?”. I said, “No, I am fine. But when I retire, I want to go back to my country. I have been away for so long. There is something to be done there. I want to go back.” And eventually, they agreed. So that is how my fourth term came to an end.

Now, why did the government appreciate my work? I was kindly informed, or [UNCLEAR] kindly informed me; I want to assure you, it was not monetary, or [UNCLEAR]. All I did for sixteen years was to serve the organisation, with total commitment and dedication to promoting the activities of that organisation.

Now, a United Nations body is not a state, a responsible state. It has no powers to enforce anything. The only power a world body has is its moral authority. The moral authority vested in it by several governments. And what I did was to [UNCLEAR/serve] that organisation. And the role there is to bring all maritime nations, one hundred and thirty-four together at the forum [UNCLEAR] and try to promote co-operation from all the countries. Try to bring them round to a common point of view. So that the world should have safety, efficiency, accountability and some [UNCLEAR].

And it is a mighty task. You know, a tanker is half a million tons. One tanker would be twenty times the size of this building, perhaps. There are containers which are bulk carried. And each one of them is at least [UNCLEAR]. And my role as Secretary-General was to see [UNCLEAR/how they communicate together], across industries together. And by the spirit of goodwill, communication, to listen to each other. To come to a consensus. And we developed twenty different treaties, diplomatic treaties on these tankers. Always by consensus.

I do not believe in fighting and the United Nations system must not divide at all. The United Nations means United Nations. So if we people are accomplishing certain work, if we divide the body between developed and developing, between north and south, east and west, it would be no good to the cells of the body. That is my philosophy and possibly, it coincides with the philosophy of the member states. The said, yes, that is how it should be.

I have travelled a long [UNCLEAR/time]. I have been to many countries all over the world. And believe me, again, not one country said that they wanted [UNCLEAR]. And I have therefore seen the world at its best. And in this task, I was helped by the International Maritime team. Of course, you know, someone in Australia or Japan when he thinks of IMO, he thinks of the Secretary-General. And he thinks of, oh that Indian, the tall Indian. Not Mr Srivastava, my name is terrible, how can they remember; but they would remember an Indian. And that was my pride.

An Indian serving the world, but as a true Indian. And what is a true Indian? A true Indian who believes in India’s philosophy. And India’s philosophy is peace on earth, goodwill for all nations. And that was my [UNCLEAR].

And fortunately, all the leaders accepted my sincerity, my dedication and they listened to me. Not because I was Secretary-General, but because I was a person in whose integrity, objectivity, spiritual service, they agreed. If you are very sincere, you cannot have a posture. You can advance for one year, two years, but you will be soon found out. You have to be totally sincere. And that is how the organisation functioned for sixteen years.

Normally as with any system, there are problems [UNCLEAR]. There is all these hostilities between developed countries, under-developed countries, between the Soviet bloc, other blocs, so on. You cannot move. That is why you need the wisdom not to get [UNCLEAR]. But if I know, I generated a new phrase, where I said, I want families of the United Nations here.

[UNCLEAR]. Which is understandable for Indians. But if you go to a United Nations body and say the word family, the best they will understand is [UNCLEAR]. So initially [UNCLEAR]. The IMO countries, they accepted. So the family of nations they accepted. And so the family of nations within ourselves.

And this background I wanted to explain why so many governments of the world and the United Nations particularly, they decided to bestow upon me, a very high honour.

The U.K. as you know has very high standards of the government. And of course, to their own nationals, they give a few knighthoods each year on the Queen’s birthday. But to a non-British, it is very rare. [UNCLEAR]. If they find something extraordinary and it is my, I am greatly [UNCLEAR/indebted] to Her Majesty, the Queen of the United Kingdom that she evaluated, of course, the recommendations come from the government – that my service to the United Nations International Maritime Organisation was worthy to deserve recognition. That is how I was the recipient of the knighthood.

[Applause].

But, [UNCLEAR] other countries have given this honour to me. The King of Norway, of Sweden, the government of Germany, Brazil, Panama, I can go on with many others, but I won’t. But they all, the fact I want to suggest is, these awards are all not just because of my work, my achievements or my goodness. They came because of the goodness of these countries. The ideals of these countries.

Panama, faraway Brazil, the world honouring an Indian. It is their greatness, their goodness which is exhibited by the appreciation of my work. So I am very humbled about it, I am most grateful. I assure you I have seen the very best of the world. I have seen human beings at their best. And I travelled all over the world, I am convinced that human beings everywhere are marvellous. It is the divisions which are created by vested interests which are responsible for all the problems.

Anyway as far as I have served, now I can come back here. And I am very honoured to be in Pune. After I come back, I want to do whatever I can in my humble way, to continue with whatever service I can render. [UNCLEAR]. I have mentioned that is not my way. [UNCLEAR].

Now, back to Maharashtra, means again the same situation here. Patriotism [UNCLEAR]. And I have great support from my dear wife, who is here. When I began, She helped me in every step of the way. She helped me. She has been a wonderful wife, a great mother, a great grandmother. My grandchildren are here, coming to live with me. And She is also now, a world spiritual leader.

Sometimes I meet Sahaja Yogis in other parts of the world. And when I see them, I am amazed by them, absolutely amazed. The kind of transformation that takes place, in the British, the French, Germans, Italian. They become pure, chaste, good brothers. And I would just be [UNCLEAR] pure, chaste, good Maharashtrians. Because when they come to India, they are happy in Maharashtra. Because they find Maharashtra so conducive with their own thinking.

And I tell you this – I have served the world for more than forty years. I cannot honestly claim that I have transformed any single individual to that extent. They give up drugs, they give up alcoholism, they give up all kinds of modern cultures and lifestyles. They become true, truly sadhakas. Now if I could transform one organisation, She has transformed thousands. Actually transformed.

And when people say, what is a miracle? I say, “This is the miracle. Everyone is a [UNCLEAR/saint]”. And She recently travelled to the Soviet Union. You do not know because of She [UNCLEAR/refugee there]. And people there are so anxious, much more than other Western countries. When She went, usually, when She [UNCLEAR], there is a gathering of about a thousand people, very good gatherings. In a very few, about fifteen hundred. In the Soviet Union, She got twenty thousand. Like a stadium almost. And why? Because they are anxious to get spiritual.

They are not limited by any doctrines – like the communist doctrine or, communism [UNCLEAR]. They are ready and they had gathered around Her [UNCLEAR/and they value Her very much]. [UNCLEAR/popular] and She is being pulled around all over the world. She went to Russia, Romania, [UNCLEAR], Poland, GDR, everywhere. But still [UNCLEAR], to help me also in India.

[Laughter and applause].

I have taken lots of time, but I want to assure you what a privilege it is to be here this evening. To get this honour, is a great honour, from Pune. It is a very great honour. And the honour goes down to my [UNCLEAR], because, obviously I love Maharashtra. I love its culture, its music, its people. And when I have permission to come back to Pune, I will get to stay here. That is my biggest achievement.

And I am therefore I am feeling myself to be specially privileged, to be back here, to live here and to try to emulate [UNCLEAR]. And I have one request to make to you all. I am very excited about it. And the only point which worries me about Maharashtra, is the fact, that we do not stress that we are Indian first. And that is something which should be taken up.

And Pune should provide the lead. You provided the lead during the Independence movement. Why not take the lead to create an Indian nation? You take the lead in [UNCLEAR], everything. What I would love to see is that there a movement initiated from here, to create an Indian nation.

[UNCLEAR]. Pune would take the lead in creating an Indian nation. And that is my [UNCLEAR/dream/wish] in the pursuit of excellence. An Indian nation. I want to thank you very much.

(In Marathi): I am not fluent in Marathi.

[Applause].

I thank all the dignitaries of Pune for honouring me and Shri Mataji. Thank you so much.

[Applause].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]. I never expected in that Pune there would be such a reception for Doctor Srivastava. It is a great surprise to Me. And you know in Sahaja Yoga we have been working in Pune since a long time. And I have always been wanting to come here, to stay here, live here.

This is such a great thing, such a beautiful thing. He had thirty-one major awards. Some of them are for such an achievement, which is only worn by the king. And all these awards he got; nobody, if you ask any other Secretary-General. Nobody has got.

Now when the Secretary of State, Mr Parkinson, was asked to say, in the dinner specially held for him in the Lancaster House, which is a famous house in [UNCLEAR]. And only three days before that they had an [UNCLEAR/meeting of presidents] there.

Sir. C.P. Srivastava: Mathewson(?).

Shri Mataji: Mathewson. [UNCLEAR] was there. I mean, all the important things are done there. You see, they are very particular about it. He got up and he said, “I had heard legends Madison. But in my lifetime, I never imagined I would meet one. [UNCLEAR]. Believe me.

[Applause].

And he went on, about how telling how he got his awards, but I cannot believe that such a person exists. I have not heard of anyone in the world who has got so many awards from so many countries. She did not say anything, but somebody told her Mr Reagan had got this award. Because people have got otherwise, naturally, but they are limited. And this is the highest of all, highest award. Honorary; highest award someone can get.

Now, this we must think about this. Because of My background – my father, mother were fighters for freedom. My father was in jail for quite some time. My mother was in jail five times. And I was would be unhappy [UNCLEAR/seeing] them like that. I also had been fighting for the freedom of this country. And I was quite tortured also.

And then I heard these Britishers suddenly, imagine, to praise an Indian. I also remembered one thing. That once, Jhansi Ki Rani, she lost the battle. And a soldier, an Englishman who was fighting her, the general, he said, “We have won, but the glory goes to Jhansi Ki Rani”. The same thing, I will tell you, it is the same thing. That, to appreciate, to be enamoured by somebody’s work is so important. Because that makes the whole nation awaken to an ideal. This is what I feel.

Now, are we working like that? Are we being like that? In our country, we have had great people also. I think the great blessings of the Divine. We can take many names. [UNCLEAR]. We have had many great people. Their lives [UNCLEAR]. But after that what I find is, after that people do not follow them. They put their photograph, but nobody tries to follow them. Somehow or other, their lives do not penetrate in our being. This is what they achieve there with this kind of thing. They publicise, say things in such a manner.

Even her [UNCLEAR/daughter] she said, “Mrs Srivastava, I cannot believe such a man lives on this earth”. Just imagine, to talk like that about someone. And all this made Me feel, that we lack in appreciation. That is one thing; we are not so appreciative of somebody who works. Who dedicates his life.

Even Mahatma Gandhi’s film was made by a Britisher, on his life. Can you imagine? A Britisher should make a film on Mahatma Gandhi and our film industry, such a great film industry all over the world, they made no film on Mahatma Gandhi. If the Britishers could make it, this appreciation of an international figure – anybody it could be, whatever caste is anything – that is something very surprising about the Britishers. And that is what makes the ideal of UK, it is so important. They [UNCLEAR/know what matters] and they are asking what is the concern. So, I thought that if just Indians could be like that if Indians could just be like that, I tell you.

And that means everyone. If there is an industrialist who is working very hard, giving to the industry, doing so much for the country, doing this thing, that thing – and somebody goes and asks him [UNCLEAR/ a favour]. If he does not do the favour, they will say, he is such a bad man, cut his throat also, as if he is a [UNCLEAR].

Officers also. If any officer is good, you tell him what a good officer he is. Immediately others will [UNCLEAR]. I mean, I am your Mother, I will tell you the truth. And I think that if we can turn this. That if somebody has got some qualities, then we must appreciate and we must try to imbibe them. This is one thing lacking in us. I do not know why.

But when I was young, I saw people appreciated each other very much.

When my father was there and everyone else, all those people who were sacrificing so much for the country. They were a very different type of people. Everybody knew about everyone and the way they used to appreciate them, imbibe their qualities. Also, I would say, my husband’s bosses, who were I.C.S. (Indian Civil Service) at those times. I mean I did not think much of them, to begin with.

But then I discovered that they too had these qualities. I remember one, Mr Bhagwant Rai who was his boss. And he used to paint very well. So I said, “Sir, I find these paintings are so good. [UNCLEAR/born with it]”. He said, “Mrs Srivastava I wish if I could work even one-tenth of your husband, I would be very proud of myself”. Such people.

You see, and there was another one who used to bring [UNCLEAR] and then somebody told C.P. if you take a year you would be better off. He said, “[UNCLEAR], I also thought the same thing, but you better not”. I would see them always telling something that would be benevolent.

Another one also, that (in Hindi to Sir C.P.) was it Guptaji who said that? Guptaji was another boss of his. One day [UNCLEAR] said, “Why don’t you drink? Why don’t you drink? You should also become like us and join us”. He said, “I wish I could also be sober”. See, so, they could always see good, they could always put that higher, always appreciate.

Such a thing to be said about anybody is, you see, makes you understand. Also, I have seen Lal Bahadur Shastri when he was Prime Minister. He was a really trusted man, very much, all around the world.

And he was always so kind, so nice, so very sweet to Me. And his style was that – one day he came to see Me and started asking Me, “How do you run your house? What is your priority in the house?.” I said, “Sir, why are you asking Me?”. He said, “Because you run your house very well. Your husband is very good at work and all that. What will he do without you?”. So, and [UNCLEAR/my brother] and he said, “That is what is needed”. And he was saying that.

But how much he loved Mr Srivastava also is so remarkable. That one day he was down with some temperature or something. And Shastriji was going somewhere and lots of cars were with him. Suddenly he turned his own car, leaving everybody behind. You see, they had a big procession. And just came to our house. And all the police started finding – where has he gone, where has he disappeared, where has he gone? He just came alone. He said, “Mr Srivastava, apki tabiyat theek nahin, main milne chala aaya” (Mr Srivastava, you are not feeling well, I came to meet you).

Such appreciation and understanding he had. But this is a sign of goodness. That is how you can become very great. Because you have people who will work for you, who will go all out to feel that they are up to their satisfaction.

This is what we lack. I think we do not understand. It is very practical. Very practical. That those who are with you, who are working very hard, they should be all supported and helped. And they should be always understood. And this should be a practical thing. Our country will improve on this basis only. Now supposing there is a gentleman, who is working very hard, who is doing very well. Just praise him. Say he is doing well. Then somebody else is a doctor who is doing very well, say that he is doing so well.

Instead of that we try pulling everyone’s leg and flinging mud at everyone without understanding. Even in the [UNCLEAR]. Why, I have seen it. Of course, I will say, journalism in [UNCLEAR], is of course, not so good. But if it comes to praising somebody, then they go all out. And they really impress people with the qualities of hardworking, honest, sincere, intelligent, brilliant personalities, that others try to do it.

And this is what we have to try also in Sahaja Yoga. I do not know if we do it. And of course, Sahaja Yoga doors are open to everyone. Everybody can come, everybody can take a [UNCLEAR]. And I am [UNCLEAR] to my family’s support. That they have always allowed, always allowed Me to go all out to do this great work. And also not only that, they have borne a lot of nuisance in the house, in the family. Everybody comes into the house. People come in My room, they can all come just inside the bedrooms and anywhere. And without [UNCLEAR/saying], “Mother [UNCLEAR/ we are here for so and so]”. But otherwise, if anybody else does that, Mr Srivastava will correct, but not a Sahaja Yogi.

And he will always say they are angels, Sahaja Yogis are angels. And he is always very kind to them, very nice to them. And he believes that if there are Sahaja Yogis, one day this world will be great. And of course, I have seen that. As we have created the United Nations, people have to become Sahaja Yogis so that they really unite. So this is a very [UNCLEAR] that way.

And that too now, we are accepted by the United Nations. We are accepted by [UNCLEAR] as a religion and they have given us the highest position at the church. They call it an innate, a pure innate religion. And they have given us the highest [UNCLEAR]. In Russia, we are officially accepted. When I go there, [UNCLEAR/they are all there, at the plane] like a Prime Minister is visiting.

So they have accepted officially, and everything is paid by official rate [UNCLEAR]. They look after Me just like, as if some great Prime Minister of some country has come. Very surprised how these people have accepted Sahaja Yoga so well. And at all levels. Educational level, [UNCLEAR] level, political level, governments, everywhere. They take My [UNCLEAR]. And it is very surprising, really.

And I hope people should take to their spirituality and do some justice to what the great saints have done for them. And I am sure Maharashtra will have to do its bit to do that work.

May God Bless You.

[Applause].

Sahaja Yogi: And to all the great men of this era, thank you very much. And Sir C.P. we really forward to your coming to India and the great role that you are going to play in the near future in the country and turning the future of this country. We again look forward to your early coming to India.

And now, I request Shri Rajesh Shah to offer a small token of our appreciation to Sir C.P.

[Applause].

[Sir C.P. opens the gift a commemorative silver plate].

Sahaja Yogi: I would request Jose Antonio to offer a small gift for Shri Mataji.

[Jose Antonio offers the gift].

Shri Mataji: For Me? For Me?

[Applause and end of recording].
