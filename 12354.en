Evening Program during Birthday Puja

[Starts at 58:58 after the sitar. Applause]

Sahaja Yogi: Thank you very much.

Shri Mataji: [Inaudible] You must take full advantage of that. Really great, so beautiful!

Sati, Indian music is a very good routine [unsure] to master the ?

Musician: Give us time and we’ll master it.

Shri Mataji: No, you are masters, you are now master, definitely. You are Ustads [high master, Muslim word] here, you are definitely Ustads.

Did you have many recitals in India?

Musician: No, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You should come. You should come, we’ll organize for you now, this time. You all should come there. You are really masters. Why not in Australia? It’s such a great place, it’s Punya Bhoomi, a great place. I’ve not heard anyone else playing like you, who are outsiders. ?? with Ravi Shankar just couldn’t do any justice to it though it was like a little boy playing. I mean you are so good. He’s so good, it’s remarkable.

Musician: What to say? [Laughter]

I’m very thankful really, it’s great. It’s a very difficult raga. Now you should give up that abode of yours and come down. We’ll have so many ?? unless and until you teach, you see,

Sahaja Yogi: He does teach Mother, he comes down to Sydney and teaches.

Shri Mataji: Is he?

Musician: Sometimes.

Shri Mataji: Once?

Musician: Once in a while.

Shri Mataji: All right, in a while. But you are doing something else, apart from this?

Musician: Oh no, I teach also where I live.

Sahaja Yogi: He teaches in the country where he lives, up in the country.

Shri Mataji: You find better people there.

 Musician: Oh no, they are all the same, but that’s where I live you see, so.

Shri Mataji: You have some place there for them to stay also?

Musician: Yes. [Laughter] Yes there is place.

Shri Mataji: A real guru must have, isn’t it? As he has that ??

Musician: Yes. It’s like that.

Shri Mataji: Like that. That was a terrible place [Big laughter] Lots of snakes in Mayor, lots of snakes, terrible.

Sahaja Yogi: I suggest now that perhaps diner should be ready quite soon and they could join us for dinner.

Shri Mataji: Of course, they should. You see you don’t know how an artist must eat. I should have been sitting on the ground listening to them. Really, that’s how they should be respected. Artists are very much respected in India and that’s why, you see, even if in the beginning they are getting short of money and things, that will come.

Also he used to play “Megha malan” beautiful one “Megha”, “Megha raga” variations little from here to Malaray[unsure]. That was his specialities.

Sahaja Yogi: I wouldn’t dare today it might flood.

Shri Mataji: What?

Sahaja Yogi: I wouldn’t dare today it might create floods. [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: You’ve already played I think. [Laughter] Because it’s raining.

So the raga was played Miyan Ki, Miyan Ki means tenses you see, tense, and he made this raga and they said that when he used to sing this song, the rain used to fall down, you see, that’s why he’s called that. But actually, it is the raga which sings the mood of the rainy season.

Sahaja Yogi: Hello rainy season.

[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Khayal is suitable for Path gurus. This is a month of Khayal because Path gurus

This is the month of Holi and Khayal is played. Holi, you see, Holi also. That is very much, this is the mood. 

We have great Holi singers like ?? Kaza. You might not have seen him.

Sahaja Yogi: I’ve heard him.

Shri Mataji: Did you see?

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, no.

Shri Mataji: He’s great. He’s a great Holi player.

You saw that lady who came to our program? You saw that lady?

Musician: Oh yes.

Shri Mataji: She is the daughter of a very great genius. Her name was Siddeshwari [died in 1977]. Siddeshwari Devi from Banaras. Her daughter now is a professor in university and she also came and sang to Me. Savita Devi, she’s called. She was married first to Biju Marash [unsure] another, you must have heard his name Biju Marash, but now she is divorced and she is teaching there. She came to sing in our program.

Sahaja Yogi: Dinner we’ll have in a few minutes. And first Rutha and Vira. Ruth is a flutist and Vira her daughter is a violinist. They’d like to perform a piece for You as well Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: All right, they must ask the forgiveness of the later artist, you see. Always it is done that first the smaller artist play and then the greater artist. [Laughter]

All right, very good we are Sahaja Yogis and we would like to hear.

Really remarkable [inaudible] so it’s not easy to learn at that age.

All right, let’s hear you.

Girl: It’s a minuet by Mozart.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s a minuet by Mozart.

Shri Mataji: Oh God! Really? Please make yourself comfortable

[The girl plays]

Shri Mataji: Such a sense! Tremendous for her age.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, we will you your dinner now?

Shri Mataji: Yes, just, we’ll first give them Realization, it would be better?

[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: It’s easier than dinner. Let’s them have the book. I’m just coming out.

[Shri Mataji goes to the sitting room.]

May God bless you.

Please be sited.

Now, let’s see this gentleman.

Now, can you remove that table?

Just you have to put your hands like this, all of you. Just like this (palms towards the sky)

Close your eyes, that’s all.

You’ll start feeling a cool breeze in hands. As you have played before Me maybe you are already feeling it.

[Shri Mataji makes a bandhan]

See on the head. 

Shri Mataji: Hum. You have all got it.

[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: Can you feel the cool breeze

Shri Mataji: The cool breeze in the hands.

Sahaja Yogi: Do you feel a cool breeze on your hands, is it flowing onto your hands.

[Shri Mataji makes a bandhan]

Musician: [Inaudible]

Sahaja Yogi: Just keep your attention here, don’t think about it.

Shri Mataji: Just put your hand up and you can see, from your head the air-conditioner is coming.

Sahaja Yogi: As if it’s flowing upwards.

Musician: Of, yes.

Shri Mataji: It’s there.

Sahaja Yogi: That’s the Kundalini

Shri Mataji: All right? That’s the Kundalini. That’s the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

Are you feeling relaxed? This lady also has got it. That’s the reward for beautiful playing.

[Laughter]

What else can I give you? A little liver he has got. Come here just a minute.

[To the Yogi] Can you get some ?? from there and just come.

You think too much, do you? Just face Me.

Musician: Face you?

Shri Mataji: Yes, face Me. Close your eyes.
