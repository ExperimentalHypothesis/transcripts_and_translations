To My Flower Children

You are angry with life
Like small children
Whose mother is lost in darkness
You sulk expressing despair
At the fruitless end to your journey
You wear ugliness to discover beauty
You name everything false in the name of truth
You drain emotions to fill the cup of love
My sweet children, my darlings
How can you get peace by waging war
With yourself, with your being, with joy itself
Enough are your efforts of renunciation
The artificial mask of consolation.

Now rest in the petals of the lotus flower
In the lap of your gracious mother
I will adorn your life with beautiful blossoms
And fill your moments with joyful fragrance
I will anoint your head with divine love
For I cannot bear your torture anymore
Let me engulf you in the ocean of joy
So you lose your being in the greater one
Who is smiling in your calyx of Self
Secretly hidden to tease you all the while
Be aware and you will find him
Vibrating your every fibre with blissful joy
Covering the whole Universe with light.
