To My Flower Children

You are angry with lifeLike small childrenWhose mother is lost in darknessYou sulk expressing despairAt the fruitless end to your journeyYou wear ugliness to discover beautyYou name everything false in the name of truthYou drain emotions to fill the cup of loveMy sweet children, my darlingsHow can you get peace by waging warWith yourself, with your being, with joy itselfEnough are your efforts of renunciationThe artificial mask of consolation.

Now rest in the petals of the lotus flowerIn the lap of your gracious motherI will adorn your life with beautiful blossomsAnd fill your moments with joyful fragranceI will anoint your head with divine loveFor I cannot bear your torture anymoreLet me engulf you in the ocean of joySo you lose your being in the greater oneWho is smiling in your calyx of SelfSecretly hidden to tease you all the whileBe aware and you will find himVibrating your every fibre with blissful joyCovering the whole Universe with light.
