“The sea must be worshipped,” Shri Mataji On the beach at Ganapatipule, 30 December 1985

(Discussion about marriages being arranged )

Gregoire: She’s accepted. I think he’s a little shorter than what she thought.

Shri Mataji: But she has three children what is she accepting?!!

Gregoire: Yes. (laughter)

Shri Mataji: I just don’t understand with three children [still] this, that nonsense! They should all go to U.P.! Marry the husbands and go back [to U.P. (Uttar Pradesh)].

Rustom: Should get some from Lucknow Shri Mataji:

Shri Mataji: Lucknow!

(Hindi)

Rustom: You get good televisions in India.

Shri Mataji: I know but I had to bring it with me but these people they put powder in it, dust in it, to make it look old. And why try such a thing? I don’t understand. There’s one fellow called Marlow who’s so negative.

The custom officer who did this he didn’t give me a ??. That’s a fact, you know. I mean, I have no time to think of such things. While this is English mind. I have to tell them. They cannot think straight.

Rustom: They cannot be sincere, you know.

Shri Mataji: They are not sincere people. They have no heart. But specially that fellow who has done it, he’s a very crooked fellow and he has been taking drugs and this and that.

Yogi (Venugopalan?): Can I read now?

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. Read it.

(yogi reads out a compendium of some of Mother’s quotes about dedication)

Shri Mataji: He’s a real income tax man!! (Laughter) Come to tax my income you see!

Yogi: How to keep Mother pleased...

Shri Mataji: That’s me, so that I know! 

(Yogi finishes reading the quotes of Mother)

Shri Mataji: Beautiful!

Yogi: I think it has come out well Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Very well! It just shows how subtly you are an income tax fellow! Really you’ve done very well, very well. But actually what I feel [is] that when, out of context people read it, you see, it might look little bit too much.

Yogi: But when it’s read by Sahaja Yogis...

Shri Mataji: Yes, then it’s alright. For Sahaja Yogis will be happy to do that.

Yogi: Very happy, in one place their essence is there, on many topics.

Shri Mataji: But for others, you see, they might get a shock, because when I speak, I always cover it with some chocolates so the castor oil goes in straight forward. But Sahaj Yogis they love to have castor oil, direct. It’s alright, as long as it doesn’t go into the hands of others it’s perfectly alright.

(Shri Mataji goes to the sea to footsoak and walk on the beach)

Yogi: Shri Mataji please tell us something for our record. 

Shri Mataji: Our what?

Yogi: For our record here. You've come on the beach the first time during this trip.

Shri Mataji: The sea is the Father, He’s the Guru, and he must be worshipped. Before you do any puja, Guru must to be worshipped. First the Shri Ganesha and then the Guru has to be worshipped. That’s why I came to the sea, so you all learnt that you all have to worship the sea and not to spoil things like this (pointing to some rubbish on the beach). See now! That’s not a good idea. You should never spoil a sea shore. That’s your Father’s, it should not be spoiled. And also to wear funny dresses and misbehave in the presence of your Guru is inauspicious. One should not do like that. But I don’t know how many understand the importance of the sea.

If you behave like this goes angry then you have lots of problems. Like it may never be a sunny day for you to come to the sea. Or maybe on every holiday it will be a clouded day. Or maybe that the tankers might break and it will have all oil over, if you spoil the beach. If you spoil the beach you might invite the typhoons and you might have all the problems. Or on the sea beach if you develop things like tobacco and all those harmful things like alcohol, then the typhoon will come and  break that. 

So one should be very careful. If you are on the sea shore you have advantages, but the greatest disadvantage is that Guru is very powerful and extremely holy and auspicious, is absolutely auspicious. So one has to be careful on that.

Those who have eaten here or done these things are very wrong. They don’t understand what the sea means. 

So may God bless you!

May God bless you!
