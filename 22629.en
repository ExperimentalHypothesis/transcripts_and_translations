Sahaja Yogi: John Noyce.
[Cut in the video]

Rustom: You get good televisions in India. Thank you.
Shri Mataji: I know but he’s critic about what we do.
I had to bring him with me, because these people, you see, I don't know they put already made
dust in it, to make it [inaudible]. Why try such a trick? I don’t understand.

This fellow, there’s one fellow who’s called Marlow. He’s so negative!
The person who was there. He said, "[inaudible] I can get "

Sahaja Yogi: You can say it in English, Shri Mataji. It’s your birth right ... It is like a country.

Shri Mataji: The custom officer who did this [?] She didn't get Me a visa. That’s a fact, I mean, I have no time to think of such things. While this is English mind.
Sahaja Yogi: Never go straight.
Shri Mataji: I would say that they have loose angle
[inaudible] I have to tell them.
They cannot think straight.
You got it? [Hindi conversation]

Rustom: They cannot be sincere.
Shri Mataji: They are not sincere people. They have no heart. But especially that fellow who has done it, he’s a very crooked fellow and he has been taking drugs, this, that.

Sahaja Yogini: ... Study.
Shri Mataji: Ah, very good!
Mr Venugopalan: Can I read now?
Shri Mataji: No, later.

Mr Venugopalan: I can read.
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. Read it.

Mr Venugopalan: [Most of it comes from the talk 30/07/1982]
“You have to Dedicate yourself completely to me, not to Sahaja Yoga, but to me. Sahaja Yoga is just one of my aspects. Leaving everything, you have to dedicate. Complete dedication, otherwise you cannot ascend any further. Without questioning, without arguing. [Most of it comes from the talk 30/07/1982]

Dedication is the easiest way to get rid of all your angularities, all your problems, all your badhas.
Complete dedication, is the only way you can grow further.

Krishna said, ‘Sarva dharmanam parityajya, mamekam sharanam vraja’. Forget all the religion of the world (dharma).
There is no difference between him and me, but today I am the one, I am the one who has given you Realization.

All these dharmas are to be given up entirely, and you have to surrender fully from your heart.

Here, as you are before me today, I want to tell you very frankly, as Krishna had told only Arjuna, ‘Sarva dharmanam parityajya, mamekam sharanam vraja’.

Shri Krishna has said: “Give up all your dharmas and surrender them to Me, surrender to my dharma only”. “You should only know what you owe to Me” meaning the Divinity. Now Shri Krishna is not there, it’s Me who is Shri Krishna, so you must know what you owe to Me. [Krishna puja, 1983, Vienne]

She can be achieved through bhakti. She can only be achieved through dedication. She’s only fond of her bhaktas, the devotees.
For this, meditation is the only way I should say.
Emotionally you may feel closer to Me in your heart. 

But through meditation, surrender. Meditation is nothing but surrendering, is complete surrendering.
In your full freedom, complete freedom, you have to surrender.
And only through your bhakti, through your devotion and dedication, you can achieve Me. My achievement is the complete manifestation of your Divine power. It’s very simple, made so simple. I’m only pleased by people who are simple, innocent, who are not tricky, who are loving, affectionate to each other. It’s very easy to please Me. When I see you loving each other, talking good of each other, helping each other, respecting each other, laughing aloud together, enjoying together each other’s company, I get my first blessing, my first joy.
So, the dedication in meditation, complete dedication in meditation, must be practiced. It’s not for your good now you are doing it, so-called ‘your’.
First you were a little baby, a small thing; now you are that collective being, so you are not doing anything for yourself, but for that collective being. You are growing to be aware of that whole which you are going to become. Your jobs, your money, your wives, your husbands, your children, your father, mother, relations, these considerations are over now. You all have to take up the responsibility of Sahaja Yoga. Every one of you is quite capable. You are brought up for that.

In dedication, in complete devotion, you have to do it now, not for your own gain, for your own achievement, that’s over now. It’s for completely getting out of the mire and standing on the land, singing aloud the praise of your Father.

You have to bear the brunt, and the sacrifice, which are no more sacrifices to you because Spirit gives, it never sacrifices. Its quality is to give. So, you don’t sacrifice, you just give.

Sahaja Yogi: Today, one more lecture Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. It's coming out well.

Sahaja Yogi: Our greatest possession.
The greatest possession you have is your Mother. Through her you have your brothers and sisters.
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful. You know that is the most powerful name than all other names, the most powerful name. But you must know how to take it. With that complete dedication you have to take that name.

I have taken birth in this world in the binding of Sahaja Yogis and have been moving around only in their binding. I am desireless and hence my everything depends upon your desires. [Letter to SY, 1978]

Attain Me; I am yours! I am for you. I have given you that which has been beyond the reach of very great sages and saints. [Letter, Marathi, 1983]

When I’m speaking it is a mantra, when I’m not speaking, is a mantra flowing. [Krishna puja, 1983, Vienne]

Those who are fanatically adhering to Me are also not correct. There should be no fanaticism about it.

But the ideal one important thing

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]
He’s a real income tax man! [Laughter] Come to tax my income you see!
Mr Venugopalan: I have read it to show who is the true ideal.
That a Sahaja Yogi is happy in the circumstances that are prevailing. If he is not, then his satisfaction is superficial and not from within. A river starts with a very small little drop, and then it expands, expands, expands, expands.
When you ‘become’ the parents and ‘then’ you enjoy other children as much as you enjoy your child, then your generosity has started. [Easter, 22/04/1984]

You have to be a peaceful person, not an aggressive person. The person who is peaceful is powerful- the one who doesn’t react to anything else, is the most powerful. You have to be kind to others. You have to be neat and clean.
First is forgiveness, second the detachment leading to compassion. These are the wheels of your chariot which moves you. You have been made like temples. Keep it clear.
We are moving towards the soothing qualities of the Spirit. You have to ‘soothe’ the others and not to excite, but to soothe.
Let God’s melodies be sounded from your flutes.
You must have the capacity to deepen your meditative power, so that these ideals go and settle in your heart, as a part and parcel of your being. (Diwali 1983)
Once the saints know this is the principle on which we have to live, they become one with the principles.
[??] these are principles on which we have to live.
You become the mother, and you, whatever you are which has to grow, is the child. If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to be a flower, and a strong flower, and an eternal flower that always grows, does not fade out, always growing, never fades, such a flower you have to be.

Sahaja Yogi should never be angry.

If somebody has to tell you that you must organize go fast and hold back and do not feel bad.
We have to do so much work in this world. We have no time to waste.
Truly keep the maryadas in Sahaja Yoga same morning and evening that, "I am a Sahaja Yogi", nobody can harm you, hurt you, nobody can trouble you. On the contrary, you will be enjoying life if you keep to the maryadas.
One must promise to God that, "We’ll know about Sahaja Yoga through proper understanding reading every word of it. We’ll master the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga."
We will keep ourselves clean and completely surrender ourselves, our lives to Sahaja Yoga."

Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy, bliss and peace.
Language should be sweet.
Your behaviour should be good.
You should be very gentle and soft; you should move like a Yogi, live like a saint. And people should see through you the greatness of Sahaja Yoga.
See the trees when they get their flowers, they are not so respectful. But when they are laden by the fruits, they bow down to Mother Earth. In the same way when you have got the fruits of Sahaja Yoga, you all must bow down. (Navaratri 1984, first day)
You have to be sensitive to God and not to bad things. 

You have to change your methods. The person who cannot change his methods cannot spread Sahaja Yoga. Because he sticks to only one way with which people get bored. You should find new ways. [Rahuri, 31/12/1980]

An established Sahaja Yogi is the one who becomes completely one with God and wins him over. He has to do everything for that. This is how is a true Sahaja Yogi.
[Hindi conversation]

Mr Venugopalan: How to keep Mother pleased
Shri Mataji: That’s me, so that I know!

Mr Venugopalan: So, how to please Mother?
“I am also a simple person so I want a simple-hearted person.
So, this Heart Chakra is to be first looked after. That with your heart — desire that you’ll keep your Mother pleased.
If the heart is not clear, then everything has no meaning because it is a “dark heart” which is doing all these things. The heart has to be clean, absolutely surrendered and must try to put Me before everything else.
Lakshmi tattva has to become Mahalakshmi tattva. That is for your ascent. And just to get it to that Mahalakshmi tattva what you have to do is to use all your material things and your material being in such a way that you please me.
[Devi puja, January1983]
Shri Mataji: Bapre, give me horrible things, all right.
Mr Venugopalan: You have to keep your Mother pleased by pleasing other Sahaja Yogis and not other people.
What guru dakshinat have you given me?
Understand that your money is not worth the dust on the feet of your Mother Guru! You should give your hearts – only clean and holy hearts. You must clean your physical beings. You must get up early in the morning and spend at least one hour on meditation and worshipping. Perform "Aarti" and meditation in the evening. [Letter, Marathi, 1983]

I'll read about laws of the Divine.
One must know the laws of the Divine, that you have to live with self-respect, that we have to be chaste, that we have to have dignity, that we cannot steal money and steal things and be parasites. That we cannot kill others and we cannot beat others and say harsh things, they are just the same. And that we have respect, the respect for all that is sublime. Respect for all the saints that are Sahaja Yogis. With all this, we are very different people. We are different race. We are virtuous, we are righteous and we are proud to be that way. We are sure of everything. And we are personification of Compassion, of Love of God. That’s what we are. We are not ordinary people.
On the subtler side is compassion is forgiveness, is love. But the greatest of all is service to God. We are doing the work of God. How can we be tired? The dynamic is flowing through us, that compassion is so fulfilling, that love is so beautifying that how can we not do it? God has created this universe, this world and you people out of this Compassion only, just His compassion. [Navaratri, Meudon, 1984]

Shri Mataji: Beautiful!
Mr Venugopalan: I think it’s come out well Mother.
Shri Mataji: Very well!
It just shows how subtly you are an income tax fellow! [Laughter]
Really, you’ve done very well, very well. But actually, what I feel, that when, out of context people read it, you see, it might look little bit too much.
Sahaja Yogi: But I will read it only to Sahaja Yogis.
Shri Mataji: Yes, then it’s all right.
Sahaja Yogis, they’ll be happy to hear that.
Sahaja Yogi: Very happy, in one place the essence is there, on many topics.
Shri Mataji: But for others, you see, they might get a shock, because when I speak, I always cover it with some chocolates, you see. So, the Castrol [lubricant] is going in straight forward. But Sahaja Yogis they love to have Castrol, direct. It’s all right, as long as it doesn’t go into the hands of others it’s perfectly all right.

"With Shri Mataji on the beach"
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, please, tell us something for our record.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: Please, tell us something for our record, here.
Shri Mataji: For what?

Sahaja Yogi: For our record.
So, you’ve come on the beach for the first time during this trip.
Shri Mataji: Yes. You see the sea is the Father, is the Guru, and he must be worshipped before you do any puja, Guru must to be worshipped.
First the Shri Ganesha and then the Guru has to be worshipped.
That’s why I came to the sea, so you all learnt that you all have to worship the sea and not to spoil things like this.
See now: That’s not a good idea. You should never spoil a sea shore.
That’s your Father’s altar, it should not be spoiled.
And also, to wear funny dresses and misbehave in the presence of your Guru is inauspicious.
One should not do like that. But I don’t know how many understand the importance of the sea.
If you behave like this the sea goes angry then you have lots of problems. Like, it may never be a sunny day for you to come to the sea.
Or maybe on every holiday it will be a clouded day.
Or maybe that the tankers might break and it will have oil all over, if you spoil the beach.
If you spoil the beach you might invite the typhoons and you might have all the problems.
Or on the sea beach if you develop things like tobacco and all those harmful things like alcohol, then the typhoon will come and break that.
So, one should be very careful.
If you are on the sea shore you have advantages, but the greatest disadvantage is that Guru is very powerful and extremely holy and auspicious, absolutely auspicious.
So, one has to be careful on that.
Those who have weakening [unsure] here or done these things are very wrong.
They don’t understand what the sea means.
May God bless you!
Sahaja Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

Shri Mataji: A real heart.
Real heart, I tell you. Someone should take a photograph.
Sahaja Yogi: This chair.
Shri Mataji: A real heart. Get a photograph.
Sahaja Yogi: Hold on the thing, shadow on the lands and you take it straight up.
Shri Mataji: Exactly a heart.
Sahaja Yogi: "Tike"? Swing it from the side.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Swing it from here and take it up.
Sahaja Yogi: It gets spoiled, "ne"?

Cameraman: Shortly before the Gauri puja.
Then Shri Mataji goes to the temple and Shri Ganesha [inaudible].
 It's very good.
Just wanted to get your hands.
