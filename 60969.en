Gregoire: Shri Mataji, can we just make a comment. In the Devi Mahatmya, the demons which the Goddess had to destroy, when they heard about this beautiful Woman, it was the deity of the Himalya – they, She had to come to us because we, that is the rakshasas, we the demons, we are the enjoyers of the best objects. And still today, in this world, if you look at all the evil people, they are the enjoyers of the best objects. They have the best places, they bought the most beautiful spots of the world, the most expensive things.
So, it’s a Swiss who is speaking, you know.
[Laughter]
Richesses are quite stuff with these people. And while we offer these humble presents to Shri Mataji, we express our own desire that it is Her above all. And all those who proceed further, who have to enjoy the best of gems, of her creation. Jai Shri Mataji.
[Applause]

Shri Mataji: Actually, there are not enjoying. Devils cannot enjoy. Because they have to get their Spirit to enjoy. They are all the time in a fear of the income tax.
[Laughter]
Of the police. They are doing all some sort of illegal things. Taking other’s money, taking illegal things. They have illegal diamonds. They are all the time worried. If they see a policeman, they start shaking. If they see Me, I don’t know what will happen.
[Laughter]
[Applause]

Now the- your idea is of giving Me presents, all right. I cannot say, "No" as it is puja. But whatever you give Me, will be just going to the person uncle [unclear]. And all these things will be kept there, for progeny to see how you liked to present your love to your Mother. That's what it is going to be. And then people will know how loving you were, how intelligently and understandingly, you selected these things for Me. All these things are always kept here. On this Mother Earth.
We don't let them get ruined [unsure]. Every time I keep my vibrations [unsure].

And that because you can see.
May God bless you.
