Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Los Angeles Ashram 1, Los Angeles (United States)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

Holy Mother talking with women that are washing her feet...inaudible...This is a nice ashram that you have, I’ve heard about it, but next time that I see you all ...inaudible...ah, I have an expert now?

Hawaii I’ve heard that it is a wonderful place for Sahaja yoga, and mostly there are pollination there, but so much vibrations, wonderful, very very blessed. It’s symptoms that there are a lot of symmetries despite there being quite a lot ...inaudible..., these people worship there and sisters...poor audio/inaudible. It's been such a long time since I've come to Los Angeles ... last time that I came, everybody was gathering, but you can’t gather everyone and then disappear.

Such a big city that it is spread out and so many, what you can say, suburbs are there. Slowly slowly you should spread out to suburbs also. Like this Melbourne has thirty meters long and twenty meters broad. So what you start doing is to send one person to one corner and one in another corner, like that, and there are no proper ashram, they had only houses, and now suddenly all of them have joined together.

Los Angeles means the angels which are lost, or something? What’s the Spanish meaning? -The angels Shri Mataji, just the angels- Los is the? -Los is the article- But this city plays a really big role in the culture of America. As in the Vishuddhi you have got Hamsa it’s like that, it’s Hamsa chakra, very important. They are extremely money oriented also.

Very pretty flowers, really (talking about the garland).

That place Hawaii has a tradition, I mean  Hawa-ai, Ai is the Mother, Hawa is the Earth, that’s according to the Marathi language. But it has a tradition, it is said that is the breath of the divine. Everything there is talking about the breath, as the air of the divine, it’s very remarkable. Most of the things there are sung traditionally, they’re so much as Sahaja yoga.

I went to see Doctor Warliker, and this is one of the examples of Sahaja miracles I should say. We were in Calcutta when Doctor Khan, who is a very well known scientist, fell on his top and fell on his back and the top broke, such a big deal, and the skull also broke, and this and that affected the brain also. So he became unconscious, they took him to the hospital, and they said he cannot be saved, he will die by tomorrow, stitched his head up, everything was done with the bones right. And then he telephoned me, and told me about the concussion of the brain, and God knows how it got it, maybe a heart attack, felt so badly, and there’s a concussion of the brain. So I gave him vibrations, I put on a bandhan. Next day again (bandhan). The next day he started throwing “I should be all right”, on the phone I said “it will work it out, don’t worry”. And next day he opened his eyes nicely and he said “I’m feeling much better”, and then they moved him from the intensive care to another ward. Then sahaja yogis went and gave him vibrations. But he never felt any pain or anything. And when I saw him, you should also see Doctor Warliker, he looks at least 10 years younger, just like that, he was also looking 10 years younger when I went there. It’s attention when the things can be worked out, no doubt. But you also should use attention like that. If your attention is cleaned it will also work, it will also act, see (why) your attention has to be all right. Australians noticed that we have a lot of sahaja yogis there, but they don’t meditate, their attention is not all right, it’s here and there, there and here. I asked them, do you meditate? No, we don’t meditate so much regularly we must be honest. So I said this is not good, you have to be honest to yourself, you must meditate morning and evening, otherwise things will never improve, they’ll never be improved, and you will be in trouble. I think now it started working very well, and starting doing all this meditation. Even in the ashram they do not have collective meditation, they do not have any individual meditation. I said what is the point of having an ashram if you cannot meditate? Everybody is very busy. I said why do you have an ashram? So this is what it is, you have to really grow and then you must meditate, is the only way you can do it. I mean, you don’t need to meditate, in sense you do something about  it, but you have to be in meditation, that’s what Sahaj Yoga is, to be in meditation, that strict you must get, you must get to the state of thoughtless awareness, and in that state only you can really come up. I was surprised that some of them were not even attending public programs, and some were not even meditating. I said what will happen? After some time they will be just like other people, there won't be any difference. And that was really surprising. And within 10 days everybody improved, I didn’t tell them. It was such a journey from Perth, I went to Sidney, it’s another world, I mean from Perth to Sidney it’s another continent, and from Sidney there were very beautiful places. And they told us of the miraculousness of it. Suddenly, they met somebody and said “why don’t you try?” a ground, a skyground, just in the center of the city, beautiful, absolutely like a jungle inside the city, so quiet, people could not hear anything that was going ...inaudible... in this beautiful place. They’ve got very beautiful cottages, but one of them was smaller and they call it Paramatha, the river’s name is Paramatha, meaning the primordial mother, so they gave the name of Paramatha and decorated it. The person who was organising all that was Australian, he was so impressed by them, he had never seen such people and when I went there he bowed to me. How could you create such beautiful things? I’ve said I haven’t created, they have done that. Just imagine how intense it was that time, how everything changed. Whatever it is you must meditate before going to sleep, it’s extremely important.

Let us see what happens in Hawaii, but I must say they have been very adventurous to go there and started the whole thing in such a good way, and I’m sure they managed very well, spoke very well also. I was amazed how good a speaker he was, explaining everything very well, and that intensity was tangible. This is a new word I know from him, tangible. Because normally this word wasn’t used before, it’s a modern word, tangible. Sahaja yoga is absolutely tangible, and they were so much interested that despite it being raining they were still sitting down. And I went there on the stage, I went inside another hall, which had this platform, suddenly they found it, and they all worked out with them, worked in with the chairs  ..inaudible.. like this, it was very nice.

So what you ..inaudible.. about vibrations because ..inaudible.. vibrations improves you will see things much better, and when your vibrations are all right Saha Yoga is going to work much faster, otherwise it is not going to work. As you know America is a very difficult place, so you have to work much harder, you have to put a lot of priority on it, you have to say that the most important thing is Sahaja Yoga, otherwise you won’t be able to achieve much. If you are just making it the second thing it wont work, you don’t have to sacrifice much, but only your ascent has to be achieved, and once it is achieved your problem will be solved, you’ll be much better on (solving them). The first time I came to (USA) I came in Los Angeles, in 1997, it was in Los Angeles.

All these people can be nicely exposed, and they will be exposed ...inaudible.. the way they talk also, people can find them ...inaudible. For example I was sawing yesterday in the night, ...inaudible...taking a note, and he was saying that if you reduce, 100 dollar note, you will get 1000. Openly, shamelessly, just talking like that. And he was even saying that a lady sent him 100 dollars, so she offered groceries, so all groceries came to her house. All these things, it’s unbelievable. How can people really digest such things, how could they bear it? Instead of saying you are all stupid bhoots, instead of everything else. And he was brainwashing everyone, potential from the Bible. You called them evangelists, isn’t it Josep? -Yes Shri Mataji- So evangelists, so they are the ones that are making money out of the Bible.

So now we have found something very genuine, when we have got something so exceptionally unique, which no one knew about, it is our responsibility now, that we have to give it to others in every possible way. I mean, if you cannot do that, if you do not do it, then, I don’t know what to say because that shows that you did not react properly to the timing in which you are born, or at what purpose you are born at this time. Very important to understand, you are born at this time to do something so exceptional, this timing is right there, but we have other activities we are indulging into, other things which are our priorities, they all can be completely achieved if you just meditate yourselves. So I think I will leave you tonight, last time I think we slept at 3-4-5-6 o’ clock, I was traveling. God bless you.

-Shri Mataji, I think- Do you want to do it? all right (speaking with a Sahaja yogi). Not the complete, is it the vibrations, is it too much for me. Long to see? All right. Good. Who are the vibrations like that? I have decided to have Ganesha puja here, international Ganesha puja will be here next year.
