Talk at Marriages. Hampstead, London (UK), 25 June 1981.

If you feel that you can get happiness from your wife it is an absolutely wrong idea. You can never get happiness from anybody else but from yourself. The joy comes from your spirit not from anybody else. 


Now supposing a Sahaja yogi has married a person who is not a Sahaja yogi. It's a wonderful study, you can study a person so close who is not a Sahaja Yogi - how he is prankish, how he goes into tantrums and how he behaves. You get a regular idea of see a sort of role being played by someone, you start seeing the whole drama much better. 


Supposing he is a Sahaja yogi maybe, (although this is a little different because there won't be any problem or quarrel) you can see the person how he behaves, then you understand, you understand why you behave like that and what we have to do, what are the problems and how to make the arrangements by which these people stop going into these holes and getting stuck up into it. You start studying and when you start studying like that and not getting angry or impatient with the person who is your partner then you'll start enjoying. 


But if you start getting impatient and in the beginning Sahaja Yogis do feel impatient with their partners because they are not Sahaja Yogis. They think that these people are lost now, what should they do, will they be able to get their realization and all that. Instead of that, if you really develop properly, if you grow properly, you start seeing it in a different angle, you say: "Oh, that's the way they are". You then start generalizing all this, then you do not say this is my wife, she should have that, this is my wife. 


Some people think that because somebody is your wife, she should be a perfect personality because she's your wife and - what are you? Are you perfect? Why do you expect your wife to be that perfect. If she has kept one thing here or there or he - it can be either way - I mean he or she, it does not matter, whosoever has done so called mistakes. Actually it comes because you think you are absolutely perfect, on top of the world, you see, and that's why you try to find faults with another person. 


When we are a Sahaja yogi you realize that you have to grow, you have to mature and how can you find faults with people like that, only thing you can do is to study the whole thing because the whole thing becomes a drama, only a big drama. 


You start seeing the whole thing as a drama and it doesn't behave the way you want things to behave. As if these circumstances sometimes engulf you and you can become frantic. I think here people, you see, because the husband came late so the wife hit the husband or beat him or something like that. You see how funny. She was angry because he came late or whatever he did, was because he did not love her. She felt that it was true that he should love and to love should you kill the husband? Then who is going to love you? This kind of thing, you see, starts being very, I should say, paradoxical behavior. They are so paradoxical and the whole thing becomes so apparent and so vivid when you start seeing it through your spirit, because you're not in it, you are yourself. You are not now the husband or wife or anything, but you see yourself as a husband, another person for the wife, or you see yourself as a wife, another person for the husband. It's a very different thing and then the whole thing becomes such a drama and such a beautiful poetry that you start seeing and feel that the whole Shakespeare is coming before you or a most dramatic thing is happening to you.
