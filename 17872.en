I bow to all the seekers of truth.

You are here to feel the truth. And not to just conceptualize it mentally.

Now, there's a question yesterday, people asked that what is the difference between Sahaja Yoga and other Yogas. All these yogas have been written down by a saint called Patanjali, long time back. And he called it Ashtanga Yoga, with eight facets. He existed a thousand years back and that time we have a system in which the students went into the university to study under some enlightened soul, a guru, sadhguru. So, there are eight facets of the yoga, mean union with the divine. So, he has got, the first one is yama, yamah, yama is the first one in which he has written what we have to do to make our breathing alright or to control our misbehaviour. So, one-third of that is the asanas where you do physical exercises for a particular type of problem. But that is not Hatha Yoga. Hatha Yoga is complete Patanjali Yoga Shastra, that is complete Pantajali Yoga scripture. Asanas or these practices of physical exercises is a very wee bit, is one one-twenty fourth of one of them. 'Ha' and 'Tha', Ha means the sun and Tha means the moon. So both are considered in Hatha Yoga. Because we are not only physical beings. We are a physical being, we are mental being, we are emotional being, we are a spiritual being. So only to keep your physical being is not so important. One has to understand that all these things were done by a realized soul who knew what asanas are to be used, what physical exercises are to be used for a particular person. But some of the people who went to the gurus in the Himalayas, and they were very greedy people and not good for any kind of yoga. So, the gurus told them you better do physical exercises, just to get rid of them. So they came down and started teaching all these acrobats. But such a craze now that people don't know what are the side effects of this kind of imbalanced behaviour. The right side if used too much, the left side is completely neglected. So such people become very dry by nature, there is no love, no compassion. They become very hot-tempered and they try to get angry at the slightest pretext. Sometimes are so hot-tempered you have to go with a barge pole in between. They become horrid fathers or mothers, and always fight with each other and mostly end up with divorces. And the women who do too much of this Hatha Yoga cannot even produce children. They become so dominating that it is difficult to make out whether they are a man or a woman or a tiger. So...but in the Patanjali Yoga Shastras, it is described that those physicals exercises required for physical correction of your spinal cord. So, when the kundalini rises you see the problem on what centre it is and you try to...try to improve that particular chakra. For example, if your this centre is catching, agnya, then you have to say 'I forgive everyone', otherwise it won't open at any cost. So, unless and until the Kundalini moves, how will you know what's the blockade. And then, how will you know what Asana is to be done or not to be done. So, it is like taking all the medicines from the medicine box thinking you are very sick. So, it is so indiscriminate.

Now, the second one is Raja Yoga where it is said that you have to...ah...that you have to know that when the kundalini rises there are certain places like valves on the centres. They stop the kundalini from falling down. Now, when the kundalini rises like the car starts gets ignited, all the machinery starts working automatically. Also, the tongue is a little bit pulled inside which you don't feel, but it is pulled inside a little bit. Because the kundalini should not fall down from this centre [pointing to throat chakra]. But today's horrible the Raja Yoga is that they cut the thread of the tongue and the tongue wags like a dogs tongue, you can't talk, you can't eat. This is to put the tongue back. For what are you putting, there is no kundalini what are you stopping there? That automatic action is called as Kechari and these people are artificially doing it. I have seen many people in Los Angeles, old people whom I knew also, having that kind of a tongue [hanging out]. So they teach, they teach you to hold your stomach, to hold here [chest]

, ahh..but there is no Kundalini what are you holding? When the car has not started what is the use of putting the choke or taking out a wheel and moving it. It is so artificial. Then somebody has asked me, this is they call as Akriya, uh...Kriya yoga but Sahaja Yoga is Akriya, Akriya means action, what action can you do to raise the Kundalini. If you have to sprout the seed, what action do you take? You just put the see in the mother earth. Finished. Now you open the seed, take out the primule and push it back do you think...[laughs] do you think it will sprout? This is how so many beautiful seekers are harmed. There are so many like that. Funny funny things. Like they just talk talk talk talk talk, big lectures, big big books, talking of big big things. Because you people have not heard of these words, they go on writing all kinds of nonsense and you have to digest it. There are all types of people telling you to take the name of somebody, go on chanting something. Or they say that you read this book, read that book. How many books did Christ read? [laughs]

Think of it, this kind of stupidity they are spreading all over. And you have to use your brains. The other day I met a person who made a little book of Gita in gold and then put it here [neck]. And he said his guru is selling this and that now he is in the heavens, just imaginary. But it is said about all this falsehood, has been written down by so many saints. Guru Nanaka has said the one who meets you God is the only Sadhguru, is the only guru. So, all these funny ideas that are written down or have been told to you or given lectures. Are all to be understood in one way that what have you got out of it. Like somebody said he has got a diamond. But diamond you can get in the market. Alright, and he himself is a heart patient. And he came to me for curing himself. So, I told him, first of all, give up this diamond to some poor man then come to me. Then there are other types also, who mesmerise you. But they have no knowledge, nothing. Just they get mesmerized and they said we have had an experience. But they have no knowledge as to what has happened, what is within you, how to work it out, nothing. Only what ah they feel, ah, that oh something has happened to us. Also, don't know what has happened to them. So with this kind of your understanding, you are definitely going to get lost. You have to know that anybody who takes money from you, for giving you realization, or anything, is a false person. Is alright they can pay for the hall, or they can pay for the aeroplane, but you cannot pay for self-realization. Then third thing you must see what is happening to the disciples. Now disciples have become like mad people. Some are in the lunatic asylum, some are begging, some are uh aggressive violent people. Such people, how can they be spiritual. There is no knowledge, no love, no compassion. So, what's the use of wasting your energy with something so nonsensical because you have never known it before. Anything new should not be accepted blindfolded. But we should, first of all, understand it in our full awareness and then we should accept. Of course, mesmerism is very easy because you can mesmerise thousands of people. But to create really knowledgeable, dynamic,

compassionate, effective and powerful people is very difficult. After Sahaja Yoga, you will see you will become extremely powerful. And you know what power you have. And you know this is the power of love. You all the time feel the bliss of God. And every time you can find out if it is truth or not. So when you get your realization, then first you feel the cool breeze of the holy ghost for the first time and on your fingertips, you can feel the centres that are yours. And the centres of others. Also, you know how to use it. You can see here there are some English, there are some Italians uh from all over the world, people are singing Sanskrit songs. Sanksrit is the most difficult language, worse than even Latin. And even to speak Hindi by these people is a difficult thing. And the speed with which they sing, even an Indian can't do it. Even the Swiss are doing that, Swiss! Who were so...[laughs] and the English! Which is a miracle! [laughs]

And you can't make them out who is English and who is a German. We have many Jews who worship Christ. And we have many Muslims who worship Rama.

The other day I saw one Irani and Iraqi just hugging each other and being very friendly. Iraqi and Irani. What a brotherhood they enjoy. Because they have become collectively conscious. All this is described in Patanjali. First, he says â€“ uh - is here [forehead] is thoughtless awareness which he calls in Sanskrit Nirvichara Samadhi. And then here is calls it [top of the head] as doubtless awareness, which we call as Nirvikalpa Samadhi. And these all-pervading power he calls as rutambara pragnya. See that's Italian [laughs]. So, it's a, it's a force within you, it's a force already within you, it's your own. And is your own individual mother, this kundalini is. And you can feel it with a stethoscope. In some people when it moves slowly, till it reaches here on top of your head, you can feel the throbbing, till it breaks. And then you feel the cool breeze from your own head coming out. You feel very relaxed and peaceful. You feel the cool breeze all on your fingertips. Within a month's time, you become a master. You can give realization to others. You can cure others. And you become a very dynamic peaceful personality. Your face starts glowing. Your age drops ten years at least. There's a glint in your eye. And you are a saint! You become a very sane innocent person. And the whole of life becomes real fun. You are so relaxed that every day it's a holiday. With all the dynamism you are extremely relaxed.

They told me that the whole of Italy is on holiday. They have all gone to Spain and all the Spanish have come here. So I said alright I will realization to Spanish in Italy. And after the holiday they are exhausted so they need another holiday to get over the exhaustion.

So, you just start enjoying, everything, every bit of your life, every moment. Because your spirit is the source of joy. It is the source which gives you the truth. Ask any question, and if it is yes, you get a cool breeze. If it is no, you get heat. And you get an answer to everything. It's so remarkable, it's so great, that I cannot tell you how many miracles take place in your life. It is for you to enter into the Kingdom of God and see for yourself how beautiful it is to be there.

So, now we will have the realization process. [52.10]
