1993-0325 Medical Conference, New Delhi, India

I am sure friends that you must be wondering that we all doctors have been talking and the doctor of doctors who is sitting amidst us has been sitting quite listening to us, we have learned that her [UNCLEAR] and we have taken the liberty of speaking before her.

[Talk starts here] 00:23  

Here we have many doctors who are Sahaja Yogis and also [UNCLEAR], the common point is that quality as [UNCLEAR] that they have concern and compassion, they were not completely money oriented they definitely felt that we can by some level help the people who are of a poorer class or middle class who cannot achieve benevolence from medical science because [UNCLEAR] another qualities i tried for them. [UNCLEAR] compassion has let them to think about Sahaja Yoga.

Sahaja Yoga is holistic in every way, today if i put a hypothesis before you, as scientist you must keep your mind open and accept it, and as Indians i would say it is your heritage, it's not coming from abroad, it is coming from your country from ancient times. To say that i found Sahaja Yoga is not correct, Sahaja Yoga has been there since long and everybody has preached about it talked about it all the [UNCLEAR] have talked about it, Nanak saab has said Sahaj [UNCLEAR Samajika]. So it is not that i have found the method or the technique of it, but if something has done in modern times is this that now self-realization can be given amass to thousands of people at the same time. But this is true for every discovery, if you have electricity now today first it was available to only one person, unless and until you make it collective it has no meaning. The another thing which i don’t think they have referred to at all that in evolutionary process now this is the last breakthrough of your [UNCLEAR], with the human awareness whatever problems you have there is a higher awareness in which all these things that they have described is absolutely possible. As we can understand in medical science we have not been able to solve many questions and also answer many questions [UNCLEAR] specially the parasympathetic nervous system we do not know anything about it, but in Sahaja Yoga we know each and everything not only that but you can master your parasympathetic, what you can worked out it was your sympathetic system at the most in the emergency but with Sahaja Yoga you can master your parasympathetic and you can work it out. So what happens see is like this instrument here you see at, now somebody says that it will speak loudly people won’t hear but if you use this instrument it will work. For a lay person they will think how could be just a funny sort of looking thing how can it work, but once it is connected to the mains it works. In the same way unless and until we are connected to our main we are not understanding our self and that's why there is so much difference of opinion and difference of understanding. So it is very important first of all to be connected to that all-pervading power which i call as divine love. Now when i say that you need not believe it... you need not believe in the doctors also, but there is something like a hypothesis before you that there is a all-pervading power that [UNCLEAR]. Now for example the fetes is placed in a womb of a mother, anything foreign that enters into the body is thrown out, the nature of the body is such, but why the fetes is kept there looked after and at the right moment is thrown out, who does that? Now here you see the flowers... see these flowers... of different varieties, come out of different shoots who does all these work? who does this living work? who pulsates our heart? If we ask these questions there is no end to it, these all can be answered after you have realized yourself. So this connection takes place because of this... you see the triangular bone which you call as Sacrum means... of course in medical science also you call it sacrum means the Greeks knew that it was a sacred bone otherwise why did they call it sacrum. This sacred bone has this three and a half coil energy with in it, now in the practice of Sahaja Yoga you can even see the pulsation of these bone actually like a heart pulsates, in summary when there is obstruction which is trying to push then you can see it with your naked eyes you can see that, not in every one. Now when this power passes through this different center it nourishes them, it co-ordinates, it bring them together, pierces through this fontanel bone area and then connects you to the all-pervading power, which is the power... which is the vital power which has electromagnetic forces, it has got what you call the "Prana", it has got the power of divine, it thinks... it understands... it organizes above all it loves you, it's hypothesis again don't be frightened... it is there...

The second truth about you is that... that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect ego super ego, you are not that. Because you all say my ego my heart my body mine... you don't say i the body, so which is the I, which is the auto again [UNCLEAR] who is the... there is something and that is the spirit, so what you are is the auto is the spirit.

These are the two truths i put before you and you have to verify it and tell Dr Rai that he has to verify it, don't believe me, whatever i am saying [UNCLEAR]. Now we have the knowledge of the roots in this country while the west has the knowledge of the tree, so they treat the tree according to the symptoms like that something wrong with the [UNCLEAR] something wrong with the branches of the tree... the branches... but that's not going to cure the whole of that tree, you have to go to the roots and that’s what the tree that you have to become the spirit so that the whole body gets [UNCLEAR]. 

Now another hypothesis i put before you is this that there are main seven centers, subtle centers within us, seven of them. One of them is below the kundalini and six are above it that's why we say [UNCLEAR]. Now these are the centers these six [UNCLEAR] which look after our physical, mental, emotional, political, social, financial also spiritually. If you see clearly without any [UNCLEAR] yourself, all the problems of the world are mostly because of these. And all the problems of human beings are because of their chakras. So somehow if you can clear these subtle chakras or put them right all our problems can be solved as simple as that, now this is the hypothesis... again... i am not saying you have to believe it, it's a hypothesis. Now these centers on the medical science we have plexuses only the medical will that say the physical side [UNCLEAR] but also it has mental side, English language is funny you see mental means the left side but actually the right side that you see there the channel looks after our physical and our [UNCLEAR] with our intelligence and our "vichar" and all... and the left side looks after emotional side, now only the question of cancer [UNCLEAR].

Now i will tell you about only one chakra first of all is the yellow chakra you see there called as Swadisthan which moves around that void, this is the one which is responsible for producing or manifesting our reflexes but that's only on the physical side. Now how much work this poor center has to do. We have never thought that when we think the energy we use in our thinking how is it replaced, thinking energy from where does it come in our brain, we are using our brain all the time but what is replacing it is this center. So this centers... you know the brain is made of [UNCLEAR], this center converts the fat of the stomach for the use of brain and that's how, this is again hypothesis i am telling, that's how those who think too much go into imbalance, futuristic thinking people planning everything plan this... plan that... most of the plans fail also but they are planning all the time, thinking too much. All that leads to one crisis is that person becomes imbalanced in the sense that this poor center which has to do other jobs also, it has to look after your liver, it has to look after your pancreas, it has to look after your spleen, your kidneys and part of the intestine... large intestine. So a person who thinks too much, a very right sided futuristic person first problem can come from his liver, in the medical science i don't think we have much knowledge about liver, liver is by which we live i think, it's a very important organ in the body. So the function of the liver is to absorb all the poison of the body and convert it into heat and which passes to the blood stream is the function in simple words... i am not using any medical terminology... simple word. So now when you start thinking too much you neglect your liver, when you neglect your liver poor thing doesn't know how to do his job, so the who heat is saturated in the stomach. The person has heat here then the heat starts passing upward, when it passes towards the heart, we call it right heart, in the medical science there is no right heart but we have the center and right heart, it creates problem and that problem is called as Asthma, simple words. This heat then also pass to your throat also it creates a kind of a cold which always flows, you sneeze twenty times in the morning all that sort... there are two types of colds also... we have two types, we have one lethargic liver and one over active... so this is i talked about over active, now such a person is over active. So he develops this cold sneezing this temper, anger, anxiety, tension [UNCLEAR], then this heat passes over it can go to heart at a very young age, supposing there are boys who are playing tennis or something of a rigorous game and [UNCLEAR], this might affect that then have a massive heart attack at a very young age which can be fatal. Now the same heat when it passes through the throat we develop throat problem and we get [UNCLEAR] throat and all kind of problems we get [UNCLEAR]. Now when it moves down say to your pancreas, poor pancreas is also suffering because it has no energy from this center so a simple disease a person like that develops is diabetes. Too much of thinking gives diabetes nobody would think, they think that too much sugar gives diabetes not thinking. In our Maharashtra few have to have a tea properly the sugar should be such that the spoon must stand at right angles otherwise it is not tea and nobody gets diabetes because the villagers work in the morning nicely sleeping down in the night not worrying about tomorrow how to do this... how to do that... nothing... only the people who are sitting on their seats and planning thinking also worried get diabetes. Now diabetes is curable they say it is inheritance also it is curable by putting this center right. 

Then the third thing i told you is even more dangerous is the spleen, now there is the life is so funny that it cannot be congener to the working of the spleen. Spleen works as you know [UNCLEAR] that is simple as you know. So what happens is that suppose in the morning you get up, read the horrible newspaper... Bombay blast this that... you mean that spleen starts wobbling then you don't eat your food properly or breakfast properly just hurry up some or the other eat something get into the car cursing all the people on the way because of the jam, reach the office where there the boss is [UNCLEAR] and poor this spleen is wobbling, she doesn't understand the craziness of this man how am i to produce the RBC [UNCLEAR] this craziness makes it vulnerable to blood cancer [UNCLEAR] because she is so crazy she doesn't understand how to react. Now what happens that this is supposing i am saying to you is the spinal cord [UNCLEAR] and these are centers, this is the left side this is right side. Now we go on working extracting energy from the center it gets exhausted suddenly something will happen some sort of a shock on the left side because you are working on the right side so it bends when it bends the connection with the whole is lost and that's how you become [UNCLEAR] the main cannot [UNCLEAR] anyone so they have to take over. Now the left side is also very mysterious thing which will shock you... i don't know i would not be able to speak today about it that's quite a mysterious things in this left side about which there is no knowledge in the medical science.

Now so this trouble of leukemia comes in then it goes to kidneys [UNCLEAR] it coagulates your kidneys, you cannot pass urine even urinary bladder [UNCLEAR], now you get this kidney trouble you put on dialysis, poor man dies bankrupt [UNCLEAR] no doubt [UNCLEAR] it's fact dialysis has not cured any one so far i know it just makes them live longer and longer and it's a fact, so he does then also it goes down as i told you in the lower portion... and sometimes you do not feel hungry because of the liver plus you feel constipation and constipation can be of the worst [UNCLEAR] that people get that all their nights they end up with [UNCLEAR]. So these are the common diseases which will be facing all such people who are over active. 

Now the another thing that was about paralysis, paralysis also [UNCLEAR] now of course i don't know if they are digging that the brain has double function that the left side works differently than the right side but in Russia one doctor came and asked me this question i said it does... he said should i mention your name... i said mention my name but [UNCLEAR] absolutely the left side is very different from right side, now you can see clearly now you see the yellow one that goes to the left side what you call the [UNCLEAR] and the left side goes to this side up, they cross over at optic chiasma where at optic chiasma there is a very important center which we call as Agya chakra it looks after your [UNCLEAR] body and [UNCLEAR], now when these two cross over like that you see they form a gap which is the limbic area and this limbic area gets closed with these two balloon like structures which we have produced by over activity or by over conditioning. So what is the kundalini, she goes up to this Agya chakra and sucks in [UNCLEAR] and then she pierces through your fontanel bone area, thus you become one with the all-pervading power. No question then of getting tired, now i am seventy years age and i travel... if you ask them... now if you will see my [UNCLEAR], they say mother how do you do it, i said i do it because i don't do it. I am sitting here or i am sitting there i never think i am travelling, i never think that's the best part of it and everything works out because you are in connection with the divine power which is the most efficient government i should say, the most efficient brains intelligence and works so fast as doctor has said that instant i know instantly so quick it understands. Now the best part of it that you all have this kundalini with in you and she is your individual mother and all what you are she has recorded with in ourselves like a tape recorder and she is very anxious that you should get your second birth and she manages the show. Once she does that, it is like a plumule in the seed how it pierces down, we never thought of that how we at the end of the root there is a small a very small little brain or the cell [UNCLEAR] it will go into the soft corners and if it is hard it goes around it, it tries to establish anchorage for the future tree, all these things are in that little stem, in the same way this kundalini means [UNCLEAR] what she does these chakras which are under nourish [UNCLEAR] now nourishes them some of them which are dislocated she push them back and the complete [UNCLEAR] when this starts coming with in you. This is only the physical side of it, mentally you should know me lots of mad people have been cured, i don't want to give instances of how many people have been cured with Sahaja Yoga because the number is so great but you can write to them and find out that people have been cured. Angina, heart trouble [UNCLEAR] even Aids, now doctor Albert was asking me mother tell me about Aids and i will do some research, so let him go into research and then will have next session i hope next year then i hope you [UNCLEAR] eventually. 

But after taking to Sahaja Yoga at least you will not feel [UNCLEAR] you will never get into trouble, seldom, if you get in may be some reason but it can be easily corrected, at least you drop off ten years if not twenty years, feel very energetic healthy and also very sweet [UNCLEAR]. The best part of it that you start enjoying life, enjoy the life this is a very great thing that should happen to all of you, i am so happy today you have no idea because i was also... i wanted to study medicine at least little bit to know what doctors talk about and when i saw that i felt that that time even all these terminologies were not there it's long time back, but i was so ignorant about how i have to talk with them... how will they listen to me they see everything on just superficially how will i talk to them how will it work out, but i told these doctors all over the world, there were doctors from Japan also we have doctors from Russia. In Russian doctors there were three hundred doctors sitting before me and i said [UNCLEAR] medical science they said no more medical science because they are mastered a last bit of it, no more medical science tell us about the divine science. Same with the scientists, surprising they were introspective and they have realized that the end of these things have come we should get something more. Now one thing is it is your heritage it is your own and it takes hardly any time for you to get your self-realization, then it is yours not mine, because there are so many seekers... so many seekers... born in this Kaliyuga that's surprising as he said he is correct that in every program we had nothing less than sixteen to eighteen thousand people in Russia and they are such beautiful people. Now this is our own knowledge i told the Russian's they had some American doctors, i said why don't you tell them of Sahaja Yoga, why should we, this is our secret why don't they listen to you he will not tell us. I do felt first time Indian doctors told [UNCLEAR], now as far as [UNCLEAR] concern as you are saying so that doctors might be worried that they may lose their things. Actually there are very very few people who really come to Sahaja Yoga in a way percentage wise all the rest have [UNCLEAR] there are some [UNCLEAR] people who like you have the authority of doctors [UNCLEAR] but Sahaja Yoga is really today for India is such a blessing, you know what is happening in our villages how people are dying there is no help and this will solve, it has many other dimensions it will do so many things apart from your behavior and all that the agriculture and everything so many things [UNCLEAR] this is not the time to talk about it but one must know that you are Yogis you are saint it is all with in you, you have not come on this earth just to waste your time but to enjoy the kingdom of God. 

May God bless you.
