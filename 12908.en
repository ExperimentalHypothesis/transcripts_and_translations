Evening at Ashram and Interview

[...] is very money oriented and sometimes it becomes very crude also about it. Like I went to Boston and there they asked me a question, how many Rolls Royces She has. [...], how many Rolls Royces, just think of that. I did not what to say. [...] [...] Yes, they have gone through Yog, good idea, started with Yog. I addressed them, when I was in New York They will be very happy to have another program with me. But I told them where Jung went wrong and why couldn’t achieve much in his lifetime. But, the people are, at large, very stupid in America. Extremely stupid, I mean they... I talked to them about [...] and all the mistakes he must have committed and..., well deep subject. Then the chairman, an old man of 80 years, wanted to see Me personally. I said, alright, he came along and then what he says to me, most surprisingly. He says he has a keep, and he had this keep for many years. He?, he this gentleman. He never told his wife and now the wife is dead. Now, this keep is still not so old as I am, and now she wants to go away with another man. That’s his problem, and how can I help him. And, what to do I said. 80 year old man. How far could [...] or what to do with him. Such a stupid question from an 80 year old man [...] I said, Sir I’m sorry, can’t help you. Really, what a question to ask. That he had a keep and the keep is leaving him, and his wife is dead now and he never told his wife. I said, such a stupid thing for an 80 year old man to say. When he went away, I was laughing and laughing, they say, why are you laughing? I said, now what should I do, you see, this gentleman comes to me serious, very serious chairman. I couldn’t keep my seriousness. [...] In, Rome or in Milano they started calling me, the great mother, the grandeur. [...] Yes. There, it’s tremendous. Very well done, this should attract their attention. But, I mean, for Americans I don’t know how you should start. From their keeps onwards, I don’t know... What they think of Jung here? I don’t know, not, I think there is, I think a small society, but i don’t know if they are very strong or not. Shri Mataji, the Jungians made a date Theosophical Society. They mated the Theosophical Society. So i don’t think there is many of them, i don’t think they have their own rooms as such, must be a small group. This Theosophical Society, [...] But you haven’t given the places where She will be, and that will be in the newspaper I think. Yes, this was the poster we handed with it, Shri Mataji. Good, very straight forward, very straight forward. That will appeal to Australians, because Australians are very straight forward people. Written, "elusive union", elusive, elusive is the word? That, "still see that elusive union", OK? Elusive, elusive means, hard to grasp. Its a "e", [Hindi? Ne], is it with an "e"?, "elusive"?, [Hindi?...] "e" is it with an "e"?, yes yes. [...] Its difficult to get to, difficult to grasp. Till now use it, till now, till now. Elusive means [Hindi...] This one, is very [...], I mean, you have written so much, that to digest is going to be difficult. But, one point could have been that, this is the age of our ascent, age of ascent. This is the age of our ascent, is our evolution. See, that sounds very scientific also, Because we have reached the human stage, than we have to ascend after that. And what is, there must be something. So, is one of those things that may appeal to the scientist, lets point. Done so well, who is this one, Stan Bostoc? [...], he doesn’t exist. It was written by Brian Bell This gentleman came to see Me? No, no, it’s made up Shri Mataji, to get the press interested. He’s done it, Mister and Brian Bell has not been into my house. How has he described it so well? Brian Bell, Shri Mataji, and Ian Hanky made the story up. Ah! In America somewhere it’s to hard to check, so it’s..., helps. He never came to London, did he? Brian Bell did, i think, OK no, Brian Bell? I think he has been. The press, the press like the article very much. I think he has been to [...]. Brian Bell has been to London. [...] All this you have given? Yes Shri Mataji. Poor things, they must be already having [...] casualty. It has affect on them, they said it. It has affect on them Shri Mataji, they... Mean what? This has an affect on the reporters, they can be very crooked. So, this is what achieve the TV interview. Means what? This, this press key, plus we had a small video [...] interview in England. I think about Cambridge, Hm, Cambridge color vision interview. Yes, who is given to the journalist. Cambridge one, yes. Was that? You where walking with a reporter, lady reporter No, no a Sahaja Yogi from Cambridge, [...] Jim, a Sahaja Yogi in Cambridge. Jim yes,yes. You where walking with him and the television. He came to see Me. You gave realisation to a lady in a park. Cambridge television. I don’t remember. [...] No, there was one thing that happened, That happened in that place Middlesbrough, is that the name of the place, Middlesbrough? Yes. You see, there the journalist came and they said: Now supposing, who is sick and cannot come to you, what can you do for that person. No, not that one. That one was interesting. So the brought Me, I said than let me have the photograph of the lady. They said, she is the one she cannot get out of her house, and she is suffering from a disease, that she doesn’t want to meet anyone, she doesn’t want to go out. I said alright, let Me see. So I took the photograph in my hand and just gave a bandhan, that’s all, looked at it. And I was amazed that, I told them, don’t worry now for some time, wait for 8 days. But I was amazed the way they where in a [...]. So they went to, after all that, they went to see her. And they found that she had gone out with her husband on the [...] for a walk, you see, that one worked. But I don’t remember the Cambridge fellow. At the end of the interview you told people to put their hands to the television set. What happened?, I can’t hear. At the end of the interview on the tape, that we gave the channel 7, You asked the people to hold their hands towards the television set Alright, to feel the cool. And then they felt the cool breeze? Yes, Shri Mataji. Really? Yes. And the reporter, What will I do with my ears, just now they are not alright with them [...] [...] I’m tired. North America. That’s the story of North America. After a big lecture we give, yes. I giving them such a detailed description, ah terrible. I mean, mental level is, I don’t know what happens, the caliber is, just stupid people. That all sick, sick people, sick. [...] So we can invent stories and things, but main thing is, to reach this people. What is the best way, should find out. If they are seekers, if they are true seekers, what is the best way of reaching them. Lets just find out, what is their problem. After all, why are they misbehaving and not coming to Sahaja Yoga. Shri Mataji we having [...] I use this machine, because it’s so much of, this traveling has made my ears absolute, you see, wobbly. Can hear at time, at the time I don’t, let’s see if it’s working. So funny thing. How much traveling I have done, it’s been to much. [...] Done by one doctor, so the doctor has to put it. Just trying on the right ear more, not so much in the left. Now? Now [...]
00:34:11:14 00:34:18:03 [...] Its better, slightly better. [...] This is the better ear. [...] Try in this one, see, this is meant for this ear. My one ear is alright according, [...] [...] Try again, ha. Something funny. The amount of traveling I have done, you will be really surprised. Even you did not do with this st buses, it was so much.
Its a little funny [...] They said you have to put it underneath this ear here. First of all and then push it back. First you have to push it underneath this and then push it back. You have to push it underneath this, first of all. Underneath that, ha? [...] Now, [...] Is it better?, horrible. First you travel, then you loose you hearing, then you push this in your ears. Its a vicious circle. You have taken all that in that tape, good. So now nobody will trouble me with traveling. That cannot be avoided. [...] Shri Mataji, we have been receiving lots of fan post, people inquiring about the public program. You had lots of them? Oh I see. So we’ll have a big... turn out, I hope so. What, this is what you should not feel disappointed. When I am there you’ll find crowds, always. It happens also in London, you’ll be surprised. This time in London I could not walk through. It was such a crowd. Half where standing outside, they couldn’t even hear me. But, next time they had the meeting, only 30 people arrived. And [...] was sitting like this, what to do. They just want to hear me, all the time. But at least, you have here ashram. They don’t have an ashram until the shuddy camp is done. There is going to be a big problem and till then, they are going to have a big problem, getting people around. Maybe with shuddy camp I’ll do it [...] With the shuddy camp thing they might work out better. If shuddy camp works out in that way. [...] Its a very short one I think, David Spiro has given us. [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] Perfect now. Better, I hope so. I hope so. Otherwise I will ask them to shout at me. It’s better to confess. But, you see the traveling was like so continuous you see, continuous traveling. And also, keeping awake in the night was, too much, everyday, everyday. Australia has done very well in Sahaja Yoga, Yoga, I must say. Has done well. On the whole, if you see. On the whole. Only problem comes in with a, with the government and all those things, you see. Like in Rome the government has accepted. Is that... They are helping me. They paid for the posters, didn’t they in Rome? Paid for the posters. Lots of proposals, and that helping them a lot. So, there are people very constructive by nature. First I went to Rome, it was in a very bad condition. The economy had gone down and people did not what to do, what to make and how to rise, big problem. I said, it’s alright it will work out let Sahaja Yoga be settled down, then Sahaja Yoga started settling down. But I told them, why not people make things which are not easily made in other places, handmade things, like tiles and things like that. And now it’s prosper Everywhere you go, into any shop, say in Belgium or in France, anywhere. It’s only Italian goods you see, only Italian goods. Surprising they do printing, also you have ties, you have clothes, everything from there. Handmade woods, handmade woods Shri Mataji, all handmade. That’s the thing, they took to handmade. Because they are very good at..., very good at. Furniture they make, beautiful furniture, at a very cheap price. Very beautiful furniture, in labour an all that, and they are doing so well. While, what we are doing is going in one line only. Now, produce with machinery, [...] people are feed up. They don’t want to have anything of machinery. Now you can’t get anything here, now cotton is so expensive. Anything natural is so expensive. So, specially in England you can’t get cotton clothes even for children. I think we have trouble here getting some cotton clothes, don’t we? They come from India, don’t they? cotton clothes? ... I can’t here him still well, better try on this ear, maybe. I can hear, but not so well as I should hear. Mind me. [...] [...] It’s to much of vibrations, you see, in the ear [...]. So difficult, takes about a day to settle down. After Puja Shri Mataji, or after traveling. And more with the car journey I get, get more with the car journey. The whole day today We are traveling, you see. Whole day Shri Mataji, oh yes, whole day. [...] [...] [...] [...] Such vibrations, they couldn’t hold my feet Now, what are you doing, better stop. All operation stopped, because they will be upset, you see, to see. Can we open [...], what is your crusade. What is?, your crusade, crusade. Crusade?, purpose, crusade, purpose. [...] , what is your crusade. Crusade, but there is no crusade at all. But what you can call it, is a movement. You see, crusade is rather sharp, isn’t it? It reminds me of the war of the roses, crusade. Or i think, well, my definition of crusade is, it means that, spiritual revolution, yeah, i know [...] to some kind of motivation all through, Yeah. No, it’s a movement, it’s a movement, is a, the movement is, this is, a evolutionary time. This time is, people are not aware of it, but is indicated in many scriptures. That this modern times, people will be so fed up, that they will ascend. They will ascend to a higher awareness, yes. And I am quite aware of that, that those times are here and they have to ascend Now, only thing I have done is, of course i knew, how one can ascend. That there is an energy within us, which is a residual energy, which is called as Kundalini. A very ancient science, but also is used in the Bible, as said that, I will appear before you like tongues of flames. Also Christ has promised to send the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost reflected within us, is the Kundalini. People don’t know about Holy ghost, what is this Holy Ghost. But that’s the energy and that’s the energy of Gods desire. So it’s a pure energy, pure desire within us. And this is the desire, unless and until it is fulfilled, we cannot be satisfied with any other desire. All other desires are useless, because we want a car, then we want a house, they want this, we are never satisfied. The reason is, that’s not a pure desire. Now this resides in the triangular bone within us. What you call the Sacrum, see the word Sacrum itself means sacred. This Greeks must be knowing the word, so they call it Sacrum. So this rises, awakened, It rises like a [...] in a seed, and pierces through 6 centers, which are placed in medulla oblongata, in the back part of our head. And then, ultimately through the limbic area it pierces through the fontanelle bone area. And then, you get a cool breeze coming out of your own head. You feel very relaxed and thoughtless. Now the question [..], in all [...] to east and west civilization is, is the western civilization enslaved by the mammon? And if you don’t know what mammon is, it’s a god of materialism. What’s it? Is the west enslaved by materialism? He’s asking, is the west enslaved by materialism, Shri Mataji. Is the west enslaved by materialism. Makes a god of Materialism, has it made a god of materialism. Yes that’s very true, they are going towards materialism. But they are realizing that’s not the right path. They are realizing slowly, you see. Say you started with plastics, now you know how horrible this plastics is. You started with other artificial things, and you found out they where no good for your body. Then even your live style, when you try to have this kind of artificial relationships, you found out it did not work out. Nature took this respite. So, going to unnatural things doesn’t give you any good results. Now the Spirit is always trying to fight the matter. All the time, the Spirit is fighting the matter, is trying to rise above the matter. Like supposing, we are used to something, we cannot give it up. Any habit formation is coming from the matter. There is, at the same time when people are taking to materialism, at the same time there are many people who are thinking, that there must be something beyond it. Is it something beyond materialism. What that? Is there something beyond materialism. Is there something beyond materialism. Of course, much much more. And you see, actually materialism is going down, down the line. Everything is upside down, that is materialism. An upward movement, which is toward the Spirit, takes you to reality. What is reality, is that you are the spirit, not the matter. What sort of [...] of advice or help can you give Australian to our [...] materialism, who are involved in, or should we they obsessed with that [...], their videos [...] What sort of advice would you like to give to Australians, who are so much bound by their materialism, by their cars, by there videos, [...] [...] It’s very simple, as soon as they become the Spirit, they give up all these things overnight, you’ll be surprised. We had drug addicts, in London, who came in a condition, we can call it as a coma condition, see. Horribly addicted to drugs, overnight they gave up, overnight. Because Spirit is the power. No matter can overpower a person who is spiritual, in the real sense of the word. They just give up. So many Australians we have now here, it must be at least, how many? Oh, there was 400 odd, 400 odd and that was not all of them. They are the people who are practicing, practicing Sahaj, but otherwise we have many more, who just given up all these habits. I don’t tell them anything. I don’t say, don’t do it, because half of them would run away. But it happens, and when it happens, then they just give up. Alright, how do we become the Spirit? As I told you, that there is this power within you, which is to be awakened. I can awaken your power, he can awaken, all of them can awaken. I mean, once they get the light, they can do it. They become a powerful personality, nothing can dominate you, you do not dominate anyone. You are no more a reactionist, but you are very substantial. You see, these days people are just reactionist, they are nothing themselves. And you can feel the divine power, within and without, you can feel it. It’s like a cool breeze in the hands, you can feel it which surrounds us. What inspires you personally to spread, [...] Sorry, sorry, i was asking, what inspires you personally to, What inspires you personally to come out and do this, he said, was the question? So satisfied, once you get it, you will also do the same. It’s like saving people from getting drowned. Materialism is destructive, it will destroy human beings. This one is the constructive work. You construct good families, good children, good people, honest, honorable, virtuous, righteous. These qualities shine trough your personality. Want you have a cup of tea [...], where will you keep. Ha, the table [...] Tell me what is the secret the selfrealisation. What is the secret of the selfrealisation. Secret is that, now, no more a secret. The secret is no more a secret. Is a simple thing, that within you, is the, power lies. Somebody who is authorized, by the divine, is not that a church, or a temple, or a mosque they cannot authorize. The authority cast must come from the divine. And a person who has that divine authority, can give selfrealisation. What would you say to people, for say, Australians [...] I’m dragging this personally, since Australians, but how, how can they help for saving those Australians, who wake up feeling sorry for themselves each day, who have no feel no, further so well in life itself. He is asking, how can this help Australians, who wake up in the morning feeling sorry for themselves, so not having anything to, inferiority, any purpose, or any purpose in their lives. They wake up feeling that they have no purpose, how can this help. Yes, that’s what they feel But you see, once you become realized soul, you start working for god. You have powers to awaken others. You have powers to cure others. And, you have powers to express yourself. And I would say, the greatest power a human being gets, is the collective consciousness. Can you explain this enlightened state that life being struck by a lightning bolt, or what? He’s asking, could you please explain it, is it like being trucked by a lightning bolt, or what, could you please explain, that is what he’s asking. What lightning? Then it takes, for the Kundalini to rise, little bit. Sometimes some people do feel, tickling in the hands, before feeling the cool breeze. That suggests that there is something wrong on their centers, that’s all. These, all these pictures they have given, or whatever they have written about Kundalini, is all false. Because they where not authorized. You see, a person, who doesn’t know about electricity, puts his hands in the plugs and says that, i got a shock. That means he doesn’t know the job, you see. They are not authorized, you have to have a person who is authorized by divine. You must have also a character and a caliber. Not only that, but a life which is pure. There is no hypocracy in Sahaja Yoga, no no hypocracy. Because whatever you do, whatever you say, is the same. There is no hypocracy. As soon as you try to become, say, hypocritical some times, then you loose your vibrations. It’s automatic, I don’t do it, it’s automatically. And you don’t what to loose them. Because all the well being is finished. Is any after life reward for this [...], [...] conscience. He’s asking, is any after life reward for this state. Many, after all you see, but may you say after life in the sense, or after dead. Yes, you mean after death, hm. You see, first of all, when you are not a realized soul, we have no decision power. When to be born, how to be born, to whom to be born. We have no decision, no direction. Then when, if you are a realized soul, like many children in Sahaja Yoga are realized souls, born. Many great people are born. They have chosen their parents, who are realized souls. They are very beautiful children, and very sweet children. Very well behaved and very intelligent. They top the race everywhere, get all the prices, no problems. Just going back to the question about the afterlife do exist, there is an energy. A positive energy or a negative energy? But, after life you mean after death, after death. [...] You talk about the present, what is after death why are you worried. [...] What is he?, It’s a big question seems to found everywhere. It’s a big question what happens after death, that seems to haunt a lot of people. And so do, how do we exist after death was his first question. Oh, I see, anyone isn’t it. Yes anyone. You mean anyone? So when people die, you see as I told you. There are people who are mediocre, you see. They just live like, you should say, ordinary people with insurances, this, that and then they die. Such people, when they die, their soul remains. In the sense, the Kundalini and the Spirit remains. Plus, there are 4 elements within us. The essence of that remains with the soul, 4 elements. The earth element drops out. So these 4 elements, the essence of that, they remain with the soul. Now, if they mediocre, they just hang around you see, if they are attached to a wife, or this and that, they may possess also. They go into our collective subconscious area. Most of them. And are born again, without any choice. But some of them, later on, say, if there is a politician who is very ambitious and he doesn’t want to die very soon, and he has to die, goes out of grace, by something. Then he is born again, in a way, that he possesses another politician. and for the time being, that politician appears to be a very smart fellow, you see. As if he is giving some good, advices and good proposals. But after some time he’s becoming absolutely useless. They become very ambitious, arrogant, and we can say, devoid of all collective feelings. They don’t worry about public they are only worried about their own ideas. But such politicians after some time are exposed. To public, or they themselves feel sick, and that’s how they [...], that’s their situation. Do you expect for the corrupt ones, have to come back in the next life. Sorry, do you expect for the corrupt politicians have to come back to justify their past [...]. He’s asking do very corrupt politicians, they get reborn again as, in a man at, so it’s to justify their past lives. No, they have first of all possessed someone. They try their hands on some other corrupt ones, you see. That’s how we are getting corrupter and corrupter , you see. First there where not such corrupt politicians. Now we find they have becoming more corrupt. Then, the reason is the very corrupt ones, you see, actually are added up by these corrupt ones. They give them strength. So these politicians become extremely corrupt and they are not at all aware that by doing such a thing, we will be all finished and ousted. Also these dead ones, the entities give them ideas, how to hide their malpractices. Will be possible then, just judging by your argument that say many ultimate, sort of able politician arrow people, absolute direct it all, or had some [...] [...] leader. Was, is it possible then that, was Adolf Hitler was he possessed by some other being, or, Rather after he died. or could he, after he died, Of course he could, possess someone? He could, he could, but he has to have a strong personality to possess, you see, he was a horrid devil. Do you know who the premier of Queensland is? Do you know who the prime minister of Queensland is, the premier. The premier, premier, of where?, of Queensland. I don’t know. It’s a man from the [...] He has [...] inspired people by his leadership. [...] [...] What did he say. He said, he hasn’t people inspired by his leadership. This premier of Queensland. Some may say, he’s turning a state into a mini dictatorship. Would it be possible that he, He’s turning into?, dictatorship. Ha, a mini dictatorship is what he has... You see, I would not say about one particular one. OK. That will be this thing. But all those, who become like that, should know, that they are being possessed. And they have to be careful. You see, once you start doing such a thing then they can be possessed. If you try to do something which is not publicly good, and something you become arbitrary, you can call the word arbitrary is better, you see, arbitrary. Then somebody can jump on them, you see, waiting for such a character. But I would not say about anyone particular, in particular. But there are some, realized soul, who can become prime ministers and can do a lot of good. If they take up a prime minister ship. But normally they are not so much interested in politics. That’s the trouble with them. Can these spirits, he’s a bound spirit, come out and cease to exist. [...] Which the spirit sort of people, who are dead, How?, I’m sorry what was the question? Can they cease to exist. How can these, or can these spirits cease to exist. Yes they can, they can cease to exist if you do not use this black magics and all these false gurus and all kind of this money makers, in the name of god. It depends on what you want. If the public wants people who make money in the name of god, in the name of religion, even in the name of yoga. Then they exist, because these people use these spirits only to befool. [...] by Your past, the past definition that someone who, someone say, politician for example who draw, who draw that to the negative, draw that to the negative spirit or energy. [...] They use them, as what She explained, they can use them. He’s asking that, can even politician use such type of negative spirits. Of course they do, they want it. Most of the politicians and also you can say bureaucrats, are more interested by these things. Than by a thing that is pure and simple. they are more interested. Because you see, what they want, say they want a higher power, they want to oust someone, they want to defeat someone, so they use these people. I’m sorry can You just clarify, is it the case of the spirit using the the person, the flesh or is it the or is it the flesh using the spirit. He’s asking that, is it the question of the flesh using the spirit, or the people who are, the dead spirits in this, using the people. Because earlier You had mentioned something about the person, the [...] and getting into the politician or so on. They get in and do they also use them, this is the question. Yes, yes, they do, they do. You see now, do you know who was the guru of Hitler. Lama, he was a Lama, a Tibetan Lama. This, same Lamas forefather. I’m sorry, Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama was the guru of Adolf Hitler. The guru, ah the guru yes, is like a teacher, or a mentor, teacher. Which Dalai Lama, not, a Lama. What are the Lamas. No, no Dalai Lama himself, not this one. His forefathers, the one before, at a time whosoever it was. Maybe his grandfather, because they have no fathers or anything, you see. They are picked up from here and there, like that. He was his guru. [...] Spiritual guru. He was a spiritual guru, he had Dalai Lama. [...] Not this Dalai Lama, at that tine Hitler had another Dalai Lams, who was his guru. [...], this is a response to your question, could Hitler have used these spirits, and he had learned all this from the Lamas. And also the dead bodies, they use dead bodies, those people who practice this kind of a black magic, they use dead bodies. Supposing an evil genius dies, you see, they get after that and they try to get his skull, or something. Just to overpower him and they use him. Did you follow. Supposing an evil genius dies, yeah, alright. Some evil genius dies, alright. So these people come to know that somebody has died like that. So they’ll get after that body, follow that body, is an ancient knowledge in our country, this is nothing new I’m telling you, we know all these things. That’s why we are out of it. They go, follow that body and get hold of the skull of that body. Because we burn the bodies, you see. And then use the, use see bind that fellow, enslave that evil genius and use him for torturing others. This is a very old knowledge of our country. Everyone knows about this knowledge, and they know what this people do, so nobody likes to go near them, very few. But the modern people, you see, who have had modern education, they have no idea, so they go to these people. In our country also, in Delhi if you see, there are lots of these people. Like in Canberra as I came, I said, terrible. In Canberra there must be many. Because My left side was caught up, I couldn’t even walk. Horrible people must be there in Canberra sitting down, doing this kind of work. But i think anyone what [...] the point [...] He agrees with you. Oh, I tell you, really. I mean, I couldn’t walk. I couldn’t walk one step forward. He doesn’t know Shri Mataji, sensitivity to vibrations. Whenever there is power, they are settled there, and they befool these people, these bureaucrats, or these politicians, these people. Just to wound up, a very enlightening interview can this, beg pardon, just to wound up to end a very enlightening interview, can I ask you, do you have a message for the world. Do you have a message for the world. The message is, that, take to reality. Take to reality, that’s what it is. One has to take to reality. Seek the reality, and nothing artificial. Nothing superficial and wrong ideas. These powers are within you, they are all there. You have to just get it, that’s all, don’t pay for it, you can’t pay for it. In answer to your question, yes, you're respectable whether you are a christian or not. No,... I’m just trying to... You want to know, whether even if you're a christian, whether you can still be possessed, or you get into these things. He is going back to the middle of the interview, he wants to know that if you're a christian, means you go to church, or you have been confirmed, or whatever, can you still be affected by these dead spirits. By all means, you are not connected with god. You are not connected with god, Christians mean, doesn’t mean, that you are, you are one with god. You have to be connected, that’s what Christ has said. You have to be connected, isn’t it. He said you have to be born again. You see, we just put a certificate, i'm a christian, so what. God doesn’t know that. He has said it in the second chapter Mathews, he said. In the second chapter in the second verse. You will be calling me Christ, Christ, I will not know you. That’s really, he has said, he said it in many ways. That Christianity doesn’t lay in, going to the church, at all. It lies in, becoming connected with god. Shri Mataji is born christian. Shri Mataji was born christian, She comes from a christian family. So many Christians doing this work. Charismatic movement is what. This seven, or what you call that. Pentecostals, this one, same thing, possession. Pentecostal have you seen, people, Pentecostals. Yes, yes. That’s all possession, yes, yes. Charismatic movement, is all possession. I find it difficult, to deal with them, they are terrible, they shake before me. So, how can it be. Christianity can only be achieved, when you are connected with god. Islam, Mohammed Sahib has said it clearly, that you should be connected with god, then only you can surrender. There’s no connection yet established. But you can profess a connection, can’t you. You can say, you are connected. What you mean, already you can be connected or just be saying it. I can tell you i am connected, just to impress you Shri Mataji. Yes, he is saying that, supposing I want to impress you, I can say I'm connected to god. That is not saying, you get powers. You see, somebody, somebody says i'm now a twice born. Alright, you put a certificate there, so you are not. You see, supposing you are a governor, supposing you say i am the governor of this place, then you have powers of a governor, isn't it. You must have the powers, if you don't have the powers, you cannot raise the Kundalini, you cannot give self realisation, you cannot feel collective consciousness, you cannot feel all-pervading power, you cannot cure people, how are you, a twice born. Just a false certificate. That's why there has been problem. We are dealing with falsehood, not with reality. You see the point. Among Christians also, how many churches, how many fights, how many arguments. Now recently, it was that with mafia, and with Vatican and with, what, the Swiss Banks, and Swiss Banks, are one. Is a connection between. What do you say to that, this is horrifying. And if you see the Iraqi and these other Arabs fighting, how do you explain. Yes and the, the... That's why the young people have no respect for god, no respect for religion, logically. But, there is god, there is god. We must proof it now, the time has come to proof the existence of god. Hitler called him as a very big christian himself. You don't know that, he used to call himself as a big christian, and he protected all the christian churches in Germany. He could manage. Didn't he close down the churches [...] No, he didn't close, he supported all the nuns, he supported all the churches, everything, he called himself as a christian. And he was a vegetarian, on top of that, what is it, strict vegetarian. Only believed in killing people in gas chambers, that's all. Horrible thing. All those who go to church, how much they achieved. How much of righteousness of Christ, how much his goodness, nothing. Why , why it has failed. Because without connection with god, you cannot. You cannot understand religion, you cannot understand Christ. What we do so to, to try and form a connection, [...] we. What he say, can we, do go to church, to try and form a connection with god. You see, the trouble is the one who gives you the connection, has not authority. You see, it must come, the authority, must come from god. Those people have no, you are all simple people who go there, you see, I see them, because I come from christian family myself. There are all simple people who go to church, thinking that, we are in connection with god, but no The person in charge there is a paid employee So, we got it all wrong. He wants to know, whether we have got it all wrong. Have we got it all wrong. In a way and in a way not, because I will fulfill all the promises. That of that I’m sure, all the Christians, they can be fulfilled with their promises. Because they have loved God, they have loved Christ. All of them, all those who have loved Christ, will get their promises fulfilled. With or without the connection. You’ll just now get it. Is such a [...], You can't help without the connection to God, but Shri Mataji says that, you will have it. You get the connection, If you loved Christ, If you love Christ, you will have it. If you have loved Christ, you'll get it. [...] of course. Is it nice doing here. She asked you also, if you would like to have it here. I love those, who love Christ. He said yes. [...] Is not only in the churches, in all the religions it is going on like this. This priesthood has nothing to do with god, has nothing to do with god, that's the problem is. Some of them maybe good, I'm not saying all of them are like that. But goodness is not sufficient, they should to have power, to connect you with god. She ask you, whether you would like to do. I give you just now. I think in my own way, i... You get it just now, put your hands towards me, just like this, and you'll get it, the cool breeze. You take out your shoes, that's all. You can, just one minute, you will get the cool breeze in no time. If you have loved Christ, you will get it. Cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. You all should feel it, now put your hands towards me.

You cool down very much, his face, look at him. All the redness has gone, it's much cooler. No? Nothing. You been to any one of these people who teach and talk about, dead things and all that? No, sure [...] been. Know, you are catching on that chakra. To someone, you been to someone who is doing this kind of magic and all that. No. I've been to archive, went to a false guru, yeah I'm. I'm not personally myself, but i witnessed a few people who've been. You been reading about it. Who? He has witnessed it, seen something. [...] What did you see? I saw, I've seen a few people who've been absorbed by false gurus and who've [...]. [...] What did you see, you just tell him. He seen some people who've been to false gurus, Shri Mataji. Interviewed them, you seen them how they have suffered? No, not how they suffered, but in therapy in some kind of treatment. He seen them in some sort of a treatment, in therapy or whatever they do. Whatever they do together. They worked on you also? No, but I've seen someone who's in my family, have a treatment and this [...]. Have been. He has seen someone in his family have this treatment, he observed it. I see. I see. Of the false gurus. And they suffered, or what? Financially, Financially,... That's the first, that's the first one. How much money you have in your purse, is the point. You have, Rustum what you say? Still on the Vishuddi, Vishuddi, Left Nabhi is quite strong Shri Mataji, [ [INAUDIBLE] and Left Swadisthana. Left Nabhi comes from Left Swadisthana. It should work out, actually his Vishuddi is not so bad as his Nabhi is. Yes, Nabhi is very bad. Somebody has told you that you have a liver problem, or no? Not as yet. Not yet. According to us, your liver is very heated up, alright. And you have to cool it down. Because of that, you have so much of heat in the body, too much heat. Heat is not a good thing, is not a constructive thing. And when the heat of the thing starts melting, I mean other things, you get all kinds of complications from the liver. So, there was perspiration, because it also affects the heart. It [GOES, MOVES?] the heat. You see, makes the heart pump more and into problem. And these are all things connected with the liver. Of course, treatment to liver takes, doesn't take much time. It takes very hardly 2-3 days, but you better take your treatment of liver, is very important. Because if the liver goes out, everything light becomes miserable. You cannot concentrate on anything and you feel like vomiting, you don't feel like eating food and all things happen. And sometimes you feel also giddy and can go into another kind of a, what you call, perversion of the thing. Can become very serious matter. So, right now the best thing is for you to get your liver done. Though you have got cool breeze on your head, we can feel it. Left hand, [INDIAN WORDS] let us see if you can feel on top of your head. With your left hand, just see. Do you feel anything? [INAUDIBLE] feel not anything. No? Can't feel it, so, its alright. The feelings are according to the nerves, you see, that are there. Now what has happened is, that your Vishuddi, this center, is also, because you talk too much with people, you have to talk with them and all kinds of people you have to talk to. So your right Vishuddi is catching, that is this center is catching. That's why the feeling is less, but it is there, he has [...] it. And is there and you are feeling relaxed, now you will sleep well, And if you can come sometime, I'll treat your liver perfectly alright. You must take treatment of your liver, alright? But Australia is known for liver, bad liver. Australia and France, experts on liver treatment. I think they drink and sit in the sun. All that is necessary to spoil the liver, they think too much. Australians also think too much, that's why their liver is not alright. But now you are not feeling better in any way? It is more relaxed. Are you feeling relaxed? [Acha?] now, are you also feeling cool down? Cool and [...]. Feel your hands. Feel cool? Hands are cool now, cooler? Better. I mean there is a trouble that's what is to be cured, you see and has to be done, which will work out. So, any time whenever you are coming we'll work it out, I will get you alright as far as that is concerned. And then you will be surprised, that your dynamism will be so great. Not that in your work, but you'll never be tired, you never have this kind of complications, you will work as much as you like, it will be a witness state in which you will be. So you will never think about it and you will be very dynamic and very successful. But that has to work out, should not just left to be be half done. Alright you understand. You also come along, establish yourself and now give realisation to other Christians. Who are poor thing going to the church all the time, morning til evening and receiving nothing. What are they receive? What have they got? So you will be the real Christian. You can cure people. You can have the knowledge, everybody knows what's wrong with it, on the fingertips. On the fingertips, that's what it is reality. You have to feel it on your fingertips, til you feel it they'll be after you. They are all perfectionists. Because now you have to go, its alright, but you come next day, you come next to that, they'll work it hard and make you perfect. Alright, may God bless you, may God bless you. Thank you very much. May God bless you. Enjoy yourself. Thank you. All the journalist have this problem, you know you are another one. [...], most of them. Their right Vishuddi always catching, they talk too much, even the teachers have the same problem. Its alright, when you come next, we'll put you right. But now give a little constructive report about us. So that we are helpful to people, you know this. Only we need you for this kind of thing, that you have to give them the right correct thing. That see, don't go to false gurus, don't pay them money. Don't do all these things, wasteful things, take to your own style which is within yourself, just get your own powers. You don' have to go to somebody for that, just within you it lies. And how can you pay, God doesn't understand money. Does he understand money? No. God doesn't understand money. How can you pay for God? First thing, the one who says: "I need money for this", then cancel. So many will be canceled like this. You can't pay for God. Its alright, I mean now I'm staying with them, they are looking after me, give me food and all that, that's all. My I'm no expense otherwise. When they come to my house, I look after them too. Ha, thank you very much, very nice meeting you. Oh, now it's cool and nice. Alright, may God bless you. Thank you very much. May God bless you. So, hope to see you some time for your liver trouble. We give you a prescription and you will be cured, alright. Will take no time for you to get cured. All of them had liver, all Australian Sahaja Yogis. May God bless you. Thank you very much. He has been to the false gurus, so he will know now the value of Sahaja Yoga.

What does he? Queenslanders have the highest rate of skin cancer in the world. [...] What he said? He said in Queensland, this is the state of Queensland Really!? We are in Queensland now, that's why he was asking about Queensland. Is the capital, right? Brisbane, Brisbane is the capital of Queensland.
