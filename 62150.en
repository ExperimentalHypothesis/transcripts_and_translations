Mahavira Puja, Niphad India, 07-02-1982

Shri Mataji: Those who are worshipping have to worship all the Deities within themselves, first of all they should be there.

Yogi: Now we invite all Deities to be present for this puja.

Shri Mataji: So the activities in Sahaja Yoga will start now. This is the right side.

Yogi: Now we have called all Deities, all Gods for here.

Shri Mataji: All the [UNCLEAR]. You see, these are ten Gods, Deities of the ten, directions.

Yogi: Now, now the Abhishek will start.

Shri Mataji: The place is important to be mentioned, when you say it. Because of the Deities need to be settled down. It's all abstract.

You are representing all your families, your forefathers, all their relations, all your communities, all your countries, you are thinking of them. You are the nuclei and they are praying for the well-being of all this.

Yogi: Now we have, doing this Abhishek of ghee. Now they will have the Abhishek of curds. You these are known as [UNCLEAR Parchamrudras].

Shri Mataji: Like the medicines of the world. The medicine is the...

He is a scientist out and out but see the dedication of the whole [UNCLEAR famish]. As he is also doing.

[UNCLEAR] collective that if you put that under My feet then all over, wherever this element is, will be vibrated. This is the symbolism of the thing. But very subtle ideas, you see. Which normally people can't accept but it happens. If I am Parabrahma, if I am the Divine power then whatever you will do to Me will slowly work. But that is to be understood and from this angle you see. You see all the ins and outs of sorts, you cannot. [UNCLEAR] You cannot understand.

It just acts, it works out. But this is the desire that the whole world, three worlds should be auspicious. Mangalam.

You are four directions. This is for -

Yogi: Peace.

Shri Mataji: Bringing peace to the whole world.

Yogi: And we name all worries and giving peace to the whole world.

Shri Mataji: Such a beautiful one, they have said that what is to be removed. They have mentioned this has to be removed and the way we are that must be removed. And all of our bad habits must be removed and our fears must be removed. Our jealousies must be taken out, our - all [UNCLEAR ankara] and all that should be removed. And whatever is to be done that will make us all the world full of joy. All the guests to be full joy, all the families full of joy. If you do Guru, guru, guru means you do it. In Sanskrit, Guru means to do. And then... [Shri Mataji switches to Marathi].

You do it fast, you must do it fast and you must bring peace. And you must create a new world. You must change the whole, transform the whole world. A lot of work for Me! And all the people should get sufficient food to eat and all, every sort of badhas they have mentioned. It's beautiful this one.

This is the completion. Complete Sahaja Yoga. Change, change, from change. Complete change of the body works and complete change.

Yogi: Complete transformation.

Shri Mataji: Transformation. Afterwards complete transformation of this country, every country, everywhere they are praying for a new.

Are you fine? Hello.

There are three things which you should respect`is the God and the scriptures and the Guru. So we are saying that we are all together in one [UNCLEAR].

Different things for different things they have offered. Firstly...

Yogi: Fruit.

Shri Mataji: For a, taking us away from the birth and the death cycle which water is given. And then they give you for removing the heat of the universe. Heat in the sense that all the heat that comes out of heated behaviour, violence, all these things. [UNCLEAR] and that we feel so frustrated and everything. We give this fragrance of flowers. Ah no, not flowers but the fragrance that means some sort of a scent is applied. Then a third one is to get an eternal life, we give you this [UNCLEAR], give us the qualities by which we take to eternal things and not to something that is very temporary. To get to that we give you this [UNCLEAR Akshatak] as in this right.

And to get rid of lust and greed, we give You the flowers. See the way we get attached to things and how we get involved into people, to remove that darkness, we offer You this light. And the way we get in employed and involved in to our eight types of work, involved into it. So that you become the witness of the work we do and should feel that it's not that we are doing anything but God doing the job. We offer You the... incense, incense, incense. And for getting Moksha, we give You this fruit to get in because we have become the fruit now. From the flower it has become the fruit. So to get the Moksha, we give You the fruit and specially this coconut, it's called as Shri Pala. It is the fruit of the Goddess Shri. She is the Mahasaraswati. 

To get eternal bliss of Your feet, we offer everything put together. Complete bliss, all the time. There are 108.

Yogis: Jay.

Shri Mataji: Look to see they have done it. He's a, he's got a business of screen printing so he's done this screen printing for you. Jay Mataji.

Yogis: Jay Mataji.

Shri Mataji: They want Me to wear this, this is a - that they wear in the nose you see. They have also given me a face powder. It's a beautiful song she sang to praying to the Mother Goddess that You make a garden out of my life and give me strength so that I can fight the lust, greed and jealousies and the possessiveness, aggression. Give me strength to fight all these things within me. And give me character and also holiness within me, give me character and holiness, auspiciousness by, by creating fountains of these qualities within me.

Should be solved. There is nothing else to be done. Nobody is your brother, sister or anybody unless you are completely one with your Mother. And all the rishis, all the seers have said that you don't have to do anything, you have to be just one with your Mother and She solves all your problems. And when you die, nobodies going to come out with you but accept that your Mother's love because you are born into your good behaviour. Through your good behaviour and...

Then they will move out first thing.

Where is Warren? Better take one or two, he's quite good at it. How come you have given some very nice photographs to them? Never showed Me. I'll see it when you take it from this side, this is some big (taking photograph from below). There is something like a distance that has to be seen. This is some big - the face comes more, there's some sort of a balance is to be a thing, big from the centre you will take.

You can stand up for Aarti.
