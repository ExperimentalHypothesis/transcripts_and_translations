Shri Mahalakshmi Puja. Sangli (India), 31 December 1986.

I have been telling them, now they have to face the other people around. You have the same problem a little more sophisticated and the problems are not sophisticated because we don't have organized religions. Thank God for that also, but because you have organized religions we have to face them in an organized way. For example, now here we have a custom that all the people who have to go to Vital, to see Vitala in Bandapur have to wear a black spot, just the opposite of what it is, but the people but who are in charge still wear them. You are misguided. But the religions across the oceans have become so organized, and they are so solid, absolutely solidified. [Does God has given them?] brain so much they have, have to give up those ideas which are absolutely gross. [They think they will give up those ideas?]. They are so much identified. Church is identified with them. Church has become God and God has become church. Actually in Sanskrit language church, church means, which is worshipped, worship. But here atleast in this country, thank God we don't have such organized. I mean ordinary person can go and challenge Shankaracharya, and can tell him. But not in that country, you will shooting him down or something like that. [There is no other way out.?]

You cannot go and talk to them or argue with them. So best thing would be approach such people who have been, eh, opposing those things but they may be in other kind, another [blinds?] who are sort of [communists?] or things and who are denouncing God. Because if they are denouncing church they are also denouncing God. So you should find out such people who are understanding that there is God [then mutual?]. I think there is a great population of that kind. The way you are talking to them you have to know Bible very well. If you have to be a real Guru you must know Bible because you can not talk to them without it. And also other religions in which there is a complete explanation of Sahaja Yoga. If you know Bible how far it is closer to Sahaja Yoga you can talk. If you know about Christ very well then you can talk to them.

So when they say chapter this and this and this. You should say chapter this and this, this and this. As soon as they say chapter this one and this one your counter argument shows. So you must neutralize their arguments by your own knowledge which is enlightened. The best one you say is that now since Christ departed from this Earth you have been following Him and [you are aware?] what have you gained? - nothing. Now in the Bible it is described that He is going to send a counselor, a comforter and a redeemer, what about that? Why don't you seek for that? The argument should not be bombastic or aggressive but peaceful. In between you must keep quiet for a while, listen to the person and then tell them, I am sure it will work out. As you know some of you must have asked Me questions also and I must have answered them very well. But peacefully, joyfully because they can not disturb you. You have to disturb them and their fossilized ideas, which are to be [defrozen?] and for that you have to have a temperament, a temperament of a peaceful personality. I have told in general to you but quite intensively to these people I told them to make a proper tape out of that and I should translate it and put it in the book that I am writing for the Sahaja Yogis, I am suppose to be writing.

So now we are looking forward to going to Ganapatipule after this puja. I would request you to go with devotion and with complete surrendering that you have to achieve some, something, forget the past, forget the past. You have to forget the past. It is very important that you forget the past and then go there. Whatever has happened, happened in your life, nothing important, nothing can harm you now, you are now like a budding flower and you have every right to be a fruit and no energy which is negative or so called positive can subdue you or could destroy you. Go with the idea that I am the Spirit and I have nothing to do with them. May God bless you all!
