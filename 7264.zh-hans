1982-07-30   大道至简

我想有些霎哈嘉瑜伽士非常吃惊,我接受了邀请来到这个地方。邀请我来这里非常好,在神看来,每个地方都有它自身的吸引力,并且我知道这里一定有很多很深入的求道者。如果我能访问这里,他们将会实在地受益,我也万分高兴来到这里。

现在霎哈嘉瑜伽的问题是可以很简单地理解的,所有重要的都是非常简单的。譬如我们呼吸是很简单的,我们不会为它阅读任何书籍,也不会为了呼吸做任何的练习,我们不需要去到任何人那儿学习,我们只是呼吸。同样地,如果我们的追寻有所意义,我们必须要找到什么,它必须是最重要的事,而不仅仅只是一种替代的生活。许多人感到求道者不是别的,而是在寻找一个生活的替代方式,是当下与常人的制约的交替。

不是这样的,现今,这个现代,是一个在印度古经典中 被描述过的特殊时期,在圣经和可兰经中也有描述,在所有的经典中都曾有过描述。在古兰经中,现代被描述为复活时期,耶稣曾多次谈到它,祂说你必须永远知道我的父亲,你的双手将会说话。祂给了许多关于你将会取得和成为的状态的描述,就跟这一样。你曾见过一棵树要生长,首先它可能只有一两朵花儿,但当时机来临,同样的那颗只有一两朵花儿的树,2年之后,3年之后,突然它到了一个开花的时期,然后就有了许多的花朵。

跟这一样,现今的时代是所有求道者开花结果的时代,如此多的求道者降生在这地球上,尤其是英国。威廉布莱克曾描述到,这个时刻将会来临,那就是英国将会成为耶路撒冷,耶路撒冷意味着它将会成为朝圣之旅,人们将会在上帝的神圣土地之上,人们会来到这片神圣的土地,来参观这个地方,因此人们来到了英国, 不是树会变成神圣的,也不是土地会变成神圣的,而是那里的人,他们的心必须要变得神圣。

他们如何变得神圣?当一个人真正变得神圣时,什么会发生在他身上?我们谈到了圣人,我们谈到了先知,这些人与常人有什么区别?只有一个区别,区别就在于他们的注意力中,在于他们的中枢神经系统中有了他们灵体的光芒。然而对于其他人,没有灵体的光,他们生活在无明之中。

灵存在着,存在于每个人之中,它一直在那儿,永远在那儿,它一直在我们内里出现。然而问题在于我们意识不到它,它还没有在我们的注意力之中,在我们的意识中闪耀。

当加文谈到新的意识,是说我们的意识,人类的意识变得受到了启发,成为新的意识,在那意识之中,我们的灵开始显现。现在,人们可能会说,母亲,那必定是一件困难的事,人们需要做很多的苦行,他们需要做许多的苦修,他们需要去到喜马拉雅山上,做所有的事,行倒立姿势,为何现在它就能变得如何容易了?

事实上,现在这些事情都不需要了,因为时机已经成熟,当时机来临,它就会很快成就,它以集体的方式成就。我在这里和你们一起,在印度,拜访过我的人们知道,每一个我做的活动都有成千上万的人参加,并且所有人都获得了自觉。所有人都获得自觉意味着他们开始第一次在手上感知到无所不在的力量,第一次感知到耶稣基督描述过的无所不在的力量,所有的经典都曾经描述过,你开始感知到圣灵的凉风。

现在,有些人会说这种感觉是由于这个,由于那个,因为我们有时候会怀疑我们自己,这些类型的不相信。但问题是你可以看到,如果很多人感知到从倒三角骨升起的力量,倒三角骨也称为骶骨,令人吃惊的是骶骨也有圣骨的意思,这意味希腊人知道它是一块神圣的骨头,它是神圣的。如今这个词没有任何意义,但是当人们认识到什么是神圣的时候,它会重新回归本意。

在这个骨头里,这个倒三角骨头,我们称为昆达里尼的力量安放在那里。这个创造我们的,创造了整个存有的剩余力量仍然没有显现,它仍然在沉睡中,因为它是我们的愿望,最终极的要与灵成为一体的愿望,是要感受无所不在的力量的愿望,是要成为上天的工具的欲望。

除非这个力量,或者我们可以说这个愿望的力量自身得以显现,否则我们不可能会是快乐的人。你可以尝试任何你想尝试的,在一开始你可能会说如此多的先知到来,耶稣到来,所有人的到来只是为了让我们,为我们可以得到重生的日子做好准备。

耶稣曾清楚地说过,你们必须得到重生,谁为此而操心?有一些人证明他们自己 (得到)重生了,耶稣没有说过要给自己颁发证书得到重生。重生意味着一个人能够感到这无所不在的生命能量,意味着一个人能够让这无所不在的生命能量流经他的存有,并且可以调动它,理解它,这无所不在的力量创造了,创造一切力量的力量,所有的,这个电力,所有的一切都是那力量的一部分,那是创造整个宇宙的生命力。

当你得到自觉时,这无所不在的生命能力会流动,赐予你无限的力量。但是你最大的力量就是爱的力量,上帝就是爱。祂的力量就是爱的力量,祂居于我们内在。 祂非常爱我们,祂是那位想要拯救我们的人,是祂渴望去拯救祂的创造,祂不希望祂的创造,这个祂倾注了如此多的爱,如此多的关注,如此多的奉献的创造。此外,你们是祂创造的缩影,人类是最高的创造。被毁灭掉,祂不能忍受这毁灭。 在霎哈嘉瑜伽开花的今天,人们以如此多的数量得到自觉,这是祂的愿望。

然而,今日最主要的问题就是有如此多的东西在市场上,人们不知道该如何是好。首先,我们有教堂,我们有清真寺,我们有寺庙,我们有各式样的人在兜售上帝。 人们谈论这上帝,或者说这就是上帝。

这些宗教来到地球上,所有的先知来到地球上,是为了在我们内在建立平衡。就如我告诉你们的,是为了让我们为这顶点做好准备。但是,我发现,没有启发有什么用!无论是基督教也好,印度教也好,锡克教也罢,所有这些主义都是狂热的信条,原因在于没有光,你看不见。

比如说,我来此是要看桌子,没有光,对我而言,这儿就只有桌子,其它的都不存在,另外一个人会来然后看到一张椅子,(对他而言)只有这张椅子,没有其它的,他完全相信他所建立的迷思,因为他还没有受到启发,他也不能启发他人,因此这就成了一个迷思,他必须一直粘附于那个迷思,这种胶水般的动力在他和实相之间创造了一个大大的障碍。实相与我们作为人类,在今日所能感受到的有很大不同。

比如说,加文在六七年 或者更早前来到我这儿,在一开始我告诉他,他得到了他的自觉,他开始感受到这凉风,他说:“母亲 我们怎能知道它可以通讯?” 我说:“好吧 你想发现什么?” 他说他想知道关于他的父亲,我说:“好 你伸出双手 然后问我的父亲状况如何?” 他问了这个问题,马上他开始在手上这儿感到发热,这些是你父亲的能量中心,这些是你母亲的能量中心,当他在手上感到发热时,他说:“ 母亲, 这是什么?” 我说:“这意味着你的父亲陷入了不太好的低谷,为何你不给你父亲打个电话问问?非常容易就能知道了。”当他打了电话,他发现,他的妈妈告知:“你的父亲状况不太好。” 这就是信息是如何从这无所不在的力量中来到我们这儿的。

在那之前,无论我们做什么,比如说,我们谈论资本主义,我们谈论社会主义,我得说我是最大的资本家,因为我掌控着所有的力量,我是最大的共产主义者,因为不分享我不能存活,否则我不能享受我所有的力量,除非并且直到我与你们所有人分享,否则我真的不能享受我自己的生活。

在我内在我有许多的喜乐,除非并且直到我与你们所有人分享它,否则我不能享受它,因此我是一个共产主义者、资本主义、共产主义、民主主义不是别的,而是实相的混合物。好比如,有时你说我是我的鼻子,我是我的眼睛,我是我的耳朵,它们都是一体的。

你看不到那整合,为什么?因为你还没有得到觉醒,一旦你得到觉醒,你便知道 我是那整个身体,这整个身体有这不同的部位,但是这些部分没有一个是真正全然的,因此所有这些东西必须以某种方式得到整合。当你成为灵,它们便得以整合,是灵,它居于你的内在,让你成为一个集体的存有。

现在,我的丈夫在海事组织工作,他发现无论他们做什么,在全球的层面,在国际的层面,都有某些(东西)存在人类之中,因为他们理性地做它,他们理解整个世界都是一样的,你是我的兄弟,我是你的姐妹,诸如此类。 然而在他们的心里,仍然缺失一些东西,因为心与脑之间仍然没有得到整合,我们相信如此多的事情,但是那个心和那个头脑仍然没有整合。

你如何知道一个人相信一套,却做着另外一套,因为他们没有整合,当你的心与头脑完全得到了整合,那么你就会做任何你所相信的,并且你相信你所做的两件事情是彼此交织的,那就是为何我们感到那些事情是如此滑稽,他们说他们相信,这是我们所感觉到的,然后他们做所有的戏剧,然后我们发现他们对此没有感觉。但是我不会责备他们,因为他们尚未找到他们的灵,灵会将你完全整合。现在,你得到完全整合的时机已经到了。

现在,来到事情的绝对世俗的层面。有一天,一个电台的男士来采访我,他说:“好吧,现在,你会告诉我说,我的身体的、情感的、精神层面的问题都会得到解决吗?” 这是真的,我们治愈过癌症,一个来自美国的女士,她治好了血癌,当然这是真的,它可以被治愈。

在昆达里尼的帮助下,你可以治愈所有这些疾病,心脏的问题,所有这些都能被治愈。心理上来说,也有许多精神失常的人变成了圣人,许多瘾君子以及各种事情都变得妥当,毫无疑问都可以解决。但你首先必须要得到自觉,没有自觉,没有那第一步,什么都不会成就,第一步是你得到光。

现在有些人会想我们应该非常努力地去做,我们应该清洁我们自已,我们应该做这,我们应该做那,然后我们应该得到自觉,但什么是重点,除非你走出你自已, 否则你不能清洁你自已,你不能看到你自已,你不会明白,因为你是如此地自我认同。

例如,如果你纠正某人你有自我,他会一拳打到你鼻子上:“你说那是什么意思,你说我有自我是什么意思?你才有自我呢!你说我有自我是什么意思?”

但是当你得到自觉,当昆达里尼升起,这里在这一点,在它后面,在视神经交叉处,有一个非常精微的中心,被称为额轮,我们的主耶稣基督驻于这个中心,祂吸入你的自我和超我。当你的注意力在那里,你会看到你的自我像气球一样膨胀,因此你会说:“噢!上帝,这是我吗?”好吧,没有人会介意那。如果你告诉他们,他们的额轮有阻塞,没有人介意,因为他们不喜欢它,他们想让生命能量流入。

然后会有一个带着超我的人,这个人总是被吓到,总是保持安静,变得酗酒,脱离社会,会变成这样的人。这样的人,当他看到内在的光,他会变得正常。霎哈嘉瑜伽使你完全正常,令你成为一个正常的人。

但到绝对世俗的事,像这位问我的一个问题,英国失业的情况怎么办,通过霎哈嘉瑜伽给出失业问题的解决办法,是什么?我说:“工作对你是很大的问题吧,不是吗?”他说:“怎么?” 我说: “让我们看看如何就业。”

让我们实际看看,你们有过度发展的人类,你们有铁路、飞机,你们完成所有这些装备,你们得到一切,现在你们过得很舒适,坐在这里你可以移动某人的鼻子、眼睛,一切,你不必移动,你甚至坐在这里可以毁灭整个世界,你不必做任何事,你已经到了必须要休息的状态,你已拥有太多,只要假期,你们休息,这就是为什么你们失业。

但在精微层面,这是上天在工作,如何,科学及所有力量已经给了我们,揭示给我们,因为我不得不完成日常工作,并节省时间,我们有问题,戴手表,我不记得祖母胳膊上戴过表,你们也不会,那个时候没有人在意时间,时间流逝,无人为此困扰。

现在我们用所有时间,节约时间,节约时间,节约出来做什么,节省时间去酒吧, 或者节省时间去舞厅跳舞,或者用来吵架,或者说别人的坏话,节省时间于你的静坐,节省时间于你的升进,你节省的时间已经带来了这么多的真理的追求者。

现在你有时间,这么多的空闲时间给了你,为什么会将这些空闲时间给予你,是为了升进,现在你已经被世俗的事情,物质利益及所有诸如此类的事情所雇佣。现在你必须被上帝雇佣,你必须寻求祂的雇佣,一旦你得到自觉,首先我会说所有的霎哈嘉瑜伽士必须找到一些工作,他们不应被解雇,但要使你正常,我告诉过他们,但他们现在已被雇佣,他们没有时间,他们很忙,他们给予人们自觉,他们在治愈人,他们出去,告诉人们方法,他们那么忙,他们做着上天的工作。

你不再受雇于政府,也不受雇于任何私人公司,你被上天雇佣,你是自由的,生计问题得到很好的解决,得到养老金。现在你工作,我看到有人80岁,90岁,还做着上天的工作。

最近我从印度到美国,一位先生76岁始终从印度跟随我,他说现在我做上天的工作,所以完全不知疲惫,无所畏惧,他和妻子一起到洛杉矶,帮助我安排讲座, 所以现在新的雇用必须开始,为神雇用。

你会遇到霎哈嘉瑜伽士并问他们,他们是大忙人,他们没有时间。在这里的我的孙孩们也是天生自觉的,他们是非常受到启迪的人,他们非常忙,他们没有时间作其它事,因为我们来到这里,他们非常忙,跑上跑下,并且试图洁净人们。

一天我们去机场,这个女孩像这样作,速度很快,象机器运作,所以她妈妈问她你在做什么,她说我在试图洁净整个机场,并且此举成就了,因为神圣力量在手中流动,所以此举有意义并且她成就了它,她说所有人,如此敏捷,他们跑得很快,什么也不做,他们总是很忙,一会儿这一会儿那,尝试纠正,所以要担当这个新职业。

但是首先,首要的条件是成为灵,如果你不是灵,你不能,所以你要成为灵,你必须理解,如何使用神圣力量的方式,就是这样,如此简单。但是人不应该思考它,因为它超越思维,通过思维你们已经做了所有的事。

但是现在,你必须要进入上帝的国度,成为上帝的子民,取得你的力量,然后你真切地感受到你的慷慨,你的宽恕的力量,让人如此满足,所有伟大的力量开始进入。一旦你成为灵,成为灵是非常重要的。

现在当然,你可以说,有许多人像这样说过,如何区分一个人是真是假。首先,它是一个活生生的事件,在你的进化过程中它是一个事件,正如你已经成为了人类,你必须要成为更高的人类,你们还在过渡时期,你们不知道为什么你们在这里,你们没有意义,那就是为什么你们会有挫败感,这个必须在你们所有人中发生。

现在为此,每个人都可以说,好吧,我必须去体验它。前几天,一个家伙告诉我, 一位绅士来给我们体验,我说:“他给了你们什么样的体验?”他说:“我们都变得目瞪口呆。”我说:“有什么要目瞪口呆的?”设想你去到一个酒吧,并且喝了一大杯,你能变得目瞪口呆。

体验不是这种事情,它是觉知,什么会发生?觉知才是重点,你的意识是否被启发,你的觉知是否有了新的向度。在这个向度,你获得集体意识,你是否具有集体意识?问问自己这个简单的问题,非常容易找出这些人,因为他们做的一切事情都是为了金钱,为了女人或非常非常低等的事。我的意思是每个人都在想做些事情,什么都不是,只是金钱,房子,这些不重要的事物。

在神的国度,重要的是喜乐、平安,是爱,当我们能够达到真我,那时我们才能谈论这些。在那之前,如果我告诉你一个大故事,有什么用,它必须得发生,它必须得成就出来,成为真我是你自己的权利,你不能在市场上售卖它,因为它是活生生的过程。

譬如,假设有一个种子要生长、发芽,它是一个活生生的过程,你能够付钱给种子,现在,你开始长吧,或者一朵花将要成为果实,你能给那花儿付钱?来吧,变成果实吧,就是如此简单。所有活生生的事情都是由这活生生的力量所成就,因这无所不在的力量的恩典,我们成为了人类,通过这个力量,你们也会变成更高的存有。

Sahaja的意思是与生俱来,同时它也有简单自然而然的意思,所有活生生的事物都是自然而然的,这就是为何你不能为之付费,你不能在市场上兜售它,它与金钱没有任何关系,上天不理解金钱,祂从没见过金钱,祂不知道你们人类创造的东西,金钱、贫困、富裕,祂与它们毫无关系。

祂创造了一个美丽的世界,一个让我们可以生活的漂亮的地方,祂创造了,你们去享受它。但是如果你制造了复杂的因素,并且你们变得如此复杂。最好你能够摆脱它,并成为一个简单的人,要变成一个简单的人,你也要到达那个水平,就是灵的状态,这就是霎哈嘉瑜伽的意思。

就像加文告诉你们的,你们要将手朝向我,我得说,我得承认那是我的工作,我必须接受它。但这无论如何不应该伤害你们的自我,因为有一天有人告诉我,为何是你?母亲。我说请一道来,我会很高兴,如果你能够做它,我会非常高兴。

我有一个好的家庭,好的丈夫,我有孩子,有孙子,他们都是开心的人。事实上,他昨天不是很舒服,所以他不想让我来这儿,我说我必须来到这个地方,很显然地我必须去,所以我就设法来到这儿了。他也认识到让人们得以转化是多么重要。 但是这是我的工作,我能怎么办?

你看,如果这是我的工作,不要为此而在十字架上钉死我,我被要求来承担此工作,并且我从事这它,以我自己谦卑的方式。只是要给你一些东西,我没有什么要从你那儿索取的,我位于一个我不能索取任何事物的位置,我只是给予你我的爱,你应该接受它,接受某人的爱会有任何伤害吗?

但是一旦你得到了自觉,一旦你受到了启发,你可以启发其他的人,就好比一只点燃的蜡烛可以点亮其它的蜡烛一样,当那人受到了启发,他也可以启发另外一个人,就是如此简单。

我生来是受到启发的,并且我意识到它,然后我的父亲告诉我,非常直白地:“现在找到一种方法,通过它你可以给予大众自觉,因为如果你谈论它,它会变成另外一本圣经,然后他们就会争论,你会有另外一个犹太教,他们也会斗争,它可以是另外一个伊斯兰教,然后他们也会斗争,最好的就是你给予他们自觉,因为那些生在十楼的人,他谈论着第十层楼的事情,而那些在地上的人们,首先他们会嫉妒或者变得愤怒或者他们会想那个人疯了,他们会做各种各样的事。”将耶稣钉在十字架上,毒害折磨圣人以及所有诸如此类,他对此并没有说什么。首先,让他们意识到有两层或三层,让他们感到有些东西是超越的。一旦他们开始感受到有些东西是超越的,那么他们就会在意识中达到,然后他们才会明白他们需要成为别样的。

盲目信仰是没有用的,同样的,否认上帝也是没有用的。你必须静观这一切,一旦你成为真我,你才会明白上帝。在成为真我之前,你不能明白上帝,那就是为什么佛陀从不谈论上帝,他说最好不要谈论上帝,一旦你谈论上帝,伪善再度开始,因此他说让我们谈论自觉。

一旦你得到自觉,我就会谈论上帝,但你知道他并没有活很长时间。实际上,在他的一生中,他们给予许多人自觉。很幸运我在英国,一切都是安排好的。我想 我必须在这里,因为这里会成为新耶路撒冷,我和英国人作斗争。但四年里我只有六个人,你不会相信,但他们成就了,现在他们是英国霎哈嘉瑜伽的基础。

英国人很聪明,他们很博学,他们不会急于下结论,他们是很明智的人。但因为过去的经历,关于宗教人士的经历,假导师的经历,其他做的事情的经历,有一种惰性安顿下来了。现在,他们真的厌烦了,然后决定:现在,我们什么也不做了。

但假设你在追求,并最终找到了它,你会要求得到它吗?因为你所追求的只是它, 为何不达到它并成就出来?将你自己与某些事物认同没有意义,它们可以是一些组织,一些宗教习俗,一些被误导的宗教或一些宗教行为。

最好的就是成为你自己,然后你将会惊奇你的双手会说话,你自己将会知道谁是真的谁是假的。有一种倒退,那就是人们觉得如果你开始跳,那么你就是受到了圣灵的祝福。如果你开始谈论一些无厘头的东西,你就是受到了圣灵的祝福。

怎能是那样,我们可以一直跳,那并不难,要跳起来很难吗?每个人都可以开始跳,每个人都可以开始像那样说话,这种误解到来,我想是因为圣保罗说了些什么,他本不应该说这些的,因为他并非自觉的灵,他没有权利去说是圣灵,让他们跳跃。实际上,这种跳跃是由幽灵导致的,人们可以催眠你然后让你跳,他们可以施催眠术,我们看到如此多的大众被催眠的案例发生,变成这些人的奴隶,给他们钱,给他们劳斯莱斯,给他们所有无用之物。

因此我们必须理解这种发生是一种活生生的发生,你不能像那样将你的昆达里尼抽出来,你不能从种子中抽出正在发芽的秧苗,你不能把它拔出来说:来吧,现在你开始生长,它必须通过自己生长。同样地,昆达里尼的觉醒也是这样的。许多人曾见过,如果你稍后来到我的活动中,你将能够看到昆达里尼的行进,你可以看到昆达里尼升起的路径,你可以在囟门感受到它,一旦囟门打开了,你可以感到有凉风,从你的脑袋中出来,你可以感到凉风的冒出,并且你开始在手上感受到凉风。

现在你不能做到,没有人能做到,并且一旦你得到它,开始练习,你会很惊奇,因为假设如果我有这个力量或者如果我有金钱,我不知道如何使用它,我不知道钱是什么,这些纸钞意味什么,它们有什么用处。同样的道理,当你得到它,你需要把它给予其他人,你需要照顾其他人,你需要传播这美好的事情,在传播的时候,你不会陷入任何麻烦,你不会遭受任何不妥。相反,你感到极大的开心,有了成就感,我们的生活有了一些意义,我们正在做的一些事情,它是如此意义重大,如此活生生,你们正在做着神的工作,愿神祝福你们所有人。

它是一个如此大的主题,在这么短时间内,我无法解释它的方方面面,它是一个非常非常巨大的主题,现在我只能说,只是在英国,我已经举行了600、700场讲座,他们仍然说:“母亲 请说一些未讲过的,”我无法理解这些,但不论是什么,用语言描述的知识是无用的,知识应该成为你内在的,它应该作为光进入你的内在。

譬如,假如你做任何工作,只是微妙的进入它或者渗入到内在,所以最好的是成为那知识,而不是只是知道并且理解它,这个你们能做到,你们非常有能力做到。 而且这也会发生在你们所有人身上,我希望尤其是在今晚它就会发生。

他们说这是一个小村庄,对我来说,大小并不重要,有多少人真正的求道者正在真诚地寻求上帝,寻找他们的真我,这对我来说才是最重要的事 。即使那里只有一个这样的求道者,我也会去到那个地方,是否有个大房子或者一个小村庄或者一个大城市,对我来说没有任何分别。

愿神祝福你们!

And I would like to have some questions from you if you have any and they you try this process of Kundalini awakening which doesn’t give you any trouble. Doesn’t trouble you. If you have any sickness you get cured. If you have any mental problems, the hangs up, they fall off and afterwards you do feel the Cool Breeze coming out of you. But, after that, you have to practice it a little bit and establish yourself. That’s very important is the establishment.

Can I have any questions from you please if you have any questions.

Seeker: Can you give me any ideas which would help my own particular problem, that many years ago I wandered away from Western established religions towards the Buddhist ideas and now and Buddha as I understand, as you’ve just repeated, did not deal in problems whether there’s a God or not, he put it on one side as I understand it and so I am not in a position to take advantage of the ideas of going through God to a fuller life.

Shri Mataji: So, about the Buddhists you see, as in every religion it’s also in Buddhism. They have lost the essence of it. We think that if we give up Catholicism [and] we become Protestants, we’ll be saved – is wrong. If we think [that, if] we give up Protestantism and become Buddhists we’ll become alright, it’s not so. Supposing we think we’ll become Islamic, we’ll be alright, is all wrong. Because all of them are playing the same game. And the game is this: none of them are enlightened people, none of them are realised. Even the Buddhists, I was surprised that the head of the Zen system fellow who came to India, he has no realisation of any kind. And I was amazed how this man is heading the Zen, in which religion it is definitely hundred times, this Buddhidharma, the founder of that, he has said that, “Unless and until you are a realised soul you are not a Zen.” I mean he said it so clearly, I mean more than anybody else he said it so clearly – even they [are the same]! I was amazed that, all of them have got this kind of a self-opinionated religion. I was amazed! Even this man, the one who said so clearly, Buddhidharma, if you read Zen and his preachings, because he was the founder, you’ll be amazed that he’s said that, “Unless and until you are a realised-soul,” it’s called kashyapas, “Unless and until you are a kashyapa, you are not a Zen.” They are ‘followers’ of Zen! How can you be followers of something? They are blind following the blind. And that’s how they all fall into ditches. All of them are like that. They do not have humility to say that, “Alright, we are not realised-souls. But as Buddha has said, we have to keep to the middle path. Every religion has said that, “Keep to the middle path. Keep to the central path, keep to the normal life.” These Buddhists are they in the normal path? Some of them I have known are horrible people. One disciple who came to me, his name, he called himself ‘Omkar’. He was an Englishman. All his bones were broken. Can you imagine, the backbone, the whole backbone was broken by these lamas! Hitting them on every bone to ‘raise’ this Kundalini! Can you imagine! Such cruelty these people are doing. What do you think of these dalai lamas and these lamas and those lamas? I have been next to dalai lama once, it happened, my husband was secretary of the prime minister of India. And the prime minister’s wife, and we used to go to these parties so I had to go as a hostess and all. This fellow was sitting next to me. He was burning hot and I said, “This fellow is ‘dalai lama’! I can’t understand how is he dalai lama. I mean he’s burning hot!” You see, these lamas lived in Tibet, which is a very poor country. After going there only, we realised how they exploited these poor people. They are so poor. These people are one of the poorest people you could think of, poorest countries. So poor! And these lamas lived there in palaces! They drank their wines in golden cups. By wearing only these yellow dresses you do not become a person who is concerned about poor people there. These were just like parasites! Parasites of the worst type! I have seen these people who follow Buddhism, that you try to wear this dress, make people sacrifice everything; for whom? For these lamas? For whom are you sacrificing?

God doesn’t want you to sacrifice. He doesn’t want you to suffer. He doesn’t want you to suffer at all, believe me! He doesn’t want you to suffer. But you have developed this idea that, “We must suffer for God!” Why? Christ has already suffered for all of us. Or is it anything left for Him to suffer? He suffered so much didn’t he! Do we believe in Him or not? If we believe in Him then we should know that He has suffered. He has suffered so much and now we don’t have to suffer. The only thing [is] we have awaken Him within ourselves. He said that, “Once I am awakened in you everything will be alright.” We have to just awaken Him within ourself. He has done the job for us.

Actually I would say the missionaries from here have never told Indians that such and such [great] person is born. They didn’t. They gave such a bad picture of Christ, you can’t imagine! What they said about Christ was that, “You all should become converted and you’ll be all saved.” And they forced people to be converted. They used to carry Bible in one hand and pistol in another hand and converted people. Now, by branding somebody as ‘saved’ will you be saved by these people, these missionaries? Did they have any power to brand somebody as ‘saved’? They did not! How could they? How did they get their authority? From where? These are all unauthorised.

All of them have been doing things like that. I must tell you, the new generation is now revolting against it. Of course, by revolting against these people, you should not revolt against Christ, not revolt against God. He exists in you. He exists. He exists. When these people gave such a wrong impression about Christ, all the menial castes, all the rotten people, the scum of the Country became Christian. Because they thought, “We all are becoming English people!” Actually people believed in India that Christ was born in England! They all started wearing suits and the way they started wearing frocks and they thought they have become all now English – means Christians. You see this was the problem! But nobody told that Christ was born the way he was: that he’s the one who came and sacrificed his life to save us, to wash our sins. This point nobody said! If they had said that then it is described in the ancient Indian scriptures that Mahavishnu will be born, and he will be born and he will be crucified and he is the one who is going to wash our sins and he is going to be established in the Agnya Chakra. There was no relationship established.

So when it was said that, “Mahavishnu will be born, He will suck all your karmas, all your actions. And unless and until you pass through him, you cannot get realisation.” It is said so that, “Through this part you have to go. He’s the door.” All this is described, “He is the support. He’s the support.” Every time he’s described in our scriptures, in the Devi Mahatmyam. But nobody gave us the proper report then [of him]. Now the thugs as they are, they said, “Alright, your karmas are still there because Mahavishnu’s not born. So you give us money and we’ll recommend to God that your karmas must be sucked in. Your actions must be sucked in.” So the bribing started to God, you see. So all these brahmins started making a lot of money out of poor people, thinking, “Oh for our bad karmas let us give some money to these brahmins. At least they will recommend our case to God and we might be saved.”

All these kind of wrong impressions because nobody went into the clear life of Christ. Then the Jews! Jews denied Christ. They said, “We don’t believe in Christ, we must suffer.” Alright, suffer! They had Mr. Hitler coming down there to teach them a lesson. Now they are making others suffer! Wonderful people they are! It’s all a mess I tell you! One better than the other.

Now it’s time for us to face it clearly. Whatever mistakes are done, whatever disturbances one has created, can be all forgiven as long as we seek and we find our Selves. Everything can be forgiven. It’s like this, that you are in the water then there’s the fear of the sharks and the waves but if you are in the boat, you are out of it. You have to just get out of it that’s all. Whatever has happened has happened. All the mistakes were committed in ignorance. These people who talk about Buddhism and Buddhists, they are all against Buddha. There centre that is catching is of Buddha, you will be amazed. Buddha’s centre is here (pointing to right side of forehead). It is catching. All those who go to Buddhists, our Rita was one of them and there were many just like that, they all had this problem and it was to be corrected. It’s true. We are following them in a blind way I can understand, but at least we should not assert it. We should be in a humble way that still we have not known it. We have to know it. And that’s why these problems are created that: is Buddha greater than this one or Mahavira greater than that or Vishnu greater than that? These are one part and parcel of one body. They are the aspects of one body. Christ Himself has said, “Those who are not against me are with me.” Who are those? They didn’t even allow Christ to talk. He was crucified within three years time, if you see his life with those people, terrible people! Absolutely nonsensical! What was there to crucify Him? But they couldn’t bear that Truth would come, those satanic people. They crucified Him.

So it is the duty of the Christians today to get enlightenment and save all the other Christians. It’s the duty of the Jews, here also there are some Jews sitting, who came from Jew’s land I should say, but now they are Sahaja Yogis, to save the Jews. There are Hindus who must save the Hindus. And all of you have a duty towards all others who are following the same kind of a blind faith. Because there’s nothing wrong in the religions but in the ‘religiosity’ that followed after it.

Alright? It can be corrected. Don’t you worry. Any problems that have arisen people can’t understand when they are Christians, Hindus, Buddhists. How is it their health is so horrible [and] they have all the problems of the world when God is there [and] they are praying to God? How is it that...at least health must be looked after, [but] even that is not alright! Then what’s the use of going to church? And what’s the use of remembering God?

But nothing is wrong with God. God looks after us all the time. Only thing is we have gone into wrong hands.

Any other question?

Sahaja Yogi: How can we Sahaja Yogis work it out when spreading your...

Shri Mataji: The right to the left you have to put [for] him. It’s gone into imbalance. We’ll work it out on him.

Seeker: Should we read The Gita, The Upanishads and should we also read the Gospels as well? Christian Gospels.

Shri Mataji: You see, everybody should read everything, there’s no harm in that. There’s nothing wrong in it. If we can read pornography, we can read [spiritual books] definitely (laughter). But as you said, whether the Christians should read it or not, whether the Hindus should read it or not, I do suggest that these taboos are given by people who want to make money out of you. There’s nothing wrong in The Bible, not a word. I do not find any dissimilar thing, or there is no contradiction or in the Gitas or Vedas or anything. Now Vedas, ‘Vida’ word means ‘the one who knows, the one who is enlightened’. The one who is enlightened is the one only who is the speaker. Now the first verse of the Vedas is that, “If reading this book doesn’t give you enlightenment, better not read it. It has no meaning.”

Christ, what he has said, who is following Him? He said, “You are to be born again.” Alright? Didn’t He say so? Who is following that point that you are to be born again? Who is bothered about it that, “I have to be born again”?

Koran has said [that] there is going to be a resurrection, you are to be resurrected. Muslims, are they following resurrection? Now they are bent upon destroying each other.

For Jews, whatever is said in Judaism is the same thing. I mean if you read any one of these books and anything, it is said that, “You are to be enlightened.” All this is for enlightenment. Because people would have asked, “Why this religion? Why ‘don’t eat this’, ‘don’t eat this’, ‘don’t kill anybody’ ‘be a good person’? Why? Because you should be a human being. And a human being he has these Ten Commandments as his sustenance. That’s why all these religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, all of them believe in the Old Testament and in the Ten Commandments. But to what extent they are going now, if you go and see their Ten Commandments you will be amazed! But to see to the subtle side of Ten Commandments you must be a Realised-soul. For example, there is this commandment that, “Thou shalt not reproduce or recreate whatever is created by the Mother Earth and the Heavens, and worship it.” Now what is created by the Mother Earth? Do they find out? They will find out what is created by Mother Earth. You know when a campus is flown through, you find at different points [that] it just bends. Why does it bend there? It should go straight forward. It bends at one point. They found these two lines going in like that, which goes from north to south and one from west to east. Two lines they meet up. Now what are these lines? What do they mean? Why does it bend? They can’t explain it. They can’t even explain from where do they get the magnetism in the Mother Earth. They cannot explain. They cannot explain many things. Alright. Now, Stonehenge, what is that? I went to Stonehenge. I said, “This is the one which is created by Mother Earth.” You could feel the vibrations. Now these people who go to Stonehenge and do all kinds of this rituals, they don’t know why they go there. In India we have many places where we have these vibrations coming from the stones. And these stones have a form, absolute forms! They have never been chiselled out and you can see the forms there and you are amazed at the forms, how these forms are there. And they give vibrations. For example in a small place called Musalwadi (Maharashtra) they took me down there to find out if that place is vibrated. The question came in about say fifty, sixty years back when a gentleman from England, an engineer, went down there and built a dam. And the dam, at a point, would not stand. It was just exploded. Every time they tried to put a dam there it all exploded. He couldn’t understand. So they called a saint. And the saint said that, “This dam cannot be built this way, you have to go around it, because this place is vibrated. Vibrations are coming out of this place. There’s some sort of a thing that has come out of the Mother Earth.” So, imagine, the dam is like this, and it goes round and then straight. It’s a clever dam, never in my life I’ve seen a dam like that. Now, when I went there I found that it is true. We opened it out and there was a beautiful rock giving cool breeze even in the worst (hottest) summer you get the cool breeze coming out of that place, you can see it. Such a cool breeze! Only a saint can say that because you must have vibrations to feel it. If you are not sensitive enough how can you say? It is [through] vibrations you can say who is a saint, who is not a saint. Because you have not reached that point of absoluteness, still you go by relative. Supposing I come in a sari you may say [that] I am a saint, may not say. You may not be that sensitive to understand. You may understand me as a genuine person. You may say, “No, she is hocus-pocus.” You can say that. But a realised-soul will know who I am. Even if he has never met me he will know who I am. Even [if] I have not met the realised-soul, I will know whether he is realised or not. For example William Blake. The first exhibition I saw, and the last – I have not seen any other exhibition – was of William Blake. And the Sahaja Yogis were surprised why I was so anxious to see William Blake. Because I know who he was. He was a very great soul, very great soul, born in this country to give you a great idea about these great times. But many people don’t like him. He’s gone into such details of the description of Sahaja Yoga that he’s said that, “Men of God will become prophets and they will have powers to make others prophets.” He has used vibrations, the sinews and everything. He’s described it in such details that you can’t imagine! He came to give you a warning. But people think he was mad. Many people think he was mad. I mean, you talk to them, “Oh William Blake! Oh!” They’ll say to me. Because they are not sensitive. They are so gross, so complicated. And this is what he did.

To understand all these religions, to understand the subtle side of what they have been saying, we have to have vibrations. If you read them before you will become confused, it will be contradictory. You will be surprised. You will say, “How can this be? This is not written in The Bible, this is written in The Bible.” They are describing that area which was necessary at that particular time. Then they described another area which was necessary at that time. For example, at the time of Moses it was necessary to establish the religion. At the time of Christ it was necessary to establish the idea of Spirit. And that’s why there’s a difference in what they were teaching and what he was teaching. Because they came at a time when that was needed. At the time of Mohammed something else was needed which he tried to preach. And today is the time of realisation so I am talking of Kundalini and of realisation.

It all is, one after another, we can say, is the opening of the petals of the beauty of Divine. And because a fruit has appeared on the tree will you deny it because last year there were only flowers and today there are fruits? It has come out of the same flowers. These all flowers grew on the same Tree of Life, but at every time they plucked it out [then] they were dying, then they became ugly. They started saying, “This is mine, this is mine, this is mine,” and they are fighting with the dead, nothing living. I am talking about the living God and not of the dead.

So reading any book is just the same, makes no difference. But after enlightenment you will understand that there is no difference in any one of these books. There’s nobody as just chosen by God and the others are discarded. Is a wrong idea we have got. These are all mythical ideas. Our forefathers have lived with it, their forefathers have lived with it. And they cut each other’s throat on this point – what have they achieved? Nothing. This whole world is created by God not for fighting with each other in the name of God! How many fights we have had so far thinking that we are better than others. These are all wrong ideas.

First of all you get your realisation then you will know that they are all part and parcel of one God. So reading all these books is not going to help you till you get your realisation. Alright? So first you get your enlightenment then we’ll talk about the books. Books do not give you the real knowledge, they do not give you realisation. Everybody has been reading books. Anybody can write books. I tell you Christ never wrote any book. Very easy to write books. Anything you want to write, you just have to have little money, that’s all. People have written about witchcraft, about satanic forces. Everything they write. If they have money they can write about anything. So how will you know this is true? Unless and until you have that absolute being awakened within you which gives you absolute values of these.

Now any more questions?

Seeker: Would you say that everybody in the world now is a reincarnation or are there still original souls coming into the world?

Shri Mataji: No, no. They are all reincarnations. No doubt about it. And there are great souls which are being born, who are realised souls. Many children in England are born as realised-souls. This is the time of what we call The Last Judgement. You are going to be judged by your Kundalini, by your awakening [and] by nothing else. Nobody is going to put us on a weighing machine to see. It’s how far you go with your realisation. This is the judgement time that has come. All of us have to get it. As many as can but I don’t know, [the Gospel of] John says that only 144,000 in this whole world! It’s not even 0.000001%! That’s not so. How can it be?

Seeker: Is it not possible for 144,000 maha-mahatmas?

Shri Mataji: Maha-mahatmas? There are so many. Many, many more. They are doing their jobs alright. There are thirty-five crores of devas. But they are all busy doing their job. But you are on the stage. They are working out for your realisation. You are on the stage. Like on the stage when actors enter, they are helped by everybody around – they are in the background. Like that there are so many. That’s what I said that the Divine Itself is anxious to help. That you will realise very soon, as soon as you get your realisation, how you are helped by angels every moment, every minute. Now there are Sahaja Yogis who are smiling because they are all being helped like that. Every second you will find that you are being helped by the Divine. It’s true. I’m not telling you fantastic stories. It’s a fact. Believe me. We live in a world where we have no light, so we believe that way, but once the light comes in you’ll be amazed how you are placed. Just they are ready to do anything that you want. Actually your wantings change, your priorities change. You start wanting something that you never wanted before.

Should we start now?

(to the children) You sit down here quietly. All of you sit down here quietly. (Children are laughing and playing)

You work on him?

Sahaja Yogi: He’s blind Mother.

Shri Mataji: He’s Blind?

Sahaja Yogi: He comes to the meeting in Manchester.

Shri Mataji: When did it happen?

Blind Man: One eye forty odd years ago and the other eye fairly recently, but I can still see just a little.

Shri Mataji: Can you come to London?

Blind Man: Actually my youngest son is married and he’s living in North London and I’m hoping to come down and see him in a few weeks time.

Shri Mataji: You do come along there, now! I am in London these days and we’ll work it out. Alright? Please come, because we’ll have to work it out. It will take some time.

Where did you go for this Buddhism?

Seeker: Well, the story’s much more complicated that and I think it would only confuse the meeting if I were to tell it.

Shri Mataji: Alright, so you come along. Best thing would be [that] you come along. But first of all you write to us and then they’ll let you know. And whatever is the best time, do come there. It’s not difficult. His Agnya’s caught up completely there. That’s all. And let us know your story also if you don’t mind, when you come there. I’ll have to give you some time. Alright? And you’ll have to give some time to yourself.

Yes my child?

Seeker: I’ve got a much more physical fault with my sacrum joint and I wondered if it actually did any damage to the Kundalini? Would it damage it at all?

Shri Mataji: Alright, we’ll see about it.

(Talking about a small child) I don’t know what’s the matter with her today she’s over dynamic. Go and get some flowers for mana. (Child runs off to get flowers, Mother laughs) How free they are! Such a source of joy isn’t it? Alright. So should we start? I think lights are too many here. Could you put off some of the lights?

Is he from some magazine? Which magazine?

Journalist: I’m freelance.

Shri Mataji: You have a magazine of your own?

Journalist: No, just freelance.

Shri Mataji: Recently there was somebody taking my photographs in Delhi, and I didn’t know what he was doing. And then they had a very big article, it came in one of the magazines, you see, which we received in London and I was amazed, the way he was going round I didn’t know he was going into such details about our programmes. And he really wrote very beautifully. You saw that one? Surprisingly I didn’t even know the fellow who he was. I wish I had asked him I thought, who he was. He had written very beautifully and in a very well known magazine which actually deals with more economics and economic affairs. Imagine to put God in there! But he did it. He did it and they published it and it was a very ‘wrong’ magazine. And to support it he got something from other Sahaja Yogis and some scientists and all that. And from them also he got one or two articles to be published. And I didn’t know how he was working it out. But when I saw the magazine I was amazed how he could write all about you!

But why I saw this [is] because he was also taking my photographs all the time so that’s why I asked you. I hope you don’t mind.

Journalist: No Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Alright. Close your eyes now. Because he got his realisation and then he did [the article]. After realisation he worked it out. He was a very genuine man, quite old. I didn’t know really that he was from the magazine but when they wrote to me, the report about him, and I was amazed [that] he was above seventy years of age! And he did so well.

If you can close your eyes. Just please close your eyes.

You have to trust yourself and not to doubt yourself. It will work out in all of you, I promise it will. But don’t doubt yourself.

Also one should not feel guilty. That’s a very bad habit of feeling guilty. All the time, “I’ve done this wrong, that wrong.” In the presence of God you are not guilty at all because He is the ocean of love, the ocean of compassion, the ocean of forgiveness. So give up all that. Just, to begin with, I ask, request, all the people to say, in their hearts, that, “Mother I am not guilty.”

Now, you have to forgive others. Forgive everyone. You might say that, “Mother how can I forgive? I can’t forgive.” But really it’s a myth that we don’t forgive. What do we do when we say we forgive? Nothing!

Actually by remembering all the horrible things done to us we ruin ourselves, we trouble ourselves, we torture ourselves. Just to say, “Mother I forgive.” We have to forgive, as in the Lord’s Prayer, “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them, those who trespass against us.” First we have to forgive those who trespass against us so that our God, God Almighty, will forgive us for our trespasses.

These are one of the loads that human beings carry, that they find it difficult to forgive others, that they feel guilty all the time. As I have told you that Christ came on this earth to suck in all our sins and our mistakes.

Now put your right hand on your heart and say in your heart, “Mother I am the Spirit.” You are the Spirit. Just you have to assume. Just say. Say it thrice, with full faith that you are the Spirit. You are the Spirit.

Say it and you will feel the cool breeze in both the hands. In the left hand you will feel the cool breeze. Or ask the question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Just ask the question “Mother, am I the Spirit?” You will find the cool breeze in the hand flowing.

Now, if not you put your right hand on top of your forehead with the left hand towards me and just say, “Mother I forgive everyone.” Put it on your forehead because Christ’s place is there. “I forgive everyone.” Just on the forehead.

“I forgive everyone.” Please say it.

Now you must know that God has given you freedom. In your freedom you have to ask for your realisation. I cannot force it on you. I cannot say that, “Alright, you can get your realisation just like that.” You have to ask for it. If you don’t ask I cannot get over your freedom, that’s given to you. God cannot take away what He has given to you.

Now put your right hand on top of your head at the fontanelle bone area, higher than your head, and say, “Mother, please give me my realisation, I want my realisation.” You have to say that, otherwise it’s not possible for me. I cannot cross over to your freedom. You have to come forward to get it.

You’ll find a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now if you are tired put your right hand towards me and left hand [above] and you should get it [on that hand] also again.

The Sahaja Yogis can go and see now if you are getting cool breeze and if you are realised. We have some of them here and they can look after you. Don’t get upset with them. You can do the same tomorrow.

I request the Sahaja Yogis to find out.
