Today we are lost in the Shabad Jalam We say mantras, we read books, there are Shaivaites and Vaishnavities. All these things to us have been important also because we thought by following these methods, we will achieve our moksha, our last goal. This way I must say that Indians are very alert and basically spiritually minded. They also know what is wrong and what is good. They also know what is dharma and what is not Dharma They will do wrong things. They may take to things which are absolutely against their spiritual life, but in their heart of hearts they all know that this is wrong, but they can't help it.

We have to understand that we are specially blessed by people who were our forefathers who were great seers, saints and incarnations and who gave so much time for the emancipation of our spiritual life. To them material life was not so important. Specially in the South I feel that people are deeply rooted into Dharma. I read about Shalivahana who met Christ once in Kashmir Christ told him that ‘I come from the Country of Malekshas. (Mal-iccha) means desire for filth. Their desire is towards mat not towards purity and I have come here because you people are absolutely Nirmal - Pure. Shalivahan told him 'Why do you want to come here. You should go and work for those people who are malekshas'. We are different type of people even today Even in this Ghor kaliyuga atleast 70 percent people believe in God, have faith and fear of God.

All this that we have is nothing but a kind of awe. a fear of the unknown. We don’t know that God almighty is the ocean of compassion and love. We human beings have to achieve a state to know Him. We don't know God. We don't know ourselves. First we have to know ourselves. Once we know ourselves, then only we will know God. I have seen ritualistic behaviour in the South very much. I was surprised how people were doing everything with their heart, but they did not know why they were doing it. They have such Bhakti but such a blind Bhakti that it will lead them no where. I used to think that when will I be able to tell them to be beyond this. You have to have Shraddha and Shraddha is enlightened Bhakti. Unless and until you have your enlightenment the Bhakti has no meaning. Like this mike if it is not connected to the mains it has no meaning. Unless and until you connect it to this all pervading power of Divine Love which we call as Brahm- Chaitanaya Our Bhakti has no meaning because there is no connection like telephoning to someone without the connection. The simple thing is that this connection, this Yoga has to take place. You might have read lots of books or may know so many things like Vedas. So what7 Its like you have a headache and the doctor suggests a medicine He writes the name of the medicine. You are reading the name of the medicine but are not taking the medicine. When are you going to take it ? Unless and until you take that you are not going to achieve by any chance whatever is promised to you. because it is such a deep ignorance about all these ideas we have learnt and has penetrated into us. Such a lot of ignorance. That ignorance is really like a ditch of^no return. I have seen people who have read books after books. There are people who do one lakh mantras, fasting and reach nowhere. They are the most hot-tempered people or they have no joy In their heart. They leave their families come out of it and think that they have done a great sacrifice. God does not want all this non-sense. Why will God who is your father who is so compassionate and loving personality want you to suffer?

Why should you suffer? By suffering how will you gain moksha is beyond me. If you take it the other way as Kabir has said. 'By starving if you are going to achieve your moksha then already there are many people who are starving in this country so they will all get their moksha. He says if by shaving your head you are going to get moksha then the sheep which is shaved every year should be there before you are there'. They all have made fun of them. They have all said all kinds of things for you to know that all these outside things are of no help, Of course you do it genuinely, because you want to have your liberation, your enlightenment. As a mother, I tell you. you don't have to do all this. Please don’t do it. First of all if you want to upset your mother you always say I will not have any food. So why do you want to do it. There is no need. So much importance is given to food. You get up at 4 am and go on chanting something and the whole house is up.

Apart from that the other influences are of false Gurus. Madras is full of them, everybody seems to be some sort of Guru slave. But worse is Calcutta. Everybody is a dikhit (got diksha from a guru) and tantrikas, when you have these bad Gurus they create such negativity that they cannot prosper. The Laxmi Tattwa goes out. Because of that the poverty will never go. Unless and until you get rid of all these horrible Gurus, We have them everywhere in India. But here the people are so simple and hero worshippers.

As the Muslims have Jehad we are having Jehad against ourselves. We are killing ourselves, don't eat food, don't do this, do that all the time after our lives. God has created this world for your comfort and enjoyment. Why did he create this world if you had to go through such hell.

In Sahaj Yoga you know your identity. You understand how glorious you are once you are connected to the mains you know what powers you have. How beautiful you are within and you start respecting yourself. You don't have ego but you have a right idea about yourself. I’m so happy, I see so many people here who are willing to take to Sahaj Yoga, who are in Sahaj yoga. Of course it cures people, it has cured many people. Apart from that it also gives you mental peace. Emotionally you become a very balanced person, but above all you get the power to give realization to others. First you get your nirvichar samadhi and then you get your nirvikalpa samadhi. You all get it as soon as you are connected to the mains. Its a very remarkable thing^. A Sahaja Yogi in Bangalore told me he was doing tissue culture. Only 50% is successful. But I am a Sahaja Yogi. I just stand here and give vibrations, they pass through the bottles and my success is 100%. He is a farmer he does not know even English but he says, 'Mother, there is such knowledge within myself I can feel it'. This is what one has to know that what you are not. This is very important to know that we are not ordinary human beings. First of all you have come to this programme because you are seekers. You are special human beings. Then you get your realization. You get all your powers. You need not be a P.H.D. etc. You need not be a big successful person. Those who think they are very successful will never get realization, because they are lost to normal common sense, like bureaucrats, ministers, are very difficult. So how do they get it? They get it when they have from inside innately thing desire to achieve it. Just to feel that way. It is a such a remarkable thing that everything is tangible. Even the small children can tell you what's wrong with you, which chakra is bad. Its such a great discovery which we don’t realize, may be because we have no sense of our spirituality.

When I went to Russia, the oldest University in Leningrad, St.Petersburg University gave me a big award. They made me one of the 10 members of the University- I looked at the award and said 'I'm just a housewife I'm not a Scientist'. One of the recipients of this award was Einstien. They said 'What has Einstein done. He has just managed the material side. He worked on matter, while you have worked on human beings'

Things are going to work out. You should all move out from all this kind of darkness and get into the light. See for yourself. What you are. First of all to be born in this country means you have really something special. Such a blessing, it is you have no idea. This mother earth, nowhere you will find such a mother earth in the whole world. But you have to have your realisation otherwise you cannot value it. That is why I want you to understand that even if you get your realisation, try to understand that you have achieved something exceptionally in life which you could not have had. Its tangible, you can find out on your finger tips about anyone, or yourself, theirs and your chakras.

Such a big gift is there and I would request that you should utilize this gift by gifting it to others who have not received it. Thats the greatest thing you are to do and you will be joining into a very very big global group which is the living organisation of Sahaj Yoga. All over the world you will have friends. All over the World they will know you. As you are here in Sahaj Yoga you have to understand that all your customs, relations anything is respected. Nobody will say don’t do this or don't do that. But you yourself will become your own Guru, because there is light in your attention.

May God Bless You.
