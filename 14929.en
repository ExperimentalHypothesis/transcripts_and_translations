Talk to Sahaja Yogis during Entertainment Programme, 30 August 1983, Geneva, Switzerland

Shri Mataji: And the road ...

Yogi: Mother, actually this place is colder,I am also impressed.

That’s what I’m saying, it’s a fact. And the street which has a cool breeze. It’s such an expression of the unconscious as to what we are going to do in this place. Even when you get your realisation, you are still sometimes in a growing stage up to a point. Like you are by the Mother Earth all the time but you are not aware of it. In the same way, the womb of Sahaja Yoga nourishes you to grow up into beautiful beings. Till you have to come up to a point when it has to click in such a way that you start feeling the awareness of that abounding love. In small children, it clicks very fast because they are so innocent and uncomplicated. And in some people also I have seen it clicks very fast as soon as they get their realisation. But in some people, they havesome more ego trips left to be finished. So they come to me I find they are flying in the air like bubbles and as if blown by the nourishing mother. Blow now, like the bubbles on the surface of the sea. And there are many who are suffering from superego. They get mixed up with the sand and become very heavy and all the time weeping, crying and making complaints about personal things. But once this thing clicks they become one with the spirit of the ocean. Then they feel that deep joyousforce of the sea which nourishes them, guides them and elevates them every moment. Like deep down into the sea they go and there they find the beautiful pearls of eternal experience. And when they find these pearls they bring to Me as poems, as dances, as smiles, as laughter, as enjoyment. These are all within you and they lie there away from your consciousness. Though your consciousness is enlightened by Self-Realisation it is not yet enlightened by joy. That is something happens to all of you gradually as I told you and should happen to all of you as soon as possible. What is there to surrender to force that itself is flowing towards you andnourishing you? Do we say that the lotus has surrendered itself to its fragrance? Do we say that the sun has surrendered itself to its brilliance? Do we say that the moon has surrendered itself to its coolness? It would be absurd to say like that. The word surrender sometimes can mean only at the most in the text of Sahaja Yoga that we surrender our egos, our limitations, our shallowness and what we have achieved is our depth, our own.

We have surrendered all that is useless for something that is so great and eternal.This weight of ignorance has to drop off. I don’t know what I do? I don’t think I do anything because I am really doing nothing! Sometimes I think that this is not my due to be placed like this. Because whatever is my nature that is what I am. And I have not achieved anything.I just exist by with my nature because I can’t do anything else. While you have achieved! It’s great credit to you! Very great credit to you.Better say credit to youthat you have achieved this enlightenment to see yourself, your true self which is so joy-giving. Actually, I should compose a poem in praise of you. And I do my best to show by My own method how the Divine is pleased and that you see everywhere, every time and every moment. So tonight you all have to say only one thing in our hearts that this bountiful nature of motherhood should be brought into our consciousness which I told you is called as ‘Rithumbara Pragnya’ means your consciousness when gets enlightened to that nature of this Mother Earth which fills it up with different seasons. That is ‘Pragnya’ that happens to everyone I said, but it happens more to  people who try to be in the centre and don’t go to an ego trip. Some Sahaja Yogis I have known have been boasting that I am the one who is going to establish Sahaja Yoga here and I am this and I am that, I am a special person and Mother has selected me. Anyone who thinks like that is no more a Sahaja Yogi. It’s like he is holding on to a tree and thinking that by holding on to one leaf he is going to dominate the whole tree. Such a person just will have that little leaf in his hand which will also die out after some time. You have to run in the veins of the roots, of the branches, of the leaves, of the flowers andof the fruits. You have to be the essence of the tree that nourishes and not just the outward leaves with wrong ideas about yourself. And the people with the superego who are limited by their small personal problems also must know that they will have the same faithin Sahaja Yoga. Put the problems of the tree always ahead of the problems of a leaf. Now it is high time to jump from that little area to the vast area which has no bounds. And once that happens you will be surprised that all these little petty problems will drop out in the ocean of greatness. Don’t indulge into them. And leave them in the hands of the tree, so that all your small petty problems will be looked after by that nourishing force. Because you belong to a very great tree of wisdom, tree of great sustenance, and religion and tree of great mastery. The mastery that you can never know how great it is. You belong to a tree that has complete security for youand you belong to a very great tree which gives you complete witnessing of the drama. And which gives you an understanding that the whole is a part and parcel of you and you are part and parcel of the whole. So you belong to the great ocean of love and generosity. So this great tree of life has everything integrated within itself. This is the tree of life that has been described in the Bible. “Tree of fire” they call it. Now you have become one. You are blessed by it. You are loved by it. You are gently guided by it. It’s so gentle that you do not even feel the guidance. Like a leaf when it falls on the ground doesn’t make any sound.

Try to become identified with that power, that is what you are. Like the meaning of the word is identified with the word. Like the moonlight is identified with the moon, the sunlight is identified with the sun. Let the identification be like that. That oneness, that integration so that you become the light of that God’s love, that people know God through your deeds and your fruits is the most fulfilling job, highest-paid, the more satisfying, energy-giving and dynamic. Don’t have to give up anything. Just be organised in the light of spirit yourself. 

I must thank you very much for the nice entertainment you had for me. It was really a surprise! The great surprise of tremendous joy. Thank you very much.
