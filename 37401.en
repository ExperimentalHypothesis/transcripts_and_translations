Shri Mataji: Turn your cameras to them also. I would like to ...

Sahaja yogi: Now welcome song would be there [children sang the song]

Shri Mataji: Respected chairman Mr Maitrey of the Shivaji Education Society, respected headmaster of the school and of the public school, all the students, and all the teachers who have gathered here to respect the saint...Today my heart is filled with tremendous satisfaction that I feel now that the Satya Yuga has come! Before this, the saints were never respected...Even respected by few were tortured by many...Today to see these young students with such discipline, respecting a saint, I am not a politician, I am not a business lady....neither I am a learned lady of some university ...I am a simple saint of this country.And that I should be respected by you all shows the recognition of the divine today.This is the basis of Sahaja Yoga ...The basis of Sahaja Yoga is this that whatever this great saint like Shri Gyneshwara, Nama deva, Sant Tukaram, Ram Das Swami, Eknath and so many others like NanakSahib, Kabir Das, and so many Muslims also like Nizamuddin, ...Khwaja Nizamuddin and Chisti ...All these great people have been warning this country, have been talking about the divine They are been saying there is the divine surrounding us but nobody could recognize them ...Because they were not realised souls And this is the reason why Sahaja Yoga had to come to make people self-realized and they can feel the divine all around...

That you can see today on behalf of all the western Sahaja yogis, all foreigners were here. I thank you, sir, very much ...For showing them how in this country we are thefirst to recognise ...On such a large number of people by a recognised institution which is a very rare site ...Was before in this country also and is a rare site also in the western countries...Its such a remarkable thing and I hope this will open the eyes of other people also to see how a divine personality is to be recognised. Superficially, the divine personality has nothing to offer but in the depth of heart, it can introduce you to the divine which is surrounding us and blessing us. We all have had experiences of the blessings of Sahaja Yoga ...And there are so many o you from western countries can tell these young people about their experiences -What they have achieved through Sahaja Yoga But today to hear from the headmaster about the divine blessings working in the school is very gratifying. May God bless them and give them a hand ...

[In Marathi, then Self-realisation in Marathi and then the description of some extracts in some book ]

On the shores of Bharat,Where men of all races have come together,away oh my mind standing here with outstretched arms,I send my salutations to the god of Humanity andin solemn chant, sing his praises ...At whose call no one knows,came floating streams of men,and merged into the sea of Bharat ...The Aryan,the Non-Aryan, the Dravidian, the Hoons, the Pathans, & the Mughalsthey all have merged here into one body.Today the west has opened its door...And from them comes gifts ...Giving and taking and will be welcomedOn the shores of Bharat where men of all races have come together .....

(This is the description.)

In man exaltation,singing songs of victory,have they come crossing deserts and mountains?They all dwell within me and in my blood echo their very melodies or a terrible one. Let the heavens resound with your music,even those whom in this day we kept apart will gather around the,Oh, Bharat- When the men of all races have come together...

Here is one day in the hearts of men,the message of the one is resounded in the fire of "tapasya".All differences were forgotten,And they may be forged into one...Round that fire of sacrifice...We all have to meet with bowed heads,and unite.On the shores of Bharat - Where men of all races have come together...In that fire, the bloodshot play of suffering is a glow ...Oh Mind! Bear this suffering andhear the call of the one conquer all shame, all fearand let vanish all humiliationsWhat great life will emerge at the end of the days of sufferings.The night ends when the great mother is awakened ...

The great mother is awake on the shores of Bharat...

Where men of all races have come together...Come Aryan and Non Aryan!Hindu or Muslim!Come O English! and you Christian! Come, O Brahmins!Purify your minds and class the hands of all ...Come Oh downtrodden!And Let vanish all the burdens of humiliations!Tally not but come you all to annoy the mother ...On the shores of Bharat Where a man of all races have come together...
