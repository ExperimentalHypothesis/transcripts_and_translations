[After the performance of artists]

Shri Mataji: It was really very interesting to go through various programs coming from different countries. I myself was overwhelmed that Sahaja yoga is spreading to all these countries.Where they have created such good artists ...& such a good program. We didn't even feel that how the time passed. Lastly the critic, of course, I always say don't criticise others but especially the art when people start criticising, the art is dying out and is now only the critics are criticising is a fact.If not, the art that will come up will be so tedious and [unclear /haze], that we can never enjoy that art because it will be only for money, a cheap type which can be sold in the market. And this kind of intellectual analysis of everything is responsible also to the decline of your art. We are doing it all the time. We all think that we are very intelligent, and we can criticise, all the time correcting these artists is a common thing.It's not only artists but in any field of life we have taken very much arrogant and we think we know everything and we can criticise others.By which we stop their progress completely. Not only that, But we also stop our progress. Because whatever you do with your mind is not in any way global, in any way spiritual.So this mind has to be left alone and you have to go beyond the mind.So many of these artists have done work through their torsion area! I can see that. Because they are so much spiritually developed that they can do this kind of work. But when we start criticising them, because people are not at all anywhere near the torsion area...And they don't understand the beauty of the torsion area, they start criticising. By that, they are bringing down their level of high-class art ...Artists are of course very much [unclear].But also other areas where we are, we think it from the point of you of only money. And ultimately you find that even that point or that aim fails because after all, even money which is the Lakshmi Principle has to have the art.If you don't have the art of money, you are absolutely a useless fellow and I hear of so many people, today they are earning so much and tomorrow they are just become bankrupt. How is it happening? What is the problem is that you don't understand the art of money also! Everything is an art in a way Life also is an art ... that is you have to make everything look very beautiful, very sensible, balanced and energy-giving ...Here now I have saw some very nice paintings behind, of Shri Ganesha done so perfectly well, in every angle, in every way...And it is so joy-giving to see such a nice painting. Instead of taking the joy out of that people start putting into words...In the words, they get lost and we can never see the beauty and the poetry behind that play. Same about poetry, same about literature, same about all those things which are poured out of your heart ...As I said even the money if it has no heart behind it its a horrible stuff and you just can't bear to see such money ...It's so ugly.You can't bear it! So in everything that you do, there has to be your heart ...Without the heart whatever is done has no meaning. You just from your mental capacity go on criticising everyone, go on saying things about everyone But how much do you enjoy ! how much do you get inside you !  is only possible through your heart ...Which must be opened, Which must be great,& which must be enjoying. So for all of us Sahaj yogis, It's quite an eye-opener When we see it.Because I have seen, even in Sahaja yoga people are very critical of each other sometimes. Saying that you should not have done this, you should not have done that ...It's not your lookout.You do it properly & others will also do it.There is no ritualism, in Sahaja yoga. One thing one should know, there is no blind ritualism. But all rituals are so-called are there...are from the heart. If your heart is open, you will do all the rituals in a very sweet manner...and I would say result oriented...Otherwise whatever you do with such a mental tension and thinking what are you doing wrong or right you can never achieve any ascent with that. I am very very happy, very much satisfied and I don't know what to say, I am enamoured ...You see so many people from so many countries are Sahaja yogis ...And such good artists and such beautiful people ...I didn't know Sahaja Yoga would be everywhere so fragrant that to see all this, you don't know how joyous I felt.Compared to my efforts ...it is too much, really. And like a little seed becomes beautiful flowers I see all of you coming up here and showing this talent. Not only your talent but the talent of Sahaja. May God bless you all with all my heart ...I bless you ...
