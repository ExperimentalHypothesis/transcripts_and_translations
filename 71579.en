Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

[Beginning is missing] ... heart attack when you become guilty. You all the time feel guilty, and depressed, or also you go to fake gurus and take wrong mantras also, this center gets caught up. So the heart has to pump the blood to the brain and it cannot because of this blockage. So, it goes on pumping, pumping and the enlargement of the heart takes place and - or else, it develops into an angina. And sometimes it can be very much more pressurized and one can get a so-called heart attack, this is angina attack and they die.

Now those people who are, who think they are very cunning, and playing around with others, their hearts are not clean. They also get the heat in their heart and can collapse with heart attack. To make the thing little shorter, I think I should explain to you about one very important centre. Because if you know about that center, most of the diseases you will understand.

Actually, this is the second centre which we call as Swadhisthan. And it comes out of the third center, and it moves on all the sides. Sometimes it can expand, it can contract but in the whole of that area, it moves [green area]. On the physical side, it looks after the aortic plexus. But we must understand the subtle side of it. Now the work of this centre is, the most important is to transform fat into grey cells for the use of the brain. Now when you think too much, you are very calculating, you think all the time. Then what happens, that by thinking you use the grey cells that are replaced by this centre, which creates grey cells for the use of the brain.

But also this center has to look after the liver, the pancreas, the kidneys and the spleen. So, when you start thinking too much, all functions of supplying energy to these organs minimize. As a result, you get bad liver. It is liver which emits heat in the body. This heat can also trouble your lungs, because so much heat is coming out in the body, so you might develop asthma with it. On top of that, if you take alcohol, you spoil the liver much more.

Then you have got another one which you have to look after is the pancreas. When pancreas is neglected, you develop a disease called diabetes. Now imagine in India, in the villages, people take sugar so much that the spoon has to stand in - I’m sorry, I’ve been speaking for the whole month, now my throat is off. All right. - It has to stand in the sugar. So much sugar they take! But they do not get diabetes, because they do not think, they are villagers. They get up in the morning, work in their field, come back home, nicely have a family life and sleep on it. So, they don't get diabetes at all. But in the city, where the big planners are sitting, planning the whole world, themselves are unplanned.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

Then you have got very important organ called as spleen. The spleen is the speedometer. It builds up our rhythm, rhythm of life. If the rhythm of the life is not kept all right, then spleen goes off, it becomes crazy. The reason is the rhythm of life is giving you proper idea as to when to produce more ‘RBCs’ that is red blood corpuscles for emergency.
Translator: Hum. That’s medical, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Red blood cells.
Translator: Ah, red blood.
Shri Mataji: Red blood corpuscles. [Unclear]
Now when we are under the mix [involved], all the time giving shock to this spleen, then what happens when we are giving all the time shock? Like in the morning, we use the newspaper. What do you find? So many people killed. Imagine this poor spleen must produce more red blood corpuscles.
Then you start for your office or work and in the road there’s jam, as it was [unclear]. [Shri Mataji is laughing]

So, somehow or other, your take your breakfast in the car, you are biting, getting angry with everyone for creating a jam. And you are one of them.
[Laughter]
The poor spleen doesn't know how to cope with your madness. And shock after shock! Because you go to the office, and the boss starts shouting at you, "Why are you late?" He doesn't understand ‘jam’. Moreover you have seen the watch all the time, you in more trouble. You’d better not see the watch. We have got watches to save time for meditation, not for getting worried about nonsensical things.

So, to be all the time under shock, keeps that spleen crazy all the time, he doesn't know how to react. So this spleen goes crazy. Now it is vulnerable for a blood cancer, ‘leukaemia’ as you call it. Now, here you are just vulnerable, and then you get a big shock somewhere, emotional, then you are in for it. Then the doctors will tell you only that, "Certified that will die after one month. Please arrange".
[Laughter]
You are certified. Now, Sahaja Yoga has cured so many blood cancers, so many. By giving a speed and rhythm to the personality.

Now, formerly in India, we had an institution, I mean even now, of a housewife, and we call her the Goddess of the house. And she was regarded as the one who was keeping the rhythm of the house. And she had to be a very forbearing, and a peaceful person. In India, the woman would cook the food and the man would eat and she would be sitting with a fan rhythmically moving. So the man eats his food at peace.
[Laughter]
So she formed the rhythm for the man. But these days, the women themselves are working, they themselves are crazy.
[Laughter]
And there is no peace in their heart. A woman has to be like this Mother Earth, she can bear anything. Because the man can only lose temper on the women at the house: how can they lose temper outside, they will be beaten up if they lose temper. They will be beaten up for that. So, like, they should be treated like children, they come home: shout, shout, finished! Then they are all right. They don't mean it.
[Laughter]
So, the good relationship is established and the man finds his peace with his wife. So when this center moves to the left, we call it the center of Gruha Lakshmi, means the Goddess of the house, of the home.

Then also it looks after your kidney. So when the kidney is not looked after, it goes out of function and you start developing kidney troubles and you end up in a hospital taking all kinds of help from the machinery. But there is a very easy method to cure all these things. When you will be coming to our course, they will tell you how to cure your liver, how to cure your pancreas, how to cure your spleen and how to cure your kidneys. And the kidney when it is spoiled [unsure], you get high blood pressure.

Now I think we have covered lots of diseases, and we will know about all of them later on. So we should have some other subject now, it would be a good idea.

In Sahaja Yoga, nobody gets cancer. Nobody gets high blood pressure. Nobody gets blood cancer or anything, but they are very balanced.
[Someone speaks in the audience. Laughter]

All right, we have some big questions here already. You write it down please.
[The seeker in the audience asks his question]
Such big questions!
[Laughter in the audience]
Sahaja Yogi: He wants to know [inaudible].
Shri Mataji: Cancer comes out of worrying. If you worry too much you get cancer. Now once this –
[A lady from the audience speaks loudly]
Sahaja Yogi: She wants to know what to do now.
Shri Mataji: Now. Now you just meditate, you will be all right. We'll tell you what is to be done in the course, how to meditate. Because now you have opened out like a chimney here, the fontanel bone area and the worry goes out of it.
Now a thought rises and falls off. Another thought rises and falls off. We live on the cusp of the thought which comes from, either from the past or from the future. And what happens, we are jumping on the cusp. But when the Kundalini rises, in between the thoughts, there is a little space, which is called as ‘Vilamba’, and this space is the present. So once you meditate you come to that space where you become silent, the thought stops. Worry you cannot do because thought. And when you want to think you can think, when you don't want to think, you will not think.
[A lady from the audience speaks loudly in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: According to me, madam, according to me, most of these are just sicknesses. It's a personal sickness, most of it. Now when you come to the program, they will tell you how to get all of them cured and how to work it out. It's very simple method. So all of these which are above the sicknesses, will be judge [unsure] later on.
[To the seeker]: One by one.
Now – One, one, just one person. Now who is there? That gentleman. Please.

[A lady asks a question in Spanish]
Sahaja Yogi: She asks, why should we do the meditation towards the photograph [unclear]? We could, we thought a very inferior feeling that we have the meditation, that we could do anywhere without being with the photograph.
Shri Mataji: Oh. Then I have to confess something that my photograph has got vibrations, luckily, it's very nice. 24:08
As I have got, from Me you got it, in the same way, my photograph has got. It has a coefficient. If you don't use My photograph, you won't get in the beginning, then you can give up. First you have to use the photograph, because I don't see any other photograph have got [vibrations] because so far, no saints have been photographed, right? There's no photograph. Rama: there's no photograph. Krishna: there's no photograph. I am sorry but supposing we use your photograph, it won't help. I wish it could be, but it's not possible. I wish somebody’s photograph do that, but it doesn’t not act. That's why I have to do it.

Then also every human being has a kind of a vibration, every human being. Now supposing somebody is sick, and I cannot meet that person, if you bring [the photo of] that person to Me I can feel the vibrations of that person on the photograph only. And I can say what's wrong with that person is, and it can be helped also only on the photograph. Photograph is a very big thing in modern times.
Moreover, because there were no photographies, people have made of horrid faces of Christ even. And I am sometimes so angry the way they have made these photographs. Oly a Realised souls like Michael Angelo could get somewhere near his body and his feature. And the Sistine Chapel is made, covered with the Kundalin only, the whole thing and showing the same thing, the Last Judgement, when you are judged. And below that is a table where a Christ, looking like a PD patient with all his bones, is put there, like a beggar. Can a skeleton like that carry such a big cross?

But there are many miraculous photos also of mine, which we'll show you later, not just now, but we'll show you how miraculous certain photographs have come.

[A man asks a question in Spanish]
Sahaja Yogi: He says his question has nothing to do with sickness, Mother. I think this question comes quite often, Mother. Is it the awakening of Kundalini has nothing to do with sex or does it have to do with sex?
Shri Mataji: No, nothing to do. It has nothing to do with sex. See now, here, the sex is the lower chakra. This is, you see the seventh center or the first center is below the Kundalini [Shri Mataji shows the chart]. On the contrary, when the Kundalini is rising, this center which gives- is all for your excretion, stops completely. It's called as pelvic plexus [unclear]. All your things stop at the time when it is rising, at the time we are meditating. This is the center of your innocence. So your innocence is awakened at that time.

[A man asks a question in Spanish]
Sahaja Yogi: What is the relationship between the food we take and our own evolution and the Kundalini?
Shri Mataji: You see, human being has either the left side or the right side or he is in the center. Say, somebody is a right-sided person. He should take more to carbohydrate. It's very scientific. If somebody is left-sided, then he has to take more of proteins. And if he is in the center, then he has not to eat anything which grows under the Mother Earth. Like that, it's very scientific. And you are not to mix carbohydrates with proteins. But whatever you eat, you can meditate. [Shri Mataji is laughing]
But if you develop some imbalance, then you have to look after the food part.

[Unclear conversation]

[A man speaks for a long time]
[A lady speaks in English, unclear]
Shri Mataji: You should ask very short questions, you see. There is no time for discussion.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: So, I think we should stop now this questioning. That's a very good thing.

Sahaja Yogi: He was only resuming, Shri Mataji, that you were saying that Christ is in the center, and that we are living in a time, it’s like the time of Apocalypse. And that something will come and he’s frightened [unclear].
Shri Mataji: No, he said that, "I will send you the Holy Ghost". Now questions and talks have stopped. All right.

Now what I would suggest, that you come to this course. By talking you cannot [unclear]. In Sanskrit, it's called ‘Shabda Jaalam’. It's a web of words. And Kabir Das, a great poet has said, "Padhi, padhi pandit murkha bhaye". By reading too much also, the intelligent have become stupid. So, it is something that has to be experienced and you have to become. And that is what is a difficult task.
[To the lady] Ask no more, all right? No more. No, because you see, I have stopped others.
Sahaja Yogi: She just wants to know when is the course.
Shri Mataji: When is the course? That's a good idea.
[Conversation in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Loudly, loudly.
[Another Sahaja Yogi gives the address of the sahaj centre and says it is free.]

Shri Mataji: How much can you pay? [Shri Mataji is laughing]. It’s very surprising. We too say in Marathi language, ‘pagar’.
No, only in Marathi language.
Sahaja Yogi: Pagar, what does it mean?
Shri Mataji: Pagar means [unclear].
[Many reactions]
Shri Mataji: Nothing is to be paid, nothing.

[A lady asks a question in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: What does she say?
Sahaja Yogi: She wants to know how are we going to meditate.
Shri Mataji: That's what I am going to tell you, madam. Nobody is allowing. There are at least twenty people raising their hands still.
[Many reactions]

Sahaja Yogi: No, they don't want to ask. They want Realization.
Shri Mataji: Very sensible people, I must say. All right.
[Many reactions]
Sahaja Yogi: They are fed up of questions.
Shri Mataji: All right. Aren't you going to have your lunch also? I am worried, as a mother. I am worried you must have your lunch [unclear]. Let's have that experience again.

Sahaja Yogi: They can answer?
Shri Mataji: Later. Have patience. Have patience. Please tell the person. They will not [unclear] again.
[Many reactions]
All right, doesn’t matter. We are not going to answer any questions. So don't raise your hand. [Applause]

Now again, we'll do the same as we did yesterday to establish ourselves. It takes about ten minutes.

[REALISATION PROCESS STARTS]
Please take off your shoes.

As you know we have to put both the feet away from each other. And those who are sitting on the ground need not bother, but they should take out their shoes. Now we'll show you again what is to be done, because there seems to be some new people, and then we’ll close our eyes and we'll work it out.
So, now you have to be comfortable, first of all.
And you need not sit with any bend or anything, just straight like this. But not too much strain on your body at all. You don't have to fight with your thoughts. You don't have to fight; they’ll stop by themselves.

It just works. Now the left side is the power of desire. So, please put your left hand towards Me. And the right hand is the one which goes into action. So, we are going to use the right hand for the action on the left-hand side onto different centres. First, I will show you.

But before anything else start, there are two conditions I told you yesterday. The first one is that you are not to feel guilty at all about anything. Whatever you have done, don't feel guilty. Now believe Me in that: you are not guilty at all. Not at all guilty! You are human beings, so how can you be guilty? The second is that you have to forgive everyone. And again I say that it is a myth that we forgive or if we do not forgive. Because we don't do anything. But if we do not forgive we play into wrong hands. Yesterday, so many came who could not feel the cool breeze. And when I told them to forgive, they started feeling it. We are not going to miss this phase now by just not forgiving someone. It is such a useless phase, mythical. Nothing is more important than yourself getting Realization.

All right. So now you just sit straight like this. Put left hand towards Me. First, you will have to put your right hand on your heart. I would request all of you should forget your questions for the time being. You first get the light. In the heart, resides the Spirit.
Then you put your hand in the upper part of your abdomen. On the left-hand side. Then you put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. On the left-hand side. Then you raise your hand again in the upper part of your abdomen. Then you raise your hand on your heart. Then you raise your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. This is the center which catches when we feel guilty.
Now you take your hand on your forehead, across, bend your head. This is the center of forgiveness. Now take back your hand onto the back side of your head, and push back your head on it to rest. Now stretch your hand and put the center of your palm onto the soft bone which was there in your childhood, called the fontanel bone area and press it hard. Now press it hard, push back your fingers. And now move your scalp very slowly, clockwise, seven times. Please bend your head, it is easier then.

Now, this is what you have to do, you can take out your spectacles and you have to close your eyes. Many people did not press it hard and push their fingers back.

Now please close your eyes. Now put your left hand towards Me, and right hand on the heart. In the heart resides the Spirit. So, please ask Me a question three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Whatever you like, you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. Please say it three times.

Now take down your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the center of your mastery. If you are the Spirit, you are your master also, you are your guide. So here you have to ask a question, "Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times, please.

Now take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to ask for pure knowledge, which is going to manifest through your nerves, through your central nervous system, and you will know the Absolute. But I cannot force it on you. You have to ask for it. So please ask, "Mother, give me pure knowledge". Say six times, because this center has got six petals. As soon as you say this, ask for pure knowledge, your Kundalini starts moving.

So, we have to clear the upper centres with our self-confidence. So now raise your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side, and press it hard. Here now with full confidence, you have to say twelve [ten] times, "Mother, I am my own master. Mother, I am my own guru". Say ten times. Those who had wrong gurus also get corrected with this.

Now you have to know something very important about yourself. That you are not this body, you are not this intelligence, you are not this mind, you are not this ego, you are not emotions, and you are not your conditioning, but you are pure Spirit. So now raise your hand to your heart and don't open your eyes till I tell you. Now here you have to say with full confidence twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

We have to know that Divine is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of bliss and joy. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. And you cannot commit any mistake that cannot be corrected by this great ocean of forgiveness.

So now raise your hand into the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your right hand, put your head towards your right hand- right side. Here now you have to say with full confidence, remembering that you are now entering into the Divine which is the ocean of forgiveness. You have to say with full confidence sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty at all".

Now please raise your hand to your forehead, and please put it across and put down your head and press it on both the sides. Now here you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone". Say it from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone". So you get freedom. Say it from your heart, not how many times.

Now take back your hand on the back side of your head, and push back your head, completely resting on that hand. Here you have to ask for forgiveness, without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, for your own satisfaction. So, you have to say, "O Divine, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes". Now this is to be said from the heart, not how many times.
Now, stretch your hand and put the center of your palm on top of your head, and bend your head. Keep your hand towards Me, your left hand. Push back your fingers, press your scalp and move it slowly, seven times clockwise.

I have to just tell you that I cannot again disregard your freedom of choice. So you have to say in your freedom and glory that you want your Realization. So you have to say seven times, "Mother, please give me my Realization". Press it hard.
[To the Sahaja Yogi]: Not working.
[At 1:02:08, Shri Mataji blows into the mike]

Now, please take down your hands. Now put them both towards Me. Now, bend your head and put your hand on the fontanel bone area, not on above. And see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out, right hand towards Me. Bend your head so that you can feel it.
Now, you put the left hand towards Me. And bend your head and see with the right hand if there is a cool breeze coming out. Now, please, put your right hand now, right please. And see with the left hand, if there is a cool breeze coming out.

Now, take your both the hands up like this, and stretch back and see upward. Here ask Me questions. "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the All-pervading Power of God's love?"
"Mother, is this the Brahma Chaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions, three times.

Now, bring down your hands please. You watch Me now [unclear] the silence [unclear].
When the Kundalini passes this center, then you become ‘nirvichara’, means thoughtless awareness.
Those who have felt the cool breeze out of their head or in their hands, please raise both your hands, even hot it’s all right.
All of you?
May God bless you, all of you.
[Applause]

[Unclear] Now do not waste your Realisation [unsure]. It has to be a permanent experience. [Unclear] Like Christ has said that, "Don’t spread seeds on the rocks". Some [unclear] of land like Colombia. But afterwards- [applause]
You are responsible to spread God’s love. [Unsure]
May God bless you.
