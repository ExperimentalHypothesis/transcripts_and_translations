[Beginning is missing] ... heart attack when you become guilty. You all the time feel guilty, and depressed, or also you go to fake gurus and take wrong mantras also, this center gets caught up. So the heart has to pump the blood to the brain and it cannot because of this blockage. So, it goes on pumping, pumping and the enlargement of the heart takes place and - or else, it develops into an angina. And sometimes it can be very much more pressurized and one can get a so-called heart attack, this is angina attack and they die.

Now those people who are, who think they are very cunning, and playing around with others, their hearts are not clean. They also get the heat in their heart and can collapse with heart attack. To make the thing little shorter, I think I should explain to you about one very important centre. Because if you know about that center, most of the diseases you will understand.

Actually, this is the second centre which we call as Swadhisthan. And it comes out of the third center, and it moves on all the sides. Sometimes it can expand, it can contract but in the whole of that area, it moves [green area]. On the physical side, it looks after the aortic plexus. But we must understand the subtle side of it. Now the work of this centre is, the most important is to transform fat into grey cells for the use of the brain. Now when you think too much, you are very calculating, you think all the time. Then what happens, that by thinking you use the grey cells that are replaced by this centre, which creates grey cells for the use of the brain.

But also this center has to look after the liver, the pancreas, the kidneys and the spleen. So, when you start thinking too much, all functions of supplying energy to these organs minimize. As a result, you get bad liver. It is liver which emits heat in the body. This heat can also trouble your lungs, because so much heat is coming out in the body, so you might develop asthma with it. On top of that, if you take alcohol, you spoil the liver much more.

Then you have got another one which you have to look after is the pancreas. When pancreas is neglected, you develop a disease called diabetes. Now imagine in India, in the villages, people take sugar so much that the spoon has to stand in - I’m sorry, I’ve been speaking for the whole month, now my throat is off. All right. - It has to stand in the sugar. So much sugar they take! But they do not get diabetes, because they do not think, they are villagers. They get up in the morning, work in their field, come back home, nicely have a family life and sleep on it. So, they don't get diabetes at all. But in the city, where the big planners are sitting, planning the whole world, themselves are unplanned.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

Then you have got very important organ called as spleen. The spleen is the speedometer. It builds up our rhythm, rhythm of life. If the rhythm of the life is not kept all right, then spleen goes off, it becomes crazy. The reason is the rhythm of life is giving you proper idea as to when to produce more ‘RBCs’ that is red blood corpuscles for emergency.
Translator: Hum. That’s medical, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Red blood cells.
Translator: Ah, red blood.
Shri Mataji: Red blood corpuscles. [Unclear]
Now when we are under the mix [involved], all the time giving shock to this spleen, then what happens when we are giving all the time shock? Like in the morning, we use the newspaper. What do you find? So many people killed. Imagine this poor spleen must produce more red blood corpuscles.
Then you start for your office or work and in the road there’s jam, as it was [unclear]. [Shri Mataji is laughing]

So, somehow or other, your take your breakfast in the car, you are biting, getting angry with everyone for creating a jam. And you are one of them.
[Laughter]
The poor spleen doesn't know how to cope with your madness. And shock after shock! Because you go to the office, and the boss starts shouting at you, "Why are you late?" He doesn't understand ‘jam’. Moreover you have seen the watch all the time, you in more trouble. You’d better not see the watch. We have got watches to save time for meditation, not for getting worried about nonsensical things.

So, to be all the time under shock, keeps that spleen crazy all the time, he doesn't know how to react. So this spleen goes crazy. Now it is vulnerable for a blood cancer, ‘leukaemia’ as you call it. Now, here you are just vulnerable, and then you get a big shock somewhere, emotional, then you are in for it. Then the doctors will tell you only that, "Certified that will die after one month. Please arrange".
[Laughter]
You are certified. Now, Sahaja Yoga has cured so many blood cancers, so many. By giving a speed and rhythm to the personality.

Now, formerly in India, we had an institution, I mean even now, of a housewife, and we call her the Goddess of the house. And she was regarded as the one who was keeping the rhythm of the house. And she had to be a very forbearing, and a peaceful person. In India, the woman would cook the food and the man would eat and she would be sitting with a fan rhythmically moving. So the man eats his food at peace.
[Laughter]
So she formed the rhythm for the man. But these days, the women themselves are working, they themselves are crazy.
[Laughter]
And there is no peace in their heart. A woman has to be like this Mother Earth, she can bear anything. Because the man can only lose temper on the women at the house: how can they lose temper outside, they will be beaten up if they lose temper. They will be beaten up for that. So, like, they should be treated like children, they come home: shout, shout, finished! Then they are all right. They don't mean it.
[Laughter]
So, the good relationship is established and the man finds his peace with his wife. So when this center moves to the left, we call it the center of Gruha Lakshmi, means the Goddess of the house, of the home.

Then also it looks after your kidney. So when the kidney is not looked after, it goes out of function and you start developing kidney troubles and you end up in a hospital taking all kinds of help from the machinery. But there is a very easy method to cure all these things. When you will be coming to our course, they will tell you how to cure your liver, how to cure your pancreas, how to cure your spleen and how to cure your kidneys. And the kidney when it is spoiled [unsure], you get high blood pressure.

Now I think we have covered lots of diseases, and we will know about all of them later on. So we should have some other subject now, it would be a good idea.

In Sahaja Yoga, nobody gets cancer. Nobody gets high blood pressure. Nobody gets blood cancer or anything, but they are very balanced.
[Someone speaks in the audience. Laughter]

All right, we have some big questions here already. You write it down please.
[The seeker in the audience asks his question]
Such big questions!
[Laughter in the audience]
Sahaja Yogi: He wants to know [inaudible].
Shri Mataji: Cancer comes out of worrying. If you worry too much you get cancer. Now once this –
[A lady from the audience speaks loudly]
Sahaja Yogi: She wants to know what to do now.
Shri Mataji: Now. Now you just meditate, you will be all right. We'll tell you what is to be done in the course, how to meditate. Because now you have opened out like a chimney here, the fontanel bone area and the worry goes out of it.
Now a thought rises and falls off. Another thought rises and falls off. We live on the cusp of the thought which comes from, either from the past or from the future. And what happens, we are jumping on the cusp. But when the Kundalini rises, in between the thoughts, there is a little space, which is called as ‘Vilamba’, and this space is the present. So once you meditate you come to that space where you become silent, the thought stops. Worry you cannot do because thought. And when you want to think you can think, when you don't want to think, you will not think.
[A lady from the audience speaks loudly]
Shri Mataji: According to me, madam, according to me, most of these are just sicknesses. It's a personal sickness, most of it. Now when you come to the program, they will tell you how to get all of them cured and how to work it out. It's very simple method. So all of these which are above the sicknesses, will be judge [unsure] later on.
[To the seeker]: One by one.
Now – One, one, just one person. Now who is there? That gentleman. Please.

[A lady asks a question]
Sahaja Yogi: She asks, why should we do the meditation towards the photograph [unclear]? We could, we thought a very inferior feeling that we have the meditation, that we could do anywhere without being with the photograph.
Shri Mataji: Oh. Then I have to confess something that my photograph has got vibrations, luckily, it's very nice. 24:08
As I have got, from Me you got it, in the same way, my photograph has got. It has a coefficient. If you don't use My photograph, you won't get in the beginning, then you can give up. First you have to use the photograph, because I don't see any other photograph have got [vibrations] because so far, no saints have been photographed, right? There's no photograph. Rama: there's no photograph. Krishna: there's no photograph. I am sorry but supposing we use your photograph, it won't help. I wish it could be, but it's not possible. I wish somebody’s photograph do that, but it doesn’t not act. That's why I have to do it.

Then also every human being has a kind of a vibration, every human being. Now supposing somebody is sick, and I cannot meet that person, if you bring [the photo of] that person to Me I can feel the vibrations of that person on the photograph only. And I can say what's wrong with that person is, and it can be helped also only on the photograph. Photograph is a very big thing in modern times.
Moreover, because there were no photographies, people have made of horrid faces of Christ even. And I am sometimes so angry the way they have made these photographs. Oly a Realised souls like Michael Angelo could get somewhere near his body and his feature. And the Sistine Chapel is made, covered with the Kundalin only, the whole thing and showing the same thing, the Last Judgement, when you are judged. And below that is a table where a Christ, looking like a PD patient with all his bones, is put there, like a beggar. Can a skeleton like that carry such a big cross?
