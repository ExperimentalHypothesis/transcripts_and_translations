[Beginning is missing] ... heart attack when you become guilty. You all the time feel guilty, and depressed, or also you go to fake gurus and take wrong mantras also, this center gets caught up. So the heart has to pump the blood to the brain and it cannot because of this blockage. So, it goes on pumping, pumping and the enlargement of the heart takes place and - or else, it develops into an angina. And sometimes it can be very much more pressurized and one can get a so-called heart attack, this is angina attack and they die.

Now those people who are, who think they are very cunning, and playing around with others, their hearts are not clean. They also get the heat in their heart and can collapse with heart attack. To make the thing little shorter, I think I should explain to you about one very important centre. Because if you know about that center, most of the diseases you will understand.

Actually, this is the second centre which we call as Swadhisthan. And it comes out of the third center, and it moves on all the sides. Sometimes it can expand, it can contract but in the whole of that area, it moves [green area]. On the physical side, it looks after the aortic plexus. But we must understand the subtle side of it. Now the work of this centre is, the most important is to transform fat into grey cells for the use of the brain. Now when you think too much, you are very calculating, you think all the time. Then what happens, that by thinking you use the grey cells that are replaced by this centre, which creates grey cells for the use of the brain.

But also this center has to look after the liver, the pancreas, the kidneys and the spleen. So, when you start thinking too much, all functions of supplying energy to these organs minimize. As a result, you get bad liver. It is liver which emits heat in the body. This heat can also trouble your lungs, because so much heat is coming out in the body, so you might develop asthma with it. On top of that, if you take alcohol, you spoil the liver much more.

Then you have got another one which you have to look after is the pancreas. When pancreas is neglected, you develop a disease called diabetes. Now imagine in India, in the villages, people take sugar so much that the spoon has to stand in - I’m sorry, I’ve been speaking for the whole month, now my throat is off. All right. - It has to stand in the sugar. So much sugar they take! But they do not get diabetes, because they do not think, they are villagers. They get up in the morning, work in their field, come back home, nicely have a family life and sleep on it. So, they don't get diabetes at all.
