[Beginning is missing] ... heart attack when you become guilty. You all the time feel guilty, and depressed, or also you go to fake gurus and take wrong mantras also, this center gets caught up. So the heart has to pump the blood to the brain and it cannot because of this blockage. So, it goes on pumping, pumping and the enlargement of the heart takes place and - or else, it develops into an angina. And sometimes it can be very much more pressurized and one can get a so-called heart attack, this is angina attack and they die.

Now those people who are, who think they are very cunning, and playing around with others, their hearts are not clean. They also get the heat in their heart and can collapse with heart attack. To make the thing little shorter, I think I should explain to you about one very important centre. Because if you know about that center, most of the diseases you will understand.

Actually, this is the second centre which we call as Swadhisthan. And it comes out of the third center, and it moves on all the sides. Sometimes it can expand, it can contract but in the whole of that area, it moves [green area]. On the physical side, it looks after the aortic plexus. But we must understand the subtle side of it. Now the work of this centre is, the most important is to transform fat into grey cells for the use of the brain. Now when you think too much, you are very calculating, you think all the time. Then what happens, that by thinking you use the grey cells that are replaced by this centre, which creates grey cells for the use of the brain.

But also this center has to look after the liver, the pancreas, the kidneys and the spleen. So, when you start thinking too much, all functions of supplying energy to these organs minimize. As a result, you get bad liver. It is liver which emits heat in the body. This heat can also trouble your lungs, because so much heat is coming out in the body, so you might develop asthma with it. On top of that, if you take alcohol, you spoil the liver much more.

Then you have got another one which you have to look after is the pancreas. When pancreas is neglected, you develop a disease called diabetes. Now imagine in India, in the villages, people take sugar so much that the spoon has to stand in - I’m sorry, I’ve been speaking for the whole month, now my throat is off. All right. - It has to stand in the sugar. So much sugar they take! But they do not get diabetes, because they do not think, they are villagers. They get up in the morning, work in their field, come back home, nicely have a family life and sleep on it. So, they don't get diabetes at all. But in the city, where the big planners are sitting, planning the whole world, themselves are unplanned.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

Then you have got very important organ called as spleen. The spleen is the speedometer. It builds up our rhythm, rhythm of life. If the rhythm of the life is not kept all right, then spleen goes off, it becomes crazy. The reason is the rhythm of life is giving you proper idea as to when to produce more ‘RBCs’ that is red blood corpuscles for emergency.
Translator: Hum. That’s medical, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Red blood cells.
Translator: Ah, red blood.
Shri Mataji: Red blood corpuscles. [Unclear]
Now when we are under the mix [involved], all the time giving shock to this spleen, then what happens when we are giving all the time shock? Like in the morning, we use the newspaper. What do you find? So many people killed. Imagine this poor spleen must produce more red blood corpuscles.
Then you start for your office or work and in the road there’s jam, as it was [unclear]. [Shri Mataji is laughing]

So, somehow or other, your take your breakfast in the car, you are biting, getting angry with everyone for creating a jam. And you are one of them.
[Laughter]
The poor spleen doesn't know how to cope with your madness. And shock after shock! Because you go to the office, and the boss starts shouting at you, "Why are you late?" He doesn't understand ‘jam’. Moreover you have seen the watch all the time, you in more trouble. You’d better not see the watch. We have got watches to save time for meditation, not for getting worried about nonsensical things.

So, to be all the time under shock, keeps that spleen crazy all the time, he doesn't know how to react. So this spleen goes crazy. Now it is vulnerable for a blood cancer, ‘leukaemia’ as you call it. Now, here you are just vulnerable, and then you get a big shock somewhere, emotional, then you are in for it. Then the doctors will tell you only that, "Certified that will die after one month. Please arrange".
[Laughter]
You are certified. Now, Sahaja Yoga has cured so many blood cancers, so many. By giving a speed and rhythm to the personality.

Now, formerly in India, we had an institution, I mean even now, of a housewife, and we call her the Goddess of the house. And she was regarded as the one who was keeping the rhythm of the house. And she had to be a very forbearing, and a peaceful person. In India, the woman would cook the food and the man would eat and she would be sitting with a fan rhythmically moving. So the man eats his food at peace.
[Laughter]
So she formed the rhythm for the man. But these days, the women themselves are working, they themselves are crazy.
[Laughter]
And there is no peace in their heart. A woman has to be like this Mother Earth, she can bear anything. Because the man can only lose temper on the women at the house: how can they lose temper outside, they will be beaten up if they lose temper. They will be beaten up for that. So, like, they should be treated like children, they come home: shout, shout, finished! Then they are all right. They don't mean it.
[Laughter]
So, the good relationship is established and the man finds his peace with his wife. So when this center moves to the left, we call it the center of Gruha Lakshmi, means the Goddess of the house, of the home.

Then also it looks after your kidney. So when the kidney is not looked after, it goes out of function and you start developing kidney troubles and you end up in a hospital taking all kinds of help from the machinery. But there is a very easy method to cure all these things. When you will be coming to our course, they will tell you how to cure your liver, how to cure your pancreas, how to cure your spleen and how to cure your kidneys. And the kidney when it is spoiled [unsure], you get high blood pressure.

Now I think we have covered lots of diseases, and we will know about all of them later on. So we should have some other subject now, it would be a good idea.
