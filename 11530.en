we weren't sure what we wanted is being cancelled and so they have given us

approval now for next round.

Yogi :Hmm

HHSM :I think they take money

Yogi :Hmmm

HHSM :A very, very, very funny people.

PAUSE

HHSM :No custom has troubled me as they did, really. Nothing at all. Actually I did not know what was inside it l. I told them, I don’t know it’s for a Puja, we got it. This is how we got it, is that how we got it but still they got out. I said do whatever you like. If you want take it away and do whatever you like.

PAUSE

HHSM :You see one of them is so bad. Who is going to send anything there?

Yogi :It is getting worse.

HHSM :Worse. You see they sent me. They wanted some things from India but they have sent me all those things. 8 m 48s what you call ......(inaudible)  The main problem is that the economy has gone down so much that it is all a waste. I told him first, so even if they were starting some business I said stop it first, you don’t know what is going around. Thank God.

Yogi :That was, that was Robert, my brother.

HHSM :Robert

YOGI :Yeah, yeah

HHSM :That’s what I was saying.

Yogi :Yeah (muffled)

HHSM :That’s how Avinash is very ........(Hindi). Have to talk to him. ...(9m 30s) has no salt

Yogi :Murmuring (Inaudible) And in Europe Mother. In Europe and Russia

HHSM :Ah Russia. In Russia nobody would believe what happened. Nobody would really believe. I mean they have just accepted me as power of God. Just accepted. Really wise, really so deep. Maybe there always have been introspection in that sense. Writers, novels or anything. It always has been introspection. They are not like western people or like others who have the so called freedom who have the so called freedom, so much of attention is wasted but just the sum of it indeed just, now we have just six, we have 600 doctors who are practising Sahaja Yoga.

Yogi :Yeah

HHSM :Yeah, they are learning about, there are proper school-going about it and there are 200 scientists of higher-level the one who made Sputnik.

Yogi :Sputnik

HHSM :Absolutely there. See our ego is so much you are in the dungeon of darkness and ignorance.  And for any programme, it has to be a stadium, 14 000, 16 000, even in Bucharest, oh my God, you won’t believe how terrible it was. And you might be frightened how they might even break the hall.

Yogi :Really

HHSM :Unbelievable. And they do not have any small, small. They understand (in audible)

Yogi :That’s right

HHSM :You see We are,  the west, if we can pay for something, we will be very proud.

Yogi :See

HHSM :Now, say in America we have already have altogether only 100 Sahaja yogis. Only 100 throughout somehow or rather sticking out compared to Russia just 100 somehow or  rather sticking on but even when I went to say South America, tremendous, tremendous. No even in Sydney or any place you go even in New York you see I am there somehow or rather the hall is full. But real Sahaja Yogis (motorbike sound).  Russians don’t have a sort of emptiness from here. I mean they are very well off in a way. You see there is no poverty, no poverty. Everyone who gets married gets a house. Then cars are given, food is there now of course it is a little worse. They used to get everything, everything, I have seen that they don’t have to work so hard, no struggle, nothing, everything on me. No problem but now because of this change so also, also it had reached  that stage of scarcity that I think that they, they  had given up work no interest to do work, no interest they have no pay That is why it all settled down this way. So he had to change the method but for example the government offered them, you can have your houses we will not charge you anything, you can take your houses but you have to maintain them .I said ‘No’ you better take from us then you have it. (Laughs)

Yogi :Laughs

HHSM :Can you believe it?

Yogi :Here they take two houses.

HHSM :Huh, Here the thing is taxes. This, that, all kinds of problems.  Everything is looked after by the government, so they were very happy go lucky people and now suddenly they have to look after themselves they have to start their own. (motorbike sound...inaudible) 14m 25s.  Alright whatever it is we should say that it is a very great number of people waiting for us. Then the Bulgaria’ same thing and then last we went to Romania, before this Puja. That was another place absolutely tremendous people, tremendous. Very nice. In a way they were even deeper than uh.  Russians I would say. 

Yogi :Ah

HHSM :In a way, because they have more of bakhti, devotion but Russians are more sort of . they have sorted it out to that point. Mother is the saviour but these people are emotionally attached. It’s the question of who I am sure all this will be exposed very soon to the whole world. (inaudible) Already when we were going in the plane, we were going to Russia, Moscow and the plane we found a magazine with my full photograph it's all about my work everything given and some people interview was given, everything. I was so surprised in the magazine you know in the (Hindi) but some sort of a magazine it was.  All the magazines were 

Yogi :Business USSR

HHSM :Business USSR should start

Yogi :Really?

HHSM :Yeah and on the plane in English Language. You see that, then I was so surprised that everybody started coming to me “Give us realization, give us realization in the plane”. So that is how it has worked it out. So now are we all prepared for the programme?

Yogi :Yes, yes

HHSM :You have advertised?

Yogi :Yes, I will show you the advertisements. This is how we are printing

HHSM :Oh, very nice. I really found one of the advertisements for Kundalini, for tantra, for this. There was an advertisement

Yogis :Chattering

Everybody was complaining, “We want to sleep, we want to sleep” but no, so sleepy. I think I’ll have a bath and sleep for a while.
