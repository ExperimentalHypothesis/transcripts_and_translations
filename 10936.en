I bow to all the seekers of Truth. There is no such area/courtyard in life where man does not search. Sometimes he doesn't know what he is searching for. He doesn't know that there is something lost within him that he is searching for. Superficially no matter how much he may say, 'I am fine,' or 'I am satisfied.' But if he thinks from within, then there is some quest hidden within him which is calling him from every side. Sometimes he thinks that if I earn a lot of money then I will surely find contentment/solution And in his search of how to make money, he does wrong things. But I have never seen any rich person very happy, not till today. All those who come to Me say, "Mother, in every way there is discord in the house." "And I don't have any peace within me, please give me peace." Then someone thinks that, "My physical strength should increase so much that the world trembles before me."

And he keeps trying that, "I should make my body strong." "Even then I don't get peace." He also says, "Mother, give me peace." After that many people run towards power, work very hard 'I want this power, I want that power.' I have seen even people with great power that they have no peace. They also wonder where can this peace be found. In this way man is wandering here and there, running about in search of peace. But where is this peace? Which is that path through which this peace could be found whereby we can know the secret of this peace? If there is such an auspicious temple, then people roam around in temples, then go to some gurus and then get lost in books.

Whether they believe in God or not, but all the time they feel that there is no peace within. When man evolved from animal to human, then he lost his peace. Because animals are in the control (loop) of God, so there is no need for them to be disturbed but there are two such institutions inside a human being which do not allow him to relax. One of those institutions, which we can say, is ego. It is only man who thinks, 'I do this, I do that, I did this, I did that,' or 'I have to do this' or 'My forefathers did this.' 'What do I do next?' - he thinks ahead. Which other special thing I want to do - always thinking of the future. He is not at peace with what he has at present. You know it is said in Economics, in Economics, that the human wants are never completely satisfied.

You just see, today you bought this thing, after that bought another thing - will go through so much trouble for each thing and when they get that thing, is achieved, it becomes worthless. Then started running after another thing. When the other thing is got, then after getting it, forgot everything how difficult it was to get it, how much we desired for it, forgot everything and thought that it was useless, now do something else . In this way a person's mind wanders and starts running from one thing to another. And he starts thinking, 'Look, I have so many nice things.' Despite having everything, he does not have peace within him. Still, he remains restless. Some need one thing, some need another. Some need things, some people desire for a home, some people want children, then someone has a desire for power. He runs after it and finds that despite having all this, even though this whole ocean is in front of me, just like a bird remains thirsty in the ocean similarly, this ocean of the people does not have the power to quench my thirst.

On the other hand, another institution that has been formed within us, is that of sanskaras (values). The values ​​start getting settled. Someone says that from today onwards do Surya Namaskar (prayer to the Sun) every day. Now it's done that Surya Namaskar has to be done. Now Surya Namaskar was done today, was done tomorrow, was done the day after; done fifty times, then a hundred times; in the end got to know that he died of a heart attack. If someone tells us some ritual, then we go to the extremes. Despite having good values, there is no peace in man/person. Like I know there is a gentleman, he is a very honest man. He is so honest that he even points out his wife's mistakes in front of others. People call him honest, he is such an honest man.

But he does not have peace in his mind. Why is there no peace within you when you are on the path of honesty? And even then he will say, "See, I could have earned this much money,' 'But look, I'm honest, I didn't. I didn't collect any money.' I don't think it is a special thing for a person to be honest. Or there is a man who says, 'I speak the truth, I'm outspoken too, I speak the truth.' 'I speak the truth in every matter.' But still he does not have peace of mind. Only the values are present inside him. So these sanskaras of religion which are within us are from without.

From that, it's just this that we are pure people with pure conduct. But it's not empty yet, it's hollow. No moistness of peace has come in it yet. There is no coolness of peace. And most of the people who are overly honest, they are so aggressive and short-tempered - should always keep a distance of five feet from them. Never know when they will push you down because such people have too much anger in them. Because this sanskar (value) is also an imposed ornament, which becomes cumbersome, whose burden cannot be borne by man. Similarly that, we have children, we should take care of them, we should insure them, there should be property for them, this should be done for the wife. Thinking about many such things also, man can not attain his peace. I was once very surprised that in Maharashtra there was a very sober(grave) man, and he made a very nice project by making a very beautiful Varna Nagar.

Thousands of people got jobs in it and he made it absolutely such that it felt as if you have come to a big city of some Western country. Well-organized provisions were made for everyone, everything was done. So I thought I should meet this great man and he expressed a great desire that he wanted to meet Mother. When I reached there he grabbed My feet and started crying. Such an aged man - I said, "What's happening to you, why are you crying?" Started saying, "Please let me take out my pent up feelings; I have no peace of mind at all." I said, "Why?" He said, "This Varna Nagar that I have built, people think highly of it," "But I think I have ruined all the able people." There were people here who did not drink alcohol, so they have started drinking, business of bad women has started here, Here (UNCLEAR - Republic?) has started, drugs have started here.

Such things are happening here that You won't believe. And above all, there are all kinds of horrible atrocities and extreme violence here, I don't know why. I was very surprised at this. He said, "Mother, I did all the work with good intentions in my heart to develop this village." "With a lot of hard work and desire, I brought it to such heights of progress. I built so many schools in it," "built colleges, what all I did and in the end what is the outcome," "that such corrupt/vicious people that when I see them in the morning, I feel like that why should I taint myself?" Will drink alcohol the whole night. Will take small children with them and they all will drink. So whatever good deeds he did, whatever work he did, that too went to waste. Still there is no peace among the people.

When there was no freedom in our country, Gandhiji used to say, 'First let freedom come, then You can start Sahaja Yoga.' Until You are not free, how will You start Sahaja Yoga? All right, I said, let freedom come. That freedom came. Many people surrendered their selves, sacrificed, freedom came after doing a great deal. But now when I look at people, I wonder where have these cunning mafia-like people come from after independence. I don't understand. The people of that time who were fighting, who went to prison, those who faced so many problems, who are these people who have come instead of them? It seems as if these demons have come and sat in the place of the gods and goddesses of Heaven. How much the society has changed!

Is this why we got independence? People say a lot of things. Recently the people of Bangladesh told Me that, "We fought so much Mother that we want Bangladesh, want Bangladesh, want Bangladesh. What did we get from the independence of Bangladesh?" So many people died in Bangladesh and how much poverty has come in Bangladesh that this poverty is never going to go away. This will keep on increasing, our poverty will keep on increasing day by day. Similar is the condition of the Pakistanis too. And if by any means you think that through this fighting, this trouble and sacrifice, and even if by talking big you achieve something, you will still feel that you have not achieved anything. Condition will be the same. Like if you buy a car, then you feel what car, should buy a house now.

Bought a house, then will feel, what is it of the house, my sister is not married yet. In this way only, all the great things that happened in the world and the great battles for freedom were fought, did this, did that - but today, no matter which country you go to, man has become so distracted that can't understand that after fighting so many battles, after becoming so talented, after making so much progress, on what brink is man standing today? Don't know when he will be destroyed, when he will be ruined. A lot of people who are sitting that (UNCLEAR), don't know how we're going to be finished, but despite all this, man's quest is towards peace. When there is a search in that too, many associations are formed. Groups in the name of this, groups in the name of that. Recently I heard that in the demand for peace (UNCLEAR). I have seen such people also who have received Nobel Prize for Peace but are so short-tempered and so full of anger that there are ten thousands of wrinkles on their face. And as soon as we see them we feel, 'Oh my God, who is this messenger of death?' and they have got the Nobel Prize for Peace.

From which angle did they look at the person and gave the Nobel Prize? And upon asking the people that, 'Oh, are they coming here tomorrow?' 'Oh my God, just don't ask anything. Her tongue is like a sword?' And such anger that she dances from here to there, from there to here, when her temper rises. And has got Nobel Prize for Peace. This world is also a strange drama. This alchemy of Kaliyug, all this was going to happen in this Kaliyug. This has indeed happened. But along with this a very great blessing has come from God due to which we (UNCLEAR).

In which this All-Pervading Power of God's love has now taken pity on man, on his stupidity, that I gave him freedom to find his freedom find the Truth, search for God, then don't know what all swirls he is carrying and what condition he has made of himself. Why did it happen like this? Perhaps it is the Power of Love of the compassionate God, He felt compassion and in that compassion, His form has changed in the KritaYuga. Today Sahaja Yoga is taking full advantage of that KritaYuga. The advent of KritaYuga and its manifestation is a great blessing for us. Anyone who does not take advantage of this (opportunity) at this time, will indeed be very unfortunate. There is no one as unblessed/miserable as the one who cannot fully achieve the blessings of this God. But in Kaliyug, we have even lost faith in God. We think that God does not exist, and even if He exists, He must be sitting somewhere. People do not understand anything, they are looking towards God in delusion.

And in order to understand this, KritaYuga has come for you to achieve Self-realisation. In Self-realisation you reach to that abode which is the source of peace. The peace of peace. From where peace flows, from where the stream flows out, and whenever desired, then also there is peace. Such a person is not only calm himself, but wherever he goes, there peace resides. Suddenly the person starts wondering that who has come and stood there. Early in the morning it seems that who is this statue of peace who has come and stood there. It was as if peace had started flowing from within and whatever restlessness I had felt has vanished. Where did all that restlessness that came from our ego and our mind disappear? And in this salty water, in this salty water of the sea, from where has a beautiful pond of Peace formed.

How has this peace surged within us and has calmed us down. And now it seems that all things are swaying in peace. The speed of peace has come. We think of peace as something like ice that neither melts nor spreads. Our opinion is this only, a person whom we call a peaceful person, he neither speaks nor moves; remains seated at his place. The peace of a Sahaja Yogi is like ice but the ice flows and whomsoever it touches, it calms them down, it gives them comfort. The alchemy to achieve this peace is completely created within you by God. Has been very beautifully made, with a lot of love. As if an artist is sitting in a very peaceful place and drawing a beautiful picture. In this way God has created this beautiful creation within you.

You don't even know and the peace that He has filled in that creation, it creates peace in all our chakras at the time of Kundalini awakening. This is the power of our Kundalini passing through the seven chakras. And when it passes through each energy centre, then each energy centre has a peace of its own, its lake that is, it makes it absolutely calm. As if there's a lake in which there is absolutely no disturbance, it's a calm lake. The beauty spread around that lake is completely reflected in it and gives joy. Similarly, how in such a person does the lake of peace get established in every chakra. All the beauty, all the tenderness, all the love, all the joy that is spread around it, is reflected, but such a person's life blossoms. Many people think that how can Kundalini be awakened easily like this. At least in our country many people know about Kundalini Many do not even know, they are very ignorant. But they cannot believe this that the Kundalini which rises through great, difficult penance, how does it rise so easily?

Our chakras are not yet clean, our lives are also not clean But the KritaYuga has already begun; Its blessings which you have received thus that KritaYuga has brought this environment/state today, that the Kundalini within us is suddenly, at once awakened. And due to this blessing only, today thousands of people in the world are realizing their Spirits and are attaining that peace which is the nature of that Spirit. Unless peace comes within a person, he cannot think of anything, can't work out anything in a smooth manner and even after doing it, the satisfaction is not achieved. The satisfaction is also not something so concrete that you have found the satisfaction. Meaning, any such thing you got in your hands. This is also a leaning of the attention, the form of that instinct is different, that has changed. Just understand, that the instinct/disposition which was running all around, has been absorbed/settled within you. Those instincts, those tendencies, all of those tendencies have come into this life. So I said that, 'Now I am sitting in contentment.' With pure attention I am just seeing.'

But what is reflecting within you after finding this contentment? Complete peace. So the peace of this peace is the Kundalini. It resides within you and it/She is your Mother, extremely peaceful. She is very calm and knows everything about you. Just as is a tape record, in the same way this peace has known everything about you, that how is this son of Mine. She is the Mother within you, your individual Mother. Now She is sitting peacefully. Many people say that She is in a dormant state, waiting for an opportunity that some authorized person comes and helps Me progress in My rising up/upliftment. Not only this, that It should take care of My son and impart all this knowledge to him.

And when She rises up, then knowing what the path is like, where all to stop on My son's way, which of his chakras are caught up, how to pass through them, so that he does not face any problem, he does not have any uneasiness. And very carefully/cautiously, cherishingly, this Kundalini of peace rises and after rising up, imagine that It pierces your bone. It pierces the bone of the head and you don't even realize it. And if you just look at your chakras, especially your Sahastrara, then it will appear as if nice, beautiful lights of seven different colors are moving, absolutely calm, oscillating, shaking. Slowly they are blooming, slowly they are closing. Absolutely calm. Only fire rises above leaving the element of earth. Similarly, Kundalini also, gravity which is the element of earth, It crosses it and rises up. But the element of fire which burns and gives heat, that same fire seems to be absolutely calm. So these petals also, which are of your elements, in the same way it seems, that the kindled flames of these lamps burning here, are absolutely calm.

A strange sight is seen and then we know that it is something extraordinary. Kundalini is neither as fiery as fire nor does it give us shocks like electricity, and it doesn't either carry us away like water. But what it does is that by going into every chakra it achieves such a state of peace that every chakra is flushed with that peace, is nourished by it. And in that peace its work gets greatly balanced. Say, if you're taking a tree onto a ship, or you're carrying a small plant, and you notice the ship is shaking a lot, in some time you will see that the plant will die. Similarly if something is very restless, there are a lot of problems in any house, children cannot prosper there. Nothing can prosper in unrest and see its beautiful form. So first of all the function of Kundalini is to calm down all the chakras first. And calmness comes, tranquility comes in the human being, which is complete security, when he knows that I'm completely safe. That knowledge is not through the intellect, but it becomes a part of one's nature and he is safe, then why worry?

Sitting comfortably. Similarly, this special state comes on all the chakras. And these chakras become absolutely calm. You can't achieve peace with anything. Many people said that, "Mother, we do a lot of worship," "Okay," “But we are not peaceful. We go to temples, we are not peaceful.” "We read books, we are not peaceful. We sing many hymns, we are not peaceful." "It provides some entertainment and mind is distracted for a while, but are not peaceful." The nature of this peace comes from Kundalini. Kundalini is present in the Mooladhara chakra within us, which is made up of the earth element.

But Mooladhara is the symbol of your dharma(sustenance) and from there it takes all Its strength which is peace-loving, and when it rises then you wonder what it was, whatever was making me unstable, which were bothering me, don't know where those thoughts have gone. So the first thing, when it comes to the Agnya, it silences the Agnya. As soon as you calm down, it takes you beyond the Agnya. After that when it comes into your brain, it calms that down as well. Nowadays this disease of tension has become very common. The reason for this is that there is no peace in the brain. Now you can take its injections, drink alcohol, do anything. There is a brief forgetfulness, after that the situation becomes even worse. That tension has returned again. Because the peace-giving power is the Kundalini inside you.

Man cannot attain peace by doing anything unless his Kundalini is awakened. Therefore it is extremely important for the Kundalini to be awakened. And as no work can be done in a disturbed place. There is a fear in man all the time. If someone says that there is rioting going on in Ghaziabad, then no one will sit here. If someone says that there is going to be an earthquake here, then no one will listen. But someone says that everyone there is listening very peacefully and everyone is sitting quietly, then in this way a new order of human beings is known, knowledge is obtained, in which everyone is sitting peacefully, everyone is listening peacefully, everyone is singing peacefully, and there is nothing that is causing any dispute or trouble to anyone. In that peace, no words ever come out of the mouth which would cause pain to others, trouble others, hurt others. His hands cannot do any such work which will hit or kill others because hands have become peaceful. There is a very peaceful atmosphere in the house of such a person.

The plants and trees in such houses are very big. If you keep flowers in the room of such a person, even the plucked flowers turn bigger and fragrance starts coming out of them. There are many miracles of this peace. You can especially see its miracle on all living things. As, a gentleman who is a big scientist in Austria was told that we have a [UNCLEAR - CORNER?] in which the trees are dying, make arrangements to save them. So he, used vibrations which are peaceful, created his experiment by taking the vibrated water. Surprisingly, all the trees that were dying survived, but the very old trees died. And all of them became so white that people say that such trees are no longer seen in India. You will come to know from a distance only that this is a Sahaja Yogi's farm.

Because the wheat from a Sahaja Yogi's field is big, shiny and has a great taste. And the biggest thing is that they were made from non-hybrid seeds, ordinary seeds were used to make them. This area of yours, the area of Meerut, I have known for many years. You must have heard that all the land of Oonche Gaon - My husband was the collector here and I used to visit Ghaziabad as well. They said that, "Collector Sahab it is important that farming be done here." So My husband said, "Okay see, this land lying here is very old." That is land from before 1857 and the British had also built graves there for their dogs. There were lots of graves of horses, of dogs, (UNCLEAR) and the houses there were very big. So I said, "Okay, the work of Shakambhari should be done here." Because Shakambhari Devi manifests Herself here [UNCLEAR - Athena?].

And I said, okay, I will do it. So I started farming. And I said that (UNCLEAR) gave vibrated water to all. First soaked them for a while and then sowed them. And you'll be surprised the tomatoes produced were so very big. The tomatoes produced were so big and so crisp. So people came from Bombay. They said, 'Let us take these with us.' And the brinjals grew so big. Some of them weighed almost three quarters of a kilo each brinjal, so much so that was difficult to lift them.

And wheat grew so much that it was a record. They started saying that, 'This cannot happen anywhere. How did someone grow wheat in their house?' And the cucumber spread so much, I told him, "Distribute it as much as you can." I had kept a buffalo there, it would sometimes give 18 seers of milk. What to do now, who will drink 18 kilos of milk in the house? Nobody could understand what had happened. Cabbage so big. Everything there grew so very big that couldn't understand. There was a Commissioner sahab, he was I.G.

of police there. Both of them used to come in the morning during their walk. Used to say, "It's alright that the vegetables grown are very good at Your place and we take the vegetables as well," but the special thing is that there is peace at Your place. So the poor fellows used to come and keep sitting on the stairs in the morning. When We woke up, they were sitting outside. "O, why didn't you people take chairs?" They said, "We forgot to take chairs etc, we just came and sat down." Every morning while taking a walk they would come and sit there. After that, they would uproot vegetables and take them. You'll be surprised that in agriculture too, in farming as well, there is so much impact of this peace.

After that, daily quarrels between husband and wife in the house. Any movie you watch nowadays, you will see a fight between husband and wife, watch any television, a fight between husband and wife. Especially abroad, there's nothing apart from those disputes. There is no other drama, just a fight between husband and wife. But after Sahaja Yoga, such peace comes within you that many homes have been settled down. You know so many international marriages take place in Sahaja Yoga - 50, 75, 80 and hardly one or two of them are unsuccessful, the rest are such pure marriages. Their children are so beautiful, children of so pure conduct. And the children who were earlier so bad at studies, used to talk about all sorts of useless things and answer back, they too became so beautiful and calm. The whole community of Sahaja Yoga is so peaceful, so good, so ideal, that whoever sees is amazed. Says, "I have never seen such a society.

What kind of world is this?" I said this is that pure world and this is the Khalistan we are creating, about which Nanak Saheb has said that create Khalistan. First become pure, if you are not pure, how will you create Khalistan? Pakistan was created - become irreproachable(pure) then create Pakistan. Created Pakistan without being pure - what was the benefit of that? Doesn't happen by giving big-big names. It is something that has to happen from within. If the work is not done as per the name you have kept, then should think why it is not being done. Apart from fighting, who else is doing what? Apart from fighting, criticizing each other, dragging each other, harassing each other, but in this how we should also respect each other and should also think about how to calm others.

Sometimes I am greatly astonished that very simple, ordinary people - a man was driving a bullock cart in which I was sitting. He started talking, so I said, 'Kabir has come down, this is Kabir speaking.' So I said, "What has happened to you, where did you learn this from?" So started saying, "Mother, how can I say this? This is my Kundalini speaking." "I have not learnt anything." An illiterate man, but he reached from where to where. And see, all those who became saints and sages, did they go to any university, go to college, got a degree, got some titles - nothing. Very simple, common people - Mohammed Saheb did not know any book. How did he do such amazing things?

How did he do all this? Entered into the peace, that very source of peace which opened. Have to embrace the power of this peace. Still, it may be, that sometimes peace is elusive. Still there is no peace within Sahaja yogis, that still peace (UNCLEAR). But it is just that as if everything you have, such a big asset, some property, and you are sitting hungry. Luckily for once, try to earn something, try to look within yourself. It seems as if everything has some reason in life, then this very peace starts flowing in a blissful manner. Hope today you people will get your Kundalini awakened completely The thing is that some of you have come here for the first time today, and few old Sahaja Yogis are also sitting here. There are many people to tell you about Kundalini and books are there too.

You (should) see that, you should understand what that Kundalini is. But by understanding It, knowing It, reading It, there is only one test, that I am the one who should attain this peace, how much peaceful have I become within myself. When you will understand this and do your investigation accordingly, then you will see that in reality this is some special thing. The fire inside me subsided, as if some peace is sprinkled within me, and the moon which is the source of that peace, there is no difference in it. Seems as if the heat of the sun is over. Everything at once became calm. My infinite blessings to all of you and May you [UNCLEAR – All achieve?] this peace today. If you all want to go out for a while, then you may, for five minutes. After that we will do a Self-realization program in which ten minutes.

Being born in this land of Yoga, one is born due to some great former good deeds. And that's why the work of Self realisation is done here very easily. A day will come when the whole world will come to you to know what this hidden/invisible power is, It has to be achieved from within, and how to be one with it. I am grand, huge/enormous, I see it every day, it is now in your hands, understand your importance here, understand your greatness, understand your responsibilities, and flourish fully in Sahaja Yoga. You are the one who made the whole world (UNCLEAR - transparent?) Thus understand that the land on which you are sitting, it's great principle, and the land nourished by the incarnations of many sages and saints, which did many important works in the name of dharma, that holy land has today in reality that power, that it will give you Self-realisation in a simple manner. No need to do any hard work. People who are sitting on chairs just need to take off their shoes And both the legs have to be kept separately. The rest who are sitting on the ground are fine. Now place both your hands towards Me in this way as if you are asking for something.

With pure feelings, keep purity in mind. Place both hands towards Me. Now extend your right hand towards Me and bend your head and see your (UNCLEAR - fontanel bone area?) with your hand, moving your hand a little away and see whether you feel any cool breeze coming from your head? Sometimes hot air also comes out. Pay attention, and see if cool or hot air is coming? Don't doubt yourself. Forgetting that we are big, if nothing else, we keep a big, or we are very bad or we have committed these sins - forget all these things. Please forget this thing, there is no such thing, because you are a human being And it is only human beings who make mistakes. God will not make mistakes.

Now the second thing is that you should forgive everyone all together. Forgive everyone all together. Whether you forgive or don't forgive you do nothing. But when you don't, you people definitely trouble yourselves. Now look, you have forgiven everyone, a cool breeze is coming. You fully.... This is the Kundalini that has pierced your Brahmarandhra, pierced your fontanel bone area. The cool breeze which is blowing from your head is the power of peace I was talking about. Now put your left hand towards Me and bend your head again Check with your right hand to see if there is any coolness is coming from your head or not? Is there any cool breeze coming or not?

Just see Some people get it till quite a distance from their heads, some get it close by But you don't have to touch the head, just hold it above. There is total calmness inside; peace has been established. Now put your right hand towards Me and your left hand, bend your left hand again above your head Bend your head, bend your head, bend your head to that [UNCLEAR - SHRI?] And now look. Is the cool breeze coming or not? I am getting a cool breeze from you people. Don't consider yourself guilty in any way. Don't put yourself down. Now you are going to the kingdom of God, so you have to reach there joyfully, happily, slowly, respectfully. He is the ocean of peace, He is the lake of peace.

He will come along within you like a lotus flower. Now raise both your hands towards the sky and look at Me without any thoughts. There is no need to think and with your head tilted back, ask a question three times in your mind, “Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya? Mother, is this the same power of peace?” “Mother, is this,” one may also ask that, “Shri Mataji, is this the All-Pervading Power of God’s love?” "Is this the Spiritual power?" Whatever you want ask the question three times with your head raised up. There is a strong wind blowing. Put your hands down. Put these down one by one. Oh Baba! This is not Ghaziabad, this has become Shanti Bagh.

All of you have got your realization. Most of the people have got their realization. My greetings to all of you!
