It's a small hall ...
Alright!
[unclear 01:47 ]Give them Chinese food ...
Sahaja Yogi: yes Shri Mataji !
Shri Mataji: No I don't want anything ...
Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji! This is your book Which you have written.
Shri Mataji: My book!
Sahaja Yogi: [unclear02:03 ]
Shri Mataji: All this Sada shiv ...[02:06 ].It is more based on Zen System. You must have seen it. Its the zen's idea about how a person who is a zen should do? It's very ...
unclear [02:38 ]...
You do the translation I am saying...
Han...
Children's can come here ...
They are born realized ...No problem at all 03:55
Alright! come forward here...
Now ...
Can you give your fan...
You have so many children with us here ...
Ya,...
Now the responsibilities were shown Because the other day When we had a program I don't know how many people were there but they said 200 have signed for the courses ...
So now your responsibility is much more...Because I have always seen New people when they come to see the people who are there already. They see how you behave with each other ...And also they see how you behave with them. So, when you are representing Sahaja yoga they should get a very good idea about you ...Isn't it?
That is the best way we can spread Sahaja yoga ...
See I see people they have respect for me, they love me everything ...But when they come to Sahaja yoga some or other they get upset and they run away. So we can form groups Like this is a person who will have a Chinese and you get some new groups ...200 is a big number ...
And others also like there are English or Americans, or Australians [07:12 unclear], for that also you could have a division for them, the people with whom they can not talk ...But It should be just for them the information that they need ...Normally there should be a way ...some tapes ...Some good tapes of mine are better. I don't know how many tapes there are Which are been translated or there are very few in Chinese So you have to get some more tapes ...translated you see with tape ...When you are recording one sentence is said and then you put Chinese Like that ...So that there would be more tapes added...All of you can try those who need...
But many people say in France & Italy all these places where they don't know the English language they said they learnt it by listening to my tapes ...I don't know how ...
So that which is important to see how you can do that? For that, you could have a tape and I wanted some people to sing song also but I think there is no preparation for that... But I think you people can sing one or two songs And talk to them. If they want to have any special information or explanation Then you should talk to them but directly you should not try to teach or anything It's very dangerous to yourself. Means you should not attack them by anything like some of them might come not properly dressed, you see...some of them come maybe little [unclear 09:58 ] possible. Some of them might be possessed. Then you should not say you have Bhoot, You are possessed, little things. As they are, accept them ...
Be kind to them and gentle to them, the best way. Some of them will be sick people also, who might be suffering from some trouble. So you can just say about vibrations Whether left-sided or right-sided & you can say alright We can give you vibrations or something ...If you will come to your house or something ... But I don't think you should immediately say that I am Adi Shakti and all that...They will get frightened ...
But you should say that If she can give realisation to so many people there must be something about it... Then gradually you will find some of them will really come up very well.11:37 But if you neglect others, We have to work more on them ... You see how you handle them is the most important thing, then never argue with each other when you are facing them. You should support each other...
Also never argue with them ... Then said that by arguing you will never get because it is beyond the mind...You should not waste your energy by arguing with them. Also in the beginning, if you might saw them coming from Gurus or something So not necessary at that moment you talk about his Guru on the first stage. Later on, they themselves gradually will discover...But in general, you can say that we don't take any money, and in Sahaja yoga, a mother doesn't need any money from you or this thing. That might open their eyes.
I am just telling you because this is the experience of Sahaja yoga for all these years. How they come to the program and they just disappear...
For example -I am a foreigner, And apart from that, I am an Indian...Indians are always... the people are always suspecting them ...But they believe in me ...in my photographs in my posters and I am very surprised ...So if you show that you are very humble and kind and nice...They will be very happy ...
Another experience, of mine in the Sahaja yoga -One person starts believing that he is a maha yogi. First, he becomes very pushy sort of thing, you know pushes ...then he dominates ... and then he starts talking all nonsense ... There is one fellow for example who started giving vibrations through his feet. Started saying I am shiva, the another said I am Adi shakti ...So I said better to give away my [unclear15:43 ]...They just stood off their ego and talked nonsense, absolutely It is unbelievable,the way they talk ...One fellow boxed somebody's head here like this ...I asked him why did he do it? He said ya I did it...
I asked him why did he do it? He said because he had a very [unclear /16:22 airway ] Agnya. He had! But nobody has the right to hit anyone or do anything ... It is a Sahaja Yoga, can only be achieved by ones own determination, once own dedication and absolute humbleness ...
There is a kind of an ambition that they have become very powerful now ...and this and that. With all these problems which we have faced from the very beginning of Sahaja yoga till today, I feel the real seekers just come out as themselves ...
Some of them will say that I have a special relationship with mother. And they talk as if they are very close to me ... But to be very frank, nobody can be close to me ... I am a very lonely person. :)
So all these funny ideas, the people start talking, then the newcomers just turn away ...They say what's wrong ...
With other false Guru's is... there is so many one gurus there are no so many Sahaj yogis or anything who knows anything about the knowledge ...false knowledge ...
So they stick to one guru ...who might mesmerize them also ...But they don't listen to anybody else because anybody else is just like them.
But we have ...Myself ...the Sahaja yogis...We have Sahaja yogis and among Sahaja yogis, we have people who are much deep in Sahaja yoga We have felt this ...And we are selling nothing you see ...It's not a market here ...So the attitude should be that we should be very humble and very compassionate, talk in a sweet manner ...
This will give you the best advantage ...To be considerate ...When somebody tells you something you should listen to that person ...Of course, if you find the vibrations are very bad, then you just make an excuse that alright I will just come and see somebody else ...
Handling of Sahaj yogis is very important ...Handling them!
They are just for their realization ...And They are just wondering what's going on?
So you have to prove that there is something built-in with you ...
Now supposing I mean ...I went to [21:26 unclear /place name ], nobody knew anything about me ...just I took my posters, and when I went inside I was surprised there were so many waiting outside ...I never expected because nobody knew anything about me!
[unclear 22:11 ]/........we are waiting outside...
So the outside people who were about near 2000 they said what about us mother!
So I went inside, ad told them I am coming back very soon & we will work it out...
And you will be amazed when I finished the program, gave realization when I came out, then still all of them were there ...and they felt cold also... I said alright you all come tomorrow morning we will have it outside because there was a huge big garden,[unclear23:15 ]
And they sat on the ground ...It's very surprising. Then I gave them a realization. And all of them were seekers. They were very much good people!
Now we have around 16-17 thousands of people who are good Sahaja yogis ...
24:12 If you will come to Russia you will be amazed how these Russians, I have never expected ...have taken to Sahaja yoga. I have more hopes for china much more ...
Firstly I know your Prime minister very well. Secondly, Chinese culture is very Sahaja. Culture...Not the one they have adopted .....But their fundamental culture is very Sahaja. And if I could here sometime entering I am sure we can get over china very soon, very fast ... But it is in your faces it should look that you are Sahaja yogis! You should be smiling and laughing & enjoying life. But if you are very serious and think tht whole world is collapsing then how can you spread Sahaja yoga?
So Our own style is very important, and this laughter is very spontaneous I think. 26:14
So eastern .....We can know much faster ...
Let us see now how it works out ..I am sure I will get reports about how it's progressing here. In the beginning, there had some problems because some people were not so much in Sahaja and they tried to hamper the progress of Sahaja yoga and all kinds of conditionings work out sometimes racialism, sometimes this religion or something is there ...Some sort of obstruction is there. But luckily now you are here, Alex here with me for quite some time,here John and all these people have come away from Australia28:00 and Austalia is doing so well now I can't believe.28:06 We have had very some bad experiences of the leaders of Australia but suddenly it's just like opened up. We can't believe it today Australian state [28:37 unclear ]. That is the same hope I have about Chinese and about Hongkong,about china mainland.
Anything you need about Sahaja yoga-like book,(about Sahaja books )as you have got now anything, anything that you want, tapes, audiotapes, videotapes, anything you should tell us. If you tell us in Cabella, you should write to Greedo and contact him because he is the one who gives universally...Anything that you want you can say with [unclear 29:29 /Greedo] ...And I think you can pay some money for this thing, audio, video something that much of [unclear29:39 ] but I think better is to have them with you. And you can listen to it in the car, and listen to it at home whenever they have a chance they go on this thing ...And that's how they have improved. And surprisingly they have learnt the English language, that Spanish people, Portuguese and also french, Swiss then we have Italians, and we have Australians, and they speak the german language and then Germany itself all these ...And that is how I think you can learn the English language because I can't learn so many languages. Especially Chinese, I can not say I can learn ... And even in Chinese, you have [unclear 31:05 ]. Impossible...I can not learn ...If you learn Chinese then you have already done your "Tapasya". So this is what it is ...I request you to be very patient, be kind, love finding each other, don't fight with each other, don't argue with each other, maybe little artificial doesn't matter. Because We have to spread Sahaja And for that little bit you have to compromise ...Also, this is ...... these modern clothes some people wear, extremely over modern, expose their and all that ...that sort of thing will not work out ...Like the American culture is spreading everywhere ...Even the language! I have told you America is already the worst for Sahaja Yoga ...Because they can not be Sahaja ...But that 2-4 Sahaja yogi's have changed We have now 1000's Sahaja Yogis!
The other day those 3 people who were sitting there all the time disturbing ...And there was Rani who was sitting there,(Rajiv's wife ) She said they were so stupid that when you said now you forgive everyone so this another fellow who was sitting next to her said OMG(oh my God ) now what we have to do like this horrible ...
Their attitude is very arrogant.
And If they are like that What you can do is just to see that, not to discourage them not say something but you can be kind to them, but be indifferent after some time if they are like that.
Now Taiwan is also doing well ... And this one American Chinese Who is coming to help him there and Austrians have taken lots of interest in Taiwan ...
What language they speak in Taiwan? (Mandarin one Sahaj yogi answered)
This is not in Mandarin.
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji the basic language is the same.
Shri Mataji: So why not ...Have they got the book ...
Sahaja yogi: We have sent it already.
Shri Mataji: Alright! :)
So it's very nice ...This is a very good building but you could translate some other course also ... Like there is a book very nice written by[35:25 unclear] Phase of God. But he English language is not so good in that so I thought [unclear 35:31 ] but you can write it because that's a nice book with all my vibrations but it should be given that kind of a book only for Sahaj yogi ...this is also personal book .., We have a small book which is for the people who are coming for the first time for not yet grown ...Gradually then even they grow to give them books...
If you have any questions you can ask me ...
Sahaja yogi: The Chinese eat too much fish, and have to improve there eyesight how can they improve the poor eyesight?

Shri Mataji: They should reduce you see...They can eat somethings which cools you down also common say - Like with the curd In India we take it with curd or with ...So it should neutralize a little bit ...fish.The style you had fish rather bits too much I should say ...
Because it is phosphorous and phosphorous works the liver. So you have to put ice on the liver...And fish should be eaten with rice or some carbohydrates... You see...So it is also nutritious ...with rice...
Raw fish is very dangerous ...
You can reduce it ...you see. Chinese food is so good. You need not have a fish ...you can eat so many things ...yes but more carbohydrates you should take ...your eyesight will improve ...You have to put ice here. You get the ice bags ...But if you put your hand left hand, right hand towards the photograph then you will find that your hands will start feeling the cold but not the liver ...So you should put in between the hand and the ice some sort of a cloth or a towel so that you don't feel. Then you can also take a kind of an ice pad on to your backside because here is the optic globe which cools down, also up to this point and the back...So the [unclear/40:58 "egang"] is the cross-section of the brain and if you are too much right sided then [unclear 41:08 ] goes very big ...
41:12
And the way they are placed, these balloons are placed also. If you have a cross-section you can see one balloon after the left side and right side both ...
And in the centre is Agnya Chakra ...But for children, you must change the diet ...It's very important...They should not be given so much fish ...So much ...When you are giving milk and all that you see ...It's also bad for the liver ...All your dairy products are bad for the liver ...And on the top fish also ...Coffee is very bad, tea is very well ...The coffee you drink quite a lot (Chinese )
No, No Chinese is good ...jasmine tea is very good ...It's quite light. Also, We have medicines in India which cool down the liver ...
Also, you can put kajal for the eyes ...If you think it's well made and authentic you can put it off on the children ...We can give you ...When you come for the...Let us know what you need.
Its a very easy thing is to cure the eyes, in the childhood but later on becomes difficult but still, at least they do not become lost ...Even in India, Bengali's... they eat a lot of fish So they too have bad eyes ...they too have weak eyes ...weak ...
So, this fish should not dominate us ...isn't it?
Worse are Japanese because they eat only Japanese food nothing but fish, fish, fish.
The skin of fish is also very dangerous,...And put rice in that ...the skin of fish...They don't waste even this much of fish left ... I am not against fish ... but is alright to eat the fish who eat too many carbohydrates...All eastern side of Asia people eats a lot of fish ...All because it's the seashore I think ...And the sea fish has much more phosphorous than the sweat water fish ...The ideal would be to balance it. Also, the rice that you eat dry is not good ...You must put some soup or something because dry /dryness you get out of phosphorous ...More liquid ,more fruits ...will clarify[46:12 ]it . It's not only diet but meditation also helps...
But if you are possessed or if you have some left-side problem then you have to use light at your backside. I mean if you have High Blood pressure, or you are hot-tempered, excited, overworking, that means you are right-sided...
And you may not feel vibrations on the right side or even if you feel it may be hot ...
Swadishtan catching very badly ...
And in especially Hongkong, it's such a busy place everybody is running like mad. The only way to get out of this is to get into meditation & go into thoughtless awareness. So without thought, you are alright ...You are watching everything ...So despite all these problems, you will be silent within and they will not affect ...These problems don't affect you. Also, there is too much pollution I must say ...For that, it's best to use something to cover your nose and the second one in Sahaja yoga we should say that ...Best way to avoid pollution is to take a Bandhan before leaving out ... And you can clarify it ...You take Bandhan so many things can be avoided because this pollution has an effect on the left side ...Bandhan is very important...Collective Bandhan is most effective ...for example, you can give Bandhan to Beijing, or collectively you can give it to China, all will work out because you have seen[unclear 49:32 ] ...
With meditation your tiredness, everything will go away ...
Especially right-sided meditation ...That is every night you must take a little water in a little bucket or something and put both the feet in it with salt not very hot water but cool water and put your right hand towards the photograph and left hand like this ...
And never use light or fire or sun ...Those people who are right-sided and sit on the sun get skin cancer...
We don't go with the fashion or craze or you say this entrepreneurs idea...We have our Sahaja Society ...and we have our own culture So we don't go on changing our dresses, everything according to fashion. Now the Chinese they put their hairs like this ... I like it but they should never touch the eyes. It's all right ...But if they are anyone near the eyes you get squinty eyes. Supposing a child has squint also you can put the light in the left side (at the back Agnya )
If it is in the left eye than on the right side (at the back)
And meditation is the best way for everyone ...To be without thoughts ...So you can do after cleansing before sleeping ...Put your attention to your Sahasrara ...
And in the morning you should do attention of thoughtless awareness ...Watch my photograph and don't think but your right hand should be like this and your left hand like this. Gradually it will settle ...Once you are thoughtless you can put your both hands (in the lap ) So this is how it is going to work out ...Your eyes, throat, ears, nose everything is the Vishuddhi chakra .../and your optic globe especially for the eyes ... so the best thing would be if you have the right side you see ...then you put these two fingers in the ear and put down your head and say Allah hu Akbar. Put down ...Because it is humbling down ...You have to humble down yourself...But if it is left side than you should put it like that ...and say Allah hu Akbar ...
No questions?
Sahaj yogi : [unclear]
Shri Mataji: You see ..this is the trouble with these people they will tell you all kinds of tricks only before sleeping you have to keep your attention towards the Sahasrara and surrender...But not at all the time in your Sahasrara...When your eyes are to be improved what you have to do is this what I have told ...But before sleeping every day if you can put your attention in your Sahasrara. These meditations (the other meditations ) have given no realization, has given no growth, no transformation...All just talking, talking, talk.
Now, I have some little presents for you... As many as possible as I don't know the number of people here...
(Sahaja Yogini asks some question )
Shri Mataji: It is the culture of the time. We are beyond time. Now take a Bandhan, if you are going out or something 58:13 Actually you are already in Bandhan but when you give a Bandhan you are thoughtless It should be brought into your conscious That's why you give bandhans ...So[ 58:31 /unclear]...
First I will take the present :)
What is this? {to the child sitting a side }Who has done this? you?
Beautiful (Mother appreciates the art shown by the children)
Thank you very much!
