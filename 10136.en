Our Understanding of Sahaja Yoga, London, 1978

Today if you ask me one or two questions it would be better and I will give you the answers because this is between us - those who have had the experience and those who are practically there, and there are very few new people here I see. But those who are at least acquainted with the vibrations and all that, should ask me questions to begin with, because then otherwise I will be tackling new persons questions.  Hmm.

Yogi: Mother you said in Caxton Hall that if a person doesn’t speak to their mother for a long time…can you elaborate on that theme again please.

You see, you are born from a Mother, alright? You are not born hanging from a tree, and neither you are thrown from the heavens and suddenly you are found born on this Earth. You are born from a mother in her womb. Her blood flows into you for nine months. You live upon her. You are a part and parcel of her being for nine months which is the most important time of your life. Now, she is there to give you first the sense of security. In a mother’s womb a child feels secured. If the mother is upset it has an effect on the child. If there’s something wrong with her then that is affected on the child - in the sense, physically also. It’s such a deep relationship exists between you and your mother that I’ll have to write a book to tell you how much it is deep.

But within us the power of Kundalini is the power of a Mother and not of a Father. The Father is the Witness as a Spirit and the Mother is the Kundalini and the Kundalini has to rise. Now it is the Mother in you that is the Kundalini and your own mother. It very much depends what kind of relationship you have with your own mother.

Supposing you do not know how to love your own mother, you can never love your mother country, you can never love it. That is the beginning, the training starts there only with your mother. If that point is lacking then you cannot have a full blooming of that love. Now maybe the mother has not been a very good mother also. There are according to sanskrit words there cannot be a bad mother kumata, but sometimes she could be bad also. So the idea of a bad mother is more brought forth by the intervention of law into mother child relationship. When mother is being punished by law for correcting her child or doing something [then] the artificiality starts. When people can sue their mothers. The responsibility of the law is not to disturb the natural relationships. If they start disturbing the natural relationship the artificiality starts and that’s why the countries where law has taken charge  of children and such things, without understanding the basic thing that it is a natural thing to love your child. Instead of that, if they had encouraged mothers who were more loving, more kind, if they had even had training for mothers [in] how to be more kind and gentle, if they had given more impetus to people to be good mothers. Instead of having beauty contests if they had good mother contests. If mother had been upheld  by the political and economic institutions then it would have been much better. But the whole society is turning to self-destruction so the law first takes over so the child is quite sure of itself. Now an eighteen year old boy in the family gets the dole then he thinks no  end of himself. He answers back to his mother, he talks in a very rude manner to the mother. It’s alright to say you have done it for an eighteen year old boy but you don’t know that he’s the eldest boy; the other children in  the family follow him.  So they pick it up when they are even very young. The idea of giving money to boys at that age also is extremely harmful because when he gets the money the other children think they must also get some money, so they start charging mother for the work that they are doing - you must pay 5p for bringing a glass of water for the mother.

Then the mothers now are of a different type. I mean there are so many mothers who say that, “It is not a thing that we should love our children, it’s not natural”! Artificial has become natural and natural has become artificial. How is it, within these [last] ten or fifteen years, suddenly the mothers have become so funny? Now, because of these pressures, what happens is that we develop a feeling against our mother, we start judging our mother and father. We should never judge them. We are not to judge them because we have chosen them they are there just as part and parcel of ourselves. Supposing your nose is broken do you start judging yourself, “My nose is broken, my nose is broken”? Do you discard your nose? In the same way your parents are. You cannot discard your parents! But the whole society is working like this, it’s a vicious circle.

Now if I say, “You go and talk to your mother,” then you can say, “My mother is not a good person. She is this and that.” Then I have to say, “Alright then forgive her.” Then you don’t like it. You would expect me to tell you, “Alright, just go and bash her.” You would be pleased if I told you like that, some of you would - “Go and beat her up”. But I would not say like that because that’s not the way Sahaja Yogis are going to work away. You must understand that the whole society is in a whirlwind, so somebody has to steady oneself and stop and try to change the winds. And that’s why a Sahaja Yogi has to stand up and understand that respect and reverence of parents is important. But it is an actual thing, because if you are not alright with your mother your left side is weak, you have seen it on the vibrations. Whatever I say you can see it on your vibrations. You will be the loser. Know that she has given you birth. Maybe if she has been harsh to you, angry with you or done something - forgive her.  And you will be amazed that you can win her over. It’s not difficult because by your goodness to her, by your over-goodness towards her, relatively it will work. And maybe exceptionally one person may be [not like] this thing but you cannot make a rule out of that; exceptionally one may be. But if you have to change the society, the whole thinking, somebody has to stand up.

And it is a chakra within you, you know, where it touches a point of void, where the left-side touches the point of void. That is a centre, a very important centre for a mother, which it makes. And do you know it is very near the centre of existence, because your existence depends on that. Supposing a child had no mother: he can never be a good husband, very difficult for him to be a good husband, because all the womanhood, all the kindness, the sublimity the greatness of women is known through your mother to begin with. Or a woman who does not have a mother - can never be a good wife or could not be a good mother herself. You see, all these things are there so we have to stop it and change it. This is the point Sahaja Yogis must know that we have to change and transform ourselves and that is the point [where] Sahaja Yogis feel bad. We are not only responsible for our change but we have to bring about the change in the whole world, where the society is getting destroyed, the human beings are getting destroyed so we have to stand up. So we have to change our way of thinking. What’s wrong in talking to your mother? She’s not going to kill you if you to her. Why don’t you talk to her? Because you need her. You want her to feel bad. I mean, you don’t go and hit your mother, this is the only way you can really be harsh to her is not to talk to her [so] she feels rejected by her own child whom she has created. God must be feeling that way also the way we reject him.

Everybody’s left side improves. But try to love and you will enjoy because loving is the greatest thing you know. To love someone, is adoration, absolute adoration, is reverence. If you love someone then you know that it is so great, it makes you so great to love someone. It’s a very great feeling that I love someone, it’s like a Lord one feels, “Oh I love this one and I love so many and so many are there!” And that person need not love me, I mean I don’t think all the Sahaja Yogis love me so much as I love them, maybe. But I’m very proud of my Sahaja Yogis and I love them.

This is the most joy-giving thing is to love, yourself. Able to love! That’s the greatest ability one should have is to love others. And in love, forgiveness is the most; that’s why Christ said [that] forgiveness is the greatest weapon. And what do you achieve by not talking? I mean, what do you achieve? Let us see the other side of it, what do we achieve by not talking to someone? Rationally. It’s a sweet method of course, if sometimes children do, “I am not talking to you,” you see. Then you can have a little play about that. But it should be just a play. If it is a serious stuff it’s nonsense. It’s just to play about [then] it’s very good that, “I’m not talking to you, I’m not going to talk to you for some time and you know that” But then it is not serious, it is just to bring out certain points and it’s nice that mother should come to you and cuddle you and persuade you and try to help you - that’s a good thing. But the way we are serious about it is something wrong.

Yogi: Can you tell us what the vibrations are.

Shri Mataji: Vibrations, as I said, that is the manifestation of the Spirit. But it is a very vague way of expressing it. Now see, there’s a nice flame before me. This candle has been enlightened. Now what does it do? It gives you light. But how does it give you light? By throwing light towards you, by emitting light. It is the emitting of pulsation from the Self. This light, this is light. Actually there is sound there is light. Very high frequency sound - very high frequency. Actually many types of sounds are mixed in. There’s is magnetism in this, in these vibrations. It has all the five elements -the subtle of all these five elements (tanmatras) inside these vibrations only. They are talking, they are telling you, they are guiding you, they are helping you. It’s because the Spirit is working through them. Like this light that you take in your hand: you go in the darkness, and you see that there is an impediment in between [and] you have to cross it. So you get the idea with this light. The light is doing that for you.

So, when the Spirit pulsates in your conscious mind, in your conscious mind, then it is a Self-realised personality. But in the unconscious it is there, all the time working. Actually the Spirit Itself comes out, it’s as big as your thumb is. But you can contain your thumb in your heart. That is the reflection of God Almighty within us because heart receives that image within itself, it is pulsating and is emitting the Knowledge through our unconscious. The Spirit is an unconscious being until we are realised. Once we are realised it becomes conscious, it starts emitting itself and pulsating. And what is Spirit? Is God Almighty Himself, in a miniature form, which is reflected within us, more between our heart which represents all the seven chakras within us. There are seven auras around our heart. All the seven chakras which are here in the Sahastrara, the seats are there, and all the seven chakras that are within us have seven auras around our heart and when all of them are clearcut absolutely clear, pure, integrated, then the complete emission starts, of those vibrations. They are much more than I can explain because, say, the other day, a lady was writing a letter to me and she was saying that, “Mother I am so sorry. I have my accommodation problem is at the climax…” and a very frustrating letter. And absolutely as if she was going to be doomed and all, the way she was writing it! I mean, such a trivial thing like that but she was very concerned because she didn’t know where to go. And first half of the letter was like that. Second half was like this that, “Mother, just now I received a letter from the authorities that they have allotted me a very beautiful place” in such and such place!! (laughing) Now, I would say this is all vibrations because it is all-pervading and you become one with the All-pervading Power so how it helps because when she was writing to me, the vibrations were feeling it, what she was writing from the paper, so they communicated to the All-pervading Power. And as the angels or you can say the Deities, also, can understand and they must have thought, “Why bother Mother with all this nonsense, better give her the letter as soon as possible, finish it off!” So in the second letter she says, “I’m such a fool to write this but I must write to you to give you the night and the day of my life.” So she wrote to me. So, it can work out that way.

So the vibrations are actually the things who are the doers and the enjoyers. They are the one who enjoy also if they find a very good realised soul coming then you just feel the Self-realised soul and you say, “Oh very good. Come along, come along. Just have it” Everybody starts enjoying that joy that is coming from that person. And that is what it is, that you start enjoying the beauty of that person through the vibrations. It’s a multi-dimensional thing, though it looks so simple, that you are feeling in the hand, that’s all. So it is a multi-dimensional thing just like the God Almighty. And for your information it is only He does everything. So only the vibrations work out everything, we really do not do anything whatsoever - [if we think we do] we are living in a fools paradise! For example, a tree dies and you chain it over and make a nice seat for me to sit down - so what? Tree is dead and you make a seat and you say, “Oh, we have built this, we have done that!” Nothing! What do you do? Can you sprout even a small, little seed? You cannot.

But these vibrations only, which connect you with the All-pervading Power, the All-pervading Almighty’s eyes, you can say - they are the ones who look after each and every minute thing in this whole world. Can you think of such a multi-dimensional thing? Now you have seen how vibrations work on people: how they dissolve even the thick bones and how they bring out the Kundalini here and how you see the softness on your head. Just you cannot explain how. Because they only do everything. They have the universal communication centres and they have the broadcasting stations, they have universal TV centres there. Everything is there. In short, you just copy them a little bit and you think you are doing something but you really don’t do anything whatsoever. That’s why it is said that Brahma - this is the expression of Brahma, these vibrations are the Brahma - is the only Truth. The rest is all is all a maya, is all an illusion. We live in illusions you see. He is the enjoyer, He is the doer, you are just in between to see Him. It would be like mic (microphone) thinking that he’s giving the lecture of Sahaja Yoga - it’s really like that!!

So to explain what is vibrations may not be so simple in all it’s details. But the overall idea I have given to you.

Yogi: I wanted to ask what is the function for the left-swadhishthana in all of us because it’s been catching all weekend.

Shri Mataji: Alright. I’ll ask ?? and then this. What’s that? Who asked me there?

New person: You were talking about the child’s relationship with their parents and you said that maybe you don’t like them, but that’s too bad, we have chosen them. What do you mean by that?

Shri Mataji: We have chosen our parents. Oh we have definitely chosen. I mean, most of you have, because mediocre people, those who are absolutely mediocre, just like very primitive souls. We should not say, ‘very primitive people’ but ‘primitive souls’ because there’s a difference between the two. A person may be, say the king you had here, he killed his seven wives, he was a very primitive soul. He might be a king but he was a very primitive soul. So the primitive souls they are not so much ?? as to who is there father or mother, and they also, sometimes, choose horribly primitive people as their parents, sometimes. So both the extremes choose - those who are very primitive and those who are very advanced always choose. And you being the seekers, you have also chosen your parents before taking your birth, through the All-pervading Power. So many of you have had parents because of you previous relationships with them. You might have seen that if we attach to some people like a mother, sometimes like a father, in this lifetime also you might be feeling that way. Because in India also the situation is a little funny but still in India it’s very common that you start feeling for somebody as if she is your mother you see. Yesterday I saw that Starkey of your BBC1 feeling for a lady, something like that. So imagine that Starkey, such a starkingly (sic) dry person having that kind of feeling for an old lady! So the reason is that he might have been connected with her in his previous lives and might have been his own mother, like that. So maybe you might have felt about someone like that in previous lives that, “Oh, I wish she was my mother.” Maybe she was the mother of your friend or someone and you thought that she was a very good mother, so you have that. You want that mother? Alright. Now when you see her you get frightened of her. So you will not ask that type, now you will ask for another type. So you have to go through many types, but better do one completely so that you don’t have to come back to the same. So better know about one completely by loving that person then you are finished with one type [and] you get another type.

Now, so coming to his problem of Swadhishthan, Left. Are you all having that ??.

(Yogis/new people respond. Barely audible)

Shri Mataji: I am happy you could see all that. Actually, Gregoire told me that, “Mother, if you come from the very first day then the attention will be on you and then we want to talk amongst ourselves about things. And there are some people who have not known much about Sahaja Yoga and we would like to discuss.” I said, “Good idea, you go ahead. I think it’s a good idea and you should do it.” “No, not exactly that Mother, this I can’t say!” But what I’m trying to say is that your intentions were good that you are going to see for yourself, meet everyone and all of you suggested that to me. I mean, somebody, everybody said that, “We would like to discuss among ourselves.”

Now, so there are children of different types. You said, “Let’s see now what happens.” But it’s a good idea, very good idea, because I would like you to mature like this and to understand, because this is a very good thing that has happened. Now, I will say why it is good. Alright? Because supposing you are all the time under my saree, hidden down here, you are never going to face these horrible things. And some of you, even today, do not believe that there are spirits (bhoots). It’s better to face it. Better to face it. Now there are also people who get possessed, also there, and they know what it is. But those who were never possessed do not believe in it. Actually they do believe because I am saying it, but actually inside they do not believe that there are spirits. So it was nice to face them here, first of all. Then secondly you are not to remain all the time under my saree. This is called as palla in Sanskrit language you see. So you have to face it. And it’s a very nice thing that has happened that you have been able to face it. Now you’re over that. Now any place you go to all the devils will run away from there! Not only that but nobody of this kind would be going to these places again.

So, that’s a very good thing that has happened. And, that you have taken it up upon yourselves. It’s a very big thing, I liked it. I really liked this thing: that you wanted to take it up and come down here and that you could feel it.

Now, I would say that none of you are harmed, none of you is harmed actually. Only thing you felt that because you are in collective consciousness you must feel the aim of your life, you must know. And also Left-Swadhishthana is caught by people who indulge in unauthorised ways of God. And so you recognise that, all of them who have been here have been unauthorised. Without any argument you know. So, that’s a training, and which you understand, first of all.

Secondly none of you are caught up now, just if you see, none of you have got anything of Swadhishthana left. You never catch actually. After all you are the instrument so you are the indicator. You just indicate. If you could just learn how to be a witness to that indication you would never feel [that] you catch.

Now, what you have felt catching is the Left-Vishuddhi actually: is that you are feeling guilty about it. That’s why where we panicked a little bit. (laughing) So if you say one thing, the other thing comes up. What was there to be panicked? So the Left-Vishuddhi is catching! That’s why! See the joy! Sahaja Yoga is such a joker I tell you.

Yogini: We thought - why were we here - last night!

Shri Mataji: You must have been blaming the place, you must have been saying that, “Oh, Why did we come to this place? We could have gone to some other place and worked it out. All these people have been here!” No, you have to work very hard. You have to go to much worse places than these are. You are soldiers and soldiers have to be on the battlefield.

Yogi: We won a few battles I think

Shri Mataji: You have won it! But you are not enjoying the victory because you are involved into it. Once you know, “Yes we had to win. We have won it,” then you enjoy it. But on the contrary now you are feeling, “Why did we panic?” So this is it - you never catch but the more you start thinking that, “We are catching,” then you really catch!

You are the Eternal Being. You are the one which cannot catch anything. You are the one which cannot be destroyed by anything. You are that,  so how can you be caught up? Only change your attitude about things, and then you will know that you are not caught up. It’s all a drama: Mother not coming in the beginning when she’s coming late. It’s all a drama, nicely done. I was very happy and I was happy also that Gregoire suggested it. Though I don’t know if he suggested it with the idea of becoming a big soldier but he did become! His idea was good, very good idea. And it was not his, but everybody was feeling, I could read your mind that you all wanted to go beforehand and talk to the new people and tell them about it and give them a little lecture about it because they have not known much about Sahaj Yog. They have been much more with the others and some have come for the first time - for them it is all Greek and Latin! So it was a good idea. It was a very good thing and this is very much related to what I am going to say to you today.

Is that a question [you want to ask] or taking out your badhas?

Yogi: Taking out.

(laughter)

Shri Mataji: No you are alright. That’s why you were responsible I think, so you were taking the responsibility too much and that’s why you were heated up. Now you are cool. Alright? You are not responsible for anything.

Yogi: At the last meeting at Caxton Hall I worked on someone and he was taking lots of drugs and this person kept recognising various people. He would say, “Oh yes I’ve seen that person before, I’ve seen that person before.” Now, do you think it’s because the person had been taking lots of drugs that they were going into the collective subconscious?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. You see he’s a drug man you can’t bother. I have seen some people with drugs, quite funny they are. Somebody came to our house and they were given drinks, and he came to me and he said, “Oh you must meet Dr. Gan!” I said, “Alright,” then again he said, “You must meet Dr. Gan!” Again he said the same thing. I said, “Why is he saying?” So, I couldn’t understand. Then my husband told me something he’s heard from someone that, “You have to meet Dr. Gan,” so he’s telling you all the time the same. So you see these drunk or drug people are diseased - you are not to bother as to what he’s saying, there’s nothing, no truth in it what he’s saying. If he says, “I recognise you,” it’s just maybe another trick of the bhoots. I don’t know, it’s nothing important. They can do anything and they can say anything. They are not normal people. They are sick, they are sick people - temporarily sick - so you cannot just trust them.

And there is a big craze in the West, I have heard people saying that, “I was in Egypt,” (in another life). I said, “How do you know?” “Because such and such person told me I was in Egypt.” I said, “What difference does it make if you were in Egypt or you were in India or whatever?” Whatever you are today is the point! So they are paying money for that, to know what they were!! That is also there, it’s a big craze going on. But that’s not [the point that] you have to find out what you have been. I mean, how do you explain, why people ask? I don’t know how to answer this question. I don’t understand, why should you ask anyone, “Where was I?” Then people make money on this kind of a nonsense that, “What was my previous birth?” Then somebody was telling me, “I was a pig in my last life,” He said, “Mother do you agree I was a pig?” (laughter) What should I say? Because if I say, “yes,” she may not like it, if I say, “no,” she may not like it. So I just avoided the question. But some sort of a thing like that. It’s very silly but human beings have funny ideas you know. Now, to be a pig! I mean, I would hate to be a pig! And the stench! But they wouldn’t mind calling themselves. I mean they are so funny that they would not mind calling themselves pigs when they are human beings you see!! I mean, you don’t know what to say.

I mean this is how it is you see. They are not to be taken seriously, very seriously. But it’s surprising that people are taken very seriously sometimes. We had a group of people coming to Gavin’s place and there was one, a realised soul who had become a drug addict, I don’t know how. He fell into very bad company. And the another fellow, whom he had regarded as something great, was really mad, absolutely mad! Isn’t it Gavin?  He was so mad [that] I don’t know how this mad man was accepted by all this group as something great. He said, “He’s beautiful Mother, you don’t know, he’s beautiful,” I said, “But which part of the thing is beautiful? You just tell me.” He is irrelevantly talking, has no sense, and nothing! He’s mad, actual mad. You can see, he went into [a] lunatic asylum. I said, “I don’t understand the worshippers of lunacy.” This is like worshipping lunacy. You just cannot understand this also, so you just cannot say.

Next time, when you come to any such programmes or any place, now you ask me, “What should we do Mother with all the mad people?” And I will tell you what is to be done so that you will not have so much of mosquito drama. It was just a mosquito drama but I’m happy you have handled it very well and you have gone just there where you were.

Now, today, I am going to tell you about Sahaja Yogi, as you are Sahaja Yogis now. You are reborn and you are realised-souls. And what we have to do about ourselves. That is a very important thing. After Sahaja Yoga, as you say that you have got realisation, you have powers also, and lots of powers are that which you are not aware of that - powers we have got.

Now, the first power you have got is to correct yourself without conditioning yourself. Before this, if I said, “Don’t do this, don’t do that!” or you did that way, you were conditioned. Let’s see what is conditioning then you will understand it better. Say, it is all darkness and I cannot see anything inside out, I am just involved into my own body and I want to treat myself. Then I put my instruments into wrong places. And the more wrong I do the more I try to  re-correct it and it goes even worse and worse and worse. But supposing there is all light, and in you there is a doctor who comes out of you. You get separated from that doctor completely and the doctor, who is not involved into your pains and into your troubles. Who can see through, what’s wrong with you and he is the only well-wisher you have: then the operation is perfect. There is no conditioning because there is no wrong doing anywhere, he knows what to open, what to close, where to put it right. This doctor is the Witness in you, he’s your Spirit. When you start seeing through that Doctor, everything - you do not feel bad about it. Just now, as you said that, we are catching on the left Swadhishthan: it means such a terrible thing. It means that you are practising something which is unauthorised. That means it is blasphemous. You are doing something anti-God. Taking the responsibility upon yourself to do that. But you don’t feel bad about it because you are separated from yourself and you see that, “If I am catching on this, that means there is an effect of something on me by which this part of the centre is suffering and I must correct it.” And you start correcting it because you feel the pain with it. Supposing your Agya is catching here: means you are egoistical, you are dominating, you are non-forgiving, you are like a Hitler. But you don’t feel bad, once your Agya is catching, it’s paining, you say, “Take it out Mother my ego is colossal. Take it out!” You don’t mind saying that. If somebody had told this to Napoleon that, “You are egoistical,” he would have killed them. If you would have told this to Hitler he would have finished you off. He carried on with all his vices, all his self-destroying things with great pride but a Sahaja Yogi cannot. So he has much more chances  and much, much instruments to clear himself and to make himself alright, to change himself without feeling hurt about it because he’s no more identified with his vices. He’s not identified with his ego so he does not mind correcting himself, his ego. He can do that very easily without conditioning himself.

You see, about religions, the greatest objection was that it conditions people, so they started the other side of it to decondition people. So the permissiveness and licentiousness started. One was conditioning, the other was deconditioning.  But if you cannot be conditioned what is the question of deconditioning?

So for a Sahaja Yogi, there is the power given, of loving himself [so] that he corrects himself in True Love. I don’t know how much really we know how much we have to love ourselves. If you truly love yourself, truly love yourself, then you would like to do something of which you are really proud, within your heart. Say giving realisation to someone is such a joy-giving thing within yourself. You feel so happy about it. You may do hundreds of things in this world but you won’t feel that way as you would feel when you have given realisation to someone because it’s a living process which you can do. But when you really understand yourself, the need of your Self, then you really love yourself. Otherwise you really do not know what to do to love yourself. To love yourself means that you must know that this body of yours is a special body now because it is emitting vibrations. It’s a temple of God so respect it. Respect your body. Don’t be vulgar about your body. We really had like Mary Magdalene somebody in India who came to us….(break in recording)… keep it clean, in the sense, yes I mean washing and this thing, you know that’s not the point. But even many people I have seen that many people are not aware that we get uncleanliness from others, like shaking hands. I mean, if there is someone, you have to shake hands, alright, if you are that much developed that you do not get unclean it’s alright. But if you are not, be careful if you shaking hands. Better to say, “hello” and things. You have to be a little particular about it because I have seen people, when they shake their hands, they do receive more bad vibrations than [they] give good vibrations to others. Shaking hands or hugging others, or bringing your body to them only, one has to be very careful as to [see that] you do not spoil. Then this body is nurtured on food, so food also is important that a food that is cooked  by a person who is loving, good, nice, is good for this body. But if you eat a food cooked by a person who is, say, a murderer (??) , immediately your body will revolt, your stomach will revolt against it and that’s why, to keep your stomach alright, try to avoid such places which give you bad vibrations. Your digestion will be very bad if you go to places which are not good. For example, going to Soho I always feel like vomiting! Always, as soon as I go there I feel like vomiting, the whole of my stomach and I must have vomited once or twice in that area, I’m sure about it. Maybe more. But first I didn’t know it was so related, I discovered that it was in Soho that this happens. And this kind of a feeling comes up when you go to places like that. So avoid all such places of vices and things. Even if you see such pictures and all that. Not that something goes that you are not above it - you are - but I mean nobody likes filth, you know. We are above everything  but we cannot sit in the filth.  You are sensitive to this. As animals are not sensitive to many filths that we have around but we are, in the same way you start getting sensitive to the filth, the inner filth, that subtler filth that we do not see. So you avoid it. Try to avoid it and you will feel much better. And you will yourself feel your priorities will change, your friends will change, your everything will change and automatically you will not like many things that people are talking about and just your interest will go away. For example, now I asked people just for  one’s sake, “What about Jeremy Thorpe?” ( A homosexual British Member of Parliament accused of murder) They said, “Mother we are not reading that these days.” Normally some of you would have known the whole case so well, even better than the pleader himself. But they don’t read it now, just don’t read it. “It’s filth. It’s so horrid, horrid.” It’s like that.

Your tastes change, your styles change. But allow it to grow and manifest itself and accept it. Gradually it will work out. If you press on it, say you are used to the smoking, you will give up smoking, you will not like it. First you will feel like vomiting about it and all that. But still if you insist, “No, I must smoke, I must smoke,” then you can accept it (the smoking) because then you are giving chance to your ego to ??. Now this is the part I’m saying about the body; now you see all the hang ups of it that, how we affect our body very much.

Another thing is too much interest in food will go away, should go away. You should not be too much interested in taste and food and this and that. Also there are crazes about things: the other day I met a lady, she was very thin, I mean, absolutely I didn’t understand and I said, “What’s the matter with you?” So she said, “Now I eat all healthy food.” I said, “How do you call it healthy?” She said, “There’s a health store I go to and I get my things from there and only that thing I buy.” All this is a craze! Spiritual health is very different from the so-called ‘vitaminised’ health. You see, Spiritual health is the health you get from love, from the food of love. It’s different from food of so-called wrestlers bodies, the kind of thing the wrestlers eat. Food of love, we have to take it with love and give it with love and made with love, that is the food is of the highest of all. So, that’s the body part of it, we can see how to look after the body is to not to think too much about food and spontaneously, if somebody gives you something with love, you just take it. That’s how you should eat. But if anybody gives you with hatred don’t take that food. It’s better not to eat such a food than to eat a poisonous thing, it’s poisonous for Sahaja Yogis.

Then another thing is to give to others also. We have to be giving to others, food especially. I don’t know how many of you bring chocolates for each other, or something like this, or something nice that you find: supposing you go somewhere and you find some nice cherries or something, then how many of you collect it and give it? Do you bring them for Sahaja Yogis? “Alright let me take it for, say in Sainsbury’s (shop) let me take this money when I am there”. This is how you are going to have the articulation, means that you can articulate, you can communicate through this type of love. You see, a small thing like that, you go somewhere, for Mother you do bring, I know, but for each other, something small and to find out what does he like. Now, I know Dinesh is uncomfortable because he’s a tall fellow and I have been telling him that you sit somewhere on a high thing, because I’m feeling it, I can feel it within myself because I love him and I can feel it because I know tall people have a problem, there height is too much and their centre of gravity is all the time going like that. There’s nothing wrong in it. Anybody who sits next to him should say, “It’s alright, now come along, sit down properly. Come along, sit down properly.” It’s full and somebody who can sit on the ground should offer a seat saying that, “Come along Dinesh, you can sit here.” It should be that way. You see what I am trying to say [is] that: let’s see small, small things that are needed by others. It’s a very sweet way of living together is - let’s see what do you need. I mean, you are going to Germany now so I’ll be very happy if you bring something for a friend of yours than for me, hundred times [happier], because that is much more nourishing for me. That’s my food to think, “Oh, my child has been so generous,” One day Gavin really gave me the very great happiness and I told him that. You see, one day he invited me to his place and he had lots of people that day and I was embarrassed. I said, “Now Gavin has invited people for dinner but how can so many people be fed, there are so many.” Of course, I knew it would be sufficient but it was just a play I should say. So I allowed about fifty percent of them to disappear and I said, “Let’s have dinner now.” So then he gave us dinner but he was a little bit unhappy. Next day he got up and he said, “Mother why did you ask half of them to go away? And then why did you ask for food so late? Because I had cooked for all of them.” And this was something so joy-giving. I didn’t mind those twenty-five going away for this joy that I got, really. Out of that same is that: how much we do for others? Small, small things, you see. And we should not be jealous in that part. Like, supposing Mia does something for our doctor, then Lindsay should not be jealous of that, on the contrary he should realise that it’s nice that he has done. He should feel happy because doctor is also part of your being. Actually as I feel happy, you should feel happy. From this you should know that, if it is done for others and if you see that, it’s much more joy-giving than if it is done for yourself. I tell you it’s a headache, it’s a headache sometimes if something is done for you, you get into a problem you see, “How am I to now pay it off, he’s done so nice now. I must somehow or other try to pay it back that same way as he did.” You feel that he has been so nice and so kind here and so sweet and , “I am not that much, I have never thought of  these things how he is capable of these things.” So, this idea can come because you have seen [that] you go from one side to another, so as soon as these things happen, that will happen. And also jealousies can come in. Both things should be avoided and should really enjoy to see a friend [happy]. Why we do it everyday, you don’t know we do it everyday that way, in a very unknown way. Supposing you read a nice story and what is the story you enjoy the best? When you find two persons are loving each other without any selfishness. I mean why do we enjoy? None of us are there. The girl is not we and the boy is not we. We are something different, but we enjoy because we really enjoy that, in the universal happiness that somebody has done that for someone in that genuine way. Those, I mean, the Indians who have been reading novels and things say that there is a very great writer that we have in our country [called] Sarat Chandra; and if you ask them, “Which is the story that you like the best in that?” We’ll say, “There’s one ‘Rameshawar ’” is a story. And in that story it’s the beauty of the artist, of the writer is this way, is they show the sister-in-law and the sister-in-law having great love for the small little brother-in-law who is a step-brother of her husband. And this little brother-in-law first of all wants to find out about his would be sister-in-law and goes and tells his brother that, “You see I must go and see the girl first of all,” as in India it’s a custom that the elders go and see the girl, “I must approve of the girl otherwise how can you marry her? I must approve of the girl,” you see like a grandfather you see, just all that. Very sweetly built up the whole thing. But it comes to the climax at a point where this lady has her mother there and she’s a horrid thing and she hates this boy because the daughter loves that child. And he’s just a little boy and he has the half property and all that and he doesn’t understand. Eight year old simple boy you see. So whatever he does she tries to find faults with it. So he brings one tree of banyan, small, little tree he gets a shoot somewhere and he brings it up in the centre of the house in the courtyard and he plants it there. Of course it’s not going to live, it’s a dead stuff, but like a child he brings it and plants it there. So the climax is brought out by the artist, I must say the way it is brought out is beautiful. So, when it is put there this old lady comes she gets very angry and throws away all the thing out. So the boy comes out in the morning time and he sees that the tree is gone, now it is no more there. For him it’s something gone out of his life, he feels so unhappy. So he goes to his sister-in-law and she’s standing before him and he goes on the steps and he starts asking, “Why did you throw away?” She says, “I did it,” because she didn’t want the mother to be there. “Why did you do it? Why did you do it?” Showing all his tortured being, that, “Why did you do it?” So she just takes him to her heart and she says, “Do you know why I did it?” So he says, “Why?” “Because if you put a Banyan tree in the courtyard then the death of the elder sister-in-law takes place.” He said, “Oh God! Really? Then have you thrown it permanently? Throw it away in the river! I hope it will have no effect. Put something there. Bring something just do something that it is finished off.” You see, the whole thing is so beautifully brought in. And the beauty of love between them we enjoy. And that’s how we should look at things when anybody does for anything. Where does the jealousy come in? Just to kill our joy, just to kill our joy. It is nice to to see this is done to others, so much beautiful. That’s why the people who have been described in the novels may not have enjoyed so much as we are enjoying them because we can see that much better and feel good. But in every day to day life we do not do that, we do no do that. For example, a step-mother-in-law, if she’s horrid or step-mother she’s horrid, she’ll go and see a picture (movie) of a step-mother and will weep there at the way the step-mother is stern, and at home she will come and again beat her own child. Human beings are like that. So try to enjoy that. You don’t know, human beings are very complicated. If I see it I don’t understand, really, why they do it like that. But when we can enjoy the novels, why not the novel is just here between the friends, between all of us? Let’s have a novel and a play among ourselves, how we do beautiful things and how we try to love each other.

This is how we have to work out among ourselves by doing little, little things here and there and that’s how we are going to beautify ourselves. Now this joy-giving quality of enjoying others is present in you already; is awakened now through Sahaja Yoga and trying to make your life joyous. I have seen many Sahaja Yogis who say, “Mother, we have got knowledge no doubt, our attention is there, but  what about the anand, the joy?” I mean, you are killing your joy every moment! You are bent upon killing your joy every moment, what can I do about it? Those who have been able to overcome that part, then there is more possibility. On the other side of it, supposing somebody you see, who is not doing the proper thing about Sahaj Yoga say, somebody who has started drinking after Sahaja Yoga, then you should go and fight it out with him. Sit down with him for day and night and fight it out with him and see to it.  You just say that, “I’m going on a fast because you have taken to drinking.” Work it out! Put all the pressures that are possible under your command. Tell all the Sahaja Yogis, all of you work it out.

You know, I was very happy sometimes people told me, “Mother, will you please put attention to such-and-such,” all of you put together, if they say, then I say, “They are on right stages.” “We are all fasting for such and such person, we are doing this for such and such people. We are working on such and such person.” And go and fight with that person, tell him on his face and do it. That something is great. This is also another way of, really, to communicate between yourselves, to think about the emancipation of others, about the awakening of others and to put them onto right stages. You will find [that] all of you have some sort of a problem by which you do not open out to each other. Open out to each other, talk to each other. Openly discuss it. When you will go to India, those who are coming, will see how these people are that way absolutely shameless. They will say, “Come along, this is catching, take it out! Beat me with shoes, do that. Take my shoes and keep it with them and use that for taking it out.” And they’ll say, “You beat me with shoes, go on! Just beat me with shoes! I am catching here, you go and beat me with shoes.”

Unless and until you get after your weaknesses you cannot get rid of them. You should ask yourself, “Oh Mr., come along Mr. Sahaja Yogi, now what is your name, this is your problem, alright? So now let me take you to task.”

See to your weaknesses, see to your weaknesses and the strengths of others. And build up your strength and ignore the weaknesses of others. But if it is destroying that person, then get together, many of you, not one, many of you, and go to that person and save him. This is how it is going to work out among yourselves.

Now the biggest problem of the West, because now we are dealing with the majority of the Western people, is E-G-O, absolutely simple. It’s a very simple thing and I have given you the reason why there is so much of ego and why we have been working through ego and how we have been depending on it. Now this Mr. Ego is the one which gives you ideas, it goes to such a limit of ideas giving that even people commit sin because their ego is satisfied by saying, “What do I care for this God? Who is He?” “What are these scriptures? What do I care?” So this Mr. Ego can take human beings to any limit - any limit - of self-destruction and one has to be careful about it. This Mr. Ego only gives you a sense of jealousy, because it gets hurt immediately.

Now in this programme, if I do not take the names of two [or] three people, immediately their ego will be hurt. They will think, “Why didn’t you take my name?” And ego identifies with many things, which is a very big problem also, which is such a subtle thing. Now, for example, two friends are there, so they will always club together. Then, if I say one thing to one friend he will say, “Mother, why don’t you say to the other friend?” They will say, “Why don’t you say this to other friend?” but not to the whole congregation but to the other friend. All the time that friend is pushed forward. He says, “Why don’t you look after this friend of mine?” Or they’ll push forward in everything - somebody whom they think must be pushed forward. And this kind of identification in someone, is ego’s job. And that’s how it keeps you there. It gives you identifications, this way, that way, and you have to disentangle yourself. Know,  “As far as my growth is concerned, I’m alone. There I am alone. As far as my own achievements are concerned, I am alone. I am no identified with anyone. I am identified with Truth.” But as far as the Sahaja Yoga and the whole thing, is concerned then all of us must do it together - that way. We should all feel it, that way, together. So there won’t be any problem when you all live together but you will enjoy yourself.

Small things like saying, “Why don’t you come to my place?” Call them over. Then you tell others like this. You are all saints. A day will come when you will be respected much more than all these kings and queens put together. You are saints and you have to behave like saints towards each other, you have to respect because you are saints and that God is in you now emitting It’s light as vibrations. Every Sahaja Yogi must respect another Sahaja Yogi. And it is a simple thing which one should know. But we do not know it so well because of the one problem is ego. But in India people understand it because the ego is not so much developed there, that may be why. I wrote to them about a lot of people might be wanting to come to India, what about them? So everyone wrote to me, “Mother, what a great pleasure that saints are coming to our country now. To our country they are visiting. Oh we’ll be having a big festivity. We are going to have a festival of things.” And they were going to take a house in Bombay for 30,000 rupees for a month for you people, because “it should be proper, it should be comfortable.” I said, “Now, nothing doing! There will be hardly twelve people coming and we just don’t spend so much money.” They would have given you a red carpet treatment and those who have been there, you can ask them how they have treated them. “Because the saints are coming and we must serve the saints and they are saints and we must respect them.” This is the idea they have there. In the same way, you should know we have to respect each other because we are all saints. We have entered into the Kingdom of God. We have been blessed by Him and we have to understand that we are all individually dear to God and He has bestowed upon us that light.
