Public Program, 1994-10-18

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very outset, I have to tell you that truth is what it is. We cannot change it. We cannot describe it. Unfortunately, at this human awareness, we cannot feel it. Absolute truth has to be felt on you central nervous system. Now, whatever I am going to tell you tonight, you have to take it not for granted at all. We have had inner problems of blind faith. But if you treat it as a hypothesis and if it is proved, then you have to accept it as honest people. The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, these emotions, these conditioning and ego. But you are the pure Spirit.

Here now you see beautiful flowers and we take it for granted. Actually it is a miracle. Many livings things, we take it for granted. Who runs your heart? If you ask the doctor, he will say: "It is autonomous nervous system." But who is this "auto"? So the second truth is that there's a All-Pervading Subtle Power of Divine Love that does all the living work. We cannot feel this Power on our fingers, but it exists. Today for the first time you all are going to feel it. It is called in the Bible as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

In the Koran, it is called as Ruh. And in the Indian scriptures, it is called as Paramchaitanya. Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara PrAgnya. So in all the books, this Chaitanya has been described by different names. So "saha" means "with, "ja" means "born", is the right to have this yoga, this union. You all have this right to have this union with the Divine Power. Specially at this time, it was to happen. It's already been predicted. They called as Last Judgment, in the Koran they called it as Kyiama. And the great astrologer, the pioneer of Astrology, Gehrig has written that at this time, thousands will get their enlightenment.

I call it a blossom time, where there are so many seekers of truth who have a right to get their enlightenment. So it is through the evolutionary process, the last breakthrough. This Power that connects you to the All-Pervading Power is called as Kundalini. "Kundal" is different circles. That's why it is called as Kundalini. It rests in the triangular bone which is called as sacrum, that means that Greeks knew that is a sacred bone. When this Power rises, it passes through six centres. All the problems of the world are mostly from human beings. And most of the problems of human beings come from these subtle centres within us. Thus when this Kundalini rises and passes through six centres and enlightens the fontanel bone area, passes through it, then it enlightens all the centres.

It integrates it and also it corrects it. These centres are for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. Thus all our problems on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being are solved. In Delhi, there are two doctors who have got their MD for curing incurable diseases in Sahara Yoga. All over the world, we have doctors who are curing people of incurable diseases. The second thing that happens to you that your attention becomes innocent. Innocence is eternal, it's never lost. Of course there are some clouds on it. But with the awakening of the Kundalini, your innocence is established. And your attention becomes innocent devoided of lust and greed.

Such an innocence, innocent attention is very powerful. And wherever it goes, it emits peace and joy. The another thing that happens to you automatically is that you can feel these centres on your fingertips. Is not going to people at all, is not, they can't hear Me. Is alright? This attention is innocent, but also is active. You can cure your centres by your pure attention. Also you can feel the centres of others on your fingertips. In the Koran, it is written very clearly that at the time of Kyiama, that is the resurrection, your hands will speak and they will give witness against you. So your attention, whenever you put it, is so pure that it acts on others also.

But who is the other? Because you become, you become again collectively conscious, that you can feel the attention of others very clearly on your fingertips, the centres of others on your fingertips. Thus you have self-knowledge on you central nervous system. For example, we go to religion to find out a solution. For example, people like Christ and Mohammed Saab, very highly evolved Incarnations came on this Earth. We could not understand Them and They could not understand human beings. They did not know what sort of people they are facing. For example, Christ has said in the fifth chapter, Mathews, if your one eye commits a sin, take it down. And if your hand commits a sin, cut it out. If someone slaps you on one cheek, you turn another cheek.

I Myself was born in a Christian family and I never see any man doing that without two eyes and without two hands. Christ was talking to saints. That's why He talked, that He was talking to angels. And Mohammed Saab was even worse, because He thought Christ has been very strict on men, why not on women? So He also said horrible things that have to be done to women. That if a woman looks another man with lust, she must be buried half in the Mother Earth and should be stoned till she is dead. Imagine what would have happened to American women, I can't understand. Where they could have been? On top of that, Shariat, which was given by Moses to the Jews, who were very decadent, greed took it over, because Jews defied it. So we can see that these restrictions are for people who are enlightened.

And not for ordinary human beings. So first ordinary human beings have to become enlightened. They have to enter into the Kingdon of God. There only they can be punished like this. But in Sahaja Yoga, we have no punishments. Forgiveness is the only remedy, up to a point. And even after that if people continue to do wrong, then they are requested to get out of Sahaja Yoga. But once you get enlightenment, you become righteous, nobody has to tell you: "Don't do this, don't do that." In the light of the Spirit, you become your guide, your own master. Whatever is destructive, you give up and take to constructive for you life.

This is like this, supposing I am an obstinate person and I have a snake in My hand and there's darkness. And you tell Me that there's a snake, but I will not give up because I am obstinate till the snake bites Me. But if there's a little light, immediately I will Myself give up. Nobody has to tell Me. You yourself become virtuous and righteous. So your health becomes first class, your mind becomes first class, because of that, your financial problems are also solved. We actually live in a relative world. Either we are thinking about the past or about the future. We are jumping on the cusp of this thoughts. But past is finished and future doesn't exist.

We have to be in the present. And that is very difficult. When Kundalini rises She elongates those thoughts and our attention stands in the middle. And we become thoughtlessly aware. Means you are fully aware, but there's no thought from the future and the past. That is the time you grow spiritually and we get inspirations from the Divine. So we are in the present, which is the reality. And we know the reality, we become absolutely confident. Now the another thing that is very remarkable is that you know the absolute truth. That too on your fingertips.

,Many people don't believe that there is God. Many people don't believe that Christ was the Son of God. But after enlightened, you just put your hands like this and ask the question: "Is there God?". And you feel a tremendous cool breeze flowing. Supposing there is a man false who comes and meets you, you just put your hands towards that person and you immediately will know what sort of a person he is. By recording the sensations on your central nervous system which is indicated on your fingertips, you can know everything. Such a person is blessed by the Divine Power. To such an extent that once they get Realization, they write letters to Me what miracles have happened to them. I've told somebody: "You better compile", and within one month, he telephoned to Me that: "They have come up over my head, I don't know what to select." When you become thoughtlessly aware, you become absolutely peaceful within yourself.

I have seen people have got awards of peace, but what I know that they have no peace within themselves. And if you have to meet them, better take a barge pole. They are so hot-tempered. So egoistical and arrogant. How can you have peace if you have no peace within yourself? With Sahaja Yoga, it has been created a new race of extremely peaceful, loving, dynamic people. Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations. Of course in India is not difficult, but Russia has been a wonderful place for Sahaja Yoga. Russians are extremely sensitive to spirituality. At least 65 to 70%.

The rest are materialistic, they want Malboro cigarette and all kinds of things. But they are all very well educated and this people has such a sense of spirituality. For example, Saint Petersburg University, which is one of the oldest universities, gave Me an award of Honorary Academician. And the tenth person to get it so far. And one of them is Einstein. And I was surprised, I asked them: "How do you put Me in the same line as Einstein?" So they said: "What Einstein has done is on the matter," but You can work on human beings." In that conference there were two thousand great scientists. And they gave the subject of Medicine and Self-knowledge. But there were many others who spoke on morality and health.

Morality has become a prime subject for these people. I was surprised scientist talking of morality. Because science is unmoral. And that is what they said that there is a gap with the science. I must tell you that I've been there only four times and in one place only, one place called Tolyatti, we have 21.000 Sahaja Yogis. There is a joke that they went once and one of the Toliatti Sahaja Yogi asked an American one: "How many Sahaja Yogis you have in America?" He said: "There are fifty-six." So a Toliatti Sahaja Yogi said: "Oh my God, "you have 56.000, we have 21.000 only in Toliatti." Because Americans lack maturity. They lack wisdom.

They live like Hollywood actors and actresses, in the imaginary world. Like a one lady married eight times and ninth time she was going with a very young man for her honeymoon. And there were four, five thousand people just to see her going for her honeymoon. Not only that, but there were ten helicopters from where there were parachute down taking photographs They fell on people and some on trees. I must say India may be a poor country, but you won't get even one person to see such idiotic things. So Sahaja Yoga is not meant for idiots and for superficial people. It is of course not meant for arrogant. But it is meant for people who are true seekers of truth. In this seeking, people do go to wrong things. They have gone to false gurus, doesn't matter.

You should know that we cannot pay for your enlightenment. God doesn't know money. He doesn't understand banking, that is our headache. So, if somebody ask money for your enlightenment, you better understand that he is a cheat. Also enlightenment doesn't mean some sort of a dressing up or shaving your hair. A great poet Kabira has said: "If by shaving your hair, if you are going to get your Nirvana, then the sheep who it is shaved every year will go there first." This time in Chicago, you will be surprised, I saw a Hare Rama fellow, the leader who came with a dot, that you wear, very light cloth. It was really very cold and as a Mother, I felt concern what is he after all. Then I asked him: "Why you are wearing a dot? It is so very cold, you will get troubles."

So he said that "My guru has initiated and I am supposed to wear only dot, whether it is cold or not." And he said, "That is how it is I am going to get my Nirvana." I said, "In India, 80% people wear dots, if they are going to get Nirvana, then where you will be?" There is another really shocking thing. In Cabella, one fellow came and he told Me, that "I have become a very poor man, because all my money I have given to Dalai Lama." So in the name of God, how many types of people there are who are cheating, I have to tell you all these things because I am your Mother. I am not afraid of them. I am only afraid that you people are great seekers and you should not be lost. Guru Nanak has said, "The one who is a real master is the one who makes you meet the Divine." Christ also said that "You are to be born again."

In Sanskrit, we have the word called "dwija" for a bird and also for an enlighten soul. That means a person who is born again like the bird. The bird is first an egg and then it becomes a bird, it has a second birth. In the same way, we have to have our second birth, where you get complete transformation. As it is, several people have that, "we are born again, we are Christians, Hindus, Muslims", these are nothing but brands. You maybe are a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything, but you can commit any mistake and can commit any sin. In Sahaja Yoga, you become, becoming is the point. And when the Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area, is the actualization of your baptism, actualization. It is the experience of feeling the Divine. Is not a lecture or it is not a sermon.

But the greatest thing that happens to you that you jump in the ocean of joy. Happiness and unhappiness are two sides of a coin. But joy is singular. Where you become the source of peace and you witness the whole world as a drama. But you yourself become the light of peace and joy. Sahaja Yoga is working in 55 nations now. And I am amazed that I've never seen anybody quarreling, fighting or even arguing. They all enjoy each others company. Such pure love, friendship that you really feel a new age has started. Very pure relationships of husband and wife, sisters, brothers, I've never heard somebody running away with somebody's wife or somebody's husband in Sahaja Yoga.

I really know there are so many great souls who want to be born on this Earth. And if they are born to non Sahaja Yogi, they will never understand their children. Moreover they are anxious to be born to Sahaja Yogis. In this lecture, I cannot tell you everything about Sahaja Yoga, I'm sorry. Only in English language, I must have addressed five thousand lectures so far. But it is like this, we have so many beautiful lights here. And we have to just put on one switch and all the lights come in. Because it is built in. In the same way, it is built in within you. This is your own power.

This is your own glory. All your protection powers will manifest. So many artists, musicians have become world famous today. You will be happy to know this time, Miss Universe was a Sahaja Yogini. She is going to see Me and she said, "I don't want to wear funny dresses." I said, "No, you can wear, if you can wear swimming dresses, is alright, doesn't matter, you go ahead." She is a very simple, intelligent girl. I wouldn't say she is a beauty or anything according to Hollywood standards. But her innocence and her pose or her intelligence has achieved this wisdom for her that she is today Miss Universe. So is a very remarkable thing that we don't know what qualities we have, what potential we have, how dynamic people we are.

It is like a candle which is not get enlightened but a enlightened candle can enlighten the one which is not enlightened. This is like is a seed, if it is embedded in the Mother Earth, it sprouts spontaneously, sahaja. Because the seed as well the Mother Earth has the built in quality to sprout. So believe Me, all of you have got this. And it will work out. Please have no doubts about yourself. Another thing is that this Power that is in the triangular bone is the Power of Pure Desire. All desires are not pure. You want to have house today, then you want to have a car, then want to have a helicopter, I don't know, goes on like that. There is no end.

According to economics: wants are not satiable in general. Because they are not pure wants, pure desires. So you should have full confidence and also should have desire to be one with the Divine Power. I cannot force on you, you have to ask for it. Because I respect your freedom. This Power is your individual Mother. She knows everything about you. Like a tape recorder, She knows what are your desires, what are your aspirations. And She is very anxious to give you your second birth. And as when you were born, your mother took all the troubles, this Mother of yours takes all the trouble and you get your Self-Realization.

It will hardly take fifteen minutes. But those who don't want to have it should leave the hall. Because they cannot get it also. On the contrary, they will disturb you. If you have faith in yourself, I'm sure it will work out. You have to respect yourself, Because you are a human being at epitome of evolution. Now as I told you that this Kundalini, your Mother, knows everything about you. Please do not judge yourself. She knows, She judges you. So first condition is that you should not feel guilty at all.

Whatever has happened in the past has happened. Why carry the guilty on your left side, this centre? As a result of this mythical behaviour, you get spondylitis, or you get angina, or you get lethargic organs. You might even get diseases like tuberculosis. So why to carry this myth of guilt? You have to really forgive yourself. And should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. Even in My lecture, if you think that I have said something that makes you feel guilty, forget it. The second condition is even simpler if you understand it. You have to forgive everyone even without thinking about them, because it is a headache to think about it.

Now, logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do? You don't do anything. But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. All your life, you tortured yourself. But at this moment is important to get this centre and the centre in the optic chiasma opened out. If you feel guilty, this centre won't open and the Kundalini won't pass through. But the worst is the centre on the optic chiasma which is constricted like this. And it won't open unless and until you forgive everyone without thinking about them. As it is you are playing into wrong hands and by not forgiving you will miss the most important thing that is your enlightenment. Third condition is very simpler that I request you to get out your shoes I'm sorry I have to say that because in England, first time I said: "Please take out your shoes", half of them left the hall.

This help us to be in contact with the Mother Earth, which help us a lot. Now, you don't say any prays, any mantras, nothing. Please don't try to concentrate. Kundalini Itself will take your attention upward. Alright. Those who are sitting on the ground are alright. But those who are sitting on the chair have to keep both their feet apart from each other. Please all of you do it, otherwise you can go. Because the left and right are two powers. The left one is the power of desire And the right one is the power of action.

First we tell you how to nourish your centre with your self-confidence. These exercises have to be done only for tonight, afterwards you don't have to do anything. Now, so please put your left hand towards Me like this on your lap very comfortably sitting. Why he is not doing himself there? What is the matter with you? If you don't want to do, you can go out. What is the matter? Alright. Now please understand that you have to be comfortable in your chair, but not slouch, not put one foot on top of other, but comfortably sitting. You don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your head.

You don't have to give up anything. I have told you it is not outside, but inside something has to happen. So please put your left hand on your lap, which is symbolizing that you have a desire to have your Self-Realization. Now put your right hand on your heart. We use our right hand for nourishing our centres on the left hand side. In the heart resides the Spirit. Please put left hand towards Me, try to understand, left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart, please. Now, we put our hand on the heart, where resides the Spirit. Now we take our right hand to the upper portion of abdomen on the left hand side. I've told you that if you become the Spirit, you become your master.

So this is the centre of your mastery, which is created by prophets and seers. Now, we take our right hand to the lower portion of abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre, surprisingly, is of pure divine knowledge. Now we take it up again in the upper portion of your abdomen. Then we take it on our heart. Then in the corner of the neck and shoulder and turn our head to right. I've already told you about this centre. And quite that is in today with you, please don't feel guilty at all. I tell you, you have done nothing wrong. After all you are human beings and only human beings can commit mistakes, you are not gods.

In Sahaja Yoga, there's no confession and there's no guilty. Is only love, compassion and forgiveness. Now, raise your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head. Here you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them. Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading Divine Power. So take back your right hand on the back side of your head. This is the centre for asking forgiveness. Now the last centre, you have to stretch your palm fully. And put the centre of your palm on top of fontanel bone area, which is a soft bone (...) your scalp. Now please, put down your head.

And move your scalp seven times slowly. That is all you have to do. Now you have to close your eyes. Before that, see that you put your both the feet apart from each other and your left hand on your lap. Now, please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you. Take down your hands now. And now put your right hand on your heart. Close your eyes. Now, here your have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself. You can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

So please say three times, ask a question: "Mother, am I the Spirit?" I have told already to you that if you become the Spirit, you become your own master. So please take your right hand upper portion of you abdomen on the left hand side. And here, you have to ask another fundamental question about yourself three times. Please ask Me in your heart three times: "Mother, am I my own master?" Now, I have already told you that I respect your freedom. And I cannot force on you the Pure Divine Knowledge. You have to ask for it. So please put down your hand in the left hand side of your abdomen, in the lower region. Here you ask again six times because this centre has got six petals.

Here you have to ask: "Mother, please give me Pure Divine Knowledge." Now, as soon as you ask for Pure Divine Knowledge, your Kundalini starts moving upward. So we have to nourish upper centres with your self-confidence. Please now put your right hand the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say ten times with your full self-confidence: "Mother, I am my own master." At very outset, I told you that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, these emotions, your ego or your conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit. So now please raise your hand on your heart and say again with full self-confidence twelve times: "Mother, I am the pure Spirit." This All-Pervading Divine Power is the ocean of knowledge of bliss. Ocean of bliss. It is the ocean of compassion and love.

But above all, It is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes your might have committed can be easily dissolved in the power of this ocean of forgiveness. So please, forgive yourself. And put your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and push your neck to your right. Here you have to say, again, with full self-confidence sixteen times: "Mother, I am not guilty at all." I have already told you that you have to forgive everyone. Logically, whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. So it is very important to forgive everyone without thinking about them. Leave them to the Divine Power to deal.

Then you all raise your hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your head. Here you have to say from your heart not how many times: "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." At this moment, if you don't forgive, then this centre which is so constricted won't open and the Kundalini cannot pass through it. Now without feeling guilty, without pointing your mistakes, for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading Divine Power. So please take your right hand back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to say, again, from your heart, not how many times: "Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly. Now the last centre, which is very important. You have to stretch your hand fully, the palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area, it was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please put down your head. Please stretch your fingers outward.

Here again I cannot force enlightenment on you, you have to ask for it. So now move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise, saying seven times: "Mother, please give me my Self-Realization." Now please take down your hands. And open your eyes slowly. Put both the hands towards Me like this. And watch Me without thinking. Now please put your right hand towards Me like this. And put down your head. See with the left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations coming from your fontanel bone area Please bend your head. And don't put your hand on top of the head, but away from it, near it.

Now please turn, put the left hand towards Me like this. Again bend your head and see with the right hand, if there is a hot or a cool breeze like vibrations coming out of your fontanel bone area. Some people get it further. But if it is hot, then you have not forgiven yourself or your have not forgiven others, so please do that now. Now again, lastly, put your right hand towards Me and try to feel if there is any cool or hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now do not doubt you, is coming from your own head. Bend your heads, bend your heads. Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky like this and push back your head. Here you have to ask a question three times anyone of these three questions. Please ask, first question: "Mother, this is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

Second question: "Mother, is this the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love, the Ruh? Or "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?" Ask anyone of these three questions, anyone three times. Now take down your hands. All those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips or on their palm or out of their fontanel bone area, even maybe hot, please raise both your hands. Brazil! I bow to you all the saints of Brazil. May God bless you all. May God bless you. Specially Brasilia.

May God bless you. Please, one thing I have to tell you clearly, that whatever has happened to you is a collective happening. You can only grow collectively, not in your homes, but you have to come to the collective. You don't have to pay for anything. As you know that we don't take any money, we don't have elaborate places, we are humble. So please make it a point to respect your Self-Realization. You don't have to pay, but you have to respect your Self-Realization and give little time to it. If you have any problems, they can be solved in the collective. Also they will tell you all about how to meditate, hardly for ten minutes every day. Gradually you will come to know everything and within one month time, you can become a master of Sahaja Yoga.

You will have powers to raise the Kundalini of others. You will have powers to cure others. There are so many powers of love and compassion and dynamism, that you will get the answer which science cannot give you, why are you on this Earth? Firstly you enter into the Kingdom of God and secondly to be the channel of this All-Pervading Power. This is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of your family, for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world. Thus we can create a very peaceful world. And this is the Truth you have been seeking. May God bless you all. Thank you very much.
