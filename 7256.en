Scientific Conference

[English Transcript]

Shri Mataji: Can’t have lights outside?

Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth. These are special times, I call them blossom time.

See, all the flowers are out now. In the same way human flowers have come in the seeking. Seeking the truth. For ages, they have been seeking the truth and now they are born at this special time, to get their aim. So many of them got lost because they did not know what to seek.

Even the science is a ‘seeking’. And the seeking in the science is in the limited area. Because science is diversified. Somebody is a physicist, he will seek truths in physics.

Some in the medical science, some in the chemistry, like that. And they go on diversified, all the time into different lines of seeking. But the truth is different. In the area of truth, if you have to seek, then the first thing you have to have, humility; that so far you have not known the truth.

If you think you have known the truth, then nobody can force you. But if you are humble about it, that you don't know the truth and also that you should have the purest desire to know the truth. These are special times- as I said, because, there are so many seekers who are born. And they have to get, what really they are seeking.

So far there have been lots of theories about the truth. But it never happened that they knew the truth as reality. So there has been diversification, even in all those theories. Some say, this religion is good, some say, that religion is good and all kinds of diversification started.

And science being an amoral area, there was no connection established between science and absolute truth. Science is not absolute, it is always challenged.

But truth is One. It’s singular. And it cannot be challenged. But the main thing is, the truth which is the absolute truth, has to become the reality.

As you have chemistry, you have to say, periodic law, as a reality. Also in physics, in the same way, it has to be a reality. So the seeking of truth, when it reaches that point, where the truth becomes reality, it is an absolute truth. So what is the absolute truth?

I can give you as, a theory; and it has to be proved. In a way it goes, in a way, goes beyond the field of modern science. But it is a science. It is an absolute science, which cannot be challenged, which cannot be changed. And which everyone knows as the truth.

If I say something, it’s a theory to you, but it can be proved. We don’t know much about ourselves.

We don’t know why we get those diseases which are incurable. We don’t know why people go mad or lunatic type. Schizophrenic on the physical level. Also, we don't know, how these genes are within us. And how can we change our genes?

I can go on and on and on on about these states but the main thing, is that I tell you the theory of absolute truth. For that, you don't need any academic qualification. You don't need any elegance or any kind of very ritualistic ideas. It is very very simple.

It is very simple because It is vital. For example, we know how to breathe. Nobody has told us how to breathe. But we know. How?

Because it is very vital, so this knowledge is within us. Now the time has come, it is vital, that we should all know the absolute truth. The absolute truth is, that, you are not this body, this mind, not this emotions, not this ego but you are the pure spirit.

The scientist can challenge and they should. Because you can’t see a spirit under a microscope.

So, what I’m telling you is, about, that you are the pure spirit, is a fact, is a reality, which has to work out in you.

Then the scientist will have to accept, that, it is a science; science of spirit. Now, If I say, that, we are human beings, but we are not yet, at an absolute level.

If it is absolute, then everybody will know the same. But, that is not the thing, everybody thinks differently. And accept something as a dogma. And there are fights over it. Discussions, conferences.

But this is something, that has to happen to you. It’s, you have to become something.

For example, you see so many lights. These lights are of no use if they are not connected to the mains. In the same way, if I say, that we have to get connected to the mains.

Now, what is the thing that is which I call as the all-pervading power of divine love. Now you see all these beautiful flowers. Different colours, different fragrance, different forms, if you ask a doctor, “ who runs your heart?". He will say, 'it is an autonomous nervous system'. But who is the auto? That they can’t answer. But they are honest. So they will say, ‘we don’t know’.

So one has to go beyond, this circumference of knowledge, to know, the pure knowledge.

And that I call as a modern, meta-modern discovery.

Now you are the spirit, is said by so many saints, by incarnations by everybody else. This is not a new statement. But scientist always thought, that the area of saintliness, spirituality is not connected with them. But whether you are a scientist, a doctor, a philosopher, a poet, a politician, all of you are nothing but pure spirits.

It doesn't matter what you think, as truth. Only thing, you must have a pure desire to know Absolute Truth. For this, our creator has done a tremendous job. He has put a very wonderful energy within your sacrum bone, ‘ sacrum bone’. That means, even the Greeks knew it is a sacred bone. But they got lost.

Now, this energy in the sacrum bone. Is a fact. But, first you have to verify. You should not just believe me, because I’m saying so. But, you must verify.

And also verify, if there is this all-pervading power of divine love. For that, this power, which is coiled up in the triangular bone has to rise. It has to rise, through six centres; centres of energy.

And pierce through this fontanel bone area and become connected with this all-pervading power.

Once it happens, then you get completely integrated because all these centres act in unison. These inner centres are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and also spiritual being. If it happens, a person becomes a spiritual person, in a sense that the spirit shines.

In your attention, And you know the absolute truth. You know it on your finger-tips. It’s said in ‘Koran’ Mohammed sahib clearly, that at the time of resurrection, your hands will speak against you.

That, your hands will tell what’s wrong with you. Now, again I would say, we must verify.

If it happens to you if the kundalini is awakened and you become one with this all-pervading divine love, then you start feeling cool vibrations in your hand. Very cooling vibrations. And you feel thoughtlessly aware. Because, we live in the future, or in the past through our mind. When we live in the past, it doesn't exists, it's finished. And the future doesn't exists at all. Present is the reality.

So what happens that your thoughts, do not disturb you and you become silent inside. So the first thing happens to a person, he becomes extremely peaceful. No competitions. No fighting. No violence. He becomes extremely peaceful within. And this peace is emitted out to others also. Is a science of the inner-being. That we all have. But we are yet not aware of it. So when you become absolutely peaceful. You can’t have quarrelled, you can’t have wars, any more.

If this happens in the mass scale, then whole humanity can be emancipated. And they will understand, their real value, absolute value as spiritual people.

Now, these centres get enlightened. And with this enlightenment, the first thing that happens that people get cured. I must tell you that the Russians are really very special people. I knew this long time back. I don't know how they have become so deep. Maybe, through introspection. That they get their realization, in no time.

I have known people who came to my programme and got cured. One lady, who was epileptic or something, I don’t know what she had, she came sitting on a chair, wheel-chair and then she suddenly got up and start running. It happened to so many people, that they got cured.

For which, you don't have to pay anything. You don't have to go for a diagnosis. It is can be very horrible rigmarole. You can feel it on your finger-tips. The diagnosis, what's wrong with the other person. In the same way, you can feel about yourself. All this looks so mythical, but it’s actually, ‘The Reality’.

And the saints and the great incarnations, try their level best, but could not go into the heads of people. Now mentally, all the time we are thinking- thinking, bombarded by all kinds of thoughts in our head. And we really get absolutely distressed with it and get into a funny type of situations.

Schizophrenia, very common. Mental what you can call distress and also lunas. Nowadays, a new disease has appeared is as Alzheimer. If you study, the life of a person who suffers from Alzheimer, he must be a very aggressive person. All his life, he must have really, tortured people; demanding, fighting, quarrelling, and possessive. And thinking of no end of himself or herself. Such a person can get Alzheimer, after certain age. Deviation in the brain takes place and a person assumes the lifestyle, which he had followed before; without being conscious of it.

Now there are so many things like that which can be explained, once you are connected to this all-pervading power of divine love. So as I said this divine love creates these flowers, runs our heart does all the living work. For example, this body doesn’t accept anything foreign. But, when a foetus is formed, it not only accepts, but, looks after it and expels it at the right time, at the right moment.

You can’t explain, who guides this body to do all that. So the scientist also, many of them, who are truthful have discovered, that there are many things that they cannot explain.

All this is, because, we have not yet found our destination. Once you find your destination. You’ll be amazed to see yourself being, such a great thing. Created by the love of the divine. A special person, who can cure others. Who can, give peace to others. Who can, give love to others. So many things happen.

Like you become much younger than to your age is; you become extremely creative. I have known people who were absolutely dry charted accountants, have become great poets. You become very creative. Some musicians in India, who have achieved a great name in music are mostly Sahaj Yogies.

‘Sahaj’, Sa means ‘with’, ‘ Ja’ is ‘born with you’. What is born with you, is the ‘Right’, to become an enlightened personality.

Then you start understanding all the Sufi poetry and all such mystic poetry, which you never understood, before. You become very powerful, but this is the power of love. Which doesn’t, oppress; Which cares and which loves. Another power, that you have, because you become collectively conscious.

Our learned professor, just now told you, that we are not different, we are ‘one’. it’s a fact. But, you have to 'become'. Once you 'become', then you know, you are all 'one'.

In everybody’s heart, this divinity shines. But it has to be brought, this part of the divine has to be brought into your attention. And when it happens, your attention becomes enlightened. Paying attention to anybody, you can help. Paying attention to any country, you can help. Your attention is so powerful, that it can cross thousands and thousands of miles. The attention controls the Sun and the Moon. You will be amazed, how powerful you have become.

Now, if it’s very very cold, it will become hot, tolerably hot. And if it is intolerably hot, with your presence, it will become mild.

In the presence of such a person, these flowers though they are cut out, they start blowing, though they are cut off.

The vitality, which we call as the life vitality, you become the source of that. But, ‘Becoming’ is the point.

I must say Russia, is a very special country. I know you have gone through lots of problems. But that has really made pure gold out of you.

And the people here, only the scientist of this country are so open headed. Nowhere in the world, I’ve found so many scientists with such an open head.

Of course, we have some people in other countries. But so many we have here, who are scientist, who are dealing with the material science and suddenly become spiritual scientists.

With this collective consciousness, you can feel the centres of others, as well. You can of course feel you own centres through self-knowledge and if you, somehow, know, how to cure yourself, you can cure others. Sitting down here, you will know how to cure others.

You will know about the people who had a past, who are. ‘no more’, also about them, you will know on your fingertips.

You will not bother as to what dress they are making, how they look, but what are there centre is like. Don’t have to go into details about it, you don't have to study like a science study.

I must say I have also read science and medical science because I knew I'll have to talk to a scientist as well as to doctors.

And it has worked here in this great country of yours, I really tell you how people, who are so well educated, so highly placed in life are so humble, to accept this knowledge.

For this you don’t have to pay. Is a natural process of your evolution.

You were an ordinary human being but now you have become a spiritual human being. This will change your life completely.

You will be peaceful and you will be witnessing the whole thing, like a drama. Also, the greatest thing happens to you, that, you become joyous.

You are full of joy. Joy is singular, it’s not happiness or unhappiness, it’s just Joy.

You don’t criticise, you don’t find faults with others. But you enjoy everything, even you laugh at the absurdities and ridiculousness.

Now, if you see in these modern times; when you are born, people have become, some of them have become, worse than animals. They do things which even, animals don’t do.

Also, there are other problems like drugs and this and that. But by telling them, not to do, they will never accept on the mental level.

But after self-hood, you become so dignified and you know this is all so ridiculous.

In England, overnight the young people gave up drugs. Overnight, people changed.

So this is the time of this transition, of this resurrection.

For which you don’t have to do anything outside. It’s only in your own body, it will work. It’s your ‘right’ to have it.

And as this flower has a right to flower and give fragrance, in the same way, you have ‘right to be enlightened’.

No obligation of mine. I just love.

Especially Russia, I really love you very much. Because you are so lovable, people.

That, you respect me also as Mother, I love you like my children.

I don’t know, how to explain a Mother having millions of children. But it is so. And it is so energy-giving to me as well as to you.

There is a record of love. I don’t have to quarrel with you, argue with you or to shout at you, it just works.

You don’t know this divine power it's such a powerful thing. How it manages things.

How it manipulates everything, for your good. Everything negative drops out. Anything that is aggressive disappears. And your life becomes very smooth and beautiful.

You become a satisfied soul. I think Russians are quite satisfied, compare to other people.

Such a beautiful human being you become, that you respect yourself and you respect others.

A new civilization has to come up and it’s working out more in your country.

Russians, people use to be frightened of them. Now the situation is very different. Russians are now loved by everyone. Because, there are so many Sahaja yogis in Russia, who are very deep and mature. Not so many in other countries. They have so many [UNCLEAR]

I ‘m very thankful to you and to all of you for inviting me to this conference so that I could talk to you and to people, who are of science.

Like a blind man whose eyes opened, he sees everything for reality. In the same way, you see everything all types of miracles as reality.

And this is going to happen to you all tonight and also later. Thank you very much.

I think I should give Realization. Talking is talking only.

You have to have proof of what I’ve said, but if you have come here to criticise and is your mind in the opposite direction, it will be difficult. So tell your mind, to keep quiet.

All of them have got it already. Now, I have to make one humble request, that please take out your shoes, if possible.

Because this mother earth helps us a lot. Put Both your hands towards me like this and both the feet apart from each other. Just now, don’t ask, why. I’ll tell you later on. Only have pure desire in your mind, that you should get your enlightenment.

Little higher –{for hands’}

Now you can close your eye and ask a question in your mind not loudly. Mother am’I a Spirit? – Three times.

Now see, if you are feeling a cool or a hot like vibrations on your fingertips.

Now, raise your left hand on top of your fontanel bone area, it was a soft bone in your childhood and bent your head. Don't touch with your hand just keep aloof and move it up and down and see for yourself, if there is cool-breeze or a hot breeze like vibrations coming out of your fontanel bone area?

Now please have the left hand towards me and bent your head again and see if there is a cool or hot breeze coming out.

Now put both the hands towards me, again and open your eye.

Put both your hands up and ask a question; any one of these three questions, you ask three times,

Anyone -“Mother is this the cool-breeze of the Holy Ghost ?”

Second One - “Mother is this the all-pervading power of divine love ?”

Third One – “Mother is this the ‘Paramchaitnaya'? Ask one of them, three times, in your heart.”

Put your head Up and ask this question. Now please take down your hands.

All those who have felt, cool or hot breeze on their fingertips or on their palms or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. I said both of your hands. I said this is what it is- Russians. I bow to you all.

You are my own, my own children. May God bless you. Thank You.

Sahaja yogi- Everybody has it.

Shri Mataji-All of them.

Sahaja yogi - Sahastra open.

Shri Mataji - You saw?

Sahaja yogi -Sahastra open of all.

Shri Mataji -You saw it?

Sahaja yogi -Miracle photo.

Shri Mataji -Show them.

Shri Mataji - Where will you show, where is the screen to show. You show them, I’ve seen them all.

This is the proof of there is all-pervading power. I don't do anything. It is this all-pervading power, is trying to prove ‘Me’.

Sahaja Yogi- I want to thank Shri Mataji, The storm of applause which has last sounded, gives me the opportunity, to thank Shri Mataji for the interesting and rich rapport, which will remain in our hearts.

I’m a physicist, that’s why I had like to start my presentation with the words, which were pronounced about physicists and specialist in natural science.

While discussing the idea of ‘The Truth’, it was said that every scientist is searching the truth in his subject - a physicist in physics, a chemist in chemistry.

From this point of view me and my colleague, co-author of this report, Mr Shipov are wrong physicists.

We never were searching the truth either in physics or in natural sciences in general.

We were looking for the knowledge in Physics, realizing that the Truth is much higher than physics and natural science.

All this work is based on fundamental, the work which has been carried out for the last 20 years is based on the fundamental ideas, different from the cores of so-called this, phenomenological theories, which starts not from nature, but from the starting presumption, which adequacy cannot be proven, as a rule.

In the works of my colleagues, Mr Shipov, it was shown that apart from the four obvious interactions in nature, there exists one more known to mankind for a long long time.

Besides strong interaction – within the atomic nucleus, strong interaction. Besides weak interaction which defined electronic disintegration of the nucleus, apart from electromagnetic and gravitational interactions, which are known to us from the school. There is one more interaction, one more field which is called ‘Torsion’.

The theory of electromagnetism was started with simple tests, when in ancient Greece they were taking an amber comb, using it to comb hair and drawing a bit of fluff.

This experiment defines the age of electromagnetism. Ancient Chinese manuscripts were found and they are dated the 6 -7 years before B.C. though the people with the [UNCLEAR] looking for water. Yes, looking for water. 6-7 years Before Christ. At that time the humanity practically used the torsion fields, though the term itself appeared only in 1922, due to the works by Cartane.

It was shown in these works that all the scientific information about the structure of the world can be represented in a very simple scheme, it's known from the school.

Everybody knows, Hard substances, liquid and gases. In the middle of the century, we found that the elementary particles of plasma. And after that in the thirties, it was the work by Einstein

Physical vacuum

Particle or plasma

Gases

Liquids

Hydro substances

The works performed by Mr. Shipov proves, that there is a higher level of matter organization, which got the name of primary torsion fields. It appeared that from modern science, the higher levels cannot be described, using the language of formulas.

And all of them were united in a general group, called ‘’Absolute Nothing’, the matter which gives birth to everything and absorbs everything. We could call this ‘Absolute Everything’. Now I would like you to remember the table of Alice Bailey, which gives the structure of different planes.

Many remember that Bailey ‘s table contains 7 planes. The lowest level is the Physical plane, which consists of 7 sub-planes in its turn. I’d like to draw your attention to the fact, that three sub-planes fully coincide with what you can see here.

At that time science already knew hard substances, liquids and gases. And further on, there are four sub-planes, which were not discovered, they are called by her the fourth Ether, the third ether, the second and first ether.

Now we can state that science can define these ethers, that is to show what it is, at least some of them. The fourth ether is, what we called here ‘plasma’ (see the table). The third ether by A Bailey is the physical vacuum. The second ether by A Bailey is the primary torsion fields in these structures, the fields which are connected with consciousness.

Before I start speaking about first and second ether, I had like to say something different. It is not by chance that I have just mentioned that we were never looking for the ‘Truth’ in physics. We understood, that, when we have to get some new knowledge from physics and that knowledge is limited. And secondly, we have to show, the place of our new knowledge.

And here we say, that the modern science was able to disclose the content of the fourth, third and second ether. But the modern science cannot explain what is the first and second ether and all the planes of higher level.

We have all the ground to believe that the modern mathematical apparatus has exhausted its capacity, moreover, new non-binary logic is needed for new discoveries.

And many scientists' think that all their discoveries are their own creation.

More than five years ago, Roger Penrose, an English physicists theorist published a book. As far as I know, he was not familiar with esoterics. He was only dealing with mathematics. He published the book ‘ New mentality of the superior'. In this book, he analysed the knowledge - where new knowledge is coming from. He made his analysis based on strict modern mathematics and physics.

The conclusion he made was quite unbelievable for such a person, as he was. He said, that, we can not understand the proof of theorems and laws, do we have the capacity to understand where the new knowledge comes from? Only in that case, if we assume that somewhere there exists the data bank, which accumulates all the information in full volume on everything; and it is only unclear, as it was put by Penrose; " where from and how this knowledge comes to the minds of scientist?”.

I think that any esoteric could explain how it works?. As a result, we have to agree, that if a scientist received an idea, it means that he was allowed to get his knowledge.

And if some scientific ideas come across any difficulties, it only means that either it will not be possible to understand this knowledge now, or that this is not the right time for this knowledge, it’s too early.

One can say that in the framework of the theory of physical vacuum, many results are not simply scientific but technically concrete. Not only theoretically, but practically it was comprehended that torsion field play an important role in the consciousness. One could tell about this for a long time, but I had like to give only one example.

There is a device, which has the size of two cigarette boxes, there is a metal furnace for melting the metal. Moreover, this furnace is grounded and the electromagnetic signal cannot go inside the furnace. I switch on this box and after the melting is over, we found out that in this volume the structure of metal has changed.

I couldn’t achieve such a result by electromagnetic waves, even if it was not screened. Moreover, I changed the structure of metal 100 kg in volume, bearing a tool which consumes less electricity than a lamp of a pocket flashlight. This is not an experiment, this is a technological patent.

Then I invite to the same laboratory, a person with an open channel or an open vision. He sees this experiment and he understands what this device radiates and what happens with the metal, when it is affected by this device. Then the person is offered to do the same, the way he has seen it.

After this is done, the following result is clear, the metal has changed its structure, but the mechanical characteristics have improved by 10-12 %, then in the case with the device.

This is a real example of what can be achieved in physics with the help of subtle energies, which are called in physics ‘torsion fields’ both by a device or by a human being.

Now I had like to tell you about one more result, very important. Even before the war, it was discovered, when nobody pays attention than when one takes a picture, no matter what or whose, torsion fields or subtle energies cause changes of the structure of the emulsion. And it is possible to say exactly what is changing there.

They changing the spinning structure of the film emulsion. And it doesn't affect the visible image. Secondly, in our country, they found 6 researchers who could get different images working with the same equipment, different from other people.

To understand

And it is possible, to understand those structures in the shape of balls, lines and other complicated structural formations are photo registration of the torsion field. But there were some strange situations, if a person has as well developed vision or open channel, then while taking pictures, some field structures appear on the photo.

And if a film made by an ordinary person on the same equipment, who doesn’t have all these qualities, then the picture doesn’t show these torsion field structures. So in no time, we could guess that a well-known technical principle is working here.

When a picture is shooting by a person with corresponding qualities, then in the course of picture taking the emulsion will absorb both; the conventional field and a torsion field from the source of photo object.

And if simultaneously with this, the support signal as engineers say, coming from this person is also absorbed, then visualization is taking place. The best result was achieved by, Mr.Karpov more than ten years ago in our country.

This is the image of a person in the course of an active meditation. You see that there exists a brightly expressed global structure of the torsion field – subtle energies. There are three streams one of them is coming from the person himself and two parallel streams.

In another condition, we can see two spiral structure, left and right very similar over the actively working apparatus.

Another picture-activity in nature [in the video].

Active work in the open, during the work on the channels, we see, what kind of a structure appears over his head. This is the photo of the group of people who are in the process of a group meditation and we can see that a group of people is creating a collective field which is vividly expressed and is a collectively explained and now I liked to show something unique in my mind.

Shri Mataji in the process of work. Here you can see structures which were never ever observed. It is probably that, they reflect primary torsion fields.

One more citation –Another picture

Shri Mataji in the process of work.

I had like to say the following

Maybe the level of subtle vibration so high that it is impossible to reflect the structure of this energy formation, on the level of the substance of all the matter and I had like to say subtle vibrations were so high that it is impossible and lastly I’m very sorry that the projector cannot show all six pictures in succession. I’ll change them. In the beginning of the work all looks like an ordinary picture.

Second picture -The second picture shows the changes, in the field situation present here. The marking point is the bench and its stripes. The changes of the spinning structure of space is so strong that if it had not been for the bench then it would have been very difficult to identify with all the rest on the picture.

Third Picture - It is more deeper penetration. The changes of the structure of space is so strong and so deep that, we can see that it changes at the space itself, as collective fields of the source, which are connected with the people, who are standing behind Shri Mataji.

Fourth Photo - The changes in the space structure, deep structure in the next phase is even stronger. You can’t see the bench itself, but you can identify the centre and if you look hard, you will see a vivid face. There is a bright image. I think it would be nice to ask Shri Mataji whose face it is.

Whether this is the image of the participants of the meditation or this is the projection of super-plane?

Fifth Photo - The last stage of work. Here you can see that the space is fully structured.

Shri Mataji is saying, that, “the space is transformed by this force.”

Presenter says that that the space is transformed with the help of subtle energies-Torsion fields. by the This structural order is reflecting the high level of spirituality, the high potential of her love.

But we have to say that the term Torsion field needs some explanation. The so-called subtle plane doesn't contain any energy. All the interactions and effect on the subtle plane level is performed by information. But the outcome of the information influence maybe the changes in the energy state of the object of interaction

One more fact is important there is no limit to the diversity of the structural transformations of space.

I don’t say think our collective fantasy will be enough to see, ‘ What structure cannot be realised’; any structure can be realized.

This is another rich structure which is different from everything we have just seen, as an illustration of the diversity which is impossible here.

This is principally a different plane, which doesn’t coincide with the two previous ones. This is another image.

In background, Shri Mataji says, this is the other way round “the other image was of sitting in the heart of the universe.”

As you can see, this is a very rich structure and you can see not only on the central part with a lotus formation, but there are a lot of field streams which can be identified individually.

If we could have more time, then the circle of this kind of information could be enlarged significantly. There is a big library of this kind of pictures. Apart from the pictures you have seen today, there are images which show the fields coming from the earth itself.

In background, Shari Mataji is saying, “this is nothing but vibrations.”

And of course all the method used here, cannot fix all the variants, significant information from all the on subtle vibrations of earth.

You can usually read about the new pathogen relation in literature. But in reality, there are up to ten different in their nature-radiations which differ by physical characteristics.

There could be different types of torsion radiations, one has to think of different regimes of radiations. Some of them have been worked out and are already been used.

[Thank You and praise by Sahaja-yogis.

In the end, Shri Mataji signs some books for the scientist and physicist and guest. She received a gift of Mother Mary with Christ. And the conference ended with a song about Russia.]
