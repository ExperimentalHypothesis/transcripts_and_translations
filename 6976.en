1987-1220 Puja: Attention on Quality, Rahuri, India

[English translation from Marathi] (Sound cloud - Sahaja Library - 1987-1220 Talk 1 at Rahuri (Marathi))

Does having a namesakes, caste and creed have any meaning? Today I am telling you all plainly that you should not (live on) freebies (“फुकटखोरी”). Sahaja yoga is not for such people who are looking for freebies, if you want freebies, you should take another path. Those who want to stay in Sahaja Yoga have to live with self-esteem (“आत्मसम्मान”) and have to show the world that we are self-respecting people. Why take contributions, means what? Should Shri Mataji pay for you all? I have paid for the food for people in Pune. This kind of begging attitude will not work and such beggars are not required in Sahaja Yoga and those people who cannot (use their hands to) work should leave Sahaja Yoga. Your collective state can never improve because the vibrations flow through your hands. When you use your hands to work only then your collective state will improve. Today you have built a temple, tomorrow you will build something else, there you need to use your hands to build them. How many of you came to Pune to work with me? You need to use your hands to work. You need to use hands for hard work. The big people who have come from UN Agriculture (department) have taken shovel and spades in their hands to do the work, but no one came from your university here. You show yourself as big agriculturists. What are you going to do? Only benefit yourselves, nothing more than that.

If a Mother has to say this, it hurts her, she cannot hurt anyone. I need to think seventeen times before saying anything, I can’t utter a word from my mouth. How to tell this to my children? I have raised them with so much love, how to tell them? If I don’t tell you, you will go on rotting, I don’t want you to rot. And from where you will rot and what will happen to you? People will say in the future that there were four-five sloppy people who came in Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji has taken some garbage and has brought together four beggars. Even my husband asks me, have you only brought beggars together? You are using money from home. You need to leave this begging attitude and if you don’t leave it, you don’t have any place in Sahaja Yoga. Please keep this thing in mind. Today I am telling this plainly (“sikshu”). If you don’t keep this in mind then even God will not recognise you as Sahaja Yogis and you will have no place in his Kingdom. I have given step by step attention to you, you have got step by step experiences, you know everything step by step. You know that I am Adi Shakti, for that you can see the photo, you see anywhere, you know it. But you should not cheat me and don’t get cheated yourself. It should not be felt that I have spoiled you. Christ only had twelve disciples, they have moved door to door and spread Christianity religion so much. How many disciples did Buddha have, only two. How many disciples did Guru Nanak have, only two. And today I have thousand disciples, thousands of disciples but of no use.

So you have to leave all the infighting. You should abandon all the animosity between you all, do some collective work. Come on let us make one room for Shri Mataji. Come on start something like this, use your hands to work. In all such work, I have seen that the farmers who use their hands to work, are the best. Their hands are deep (“rutatath”) in the earth, from which vibrations are received which opens up. Women are better is what people are saying. Your women are very smart, men are very useless, stupid headed (“मठ्ठ  डोकं”) they say. They do not have brains, they do not have self-esteem, they say. We are all cleansing ourselves here and they are snoring (“घोरत पडली”). How shameful this thing is and they have very clearly written that we do not want Indian men. Now in front of you there is a question that if you want to remain in Sahaja Yoga and want to grow in it, then the qualities in it should be imbibed, show draw it completely. We are no longer the people of the past, but are in the present, we are starting a new era, a revolutionary era is being commenced. Where are we going to fit into it is what is to be seen. Because Shri Mataji stays in Maharashtra, she comes quite often to Maharashtra, due to which everyone is inactive and because of the inaction people are not able to see.

Then how to find a way needs to be seen, how to go forward, you need to take efforts. I had told that that each one of you should plant a tree (“वदाचे झाड”). How many of you have planted the tree? You said that you will plan hundred-hundred trees. Where hundred, not a single leaf has been planted and you were talking about hundred. You are like politicians while talking, nothing less in that. If Indians start talking then it seems like in reality someone like Shankaracharya has come down (on this earth) or what. But if any work is given, then you feel like not to give, as it is better to do it our self. They (referring to foreign Sahaja Yogis) were in hell, from the hell they have come to heaven and you (referring to Indians) are going from the earth to the hell. Without doing something unique, you cannot become Sahaja Yogis because you have got the light. Christ has said that those who have got the light are not kept underneath the table. Only giving yourself importance, subsist yourself (“निर्वाह”) everywhere and to think yourself as great that we have done this and done that. It has no meaning. Your enlightenment needs to be seen by all. Now this pandal has been erected, this should have been erected by Sahaja Yogis. It does not work for me if it has been erected by anyone who is not a Sahaja Yogi. You carry an umbrella over my head, they can’t even offer Ganges water over my head, I have ascended you over my head. If you offer Ganges water over my head then you will flow away in it, she will not be able to bear it that she has ascended on the head of Adi Shakti. That I have ascended you on my head, so you are talking the liberty to build any kind of roof over my head as you wish, should you put efforts as you wish? I am only going to recognise the efforts put in by all the Sahaja Yogis and I don’t want such things, it gives me a headache (“डोकं जडण”).

All these pavilions (“mandap”) and other things should be erected by you only. You all are Sahaja Yogis, how much appreciation you should have of it. Look at the Ajanta caves, it has been built over by ten generations, built over by ten generations. They had never seen Buddha, in ten generations, one after another generation, third generation, how they have done carving work, how they would have provisioned the stones, you only need to think about it. What belief they had and what big (heart) they had. All the efforts were using their hands and today what you can’t see with normal eyes, that how they would have built in darkness? But they did not have Buddha, so did only Buddha get such seekers and everyone else left or what? Why such type (of behaviour) only during my time, but look at the disciples of the other crap Gurus. They say that they are doing service. Only sing in the bhajan (aarti) “ho sake so sewa humse kara lena”. If you can’t do anything then what service should be taken? At least now please sahaja yogis should do the work of growing these people. Ladies should help in cooking, one chef has been brought, he will do the cooking. Ladies should roll out the breads (“पोळी लाटणे”). You should do some work using your hands. They (referring to foreign Sahaja Yogis) do not have the habit of eating food cooked by a chef. They cook their own meals, they have become Brahmins. And you are giving them food cooked by a chef. Shri Mataji is giving the money, then what! If I say like this then Shri Mataji is asking us to save money. If the money is saved I am going to give it to your Trust only, is it that I am eating it (the money)? The lakhs of rupees that I have counted, did you count it? All attention is on the money, all the attention is there. That is why you are not getting it. The attention should be towards God Almighty. Now these experiences are increasing manifold that I felt it is better tell this (to you all) in Rahuri today. Now send this tape (recording of the talk) to everyone. This is not just for the people of Rahuri or for the people of Aurangabad, send it across India and translate it and send. This is the thing that Shri Mataji is saying that needs to be stopped.

At least stop this so that in the future something can be done. It is complete darkness where this (matter) is concerned. What all you needed has all been given. The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, information about the seven chakras, the power to raise the Kundalini which very few people have, it was not there, that you can in a moment raise the Kundalini. Means, after placing you at such a high pedestal, if any person who has been made to sit on the King’s throne goes around begging taking a bag, then what should be said to him. You only tell me what word should be used (for such a person). I do not have so many words. Earlier the saints have sworn so much (abuses) (“शिव्या”) to their disciples and have slapped them in the mouth, in their face, now I understand why. I have not done any such thing and I don’t want to do it and I will not be able to do it as well. To tell this much only comes to my life. Only I request, that now please accept Sahaja Yoga from your heart. Please do things from your heart, place me in your heart, then only work will be done. I am taking so much efforts at this age from morning to evening, stumbling so much. You all know it, these people (referring to foreign Sahaja Yogis) are on the move, but I am taking so much efforts. Does it befit me when there are so many young people around, you all are young, you are much younger than me, who should take the efforts? We should do something, not bother about self. So please everyone should contribute with their efforts, everyone should make arrangements, should do the decorations. They (referring to foreign Sahaja Yogis) will never call any one for decorations, they have done what all decorations, if you see it you will be surprised. But till today, never have they allowed any such person to touch who is not realised.

Because of these things only, now there is no electricity, the reason for that is you, not me. The reason is that as much is your state, God Almighty will give only that much that can be managed; if more is given then people lose their mind. Still how much you have got, just think about it, how much Shri Mataji has given. How much has been given, how much love has been given, how much has been thought for us even if we have behaved liked stupid, still Shri Mataji has given us so much love, step by step has taken care of us. Where we have had any troubles, our kids have got first class, everything is getting done properly, our jobs have become well, everything is happening as per our wish, we have got money, every kind of happiness we have got, these thoughts you need to keep in your mind. Your benevolence is what I need to take care of and your benevolence is not only in you becoming prosperous, that is not benevolence. Something unique, something celestial has to happen. Jijabai made Shivaji Maharaja so big, she alone made Shivaji Maharaja, I need to make thousands of Shivaji Maharaja. You are all realised souls, in those times only he was a realised soul, but today you all are realised souls and something tangible should come out of it. And caste, creed and all such dirty things should be left. You should come out of all this and free yourself. Seers and Saints did not have any caste, here so many seers and saints worked hard for you and kept and these people (referring to foreign Sahaja Yogis) don’t know much about seers and saints and have never seen anyone like Shri Rama, have never seen anyone like Shri Krishna; for you all how much God has poured (his mercy) here. In this golden country how such people will become like coal? It is not possible. The gold should just be dispersed (“उधळून”), it is there inside. You have not come without your past pious deeds. To be born in this country you need to have done lot of pious deeds in the past. You have taken all your past pious deeds and have been born here. From Machindranath, everyone has taken so much efforts, are you going to waste all that hard work. Today that (hard work) is bearing fruits, today it is taking shape, let people be able to see its form that what Sahaja Yogis are. Infighting amongst yourselves and this and that, you should stop all this and together everyone should stay in a collective manner. 

For money matter, I would say that you should make a committee, every one of you can collectively spend the money, where the money was spent do it properly, keep a proper accounts reference everything about it, I do not want to have the calculation from anyone of you but from all of you. But by doing this fights will begin, you should not fight like this. How do all these people live together, they are from 14 countries, for us it is not about one country, even one village, even one small village, even one family cannot stay together. Everyone has got horns. Even if you have horns it is ok, but you don’t need to use the horns. Then we should be happy, we should achieve top form (“शीष रूप”), in such a big revolution you should penetrate and come out. People should say that these people are something special. Because of this only, (Goddess) Lakshmi cannot be seen anywhere, our hands do not work and all kinds of negativity can be seen all around.  So please people should think, Sahaja Yogis should think that what work should be done by us (collectively), what we can create, what can we do. My lecture, every lecture, every word is a mantra. That you should just accept it within yourself and that will work out within you and you will be able to do many things and show. Tomorrow by your deeds only my name is going to be there, from my work only people tell me that you are Adi Shakti only, means I am a different thing. How this work could be done within you should be seen and when that can be seen everyone will go quite. Today I have deliberately spoken about so that at least some inheritance (“विरस्ती”) you should get, boldness (“धडाडी”) should come and till today all the work that we are doing with softness (“नरमायनी”), then we should stand in front of ourselves and ask ourselves “What have we done till date? What have we got in Sahaja Yoga, your own selfishness? Or have you become altruistic (“परमार्थी”)?” People should ask such question and start getting on with work.

Transcrip of English talk (Sound cloud - Nirmala Vidya - 1987-1220 Attention On Quality, Rahuri)

I’m sorry what has happened about the boy who came here and who created a problem, and there’s another problem with us. So I would like to tell you again that next time when you are coming, please see that you don’t bring anybody who has not done Sahaja Yoga for six years; six months at least. The first one is correct, because in six years also they can be quite stupid. But, but six years, at least if not so six months, you should see to it that somebody has done Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is something as you understand, and you know that it’s something that must achieve your purity. As it is, you know you are coming from an atmosphere which is absolutely anti-Sahaja. And from that atmosphere to come to Sahaja Yoga you have to give up many things. As it is, what I find from this the way people are schizophrenic. So, one has to realize from what has happened that our brains, in that horrible conditions of our country, is complete wobbly and it’s over-shattered with all the conditionings and all the ego part from both the sides. The brain is completely, as we say, has gone soft. And anything that is truth, anything that is light, can baffle, can upset you. That’s why I have been insisting that six months at least one should pass before coming to Sahaja Yoga. They can’t understand anything because they’ve never known these things. I do not blame you. You have never known such personalities. You have never known what is Adi Shakti is. And that’s why one has to prepare one’s own personality by cleansing it, by putting your brains into proper shapes, your hearts into proper shapes.

If, supposing, there is a vessel which is already cracked, you try to pour water in it, it will crack completely. It will be completely destroyed. I have seen people who have come to my Pujas and they just went off, completely, absolutely. They couldn’t bear it. The other way around [round] in India. For them, Puja is the highest. They will not do any other things that you can do. But, Puja part, they know what is Puja is, what it means. This is the big difference. But still I must give you all the credit, that the way you all have come out of that horrible conditioning that you have had, where it is said that God is wrathful and that you have to suffer too much and all this nonsense. So, I’ve heard it many a times from people who came to us: “This is too much. This is too much.” Because your vessel is so small, it’s so crooked, it’s so raw, it’s gone soft, it cannot receive. That’s why six months are at least needed to create that vessel within you.

This restriction I would not put on Indians, but definitely on the Western people because, you know, you must have been great saints in last lives. You must have been great seekers. And you must have been people who were looking for truth, no doubt about it. But when you are born in that country with great venture some [GW: venturesome?] spirit, that we’ll show some results in this, these countries. What I find that all the brain is battered. They have seen to it that all the saints are battered, because saints also are always under attack. So many people got diseases just they were born. They got into trouble just they were born. Then later on as you grew up, the more you grew up in that society, the more you started accepting their ideas, the more you became aware of the nonsensical development. You get filled with that, not only the brain, the heart, the liver, everything.

Like, if you are put, if you put something like a sponge into a dirty, filthy water, all the worms, everything, rock into it. Now you have to squeeze it out, completely take out all that. Whatever traditions you have are finished. Whatever value systems you had are finished. Whatever collective sense you had is finished. Like we can say, we cannot create Abraham Lincoln in America way; we cannot. Why? We cannot create Lenin, enough in Russia. Why? The reason is, when they have gone away, the society that came up, these are the lotuses. But the lotuses were plucked out and now what is left are all worms, and when you are born in that pond you have to become the lotuses, but already they have hit you on your spirit. They have hit you on your brain, on your heart, on your liver.

Under these circumstances, one has to rise and see that if you have to really grow into that new atmosphere, we have to accept each and everything of Sahaja Yoga, try to grow and develop yourself into way that purifies you completely and that the vessel is made beautiful, such a beautiful vessel, that whatever Mother pours in is contained in it and it gives a light. Supposing the lamp has got the container of oil absolutely shattered and broken. What’s the use of putting my love into it? It will never burn. Already there’s such a lot of nonsense in that, that whatever love I put in it will all get mixed up and it will never burn and give good lights. So you have to understand my love. You have to understand your own position and you have to cleanse it. Anybody who thinks this is too much is still, I must say, lacks that purity within himself.

Nothing is too much for a person who is a Realized soul. Realized soul is like the bottom of the ocean. Whatever may be the ocean, the bottom is always bigger. In the same way, a Realized soul has to be. You may increase the size of the ocean, any amount. It becomes bigger and bigger. On the contrary, I have seen that slightest thing here and there upsets you. You get suddenly upset, are very upset, for nothing at all. And you think that kind of a fuss is a very big thing. Is not; shows that you are not a Sahaja Yogi yet. If you get upset with small things, what work are we going to do? What are we going to show to the world that we have got Sahaja Yoga, we’ve got our Realization, so we have achieved something great! We have to make great people out of it. Many Abraham Lincolns and Lenin, Lao Tses, Mozarts, all have to come out of you. We have to create William Blake out of you. There were only one or two. I was not present at that time. Still they survived and created great works. In the same way, out of you we have to create these great people. But first you must realize that you have to be absolutely cleansed out and give up all the false, funny ideas that you have.

I was shocked to hear that there was a marriage held in the church by Sahaja Yogis. You shouldn’t do that. And I found as a result of that some people got possessed. What is the need for you to go to a church and get the thing done, solemnized by a priest? Bring unhappiness to everyone, get them caught up. In the whole of France, I have seen only Chartres or that Notre Dame are the only place they have buried no dead bodies. So you go to a cemetery to celebrate your marriage, get your bhoots on your heads and spoil so many Sahaja Yogis. No Sahaja Yogis should attend such marriages. And for what? Just to please some of your relations? They are no your relations. Your relations are Sahaja Yogis and no other relations. You must know that. You have no other relationship in this world, but only Sahaja Yogis. If you try to keep relationships with others, it’s all right to have some pleasantries. You can be pleasant to others, you can be nice to others, talk to others, but know that, that they are not your relations. You are born in this Tree of Life. They are still not on this Tree. So we cannot become one with them. We cannot be identified with them. We need not please them. We should say we do not want to have any such marriages.

Here also I have seen people who go to temple, get caught up because in the temples there are bhoots. They know that. So we have to give up all these religions. As Krishna said, “Sarva dharmanam paritajya mamekamsharmam vraja.” Give up all these horrible religions and religious ideas. They have done no good to you, to the society or to anyone. They have gone against Christ, against Muhammad Sahab, against Krishna, against Rama and Buddha, Mahavira.

You are now Sahaja Yogis and must know that we have to develop as Sahaja Yogis. We have to make our vessel all right. We have to put our self on a pedestal, then onto a hilltop, and there we have to show that we are Sahaja Yogis and what we can achieve. There has to be a kind of a wisdom, a sense, a sensibility and sensitiveness towards all the atmosphere. We must know how far to go with people, how far to say something, how far to achieve something, not to go on sympathizing with nonsensical people. Just forget them. If they have to come, they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.

Also I must tell you in the Heaven there are very few places. Don’t care for the multitudes. Care for the quality. It is the privilege of very few to enter into the Kingdom of God. So forget your relationships and you forget all other people. Get to Sahaja Yoga, get established in Sahaja Yoga and tell them that we have changed our religion; now we have become vishwa dharmis. That will satisfy them that as we have become Christians and Muslims and Hindus, let us now become something else, because now we are not the same as we were; we are reborn again. And that’s how we have to give up all these funny ideas.

I was very sorry to hear that a marriage was arranged like that, without my permission. Nobody asked me. And many Sahaja Yogis went there and dresses were bought for them in England for going to the church and especially dressing up for the wedding. Just, I can’t believe it. I can’t still believe it, but it has happened. Again now it should not be repeated. If you go to the church, your children will be born with some troubles. Then you will come to me. You may not have children; also I’ve seen that. Those who have had, I’ve tried, to attend one wedding like that in the church and I found it was horrid, vibrations were horrid and the lady had to suffer a lot.

So now decide for yourself, no more to please your relations. There’s no need to have anyone connected with you. You can ask them to come to Sahaja Yoga. You can tell them, “This is what we have found. If you want you can come to Sahaja Yoga. But we have nothing to do with you.” Only then you can help them to come out. You have to be strong enough to show them results that there’s something great about Sahaja Yoga, that you are decent people, you are decorous people, a people with great self-respect and a great stability within you.

Also a very common psychological thing I have seen, people start explaining, “Mother, this lady might be insecured.” Nothing of the kind. Nonsense! This is the greatest nonsense I have ever heard. People are insecured about one person and then you say that that person has insecurity. I mean, everybody is feeling insecured about that person. On the contrary you say, “He’s insecured.” This kind of a sympathy shown by a psychologist is all right because he has to get some money out of you. Even if you murder somebody he’ll say, “Yes, yes, it was true he murdered that person because you are insecure.” Even Hitler was quite all right because he was insecure. This is funny, absolutely nonsensical. So we must understand the aggressiveness within us does not come from insecurity, but comes from ego and from aggressive nature. Doesn’t come to us from insecurity. Those who say about insecurity all the time are the people who just want to explain that, “I did it because I was insecure.” No, it is ego! It is horrible ego which tries to overpower others, use others and make them your slaves. Try to understand: it is no insecurity. The psychologists have put all these nonsensical ideas, and some Indians also talk like that.

All these modern ideas, also beware. Be very, very careful. The way they have been implanted in your minds that it is we have to be very sympathetic, there’s nothing like good and bad, that everybody is perfectly all right, all these nonsensical ideas we should not have. We must know that there’s something very different. Those who are good are good, and those who are not are horrid, not because of psychological reason but because they are basically horrid. And we have nothing to do with them. They are evil, and they are evil geniuses. We should not be sympathetic towards them at all. Those who are evil, are evil, they come to Sahaja Yoga also they’ll be thrown out, thrown out permanently.

So do not takes sides with the evil people. Do not show compassion to the bad people. Please, try to understand. This is not a place where we have a charitable institution where we have all the handicapped and all the beggars put together, not a charity at all. Let us not be very charitable. Let us be charitable with the Sahaja Yogis and with ourselves. We have nothing to do with such horrible people. They are anti-God, they are anti-Christ, they are anti-Divinity. They are our enemies. No need to have such charities with your enemies. So be careful on that point. And I’m not teaching you hatred, but I am teaching you discrimination, must discriminate between good and bad. If you cannot do that, then you’ll be in trouble. So do not sympathize, do not take sides with the negative people.

Also, the negative people always sit together, I have seen. As soon as I look at one negative, I find ten people around them. Egoists will sit together. If I see one egoist sitting in one place, ten egoists are sitting with him, because they can talk to each other better, you see. One can argue better than the other. And they enjoy that aggression of each other. So be careful. Be on the watch-out. Where are we sitting, between the negative or over-positive? Where are we? We have to be in the centre. We have to be in the centre. Are we close to our Mother, or close to these horrible people around us? Must discriminate and find out what is happening, where, what is.

Do not get identified with anything, with your country. I am not identified. To me, Indians or anybody is just the same. Just to say that you are the visitors here, as they call it, “guests”, to you I would say call them “foreigners” because guests can be otherwise, also. So we have just a demarcating line, just to understand, that’s all. But means nothing to me. To me, all of you are born out of my heart. All of you are close to my heart. And you are not to feel, in any way, in any way, dejected or rejected, till you find I tell you that you have to reject these things. Unnecessarily don’t torture yourself and don’t make yourself miserable. You have to be happy people, joyous people. You have to give joy to everyone.

May God bless you all!

English translation from Marathi (Sound cloud - Sahaja Library - 1987-1220 Talk 1 at Rahuri (Marathi))

Shri Mataji talking to another Sahaja Yogi in Marathi: Bring me some room temperature water. Need some water. See the light (electricity) has come now! The reality is in front of you. And for you I had to shout and how many more times I have to shout, you tell me. I am afraid to talk in Marathi, what will happen if the light (electricity) goes again. If I start speaking in Marathi then probably the light (electricity) will go. By Grace of God in whole of Maharashtra, Shri Vishnumaya’s power is there everywhere. You have got electricity, everything is there, but what you have you should be able to assimilate and if you assimilate you should at least be able to digest it. Otherwise you will overturn, is there any meaning (to it)? 

Now keep your attention towards me. During the Puja, keep all your attention towards me. Now all these people (referring to foreign Sahaja Yogis) know all the songs (bhajans). I only have now printed the song book and everything else and I will give you each in Pune. You should read all that, read, see how everything is in order. Then you should learn it and should be able o sing with everyone in Ganapatipule. At least you prepare something and come. They have prepared themselves for all the Ganapati songs and they will sing and you all will be silent, it will not look nice. You should not move your hands while sitting, giving bandhan and all is wrong. When I am sitting here what bandhan are you taking, my bandhan is already gracing you. Did you not get it, that giving bandhan, raising your hands, does not look nice at all, like mad. You should be smart, potentially prestigious. Each one of you should be dignified. Now you will say that Shri Mataji we are all simple people, but from simple people we have brought out extraordinary people or not. You only need to prove that, everything has been taken out. You have everything power, everything else, I don’t need to tell you. You have everything, only you need to use and see. Ok. 

Today I have made special preparations, let us see.

Shri Mataji speaking in English: Today I have prepared myself specially. I must say Aurangabad puja was very great. I must say that it might have helped you all quite a lot and let’s see today. One thing nobody should feel guilty, whatever Mother says that is a mantra. She is correcting us. That’s all. 

Shri Mataji speaking in Marathi: She is cleansing us from within, only this much you must remember. You should not feel bad about it and if I have done anything wrong, you should not think about it. Now call small boys and girls and keep this in front. It is going to be difficult to keep my feet in this. I will keep it in this. Now you can take. Now call the children and here you should pour it in the middle of the leg.  

Shri Mataji speaking to another Sahaja Yogi in Marathi: There are joiner (“जोडवी” – could also be shoes) and other things kept in my room, can you bring them here? 

Shri Mataji speaking in English: Now remove this, I think better remove because I think when you take the photograph, this looks very funny.
