Shri Rama's birthday, Rama Navami, Chelsham Road, London (UK), 2 April 1982.

Today specially I'm talking about the Vedas and these havanas we do. When we do the havana it is a Yagnya. Yagnya means "by which you know". Yagnya. And this is done where you use 'Svaha' as the word. That means you use the principle of fire to burn off all that is wrong in you - 'Svaha'. And you awaken it by taking the different names of the God. It was very much invoked when Rama lived and they used to do Yagnyas at that time.
Today is Rama's birthday. The reason was that the people had just started realizing that there is something higher and you have to worship that higher Self, and they thought that the best thing is to do Yagnyas. On the left side, of course, the people started the worship of God and the dedication to God and all those things, that is "Bhakti" (devotion), but mainly what they did before Rama was the Yagnyas, the Vedas, with which they prayed to different elements. Elements have made our chakras, and they tried to evoke the deities of the Elements. But actually it amounts to the same thing.
So as a child Rama was studying with a very great saint, Vishwamitra and he had an ashram where Rama and his brothers studied and they used to come for holidays to their father's place. Then he had the capacity to kill a demon with only one arrow. One arrow of Shri Rama's was sufficient. And he was a small little child, say about seven - eight years of age and people were surprised how he could do it.

Now these Yagnyas were created to evoke the deities within the spinal column actually. And for these Yagnyas they used to sit down and do all these havanas the way we do it. But at that time the Rakshasas would come and try to spoil the Yagnya. Because Yagnyas are to be done with a pure heart and with cleanliness and with purity.
It should not be insulted. There is a protocol about it. While they thought that if we insult the deities there then the deities will disappear and their Yagnyas will be spoiled. At the time of Rama also there were some Rakshasas who took a special pleasure in spoiling these Yagnyas and Rama as a child would go and protect the rishis from the demons. And the demons would take on some sort of a funny form and come like miserable creatures and put some bones of animals and things like that in the Yagnya and that would spoil the effects of the Yagnya. And Rama would protect that, as a child. Imagine, as a child he used to do that. They would be doing the Yagnya and he would be sitting outside with all his small brothers around him and they would kill the demons who would try to destroy the Yagnya.
This is the early life of Rama in which you see how as a child also he showed an amount of expertise in arrow and bow. So any time you see a statue, how to make out if it's a Rama statue is to see if there's an arrow and a bow, then it's a Rama's statue.

Now, his coming on this earth gave us the development of the right side and so the Yagnyas were also on the right side.
Because first of all when human beings came on this earth they were frightened of all the animals who would invade them and all kinds of horrible Rakshasas and all those people, and negative forces would trouble them. In that state they needed to create a king, a ruler, who was an ideal king and who would rule according to the laws of dharma. So he was the one in charge of that. He was here in Treta Yuga and Krishna came at the time of Dwapar Yuga.
When I came it was Kali Yuga but now today the time is of Krita Yuga. The Yuga where work will be done - Krita Yuga. This is the time where work will be done.
So far things have moved from one to another. Now in the Treta Yuga when Shri Rama came, the idea of kingship and rulership started, so the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill of the people. The people had to have goodwill, for the people and for the king, and for the betterment of humanity. The will. That is the right side. So how to create the goodwill? First the leader has to sacrifice and show how far he can go on sacrificing to keep the moral and the goodwill of the people.

So the right side was created by the advent of Shri Rama because he showed a path of creating among people the awareness that they should be ruled, that they should not be anarchists. There should be one head who should be able to organize, coordinate and work out a collective thing.
You see, when we think of a king we want to oust him because we don't like the idea of being ruled by him, because he's not a good king perhaps, or he doesn't represent that will of the people which is a common will, which creates a king who rules for the maintenance of that goodwill. See it as a symbolic expression of your "goodwill". So when you create a law, it is also the expression, common expression, of all the common people, of the common feeling that they should abide with law. It doesn't come to you that you are a slave, or you have to be dominated, or you have to be put down, but it is only your "common will" which is good.

The desire of all the people which is the good, the righteousness, incarnates as Shri Rama and He looks after that will. Because supposing an individual starts saying that "this is not good, this is not good", an individual might take a different attitude about these things. But you must have a symbol of that goodness placed onto someone. And these symbols were created to symbolise your righteousness, your sense of good, so that you can be saved yourself.
Supposing today somebody comes and hits you. Now you can feel how bad it is to be hit by someone or murdered by someone, so you decide there should be a law protecting you. But tomorrow you may do the same thing, but what you do, is to take out your goodwill and represent it as the kingdom or a king or a governing body. So, the governing body represents, should represent; also it's both ways, it's not that it always represents. It may not at all represent. It may not, possibly. But the government should represent the good in you, the purity in you, the pure will to be good, to be protected and that you also should abide by it. It's a very mutual thing. But what happens as soon as you start making someone like that, or appointing someone like that, as usual he goes into an ego trip. Simple thing like that. Absolutely a simple thing. Ego trip. The government gets into an ego trip.

People get amazed how people behave. They'll elect maybe a Prime Minister and suddenly you find the Prime Minister behaves like a brute. You can't understand. You've elected somebody like a Prime Minister thinking that he will be good to us. And then the revolutions take place and people revolt, fight it out. Again the will of the people fights it and makes it alright. So we have to have something absolute, because all these values are changing every moment, isn't it? We think that this government did not do so well, for example. So, we want to demolish this government. Then we bring another one. We find the same thing happening. See, whether we bring a communist or we bring a socialist or we bring a democrat or we have a monarch. Whatever you may have, but still what happens actually is that all these things that come up and go away, all these changes that take place go on creating a feeling in a man that he should be anarchist. Why should we have any government? Why should we have any king? Why should we be ruled by anyone? Because you find the person who's ruling is not up to the mark and he's just trying to deceive you. At that point you have to have some absolute standards. If you have an absolute standard then you can always judge that this king is deviating from the right path, is not doing what a king should do.

A king has to be like Rama. He has to be like Rama.
Representing your will, your goodwill, your sense of proper judgement, fair play and righteousness. If the king is not righteous then your collective goodwill will go against the king.
Now, I've seen say for example in France. We had one kind of a Prime Minister. He did lots of things which were not good so he was thrown away. So you had another one. Now he's doing another thing so he's going to be thrown away. And we are just playing games you see. First of all we have Labour Government. We don't like it. So then we have another Government, Conservative Government. We don't like it so throw it away. We go on playing with it all the time. But in this relativity we are improving. Definitely we are more aware, understanding the value of these people, and also the public is understanding. But then when too many such people come in who are negative they also bring down the will, the collective will very low. And people start identifying themselves with these aristocrats or those people who are ego orientated, who have no moral values, who have no fear of God, who deny religion, who deny evolution. And the Government starts behaving in such a manner that you are amazed that how this is the Government. Like in Chile and Argentina, the way the Government is behaving and is putting down the people. All these things are happening, you don't know. It's such a relative terminology. Like El Salvador. You don't know what to do over there now. Whom to support? Whether to support the Americans or to support the Russians and all that.
Now under these circumstances a Sahaja Yogi can stand and say now, should we join this or that? All is a wasteful thing. It's just a game going on. Let them break their heads. They are good for nothing, useless people. So you cannot solve these problems and you are not supposed to solve them. They must get their realisation and establish the Kingdom of God. So really Rama rules on this earth and not these horrible kings who change their morality every day, those whose will is for something materialistic.
Like now in our country (U.K.) we thought we would have Mrs. Thatcher. Good, very good. She's coming up well I should say. Certain good things she is saying, like self-restrain and all that. She's talking good things, but what about herself?

Shri Rama not only propounded what was good but he followed that. He sacrificed for that and he established his own symbol as a pure symbol of that righteous will which is within the people, which is the collective righteous will.
Now, for example, you can see clearly how the ego-oriented things work out, first of all by the misidentifications we can have. Now if you're a communist you cannot have compromise between democratic methods and communist methods. They think, if you have to be this you have to be absolutely this. If you have to be that you have to be absolutely that. But in Sahaja Yoga what you find is that both are integrated because you have the complete capital and you have to distribute it. This is the complete integration here. All these 'isms' are experiments of the artificiality of the mind. Just a projection of the mind. Whatever is man-made is artificial, but you know that. But what God made is all integrated, whatever you have within yourself you must give it to others.
Now see for administration also what happens after Sahaja Yoga. Say, I am your Mother, here sitting down. You like me to guide you. You like me to govern you. You like me to correct you. You like me to scold you and to even go on to see that your life improves.
Supposing I say "Alright, I give up. I don't want to talk about it."
You'll not like it. None of you will like such a situation, where I say, "Alright you are a gone case, I have nothing to do. You get out." No-one; nobody will like such a situation. You want me to govern you. You want me to look after you. You like that, automatically you have started liking it. There's no domination, but you want my domination. You want me to dominate you. You want that all my desire should be dominating. Automatically. Why do you feel that it is alright, it is very good if Mother takes interest in me, corrects me, it's a privilege. Why do you think like that? Because by that there is a general good created. Because you have become integrated, your body, your mind and your soul, all of them think the same way now. They all want the same. There's no difference. Once there is integration you'll find that Sahaja Yoga is the easiest way to live. But if there is not, then it is difficult.

If you are a lazy person, for example, or you are a very hot tempered person or you are a sort of a dual person, or you are playing tricks with yourself, you are playing games. Then you won't like Sahaja Yoga. As long as these situations are in you, you will not like Sahaja Yoga. But once this situation is overcome, then you will like it, because then you will know that whatever is good for your Spirit is for the well-being of you all, and of all the people. Once this well-being comes in, everyone feels absolutely nourished and fresh.
So the governing part is enjoyable. The connection part is even more enjoyable and that you are in the attention of your Mother is such a great feeling within yourself that "yes, nothing will go wrong with me, She'll look after me." She's there to look after you. But this integration part comes very late because of Ego problems.

You have built up egos because of wrong type of people administering you. From your childhood, you might have had bad parents who never talked of God, of good things of life. They themselves did not lead a life of sacrifice. Very self indulgent parents can create a problem like that. They never gave you the right type of life, a proper value system which should have been there. They never educated how to enjoy righteousness, virtues in life. Possibly, later on the country in which you are born, the other people who surround you also might have done that. Also, your government, whichever you have known must have done that. So when these things change, when you find that you have achieved that kind of integration within you that whatever your body likes is for the good of your Spirit also. Like say for example, I don't like certain things myself. I don't like drinks, I don't like it. Nobody can tempt me. I mean no question of temptation, I just don't like it. I will hate the things which are really bad for my Spirit. Automatically. I don't have to tell myself; it's just there. To tell lies I don't like, because it harms me there. I don't like it.

Whatever is good for your Spirit will automatically work out as soon as this integration takes place, and that is the work of Sahaja Yoga today. That's why I said it is Krita Yuga, is to be done. And this integration must be achieved within ourselves, so sometimes you have to make your body come to this level. May be you are under the influence of some bhoots. Your body doesn't help you. Little bit of tapas or penance is needed after Sahaja Yoga to make this possible and then once you start enjoying, then you like it. Like driving a car. In the beginning it's difficult. Or swimming. Anything, when you try to do it, it's rather difficult in the beginning. If I say forget it now, whatever you have done in the past, now forget it. You have to get to the new things now. You have to do it. So you have to put your mind to it with all your full zest.

That "Alright, if my body's not helping me then I'll try to improve the body because I'm not the body. If my mind is not helping me, I must improve my mind. If my intellect is standing in the way I'll have to put my intellect right because after all I have to be integrated. If I am not integrated I'm not going to enjoy anything nor am I going to do anything good to myself or to others. So why am I here? Why am I trying to destroy myself?"
But when you are disintegrated you'll be surprised. Your one action will destroy your second action and your second action will destroy your third action. When you are disintegrated.
I'll give you an example. Supposing I am sitting here and somebody tells me that this will burn you. This is my own maya, but the body wants to burn itself. It says: no, don't listen to this, just go ahead. Now, when I say this it sounds absurd, but say, the mind says you should not take to alcohol but still you'll go to the pub. Then you are disintegrated. Gradually once you start listening to your body too much, your mind gives in. It just gives in. In everything that you do, if you are integrated you'll be amazed that you'll really become dynamic.

Integration is nothing but your complete connection with your Spirit. The Spirit starts flowing into you. In every walk of life you'll be amazed how dynamic you'll become if you're integrated. Just the connection is to be absolutely achieved with your Spirit. Whenever you think of something, "Is it good for my Spirit?"
Some people have a habit of thinking that spiritual life is such that you hang by the shoestrings somewhere in the air with no connection to the day to day life. So many people think like that. They think that such a man should be a thin, miserable creature hanging onto some tree or something, and should be absolutely in a paranoid state, who is frightened of the whole world, who cannot talk to anyone, who is so much exclusive that he becomes a recluse. These absurd ideas are to be given up by Sahaja Yogis. You have to be very much there, absolutely there between all of them, but somehow you should be rare, a different type, a unique personality. You are to be there with all these things that are going on.

Now people are frightened even of Sahaja Yogis. They see somebody negative, they say, "Oh no!" Now take a fight with that person. Take a fight. How could you dare to do this, such a thing? You are a Sahaja Yogi. Come up. What do you mean by this? You have to fight it out. As long as possible you should try to salvage a person. Talk to him in that manner.
The other side of it is that when you talk to others, when they come to you, then there has to be a kind of a tremendous sincerity. If you are doing things with that sincerity then people will know. When you talk to a person they should know that there's sincerity, that your heart is there. For example, you may talk to that person very sweetly but your heart may not be there and the person might think, "Oh, he was just giving me a lecture." But if you talk to someone with sincerity you say, "How could you do such a thing? Can't you see yourself? Can't you work it out? That's what it is. You are here for that."
Now in saying so, your sincerity, which is coming from your heart is to be seen, and that's what is Shri Rama's character.

That he was on the right side of the heart, which means the heart put to activity. Do you understand that, where Kabira has said, "I will make the compassion of my heart (mana) steady and put it into five elements." *
See in the same way when you are in the left heart then that's your 'heart-felt' thing. But the heartfelt thing, what's the use, you see. There are many Sahaja Yogis who really feel that this world is horrible and something must be done, Sahaja Yoga must be brought in. But how many of you are really putting that into action, absolutely into action?
Without that, your Rama's Tattva cannot be improved. Rama's tattva principle is only improved when you put all the things into action; that exactly Shri Rama did.
So in the ascent of man, when he came up to Rama's place, the advent of Rama was not in the centre, but on the right hand side. He moved aside. So much so that he forgot about his past. It's never mentioned that He's an incarnation. He never told His father. He never told his mother. He never told anybody that He was an incarnation. Of course it was evident that he was. His brother knew about it. Now he had two brothers. Very interesting. I mean he had other brothers also, but Bharat and Lakshmana show the two sides of a human being.

One was Lakshmana and he was a fiery type, you see. He couldn't bear anybody misbehaving towards Rama. He couldn't bear anybody talking in a very mundane way to Shri Rama and he used to get so angry with all these people that he would just come out like a big thunderbolt on anybody who tried to say anything about Shri Rama, even Parshurama, who was a contemporary incarnation of Shri Rama Himself. He is the Shesha as they call it, the serpent which sleeps on the Bhavasagara, on which Shri Vishnu rests. The same Shesha had taken birth as Shri Lakshmana.
Now for a western mind you see, if you talk about snakes they only know the Adam and Eve snake, that's all. They don't understand anything, and they can't understand why people worship snakes. You see, snakes like the cobra and all that are like the kings of the underworld, and Shesha is the one who supports the whole universe. So this Shesha is worshipped as the cobras are worshipped in many villages in India anywhere today. Because they don't trouble anyone there. Because they are worshipped like deities in India. Sometimes they do, but mostly they don't bite a good religious man.
There's a story of Sai Nath where a snake charmer was given a lot of money just to kill Shri Sai Nath. Because in the night Sai Nath used to suddenly go up to his own swing he had made about twenty feet above the ground. God knows, nobody knew how he used to get up there, but they would find him sleeping there. So the snake was taken by this snake charmer and he put the snake on to Sai Nath. And Sai Nath talked to him and He said, "Oh God, you've come here to meet me after such a long time. What is your job?"

Snake said, "This horrible snake charmer has asked me to bite you so I've come to tell you to be careful about these people."
The snake charmer was looking with amazement that he was talking to him! Sai Nath said, "Alright, you go now."
These are age-old snakes you see. So the snake went and bit the snake charmer. But then He came down and He sucked his poison and threw it away. "Because, after all," He said, "the snake is angry with you because you tried such a trick." So He sucked it. That's compassion. And He sucked his venom out and the fellow was completely changed and he said, "Now I'm going to announce it to all the people that these Brahmins wanted to kill Shri Sai Nath."
And why? Why were they so frightened of this man? He used to live outside the village. They were frightened of Him because they were doing all wrong things in the name of God so they were all frightened that they'd be exposed.
This is what it is, that He sleeps on the Shesha and Shesha is the one who is sometimes expressed in Sahaja Yogis, I have seen as anger, when you try to be unprotocolish or when you try to be funny or you don't behave yourself. That's the Shesha in them. That is also sometimes needed. You have to be a Shesha sometimes, otherwise people will start misbehaving, and by that they will be harmed. Not that I will be harmed, but they will be harmed. So that kind of temperament is also needed.

But the other one is very interesting, is that of Bharata. Shri Rama bestowed the kingdom on him because of his mother's agitation. He didn't know what to do so he went back to Rama and he said, "You take back your kingdom. I don't want anything. You are the one who should govern. Why should I have it?" So Rama said, "Alright, you just be there in charge of the kingdom. I have to obey my father, I have to obey my mother because I have given them a promise."
So another great quality of Shri Rama was that once a promise is given, it is to be kept. This is another quality that we have to have, that if you have promised anything you have to keep it. If you have said, "I will do this.", you must do it. You should not find out excuses to avoid it. It's an absolutely anti-God activity, to avoid doing things that you have promised. Your deities will never be happy. You must see that whatever you have promised you must do.
Now when Bharata was sent back by him he said, "Alright, give me your sandals which I'll take there and I'll use them as a symbol of you being there." And Bharata put those sandals on the throne and he ruled that kingdom and looked after it.
Though when he was going to see Shri Rama, Lakshmana saw him coming and said, "Look at this! He is coming to invade you now. He has thrown you out of the kingdom and now he's coming to invade you."

And also among Sahaja Yogis I've seen that this is there. That the Sahaja Yogis who are like Shesha cannot see the goodness of other Sahaja Yogis who are very good people, extremely sacrificing, nice people but their intentions are not understood, are misunderstood, which is a very sad thing. You must see the intentions also of another type of people who may not be so hot tempered, may not be so much angry but their intentions are very good. They have come actually to ask for the sandals of Shri Rama.
So among these two types of people, I have seen there is always a misunderstanding going on. So both the types of people should try to understand that we both are needed for Sahaja Yoga. I cannot only do with one type of people. We have to have both types of people who will look after both the styles of the thing.
But when you are dealing with others, one should go as one. For example, if a person comes to Caxton Hall and he says something, then you should weigh it whether he's a new one or an old one. If he's a new one then you must show all gentleness, kindness, all kinds of exterior things which will please. The reason is that he's not a realised soul. He doesn't see your subtle thing. What he sees is what you are. Outside. How you are dressed. How you talk to him. How you behave towards him. All these things they see first of all. They don't see what you have got inside. They can't see your heart. They can't feel your vibrations. So you have to be very kind to them. You have to be very sweet to them.

I received a letter from someone saying that the Sahaja Yogis have been very rude to me and have been angry. Like the other day somebody came and was sitting at the back. They are trying to salvage the people who are lost by the cults. He was sitting at the back and I said, "Come forward." And when he didn't come, you said, "Get out." You shouldn't say that! Let me say that. That time you should keep quiet. No-one should say, "Get out." Because, you see, the thing is if you say, "We don't care for people who are not humble", then they are going to be lost anyway. Let us give them a fair chance to come into Sahaja Yoga first by your behaviour.
Now, some people have a habit of talking to them a bit too much. They should not talk. That's one thing I feel. That while giving vibrations and all that at the most you should ask, "Are you feeling any cool breeze?" Very humble.
And this is another quality of Shri Rama, is 'Sankocha' ( ). There's no word for it in the English language because you have formality, which is a very insipid word to describe Sankocha.
There is no integration between your heart and formality. But if you can think of a formality of the heart then what do you call that? Sincerity is different. I mean in action. Sincerity is an abstract thing. How to say such a thing? Not honesty. These are all abstract words. In action. For example, I am sitting. Now you may bring me a broken cup, alright, a little broken, or you go to somebody's house, so if an Indian is there, I don't know about western style, - then he'll eat and drink, he'll not say anything. But may be somebody might say that it's broken.

Or say you go to somebody's house and you don't like a colour scheme or something. So for an Indian person it would be not proper to immediately say something. For an Indian. You see formality of the heart is not to say something in such a way that you touch the wrong side of a person, is Sankocha.
Now to such an extent Shri Rama had this that there's a good story which is described in the Ramayana written by Tulsidas. Although he was not a realised soul he has brought out some points very well. He says that Shri Rama was shooting the arrows against the heads of Ravana and he had ten heads, and he had a boon that for every head that fell off another head would grow. He had a boon like that. So his brother said, "What are you doing? You know that he cannot die by shooting the arrows at his head. You have to put it in his heart otherwise he will not die." So the Sankocha comes in and He said, "See. In his heart he has got my wife because he loves her and she's sitting in his heart. How can I hit him in the heart? She'll be hurt." See the delicacy of his understanding. So the brother said, "Then by hitting his head is he going to be killed?" He said, "You see, once his attention goes towards his head his attention will be withdrawn from his heart and once the attention is withdrawn, my wife will not be there any more. Then I'll hit him and I'll kill him."
So see the Sankosha, then you will understand that how we are rude and arrogant. You see, this kind of arrogance and rudeness comes to us because we have no Sankocha. We should not say everything to everyone. We need not. Should we say everything?

Say, for example, in your puja may be you are doing something which should not be done. I know it's wrong. Unless and until it's absolutely wrong I'll not tell. I'll sit quietly. Because otherwise you become tensed up.
So you see, that Sankocha, that understanding comes, if you love someone and understand them. Now, you have to love all the seekers of the world. They have done wrong. They have done all kinds of ego-trips. They have made all kinds of mistakes but, your Mother loves them and you have to love them.
If they are to be corrected I'll do that. You just don't do that way that they feel hurt. Put a Sankocha. While talking to each other educate yourself, train yourself to say things which are sweet and nice, which will make another person feel that this person is a properly brought up person in the Sahaja Yoga tradition. So we have a Sahaja Yoga tradition in which when we speak to each other we have that Sankocha within us of Shri Rama.
And if you do not have that Sankocha you get the right heart and that right heart is a very dangerous thing in a country like England where the climate is so bad, because it gives you a horrible thing like asthma. I'm not frightening you but it's true. You get asthma if your right heart is caught up. Not necessarily that asthma comes from right heart only. It can also come from centre heart. But if you get right heart you definitely get asthma.
So the attitude you see, like towards your father. I've heard people talking to their fathers also in such a funny way. You can't talk to your father like that. They talk to me also very rudely, I've seen, Sahaja Yogis, shockingly even sometimes, on a very mundane level or you can say in a very unprotocolish way. You get this due to the right heart problem.

So this Sankocha one has to learn, the 'maryada' means the boundaries of your relationships. You see, that we love each other doesn't mean that we go on aggressing other's privacies. To what extent we love each other doesn't mean that we go on in a way that we try to transgress all the beauties and all the privacies of another person.
Say, someone walks into the bedroom directly, it's not the way a Sahaja Yogi should do. I need not tell you, but you must knock if you have to, and knock at a time when you need it. All the time to knock or to hang onto someone all the time is not proper.
The Sankocha is a complete cultural style. So we have a cultural tradition which we have to learn from Shri Rama. He's known for his Sankocha, he knows every time how to say things. We have to have this very much engrained within us. The children are to be educated in that way, and once they are educated in that way they will learn the Sankocha. And that will give them a proper understanding of social life.
Like if you see this light is here. If you put your finger to it, it might burn. Then you may remove your finger. But if you are with another person and if you try to take liberties with that person then a day may come when that person may misbehave or harm you or do something to you. Still you will not realise that it is because you have no Sankocha that it has happened.

So this Sankocha has to be worked out very beautifully in every way. In thanks-giving, in accepting somebody's gratitude, in expressing your love to another person in a way that is a Sankocha.
Now Shri Rama is known for his boundaries. He doesn't cross the limit. The other day I told you about food, that you don't cross the boundaries of food, like being compassionate to the bugs and to the mosquitoes. You see in the same way in everything 'discretion of the heart' should be there.
There's no word for discretion of the heart in the English language which is 'maryada'. Discretion of the heart. Is to understand. For example, that if you are rude to your father what do you gain? You gain nothing. But if you are humble you might gain, alright? Even if he's a bad man, because what happens in reaction? Psychologically, supposing you are the son of a father who is doing something wrong and you are obedient to him, he will always have a fear that he will lose you if you follow him in your ideas. So by that humility you will raise him.

If you are humble, if your behaviour towards your parents is like Shri Rama's, there's nothing to lose.You don't compromise in your principles or anything. In day to day things, like if your father is sitting - I mean in India, if the father is there you won't sit down. Before him you won't sit, at any cost. Till he tells you ten times you won't sit before him. It helps, you know. It reacts on the father that supposing I misbehave my child will not respect. So the sense of respect also comes from your heart. That's only possible if you know that maryada from heart - "how far to go". What is the need to be rude to your father? No need, at all. At any cost. What is the need? Or to your husband or to your wife? Why say anything harsh to anyone? What is the need? What are you going to gain out of it? By saying anything harsh I have not seen that people have improved. Only when a guru is harsh or when a mother and father are harsh to the children it helps. Nowhere else it helps in common relationships like brothers and sisters. It does not. In higher and lower relationships the lower persons have to bear the harshness of the elders if they want to improve. There's nothing, after all they're not going to throttle you. Supposing even if they say something bad to you it doesn't matter.
Alright? And one has to remember what Christ has said, that you have to turn the other cheek. So use the heart's discretion about how far to go with a person. In the effect of it you'll be a very, very powerful person, in your family, in Sahaja Yoga, anywhere.

Those people who are obedient to me are very powerful Sahaja Yogis. You know that. And those who are not, go down very fast.
I try to save them by everything but I've seen that those who are disobedient, who don't listen to me, who are rude to me, who do not understand the protocol go down very much in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely like that. In a second I find they are going hundreds of feet down. It's true. Because what is lacking in you is the discretion, the maryada, how far to go. And that's another thing where we have to educate ourselves.
So the education of Shri Rama as I told you was that he could kill a demon with one arrow. You don't have to beat them a hundred and eight times. One beating should be sufficient. But you have to be powerful people and the power of a person increases by putting maryadas. Supposing you have wheat and just spread it, it will spread all over. The birds will come and eat it up. But if you put it in a sack it will have a weight, it will have a size, it will rise in height and it is useful. It will have respect. But the thing which is spread all over, which has no maryada will never be respected. Nothing works out without maryadas. Even the light keeps to a maryada.

You have to keep your maryadas. That is part of our training. Say there's an aeroplane and it is not bound by any maryadas, it is not bound. When it goes up in the air it will be all finished. All our ideas of freedom are to be bound by maryadas. If the freedom has no maryada it is abandonment. It is nonsense. It is not going to help.
So we have to create out of Sahaja Yogis great politicians. It has been predicted, that if Sahaja Yoga does not spread then the third world war is inevitable. People will suffer a lot with a third world war. It is possible to avoid it if people take to Sahaja Yoga in big numbers. But if they do not, there will be a third world war and the effects of that will harm people so much that ultimately it is the Sahaja Yogis who will be called for a conference and not the diplomats. The Sahaja Yogis will be consulted, and they will decide what is to be done for the world and they will become the rulers of tomorrow's world. So we must have a full idea of how to be rulers like Shri Rama.
We have to move very far with ourselves, training ourselves, educating ourselves, getting rid of our egos and understanding that we have to grow. It's a very big task, it's a great task and sometimes you might think, "How can Mother expect us to do it?" But I think that you are the people who are chosen for it and you have to get to it and work it out. So we have to train up ourselves to be first good rulers of ourselves and the rulers of others. First we must learn to rule ourselves. You see, here in this body only you learn how to rule yourself.

Comfort; if you get fond of comfort, make your body work it out that there's no comfort needed. If your body indulges into too much eating or anything, make your body learn that it's not good to indulge into it. If you speak too much, talk too much, if you are rude, just say that, "I'm not going to say a word from morning till evening."
So the Tapas, the penance time is now ahead of us. With that penance the greatest thing that is going to help is to go and talk of Sahaja Yoga. Give the message of my Advent and also talk about how the transformation, the blossom time has come.
This you have to do, plus you have to learn how to rule yourself and then how to rule others - through your heart and not through your mind. You have to rule through your hearts by learning all the qualities of the heart which I have just told you.

I think you'd better read some of the prophets. You will also start talking like them. You read Kabir. Khalil Gibran, all these people. What is Blake? He was a prophet too. You can talk like him. Why not? He talked through his Spirit, isn't it? Pure intelligence. Then you become Shri Rama if you can do that.
So today's a great day. I'm happy that you all could come. And it has worked out so well that I was going to come here and talk about Shri Rama, and wish you all that you follow Him up. Respect yourself and it's your responsibility to be good. To be like that. Work it out that way.
May God bless you all!
