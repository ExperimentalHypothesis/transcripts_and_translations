Interviewer: But the medical science can’t find a way to cure and people being died.

Shri Mataji: They can’t find it, they can’t because they go from outside in and I am from inside out.

Interviewer: You tell me, you warn people in USA who did you warn of the people in USA?

Shri Mataji: Everyone! On the television; in 1974.

Interviewer: Where did you go and what did you said?

Shri Mataji: San Francisco.

Shri Mataji: I warned it on the television.

Interviewer: Yes, What sort of thing did you say?

Shri Mataji: I said there is evil is coming, if you follow those immoral things, in the media I can’t say this thing very openly. The way you are following sexual and nonsense, you are going to have deceased.

Yogis: 86 last year.

Interviewer: Do you think you can cure people with AIDS? Do you still believe it possible?

Shri Mataji: Possible, Yes, I can bring down to the minimum of minimum where there is not sort of dangerous.

Interviewer: What can you tell people to do?

Shri Mataji: Get realization first. This is important. We have some people who may be giving up by AIDS with us.

Interviewer: Do you believe it may cause more people to come to be control because of that, a hope to survive, you know those people with AIDS are no hope. Are you going to give them the real hope to survive?

Shri Mataji: You see, the thing is such people is hard to have a real power not to go back to the same style. But I have cure one, definitely he is very sick, he is completely cured. His father can prove he is cured and then he goes to the same style, he died. So naturally you feel frustrated, you work on a person everything, you worked out they do not take it seriously, my main interest is to give realization. With that you get cured. You get cured very well.

Interviewer: If somebody, man or woman, man and wife is not getting married or not prepares to get married would they get realization or there is something?

Shri Mataji: No, they should not be admin about anything. I would not be married. I would not do this, I would not do. That gives you a will power, which is very strong and you become a very self-orientated people. Just don’t care. “I don’t want to marry; I don’t want to do anything”. About marriage like that the balance is there. Wife gives the balance, she said: Oh you are working too hard, she is the one brings the balance isn’t it? Because you are single you can do whatever you like by yourself, there is no balance on you, you can destroy yourself. You can take to drugs; you can do whatever you like there is no balance on you.

Interviewer: I can’t find realization. Do I need to be a happy person to get my self-realization? Do I need realization? A lot this people around me they feel realized and tolerance completely, of course they may be angles.

Shri Mataji: You are maybe getting little numb.

Interviewer: Numb?

Shri Mataji: I am sure it will work. You have to come to the meeting, I see you. A little liver problem, no problem. This problem here[Right vishuddhi]. This problem here[front Agnya].

This three problem are to be attended.

Interviewer: Not medical problem?

Shri Mataji: This are medical problem.

Interviewer: I could go to a doctor to get a prescription for it.

Shri Mataji: No, they would find out what’s wrong with liver but they couldn’t find what is wrong with this tissue[Right vishuddhi] and here[front Agnya].

NO CLEAR

Interviewer: Just a general, I just ask for you visit in the Austrialia, you will be speaking tonight, How long would you speak, what sort of speak?

Shri Mataji: I will speak for about a hour or so at the most and I try to give realization in a group. Realization must be faster.

Interviewer: That would be tonight.

Shri Mataji: Yes tonight, I am sure you will get it.

Interviewer: IT is expensive business for you to travel around.

Shri Mataji: Oh, no nothing else it is.

Interviewer: You know the people you find people are giving you sometime.

Shri Mataji: Not to me, sometime they do, sometimes they do give to the area, they pay for the travel people before, I don’t take but my husband support a lot. But sometimes they feel mother should not pay for salvation; so we pay to the area [not Clear], people. I don’t know how much they pay for.

Shri Mataji: You know you never know. You may be the person who takes that. You may be the person who saves them. You seem very interested everything is quite a lot. First time I am meeting somebody is interested in finding out what is it this is. But rest is not at all interested.

Interviewer: Thank you and thank you for all your time.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. May god bless you and may you get your realization. He says he haven’t got it but he will feel it later. How about you? When do you feel? hello?[Mother is talking to another technical person]

Technical person: Same they way, not yet, no story.

Interviewer: Much patient for the close.

Shri Mataji: But You feel the change? You feel the change?

[Chatting time not clear]

Shri Mataji: I am also busy as you[haha], I didn’t get your name. I must get your name.

Interviewer: Andrew, Shri Mataji, we just need couple shots, other shots. It is raining, can we take a little shot? Just couple of photo-shot When it is raining? It is too wet for everyone to sit down.

Photographor: Actually we wonder if two of anyone who want to sit down?

Shri Mataji is coming to the camera.

Interviewer: Ok? This is quite Small.

Shri Mataji: Is coming again?

Interviewer: I am alright.

Kids is talking.

Shri Mataji: He is real a big man.

Interviewer: I have a nabhi Chakra?

Shri Mataji: He thought we must be mad [Laugh]

[ not clear]

Interviewer: The people who Australia who may not hear of you and they are obviously don’t know what is your generosity, general philosophy?

Shri Mataji: I think God has given them precious form, which form are much better than Christ have in this days and one could inform everyone. It is media can help.

Interviewer: You are talking about media.

Shri Mataji: Yes, That’s very good.

Interviewer: I am just ask, ask you those who following you think about what do they have to do, what commitment they have to make?

Shri Mataji: They made no commitment but to themselves. The thing is so far it has never been such as a-mass realization to people, that you feel your spirit, once you feel your spirit, that becomes your guideline, then you commit yourself to that spirit which gives you real knowledge about everything, For example once you got your realization, you start feeling the cool breeze on your fingertips you said. But actually all your sympathetic nervous system centres get enlighten and they give your messages on that you know what’s the matter with you. Supposing somebody is suffering of a very serious disease, he may not know it until he diagnose it, gone into it or until you are absolute died case sometime. By this you can be immediately conscious you have this problem and if you know how to correct yourself, of course that also you have to learn, then you correct your physical being, you can correct your mental being, you can correct also your intelligent, you can correct your ideas, you can correct your conditioning, you can correct your ego, that is you become yourself. You aren’t reacting to something, but you react to yourself. You become yourself, you know what is yourself is and a part of that you all commitment is to your peace and your joy.

Interviewer: The faith, is it a matter of faith.

Shri Mataji: No, not at all, it is an evolutionary process just like nature, you see like the tree comes out of mother earth, and now they maybe flowers. They may be fruits the same way. It is the time have come for human being to be fruits. It is just an evolution; it time is such.

Interviewer: Can you, are you assigning that people can be aware of their spiritual problem,  physical problem. You are not saying, will be a sort of being themselves cure their physical problems?

Shri Mataji: No no not necessary. Once you get your self realization. It gives the light you just supposing I am carrying the snake. There is no light. I think it is a rope. When I get the light, I see the rope is a snake, I throw it away as simple as that.

Interviewer: Now I see you talk about form of yoga. To a lot of people yoga means a physical mental of realization, but doing a lot of yoga posts and exercise. It is also part of it?

Shri Mataji: It is very dangerous because there is no science inside of it. They don’t know where to use which yoga. It is just such as taking all the medicine box into your stomach, that is how they doing in the modern. Yoga because it is very half baked ideas, we do use it sometime. It is yoga or physical science sometime if there is a kind of obstruction, a physical obstruction in the particular charkas, we do use when it is necessary and for what charkas it is necessary.

[not Clear]

Shri Mataji: You are taking contracture of destruction.

[not Clear]

Shri Mataji: You see I don’t know why we are more about people who has sort of competitive experience in their lives, something you see there is a big mystery, you can defeat you enemy or you can destroy them. You see all sort of, very kindly you should go to the church now thing is that. And it is all they are using lucky I should say.

Interviewer: It is more realize?

Shri Mataji: And they take a lot of money of it, for it you cannot take any money.

Interviewer: Yes you said. It is a lot of people.

[not clear]

Interviewer: You are right.

Shri Mataji: It is very seriously people don’t understand the serious thing of this situation, man should understand the world of collapse. The whole world is kind like people are not mature, even the age itself becomes sort of margined down, it is not all right. It is not the way you can solve the problem, you have to get to the point, we should find out the solution. [not Clear]

Interviewer: Sort of being? [not clear]

Shri Mataji: 1 year before he got. Could be a disease Could be done by anything, Could be define by virus?

Interviewer: The virus?

Shri Mataji: Virus disease. It should be a virus.

Interviewer: I just need to put the earphone on.

Interviewer: Do you have a feeling that the virus could be cured?

Shri Mataji: I could be feeling a little bit on the people I work on themselves also.

Interviewer: Because it is immoral? Do you think it is immoral?

Shri Mataji: Yes, of course it is kind of immoral and the morality is sitting on ourselves. Morality is not suffering which tells us wisdom and give us great sensity.

Interviewer: We are sitting in the land of innocent?

Shri Mataji: You are sitting, because you see after all it’s death spirit is doing [not clear]

And it’s stick to your part, it is purpose to be there, that is why that is the purpose. I tell the doctors to go down to find out the place, but they are afraid to do.

Interviewer: Can we move to there?

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Interviewer: I would like to go through the, what I would call would be the cool breeze experience. What would that actually mean? What would that signify? When you are feeling the cool breeze?

Shri Mataji: Yes, actually you are surrounding by the all-pervading power. If people don’t like the way it calls. I would say the nature has a subtle energy within itself, which you can call the all-pervading power. That can explain why you have we say vibrations in matter. [not Clear]

And this divine power is exist you must accept me as a divine, that is how very closed it is to you, that you accept that. You are not aware.

Interviewer: Yeah, sorry it is that the difficult magnify station of Holy Ghost? Does those people understand that?

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Interviewer: Do you believe I can feel?

Shri Mataji:Yes.

Interviewer: Alright, I understand the right hand is action, left hand is the hand of desire.

Shri Mataji: Emotion.

Interviewer: Could you join me in doing that? I am knowing a little bit about that. You hold me left hand like that?

Shri Mataji: You just put your hand towards me. But if you can take your shoes stand on the mother earth that would help.

Interviewer: Why? That is important to take of shoes?

Shri Mataji: That’s the mother earth that takes away all the problems.

Interviewer: It sucks all right?

Shri Mataji: As long as you do it.

Interviewer: What should I do next?

Shri Mataji: You see, you are being ego orient, you are being a right side person.

Interviewer: I am just a reporter.

Shri Mataji: Whatever you are. Man are always right side person because are futuristic

Interviewer: Do I just forgive?

Shri Mataji: Just in your heart.

Interviewer: Do I need to close my eyes?

Shri Mataji: No, no, Just say in your heart I forgive.

Interviewer: You want me to say?

Shri Mataji:  Just say in your heart; just say I forgive. It is a very good power it have, very great power. [Not Clear] Now say something, too many thinking also. Yestarday we have.

Interviewer: Potentially do I need to think about,think about anyone?

Shri Mataji: No you don’t have to think,  you are better to get a idea Thinking is a bad idea. By thinking, thinking you can’t relax.

Interviewer: Do you think why I am insanity?

Shri Mataji: No, no, But over thinking is not good, you can’t be healthy. You have to become the spirit. The spirit doesn’t think just see. Whatever you watch you see whatever you don’t.

Interviewer: Can you tell me why the cool breeze is more out of the hand other than anywhere part of the body?

Shri Mataji: It comes out the head now. Do you feel any cool coming out?

Interviewer: No.

Shri Mataji: It comes out of the hand also.

Interviewer: Do you feel?

Shri Mataji: But now the hands are cool. Can’t you feel it?

Interviewer: Would that help if we did... ?

Shri Mataji: Nothing could help. The outside, which is the preserve side called the right side.

You can’t feel it so much because of the nerve takes it you see. It’s numb out. Do you feel relax now? Now watching it without thinking, watching it without thinking. Do that otherwise can’t do it. Watching it without thinking.

Interviewer: Feel the realization?

Shri Mataji: Do you feel that, that is the cool breeze. Maybe you’re confused with other breeze.

Interviewer: I know what you are thinking, I am not. We are the natural breezes that I am not on the other way.

Shri Mataji: You have to do it. I can’t do it because it’s your permition. [ not Clear]

Interviewer: Is there anything to do being relaxed?

Shri Mataji: No. You are actually being relaxed. You got your realization. The thing is when you got your realization, it comes against gravity, because nothing, no any energy shapes like this and move like that, it doesn’t go to the side. When we are not realized, we are going to suck in one side, which creates imbalance.

Interviewer:You say I don’t feel it because there is some imbalance in me?

Shri Mataji: Very imbalance, you got your realized but of that you are using one side too much. And I told them to use both

Interviewer: Maybe have a holiday, do you think?
