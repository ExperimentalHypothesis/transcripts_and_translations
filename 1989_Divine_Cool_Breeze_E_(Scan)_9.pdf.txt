We should be baware, however, because the ego can fool us, even to the point of convincing us that we have vibrations when we don't. Shri Buddha's message of truth is known through our right side, through our attention: We should realize our own "I-ness as Sahaja Yogis, recognizing that we have lelt this universal religion innately and fully believe in it. We must be aware that our lives are for the work of God, and for that we must be pure and watch ourselves. We must not be hypocritical nor cheat ourselves through ego compassion, hard work, dedication and sacrifice taught by Shri Buddha. The trulh is going to make us beautiful." .

Greece, as the center of the Nabhi of the universe, has shown these Shri Athena is Adi Shakti, the One who unites and integrates. To do this, Shri Matalji said She came on this earth in material form in Greece, as Shri Athena, to "oreate an integrated force which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an Integrated force.

The Divine Cool Breeze Shri Buddha Puja Synopsis Spain, May 20, 1989 Shri Buddha was Guatama, who was born in a royal familly and became an ascetic to see mankind's problems arising out of desires. As an incarnatlon, Shri Buddha had to reach His enlightenment so that His whole potential could open out in a diferent way than an ordinary seeker.

The Greeks have an understanding of the Shri Mataji then spoke of respect. Because of the Greek sense of respect, Alexander went to India and grew spiritually. The English, however, were there for 300 years and gained nothing. One must have respect for others, their culture. Once the British sense evolves into true respect, the worlid will transform. We must "positively respect" other Sahaja Yogis. Respect which comes from the heart indicates a high state of understanding of God. We must respect Adi Shakti from the heart, not in an artifical way. respect Adi Shakti as the Deities do. Greeks will lead us in this respect. When that happens, we will be transformed completely. We must learn to On the individual level, Sahaja Yogis need to balance themselves by integrating the qualities of left and right. The integrating force of Athena must evolve within the yogis, and Athena must awaken in Greece; then Greece will be purified and will help work out the balance for the rest of the world.

 6. The Divine Cool Breeze Brahma Chaitanya Puja Synopsis Munich Germany, July 1989 This was the first puja in which Sahaja Yogis worshipped Shri Mataji in the form of Paramchaitanya, "the all-pervading power of God's love." Shri Mataji explained that Paramchaitanya does everything. It is the power of Adi Shakti and contains everything within itselt. It may appear separated or dislocated, In the same way as we feel that there are differences between countries, but it is actually continuous, working within itself. It pays special attention to Sahaja Yogis; whatever is desired comes from the Paramchaitanya if we are one with it. This formless energy has all the intelligence, coordination and organization, and above all, it is the love of God and the love of our divine Mother. To become one with this Paramchaitanya, we have to become the reality. Shri Mataji explained that others' photographs cannot work out Sahaja Yoga because they have nol become the reality. A painting of rain will not make anything wet, nor can it make flowers grow. In the same way, we must know that in reality we don't do anything, and that everything is done by the Paramchaitanya. A Sahaja Yogl feels this as truth in his heart, while a non-Sahaja Yogi may understand it, but not feel it as part and parcel of his being. The Paramchaitanya is divine love. Shri Mataji explained that to us, love means mad behavior. We love our family, our children, which is unreal and unpredictable. But the Paramchaitanya knows how to express its love, and the essence of love is concern or Theet," benevolence. appearing cruel or affectionate. It works for the benevolence of the individual and the collective, "and it knows very well what is to be done." It behaves differently with different people. If Sahaja Yogis understand that it is always working for their correction, they will never be disappointed in their lives. Shrl Mataji noted that since Sahaja Yogis have found this Paramchaitanya and the connection within, they should stop thinking and worrying, simply jump into it and become part of this reality. It always corrects us, in whatever form is required, whether Shri Mataji also explained that horrible things have happened in the past, such as wars and the massacres that took piace in Germany, for example, but through them a lesson. is taught which makes us more collective and helps to overcome nationalism and racism. knowledge that something is wrong within us. Shri Mataji discussed modern problems such as AIDS, drugs, poverty and ecological problems. She said that leaders do not know how to solve these problems, and that most people are unwilling to recognize, face and correct their mistakes. In this time of Kall Yuga, everything that is Ignoble, detested and useless becomes good for people After every war there has been a kind of explosive movement toward the At the end of Her talk, Shri Mataji asked Sahaja yogis to pray that "we be more and more aware that we are part and parcel of the Paramchaitanya and we .can feel it, we can use it, we can work it out."

 Helsinki, Finiand 17.08.1989 Devi Puja How to deal with newcomers It is the end of lands and settle in the end. There are so many seekers here so there is more attraction in Finland. all the problems come So, here we for the negative forces to come and attack the seekers. When you Come to Sahnja Yoga, you have to know that Saha ja Yogis shows you gradually everything that you have. For example like the light that In the darkness you are carrying a snake in your hand, which you do not want to throw away. fright, so throw the snake away. the snake has come from Sahaja Yoga. But vhen the light on you see the snake and you get a But somebody might run away thinking that comes SO come to Saha ja Yoga may also be like that and wiil to face reality. So you have to be very patient with them, and careful, for he is coming from complete darkness not know what his mental condition is. Maybe he is half from some horrible disease or has some horrible guru. Or, much that they cannot feel it. So it is very So the people who be upset about themselves. They, will not THEI want and ignorance. You may mad or is suffering maybe they are suffering so complicated. The first principle of Sahaja Yoga is never get disappointed Sometimes I've worked on peopie for twenty hours and found they would'nt work out Just like a stone. At least out of stones I could have created out of all that hard work you put about in Saha ja Yoga. WHatever we we have to do. We should'nt worry about the fruits of it. This the main Principles of Gita. 'Do the Karma but do not worry about the right track. Otherwise you might get you have to work hard. a Ganesha. You may, find nothing has is nothing to feel cOme in. So there to do, of frustated have is one the fruits.' This will keep you on frustrated. Once in Boston they were very worried and asked if all of them will I said that at least you should not give up hopes. intil the them, and it has started working out there. In the the beginning you never get many people. want us to have too many people because there would to be hel11. go end we should try to save way you have the Divine does not many useless people joining us. First of all we have to have real good to know that in same Also be so Saha ja Yogis. And those who call themselves Sahaja Yogis have to build themselves very good Saha ja Yogis. And there are no attention is good. Once they are established, then them. Otherwise if the foundation is up in such catches nothing , and their that they are Manner the whole building on can build up weak, the whole building can collapse. we few Sahaja Yogis. We cannot afford to go there's a flood of people. In Italy seen my face, or knew who I was, but So we have to bave, have LO have many-though you see whenever when I to Milano, they had never I went full. So many thousands of people came that you had to just I could see the whole hall was wade through it. out of all those thousands. Then ten people more, and ten more and that's how it started gathering. you are no good for Sahaja Yoga. the future also. So we got about ten people Because in Sahaja Yoga you have to become. Otherwise

If So, anybody says sonething to yoI have pity on him for he is blind and don't get fanatics against Sahaja Yoga because they are not You have to show your patience and complete forbearance, Its. There may be SOme angry. wanting Reality.You very important not to get frustered, for, whatever numbers we have you should try to perfect, as it will strenghten our foundation, which has to be very strong and once the foundation is strong, you can go ahead with it. To begin with, you should not talk about me much. You should say that at the moment we should't discuss her. Por let us know ourselves, then you will know m understand that it is for their benevolence, their own they you make them fher. If energy their own maneouvering and they should keep it to theselves will be happy. But do not tell them about me mich. Now the mirsculous things of Sahaja Yoga should not be described or talked of. Normally you should show them any miracie photographs. They will always say you have managed it or maneourvered it. You should 1limit yourself to telling about Sahaja Yoga, about Kundalini, know Bot etc. Keep it in a general way. And also everybody need not can tell is about chakras and bos they have about a puja. But what you be kept in balance and you have to raise the Kundalini. And you just say let's use Mothers photograph for the time being but later you don't have Or they will fight for it. to on when you are experts to use Mother's photograph. Then they will never give it up. And thirdly they are afraid of collectivity. So you have to say thet because frightened and if good and righteous people ali not collective we are are we collect together, they wont be afraid of being collective. You see only the thugs and theeves combine. The good people dont combine. So we have to combine. Then they will understand and they wont be angry. Otherwise if you say we have to have collectivity then they get suspicious. As you always see that nobody combines for love. of sinister stuff. of story this love is. If they combine it is for hatred or to fight or some sort If you say we are for love they will say we know what kind If you have to really bring them round through discussion and argument, you tmust first of all be well equipped with the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga. You should be of such a mood and such a state and such a personality that they should see there's something special about this you much better. Do not get frustrated. Its just fun thats all. If we dont get this one we will get another one-it doesnt matter. person. And then they will accept I've been going to countries and countries. The first time I went to Italy, which is today a a big meeting and press conference was going to be held. When we went there there was all things, Went and did all great Sahaja Yogi nstion, I paid for a very big hall where not a single cockroach went to even for the meeting. And before that I of Because we were the only people there the postering. Despite that not a single soul cane. It Was do the postering. I fun, you see, because it happened at that time so today you could laugh. So that is what they will enjoy it them selves. So, all events are importantin Sahaja Yoga because how they will realize 1t later on when they come to Sahaja Yoga doing and how stupid they were, what kinds, they were and they have been that gives variety and an interesting theme. Everything has to be as fun. I wish you people could understand this and relax campletely this point. Never get frustated. If somebody is not alright or does not not get vibrations, you should just smile alittle bit and say alright next time. taken on May god Bless you.

Spain, May 20, 1989
Shri Buddha was Guatama, who was born in a royal familly and became an ascetic to
see mankind's problems arising out of desires. As an incarnatlon, Shri Buddha had to
reach His enlightenment so that His whole potential could open out in a diferent way
than an ordinary seeker. After that, He realized that one must become desireless.
Shri Buddha taught that man's greatest problems come from ego, which leads a person
to extremes. He worked on the Pingala Nadi and stationed Hirmself on the ego to
control it. Christ, Mahavira and Buddha are the Lords, the rulers, of the Agnya chakre,

The Divine Cool Breeze
Brahma Chaitanya Puja Synopsis
Munich Germany, July 1989
This was the first puja in which Sahaja Yogis worshipped Shri Mataji in the form of
Paramchaitanya, "the all-pervading power of God's love." Shri Mataji explained that
Paramchaitanya does everything. It is the power of Adi Shakti and contains everything
within itselt. It may appear separated or dislocated, In the same way as we feel that
there are differences between countries, but it is actually continuous, working within
itself.
It pays special attention to Sahaja Yogis; whatever is desired comes from the
Paramchaitanya if we are one with it. This formless energy has all the intelligence,
coordination and organization, and above all, it is the love of God and the love of our
divine Mother.
To become one with this Paramchaitanya, we have to become the reality. Shri Mataji
explained that others' photographs cannot work out Sahaja Yoga because they have
nol become the reality. A painting of rain will not make anything wet, nor can it make
flowers grow. In the same way, we must know that in reality we don't do anything,
and that everything is done by the Paramchaitanya. A Sahaja Yogl feels this as truth
in his heart, while a non-Sahaja Yogi may understand it, but not feel it as part and
parcel of his being.
The Paramchaitanya is divine love. Shri Mataji explained that to us, love means mad
behavior. We love our family, our children, which is unreal and unpredictable. But the
Paramchaitanya knows how to express its love, and the essence of love is concern or

appearing cruel or affectionate. It works for the benevolence of the individual and the
collective, "and it knows very well what is to be done." It behaves differently with
different people. If Sahaja Yogis understand that it is always working for their
correction, they will never be disappointed in their lives. Shrl Mataji noted that since
Sahaja Yogis have found this Paramchaitanya and the connection within, they should
stop thinking and worrying, simply jump into it and become part of this reality.
It always corrects us, in whatever form is required, whether

is taught which makes us more collective and helps to overcome nationalism and
racism.
knowledge that something is wrong within us. Shri Mataji discussed modern problems
such as AIDS, drugs, poverty and ecological problems. She said that leaders do not
know how to solve these problems, and that most people are unwilling to recognize,
face and correct their mistakes. In this time of Kall Yuga, everything that is Ignoble,
detested and useless becomes good for people
After every war there has been a kind of explosive movement toward the
At the end of Her talk, Shri Mataji asked Sahaja yogis to pray that "we be more and
more aware that we are part and parcel of the Paramchaitanya and we .can feel it, we
can use it, we can work it out."
