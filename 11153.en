I bow to all seekers of truth. At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it. We cannot understand it, we can not think about it and we can not conceptualize it. Unfortunately at this human level, we have to understand that it can not be felt, what is the truth. We have to become something, 'subtler being'. We have to become the 'Spirit'. All the religions have said that we have to be ' born again'. First as human beings and then as Spirit. Now, these are the special days which I call as 'blossom time.' But in our Indian scriptures, it is described as Kalyuga, means the worst times and after that will be followed, Satyuga, 'the age of truth'.But between these two there is another kind of era working out which we call as Tritayuga. This era or this time is very important because in this era all that has been done wrong will be exposed. All those who have done wrong to others will be punished, and all those who are falsely talking about God will be exposed and punished. At the same time, this era has got a speciality. That is, this 'all-pervading power of divine love' will become active and by its activitiy, you will know the truth. Many people will get their realisation through 'Kundalini awakening' and they will get their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems solved. Let us see how it punishes. For example, these people Anglo-Saxons and Spanish went to America and killed so many Red Indians and inhabitants, thousands of them, and occupied that land saying that this is our land. You can not even find one single Indian or Aboriginal anywhere in America, also in South America. Now, these Aboriginals ran up to the very high mountains in Colombia and Bolivia, and in that place, Bolivia and Colombia you must have heard now that they are making the worst possible drugs. These drugs are called as cracks and so many other things and now something latest has come also and that has all got marketed now in America and even in the elite societies in the parties they take drugs openly. This is how they have to pay which is in Tao called as  'polarity' for their misdeeds. In every country where ever they have tried to divide, like India, the British tried to divide us. Divided us nicely into three pieces. Now their own country is getting divided into three pieces and there is always a bomb scare all the time even in the city of London. Such violence is coming back, boomeranging on them. So whatever all we have done to others in a mass scale or individually can be seen today returned back to us. The only solution for this is to ascent to a higher level of spirituality. This is the only way we can achieve a status. As if you are standing in the waters, you are afraid of the waves but you get on to a boat. As it is, it is said that in every class 65 per cent people would be suffering from either AIDS or some secretive diseases or from schizophrenia, madness and so many other diseases. So now we have to be wise as Russians I think, are very wise people to understand that we have to now ascend into spirituality which is a very, very easy thing to do. Unless and until it happens all of these countries and all of these people will have to suffer. All world problems are due to human beings. And all human problems are due to this Chakras and these centres which are within us. If we can somehow solve the problems of our centres and these Chakras we can solve our problems and solve the problems of the whole world.

I will give you a little idea about the West. We have a very great idea about this democracies but they are quite demonocracies. First of all, they are challenged by all these so-called religions. Their faith is challenged. Like Christianity. It has nothing to do with Christ. It is all made up by Mr Paul and his friend Peter. Paul was a bureaucrat and he caught hold of this Peter and re-edited the whole Bible and the idea was brought in which was called as the 'original sin'.That means the relationship between the husband and wife is the original sin. Then why did Christ attend the wedding? Was he supporting the 'original sin'?That means all great incarnations like Shri Rama, Shri Krishna, Mohammed Saheb, all of them were sinners.Except for these Cardinals who have so many women kept as wives. So because of this suppression, people thought that it is too much, they took to another kind of a mental yarn, of Mr Freud. And then they started believing in 'free love'. Also in Russia, there are many people who believe in stupid fellow Freud. And now after so many years received a letter, a book, which says 'fraudulent Freud'.This book says that it had a very malignant effect on the culture and thought of America. Not only Americans, everyone, but worst are the French. In France, there is an unwritten law that a housewife could be a prostitute. Too much of publicity, too much of propaganda by television has really emptied their minds completely. Anything they suggest, immediately these people accept without even thinking. They have no wisdom as you have. Like one nonsense started that you cut all your hair and make a little sort of big growth in the centre, put some red colour on it call it as UNCLEAR..and they all started doing it. I asked them, 'why do you do it, your eyes are becoming blind', so they said, 'what's wrong, they are free to do what they like'.So freedom without wisdom is also very dangerous. All kinds of stupid things they do. Now from India these HareRama people have come, and they have brought 'Geetha' just like these people took Bible.By reading book you can not know the reality. You have to become Self- Realised. It is another state you have to achieve. Now in Oxford street in London these people shave off their heads,  and wearing Indian dresses they can't, and just jumping and everything, sarees falling off. Another one is called Transcendental, Mahesh Yogi. He has made people jump. And they paid six thousand pounds for each jumping of this kind and they all broke their bottoms. All this kind of nonsense they are bringing and please be careful not to get into this kind of nonsense. Communism has done one thing to you, very good, was this that it has taken away fundamentalism.Fundamentalist do not want to have one religion. They want to have many religions so that they can fight nicely. They want to have wars in the name of God. But please try to understand within ours the Universal religion, the Universal being, that is the Spirit. We have to keep our wisdom intact and should not allow anything to enter our minds which is like a publicity or as pressure from outside. These are very very important times. This is the last judgement. You have to decide whether you want to ascend or you want to descend. Sahaja yoga is a very simple innate system. It is just within you. It is your own. Is your own divinity which is manifested, which will express itself, which gives you powers to give realisation to others. You know about the modus operandi as to how these centres work. In India, there are three doctors who have got their realisation and then they worked out and they got their M.D. in curing incurable diseases. There are many Sahajayogies also in Russia and also in Ukraine who have seen how Sahaja yoga helps you to cure yourself. You should not think that your divinity in any way is harmed by whatever you have done because it is eternal. Nothing can destroy it. When you become the spirit the quality of spirit starts manifesting in you. Firstly your spirit, when it comes in your attention, then you get enlightened, your attention becomes active. By putting your attention to someone also you can help that person but if you do not put your attention to your spirit then your attention goes to things which are of no use to you. Your attention not only becomes enlightened but it gives you the 'absolute truth.' We live in the world of relativity but by this achievement, we know the 'Absolute Truth'. We become absolutely peaceful within. So many people have got peace prizes but there is no peace within them. They have got noble prizes but there is no peace within them. So by this happening you become absolutely peaceful with your self.No more conflicts, no more tensions in your mind. Many children who are supposed to be dull in class become extremely intelligent and obedient. By this happening, you can raise the Kundalini of others. You have the full knowledge of your own centres and of the others and if you know how to correct them, you can correct your centres as well as the centres of others. Sahaja is not an organisation. You cannot organize God's love. You have to 'Become'.As you see these flowers we take them for granted, but what a miracle they are. Look at our eyes, what a miraculous camera it is, and look at our brain, what a computer it is. All these things we take for granted. Who runs our heart? They say, doctors say,' Autonomous Nervous System'. But who is this 'auto'? That they can't say. That is this, 'all-pervading power of Divine love', which we have not yet felt. Only we have to feel it. We have to be connected. Once we are connected we become empowered. We get the identity, and we understand that we are part and parcel of the whole. Now Sahaja Yoga is spreading in fifty-five countries and your brothers and sisters in fifty-five countries. Once you become the spirit you will realise that all religions are born in the same 'tree of life' and that people have taken away those flowers from that tree of life and that they are fighting with the dead flowers. Then we realise the beauty of the essence of all the religions. You can feel it on your fingertips, the truth, the absolute truth. This is what is, 'your right to have' and you should have it. But it is not meant for stupid people. It is meant for people who are wise and who understand the importance of their life. As you know there are so many Sahajayogies sitting here, I can see them. Their faces are like beautiful flowers. They were all bubbling with joy at the airport. Others who were there were asking, 'how are there so many in such joy'?This is your right to have it and you are going to get it, all those who are here tonight. There is no end to this knowledge. But one thing I have to tell you that Sahaja yoga works only collectively. It doesn't work individually. It doesn't work if there are groups. If groups are formed then Sahaja yoga goes down. So one has to be very careful not to indulge into this kind of divisive methods. It will take hardly about 10 minutes for you to attain that level of spirituality. But those who do not want must know that I can not force it on you. I respect your freedom. Freedom of your choice. All those who do not want should really leave the hall.( That is, 'Russian wisdom'.(laughing))

So now there are 3 conditions before we start this process. The first condition is that you all should be absolutely confident that you all will get your self-realisation today, tonight. And those who have already got it will get to their higher state. As I told you this is the work of Divine love. So you cannot regiment people, you cannot discipline them, the discipline has to come from within. So this is an 'actual happening' and not the sermon. So the second condition is that you are not to feel guilty at all. If you had done mistakes it's alright, you are human beings. You are not Gods. And no use feeling guilty, if you have done mistakes, just face it. What is the use of putting it here, your guilt? But by feeling guilty, what happens is that this centre here on your left side gets blocked. If this centre gets blocked you can get diseases like angina, like spondylitis, like lethargic organs. So, why to feel guilty? Actually, you should be very much pleasantly placed towards yourself  and you have to forget the past. At this moment you must know that this 'Divine power of love' is an 'ocean of forgiveness'. And this 'ocean of forgiveness' can dissolve all the mistakes that you have committed in no time. So please forgive yourself. Then the third condition is even easier. That you have to forgive everyone. Some say it is very difficult to forgive. It is not, because logically whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into the wrong hands. Those who have troubled you are very happy. But when you do not forgive then you torture your self on their behalf. You should not even think of those people. It is a headache. In general, you must forgive everyone. It is very very simple. Only these three conditions. Also, you have to take out your shoes because your mother earth helps you a lot. Those who are sitting on the chairs have to be comfortable but they have to keep their left and right feet away from each other. As you know that there are two powers within us left and right. One of them is the left side which is the power of desire and another one is the right side which is your power of action. But Kundalini is the power of 'pure desire'. So you have to have a pure desire to get your Self Realisation. I hope you have forgiven everyone. Because the centre here and the Optic Chasma inside the brain is like this, very constricted and if you don't forgive then it won't open. So to open that you have to forgive, so that Kundalini can rise and give you Realisation. As it is you have tortured yourself by playing into wrong hands and now you should not miss your self-realisation which is so important. You have to be very comfortable sitting. You don't have to go to the Himalayas or to fast your self or to suffer. Now will show you first of all what is the way you will nourish your own centres and your Kundalini will be awakened.

First of all, you must put your left hand towards Me like this, on your lap. Then you have to put your right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the Spirit which is the reflection of the God Almighty. While Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost which is the Primordial Mother. If you become the Spirit  you become your own master. So now please bring your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. We are working only on the left-hand side. This is the centre of your mastery. Now please take your hand on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the centre of pure Divine Knowledge. I can not force on you this knowledge. You have to ask for it. Christ has said, "humble in the heart will inherit the earth".So you have to be humble. Now raise your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen again on the left-hand side. Then raise your right hand on top of your heart again. Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right from the front. All of you, raise your hand not on the heart but in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. I have already told you what happens to you when you feel guilty, that this centre gets blocked. So now please take your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head. Please put down your head. This is the centre where you have to forgive everyone in general. Now please take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. This is the centre which is for, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your own satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this Divine Power. Now last centre is very important.  Just stretch your hand fully. Stretch the palm. Now put the centre of your palm on top of your Fontenelle bone area, which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now please push back your hands. Please push back your fingers. Please push back. You will get the actualisation of Baptism. It is not just saying, 'Jesus, Jesus' but actually getting the Baptism yourself. The Christ has said that 'you will be calling me, 'Jesus', 'Jesus', I won't recognise you'.Now press back your fingers and put down your head. It is very important. Now move your scalp..Don't hold your head. Don't hold your head. And move it slowly 7 times. Put down your head. Put down your head. That's all we have to do.

(There is one gentleman who is not doing anything should leave the hall please, with a band. The gentleman with a band, he is not doing anything should leave the hall. You should not watch other people. It's not good for him and for others. The one with the black band. It is not civil to watch others. Here he is sitting there. Further, further. That's the one. Please you can't sit down and watch others. It is not proper. He doesn't want his realisation, he can leave. The only one like that. Don't get disturbed. Don't pay attention that side. Now I have already told you, the ones who do not want the realisation should leave the hall. Why should you be aggressive like that? You have to be humble.)

Alright, so now we pleasantly place ourselves. (laughing)You have to put now your left hand on your lap on the left side.And your both feet away from each other.The ones sitting on the ground can sit comfortably, but you should not put your feet towards Me, that's all.Not towards Me.Alright.Now those sitting on the chairs have to put both your feet away from each other.You have to put your right hand on your heart.Now you have to close your eyes and not to open them till I tell you.Better to remove your glasses.So now close your eyes.Left hand towards Me suggests that you want your desire, your Self-Realisation, and with the right hand, we do the action.So we put our right hand on our heart and left hand towards Me, and close our eyes.Now here you have to ask Me a fundamental question about yourself.You can call me Mother or Shri Mataji.Now you ask a question, 'Mother am I the Spirit'? ask this question 3 times.In your heart.Now if you are the spirit you become your own guru.So now you put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard and here you have to ask another fundamental question,3 times, 'Mother am I my own master'?I have already told you that I respect your freedom and that I cannot force this 'Divine Knowledge' on you.You have to ask for it.So now you can ask 6 times because this centre has got 6 petals,'Mother please give me pure Divine Knowledge'.As soon as you start asking the Divine Knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising.So you have to nourish your hand centres with your self-confidence.So now please raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and here you have to say 10 times,'Mother I am my own guru.I am my own master', say it with full confidence.I have already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this conditioning, this ego, but you are the pure Spirit.So now raise your right hand on your heart.Now here again with full confidence say 12 times,'Mother I am the pure Spirit.' Now, this 'all-pervading Divine power is the ocean of knowledge.' 'Ocean of compassion and bliss'.But above all, it is the 'ocean of forgiveness' and whatever mistakes you might have committed can be completely dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right.Now here you have to say with full confidence 16 times,'Mother I am not at all guilty'.Now I have already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you do not do anything.But if you don't forgive then you play into the wrong hands.Moreover, your Agnya Chakra which is in the Optic Charisma will not open if you do not forgive so you will also miss the chance of getting your self-realisation.So please forgive everyone in general.So raise your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head.Here you have to say, not how many times but from your heart,'Mother, I forgive everyone in general'.Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading Divine power.Now place your hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible.Here now you have to say without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,'Oh Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly.' Say it from your heart, not how many times.Now the last centre is very important.You have to stretch your palm fully and put your right hand, the centre of your palm, on the Fontenelle bone area which was a soft bone.Now put down your head and stretch back your fingers, this is important to stretch back your fingers to have a proper pressure on your scalp.Now, here again, I cannot cross over your freedom so you have to ask for Self-Realisation.Now move your scalp 7 times saying, 'Mother please give me Self Realisation'.Say it 7 times.Now please take down your hands and open your eyes.Now please put both your hands towards Me like this.Now watch Me without thinking.This is the first stage where you become thoughtlessly aware.Now put the right hand towards Me, like this, bend your head and with the left hand, you see if there is a cool or hot breeze like a wave coming out of your head, Fontenelle bone area.Right hand towards Me.With the left hand. Bend your head.Now please take your left hand like this.Now with your right hand, you see.Bend your head and see if there is a cool breeze like thing coming out from your head.Now again once more with your right hand, do the same thing but if you have not forgiven it will be a hot breeze, so please forgive now.Now bend your head and see with your left hand.Now raise both your hands towards the sky and push back your head.Now here you have to ask one of these questions 3 times.Anyone of these questions.' Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?.' or 'Mother is this the Divine power of God's Love'?.or ' Mother is this Paramachaitanya?.' Ask anyone of these questions 3 times.Now please take down your hands.All those who have felt a cool or hot breeze on their fingertips or on their palm or out of their Fontenelle bone area, please raise both your hands.Moscow has become a Moksha now.Completely .,.I bow to you.Your saintly life has started.But you have to grow and I am sure it will work out.We have a centre here and Dr.UNCLEAR is in charge.I already told you that this is the beginning where the sprouting has taken place and you have to grow indeed.Please be collective.Please attend the program that is arranged by Dr UNCLEAR.Thank you very much.May God bless you all.Next year again I will come to Moscow.(Clapping)
