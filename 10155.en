Radio Interview

Interview: You feel it on your hands. You feel it emitting from the top of the head. You feel it flowing over the body but that's not the only thing. This is an outer experience because your central nervous system becomes enlightened by these vibrations but inwardly you start to feel a very joyful person. You start to feel the silence. You know that what is happening inside you is transforming all the things that were negative or undesirable within yourself into something positive and what's more, you can give it to others. And that's the most beautiful part. 

Shri Mataji, you were at the Guild Hall in Derby last night for a meeting there. How did that meeting go?

Shri Mataji: Oh very well. I never had such a nice meeting before in Derbyshire. It was wonderful. People were very beautiful. I think certainly awareness is showing in England which is very promising. I have been here for 10 years and I've been struggling to work it out because I think England is very important, it's the spiritual field. It is the heart of the universe and people have to understand it. And I found this year, it has suddenly taken a new turn in the awareness of people, they are started looking at it from another angle whereas maybe the controversy that is on about the miracles of Christ's life and I'm here to prove that all the miracles were true. Absolutely true. I mean you can prove it. It's very simple to prove it.

Interviewer: We will be having a demonstration in fact very shortly in the program which listeners at home might like to know they can join in with. That is a little later on. We will return to you both in just a few moments. The time in 16 minutes to nine o'clock now. With me, in the studio, we have two people. First of all, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, who is a disciple of a technique known as Sahaja Yoga and also one of its devotees, Dr Warren Reeves. Thank you very much indeed both of you for coming in first of all. You were at the Guild Hall last night and I understand you are capable, Shri Mataji, of giving the crowd the experience, an experience of self-realization on mass.

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Interviewer: Did you manage to achieve that in Derby last night?

Shri Mataji: Very much. We had very beautiful people yesterday and I think 90% did feel it.

Interviewer: How do people react to it?

Shri Mataji: They are quite amazed and surprised because you become so silent, you don't think. So you don't react much but you enjoy yourself.

Interviewer: Now what are the benefits of this Sahaja Yoga? Are there practical benefits to a person?

Shri Mataji: Innumerable because you get connected with the Divine which is the vital force which looks after our mental, physical, emotional being and the whole thing gets filled up with it again. It's like, I'd give an analogy, like a car going and the petrol is about to finish but here something else all the time bubbling in. There's no problem of getting exhausted.

Interviewer: So how does it affect the person? I mean, does it give them more self-confidence or…?

Shri Mataji: No, no. You get completely cured of your troubles, diseases, even cancer can only be cured by Sahaja Yoga, by nothing else, you see. That's what doctors have to now come to. They do not want to compromise with it but it is a fact that cancer cannot be cured by anything else but Sahaja Yoga.

Interviewer: That's incredible. 

Shri Mataji: It is very much fantastic I must tell you that I have cured the cancer of our President of India.

Interviewer: Dr Reeves, have you used these techniques?

Dr Reeves: Of course! Of course!! We've used it so many times. 

Shri Mataji: We have some English doctors here who are using this.

Dr Reeves: I'm Australian but around England for example, there are many doctors practising Sahaja Yoga who cured so many people of really serious diseases but this is the point that the power of God acts. It acts and it acts in a way which heals, which fixes up problems of a physical kind and a mental kind. Because we're dealing in the realm of causes, not treating effects which is what basically doctors are doing.

Interviewer: So to what extent is this whole thing dependent on faith?

Shri Mataji: No, no, not at all. We don't need any blind faith for it. It is like sunshine. I mean you are a human being and you have to become something higher, is your birthright, is an evolutionary process and God has to do it and it is done. There is nothing to believe into God if whether we believe it or not, He's there. So it makes no difference, it's like sunshine.

Interviewer: I'm told it is actually the sunshine actually will work through the radio. How do we go about that?

Shri Mataji: Yes it will. If you people who are listening, look we are listeners if they put their hand towards the radio for example now, both the hands towards the radio or one hand if they are driving, then they will after some time feel a cool breeze coming out of the radio or they might feel the cool breeze coming out of their fontanel bone area which is the soft part which we had as a child. They can put the hand about four inches above their head, the right hand and see there's a cool breeze coming out of their heads. It is to be seen there it's, there's a cool breeze coming out. 

Interviewer: Extremely interesting. I might just mention that this will work actually whilst we're talking so we're not interrupting anybody. If you are trying, I'm actually sat in a rather difficult situation because I'm in a studio which is, has got quite a lot of air conditioning because it's sort of fairly airtight and sound tight.

Shri Mataji: But still their air will work out (?)

Interviewer: I can certainly feel the breeze.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that's it! That's it!! That's it!!! You got it!

Interviewer: To be honest. And I'm wearing informs (?). So, that is or would seem to be a simple demonstration.

Shri Mataji: Yes but now whatever has happened to them you have to know what it is. What this power is. This is your own power and which you can work it out. You must know how to work it out. Yoga means union with the Divine, also it means the depthness or you can say the technique of Divine laws and Divine methods. So you have to know about it. For that, we have here a person who can help you. We have some people who are realized, souls. They got their realizations in London and they know all about it and it's all free. You cannot pay for it. That's the main thing one should know. It's a living process.

Interviewer: So just us (?) go back to the power first of all. Does the power come from you or does the power come from the person themselves?

Dr Reeves: I think I'd better answer that.

Interviewer: Yes. Please tell me.

Shri Mataji: No, no. He will embarrass me. Let me tell that. You see it is your own power we should say, for the time being. Because you see the power that comes to you is the power of God, and God is reflected within you at your heart point. And you have another power which we call as the power of the Holy Ghost which is residual sleeping in your triangular bone called sacrum. Now it rises just like a premium (?) in a seed, like a germinating power. And it pierces through your fontanel bone area where resides, this is the seat of God Almighty on top of your head. So it touches that and that's how you start feeling it on your central nervous system. For the time being, it is better to keep me out. For me, my safety and your safety too because when Christ just said that He's the, He's the incarnation of, He's the son of God or when He said He is the light, He's the path, people crucified Him. So it's better to be tactful with people because if (?) the ego that's challenged suddenly if you bring in a human being you see.

Interviewer: So what are You? You are the teacher, presumably? The catalyst?

Shri Mataji: I think that's the best you can say about me.

Interviewer: Okay now you said you couldn't pay for it but I mean there was a lot of your time and effort and it must be a lot of expenses involved in this.

Shri Mataji: The time is free for me because I'm a housewife and expense also I think my husband is quite well-off and we are paid well and the UN people don't even pay the income tax so not such a problem there but also sometimes you see the people who invite me pay for my travel but they don't pay me they pay to the railways.

Interviewer: I see. You're going to Leicester tonight but I understand that there are regular meetings in Derby, aren't there? 

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes there are. And you have got the address.

Interviewer: The Friends Meeting House and St. Helen's Street which is just alongside our building and it's every Wednesday at 7:30.

Shri Mataji: Yes, please.

Interviewer: Why do you think, yes I think I ought to ask Dr Warren Reeves this. Why Dr Reeves, do you think people might come along? What will be the thing that will make them come or…?

Dr Reeves: I think seeking is there in everyone. So many people have been born today who are seekers and they're wanting something beyond this worrying anxious time that we're going through, the crass materialism. They're seeking something deeper and they'll come. They also will come because they detect the sincerity and the depth of what Sahaja Yoga is and this is why it's spreading all over the world. It's so profound and it's so essential in line with all the teachings of all the great scriptures. In fact, it proves that all the great incarnations were right. It's what Christ described as the beginning of that page of truth which has to manifest in all humanity. 

Interviewer: We ought to perhaps decide whether it is in itself a religion.

Dr Reeves: It's beyond religion. You see religion ties you down. It's a tying down of the consciousness but this liberates you from the need to be tied down. When you're one with God, do you need religion?

Shri Mataji: Now, can I come in? 

Interviewer: Yes, please. 

Shri Mataji: You see within us lies a power by which we have our human awareness and that power is our valency, you can call it like carbon has four, we have ten valences within ourselves. And when these ten valences, what we call the 10 commandments. And when these valences topple down, then we lose our human awareness in the sense we go out of it. Now the people who have worked these are all the prophets who told us that we have to follow this religion but nobody follows religion. What they do is to make a sort of fanatic boundaries for all these so-called religions. I give an analogy to that, this way, that the people pluck out. The plucked out the living flowers from the tree of life and called them mine, mine, mine. And that's how the ugly dead flowers are the so-called outside religions. But the real religion is within you, living, it exists within you. So in a way you get aware of your own religion and one has, doesn't have to tell you, don't do this because you become your own master and your spirit tells you that if you, if you try to do something wrong immediately what happens that you lose your vibrations firstly, and secondly that sometimes people have vomited or they feel uneasy they don't like it. In short, we can say in our awareness we rise so much higher than sin we, we feel within ourselves, sin. Like an animal can feel, cannot feel the filth and dirt as we can feel it at the human level. But at this level, we can feel the sin and we just don't like it and we live in a very virtuous and very righteous life and enjoy our virtues. 

Interviewer: There is a lot to be said for that. Thank you very much indeed Shri Mataji. Thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning.

Shri Mataji: Thank you. Thank you.

Interviewer: Dr Warren Reeves, thank you for joining us.

Dr Reeves: Thank you.
