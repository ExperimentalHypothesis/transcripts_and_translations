Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Athens, Greece, April 25th, 1993 

Sahaja Yogi: We are working very hard there, all of them are working very hard for your coming here, Mother. 
Shri Mataji: Very sweet of you.
Sahaja Yogi: With a lot of love. 
Shri Mataji: Very sweet of you really. Because there are so many seekers in Greece, I was sure about it. You have to tap the real people. And all these false Gurus did not come here, maybe. I don't think they came. Did they?
Sahaja Yogi: Most of them, they were not allowed to come in.
Shri Mataji: Like Rajneesh was not allowed. 
Sahaja Yogi: Was not allowed. Maharashi, something like that, was not allowed. Some other fellow was not allowed to come in. And because Greek people don't have too much money, so these false gurus do not prospect here.
Shri Mataji: So they're not attracted.
Sahaja Yogi: They were not attracted.
[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Shri Mataji: That's very true.
[Someone offers a Coca-Cola drink.]
All right, thank you.

So now what's the program? You tell Me.
Sahaja Yogi: Today Mother, rest for you Mother. You'll be resting and tomorrow there will be by your grace a puja at the new centre. After tomorrow, it's a press day. And Wednesday the public program.
Shri Mataji: But when is the puja?
Sahaja Yogi: Tomorrow. Tomorrow?
Shri Mataji: What time?
Sahaja Yogi: Any time, Mother, You also. After all, night?
Shri Mataji: Whatever suits, I mean, normally, whaterver time I give is that suits [unsure]. It's for you do decide.
[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

It's a fact, I mean, I give you some time, this time they say: "It's the puja." Then I say: "All right."
Whatever 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, nobody called Me. I said: "Now what is it? Am I going to go on my own?" They were preparing, your know, decoring things this size. So I said: "Whenever is the right time, then only you 'll finish, whatever it is." 

I'm not sure I mean right [unsure]. It's not going to work out.
I was just ready in time.
So when you are ready you call Me, I'll be there. 
Let's keep it like that, hopefully. ause I don't want to call you about it.
You'll be very busy collecting everything, hurring up.

Sahaja Yogi: The first time You did one night. 
Shri Mataji: Hum? 
Sahaja Yogi: The first time you came, Shri Mataji, for the Athena puja. We had said in the morning when it was the afternoon, then when You had a rest, everybody slept.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

Sahaja Yogi: And when we arrived to the program, late, how late, just after the puja we went to the program.
Shri Mataji: Just watch out you take it easy. You see, we have to take very easy all these things.Â There should not be any hard and fast rule about it.
I'll have some water.
You cannot make any hard and fast rule about it, that's the point. Just that whenever it is auspicious that works out.
