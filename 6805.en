Talk to Doctors, "Hormones". Derby (England), 10 July 1982.

Sahaja Yogi: Mullerian duct is something new about these two main lines that are in the [embryo].
Another Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it is the, reproducts it and the...
Sahaja Yogi: They reproduce in the kidney, they reproduce and [unclear] I would [unclear]. I have no idea. You see [unclear] in the embryo Shri Mataji, the first thing they develop, it’s very interesting, is the, the brain. Not the brain but the neuron placement. [Alternative] separates to form the spinal cord. Kundalini in other words does [create] that. Not in the spinal cord. What is it ? the neuron, Christy?
Another Sahaja Yogi: Is the neuron tube.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s the, it’s the basis of that, of the spine itself.
Another Sahaja Yogi: The neuron tube.
Shri Mataji: The medullar cord itself.
Sahaja Yogi: Ha, and the segments. And then the rest developments around it, half. But all that endocrine glands come from this reed, this pattern it’s the very interesting.
Shri Mataji: That means that they are from the Ida and Pingala.
Sahaja Yogi: Hmm.
Shri Mataji: They are the stored energy of Ida and Pingala.
Sahaja Yogi: Because it emits two side things afterwards, [none] of them, Mullerian ducts or something like that.
Shri Mataji: Actually, first they are formed, then maintain them.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s right. First that is right, first to do like that, these Mullerian ducts, you know.
Shri Mataji: Why are they [doctors]? Because they are aiders. Energies don’t require [practice]. They emit energy. You see, anything [that is put low as the floor] require the... Actually [doctors] [Hindi] They are energy pockets. And they emit energy, [emit energy].
Sahaja Yogi: The whole thing, yes, but.
Shri Mataji: So these are actually the energies. These are formed by the left and right and central, all of them. And these energy pockets are placed there, close of that. If we go right side, right-sided. If there’s a left side [needed], left side. [I mean if there’s a dirt/dint of right side] they start flowing. Dirt/dint of left side they start flowing. So to have a coil in respect the difference comes. These are energy pockets.
Sahaja Yogi: And another thing, Ma.
Another Sahaja Yogi: In the embryonic stage, Ma?
Shri Mataji: No, no, more they are [beyond this].
Sahaja Yogi: In the other. Even beyond, even beyond.
Shri Mataji: In the embryonic stage these are energies.
Sahaja Yogi: As, as, as pockets of it.
Shri Mataji: In the embryonic stage actually the energies flow in a channel but they do not have that state.
Sahaja Yogi: Right.
Shri Mataji: Now, is the, that... Like a dynamo. They create dynamo, we call them, left and right side can create a [dynamo]. And you can have a battery or something like that it’s reproduced. That’s what they have a battery produced [to send a signal]. Now they become batteries or not that, that’s a dynamo, or something that emits, manifests, like a light.
Sahaja Yogi: Another thing it’s in.
Shri Mataji: Stored up in it. Left and right sided stored up in it.
Sahaja Yogi: You see, and that’s a significant act in the beginning to say also you [pop] the five elements in the neuron tube, three constituting the left side, right side and center and two the Atma and Kundalini.
Shri Mataji: Yeah.
Sahaja Yogi: Which open out, [does use] these pockets and the other opening out is the, is the Atma here and the [seedling] that becoming the grosser aspect [it’s no other than] the heart and the sacrum which is the residence of the Atma and the Kundalini.
Shri Mataji: You see, Atma is [that thing].
Sahaja Yogi: Atma is that?
Shri Mataji: Atma is the reflect, is the object which reflects. This is the reflector. And that reflector is separate from you. And when this reflecting will work out, then the Ida and Pingala Nadi, both of them together, produce these energy pockets. All right? And then keep for the reflector for [its use/its switch]. Then when the reflector is perfect then the reflector is [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: All right. This is the mechanism. This is the machine of the Kundalini that what you can call a tantra. The whole, I mean, the whole chakric system is the machinery of the Atma.
Shri Mataji: Is the machinery of the Atma.
Sahaja Yogi: To work out that reflection of the Atma, protect it and to [unclear].
Shri Mataji: I wouldn’t say, I wouldn’t say like this.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I can see that.
Shri Mataji: No, to do an analogy, we say that energy that is going to flow in this machinery is the Kundalini which is going to work and this energy gets connected through the All-pervading Power, to Atma. So it’s like a plug. All right? Now this All-pervading Power is the power of God Almighty. So we have God Almighty or His All-pervading Power. This All-pervading Power is felt by a plug here which is the Atma, the reflection of God. And this energy, when it gets to the plug it feels this higher energy which is the power of the Atma, of the Paramatma. [Can you cover?]
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Yes.

Shri Mataji: You get something like the Rolls Royce [in you].
Sahaja Yogi: We, just, just, You know, in the simplistic terms, does the Atma actually rise in conjunction with the power that is Kundalini or is it, where is it touched the All-pervading Power this point or obviously this point?
Shri Mataji: [Where it’s perceived?]
Sahaja Yogi: That is [here]. So it rises.
Shri Mataji: But in the human being it [resides] in the heart, of course. It comes out [of this nature]. Sense of reflection, that moves, reflection that moves.
Sahaja Yogi: One thing which is quite interesting, Mataji, that all the hormones that are produced by the Swadishthana, they are all made out of fat. They are all steroids.
Shri Mataji: Now does that explain such a use of the body? This is called as so be in the [Vishnu]. Devi is called as made in the [Vishnu].
Sahaja Yogi: Hmm. That’s right.
Shri Mataji: That She stays, the power stays with the [made up] do not [depart of it]. Now how is fat produced according to the medical science? Let’s see?
Sahaja Yogi: Nicely in the liver.
Shri Mataji: Perfect.
Sahaja Yogi: Formed in the liver and transported out and laid down.
Shri Mataji: But how? How does liver produce fat?
Sahaja Yogi: Of lipids.
Sahaja Yogi: Direct digestion. Whatever fat it digests...
Shri Mataji: Digested by?
Sahaja Yogi: By liver.
Shri Mataji: By?
Sahaja Yogi: Intestines.
Shri Mataji: Intestines. Then?
Sahaja Yogi: Then from sugar also creates fat, can.
Shri Mataji: Hmm?
Sahaja Yogi: Can create sugar from fat.
Shri Mataji: From sugar? Reaction is what?
Sahaja Yogi: Not sure actually. Sugar, which. I’m not sure, Mataji, which is the [unclear]. How does the liver produce fat out of sugar?
Another Sahaja Yogi: By glycemia genesis. It’s a...
Sahaja Yogi: No, that’s the opposite. That’s producing the sugar.
Another Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]
Sahaja Yogi: [That’s getting an invert]
Sahaja Yogini: Why?
Sahaja Yogi: That’s coming back into sugar. I do not know what to. I thought that You know Mother it does it automatically, use the sugar with sugar and does it.
Another Sahaja Yogi: So we’re missing something very subtle.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, is something more subtle.
Shri Mataji: Nothing, it’s very simple, very gross.
Sahaja Yogi: [Try Mother.]
Shri Mataji: Sugar never gets into fat [unclear]. Actually, this is [autonomous] system. Sugar
digests all the fat.
Sahaja Yogi: That is true. When it goes in the worse [cause] the death, sudden death.
Shri Mataji: It just takes sugar into fat. It will never produce fat.
Sahaja Yogini: Never produce fat.
Shri Mataji: It cannot do that so.
Sahaja Yogi: That is true also.
Shri Mataji: Because no carbohydrates. It just have gluten and fats. Is never [carbohydrate]. There’s no carbohydrate. Carbohydrates actually dissolve fats. I will not [percolate]. Creates called diabetes. Is this fact? Have you? Have you ever saw? [Hindi] Just carbohydrates. Achcha, there are those kinds of carbohydrates. Yes? So now, is all right? Carbohydrates? Sugar never gets converted into fat. So [unclear], outside is prepared. So means question [remains Or limit].

Sahaja Yogi: That’s a big one thrown in the [unclear] in the webs and medical science, isn’t it?
Another Sahaja Yogi: No, but the [that’s medical science]. They have to change all the text books now.
Shri Mataji: From where that fat is, that fat is produced in the human beings or in the [animals Or cells?], how?
Sahaja Yogi: By digestion, using sugar as a catalyst [it does absorb].
Shri Mataji: With. But that is [what] source of fat comes from where? For us, and for any digestion [group], so we go into the basic?
Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know, Mataji.
Shri Mataji: There is something converting into fat.
Another Sahaja Yogi: The string of the fatty acids together...
Shri Mataji: Hmmm?
Another Sahaja Yogi: String of fatty acids together with glycerols.
Sahaja Yogi: No, but Mataji is [unclear].
Another Sahaja Yogi: Oh, is it?
Shri Mataji: So what did he say?
Another Sahaja Yogi: Said, polymerized fatty acids with glycerol.
Sahaja Yogi: He’s giving the chemical reaction that produces fat which is fatty acids plus glycerol.
Shri Mataji: No, no, but these people [used it]. What is the reaction you say? Just tell that.
Sahaja Yogi: Just polymerizing the fatty acids with glycerol to get fat.
Shri Mataji: Glycerin. From glycerol?
Sahaja Yogi: Glycerol plus fatty acids.
Shri Mataji: But fatty acids from where do they come?
Sahaja Yogi: Yeah.

Shri Mataji: [If you are getting.] What is the source of fatty acids?
Sahaja Yogi: From the food.
Another Sahaja Yogi: But where do they? Somewhere must have [unclear]?
Shri Mataji: [Some and what then?]
Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know.
Shri Mataji: [So you are going to the] oxygen, everything.
Sahaja Yogi: Fatty acids are produced, you see, if you go back to plant [lesson], Mataji, fatty acids are produced basically by things that eat, vegetables.
Shri Mataji: Ah, vegetables? Supposing we eat them but where does it come from?
Sahaja Yogi: Cellulose.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Sahaja Yogi: You mean it’s ... It’s [private]. It’s primordial.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Sahaja Yogi: From the earth.
Shri Mataji: Simple.
Sahaja Yogi: From the earth element.
Shri Mataji: No. In the earth element we have got oils, already. With the earth element oils [even] which are produced carbohydrates.
Sahaja Yogi: No, it cannot be.
Shri Mataji: All right? So the petrol you can’t eat, can you?
Sahaja Yogi: No, I cannot adjust it.
Shri Mataji: None of the oils that are produced by Mother Earth we have it. So which is the fat that we get? What is the source of that fat?
Sahaja Yogi: Don’t know, Mother.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Well, vegetation.
Shri Mataji: What are you so [unclear] carries the Mother Earth.
Sahaja Yogi: Plants and plants and animals.
Shri Mataji: [unclear]. Same oils are converted by the plants and by the sun into subtler fats.
Sahaja Yogi: Achcha, so the subtles and the fats are.
Shri Mataji: What we use is nothing but petrol.
Sahaja Yogi: Then we shouldn’t burn it, Mother. Another day they used to say that petrol was originally plants.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Hmm, that’s right.
Shri Mataji: You see, this petrol is made subtler for the use of man by the action of the sun. Who watches the sun away is prana. So gana acts on the Mother Earth, the petrol and creates the fat which is available.
Sahaja Yogi: For us.
Shri Mataji: Means for this motorcar a new petrol is made that way. All right?
Sahaja Yogi: So that is why.
Shri Mataji: But within it is the hydrogen.
Sahaja Yogi: So fat is very unusual, Mother. And that is only carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and contains no nitrogen.
Shri Mataji: Mmm?
Sahaja Yogi: Fat is a very high per cent hydro or what’s it hydrogen in relation with oxygen, isn’t it? Much higher than.
Shri Mataji: Only hydrogen they just [cut it].
Sahaja Yogi: Hydrogen in relation with oxygen.
Shri Mataji: So it is the moon. This is the action of moon, sun and the Mother Earth, inside to support it. But in human beings it is formed as flabbiness. As fat is produced and the moon [created] this fat. Flabbiness.
Sahaja Yogi: That is why until the Mooladhara chakra opens, the Swadishthana cannot open fully. The Mooladhara chakra, I think you were telling in [Jamail], Mataji, that in Puja, when we do Puja, Mooladhara chakra opens and then Swadishthana opens.

Shri Mataji: If your Mooladhara is closed up I think I’m [stopped/stucked]. But it’s slightly opened in somebody. What I try to say that when the left side hydrogen within us, that’s mixed up with [water, water], that means more hydrogen is added, through the water some [unclear] is formed and that is the one which forms fat. So most of the people are fat are left-sided.
Sahaja Yogi: That I admit. My patients when they come in [there] they get fat.
Shri Mataji: Aaa?
Sahaja Yogi: I, I noticed something very interesting, Mother. When I was a [registry] I joined the psychiatric also there. All third year was joined together. And I noticed within six months they all put on weight, specially here the young. All the young doctors.
Shri Mataji: In the psychiatric hospitals whatever they have. Too much of hydrogen.
Sahaja Yogi: Too much left. But I noticed since coming to work here I put on a lot of weight as if like a reaction.
Shri Mataji: So like this you do that hydrogen comes from moon and that the hydrogen then it reacts on water and gives more hydrogen. Then fats are formed as flab to begin with. And then you get fatty acids. If it doesn’t go in the chest it goes in the blood.
Sahaja Yogi: What diseases are caused by too much flab/flam Mother?
Shri Mataji: Too much fat?
Sahaja Yogi: Too much flab/flam. Or too much fat even.
Shri Mataji: So, [jada]. Hydrogen. It makes you jada.

Sahaja Yogi: So arthritis.
Shri Mataji: Mmm?
Sahaja Yogi: Arthritis is caused by.
Shri Mataji: All kinds of arthritis in circulation.
Sahaja Yogi: Could they also be responsible for breathing troubles and bronchitis and [unclear]?
Shri Mataji: If it goes into the lungs.
Sahaja Yogi: Achcha, achcha.
Shri Mataji: Flab, if it goes into the lungs.
Sahaja Yogi: So the whole thing revolves around the relative amount of the moon.
Shri Mataji: Moon is the first.
Sahaja Yogi: In the first.
Shri Mataji: But it is always at a contrast with the sun.
Sahaja Yogi: Do You have anything, Mother, to do with the moon in Your Kundalini?
Shri Mataji: Moon in your?
Sahaja Yogi: Kundalini. [Jag Ma] Kundalini.
Shri Mataji: Of course. Of course, must be.
Sahaja Yogi: Where is that?
Another Sahaja Yogi: That [is] Your horoscope.
Shri Mataji: Moon is very important. As [Hindi] this moon is important.
Sahaja Yogi: So what is the significance, Mother, as if we take it sign by sign? Like my moon is in [Hindi] so what defects?
Shri Mataji: Oh, that I don’t know.
Sahaja Yogi: You don’t know about that. It’s OK.
Shri Mataji: But that [Hindi] is Sagittarius. That means as far as Atma is concerned, you are straightforward. That’s why in India we use the, not signs, but another thing.
Sahaja Yogi: The [Rakshi].
Shri Mataji: The lunar.
Sahaja Yogi: Aaa, [Rakshi] that is lunar.
Shri Mataji: Because for us the left side, the moon is important.
Sahaja Yogi: And [Lagna] is in the middle.
Shri Mataji: Aaa?
Sahaja Yogi: Three things we use: [Lagna], surya or [rashi]. So [Lagna] is what, Mother? That is, must be the Mooladhara.
Shri Mataji: [Lagna] is...
Sahaja Yogi: Or for horoscope.
Shri Mataji: I mean, in private you have this as nitrogen. This is nitrogen, actually. The [centre] comes through nitrogen.
Sahaja Yogi: So [Lagna] is the centre of one’s existence. So when someone’s [Lagna] what your [Lagna] is, will describe your...
Shri Mataji: It’s a combination, everything [reverbs/reverts] on the [chakras].
Sahaja Yogi: So we have chandran and the Lagna or [Hindi] in Lagna. We’re thinking that they are prop for your ascent.
Shri Mataji: I don’t know all that.
Sahaja Yogi: But this is also part of vidya, Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Just now we are dealing with [chandra].
Sahaja Yogi: You can also think about and at a very large scale that at the same degree of subtlety, countries which are producing, areas which are producing oily plants, oily plants, are opened that sided. That’s, that’s, if you think geographically...
Another Sahaja Yogi: Mustard for example. They are very full of mustard.
Shri Mataji: Yeah?
Sahaja Yogi: Yeah. This area it grows a lot of mustard.
Another Sahaja Yogi: And just so just thinking about areas around the world and the...
Shri Mataji: One can work it out. Means you have got the principle and then use it.

Sahaja Yogi: What about these countries which are extracting oil from the earth? They must be having a very harmful effect on the...
Shri Mataji: Who? Those who are extracting?
Sahaja Yogi: It’s going the other way.
Shri Mataji: But you see the thing is, they extract oil...
Sahaja Yogi: They don’t have to face...
Shri Mataji: They have no subtler ways. Otherwise are very thin people, extremely thin.
Sahaja Yogi: They are going against...
Shri Mataji: Mmmm?
Sahaja Yogi: They are going against this principle, aren’t they?
Shri Mataji: Yes, that is full of [subtlety] in extraction of these oils. But they are very thin.
Sahaja Yogi: That is why their point and one thing that is obvious is that any country that produces oil has some battle or fight is going on there. Iraq, most of these countries that produce oil, they are having some problem or other.
Shri Mataji: Sun is, no? The sun makes this. It’s a scorching hot place. And the sun has created all of that. In that sun you find this. Because there’s no moon in, no moon at all. That’s why Mohammed Sahab wanted them to worship the moon.
Sahaja Yogi: To get the balance.
Shri Mataji: Right.

Another Sahaja Yogi: And also previously the Semitic people of this area were much heavier, much chantier than they are today.
Shri Mataji: Which place is that?
Sahaja Yogi: The Middle East generally. The Semitic people in, in early time, in really early time. Much before.
Shri Mataji: Yeah. Youth, youth were never been taught normally. They have to be seen, aren’t they?
Sahaja Yogi: Generally, yeah.
Shri Mataji: [The central to be seen].
Sahaja Yogi: But that’s nowadays.
Shri Mataji: Ha. Nowadays. And that’s they’ve got, I mean, they are going very right side.
Sahaja Yogi: Jewish men especially are very thin.
Shri Mataji: Can be. [Yes].
Sahaja Yogi: I can say there are very few fat. It is true.
Shri Mataji: Hmm?
Sahaja Yogi: Very, very few of them are fat.
Shri Mataji: Mmm. Same with Arabs. If you see Arabs.
Sahaja Yogi: But that’s misuse of the energy, isn’t it Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes, misuse or overuse.
Sahaja Yogi: More overuse, yeah.
Shri Mataji: Overuse. In fact, whatever reactions are nonsense because the sun is there scorchingly [hot/hard]. The, they take out the... The oil....
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Is formed there. They take out the oil. It’s such a [temperature or formed there?]. You can’t blame them. You can’t blame the nature. Because of their temperament. Forget it.
Sahaja Yogi: But I remember descriptions in the Old Testament that they are waiting people.
Shri Mataji: They are all [unclear] one. That was in Iran or in Egypt there they are. See, they never got it.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I’ll think about it.
Shri Mataji: That’s why in Iran they worshipped the sun. In Egypt they worshipped the sun.
Sahaja Yogi: No balance at all. You have seen, Mother, that Indra’s capital was in Iran, some [quite near]. That’s a very right-sided.
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course. Very right-sided.
Sahaja Yogi: As well as [bond] to strive on.
Shri Mataji: [unclear] the memory.
Sahaja Yogi: Even to this day the Parsees is all on the right, absolutely on the right. They have no [left side].
Shri Mataji: Very [unclear]. Parsees are very selfish, very right-sided. All right. So that. Where are we?
Sahaja Yogi: Well, maybe You showed this source of fats. Then we were back to the point of the Tao.
Shri Mataji: But what neutralizes fat now?
Sahaja Yogi: [unclear] one.
Shri Mataji: Prana comes from proteins, you see. Chana is [udandaya] Sahaja Yogi. Gives you the Udan, Udan with the Sahaja Yogis. But with others it can give them belching or can give them gases. It can be both ways.
Sahaja Yogi: What happens to, where do we use, Mother? Gives you what?
Shri Mataji: Udan, udan.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s one of the five Pranas.
Shri Mataji: Prana that goes upwards.
Sahaja Yogi: Ha Tha. [Udana] the first.
Shri Mataji: But the Udana Prana can give belching to people who do not have their chakras opened. [Nabhi comes].
Sahaja Yogi: So the five Pranas must be... What are their various functions of these udaan, vyana...
Shri Mataji: Vyana.
Sahaja Yogi: Apana. Apana. Vyana.
Shri Mataji: Vyana is the one that [distributes] coming. [Hindi] Rhythm. Rhythm. All right, who will take them out? She, she wants to. Can you? Go.
Sahaja Yogi: Such a ... But it’s not only the protein part of the chana. It’s the carbohydrate part as well.
Shri Mataji: Hmmm?
Sahaja Yogi: The carbohydrate part of the chana as well will help, won’t it?
Shri Mataji: Carbohydrate?
Sahaja Yogi: That, that part as well as protein part will assist in this...
Shri Mataji: Chana has very little carbohydrate.
Sahaja Yogi: Really?
Shri Mataji: Very. Very little [carbohydrate] is in. Is a, is a treatment for food calories. Treatment something for diabetes.
Sahaja Yogi: Instead of having [this germinated] carbohydrates.
Shri Mataji: For diabetic people you can grind it, make it into anything.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s very rich in protein.
Shri Mataji: Absolutely rich in protein.
Sahaja Yogi: Some people in Bihar, they only eat chana. They eat nothing, just [tatu].
Shri Mataji: Tatu is chana. For lethargic people chana is very good. [Horses] eat chana. And the white horses must eat chana. It gives you energy.

Sahaja Yogi: Is there anything it’s not good for, Mother?
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?
Sahaja Yogi: Is there anything is not good for? Chana?
Shri Mataji: Is not good for?
Sahaja Yogi: Is there anything?
Shri Mataji: What?
Another Sahaja Yogi: Is there anything is harmful for any?
Shri Mataji: Can you sit?
Sahaja Yogi: Not good for the bhoots.
Shri Mataji: For a Sahaja Yogi it is not. For a non Sahaja Yogi, it is. It gives you gases. It gives hiccups.
Sahaja Yogi: It also puts some weight.
Shri Mataji: No, no, this chana wouldn’t do.
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, before Realization.
Shri Mataji: No, no, never.

Sahaja Yogi: You see, all these rickshaw and all the coolie, they eat only chana. No vegetables, nothing. Just chana.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Really?
Sahaja Yogi: They are all very healthy, very strong. The right balance.
Shri Mataji: You see, they are muscular, for muscular people, must [have].
Sahaja Yogi: Very muscular. So eating chana must be very good...
Shri Mataji: No. The body shows [unclear] come and [just advertize], “Eat chana, eat chana”.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s a, that’s a complete misunderstanding in the West, Mother, because we thought that these second class proteins, as they are called, are substantial fat-giving.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.
Another Sahaja Yogi: You see, they are, the so-called primer proteins. They are the right-sided.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I know. These are the balanced. Is the balanced.
Sahaja Yogi: These are the balanced.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Yes. No, no, I accept it, Mother. I accept it we get all these [things] set in our head, which are completely wrong.
Shri Mataji: This one, then you have moong dhal. Very good, left-sided.
Sahaja Yogi: Ha, hm, very good for the stomach. It makes, chew it, moong dhal.
Shri Mataji: Moong dhal is even better than chana. It gives no pressure.
Sahaja Yogini: What is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Moong dhal. Moong dhal. Moong beans, I can call it.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Oh, that, yes, yes.

Sahaja Yogi: So, what is good for adding fat, Mother?
Shri Mataji: For what?
Sahaja Yogi: For putting fat.
Shri Mataji: For adding fat? Sugar. Take four kilos every day. You will have fat.
Sahaja Yogi: He needs that.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Oh, I’m all right, Mother.
Shri Mataji: One must put on some.
Sahaja Yogi: Some more?
Shri Mataji: Of, course, some more. What?
Sahaja Yogi: Actually [his suit] is tight after Sahaja Yoga.
Shri Mataji: No, no, you must have got those [tight] ones. That’s a problem for [we shouldn’t put on, size] [unclear]. I mean, people even if they become as [straws], they want to diet. I don’t know if that is very good. Gavin, you don’t take sufficient sugar also.
Sahaja Yogi: All right, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Don’t you? And another thing is never to fuss about food. Those who fuss about food they never put on weight. Example is Mr. C. P. Srivastava. He eats like this, double, and no diet. No, but that is important. You have to eat [anything].
Sahaja Yogi: He is less active than You are.
Shri Mataji: Mmmm?
Sahaja Yogi: Much less active than You are.
Shri Mataji: No. That I can’t say.
Sahaja Yogi: He sits in the office all the time.
Shri Mataji: He’s sedentary. Can’t say about, it’s one of his habits.
Sahaja Yogi: How?
Shri Mataji: But that’s not the point. The point is, if you are fussy about food, you see, your body’s rejecting it. The fussy men never put on weight.
Sahaja Yogi: He goes [from] right.
Shri Mataji: Are you fussy?
Sahaja Yogi: He’s the opposite. He’s indiscriminate one.
Shri Mataji: Mmmm?
Sahaja Yogi: He’s the opposite. He’s indiscriminate. Very cool, it’s cool, isn’t it?
Shri Mataji: I don’t understand the left cooling of him, left towards Me very nice.
That’s [so good of it]. Now there is a kidding at each other. It’s nice to only watch, isn’t it? So then, Swadishthana.
Sahaja Yogi: Ha. Only one gland we haven’t done in Swadishthana, and that is the adrenal gland.
Shri Mataji: Mmmm?
Sahaja Yogi: The adrenal gland in Swadishthana. Not the adrenal cortex. Cortex is OK. That is steroids. But the adrenal medulla which produces adrenaline. For that comes [on both sides or from outside] the Swadishthana and it produces [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi (at the telephone): Hello. Yes. No, it’s [unclear].
Shri Mataji: They started?
Sahaja Yogi (speaking at the phone): [Aside: No, it’s not. It’s [Garry/C.P. and Rachel]. Mother is talking about medicine to us. [Mother] they are asking if they can come, [Garry/C.P.] and Rachel?
Shri Mataji: How much time they take?
Sahaja Yogi: Ten minutes, fifteen minutes.
Shri Mataji: Come.
Sahaja Yogi (at the phone): Yes, come over.

Shri Mataji: Then we’ll go, now after the...
Sahaja Yogi: If we go for a little walk I’ll show you flowers, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Shop [Hindi].
Sahaja Yogi: Will be. Achcha, shop day.
Shri Mataji: Today is the only day.
Sahaja Yogi: Ha, tike, shop day.
Shri Mataji: [Hindi]
Sahaja Yogi: Achha. Tike.
Shri Mataji: Hanna?
Sahaja Yogi: No problem. I think you have to come to a hospital on Sunday, Christ day. [Ask Jesus, hanna].
Shri Mataji: [Characterless]. Now, she looks quite disturbed about things. Is it Christine?
Sahaja Yogini: As now you are here, Mother, I’m not disturbed anymore.
Shri Mataji: Just see. One master will put you a tester for everything. I’ve talked to C.P. and I told him, “If you want to have your fussy food then you bring Me a supper. It’s no [unclear]. It’s your discretion.” “No,” he said, “I am not fussy at all.” “I know you are not.” He said that, “[I’m glad or I would like?] to eat outside with you and [family].” So our problem is solved. So we are eating outside. Only for the lunch perhaps I was thinking to have it here. But even for lunch I think you should not worry because if you are going to give the hall, you can give them lunch and [unclear] there.
Sahaja Yogi: And give it to all.
Shri Mataji: Ha.

Sahaja Yogi: Do they have good restaurants, you know [this time in Lausanne]?
Another Sahaja Yogi: You would know or you would know. No.
Shri Mataji: Course God knows what time they would come.
Sahaja Yogis: Then maybe not give them [unclear]?
Sahaja Yogi: Also there are nice [things to be seen], as well.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Ah?
Sahaja Yogis: The surroundings are very nice, Mother.
Sahaja Yogini: One nice Indian restaurant seems to be the best one.
Shri Mataji: Not good. He’s not looking for an Indian restaurant.
Another Sahaja Yogini: See the [subtler]. Because where is [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: Is no way very good.
Another Sahaja Yogi: There’s one good Italian restaurant.
Shri Mataji: They have to eat exactly like you eat here.
Sahaja Yogi: To me are the best.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Three zero and ask them to call Dr Rao.
Shri Mataji: There are some Italian one?
Sahaja Yogis: There is, Mother, but I mean it’s, it’s not a, I don’t know if Mr. C.P. will go.
Shri Mataji: No. [Pizza] He likes to eat Italian.
Sahaja Yogi: I’ll ask, Mother, one of my friends here who were telling me of a good Italian restaurant.
Shri Mataji: All right.
Sahaja Yogi: He said it was very good.
Shri Mataji: Where? Nearby?
Sahaja Yogi: I’ll ask him. He, I’ll bring him here. He is a doctor here.
Shri Mataji: So you see once they come to give the hall I would say that we’ll take our lunch there, wherever it is and come and sleep for a while. And then go round and see the places nearby and then what we can do is to, tomorrow [have]. Then in the evening time, when I go for the program they would like to rest here.
Sahaja Yogi: We shall inform [unclear]
Shri Mataji: What is the evening entertainment here? For the/Sir C.P., not for Me.
Sahaja Yogi: Believe me, I’m telling, what they have, it’s pubs.
Shri Mataji: Nothing but the pubs?
Sahaja Yogis: [unclear]. It’s cinema maybe. It’s cinema.
Shri Mataji: Did they go round? You see, it’s quite polite to have organized all things.
Sahaja Yogi (to Rao doctor): Hello. There’s a cinema. I want to ask you, Rao Sahab, which is this Italian restaurant you went to?
Another Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it’s probably nicest thing to do, it’s to go around. There are some very pretty places.
Shri Mataji: If we can go around and join us about ten o’clock to the restaurant, to what place is that, so that meal part we’ll think for the family, all right?
Sahaja Yogi: Gondola. The gondola.
Sahaja Yogini: Gondola.
Shri Mataji: Gondola.
Sahaja Yogi: Where is that? [Opens the door.] OK, OK, thanks a lot. Bye.
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, can I show You the advertisement we’ll give in the local paper? It will be also tonight. I will be again this night, this evening.
Shri Mataji: It’s very rightly placed in. In the evening it will appear?
Sahaja Yogini: It appeared yesterday. This newspaper starts at lunch timer really. Lunchtime and again in the evening. And today also lunchtime and again in the evening. Today I am sure [it] will be placed in the top, at the, absolutely at the top of the center pages. So I, I’ll buy one of these papers today.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, just to finish off on sugar. There seems that there are two categories beings. The right-sided person who is thin needs a lot of sugar. A left-sided person, in fact the sugar will neutralize the fat. It will have two different effects.
Shri Mataji: No, not for left side. For left-sided person.... You mean you say for the [inerts] ones.
Sahaja Yogi: Well, I only wonder, say, today...
Shri Mataji: No, what I tell you one thing about this. This left-sided person has the energy which is frozen. Right-sided person has the energy which is exhausted. So you need an outside [replacement] for the right-sided person. For the left-sided person, whatever is stored in has to be [heated up].
Sahaja Yogi: So what did you mean when You said sugar digest the fats?
Shri Mataji: Sugar digests the fats, that means it accumulates. See, say if you take to carbohydrates...
Sahaja Yogi: Should be, should be exhausted.
Shri Mataji: [unclear] You put little fat, all right? And put water in it. It will not go. But you put little fat and put some sugar...
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I understand, it is [accession], it multiplies it.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

Another Sahaja Yogi: So Mother, they’ve just left...
Shri Mataji: Who?
Sahaja Yogi: C.P. and [unclear]. Now it’s twenty to eleven.
Sahaja Yogi: Do you think [how long is] about?
Another Sahaja Yogi: Three hours or so...
Sahaja Yogi: 1.30 or 2 they will come.
Shri Mataji: Aaa?
Sahaja Yogi: 1.30 to 2.
Shri Mataji: [Hindi]
Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]
Shri Mataji: You see the thing is, the question, you should try a balance. C.P. is too formal. You see, to him, if you cook for him, it’s a burden. He himself is cooking. He’s worried himself, you see. That sort of a man he is. So it’s better not to cook for him.
[Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: One meal. Tomorrow lunch time then?
Shri Mataji: As general cana is not so important. You see, today, you want to give him something. What you can give? [Hindi] I can give it Myself.
Sahaja Yogi: And we can help You.
[Hindi]
Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi] But if you just remind me. So Sadhana gharam masala likes. [Hindi]
Shri Mataji: Give us chicken.
Sahaja Yogi: Chicken we’ll have. Yes.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother, I’ve got two for You and the family, of course. I’ve got something for You.
Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Chicken. You get yoghurt. Keep it for an hour or so.
[Hindi – talking about food and masalas]
Sahaja Yogi: Achha, ha, ha. That is I remember, yes, that was also part of it. Then tandoor may finish and no problem. [Hindi] When You come back to give the dinner first.
[Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Sarsun is different.
Sahaja Yogini: I could get it.
Sahaja Yogi: Actually, I hardly [get] to have these pomegranate seed, [Hindi].
Shri Mataji: [Hindi]
Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi] I never used that.
Shri Mataji: Punjabi is using.
Sahaja Yogi: Achcha, beautiful. The U.P. don’t.
Shri Mataji: They know, they use it in [Hindi].That’s all India. But remember now do it. Otherwise I’ll make it.
Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi] I’ll do the, the chicken, everything... [Hindi]
Another Sahaja Yogi: Esther does a lot of... You have all the masalas, isn’t it?
[Hindi, speaking about spices]
Sahaja Yogi: You have no mint, isn’t it? The green one or the dried?
Sahaja Yogini: Dried.
Sahaja Yogi: OK, dried.
[Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [losers] are. They cannot. This is the Christ has committed.
Sahaja Yogi: Achcha. This one is the power of will as known.
Shri Mataji: Animals, whatever will power they have, it’s more sort of responsive. That willowy power is the will power which is controlled.
Sahaja Yogi: That is to be exercised by all of us.
Shri Mataji: That is to be exercised.
Sahaja Yogi: That is the thing that is lacking, you know, the control.
Shri Mataji: So now, the reaction through this Agnya that you [doom or know] produces the [jada/journey]. Animals are innocent. They are absolutely innocent. They are just responsive. [unclear] to see the food then they want to eat. If they are not conditioned [they will not do it OR like human being], they will go all out to eat. They are not bothered or like one [would] say of however they eat, like, like this, like a hog. They don’t have the tidiness. For them, hog and all, there’s no problem. That is, they live. They live with the nature. Their nature is such, they have no problems. They don’t have to fight persons, as we fight ourselves. But that’s what happens when we assert Agnya. The reaction starts building within us which is actually the innocence, which is the jada, is the material thing. Jada is matter. So we produce that within ourselves as a reaction.
Sahaja Yogi: So there is always this conflict in human beings between innocence and ego?
Shri Mataji: Conflict is always. They don’t have any conflicts. Animals don’t have any conflicts. How can they have? Because they don’t have two things; they have only one.
Sahaja Yogi: Rather this conflict we evolve.
Shri Mataji: Is to begin with.
Sahaja Yogi: To begin with?
Shri Mataji: You see, this decision making there’s not problem as for [human beings/animals as they have animal’s mind]. They don’t have to make decisions. All right? [There’s / they are] all instinctive, instinctive. And the guiding factor within them, and all the animals are guided by nature. Like a bird can feel the magnetism. It has a magnet, you see. There’s auricular magnet in so many birds, and must be in the fishes, the way they know how to go up and down, up. So there’s a magnetism, which is the, we should say Mooladhara. So what happens, that reaction to this Agnya, that Agnya dissolves these matters.
Sahaja Yogi: Achcha.

Shri Mataji: And to react to it, is produced again.
Sahaja Yogi: This, this prostate gland.
Shri Mataji: That is, you retain the innocence, you say.
Sahaja Yogi: But there’s no doubt that the prostate glands have a very powerful protective effect on us.
Shri Mataji: When? See, the best is to give you an example. A man thinks what’s wrong if he sleeps with ten women. He will have a disease.
Sahaja Yogi: In the prostate gland.
Shri Mataji: Prostate gland is a cause of mind who is ego-oriented, specially adulterous eyes. I mean, one of the symptoms. I am not saying that if you have adulterous eyes you will get the prostate, no doubt. But if you have prostate doesn’t mean you have adulterous eyes. These adulterous eyes can give you prostate gland.
Sahaja Yogi: I’ve noticed Mother, in London, in London there is all rubbish everywhere on the street, everything. Even if you just look in the front, second you can feel it is sucked into Mooladhara immediately.
Shri Mataji: So, that’s why Christ has said, “Don’t have adulterous eyes,” because He will protect you. Yes? The prostate gland starts overact, being overactive. Because once you start becoming adulterous it starts reacting and the body, you see, secretes more and more of this jada into the prostate gland to fight. [unclear] you get again prostate gland.
Sahaja Yogi: [unclear]
Shri Mataji: Jada is here and here. Jada creates the....
Sahaja Yogi: This is the prostate gland. Then checking here is the subtle, that suction inside.
Shri Mataji: When it’s inactive that is [unclear], inert, jada. You see, matter is not matter, I mean matter.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, is getting [Hindi]. Tula means jada.
Shri Mataji: Tula that is settled on.
Sahaja Yogi: Ah, that is not the jada.
Shri Mataji: Jada is, this is jada, this is jada, this is jada.
Sahaja Yogi: Matter/Made inert.
Shri Mataji: Inert, inert, inert is jada.
Sahaja Yogi: So there’s a quick inertion to...
Shri Mataji: So the innocence is inert, is inert.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: What is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I, I think I’m...
Another Sahaja Yogi: You see, once you are driving at, Mother, you are getting this release as a result of this development in man of this inert material which has a fight with the ego.
Sahaja Yogi: Counterbalances that.
Another Sahaja Yogi: And, and accordingly so the prostate, the active part materializes or does not materialize. And so you get this pro hypertrophy on, or the opposite of the prostate gland itself.

Shri Mataji: Anything that goes into [unclear]. Say now [unclear]. Stomach. Stomach uses energy out of food and the inert goes in the Mooladhara.
Sahaja Yogi: The [unclear], Mataji, of...
Shri Mataji: You see one question is...
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Whatever charges you energy anymore is the Mooladhara. So everything that is inert, created, where the energy is being used, go into Mooladhara.
Sahaja Yogi: So if Mooladhara is overdeveloped you become inert. Is that true [meaning].
Shri Mataji: Aaa?
Sahaja Yogi: In human beings when Mooladhara is overdeveloped, Mooladhara chakra...
Shri Mataji: So can we go through? If it is overdeveloped or underdeveloped?
Sahaja Yogi: Overdeveloped.

Shri Mataji: That is the general principle for everything. You see, if it overdeveloped then it’s a hot Mooladhara. If it is underdeveloped it’s a cool Mooladhara.
Sahaja Yogi: Achcha. Hot Mooladhara what? Hot temperature?
Shri Mataji: Hot Mooladhara is the Mooladhara which is overused or too much of heat and all that, overactive.
Sahaja Yogi: Constantly the sympathetic and much release in.
Shri Mataji: [Guiding].
Sahaja Yogi: Release in.
Shri Mataji: Mmm?
Sahaja Yogi: Overuse, leading to the overuse of the sympathetic part which drains the parasympathetic of...
Shri Mataji: Overuse it. You accumulate by that overuse the jada, the inert thing, the residual of the thing that [satisfies], that precipitates. And then you become malignant or you become jada as a reaction.
Sahaja Yogi: Then, one thing they discovered about these glands is that they protect against stomach ulcers.
Shri Mataji: Mmm?
Sahaja Yogi: Prostate glands.
Shri Mataji: They protect against?
Sahaja Yogi: Stomach ulcers. And the other thing is they cause arthritis. Another [thing], is the latest thing that the arthritis....
Shri Mataji: Prostate glands cannot be.
Sahaja Yogi: Let’s see...You said that [unclear]...
Shri Mataji: Is jada,
Sahaja Yogi: And produces that ceasing up.

Shri Mataji: Mooladhara is jada. And overactivity creates jada more. Like carbon dioxide or anything like that, you see, as the waste products. All the waste products become inert and that inertness gives additional size to the prostate. And then this jada can go into arthritis also.
Sahaja Yogi: Cause You were saying many times that arthritis is just caused by this accumulating...
Shri Mataji: Because whatever is jada, inert, is actually vibrations, frozen. They are frozen type.
Sahaja Yogi: This, this is what they have discovered in modern physics, Mother. Matter is nothing but frozen vibrations just held by force fields.
Shri Mataji: Is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. So the book which is being written is called the Tao Physics, which goes by side to them.
Shri Mataji: Now what do you say?
Sahaja Yogi: As no such things is matter. It is just frozen vibrations.
Shri Mataji: And then?
Sahaja Yogi: That is how You [demonstrate].
Shri Mataji: Frozen energy is inert.
Sahaja Yogi: And that is how they produced atom bomb. Because they produced the unfreezing little of the energy using these various techniques they have discovered and that produces so much energy. Einstein equation was equal to empty square which is the amount of energy that is released by a mount of matter that becomes pure vibrations and equivalent to the mass of that energy times of square of the speed of light. Such a tremendous increasing.
Shri Mataji: But this is what it is. So these are vibrations which is electromagnetic.
Sahaja Yogi: Ha. That’s right. They call it first....
Shri Mataji: These are not chaitanya. Only electromagnetic. But they are part of the chaitanya.
Sahaja Yogi: But at the subtle level they must be Chaitanya, which we haven’t seen.

Shri Mataji: You see, what happens is that, first the ‘chaitanya lahari’, we can say, is the desire power; then it becomes action power, and thirdly it becomes the evolutionary. So all these three things put together is actually the All-pervading Power, out of which electromagnetic comes from the right side. So all electromagnetic powers which become inert, get settled into Mooladhara. All right? I’m such clear-cut.
Sahaja Yogi: Then what? There must be some effect, Mother, on one’s living in this environment which we live in, in the modern age, where the whole air is full of the electromagnetic radiation, because these power lines are giving out electromagnetic radiation. So, they must, these ones must settle down also in our state
Shri Mataji: You see, everything that is inert becomes - or say you take plastics are, nothing bud jada. Plastics are jada, inert.
So, all inert things go to the Maha Ganesha.

Sahaja Yogi: I used to notice that in this village where I was staying in India, we had no electricity. Two hours a day we would get. And all the inertia that stood there was slowly releasing. Because there has been, we lived near a place where there is a heavy power line, we feel very really confusing, things going.
Shri Mataji: No, actually in India, they have started a ordure gas. Now they want to use faeces for that.
Sahaja Yogi: That is useless.
Shri Mataji: Just to convert.
Sahaja Yogi: [That it won’t work].
Shri Mataji: For the gas.
Sahaja Yogi: To burn?
Shri Mataji: Yes. Just have to use that faeces. They put all this ordure whether is cow dung in a plate.
Sahaja Yogi: But what about?
Shri Mataji: After some time,
Sahaja Yogi: The gas is produced.
Shri Mataji: It produces gas.
Sahaja Yogi: But are the vibrations all right?
Shri Mataji: Mmm?
Sahaja Yogi: The vibrations from this?
Shri Mataji: Ordure gas is all right, about I don’t know, among gas.
Sahaja Yogi: But faeces, You see, it will produce awful vibrations unless you burn it only. First they used to burn it away in the sun.
Shri Mataji: But these gases only are the part of the prana, you see. [Pass] negative, pass that prana.
Sahaja Yogi: Dhyana, prana, udhyana.
Shri Mataji: So, this is one of the dead style. So all of them are part of the prana.

Sahaja Yogi: So would you say Mother that prana is that ‘sukshma’ of the electricity, electromagnetic radiation?
Shri Mataji: Of course, it is the ‘sukshma’ of all the causals.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, the causal, which are they?
Shri Mataji: Of the elements.
Sahaja Yogi: Acha.
Shri Matai: You see.
Sahaja Yogi: So, the prana is the causal of all the elements.
Shri Mataji: No, no. All the elements have a causal. And prana is the essence of this causal.
Sahaja Yogi: Achcha. So when we do this Pranayama Puja, then we are awakening this causal.
Shri Mataji: From Pranayama, when you do it, then you try to control your right side. But it’s not necessary for people who are already right-sided people. It is meant, pranayama is meant for people who are in inertia, you see, who are nothing but frozen gases. To release their gases make them subtler, is the idea. But not for people who have already released them to the maximum.

Sahaja Yogi: Should I notice that in the Easter Puja that we have one of the things they will do is Pranayama.
Shri Mataji: So, this jada settles in the prostate gland and also various disease settle down in them.
Sahaja Yogi: That is right. This is you can see one more difference, it’s subtle. It’s very important.
Shri Mataji: It looks like if you put something coloured in the hair, it settles down. Whatever, you think of the eyes, whatever jada you catch in the eyes, settles down. And if this gets spoilt, you know, prostate goes out.
Sahaja Yogi: How to release this, Mother? Because this is the thing that catches, and all my patients have this very heavy.
Shri Mataji: This has come because of over-reading, of seeing bad things, of colouring, all sort of things. So, the best thing is for this, is the Mother Earth. Sleep on the Mother Earth for this and see the Mother Earth itself.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, as well as prostatic problems is a disease You also mean there are others diseases, don’t You? A wider category of, of Mooladhara type diseases and that the venereal diseases.
Shri Mataji: Ah! All are –
Sahaja Yogi: Related.
Shri Mataji: Related.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s not just prostatitis. It’s, it’s the whole range of those dirty diseases and things.
Shri Mataji: Diseases. Dirty diseases come from the sense. All the [out] dirty diseases they got.

All is a circle. Now I’ll tell you a good example first of all. Say our, what’s that Pune gentleman?
Sahaja Yogi: [unclear name]
Shri Mataji: Not that one. Old man.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, Rajavari.
Shri Mataji: Rajavari. Rajavari was a worshipper of Shiva, Shri Ganesha. And he got this prostate. Can you imagine? I mean, he was straightforward, nothing to do with sex business and a very simple, straightforward married man. He never had any idea of all this nonsense going on. He gets prostate.
Sahaja Yogi: Before realization, Mother, is this so?
Shri Mataji: No, no. After.
Sahaja Yogi: After?
Shri Mataji: I mean, as it was shown. I mean [looks like] he had it before but it wasn’t shown. And came to Me. He was not cured, at least this much I had the chance even if he had it. So I’ve asked him, “What do you do with your Ganesha?” He said, “No, I’m a Ganesha this thing, worshipper, this, that. Mother, You are Ganesha.” All these things he has said. That was a day of Shankar Shri Ganesh, this God on the fourth day, fourth day of the moon. I gave him some chana. He looked at Me. He said, “Mother, today is my fasting day.” “What?” He said, “Today is [chandran].” From the subtle it worked. “Now the day when He is born you are not supposed to fast. That is the day you must celebrate.” And he had this prostate. I said, “All right, you eat this chana, finished.” By the time we went his prostate it was absolutely all right. Collapsed. He’s [cleared]. Now see how subtle it is.
Sahaja Yogi: Very subtle.
Shri Mataji: Is too subtle for doctors. But take the gross side. Gross side is important. The man who has his rolling eyes [and steps like this]. Then he collects, you see, that bhoots from around. Because these are done mostly by bhoots, you see.

Once you start it, then look at one woman, at another woman, at another person. In the beginning it just starts as curiosity whatever it is. Then it starts improving. The end of it that is captured by the bhoots and these [are moved in]. And you are catching this, catching that, catching that. All it is going back here. All the bhoot’s staff. Now because this is a such an important thing for Mooladhara or it is Mooladhara here that has an effect, has an effect and is a problem.
Sahaja Yogi: Is it almost, is it bad to get sucked down by another?
Shri Mataji: Oh, it’s so subtle. But when you actually get into some series of women sort of thing then what happens that the reaction is built in the Mooladhara itself.
Sahaja Yogi: And then this inert material starts releasing.
Shri Mataji: Then this inert material starts accumulating, and that’s how you get this.
Sahaja Yogi: This inert thing has to grow.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Then if You, only You get these people who already have this accumulation.
Shri Mataji: Mmmm?
Sahaja Yogi: People who already have the Mooladharas become very dry. How to release that?
Shri Mataji: Those who have? Mooladhara which mean overactive or inactive?
Sahaja Yogi: Overactive, let us say. I think let us say that they have too much jada [inertia] in that Mooladhara.
Shri Mataji: Jada? If they have too much of jada?
Sahaja Yogi: Would you like some tea or something? Tea, chai pina?
Shri Mataji: Achcha. Or coffee?
Sahaja Yogi: Coffee, ha.
Shri Mataji: No, we don’t take that. Chai, yes, thank you. Little sugar and little milk, all right? Thank you.

Sahaja Yogi: How to release it Mother?
Shri Mataji: Mmmm?
Sahaja Yogi: This jada [inertia].
Shri Mataji: Jada. Now, what I am saying that when you have your Mooladhara attacked in this way, that it is all clustered into jada. Now how to release the Mooladhara is the problem. Now the best thing would be to sit on the Mother Earth when this is our Sahaja Yoga. Nirmala Vidya, you see, to get Nirmala more.
And you pull your feet up from the Mother earth. Put your Mooladhara absolutely there and ask Mother Earth to suck these problems. Just do like this. This thing, one thing. Then there’s another way that you lie down on the Mother Earth. Lift your hands, lift your body, lift your legs and just allow your Mooladhara to touch the Mother Earth, even for a short time. And then try to rub it, you see. It sucks all the problems.
Sahaja Yogi: Like this, in the vigitation [unsure].
Shri Mataji: Yes, vigitation [unsure], you see.
First of all, take a vow that, “We have done these mistakes and we have done in ignorance, and we have accumulated lots of inert thing. So, better take them away”.
20:56
Sahaja Yogi: I used to find one thing, Mother, when I used to meditate, this was in India not here, because there the Mooladhara releases more. But when the Mooladhara was releasing then everything would go to the Void like smoke.
Shri Mataji: That’s it. So the prana, that one, which is the ‘udan’ has just to rise higher comes into Void. And that is the one that is in, at the ultimate when you have to combine a prana and the mana shakti, that union rises. Then this ‘udan’ which is the subtler type of prana comes, like that.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s why, the other thing, I don’t know, Mother, it’s a incense stick, a doop, Indian doop, if you to meditate with doop. It’s how it releases this.
Shri Mataji: Dooptas.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. But small.
Shri Mataji: But too much of doopt also is not good. I mean they are using a kind of doopt, there. They are not using the real doopt. Actuallly, doopt comes from the Mother Earth. All the fragrance comes from the Mother Earth.
Sahaja Yogi: It is what you were saying, Mother, the causal of the earth.
Shri Mataji: Yes, causal, the fragrance is the causal of Mother Earth. So doopas if it is real, chandhana, doopa, anything like that.
Sahaja Yogi: Mogra we have.
Shri Mataji: Aaa?
Sahaja Yogi: Mogra we have.
Shri Mataji: Oh, yes, any flowers, any. These are innocent. These are the subtler expression of the innocence.
These can be jada, the seeds. If then they are seeds, they are jada. Then they become chaitanya. And then they become fragrance.
Sahaja Yogi: And human beings are also like that. Before Realization, they are jada.
Shri Mataji: Yes, very much so. They are all [unclear].

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, when, when people lead a dharmic life, when they don’t overuse sex? This releases the jada?
Shri Mataji: It’s much less.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s much less. Therefore the reaction aspect is minimum.
Shri Mataji: They have a very light body, you see, even if they are fat. Say I am very fat
but I can walk very fast.
Sahaja Yogi: I used to notice that in India you never felt the weight of your body but now I feel it tremendously [inert].
Shri Mataji: Because you see, the gravity, the Mother Earth. See, you have too much jada in you. So the Mother Earth [you feel it]. Otherwise you are very light. You don’t feel much weight there. You see, supposing I, I will get very heavy, that’s due to My vibrations sometimes. See, Mine it’s the [opposite/other side] side of it. Too many vibrations. I feel very heavy. But when there’s a release I feel all right. In the same way when you have jada within you I feel heavy because My vibrations start fighting against.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, when, when people lead a dharmic life, when they don’t overuse sex? This releases the jada?
Shri Mataji: It’s much less.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s much less. Therefore the reaction aspect is minimum.
Shri Mataji: They have a very light body, you see, even if they are fat. Say I am very fat

But when there’s a release I feel all right. In the same way when you have jada within you I feel heavy because My vibrations start fighting against.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes. Another way to release jada is footsoaking, isn’t it?
Another Sahaja Yogi: In the ocean is great.
Shri Mataji: Yes, but the best would be, I should say, to sit in the sand, put your feet up to this much inside, make a hole.
Sahaja Yogi: Hmm. That’s what we do on the beach. We dig a hole and we sit up to here in the water.
Shri Mataji: That’s a good idea.
Sahaja Yogi: It only [pricks] a little bit.

Shri Mataji: Do everything. This is all external. Internal is the sin type. They should desire, desire, “Let me be absolutely clean.”
Sahaja Yogi: That is the big thing.
Shri Mataji: Because that is the Kundalini.
Sahaja Yogi: Pray to Gauri, Gauri is the Shakti.
Shri Mataji: Actually, you see, the movement is that from the subtle desire you then come back [so you nourish it] and then you become the desire. That is the subtle. What is that Kundalini?
Sahaja Yogi: You said that the Kundalini, last night you said, Mother, a very important thing which was “The Kundalini is Your desire.”
Shri Mataji: Gives you?
Sahaja Yogi: Kundalini is Your, is the reflection of Your desire.
Shri Mataji: Of course.
Another Sahaja Yogi: That’s the basics.
Shri Mataji: That is the basic. But then you become the subtler desire. The subtlest desire, the [subdued] desire, the desire that [is Or think] The Desire, rest is all un-, whatever it is not desire is all a darkness.
Sahaja Yogi: [Anecha]
Shri Mataji: Disappears. Only what remains is this, is the Kundalini. And the Kundalini is the desire to be one with Me.
Sahaja Yogi: That is the very start of it.

Shri Mataji: So, it starts with one, which is in the gross, inert state. Then it goes into action. Then evolution takes place. Then it becomes subtler and then ends in Divinity.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s reflected in creation itself.
Shri Mataji: All right? [Divinity] is the enjoyer of the things.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s reflected in creation itself, isn’t it, Mother? Its reflection is...
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course, of course. The whole creation, the story of creation is like this. That the desire of God becomes the creation, human beings are created, out of human beings. Then they are made into that higher [nature] that is God Himself.

Sahaja Yogi: And that desire to be that, is [in us].
Shri Mataji: Desire? That desire to be is the only desire. The rest of desires is just a joke.
Sahaja Yogi: Excellent.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Gnyana also, the knowledge is a very important in achieving the evolution.
Shri Mataji: Gnyana? Which one? The book?
Sahaja Yogi: No, I mean, the, the...
Shri Mataji: Awareness.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, that, that knowledge.
Shri Mataji: Awareness, awareness. Awareness is the main thing. You see, awareness, as gnyana is.
Sahaja Yogi: Chitta, you are talking, Mother, of.
Shri Mataji: Chitta. Enlightened chitta. Enlightened chitta is that one. See, Mine is an enlightened chitta. You need decoding. I don’t need any decoding.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes.
Shri Mataji: I don’t have pressure at. I don’t even think.

Sahaja Yogi: But, Mother, as we grow, we become.
Shri Mataji: Mmmm?
Sahaja Yogi: As we grow more in You...
Shri Mataji: Yes, then you become like that.
Sahaja Yogi: We don’t need those gross...
Shri Mataji: No, no, you don’t need any gross methods or anything. You don’t have to go through that long way if there’s a straightforward [modus]. It’s just there.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, You know.
Shri Mataji: Straight there, you know, I know. You see, like this I know.
Sahaja Yogi: I know. That’s a different one, Mother.
Shri Mataji: That’s a different one.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s a different category.
Shri Mataji: I say, “Do you know there’s a bhoot in you?” “I know.” “All right.” “And that it is telling you all things against your Self and you are destroying everyone?” “I know.” “You are destroying Sahaja Yoga.” “I know.”

Sahaja Yogi: Then what do they do about?
Another Sahaja Yogi: Then the other day they come to the first place.
Shri Mataji: I know. He just thinks. [He’s angry.] Ha, so now we have done this prostate. Did you follow, prostate?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, that’s a very subtle one that, Mother. You started with the most subtle one of all.
Shri Mataji: Aaa?
Sahaja Yogi: You started with the most subtle one of all.
Shri Mataji: You started that way. I mean, you said, “You start with this chakra as it’s down, at least... ”
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, no, no, no, I ‘m saying, how beautiful.
Shri Mataji: Is it?
Sahaja Yogi: I’m saying how beautiful.
Another Sahaja Yogi: So then, then the endocrine glands of the Agnya are all of chaitanya. Is that what You were saying?
Shri Mataji: No, no.
Sahaja Yogi: No.
Shri Mataji: You see Agnya and prana again, I say.
Sahaja Yogi: Prana, ha.
Shri Mataji: You see, anything that is produced by chakras is not the chaitanya, not. Is only Kundalini.
Sahaja Yogi: Is it chaitanya?
Another Sahaja Yogi: Prana.

Shri Mataji: You see, now see. Kundalini is the chaitanya. This is prana, that is mana shakti and there’s a Kundalini is the combination of all these.
Sahaja Yogi: From this, Mother, if You follow that, the whole Universe is created by the chitta, the divine, is held, because chaitanya comes from chitta.
Shri Mataji: That is Brahma. You see, the chitta of the Divine is nothing but Brahma.
Sahaja Yogi: And it is held by the chitta. It is [get owned] by the chitta.
Shri Mataji: But there’s nothing like held or anything, I tell you. It’s just there. What do you call? There’s no language for that. Then just say, it’s, it’s a built-in process, you see. Do you say that the green color held is held by leaves?
Sahaja Yogi: The held in different sense, Ma.
Shri Mataji: But that is what I am not able to express Myself you see, that it is part and parcel.
Sahaja Yogi: In Sanskrit could we use it, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Gyana, [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: It’s just think to [unclear] of the whole thing.
Sahaja Yogi: We could say...
Shri Mataji: [unclear] is adharma. Dharma.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Dharma also is the same, You say.
Shri Mataji: Dharma is the same thing. Permeating. It’s the same thing. I mean, still the duality remains in English language, you see.
Sahaja Yogi: So You can say [unclear] sarva, chitta, bhakta.
Shri Mataji: Dharini.
Sahaja Yogi: Yeah, but something that is contained by, held by we [should/issue]. Because for You it is sarva chakra dharini, but we are sarva chitta bhakta. We are the ones are held by that chitta. Humble one. You are sarva chitta dharini.
Shri Mataji: Sarva chitta dharini, that’s all.
Sahaja Yogi: Aap hai.
Shri Mataji. Ha or kya?
Sahaja Yogi: Hamlog
Shri Mataji: Aaplog kya ha?
Sahaja Yogi: Sarva chitta bhakta.
Shri Mataji: Ah, yeah. That’s the way. Take an employed and employ.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s why.
Shri Mataji: But this duality doesn’t give you any sense, whatever it may be.
Sahaja Yogi: Ha, that is there.
Shri Mataji: This duality has to act. Achcha, so we come now to...
Sahaja Yogi: Nabhi or Swadishthan?

Shri

Mataji: Now you see, the thing is first is jada. So from the jada first thing starts is jada comes from all the five elements. What I was trying to tell you that even from mana the jada comes in. Even from mana, from the mind, jada comes in.
Sahaja Yogi: Mana is the left side.
Shri Mataji: Left side.
Sahaja Yogi: Desire.
Shri Mataji: Emotions. From emotions also the jada comes in. Emotional energy is also from the matter.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, I see. So I’s, it’s the totality of, of the whole sympathetic system, of left and right.
Shri Mataji: Achcha. Comes from. No, it becomes.
Sahaja Yogi: Yeah, it becomes. Yes, it, it, it has its source.
Shri Mataji: Inertness, it’s inertness. But you see, you say matter. Matter is very, is very scientific. Too much divided.
Sahaja Yogi: Then we shouldn’t use it, sounds [very odd].
Shri Mataji: Inert, inert.
Sahaja Yogi: So jada don’t say they won’t understand.
Shri Mataji: You see, your emotions can become inert.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, yeah.
Shri Mataji: From inert emotions... Now what has happened in these mad people? Emotions have become inert.
Sahaja Yogi: That is why.
Shri Mataji: If you can make them alert there will be normal people.
Sahaja Yogi: So for them, they need prana, Mother, these people.
Shri Mataji: Absolutely, nothing but prana.
Sahaja Yogi: How to give them prana, Mataji?
Shri Mataji: This is what?... If you teach them pranayama.
Sahaja Yogi: Pranayama. But they are not realized. [Their jada] is not [unclear].
Another Sahaja Yogi: They could get the awakening even with your person.
Sahaja Yogi: Some [I’ve given], some miss a lot to action.
Shri Mataji: See if you make them run.
Sahaja Yogi: Exercise.
Shri Mataji: Exercises. All these things.
Sahaja Yogi: Jada, do You spell like this Mother?
Shri Mataji: J A D A
Sahaja Yogi: I think that in Sanskrit is [unclear]. One d or double d?
Shri Mataji: [One of it]. Jada.
Sahaja Yogi: Jada.
Shri Mataji: Ja means which is born and da. Da means inert.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s, it’s the sort of totality of the precipitate, if it is the word of the inert material from these five elements on the right side and from mana shakti on the left side.

Shri Mataji: But one of the five elements is in the left hand side.
Sahaja Yogi: Ether?
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course. Emotions come from ether.
Sahaja Yogi: From?
Shri Mataji: The ether.
Sahaja Yogi: Really?
Shri Mataji: Of course. Where is ether within us?
Sahaja Yogi: Ether is here, Agnya.
Shri Mataji: Not Agnya. Left side.
Sahaja Yogi: Not, not Vishuddhi?
Shri Mataji: Mmmm?
Sahaja Yogi: Not Vishuddhi. Agnya.
Shri Mataji: Vishuddhi is left side. You see, Krishna was, was a left-sided fellow, you know?
Sahaja Yogi: That’s why He’s dark.
Shri Mataji: Born at twelve o’clock in the night.
Sahaja Yogi: On that Krishnapaksha.
Shri Mataji: Krishnapaksha.
Sahaja Yogi: So, ether is here.
Shri Mataji: Ether is at Vishuddhi.
Sahaja Yogi: Ha, absolutely.
Shri Mataji: Ether is at Vishuddhi, we should say.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, that’s right.
Shri Mataji: But actually we call it, it’s a combination done. The ether is at every chakra, on the left hand side.
Sahaja Yogi: I see. But predominates at Vishuddhi.
Shri Mataji: So it is at every chakra, ether. It’s the counter action.

Sahaja Yogi: Carbon is in the center.
Shri Mataji: Carbon is in the center.
Sahaja Yogi: Oxygen on the right.
Shri Mataji: And hydrogen on the left.
Sahaja Yogi: And helium, so giving the ether. Thank God, it’s all so simple.
Shri Mataji: As [unclear] as that. So hydrogen comes to us from moon. [Aside: He’s going to Arneau.] See [now/how], the earth was created and was first taken close to the moon. So it froze. And when it froze then they brought it [up/away] because the moon is the cause of freezing, brought it closer to the sun. Then it got the oxygen in it. When it got oxygen it was brought in the center. So it had oxygen and hydrogen according to the proportions needed to create the life.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, they say the moon was flung out from the earth.
Shri Mataji: Flung out from the earth? In a way it is flung out, but that part of moon was frozen. In a way, I mean, you see, flunging out also is a relative term.
Sahaja Yogi: Which was flung out of which we do not know.

Shri Mataji: That’s the question. Which came first is the “but”, that’s...
Sahaja Yogis: Yes, yes.
Shri Mataji: So the Moon, the Earth was closer to the moon first, and then it separated. Very close. It sucked actually hydrogen and that’s how it has no temperature. Or where is the hydrogen coming from? What is the source of hydrogen?
Sahaja Yogi: You said the moon, Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Hmmm, moon because I said it. It’s the earth because earth has sucked that hydrogen from the moon.
Sahaja Yogi: They said that the sun is ninety per cent hydrogen, Mataji.
Shri Mataji: It is. It is ninety per cent. But the hydrogen that is on the Mother Earth is from the moon.
Sahaja Yogi: And then likewise is the oxygen from the sun?
Shri Mataji: From the sun.
Sahaja Yogi: Then water is a combination of left and right side.
Another Sahaja Yogi: And the evolution is a combination of all four.
Sahaja Yogi: And, and proteins are...
Shri Mataji: No, no, carbon. First the Mother Earth creates carbon. You see, [if She puts]... How carbon is created by Mother Earth, it’s very interesting. She does it and producing carbon within Herself and that carbon becomes the holding bondage between hydrogen and oxygen. And that’s how the life starts.
Sahaja Yogi: Then Mother Earth, Mataji, must then be like the Adi Devi.
Shri Mataji: Of course.
Sahaja Yogi: And the other Goddess, how do you say? [Adi Sanjuni, Adi Sanjuni is there].
Shri Mataji: This is, is the first Yogini, we should say.
Sahaja Yogi: Adi Yogini.
Shri Mataji: Sahaj Yogini.
Sahaja Yogi: No, no.
Shri Mataji: Now, but I must say, I must give, I have given a name to, to Tony’s mother or to Tony’s baby. And what is the name I gave? That “a” are for him, Anthony, and “d” for [Dolly]. Now tell Me what name is the best?
Sahaja Yogi: I, second one.
Shri Mataji: And he is the first Sahaja Yogi. So...
Sahaja Yogi: Aditi name. Adi is something.
Shri Mataji: Ha, Adi is something.
Another Sahaja Yogi: And is needed.
Shri Mataji: The first name of the Goddess.
Sahaja Yogi: Aditi is the first name.
Shri Mataji: Aditi is there, the Mother one.
Sahaja Yogi: Durga.
Shri Mataji: Adya.
Sahaja Yogi: Achcha. Oh, what a name [it is].
Another Sahaja Yogi: [Must give] some names from the Mother Earth, Ma.
Shri Mataji: Tell Me from, from where to where is going? We have started on what?
Sahaja Yogi: But You see, there’s a reason Mataji. We are supposed to be doing Puja to Mother Earth on Monday. That is why is necessary.
Shri Mataji: That is your own idea.
Sahaja Yogi: There wasn’t mine. It was their idea. I told it.
Shri Mataji: On the [Hindi] we are here, we can have.
Sahaja Yogi: Then we are doing something else.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Mother, Mother, you are coming to the next chakra after Mooladhara. It seems to be introduced this idea of ether.
Shri Mataji: No, you developed on this. I’ve given you the basics. I mean, if I go on to talk to on one chakra I can talk for the whole day in this house.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yeah, sure.

Shri Mataji: Now, Swadishthana.
Sahaja Yogi: Not, Nabhi, surest thing.
Shri Mataji: Swadishthana. Let’s see, the Swadishthana. There’s another element. Now you started with two, three elements, the Mother Earth element. And it started. Swadishthana it started. One side, another side more. You see, in every chakra there’s a...
Sahaja Yogi: There’s a, a place for each chakra.
Shri Mataji: There’s a - what you call the - we can say the juxtaposition. But only one thing is in juxtaposition. Is the Moon. And the subtlest of the moon is the Atma, the Spirit. Because it is the witness. Moon is the witness of the Mother Earth.
Sahaja Yogi: [unclear]
Another Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Another Sahaja Yogi: In vibrations.
Shri Mataji: In the vibrations. He’s just enjoying.
Sahaja Yogi: [No matter/For a doctor] is a very subtle thing.
Shri Mataji: No, no, I am not for doctors. But for Sahaja Yogis I am saying. So in everything whether it is earth, it is a moon, there’s a... When the moon comes, you see, the Mother Earth goes into [joy].
Sahaja Yogi: She rejoices.
Shri Mataji: She rejoices. When it is a, any moon has big [influence] on Mother Earth, on water, on every condition.
Sahaja Yogi: On [assi].
Shri Mataji: Everyone. I mean all these lunatic asylums and all that.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s the opposite.
Shri Mataji: Opposite.
Another Sahaja Yogi: But I, it was very few.
Shri Mataji: Too much of it.
Sahaja Yogi: Bring here the other ones.
Shri Mataji: Like there are too much of lunatics. I mean, when lunar comes on the [earth]. You see, people knew about it, definitely.
Sahaja Yogi: When I was a young registry, Mataji, the person who was on duty on the full moon night, all had a very bad time. Used to avoid, used to change rather duties in order to avoid full moon.
Shri Mataji: Full moon. On, on also the Amavasya.
Sahaja Yogi: Ha, Amavasya, another bad night, that is true.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Amavasya.
Shri Mataji: That is one of the worst. It is again the both sides. Everything has two sides, you should see. Full moon is as bad as Amavasya. Some people have bad effects on Amavasya and some have on full moon.
Sahaja Yogi: On Amavasya, Mataji, we want to do a Kali Puja.
Another Sahaja Yogi: This thing I was saying. All to bath in the big Yamuna.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, we are laughing with you not at you.
Shri Mataji: Yes but instead of Kali Puja, Bhairava...
Sahaja Yogi: Because that is... Bhairava.
Shri Mataji: But you see you can do Bhairava’s Puja and then Kali. [unclear] the central nervous system.
Sahaja Yogi: The another worshipped it was Kali. Right?
Shri Mataji: I don’t have any objection to attend it if the Paramchaitanya is ahead. Bhairava, to worship Bhairava, means to be a complete...
Sahaja Yogi: Pure.
Shri Mataji: Only children can do it.
Sahaja Yogi: Only thing Bhairava, He [was] simple and wise. For Puja there is a very beautiful environment propitiating the, the act of bhakti?
Another Sahaja Yogi: But I, but I used to feel the vibrations lift a little when I used to do the Kali Pujas here. I must say there was tremendous joy which come up here because there was something tremendous here.
Shri Mataji: He’s the killer of all the anti-joy.
Sahaja Yogi: Tremendous joy.

Another Sahaja Yogi: So it would be good for. It’s right Mooladhara coming.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother what is the element of Swadishthana please? You said that it is in juxtaposition with?
Shri Mataji: No, no, all elements.
Sahaja Yogi: All of them are there?
Shri Mataji: Yes, have to.
Sahaja Yogi: Which are predominant?
Shri Mataji: Surya and Moon. One side is Surya; another side the Moon.
Sahaja Yogi: And in the center?
Shri Mataji: In the center is the subtler side of the Mother Earth.
[Hindi]
Sahaja Yogi: What is the element that protects the moon, Ma?
Another Sahaja Yogi: Moon is the [unclear], it controls all of them.
Shri Mataji: All right. So now we come to the... what is the Arneaux called this?... I told you yesterday was [Hindi]. [Hindi] So left and right. [Hindi]
Sahaja Yogi: You can go on distribute, supply anything, yes or no?
Another Sahaja Yogi: Paul said to me I will supply the [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: What do you produce, what do you produce in the winter? What do that [whole] moon that is produced giving the [words] of the?
Another Sahaja Yogi: A beautiful moonstone is produced.
Sahaja Yogi: In the word of [unclear] manner.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Namely in the art of [unclear].
Shri Mataji: And is...
