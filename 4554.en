H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, Letter for Navaratri, London (United Kingdom), October 3rd, 1978, (Translation from Marathi)

To

All Sahaja Yogis,

Many blessings

Today is the first day of Navaratri.

Today your attention should be on Shri Ganesha. His devotion is infinite. He has never worshipped anybody else but Mother, hence He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong and each has some speciality.

What is Mother’s speciality? Her ego is never felt by others. Hence Shri Ganesha who has surrendered to such a Mother, is so wise and venerable.

Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with ‘Ni’: Nishakanchan – without wealth, Nirlepa – untaintent, unattached; Nirvichara – without thoughts; Nishprayojana – without motives, Nigarvita (Nirahamkara?) – without ego, Niriccha – without desires etc. Therefore, surrendering to such a Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought because Mother has nothing with Her and therefore nothing can be asked from Her. 

It shows how Shri Ganesh by himself, is fully satisfied. Where does this contentment of Shri Ganesh come from? It is His own power. When the gate of the Self opens, nothing else is required. It is the Mother who opens this gate and therefore She is so dear to Shri Ganesh.

After attaining the stage of complete Self-realisation, nothing else is required. Thereafter, exists only the enjoyment of the bliss and the satisfaction of complete fulfilment.

You are made in the pattern of Shri Ganesh, therefore, your power is unmatched. But for that, you should have devotion and innocence like Shri Ganesh. Then Mother would admire you and the whole world would witness that beautiful sight.

I have worked in the operation and Ida Nadi of all has become much lighter. Ida means past and all good and bad impressions. All that is bad should be removed like cleaning of an excellent cloth that gets back its colour and new look thereafter.

But right side improves by discipline. I myself will observe fasting and clean your right side, so that your power to do the work increases and you start Sahaja Yoga work with new vigour.

However, left side can be kept, clean by discriminating between good and bad deeds and strictly doing only that which is good. That means you have to do only that which is auspicious and helpful.

Right side can be activated by discipline.

Balance is very important in Sahaja Yoga. The age old saying, Ati Sarvatra Varjayet (extremes should be avoided everywhere) is very true.

I am very eager to meet you all.

Your Mother Nirmala
