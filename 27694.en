1:15:51 [Shri Mataji] Then in the 2nd group people didn't get ghongris (blanket), but they have got I think you have got, I gave you the shawls, the extra shawls, I don't know who has the extra shawls, they are not yet brought i think but we can get them or you can collect them from someone who has got it
1:16:24 [Shri Mataji] Alright, who has got the extra shawls, who has collected the extra shawls, extra shawls no no 
1:16:41 [Shri Mataji] Alright, all the nation group leaders have to distribute, there are three more left out, those who have got less three they should take it also there are ghongris (blanket) which must be given to the national group people who have to distribute to their own people who have come for the 2nd group, that should be collected from every national group leader
1:17:06 [Shri Mataji] ghongris (blanket), No no they are here, from the 2nd group, so we keep all these together, now you should see your national group leader will be coming just now one after another, so you will know who is the national group leader, now can somebody announce 
1:17:31 [Shri Mataji] and all the men have to get their white dhotis, now these dhotis can be worn  tomorrow after bath if you like for puja or for marriages whichever way you like, but we will give, we have given distributed most of them but those who haven't got it can take it from Harsh, but don't take 2, it has got 2 pieces one to cover yourself up  and one for wearing  but for the married couple we will give you all the things tomorrow, tomorrow  morning we are going to have the haldi (Turmeric) at about 9:30 or so about breakfast time on the sea beach then we will have after the haldi we'll give you, the girls will be given all their presents and the boys will be given all their presents, they have to dress up  by about say I don't know what time you start but be ready about fiveish because we are getting the bullock carts for you, for the boys  and for the girls so we'll  all tell you  tomorrow all about it, but today is the day for all the leaders and centers to come in for the silver that is given by me to all the centers
1:19:04 [Shri Mataji] Also I have given Shri Ganesha to every one of you as a present, all of you 
1:19:14 [Shri Mataji] Which could be taken from your group leaders so every group leader must know how many people they have accordingly they must take Shri Ganesh from Harsh, this is the one I am giving it  to you, and should collect the ghongris (blanket) as well as the shawls from your group leaders, the people who have come now so now we'll  have the people from our centers for the sliver, one after another

1:19:54 [Sahaja Yogi] Before we distribute this I want you to know first of all that Shri Mataji has spent a lot of time choosing these presents, it’s a remarkable event that's been taking place in the background and she has spent days together and she has been working it out and got absolutely beautiful things not only for the centers, we offer some small amount in puja but what she spends I can’t believe it frankly it’s impossible to believe I just have to turn my eyes away from the accounting part of it because it’s an impossibility, actually for the marriages the married couple let’s take that as an example the marriage couples are paying 1,500, she is spending 4,500, this is almost unbelievable, but it’s just indicative of our divine mother
1:21:04 [Shri Mataji] No no ,I, 2000 is coming out of you people it’s true

1:21:11 [Sahaja Yogi] mother no accounting explanation, any way this is first of all a list of silver which mother has very generously but for all the centers
1:21:22 [Shri Mataji] But yet I have not yet given to the Indian, that I will be doing later on, just only for the, this is only for the western and Australian centers, Indians I have to still.

2:15:46 [Shri Mataji] I went to Bolivia, and to my amazement I found they had the Condor as the emblem of their Navy, so I asked them why do you have Condor as the emblem of your Navy, so they said that there is a saying among our old aboriginal people that a God called Vishnu came on a Condor from Bharat our country India to Bolivia.
<In Hindi Translation  start>I had gone to Bolivia, so I asked the people that why is the Navy having Condor as the Flag, why do you believe in Condor, the symbol was Condor, So they told the aboriginal, very old aboriginal tell that from your country means from Bharat (India) God Vishnu he came on Condor, We were amazed hearing it, the country from where Vishnu ji came on Condor, these people have come from that country<In Hindi Translation end>

<In Marathi Translation  start>There is one country called Bolivia, I had visited there, their Navy flag is symbol was Condor, so how I asked what was the link with Sea and Condor, they told no, God Vishnu from your country came here this is what our aboriginals told so we use Condor as our Symbol, means in that country at some time Vishnu would have travelled in Condor, that's they told us and we were surprised how they know Vishnu's name and he travelled on Condor how do they know that, now on Condor <In Marathi Translation end>
2:18:16 [Shri Mataji] the Condor is spreading its wings [UNCLEAR] for the wings of liberty, wake up my Indian people and stir the flame of the inner self, the mother is calling you to your freedom, there in the valley of the Andes, clad in flaming red of the Volcano, Panchmaha, the Mother Earth, you call it, you call it a Pachmaha

Mother earth is Pachamama, Pachamama,Mother earth is boiling with full fury, the roots are burned out, open are the branches of the new tree of the life of the Latin America continent

2:28:37 [Sahaja Yogini] Shri Mataji we would like to present you this song as a song of great gratefulness, and in fact, we went to SaptaShrungi and we were climbing the mountains  and going down this mountain there were about to be dark and it was very dangerous because the Sun was  going down and there was no light at all and we had hardly any pocket lamps so at a moment we prayed you and just the Sun was away he went down and we prayed you with faith and suddenly I saw my shadow on the stones and I was amazed because there was no Sun, so I looked upon me and there was a very thin quarter of the moon

2:29:33 [Shri Mataji] what

2:29:37 [Sahaja Yogini] A quarter of the moon, but so shiny that it gave light like the full moon and we could go down safely all these rocks and stones without any difficulty just by this very tiny crescent of Moon, Jai Shri Mataji

2:39:32 [Sahaja Yogi] By the blessings of Shri Mataji, Sri Baburao Parkhe and his troop they have come from Kolhapur to offer you a program known as gondhal. Those who have visited in here earlier trip Kolhapur and Sangli they know what is gondhal, gondhal is a prayer to Adi Shakti you pray Adi Shakti or Maha Lakshmi or Jagdamba or Maha Kali and request her and pray her for the betterment of any function or any program, now Baburao Parkhe is an Ex-Mayor of Kolhapur he has, he has devoted more than 25 years to this art of gondhal and now this year they are completing 25 years for their own organization known as Hanuman Bal Hanuman Mandal, 25 years they have been practising this and serving the society in addition to their normal social service, I will request all the Sahaja yogi's here and the friends to be very patient and enjoy this gondhal who have come all the way from Kolhapur.

<In Marathi> for our Marathi folks I request that these gondhali groups have come all the way from Kolhapur for Shri Mataji's program, some songs of Shri Mataji were already instructed to them, not only this, before this they have performed 2 programs earlier and have recognized the blessings of Shri Mataji, this is a very big blessing which they also acknowledge and have come here by themself. They have also requested to invite them for future Shri Mataji's program and so we have invited them, now their Bal Hanuman Mandal and especially for this gondhal sacred task, Baburao Parkhe has dedicated to it, he has managed to balance other social work and this special art Baburao  Parkhe and his team maintained and nurtured, all here enjoy the performance and Adi Shakti to bless them

2:42:39 [Baburao]  Adi Maya Shakti Mataji and all devotees, we are blessed to perform at  Mataji's feet second time in Ganpatipule, We start with a prayer of Shri Ganaraya (Ganesha), today once again in this Mother place we have got an opportunity to offer our services at  Mataji's feet, On Mataji's birthday we had an invitation but we couldn't get to Mumbai, but today in this place all the artists, all the devotees, all the children, her child and on behalf of all children I offer flower garland at Mataji's feet, our performance may be haphazard and naive, with the blessings of Mataji I am sure you will enjoy and will take your devotion towards your ascent, with this assurance once again reiterating couldn't go to Mataji's Birthday and with offering Flower garland to Mataji's feet we start this performance.

2:44:24 [Shri Mataji] What a Luck, that my children are sitting in front of me and appealing, it is a divine fortune

2:44:47 <Song starts>

2:59:18 [Baburao] The poet who is blessed by Mataji's inspiration and today thru this song we will now express the love of Mataji, now at Mataji's feet

3:00:07 [Sahaja Yogi] Jai Mataji
