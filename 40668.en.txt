A TV Interview, Istanbul, Turkey, 18.04.1998

Interviewer: Sahaja Yoga, It's founder is now in Turkey and speaking only with us. Who is she? Shri Mataji. Listen to what she is saying.

Shri Mataji: All those watching me, if they have a desire,  should open their hands like this. Put your right hand on your heart and say inside, "Mother, I am not this mind, this body, these feelings, these conditionings". I am the pure spirit.  We are carrying a feeling  of guilt inside.  But it is harmful to this center here.  Now stretch your right hand towards Me like this.  and put your left hand above your  head.  And see carefully if you feel a cool or a hot breeze  You can close your eyes if you like.  Now stretch your left hand towards Me.  and check with your right hand above your head.  Do you feel a cool or a hot breeze?  You can move your hand slowly up or down.  Now raise your both hands.  And ask one of these questions from your heart.

Mother, is what I have felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?  Or Mother, is this the Spirit?  Or Mother, is this the all pervading power of Divine Love?  Now look at Me but don't think.  And you will feel a cool or a hot breeze on your hands.  also  you can feel it above your fontanel bone area.  This is the moment when your spirit starts to grow.
