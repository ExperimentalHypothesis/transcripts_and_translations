Talk to yogis. Dollis Hill ashram, London, England. 20 June 1979.

Then he starts treating people.  Then he passes negativity more and it starts appearing to be something good, you see.  Sometimes you also feel such a desire to acquire more powers because these spirits are very cunning and they establish that kind of an atmosphere.  So one has to be careful. You see, there’s a regular warfare going on. And that’s why we have to just keep our spirits all right. And cowardice has no place in this war. 

The whole thing will work out very well if people are identified with the truth. But truth, as you know, is very difficult to identify with, very difficult for human beings, absolutely next to impossible.  If you tell them to be idiots, they’ll accept it.  If you tell them to be stupid, they’ll accept it.  Any sort of a thing that makes them look absolutely donkeys, they will do it.  If you tell them to be false, they will do it.  If you create any atmosphere of falsehood, they’ll accept it.  But the truth? Very difficult, very difficult. Even you may know that some people will see my photograph, all right?  And they get the cool breeze.  But when they see Me fully, they cannot.  Because when they see the photograph there’s a lot of darkness still in them.  So they believe into Me because of that part of that is darkness, because I’m just a photograph.  But as soon as they see Me they just don’t want to accept Me. 

We had a very nice place in Delhi.  I asked Gregoire to go and speak to the girls of Delhi University, him being a young white person and handsome and all that.  They were all very much impressed. [INAUDIBLE] when he was saying that there’s somebody like that they were feeling the vibrations all right.  But when they came to Me, they never felt any vibrations.  Just imagine, from Gregoire they were feeling, not from Me.  But then they recovered from it and now they are much better off.  This was the thing.  So because of this, you see, the people who represent darkness and falsehood are more successful.  The spiritualists are much more successful than a saint.

Someone makes a comment: “I never had to pay any money.” 

This can be also because they do not know; they’re well intentioned and they think they've got powers.  They assume it.  And by that they have a satisfaction to say that we are doing good to others.  But they do not know the know-how, you see.  That is the point because here the people are not that cunning as we have in India.  If they know that they are doing harm they will not do it. We have very cunning people in our country.  Even if they know they are doing harm, still they will do it if they get some money out of it.  So they haven’t got any conscience about it at all.  Here if the people see that they have done good to someone then they start believing it, you see, thinking they have powers, this, that.  Because sometimes also they get a vision, sometimes they get a feeling.  All these things can be there due to these spirits coming in, you see. 

In India it is a very common experience of many people.  They worship a deity all the time, and suddenly they find that the garland that they put into the neck of the deity gets up from there and comes into their own necks.  Then they think, “Now God has accepted us as great saints.”  This is their idea.  Now it is nothing but some dissatisfied soul, you see, puts it on them.  And they start believing into it, that it is God who has done it.  Then they will start a big place and they will announce to everyone that, “I am a saint and this will happen and that will happen.”  And people are also impressed you see, with this kind of thing.  And they would again ask this thing to happen.

There are people who start getting this red kumkum from their hands, you see, flowing.  So people believe into it.  They think that yes, must be something great otherwise how can this red powder flowing from their hands?  Or sometimes ashes start [flowing]. And we have got, say in Bombay we have a temple, we have a temple of Mahalakshmi and they think that Mahalakshmi temple is the place where the Goddess resides.  No doubt there is a very genuine temple, I would say not temple, but even the statue is absolutely genuine.  But the people who are there are so funny that they get hold of some maid servants you see, and then spirits comes into them. They start doing, “Hhhmmm, hhhuuu,” like that.  This is called as [sounds like –dhagini terrini] means there’s a big pot you get for water. And in that water they go on saying, “Huuuun, huuuun,” inside the water.  And they get those spirits into them and then they go on, “Huuuun, huuuun,” like that.  All the people go on like that - all these maid servants.  And then these people come and ask them questions. Like what is the horse we are going to get?  Where is my brother?  All this, and they answer. Then they believe into it.  So they get some money.  But these women are horrible women in their own lives and they are always sick and they are very unhappy.  But they believe into it.  They believe into all these things and they do it. And while doing it, they don’t know that they are doing anything wrong but they get sick and they are very, very unhappy and ultimately they die a very bad death.

There was one like that in Poona, whom they called as Mamaji, means uncle.  And he was a very, very famous man in Poona.  Even the police used to use that man for doing this spirits' job.  But they knew that these were spirits and these are not Gods. Only these women, the way they do it, they think it is the Goddess has come into them.  Now Goddess should have some sense to come into these horrible women, isn’t it?  But people don’t think about it; so they believe into it.  But this man, this gentleman who was in Poona, because I was staying with the police commissioner there, the police commissioner called him.  And so he came and he told Me, "Mother, I really wanted to meet You for one reason that I’m now fed up of these spirits that I’ve used, and if You could get rid of them I’ll be very happy, because now I'm being tortured by them.  And I know what sort of a death I’m going to have.  They are going to eat my flesh one by one and I’m going to die much earlier before my death, the way they will torture my life.” So all this, you see, he was frightened about because he had seen other also people who did this kind of work, tantrikas, suffering.  So he was very much frightened. 

So I said, “All right, then you ask for the parama, means the highest. You ask for that superior thing, superior most.”  

He said, "All right, I ask for it." 

I said, "All right, say thrice that you ask for it." 

He said, "Yes, give me that, Mother.  Give me that.  Give me that."  I said, "All right, I give you that."  And he got his realization.  So he got the vibrations and all that. 

I said, “Now you have lost all these horrible bhoots and their powers and now you have your own powers coming in and they will act. Your own powers will act which you can be able to maneuver and help others.”  He could not believe in Me you see. He thought that whatever he had for twenty-five years, how can he get rid of them just like this? So he went to the police commissioner and told him that, "Oh, Mataji is telling me like this. I don’t believe it. I can always call the spirits." The police used to use him you see, for detecting crimes and things. So he said, "All right, if you think so why not call one of the spirits? Say your mantra." He started saying mantra. Nobody would come in. He tried for half an hour, nobody would come in. He said, “Do you mean to say I’ve lost all that"? He said, “Yes.” He said, “Now thank your stars you will have better death at least.” That’s how it works out.

But even in Sahaja Yoga you will be surprised, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga , even in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga…. 

So it so happened that I went to America. Before going to America I told this lady that, "You are all right but your guru has been doing all these tricks of spirits. So you will get those spirits into you and it will try to entice you, because they don’t want to give up their people. They have no freedom and once they try to get out, they just try to again entice you.” 

So she told Me, "No no, You just don’t worry about me Mother I will keep myself all right.”  Then you know, in her own house she started a centre, put up My big photograph. And people who come to her and she started first giving them Sahaja Yoga and this and that. Then suddenly she started feeling something falling from her hands, and they were some rice, the rice which is being reddened by this kumkum. We call it as akshata. And she was so surprised at it that it has started falling from her hands. And gradually everybody was surprised and they said lots of people started coming to her. Then they started asking her questions like, “Where is my brother? Where is my father?  What is the horse?” this, that.  And she started answering that, that, “You know this horse is going to win this race,” and they won that race. One fellow had put lot of money somewhere and he had forgotten about it, in a big house. So she told also where is the money.  They were all very much impressed, you see, because they are very materialistic people.  They are only interested in what money we are going to get or what health problems they have.  They are not interested in Self-realization. Very, I should say, low graded people they are.  So they were just worried about this, not worried about Self-realization. And all such people started coming to her who were not interested in Self-realization, but in all these things.  And she became very popular; she became so popular that there were, sometimes used to be three thousand people. And she had to take a hall and this and that. 

And I came to know about it somehow within Myself and I immediately sent a telegram saying that, “Please stop all that nonsense and please don’t do all this.” And she could not believe Me. Then when I went to India about a month later, you see, she had not yet stopped. And by that time what had happened, she said, "No, Mataji came to me and she told me that to carry on and I saw her standing before me, she said so," and all that. In that short time that I was there, I mean one month or so I was not there, she started using a big birch you see and a big stick to hit people, to take out their devils, she said. And she used to hit them back very badly on their backs. And it was so horrible that some people broke their backs and all sorts of things happened and she was using a stick. And sometimes a very flexible one, you see, so that they would get marks on their body. By the time I reached, you see. And she came to see Me and some of the Sahaja Yogis joined hands with her. 

It was so silly that I just could not understand how these people all joined hands with her.  And then she came to Me and she said, “I’ve started a very good organization in Your name Mother. You must come. You must come.” So I told the Sahaja yogis, “None of you need come. I’ll go Myself.” So I went down. She came and she opened the door of My [INAUDIBLE/thing] and she washed My feet and lots of water she brought and she then washed My feet with milk and all sorts of things.  I was just feeling very embarrassed you know, of the whole thing. I didn’t know what to do. I went up to the room and she made Me sit down there and all these people were singing My praise. It was very embarrassing. Everywhere I could see all these horrible, these spirits sitting down there, you know, and mocking at her. I said, “[INAUDIBLE] you are going to [INAUDIBLE] great [INAUDIBLE].” And you know I didn’t know what to do and how to tell them that they. And then they started, “Hoooon, oooon.” I said, “Had it now here.” I said, “All right, I'm all right. I’m going back.” She said, “We’ll do your puja.” I said, “No, no, you are not well. I’m going back home, you come and see Me.” 

She was very happy. Next day she came, she thought I am going to say, "Oh, bravo. You have done very well." So when she came and sat next to Me I said, “Now see.”  She said, “Mother, see how many powers You have given me. I am so powerful.” I said, "Really?  I must say you have some powers isn’t it?" She said, “Yes.” I said, “All right, will you tell this gentleman about him?”  So she started telling him that, “You were born in such a place and you have a house like this.” He said, “Not me. It’s not me, you are telling about somebody else.” And there was a lady sitting there. She said, “You are a person who has got a clerk in your business who is like this, whose name is this.” She said, "I don’t have a business. I don’t have a clerk.” She looked at Me. She said, "Mother, have you taken away all my powers?" I said, "If they were your powers I would have respected you and loved you. But these were somebody else's powers. As soon as you have entered into My house they have left you completely. And now you go back you can get them back again unless and until you say that I want the eternal, the eternal, and eternal. And after this you have to be very, very particular and watch yourself, your attention, whether you are accepting these negativities or not." She said, "Yes, I want the eternal, eternal and eternal." She was all right. She went back home and she was all right for about fifteen days. 

But you see, popularity of that kind is very difficult. To avoid the temptations, you see. That’s why it is said, “Lead us not into temptations,” with that same thing, “but deliver us from evil.” The same evil, because evil is standing in every corner and watching us. And she fell into this. And when she fell into this, she started another organization of her own. She started this and that and she is so [INAUDIBLE sounds like frantic]. Nowadays, for your information, she is a very serious patient in a lunatic asylum.

So human beings are like that. They take to such things. I mean, that time only about one hundred and fifty or two hundred people used to come and meet Me, while she was getting three thousand. People want darkness, they want falsehood, they want that somebody should hoodwink them, they want somebody should befool them. They want to live with the befooling, you see. And those who know this and know how to handle it, they will just keep you on the run, you see. They will keep you on the run all the time that they befool you from this place to that place and that place to that place. 

Now, there can be people who are extremely simple-hearted.  But the simplicity goes to this limit that they cannot recognize the reality.  You have to be in the centre. Otherwise you can become a simpleton.  And that simpleton-ness can really be very killing. But if the person is say, very intelligent, who relies on the intelligence, then they will be [inaudible/ unreal?].  They’ll pump up your ego.  They’ll do this and do that and somehow or the other they will get you there because they are extremely cunning people.  They are the embodiment of cunningness.  So you cannot outwit them because whatever intelligence you have is limited while they have such a lot of intelligence of such a crooked nature that you cannot go to their level.  After all, you have your conscience with you.  So they have no conscience.  They play about so much that they really hoodwink you and you do not know about it. 

And that's how you will find that all the incarnations who came on this earth were killed, crucified, poisoned, like Mohammed Sahib was poisoned, or harassed, or sent to forests like Rama, and Krishna tortured by many rakshasas who went to kill him. All sorts of things.  I mean, there is no incarnation who has not suffered.  So that now people think that if you do not suffer you cannot go to God.  See this is another madness people have, that you must suffer to go to God.  So they are all carrying the cross.  It was for Christ to carry the cross, not for you.  So there is no need for you to be that miserable and take the sufferings of the people.  There is no need at all to suffer.  There is no need at all to unnecessarily torture your bodies, unnecessarily torture your being to such a limit that you are absolutely useless for the day when you are going to be crowned. 

So this is what I tell you, that falsehood is easily acceptable to people.  People accept falsehood with such gusto and with such force and they do not even see what is happening.  They just rush to it because we have lived with it.  First of all we have lived with matter.  We are identified with it because we have lived with it, because we do not know what is the truth.  We have lived with untruth.  We have lived with the dreams. We have not lived with awakened state.  We are not yet identified with that awakened state. That’s why you are awakened, then you go off to sleep., Again you are awakened; again you go off to sleep. You are more identified with sleep than with awakened state. That’s why it happens all the time. Sometimes people say, "Mother, Sahaja Yoga also when we get realization again we go down.” But what can we do? You see, it’s not the responsibility of Sahaja Yoga that it should just shoot you off to that place.  It is also your responsibility in a way that if you have had problems within you and there are pouches and ditches where you are physically hurt, mentally hurt, everybody hurt, so then what happens?  That power which has really touched on top goes back and tries to stand up.  It happens like that so nothing to feel bad. It will again come up.  It has to make your instrument all right because your instrument has gone into horrible things. 

Especially very funny habits one develops by these horrible devils coming into them. Even a person, if he drinks too much, then know that he is possessed.  If a person he talks very much, or he jabbers, or is harsh, then know that he’s possessed.  All the time if he has a habit to snap at someone, shout at someone, or strict at someone then know that he is a possessed man.  Or if he has a habit to be quiet unnecessarily, you see, tries to be quiet all the time, then know that he is possessed.  Any extreme behavior is only caused by spirits.  Actually what happens that when we go to the extremes our human awareness cannot bear it.  Then what happens that we just ask for help from outside.  And there are many busybodies around.  They just enter into you and start munching.  There is no need to strain your being so much, to go to extremes.  You have to be just in the centre. 

Actually, this country or any of the western countries, I thought, could have been very good for you because you are saints and that you would have lived with a very temperate [sounds like temparent] life.  There was not such problems as we had in India or in any other developing countries.  I thought you will be much better off here, but on the contrary what I find: the material life that provided everything for you made a slave out of you. You even have habits of matter.  Now when you have habits of matters there are some other habits can be put into you.  And the habits that are put into you by these…

Any man who has left no sense of, you can say, the dharma, or of his balances is a man who is possessed.  Anyone who is doing a crime which he does not understand is also possessed.  Or a human being, say a man having a relation with a man, is possessed condition.  If a woman has relations with a woman, it is a possessed condition.  It is not a condition of a normal person.  And human beings have to be normal human beings.  If a woman, if she doesn’t care for her chastity and she leads a fast life that means she is possessed.  If she goes about with many men that means she is possessed.  If the men do that they are also possessed.  They cannot be normal people who do all this. 

You see, whatever are the sustenance of human beings are also the powers of human beings.  Like that we can see the people who are in the centre, the people who are sustained, they do not have all these temptations.  I mean, they just don’t like it; they are just normal people. And that is what one loses gradually by doing extremities.  And you don’t even realize.  The whole society could be like that, possessed, with ideas. We can see what foolish things we are doing in this country.  I know in India they do all sorts of nonsensical things.  But like telling lies, and cheating people, fraud and all that is very common in India. 

But here the other things are there.  Like the way we are wasting our energy in nonsensical things about sex and about flirting and all this nonsense.  Flirting is nothing but a virus infection of sex.  You see, your eyes are caught up.  Really, it is the infection of the eyes, and it comes into the eye, you see.  Then you start looking here and there.  You don’t know what you are doing.  Flirting, if you ask them they have no joy in them.  You just see round, you see one face to another, one woman to another.  Then the woman got it, if the woman gets it you know.  You are just looking like this.  You don’t know why.  It’s a such a waste of energy.  Actually, I didn’t know what was flirting.  But once when I went to America, in seventy three, a young boy came to Me and he said, "Mother, why do I look at all these women?  I waste such a lot of energy.  Why can’t I keep straight?  What is the need to look at them?" They do not know anything.  Any woman passes.  Then the woman also would dress up in such a way that she would attract [inaudible] others.  So that, you see, this is also another kind of fraternity working.  And the whole game starts.  You find even in places like people are above sixty years, they do the same nonsense. Something surprising that even they are not mature, because if you get this poison into you then you do not mature.  It’s like any fruit, you see, which is infected cannot mature.  It’s an infection.  When it comes into you, you do not mature.  That’s why you find even eighty-year-old people behaving like, just like silly young twenty-five-year-old, you see.  That sort of people you find so common here, where you feel so ashamed and embarrassed.  When a eighty-year-old woman starts telling you about her love affairs you just don’t know where to look. And it’s very common; they boast of it and they talk like that.  Their talking is so funny that you can't imagine.  It’s most embarrassing, the way they talk about things and the way they live. 

There was a lady who told Me, she is a lady from a good family and an ambassador’s wife, and she told Me there is a very great writer here, she was about eighty years of age and she writes lots of books on philosophy and things.  So she invited this lady, the ambassador's wife, for a lunch party.  And she said, "Why lunch? I could come for dinner with my husband." She said "No, no, no, I want you for lunch and give you a nice time.  I’ll get you a boyfriend."  She said, "Are you joking?"  She said, "No, I have one of my own, about twenty-four years.  Of what years’ age do you want?"  She was shocked.  She said, "What? I don’t want all that."  She said, "You must know. You see, you women are no good.  Eastern women are no good.  You must learn how to enjoy life."  She said, "I’m sorry I’m not learning that.”  She just put down the phone.

Now this lady is writing books on philosophy.  See the stupidity to which people are doing.  And she is one of the most successful writers in England.  I don’t know her name.  She didn’t tell Me the name. But this is what it is.  She is successful because she is spreading darkness, because you know people want to live with whatever they were in.  They were in darkness. They were just matter. See, this dead matter is just darkness. It has no awareness in it.  Then the animals have little bit of awareness.  And they come to a point when they are human beings.  They have passed through millions of years with that ignorance and that darkness and they more adhere to it than to something that is beyond.  They only evolve because God's grace is there. Otherwise they would never have evolved.  Because God has put some sort of a seeking in their stomach that for food, for other things, they start evolving.  And when they start evolving they reach the stage of human consciousness. 

Now at human consciousness if I have to say that you have to face the reality, why should you?  You think that if I have to face reality then I have to work for it.  Because that is another thing you have done so far.  You think that you have done something all the time to achieve something.  If you have to achieve something then you must put in effort.  Then you do not want to take that path when you were dark, that we have done nothing to become a human being.  And that if we have to go further we are not to do anything about it.  On the contrary you start running fast, very fast, and if you know the place that you take two running jumps and go to hell.  It’s like that, for example, and you speed up so much on that that you land into difficulties. That’s why it is necessary to understand that you are human beings.  At this time you are given freedom, absolute freedom, because you have to see your own evolution. Because you are free you can see.  If you were part and parcel of God and if He had done for you then you would not have seen it, like animals have not seen it.  But this you have to see and you have to be aware of it.  That’s why you have been given freedom.

If you are not away from Me how will you see Me?  And this is the reason you were separated from the whole, so that you can see that you become the whole, while the animals do not see it because they’re dark.  They are part of the whole, they are looked after, they live like that, they don’t get ego, they don’t get superego, they do not speak up suddenly, they do not do all these things, as you do.  They do not have insurances.  They are sensible, we think.  So we go down to them and want to learn something from them.  And what do we learn from them?  Their sex behavior, imagine.  This is human brain, you know, specially made.  We are clowns.  The way we look at things I don’t know how.  Whatever is to be done we just do in the other way round.  Like what you have to learn from animals that they are one with the whole, the trees are one with the whole.  When there is spring the trees will bring out yellow flowers, when there is the summer they bring out the red flowers, and that’s how they express the colour.  While they are looked after whether they are here or anywhere, they are looked after, the nature looks after them.  There is a circle between them.  If the trees have the leaves they emit carbon dioxide.  Then that has to have a circle again.  So the leaves have to fall down into the ground because nature must take nitrogen from them, and must replace it back to them, to nourish them again so they can go into that cycle of movement and from how it moves from one end to another. How carbon dioxide goes into the air and how it is again reconverted back and how the whole thing is worked out in a cycle is done, but they do not know all about it. 

They do it blindly; absolutely blindly they are doing it, because they’re blind, because they don’t need to know.  Like the small little babies and puppies of the dog, if you see, they are blind; they don’t know how to go about.  They just feel their mother and just go and start sucking the breast and take feeding.  You've seen them, very sweet ones you see.  They can’t see anything.  They just smell something and they go down there and eat.  So the mother looks after them at that time and she does everything that is needed even when they are blind. 

When you are also little children, when this is not covered up, closed, your mother looks after you.  Your father will look after you.  They treat you just like a part of them all the time.  All the time they are worried about you.  Not in modern times, of course.  Modern times are one of the most convoluted times.  But they used to do that.  But you are grown-up.  Then they give you freedom to know that you are grown-up.  And that is how God wants you to know that you have evolved.  You have received your realization.  That you have become what you have become, because you have to now really re-manifest God's powers.  This is the thing we have to understand.  And then we should know what is our role in life, and what are we doing, where are we, how are we placed, what is our position.  This should give you the complete energy to get to the sap and work it out. 

May God bless you.
