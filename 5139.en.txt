It will react to the slightest unrest in the nation; to the slightest imbalance in the society. If he sees a leper on the street, his heart will go out with such sympathy that, through his art, he can create an atmosphere by which social workers, doctors, scientists, and the people in charge of the state will be forced to think of some solution to the problems of leprosy.
