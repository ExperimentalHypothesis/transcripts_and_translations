Well, mine was a strange one because I never expected a present; I expected a reprimand. There was a puja coming up, and I didn't feel worthy of going. I had some sort of negative thoughts, and I forget what it was now, but I just didn't want to go. So my friends at Brenda's all went, and they said, "Come." I said, "No, no, I don't want to go. I feel hypocritical."

So I didn't go. I said, "I've got a lot of baddies." I wasn't sure what baddies were, but it sounded right. So, I didn't go. Anyway, what amazed me was when they got to me... well, you tell the rest of the story, because I was indoors with a hump.

We all sat in front of Shri Mataji, and she said, "Where is your husband?" And I looked 'round and thought, "Oh, he's at home, Mother." So she said, "Tell him he has no baddies. Give him this." It was some white cotton linen to make a good kurta. I couldn't believe it.

You're telling me. I really wouldn't tell you this. I've still got the white cloth, but that's the only present I've ever had.

"Have you had it made into a..."

"No, I've just kept it. It's so pretty. But that was the story."

Which is amazing, because it makes you realize that she knows every effort. That reminds me of when I turned up at a public program one night and I had a terrible left-side problem. I sat right at the back of the hall, as far away from others as I possibly could, and I just sat there. Anyway, at the end of the program, Mother said all the yogis could come up and give her a flower. I thought, "I'm not going anywhere near Mother, not in this state."

So there was a long queue, and we were sitting there waiting for it to go down. I saw a yogi in the queue who I needed to speak to about something, so I thought, "Well, I'll just go and tell him while he's in the queue. It's going to take a while." I started having this conversation with him, and by the time I finished what I was saying, the queue had dwindled. It got close enough to Mother for the vibrations to welcome me in, so I thought I might as well stay here now.

So the queue went down and down and down. Eventually, it got to the chap right in front of me. Mother said to this chap, "Oh, how are you then?" And he said, "I've got a left-side problem now." Mother said, "I beg your pardon?" He said, "I've got a left-side problem now." Mother turned to me and she said, "What did he say?" I said, "He's got a left-side problem now." So Mother worked on him and then got up and went out. She didn't bother to see me.

The other time I remember about presents was when she bought us all ties. It was after a puja up at the Temple of All Faiths, and she bought ties for all the men. She brought these ties out, and they all matched what we were already wearing. I remember someone had a checked shirt, and they brought out this checked tie. It was incredible.

This also has to do with left-sidedness, in India. What an amazing experience. It was in Pune, at a market, and Mother was there. I've already told some people today. She had a few of her relatives there as well. She was going around the market, and as Bernard was saying, I was feeling not very good about myself. I was hoping that Mother wouldn't turn her attention to me. I didn't want to come to her attention or have her ask me how I was or anything like that.

So I was holding back, watching Mother and following, but at a distance. She was absolutely surrounded by people, so I kept walking around. This went on for I don't know how long—three-quarters of an hour or an hour, something like that. Then I got involved in buying some silk paintings at one of the stalls. When I had finished buying them, I looked up, and suddenly there was hardly anyone in the market. Everyone seemed to have gone. My attention had been on that for half an hour. So I relaxed because Mother wasn't there, and she wasn't going to put her attention on me.

I was walking along, and suddenly—there was hardly anyone there—walking towards me was Shri Mataji. Completely alone. She was coming towards me, and I was going towards her. We looked at each other, and I bowed to her. She said, "How are you, Ruth?"

And I said, "I'm fine, thank you, Mother."

And she said, "Just enjoy. Just enjoy." And then she walked past.

When I got back to the camp, I said, "I met Mother at the market, and she spoke to me." They said, "No, that's impossible because she was surrounded by people the whole time she was there. And when she left, she was surrounded by people." I knew how I was feeling and how I was holding back, and she cared.

"Remind us where it was and when."

That was in Pune, and it was in 1988.

"That's amazing."
