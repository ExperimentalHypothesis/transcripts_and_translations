Interview on a Greek TV. 27 April 1993.


J: Journalist,M; Mother.

J:Good evening ,its a very strong feeling that so many time although we are in our own country,tonight we have the opportunity of really make a long travel.A  long travel in wisdom, in distance, in space, in our hearts,and in truth.  This is all the elements that are concentrated in the presence of our Holy Mother that we have invited here, and we are grateful, we have you all the way from one of the oldest civilizations.  In a way we are very proud that we are the members of very old civilization and rarely we realise how other civilizations chime in other places around the world. So we do welcome you here and along with the truth you carry for us.  We would like to ask you about this truth in the way you see in the same world, in other countries that is every country which is in our heart.

M:We have to know one thing, what the truth is.? The truth is actually we are not this body, mind ,intellect, emotions,ego, but we are the spirit and in our evolutionary process we have reached the stage of human awareness and beyond this there is a little break through by which we have to become the SPIRIT. That is very simple and can be done ver easily for people who are seeking the truth.
J:How would you describe the system of your thought, the system that you have brought to our hearts and mind?
M:You will be amazed to know that in Greece people called a bone ,SACRUM, which is the triangular bone and that means they knew that was something sacred about the bone.  Now this bone has got within itself a residual power which is for our connection to the allpervading divine power. All the scriptures has talked about the allpervading divine love and everything ,but we have never felt it before. It is a surprising thing that we take all living things for granted,for our heart beats ,but we do not know how it beats? The flower grows, we don't know how it grows? But if you understand that there is some power which is doing all this living work and the time has come for us to know IT,to feel IT,to understand IT, and also to use IT.
J:How do you think people arrive in the conclusion that they call religion ad what is the connection between this way of approaching  ourselves and the truth which is one and your old tradition in your country which as well as in India?
M: Now in all religion it is written that you have to transform,you have to be born again.  Every religion has said that.  This is not only that any particular religion has said it.  Even Islam has said that you have to become a Wali.  Even Christianity has said that you have to be born again.  I mean there is no religion which has not said that,but it is not just a certificate. You cannot take a certificate that I am born again.  It is something that actualises by which you develop a new state of mind, a state of your being by which you become the SPIRIT and there are powers of the SPIRIT which you manifest. It is not just talking and giving sermons,lectures,but it is something that is an actualisation and it is a living process.
J:I think we Geeks belongs to the world what they call the east part of philosophy and the religion.  This is a system which is mostly esoteric,this is a greek word.  It is a seeking inside and it is quite relevant and close to the very ancient Indian tradition.
M: Of course.
J:Now how close is the Indian old religious system are ! I am talking about the Pagan .  Our own ancestors before the Christianity and even the Jewish or all the Hindu goddess to the best you know.?
M:Specially in Greece you had the ancient system of worshipping the Goddess Athena .  Now in Sanskrit  ATHA means primordial, to us is the Primordial Mother, that we call in our language as Adi Shakti,the Primordial Mother. She has, you must have seen  a snake in the shield and also in her hand that is the symbol of this power within you, which lies dormant in your triangular bone called the sacrum .  So the Greeks knew about it ,no doubt, because otherwise they would not have called her Athena and she must have been,in our scriptures she is described as well, not only that Greece is called as Manipur that is the navel of the universe.
J: Certainly it was a surprise for me to see that you come here to preach our own ancient Gods. What you are telling about Athena ,the serpents ,with greek gods are very familiar creatures and the medicine  and others.  Now what is the message of Athena coming from you again nowadays.?
M:Athena is the one that she is the one who was trying to push her spear into the fontanel bone of Zeus.  Now that is exactly what sahajayoga is.  We think or we believe ,but we have proved that this power which is called Kundalini,because it is like serpent going into coils,because it is the energy which moves like a serpent.  It is more symbolic , you see, that it is not the serpent actually.  So this is the power which is the reflection of Athena within us and when she rises she goes and hits here and opens out the fontanel bone and that is the actualization of baptism,that which is described in Christianity that you are connected with the subtle energy which is the Allpervading . For the first time you start feeling that cool breeze in your hands which is described as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.  The Holy Ghost is the same as Athena , but I think Christians could not connect it with that.  She is the same.
J:We see that all these sanctities along history come and repeat themselves and transfigurate themselves  into traditions of people.  Now you have referred to Yoga and of course in this part of the world we are more or less familiar.  Now for those who are less, I would like you to profound in this yoga and give us some ideas about the wide spectrum of the work ,you would call Yoga.
M:You see Yoga is where you unite,the union between yourself with the divine that the real spiritual yoga,all other yoga is physical yoga and others are the wee part of what one Patanjali wrote. It is just wee part that he wrote to cleanse your body and all that is there.But there is no need now to do all that .  First in the modern times what is it I have done ,work in the first place, people used to get self realisation, alright, but one Master and only one disciple. Gradually it started in a way  that they started talking about it.  From I think,12th century it became more open.  But it has been there years together now when they started talking about it, they could not give amass realisation. They could give only to one person.  So only thing I have done is to workout  the permutation and combination of human nature by which I have understood that How to give amass realisation.  That is the only achievement of Modern Sahaja Yoga.  Sahaja Yoga is an ancient system in India  and, also must have been here because the way the sacrum bone is there and she is having all those things but practice of that may not have been open but in secret . In those days where they have been giving realisation to people, and it is ancient times, thousands of years back and so but in India we have still maintained all that tradition and things and still we respect and worship the Mother Goddess.  Athena means respect.  She is called  Adi Shakti.  The name is different and she is the Holy Ghost according to us.  Now this works out in everyone. It is your own power and it is within you and it works out  and it rises and pierces through your fontanel bone area .  It actualises the experience which is described and thats what one has to feel , otherwise it is just talk talk, talk.  Any religion has become nothing but talk, you see, people are now fed up.  They think what is this promising, claiming and nothing happens to us, but we are just the same ,our forefathers were such and we are just the same, but now the time has come.  The new age  as they say to achieve that state, a new state, where you become. Firstly you become thoughtlessly aware ,means you live in the present.  Thoughts come to you from the past and from the future and dancing on the cusp of thought ,but when this happens the thoughts are separated and in between the thoughts, there is a space we call as the present ,which is reality. Present is the reality because the past is finished and the future does not exist so you live in the present.  When you live in the present ,you start knowing spirituality..  Thats what happens to you that you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands and now it is medically , you know that these endings (Mother shows the finger tips) of the sympathetic nervous system.  What happens is when you get your realisation, you start feeling the cool breeze all along and you start feeling those things on your finger tips.  Now supposing you have a problem  in any one of these centres ,there are seven centres (Mother demonstrates in her hand five six and seven).  Immediately you feel it on your finger tips. You don't have to go to a doctor to diagnose just immediately you know.  Now if you know how to cure, then physically you can be cured, mentally you can be cured also all our human problems or I should say all the world's problems are because of human beings.  All our human problems are because of centres which are within us. So when this power  rises, She nourishes them ,She integrates them and corrects them so we get physical, mental,emotional problems solved and there you achieve your own peace within yourself, but the second thing which  you achieve is a new awareness which is a collective consciousness.  Thats where you can feel not only your own centres but also the centre of others. Now  when you grow spiritually by sitting down here you can feel the centres of any one,sitting down here you can correct the centres of the other people,but you have to grow.But in the beginning you start feeling the Joy of your being because in your heart resides the Spirit. Spirit is the source of joy. It is the source of absolute truth. So you know of the absolute truth. You can feel on your finger and ask any question say, They might say was Christ the son of God? Alright ask the question , immediately you start getting tremendous vibrations .  Surprisingly Athena is also called Pallas, Pallas means vibrations, you see she give vibration. These vibration tells you the absolute truth .  We live in relative world thats why we are fighting , once we are in absolute truth, there is no fight ,no problems.  When  this happens you become collectively conscious and who is the other?Everybody is within your body.  You can feel everyone within yourself so you become a universal personality. This is the character of your spirit, because the spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within  you, which is in everyone. But it is just a witness till you are a realised soul but once you become a realised soul then its start manifesting .  It manifests and you can also raise the kundalini  of others . You can give realisation  to others.  It is like if you enlighten one candle that candle enlighten other candle.  So thats how it spreads
J: This is very interesting.  While you are talking I am writing down certain things that coming in contrast with what we are used to the so called the western world.  I am wondering this  split between body and mind that we suffer.  That is something you do not suffer.  Its wonderful how people in the far east and of course then spirit is not schizophrenic.  How do you explain? How can people come back together with either mind and body, because now in this part of the world ,people who live for the bodies or those who live for their minds? 
M: They are ignorant.   That is why they are in darkness you see.  They think the body is very important but I know of people who have very good body is also coming to me, saying Mother please, give us peace, you see give us joy.  So nobody is satisfied.
J:(interferes) That is the other part which is missing.
M: The whole thing is integrated  in your body ,mind, your lives,ego everything and the ego just disappears. You become egoless . You don't think you are doing anything.  You think it is happening,it just happens.
J:There is another idea that this sort of deep research brings you to the state of absolute and may be in absolute monastic idea,if you are by yourself or the whole world is yourself.  Now listening to you I get the impression that is exactly the opposite,  That you communicate with everybody and that s more of a communal approach than being lonely.  It is a miracle now by coming into yourself you reach out everybody else.  Now I think that you would agree with me ,it is wrong to think of orient is something mystic as something which cut off with the world.
M:No,no it is universal. We are working in 56 nations with Sahaja Yoga .  Specially in Russia surprisingly we have thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis.
J:Very recently.
M:Ya very recently about three years.  Within three years we have got thousands and thousands of them ,you see.  I think in the democratic countries we have too much time to waste.  You see in enjoying all kinds of problems for nothing at all.  While they are , they have given up all these nonsenses.  They thought whatever is available is available ,like ,so there is no solution,  So give it up and thats how they are very introspective I think.  Russia also the Eastern Block people coming in thousands ,who got realisation also. Of course India they know it.  We have thousands .  I must admit that but so many countries like Austria,Italy specially is now so fed up with all this is going on in Italy, that they have taken to Sahaja Yoga. Very strongly and all kinds of people are coming.  So it is something that has to happen and has been predicted.  It is been promised.
J:Now tell me we were referring to countries with very strong tradition in religion ,say Italy is very strong Catholic country , Russia has orthodox past. How about the very different systems like Africa ,like South  America?  You know this is the new world and there is a sharp difference in the approach of thinking in the new world.  How is your message delivered here?
M: You se actually all these incarnations whether it was Christ,Rama, Krishna, Mohammed, any one of them...
J:you call all of them incarnations!
M: All of them were incarnations.  See they were born on the same tree of life of spirituality.  All of them like beautiful flowers at different time but people plucked the flowers and now they are fighting with the dead flowers.  So you see that there is though the religion is within its just outside. Christian-you go to, Mosque-you go to,Temple- you go to you can do anything.  There is nothing inside the religion but with this inside religion awaken and you become righteous,really become an angel, I tell you.
J:  So you tell me, you are an Angel, but still you  live in the world ,and you know there are somethings we are used to referring in, what about religion, and I am wondering whether we can refer this to, this way of approaching the truth and viewing the world as we already know and  I am  trying to refer  to certain fixed ideas .  Religions has effects, have code of living, codes of how you behave, how to make love, what is a sin? what is not a sin? Now what is you approach to these things.
M: My approach is such that they all have failed completely. Nobody does that.  Its a fact we should face it.  Actually when it is within , when you become your own master, you yourself know ,like, I would say for eg: supposing I am holding a snake and its darkness, I cant see then, you tell me its a snake. I will not accept, no its not a snake , I am holding  a rope but if there is a little light I will immediately leave it.  You don't have to tell me anything.  In the same way when you are enlightened you see for yourself.  We have seen people overnight giving up drugs.  Once they get their realisation just I don't have to tell them.  They themselves do it because they have their own light and their own power.
J:What is a sin?failing persons for your way.
M:You see its our ego which tells us this is  a sin and this is not a sin.
J:Its our ego!
M:And also our conditioning . Both things are there.  See, they say this is a sin for a muslim, this is a sin for a Hindu-its  sin.  How can there be different types of sin.  Sin has to be universal.  After all its  a sin.  So when you get your realisation you realise that you are now above everything else and you just don't do anything wrong, you just don't do it. You don't like it, don't do it.
J: But you see we have created a world that we have constructed this wrong, I mean ,say , you are  a Muslim, you have a right in marrying two women or four women and in our system is not accepted, then how can you know whether it is correct or not.
M:That time you see when Mohammed was there. He was attacked and the tribes were attacked and all the young people died and there were very few men left and he didn't want prostitution.  So he thought  it is best  to let the men can marry the women who are without marriage ,so he believed in marriage and he said, they should marry.  Now young girls also,they couldn't get husbands he said still you should get married otherwise they would become prostitutes .  So to get rid of that thing he said alright its for what we call in sanskrit as samayachar according to the time they incarnated.          
For example at this time of mine my work is to give realistion thats all.  My job is to give realisation to people and so I have to do that.  So this is the time in the growth of the tree,first there is roots and there are shoots and gradually grows and it comes up gradually to a point when it becomes,say the flowers,so I call it the blossom time because so many flowers are becoming fruits.So the time has come .Its time has come ripen for the new age to come without that we cannot solve the problem of the world.
J:I think its a very pragmatic and human way of approaching the life and you are right but let me insist on that I have front of me a Holy Mother with the signs of the way ,say the men treat the women you have very obvious sign you were married.  Does this way of approaching ,does it effect the relationship between men and women? What is the opinion.
M:Marriage is very important. This year we had 86 international marriages.
J:What you mean international!OK mixed ok.
M:Marriage is very important .Different countries.You have one Greek lady is married to a French man.  So their children are realised souls,most of them are very surprising very beautiful children they get.  But one of these marriages we should say one or two percentage,there is problem still.  But otherwise successful marriages beautiful marriages and they enjoy it. Thats  a part of life one has to marry all these nonsense of not marrying and doing all these things I donít believe in it because its a natural thing whatever natural has to be there.
J:Do you think say the way that people get married in the jewish tradition is different ,than the way marriage in Methodist tradition now would you then accept all these methods that the people have or people used to or born in How people get married?
M:of What?
J:How people get married according to your life style?
M:In our life style what we are doing now,supposing  somebody want to marry somebody its alright, They come and tell me Mother I want to marry somebody its alright but we see the vibrations and things also there should not be too much disparity and all that but as we say alright but supposing they want that we should select for them, what we do one month they are together in a tour we have,we see their vibrations .  We see their attitudes ,we have forms to say what is your aptitude ,would you like to go to another country, what country you like  What is your hight ,ideas, what is your education and where have you been before for  seeking ,so we get the complete bio data of that person and then we suggest that such and such a person will be alright.  In one month they see the person they see that it suits if not they inform and they have another choice and whichever way they like but is not a random.  We little bit guide them because they should also know the background of the person what sort of a person is just you donít fall in love like that ,so again get into trouble. So are we it has worked out very well because it is such an understanding that they are marrying  a person whom they know very well and also they are marrying a person who has got angelic qualities, so they donít fail.
J:And when the actually realises after all this training for the hard time you give them for their and for the sake of their happiness that they suit each other,  How do theet married according to their own tradition or according to Hindu tradition.
M:No we have Sahaja Yoga style of marriage.
J:There is a mystery as we call it.
M:No there is no mystery in sahaja yoga.  We tak about all the centres ,take the name of all the centres , all the deities on the centres then by theses centres you have to be married  and that s how they have to promise that they will look after their life in a way that should be righteous and thats how they get married .  We have open system. There is no mystery in sahaja yoga ,No mystery.
J: You see its very tempting the way that you approach the world because it gives you no doubt because there is nothing in darkness now let us take another phenomenon which is very old but very very modern. Could I give love in people and matching each other there is two men who want to live together and we call them homosexuals, what is the way you approach?
M:I think its rather unnatural.  Also I have seen people who had this kind of problems ,they came to me and they were possessed.  A man was possessed by a woman so he wanted to have a man but once the possession went away he became very normal, Men are very easy they take to married life very easily.  Women I think they are homosexuals it takes sometime to get alright I don't know. May be emotionally they feel disturbed whatever it is! The men are absolutely alright.
J: How would you describe normal and natural?
M: Normal person is that a man wants to marry a woman is normal.  In India we cannot even conceive, I have never known this kind of problems.
J: Do you think it does not happen or we don't know about it?
M: May be in India they might be doing something .  But we have ever known anyone like that,  I was in the medical studies also, I never knew that.
J: I am sure you now go around the world......
M: After coming to the west then we discovered all this.
J: I mean it not only among the men also happening among the women as well.
M: I think there may be reasons, I know of a gentleman who is the homosexual because his wife was very nasty,she tortured him very much.
J: So You think there is always an explanation that something bad happening.
M:Yes,so he thought it is better to have a man, you see, no problems, no quarreling.  Thats how he became,but when he came to sahaja yoga He got completely cured,transformed.  He is got a nice wife,he is having children,he is very happy.  So I think it is abnormal conditions and problems that people take to this sometimes.  There are many reasons for that but it can be corrected if they want to.  If they don't want you cannot force it .  You cannot force self realisation on anyone.
J:But you can accept them as people who try to achieve purity.
M:When they come to Sahaja Yoga they change automatically.
J:Can they remain unchanged in these aspects.
M:so far we didn't have anyone like that.
J: I see. Now tell me about confessions.  It is something that we are familiar in Christianity.  There is some one like,automatically when you hear Holy Mother for instance there comes a hierarchy.  Now how is the hierarchy between the mortals in ......
M: We don't have anything like that, You see they come to Sahaja Yoga mostly the Christians catholics and all that and they send such letters describing what all wrong they have done and.. I never read it, Just burn it off.  Its not important.
J:You should return it to them.
M: No its no good. Its not important past is past finished now.forget it why its over.
J: How can they not repeat.  If they are not aware that this is wrong.  There is something that they should pay attention to.
M: Its  all a game of the ego and conditioning What happens you see the ego goes on telling that you did this wrong ,that wrong they feel guilty all the time.  There is no need to feel guilty or anything. It just works out ,see you are a human being and after all human beings can commit mistakes ,you are not gods,what is there to be so much angry with yourself for that just you should know that you can become the spirit which is the pure thing.  Like we say in the pond ,you see ,in the pond there can be worms and all sorts of things but when you become the lotus you are fragrant ,you are about it,nothing can spoil you,you get life,eternal life.
J:Thats right.  But who tells you whether you are right or wrong.
M:YOU yourself.
J: But..........
M:Because you feel it yourself that goodness within you.you feel it,Yourself.
J:You mean when you are right you feel it and even when you are wrong you feel it.
M:Wrong you will not feel normally,right and wrong are different concepts.  Its like that you feel when you get this ,you feel within yourself that you know the absolute,because you can use,supposing there is somebody suffering from cancer,now you put your hands towards that person ,what happened is the chakras are catching .  Immediately you know that the person has cancer.  He may not know! The doctors may not know,but you know.  Then you ask the question about yourself.  Is it alright ? You can ask because you are now with absolute.  So now there is no question of anybody telling you about it.  You just do it and know. Like people will come and tell me see Mother this agnya chakra is catching and this centre of Christ that means that person is suffering from ego. Normally.
J:Specially from ego. You don't.
M: Laughing No one say that . So what happens when you come and tell me that my agnya is catching means that you have ego , alright you can be corrected.,
J: It can be corrected.
M: Of course. 
J: Now we are dealing with teaching of consciousness and health. Now whats a miracle to you.
M: What is a? Miracle......
J:Does it mean anything or its just...
M:I don't think there is any miracle.
J: Its just one thing among others.  It is a way to absolute, its  a way your evolution..
M: First they say we were chimpanzees  Some chimpanzees became human beings ,other human beings ,all that human beings are no more.  Now we are there , there is a big gap between us and the chimps .  Like us who are realized souls and human beings there is a gap.  Now how many human beings will become the spiritual beings ? You can't say.  They should . According to John 144 thousand but we are more than that I think we crossed the limits.
J:According to John!!!!
M:John the disciple of Christ.
J: You quote the APOSTLE...  I see...
M: So this counting was wrong.  May be we have crossed that limit(Laughing) Whatever it is when you become the spiritual being then these people are left behind,how, you see how we are destroying ourselves otherwise.  This AIDS business.. You go to America  you are shocked people are so nervous they are schizophrenic, this disease ,that disease and all kinds of destructive things listening to this horrible music now they are deaf ,they loose their hair all kinds of things are happenings but always they take to something destructive.  Everything like a man sees somebody going in the pub and coming out and falling down.  Another one goes pays to fall down. He cant see that its destructive . But after a realisation you see what is destructive,and whats is constructive so a person realised starts moving much higher and the person who is not realised and there is at first like that and a big gap.  I find there is but in one months time he can change.
J: In one months time.
M: He becomes an expert. 
J: Thats a very quick progress.  Now tell me in all religion there is different stages , grades as you go up.  Is there any education for small children? How do we introduce them to this Yoga - the young children.
M:The young children are born realised ,they immediately know ME.
J:So they can do that at what age?
M:You see even little babies.
J: Really.
M: They see ME they start smiling and just talking very sweet.
J: Alright
M: On the whole the children are very good for realisation  because they are pure souls , they are still innocent.  They are best normally of course we are getting very much worried about children, because they are getting spoilt and this and that ,but when they come to sahaj ayoga, they become excellent children. Now we have a school also in India in the Himalayas ,we have a beautiful school for children and everybody says that they are so much wise ,beautiful,sensible.respectful.  It is really worth seeing the way they behave and so on.  You see their spirit starts manifesting.
J:Now would you describe certain practices of prayers or anything else that is a must for your disciple.
M: There is no prescribed things as such but according to your centres.  Now if someone centre is in jeopardy or there is any problem with any centre then you should know how to cure it and correct it and then there are few things you have to do by which you can correct it. Its very simple.
J: It is .  I am sure there is a plenty of time for you to meet the people around the world as you travel non stop. Now tell me about ....
M: But at the most two three four days ,I am at home and then I travel.
J: You travel.
M: In India I have been there for two months with my family.  They also come down sometimes here.
J: Now how all this started ? How you are something unapproachable.  I mean what is the inspiration to do all this? Are you consider yourself as the founder ,way you are approaching the truth?
M:Actually Sahaja Yoga is an ancient system.As I told you it was only for one person they used to use.  But if you see founder of the system amass movement ,Yes I am.  But its all there already it was already there these things were there , but only thing is worked out the permutation and combination in human beings ,why is it that they cannot get amass realisation and discovery whatever it is if it cannot be used by masses its useless. And I worked it out and I....
J: Its the system to approach the people.  Now how do you,can you tell us about your life now? Now you are someone who preaches the message around the world.  How is it accepted?
M: Very much.Because this is a special time, modern times its called Kaliyuga in India.  Its the worst times.  You see all kinds of sins will be done all kinds of things.  They describe horrible things but at the same time there will be a category of people who are seekers. And so many of them .  Its already prophesied by William Blake in England .  He has written about it there will be men of God be born in those days and they will have the capacity to become divine and to make others.  He has clearly described.
J: So in this part of the world it is only reached ,You have reached other means,  Do you have relationship and do you meet people like leading figures of other religions.
M: Rather difficult(laughs)
J:Why?
M: Because you see they have set ideas and most of the religions are either power oriented or money oriented they are not spirit oriented.
J:Well that is very serious.
M: Its a big problem you know, if they were spirit oriented,I would have to meet them and talk to them ,but they are not . You see its a big problem.
J: And would you say you consider the people who follow you live with you as a church.
M: I was born in a Christian family myself.
J: I see well do you think it is as easy for a Christian or anybody else to reach out and find this way.
M: Christians abroad are alright because they started thinking that they should have more than the church. The church is not sufficient like now they are closing down all the churches.  There has to be something to be found out.  But in Christianity is some places like India are no  like that they are not seeking.They think that the Christians abroad are saintly people. That some of them believe that Christ was born in England!Can You believe it?
J: (laughs)Well I am sure that appears in a british Gentleman.  The system we have made out of HIM he is not Palestine at all and you realise there is a twist anyway....
M: It is ignorance. Complete ignorance about even Christ.  It is there .  But after Sahaja Yoga you realise who he was .what was his greatness .  Really you know what important work he has done without him I could not have managed.  All of them are very necessary and he is the last gate,we have to open and thats what he has done.  But how contradictory we are ? Like we say he suffered for our sins,still why should we suffer now anymore.  Its very contradictory that we should suffer for Christ.Why? No father would like you to suffer.Why will he like you to suffer? So this sufferings and all this is not necessary.
J: Can you tell us how the group of people who live the way you explained to us in Greece what do they do? How do they live among them I would like to know.
M:Oh they are very dynamic.  Yes, dynamic people.  They are doing very well in life,most of them very much improved in health and in every way their married life has improved of course or two cases ,some of them are orthodox people who try to trouble them Most of them are very happy and doing very well.
J: Seem to think that a healthy if not wealthy group do you address as poor people or miserable people ,people who are desperate as well 
M: Oh the good people are the middle class people are better.  The poor people they don't  have money just now and they want eat and then they don't think of the spirit so much .  Once the spiritual life the middle group they have them they go to the poor because there is free health services also then the vibrations give tremendous amount of more food the crops improve.  The cattle improve so thats how you help your farming thats how it works out.  But rich are not difficult they say we are alright they have everything , But money has problems and they also come.  Even politicians come but I must say that they are rather slow bureaucrats politicians.
J: They are slow they think world is not spinning enough. Now how do you deal with young people who has loud music ,speed.......
M: You see this is the Meta Modern, talking about Modern era where people will not have any violence because its compassion and love.  You feel the love for another person.  There is no question of violence .  In this meta modern era.  There will not be racialism no fanaticism. Fundamentalism all issue will drop out because isms are conditioning and ignorance.
J:Isms are schisms.

M: Isms they are ism.  Sahaja Yoga there is no isms.  It is being in reality.  So you don't have this problem.  After this you have people from all over the world and I never see them quarreling fighting  of course pull each other leg. They are very humorous and they enjoy life ,just enjoy. We are not bothered to what their jobs are but they are telling me so many results out of the is here only they told me some of them Photographers got 1st prize for the photography.  Some musicians got very high salaries and things like that ,so it knows that you are one in balance and peace you can achieve much more than when you are disturbed.
J: So you come in a category which has the idea of homogenous total population that all belongs to one ethnic group,race,one religion.  This is very useful for us in this country to realise that its not so 
There are people who think different to approach the truth the same life in a different way,  Now what will be the message for the people who will be meeting you tomorrow apart from all that you told us today.
M: Here for the people here... Actually they have  to know the heritage .  This is their heritage.  I am talking about you see, they cannot learn anything from this western people,  You have to teach them your heritage is here because you are very traditionally bound people. But somehow its lost.  I don't know why if you can comeback  to it the whole world can learn from you.  It is so important .  It is a great discovery.  Once you discover what you are how purified how great you are and the whole self esteem comes with you,  You become very eminent,dignified and a beautiful person.
J: You see we have been listening to the wise voice that reminds us of our part own tradition of the country of the other country and reminds us how different we can be in seeking the one and only truth in very many different ways.  Good Night, Thank You,
M: Thank You very much.
The tape ends here.
