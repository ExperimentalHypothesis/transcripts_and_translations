Interview on a Greek TV. 27 April 1993.
Journalist: Good evening, its very strong a feeling that so many time although we are in our own country, tonight we have the opportunity of really make a long travel. A long travel in wisdom, in distance, in space, in our hearts, in truth. This is all the elements that are concentrated in the presence of our Holy Mother that we have invited here, and we are grateful, that we have you, all the way from one of the oldest civilizations. In a way we are very proud that we are the members of very old civilization and rarely we realise how other civilizations shine in other places around the world. So we do welcome you here along with the truth you carry for us. We would like to ask you about this truth in the way you see in the same world, this other countries that is every country, which is in our heart.
1:15
Shri Mataji : We have to know one thing, what the truth is? The truth is actually we are not this body, mind, intellect, emotions (emotionnals), ego, but we are the Spirit and in our evolutionary process we have reached the stage of human awareness and beyond this there is a little break through by which we have to become the Spirit. That is very simple and can be done very easily for people who are seeking the truth.
Journalist : How would you describe the system of your thought, the system that you have brought to our hearts and mind?
Shri Mataji : You will be amazed to know that in Greece people called a bone sacrum, which is the triangular bone and that means they knew there was something sacred about the bone. Now this bone has got within itself a residual power which is for our connection to the all pervading divine power. All the scriptures has talked about the all pervading divine love and everything, but we have never felt it before. It is a surprising thing that we take all living things for granted, for our heart beats, but we do not know how it beats? The flower grows, we don’t know how it grows? But if you understand that there is some power which is doing all this living work, then the time has come for us to know it, to feel it, to understand it, and also to use it.
Journalist : How do you think that people have arrived, in so many conclusion that they call religion and what is the connection between this way of approaching ourselves and the truth which is one, and your old tradition in your country which I assume is India?
Shri Mataji : Now in all religions it is written that you have to transform, you have to be born again. Every religion has said that. This is not only that any particular religion has said it. Even Islam has said that you have to become a Wali. Even Christianity has said that you have to be born again. I mean there is no religion which has not said that, but it is not just a certificate. You cannot take just a certificate that “I am born again”. It is something that actualizes, by which you develop a new state, a new state of your mind, state of your being by which you become the Spirit and there are powers of the Spirit which you manifest. It is not just talking and giving sermons and lectures, but it is something that is an actualization and it is a living process.

Journalist : I think we Greeks belongs to the world what they call the east part of philosophy of religion. This is a system which is mostly esoteric, this is a Greek word. It is a seeking inside and it is quite relevant and close to the very ancient Indian tradition.
Shri Mataji :  Of course, of course.
Journalist : Now how close is the Indian old religious system are ! I am talking about the Pagan. Our own ancestors before the Christianity and even the Jewish or all the Hindu goddess to the best you know ?
Shri Mataji : This is specially in Greece you had the ancient system of worshipping the Goddess Athena. Now in Sanskrit ATHA means the primordial, to us is the Primordial Mother, that we call in our language as Adi Shakti, the Primordial Mother. She has, you must have seen a snake in the shield and also in her hand, that is the symbol of this power within you, which lies dormant in your triangular bone called as sacrum. So the Greeks knew about it, no doubt, because otherwise they would not have called her Athena and she must have been in our scriptures, she is described as well, not only that, but Greece is called as Manipur dvipa, that is the navel of the universe.
Journalist : Certainly it was a surprise for me to see that you come here to preach our own ancient Gods. 
Shri Mataji : Yes, it’s true. 
Journalist : What you are telling us about Athena, is that the serpents with Greek gods are very familiar creatures -
Shri Mataji : Yes, but it is suggesting -
Journalist : and the medicine and others. Now what is the message of Athena coming from you again nowadays ?
Shri Mataji : [gentle laugh] Athena is the one that - she is the one who was trying to push her spear into the fontanel bone of Zeus, you see. Now that is exactly what Sahaja Yoga is. We think, or not : we believe, and that we have proved also, that this power which we call as Kundalini, because it is like a serpent going into coils, 
Journalist : Yes
Shri Mataji : Because it’s an energy which moves like a serpent, you see, more symbolic, it is not the serpent actually. So this is the power which is the reflection of Athena within us and when she rises she goes and hits here and opens out the fontanel bone and that is the actualization of baptism, as described in Christianity. By that, then you are connected with the subtle energy which is the All pervading. For the first time you start feeling that cool breeze in your hands which is described, it’s the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is the same as Athena, but I think Christians could not connect it with that. She is the same.
Journalist : We see that all these sanctities along history come and repeat themselves and transfigurate themselves into traditions of people. 
Shri Mataji : Of course. 
Journalist : Now you have referred to Yoga and of course in this part of the world we are more or less familiar. Now for those who are less, I would like you to found what we are talking now in this yoga, and give us some ideas about the wide spectrum of the work, you would call Yoga.
Shri Mataji : You see, Yoga is where you unite, is the union between your Self with the divine, is Yoga.  That’s the real spiritual yoga. All other yogas, like physical yoga and all that, is a wee part of what one Patanjali wrote. I’s a very wee part that to cleanse your body and all that, is there. But, there is no need now to do all that. First in the modern times, what if I’ve done any work is this, that people used to get self Realization, alright, but one Master had only one disciple. Gradually it started in a way that they started talking about it. From I think,12th century it became more open. But it has been there years together. Now when they started talking about it, they could not give amass Realization. They could give only to one person. So only thing I have done is to workout the permutations and combinations of human nature by which I have understood that how to give amass Realization. That is the only achievement of modern Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is an ancient system in India. Also must have been here because the way the sacrum bone is there, and she is having all those things. But the practice of that may not have been so open, might have been secret even those days, where they have been giving Realization to people, and it is ancient times, thousands of years back so. But in India we have still maintained all those traditions and things and still we respect and worship the Mother Goddess Athena we respect. She’s called as Adi Shakti, name is different, and she is the Holy Ghost according to us. 
Now this work-out is in everyone, it’s your own power within you and it works out and it rises and pierces through your fontanel bone area. It does. It  actualizes the experience which is described and that’s what one has to feel, otherwise it is just talk talk, talk, talk. 





Any religion has become nothing but talk, you see, people are now fed up. They think what is this promising, claiming and nothing happens to us, we are just the same. 
Journalist : Hum, hum
Shri Mataji : Our forefathers were such and we are just the same. But now the time has come, it’s a new age as I say to achieve that state, a new state, where you become. Firstly you become thoughtlessly aware, means you live in the present. Thoughts come to you from the past and from the future you’re dancing on the cusp of thoughts. But when this happens the thoughts are separated and in between the thoughts, there is a space which we call as the present, which is reality. Present is the reality because the past is finished and the future does not exist so you live in the present. When you live in the present, you start growing spirituality. And that’s what happens to you, first that you become thoughllessly aware. The second thing happens to you that you start feeling the cool breeze on your hands. Medically you know that these endings (Mother shows the finger tips) of the sympathetic nervous system. 
Journalist : Hum, hum
10:55
Shri Mataji : So what happens that when you get your Realization, you start feeling this cool breeze all along and you start feeling those things on your finger tips. Now supposing if you have a problem in any one of these centres - there are seven centres [Mother demonstrates in her hand] five, six and seven. Immediately you feel it on your finger tips. You don’t have to go to a doctor to diagnosis, immediately you know. 
11:14
Now if you know how to cure, then physically you can be cured, mentally you can be cured also all our human problems or I should say all the world’s problems are because of human beings. All our human problems are because of centres which are within us. So when this power rises, She nourishes them, She integrates them and corrects them so we get physical, mental, emotional problems solved and there you achieve your own peace within yourself, but the second thing which you achieve is a new awareness which is a collective consciousness. That’s where you can feel not only your own centres but also the centre of others. Now when you grow spiritually by sitting down here you can feel the centres of any one, sitting down here you can correct the centres of the other people, but you have to grow. But in the beginning you start feeling the Joy of your being because in your heart resides the Spirit. Spirit is the source of joy. It is the source of absolute truth. So you know of the absolute truth. You can feel on your finger and ask any question say, They might say was Christ the son of God? Alright ask the question , immediately you start getting tremendous vibrations . Surprisingly Athena is also called Pallas, Pallas means vibrations, you see she give vibration. These vibration tells you the absolute truth . We live in relative world that’s why we are fighting , once we are in absolute truth, there is no fight ,no problems. When this happens you become collectively conscious and who is the other? Everybody is within your body. You can feel everyone within yourself so you become a universal personality. This is the character of your spirit, because the spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within you, which is in everyone. But it is just a witness till you are a realised soul but once you become a realised soul then its start manifesting . It manifests and you can also raise the kundalini of others . You can give realisation to others. It is like if you enlighten one candle that candle enlighten other candle. So thats how it spreads
Journalist : This is very interesting. While you are talking I am writing down certain things that coming in contrast with what we are used to the so called the western world. I am wondering this split between body and mind that we suffer. That is something you do not suffer. Its wonderful how people in the far east and of course then spirit is not schizophrenic. How do you explain? How can people come back together with either mind and body, because now in this part of the world ,people who live for the bodies or those who live for their minds?
Shri Mataji : They are ignorant. That is why they are in darkness you see. They think the body is very important but I know of people who have very good body is also coming to me, saying Mother please, give us peace, you see give us joy. So nobody is satisfied.
Journalist : (interferes) That is the other part which is missing.
Shri Mataji : The whole thing is integrated in your body ,mind, your lives, ego everything and the ego just disappears. You become egoless. You don’t think you are doing anything. You think it is happening, it just happens.
Journalist: There is another idea that this sort of deep research brings you to the state of absolute and may be in absolute monastic idea, if you are by yourself or the whole world is yourself. Now listening to you I get the impression that is exactly the opposite, That you communicate with everybody and that s more of a communal approach than being lonely. It is a miracle now by coming into yourself you reach out everybody else. Now I think that you would agree with me ,it is wrong to think of orient is something mystic as something which cut off with the world.
Shri Mataji : No, no it is universal. We are working in 56 nations with Sahaja Yoga . Specially in Russia surprisingly we have thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis.
Journalist:Very recently.
Shri Mataji : Ya very recently about three years. Within three years we have got thousands and thousands of them, you see. I think in the democratic countries we have too much time to waste. You see in enjoying all kinds of problems for nothing at all. While they are , they have given up all these nonsenses. They thought whatever is available is available ,like ,so there is no solution, So give it up and thats how they are very introspective I think. Russia also the Eastern Block people coming in thousands ,who got realisation also. Of course India they know it. We have thousands . I must admit that but so many countries like Austria,Italy specially is now so fed up with all this is going on in Italy, that they have taken to Sahaja Yoga. Very strongly and all kinds of people are coming. So it is something that has to happen and has been predicted. It is been promised.
J: Now tell me we were referring to countries with very strong tradition in religion ,say Italy is very strong Catholic country , Russia has orthodox past. How about the very different systems like Africa ,like South America? You know this is the new world and there is a sharp difference in the approach of thinking in the new world. How is your message delivered here?
Shri Mataji : You see actually all these incarnations whether it was Christ,Rama, Krishna, Mohammed, any one of them…
Journalist: you call all of them incarnations!
Shri Mataji : All of them were incarnations. See they were born on the same tree of life of spirituality. All of them like beautiful flowers at different time but people plucked the flowers and now they are fighting with the dead flowers. So you see that there is though the religion is within its just outside. Christian-you go to, Mosque-you go to,Temple- you go to you can do anything. 

18:09
I mean, there is nothing inside the religion, but with this inside religion is awakened and you become righteous, really become an angel, I tell you.
Journalist: So tell me, you become an Angel, but still you live in the world, 
Shri Mataji : Live in this world
Journalist: and you know, there is something that we are used to referring in, what about religion, and I am wondering whether we can refer to this way of approaching the truth and viewing the world as we already know and I am trying to refer to certain fixed ideas. Religions has effects, have code of living, codes of how you behave, how you make love, what is a sin? what is not a sin? Now what is you approach to these things.
Shri Mataji : My approach is such that, they all have failed completely, nobody does that. You see it’s a fact we should face it. Actually when it is within you then you become your own master, you yourself know. Like, I would say an example: supposing I am holding a snake and its darkness, I can’t see. Now, you tell me it’s a snake. I will not accept, no it’s not a snake, I am holding a rope but if there is a little light I will immediately leave it. You don’t have to tell me anything. In the same way when you are enlightened you see for yourself. We have seen people overnight giving up drugs, overnight giving. Once they get their Realization just I don’t have to tell them. They themselves do it because they have their own light and their own power.
19:40
Journalist: What is a sin or a failing person, for your way?
Shri Mataji : You see it’s our ego which tells us this is a sin and this is not a sin.
Journalist: It’s our ego.
Shri Mataji : And also conditionings. You see both things are there, that they say this is a sin. For a Muslim, this is a sin, for a Hindu, this is sin. How can there be different types of sin? Sin could be, has to be universal, isn’t it? After all if it is a sin. So when you get your Realization, you realize that you are now above everything else and you just don’t do anything wrong, just you don’t do it. You don’t like it, just don’t do it.
Journalist: But you see we have created a world that we have constructed this wrong, I mean ,say , you are a Muslim, you have a right in marrying two women or four women and in our system is not accepted, now how can you know whether it is correct or not?
Shri Mataji : Now see at that time you see when Mohammed was there, you see he was attacked : it was a tribe and tribes were attacked all the time. And all the young people died and I mean there were very few men left and he didn’t want prostitution. So he thought the best is, now let men can marry women who are without marriage, so he believed in marriage and he said : “you should marry”. Now there were some young girls also, they couldn’t get husbands he said : “still you should marry”, otherwise they would have become prostitutes. So to get rid of that thing, he said alright. It is what we call in sanskrit “samayachar” according to the time, the incarnations act.
For example at this time of mine, my work is to give Realization, that’s all. My only job is to give Realization to people. So I’ve to do that. So this is the time every- like in the growth of the tree, you see, first there are roots and then there are shoots, and then gradually it grows and it comes to a point when it becomes, say the flowers, so I call it the blossom time because so many flowers are becoming fruits. So the time has come. It’s a time which is ripen for this new age to come in and without that we cannot solve the problem of the world.
22:00

J:I think its a very pragmatic and human way of approaching the life and you are right but let me insist on that I have front of me a Holy Mother with the signs of the way ,say the men treat the women you have very obvious sign you were married. Does this way of approaching ,does it effect the relationship between men and women? What is the opinion.
M:Marriage is very important. This year we had 86 international marriages.
J:What you mean international!OK mixed ok.
M:Marriage is very important .Different countries.You have one Greek lady is married to a French man. So their children are realised souls,most of them are very surprising very beautiful children they get. But one of these marriages we should say one or two percentage,there is problem still. But otherwise successful marriages beautiful marriages and they enjoy it. Thats a part of life one has to marry all these nonsense of not marrying and doing all these things I donít believe in it because its a natural thing whatever natural has to be there.
J:Do you think say the way that people get married in the jewish tradition is different ,than the way marriage in Methodist tradition now would you then accept all these methods that the people have or people used to or born in How people get married?
Shri Mataji: of What?
J:How people get married according to your life style?
Shri Mataji: In our life style what we are doing now,supposing somebody want to marry somebody its alright, They come and tell me Mother I want to marry somebody its alright but we see the vibrations and things also there should not be too much disparity and all that but as we say alright but supposing they want that we should select for them, what we do one month they are together in a tour we have,we see their vibrations . We see their attitudes ,we have forms to say what is your aptitude ,would you like to go to another country, what country you like What is your hight ,ideas, what is your education and where have you been before for seeking ,so we get the complete bio data of that person and then we suggest that such and such a person will be alright. In one month they see the person they see that it suits if not they inform and they have another choice and whichever way they like but is not a random. We little bit guide them because they should also know the background of the person what sort of a person is just you don’t fall in love like that, so again get into trouble. So are we it has worked out very well because it is such an understanding that they are marrying a person whom they know very well and also they are marrying a person who has got angelic qualities, so they don’t fail.
J:And when the actually realizes after all this training for the hard time you give them for their and for the sake of their happiness that they suit each other, How do theet married according to their own tradition or according to Hindu tradition.
Shri Mataji: No we have Sahaja Yoga style of marriage.
J:There is a mystery as we call it.
Shri Mataji: No there is no mystery in sahaja yoga. We talk about all the centres ,take the name of all the centres, all the deities on the centres then by theses centres you have to be married and that s how they have to promise that they will look after their life in a way that should be righteous and that’s how they get married . We have open system. There is no mystery in sahaja yoga, No mystery.

Journalist: You see its very tempting the way that you approach the world because it gives you no doubt because there is nothing in darkness now let us take another phenomenon which is very old but very very modern. Could I give love in people and matching each other there is two men who want to live together and we call them homosexuals, what is the way you approach?
Shri Mataji : I think its rather unnatural. Also I have seen people who had this kind of problems, they came to me and they were possessed. A man was possessed by a woman so he wanted to have a man but once the possession went away he became very normal, Men are very easy they take to married life very easily. Women I think they are homosexuals it takes sometime to get alright I don’t know. May be emotionally they feel disturbed whatever it is! The men are absolutely alright.
Journalist : How would you describe normal and natural?
Shri Mataji : Normal person is that a man wants to marry a woman is normal. In India we cannot even conceive, I have never known this kind of problems.
Journalist: Do you think it does not happen or we don’t know about it?
Shri Mataji: May be in India they might be doing something. But we have ever known anyone like that, I was in the medical studies also, I never knew that.
Journalist: I am sure you now go around the world……
Shri Mataji: After coming to the west then we discovered all this.
Journalist: I mean it not only among the men also happening among the women as well.
Shri Mataji: Ah yes. But I think, you see, may be some reasons, I know of a gentleman who is the homosexual because his wife was very nasty, she tortured him very much.
Journalist: So You think there is always an explanation that something bad happening.
Shri Mataji: Yes, so he thought it is better to have a man, you see, no problems, no quarreling. Thats how he became, but when he came to Sahaja Yoga He got completely cured, transformed. He is got a nice wife, he is having children, he is very happy. So I think it is abnormal conditions and problems that people take to this, sometimes. There are many reasons for that but it can be corrected if they want to. If they don’t want, you cannot force it. You cannot force self Realization on anyone.
Journalist: But you can accept them as people who try to achieve purity.
Shri Mataji: Yes if they want to, but  when they come to Sahaja Yoga they change automatically.
Journalist: Can they remain unchanged in these aspects?
Shri Mataji: so far we didn’t have anyone like that.
Journalist: I see. 
28:36


Journalist: Now tell me about confessions. It is something that we are familiar in Christianity. There is some one like, automatically when you hear Holy Mother for instance there comes a hierarchy. Now how is the hierarchy between the mortals in ……
Shri Mataji: We don’t have anything like that, You see they come to Sahaja Yoga mostly the Christians Catholics and all that and they send such letters describing what all wrong they have done and. I never read it, Just burn it off. It’s not important.
Journalist: You should return it to them.
Shri Mataji: No it’s no good. It’s not important, past is past, finished now, forget it why its over.
Journalist: How can they not repeat. If they are not aware that this is wrong. There is something that they should pay attention to.
Shri Mataji: It’s all a game of the ego and conditioning What happens you see the ego goes on telling that you did this wrong, that wrong, they feel guilty all the time. There is no need to feel guilty or anything. It just works out, see you are a human being and after all human beings can commit mistakes, you are not gods, what is there to be so much angry with yourself for that just you should know that you can become the spirit which is the pure thing. Like we say in the pond, you see ,in the pond there can be worms and all sorts of things but when you become the lotus you are fragrant ,you are about it, nothing can spoil you, you get life, eternal life.
Journalist: That’s right. But who tells you whether you are right or wrong.
Shri Mataji: You, yourself.
Journalist: But……….
Shri Mataji: Because you feel it yourself that goodness within you, you feel it yourself.
Journalist: You mean when you are right you feel it and even when you are wrong you feel it.
Shri Mataji: Wrong you will not feel normally, right and wrong are different concepts. It’s like that you feel when you get this, you feel within yourself that you know the absolute, because you can use, supposing there is somebody suffering from cancer, now you put your hands towards that person,what happened is the chakras are catching. Immediately you know that the person has cancer. He may not know! The doctors may not know, but you know. Then you ask the question about yourself. Is it alright ? You can ask because you are now with absolute. So now there is no question of anybody telling you about it. You just do it and know. Like people will come and tell me see Mother this agnya chakra is catching and this centre of Christ that means that person is suffering from ego. Normally.
Journalist: Specially from ego. You don’t.
Shri Mataji: (Laughing) No one say that. So what happens when you come and tell me that my agnya is catching means that you have ego, alright you can be corrected.
J: It can be corrected.
Shri Mataji: Of course.
J: Now we are dealing with teaching of consciousness and health. Now what is a miracle to you.
Shri Mataji: What is a? Miracle……
J: Does it mean anything or its just…
Shri Mataji: I don’t think there is any miracle.
J: Its just one thing among others. It is a way to absolute, its a way your evolution..
Shri Mataji: First they say we were chimpanzees Some chimpanzees became human beings ,other human beings ,all that human beings are no more. Now we are there , there is a big gap between us and the chimps . Like us who are realized souls and human beings there is a gap. Now how many human beings will become the spiritual beings ? You can’t say. They should . According to John 144 thousand but we are more than that I think we crossed the limits.
J: According to John!!!!
Shri Mataji: John the disciple of Christ.
J: You quote the APOSTLE… I see…
Shri Mataji: So this counting was wrong. May be we have crossed that limit (Laughing) Whatever it is when you become the spiritual being then these people are left behind, how, you see how we are destroying ourselves otherwise. This AIDS business.. You go to America you are shocked people are so nervous they are schizophrenic, this disease ,that disease and all kinds of destructive things listening to this horrible music now they are deaf ,they loose their hair all kinds of things are happenings but always they take to something destructive. Everything like a man sees somebody going in the pub and coming out and falling down. Another one goes pays to fall down. He cant see that its destructive . But after a realisation you see what is destructive,and whats is constructive so a person realised starts moving much higher and the person who is not realised and there is at first like that and a big gap. I find there is but in one months time he can change.
J: In one months time.
Shri Mataji: He becomes an expert.
J: Thats a very quick progress. 


33:53
Journalist: Now tell me in all religion there are different stages, grades, as you grow up. Is there any education for small children? How are they introduced to this system of Yoga?
Shri Mataji: Who?
Journalist: The young children.
Shri Mataji: See, young children, if they are born realized, they immediately know me. I don’t have to-
Journalist: So they can do that at what age?
Shri Mataji: You see, even little babies -
Journalist: Really?
Shri Mataji: They see me they start smiling and just talking to me, it’s very sweet.
Journalist: Alright
Shri Mataji: On the whole, children are very good for Realization because they are pure souls, they are innocent. They are the best. I mean, normally, you see, nowadays of course, we are getting very much worried about children, because they are getting spoiled and this and that, but when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they become excellent children. Now we have a school also in India now, on the Himalayas, we have a beautiful school for children and everybody says that they are so matured, so wise, so sensible, so respectful, it’s really worth seeing them, the way they behave and talk. Because, you see, their spirit starts manifesting.
Journalist: Hum, hum.
Now would you describe certain practice of prayers or anything else that is a must for some of your disciples?
Shri Mataji: No there is, there is no prescribed things as such, but according to your centres. Now if someone centre is in jeopardy or there’s a problem with any centre, then you should know how to cure it and correct it. And there are few things you have to do, by which you can correct it. It’s very simple.
Journalist: It is. 
Shri Mataji: Yes, extremely.
Journalist: Well, I’m sure there is a plenty of time for you to meet the people around the world as you travel non stop. Now tell me -
Shri Mataji: [Laughing] You can’t say. But at the most, two three four days, I am at home and then I travel.
Journalist: You travel.
Shri Mataji: Yes, but India, I’m there for about two months, with my family. They also come down here sometimes.
Journalist: Now how did this all started ? Now you are something of a –
Shri Mataji: Seventy.
Journalist: an approchal. What is the inspiration for you to do all this? Do you consider yourself as the founder of this way of approaching the truth?
Shri Mataji: That’s what they say but you see, actually Sahaja Yoga is an ancient system. As I told you, it was only for one person they used to use. But as what you say, if I’m the founder of this amass movement, I am. But it is all there already. It was there, all these things were there. Only thing, if I’ve worked anything, it’s the permutations and the combinations as I said about human beings, why is it that they cannot get amass Realization. Any discovery, whatever it is, if it cannot be used by masses, is useless. And I worked it out and it’s done, that’s all.
Journalist: It is the system that approaches people. Now how do you- tell us about your life now. You are really someone who preaches a new message around the world. How is it accepted?
Shri Mataji: Very much. Because this is a time, special time, modern times, called as Kaliyuga in India. It’s the worst times, you see. And all kinds of sins will be done, all kinds of things, they describe horrible things for this. But at the same time, there will be a category of people who are seekers of truth, and so many of them. It’s already prophesied. William Blake in England, you see, he has written about it, that there will be men of God, who’ll be born in those days, and they will have the capacity to become divine and make others [divine]. This is clearly described.
Journalist: So him, in another part of the world, with his own education, reached with his means what you reach in other ways. 
Shri Mataji: Yes.
37:51


Journalist: Do you have relationship and do you meet people like leading figures of other religions.
Shri Mataji: Rather difficult (laughs)
J:Why?
Shri Mataji: Because you see they have set ideas and most of the religions are either power oriented or money oriented they are not spirit oriented.
J:Well that is very serious.
Shri Mataji: It’s a big problem you know, if they were spirit oriented, I would have to meet them and talk to them ,but they are not . You see its a big problem.
J: And would you say you consider the people who follow you live with you as a church.
Shri Mataji: I was born in a Christian family myself.
J: I see well do you think it is as easy for a Christian or anybody else to reach out and find this way.
Shri Mataji: Christians abroad are alright because they started thinking that they should have more than the church. The church is not sufficient like now they are closing down all the churches. There has to be something to be found out. But in Christianity is some places like India are no like that they are not seeking. They think that the Christians abroad are saintly people. That some of them believe that Christ was born in England! Can You believe it?
J: (laughs) Well I am sure that appears in a british Gentleman. The system we have made out of HIM he is not Palestine at all and you realise there is a twist anyway….
Shri Mataji: It is ignorance. Complete ignorance about even Christ. It is there . But after Sahaja Yoga you realise who he was .what was his greatness . Really you know what important work he has done without him I could not have managed. All of them are very necessary and he is the last gate,we have to open and thats what he has done. But how contradictory we are ? Like we say he suffered for our sins,still why should we suffer now anymore. Its very contradictory that we should suffer for Christ.Why? No father would like you to suffer.Why will he like you to suffer? So this sufferings and all this is not necessary.
J: Can you tell us how the group of people who live the way you explained to us in Greece what do they do? How do they live among them I would like to know.
Shri Mataji: Oh they are very dynamic. Yes, dynamic people. They are doing very well in life, most of them very much improved in health and in every way their married life has improved of course or two cases, some of them are orthodox people who try to trouble them Most of them are very happy and doing very well.
J: Seem to think that a healthy if not wealthy group do you address as poor people or miserable people, people who are desperate as well
Shri Mataji: Oh the good people are the middle class people are better. The poor people they don’t have money just now and they want eat and then they don’t think of the spirit so much . Once the spiritual life the middle group they have them they go to the poor because there is free health services also then the vibrations give tremendous amount of more food the crops improve. The cattle improve so thats how you help your farming thats how it works out. But rich are not difficult they say we are alright they have everything , But money has problems and they also come. Even politicians come but I must say that they are rather slow bureaucrats politicians.
J: They are slow they think world is not spinning enough. Now how do you deal with young people who has loud music ,speed…….
Shri Mataji: You see this is the Meta Modern, talking about Modern era where people will not have any violence because its compassion and love. You feel the love for another person. There is no question of violence . In this meta modern era. There will not be racialism no fanaticism. Fundamentalism all issue will drop out because isms are conditioning and ignorance.
J:Isms are schisms.
Shri Mataji: Isms they are ism. Sahaja Yoga there is no isms. It is being in reality. So you don’t have this problem. After this you have people from all over the world and I never see them quarreling fighting of course pull each other leg. They are very humorous and they enjoy life ,just enjoy. We are not bothered to what their jobs are but they are telling me so many results out of the is here only they told me some of them Photographers got 1st prize for the photography. Some musicians got very high salaries and things like that ,so it knows that you are one in balance and peace you can achieve much more than when you are disturbed.
J: So you come in a category which has the idea of homogenous total population that all belongs to one ethnic group, race, one religion. This is very useful for us in this country to realise that its not so
There are people who think different to approach the truth the same life in a different way, Now what will be the message for the people who will be meeting you tomorrow apart from all that you told us today.
Shri Mataji: Here for the people here… Actually they have to know the heritage . This is their heritage. I am talking about you see, they cannot learn anything from this western people, You have to teach them your heritage is here because you are very traditionally bound people. But somehow its lost. I don’t know why if you can comeback to it the whole world can learn from you. It is so important . It is a great discovery. Once you discover what you are how purified how great you are and the whole self esteem comes with you, You become very eminent, dignified and a beautiful person.
J: You see we have been listening to the wise voice that reminds us of our part own tradition of the country of the other country and reminds us how different we can be in seeking the one and only truth in very many different ways. Good Night, Thank You,
Shri Mataji: Thank You very much.
