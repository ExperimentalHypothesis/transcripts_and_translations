The other argument that I gave in my book is about a doctor who thought that the second birth is possible only through sex and I told him that: “you were born because of your parent and not by your own activity. To say that, when you love fully you must have sex that means you love someone for sex and that without it your love is not expressed. The absolute value of love is thus challenged. Also, how can you have sex with all the people all the time? It is not possible. Then how can you love the people “fully” all the time?,,,it so foolish and absurd that I cannot argue on such empty grounds.
