They would be The custom of pilgrimage is going to Ganapatipule to worship Shri deeply buried in all religions, but it has Adi Shakti in December, so they decided now reduced to spiritual tourism. to cleanse themselves for the most Because firstly, the holy sites have either auspicious occasion.

Blind faith may provide Mataji's tapes and public programmes. them with some solace or satisfaction of Liverish Yogis who did not have the having performed an act of faith ordained by the scriptures. For example in North India the kshtris, for the first hair shave possibility of ice at home hired fridges for ice packs. How deeply they worshipped the goddess at Ganapatipule and how much love they enjoyed in the collectivity of a child, undertake pilgrimage to the temples of the goddess Chindpurmi, Naina a totally fulfilled them. They did not waste Devi, Chamunda Devi. Jawalamukhi, their precious time cleansing. and their Kundalini was not burdened with the task Kangra temple and Vaishno Devi. These places were blessed with different parts from the body of Goddess Sati after her dismemberment. A Sahaja Yogi would enjoy the vibrations of the sacred sites but for non-realized seekers such of clearing the left and right sides. So the Kundalini could immerse herself completely in the ocean of love of the Primordial Kundalini. This was the Real pPilgrimage. In real pilgrimage infinite pilgrimages are merely spiritual tourism. An old saying goes, "After killing 900 mice the cat went to Haj". Divine blessings are showered. It turned out that maximum marriages were arranged from Nasik. Shri Mataji arranges the marriages on the vibrations; she never Sahaja Yogis have experienced the real meaning of pilgrimage. In 1998 some notices the place of origin. It was 300 Sahaja Yogis from Nasik started spontaneous blessing to the collectivity.

Our programme shifts from an individual to the collective level and we start feeling a part and parcel of Her universal being. Then Her universal being starts protecting us. An amazing episode occurred in the New Jersey Ashram last collective consciousness. One receives guidance from collective consciousness, under its guidance one's deeds are directed towards collective benevolence. One spontaneously becomes selfless and matures into the collective self. After the year. A Sahaja Yogi boy drowned in the swimming pool. Just then, they said, a phone call came from Shri Mataji, who was at Cabella and She gave a bandhan. pilgrimage of collective consciousness. one starts feeling a part of the Divine collective programme. For inst√§nce, on Feb 20th,99, Shri Mataji had an overwhelming public programme in Mumbai. The Nasik collective instantly After several hours of Medical death the boy recovered. But Shri Mataji said that She never called, She does not even know the phone number of New Jersey Ashrarn. tuned into the collective pattern and organized a major public programme in Nasik showing the video of Shri Mataji's We all know that Shri Mataji never calls anyone. These are not miracles but her bountiful blessings. Now we can realize how much She is always protecting us! Wherever we may be, provided we keep Mumbai programme on a 30-mm screen. It was as though Shri Mataji was herself present. That is a fact, whenever Shri Mataji does a public programme or a puja anywhere, it is a collective event for the ourselves in the zone of collective consciousness. world collectively. Sahaja Yogis can plug into the mains of collective consciousness In many ways we observe collective customs. For instance one Sahaja Yogi offers Her a garland on behalf of the collective. Similarly She may choose one instrument at a particular occasion to communicate a blessing. One should not feel bad that someone else is physically and enjoy its vibrations. Her message can be instantly transmitted through the electronie media and everyone would have the same inner experience, joy and absorption. What She says to one Sahaja Yogi is a message to the collective. Many Sahaja Yogis have experienced that when eloser to Her. She is elose to whoever she clears a certain Chakra of one bears Her in his heart. Say, If She is individual, that Chakra spontaneously pleased with the leader it implies Her clears everyone in the collective. On the pleasure with the collective. Seated on

When we are a part of the same body, we are elated by the praise our collective ears receive and rejoice the gift, Her resplendent throne in Ganapatipule one smile from Her opens the hearts of thousands assembled there. Whoever pleases Her evokes a thousand blessings from Her. That is how we feel transported to the high heavens, during the magical evenings at Ganapatipule. the extensions of our hands receive. In all these deeds the love of our Divine Mother touches our soul, we proclaim Her glory and enjoy Her infinite love. All the saints from the great Markandeya to Shri Adi Shankaracharya have prayed "O Devi, Please teach us how

We are all one with each other and we don't care and enjoy the oneness with each other. If we do not enjoy, we are like a drop out side the ocean. Which can be dried any time. But if you are a part and parcel of that ocean then what happens is that every what sort of differences are outside. I was movement of the ocean you carry with you and you are part and parcel of that ocean, absolutely, because you don't have really very much touched becauIse now the new year is coming with a new challenge for all of us. We have to accept that Kaliyuga is over and we have to establish the Satya Yuga for which all of separate identity. All these things that make a separate you, from every country should have identity, in our society or in our culture, thinking that how you can do it in your or in our behaviour, in personal lives all country and other countries. What are the should be completely curbed down. This problems in other countries? Put your will settle many problems, from family life attention outside, not inside, this way that to national life, to international life. So you should say that I need this, I need we should curb down all such feelings of that. We should know what other people separatedness, that we should have need, What is their need. What the people separate house, separate state, separate in our society, in our nation, in our world nation. Gradually all nations will become require. Better write them down, what one, Lam sure of that, because great times do they require? Its better, it will work, are coming and so many pcopie at the might be, it might be corrected. Its very helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga. important for Sahaja Yogis to sit-down Once they take to Sahaja Yoga, then things would be very much different. Today it is not with them, Sahaja Yoga is not with them. They have no knowledge of our great movement of love. So they want to have separate of every thing. They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away with the heat around or may be with the rain they will be washed away, or may be that Mother Earth might and write down what the world needs and what is to be done. It will be a nice idea for all of you to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society that we have here today. One day, you will be surprised, that we will be the one's who will guide and lead the rest of the people with our love, attention and care. So its very important time and at this time you should think on those lines. absorb them. So we all should be together whatever may be the differences, in different families you are born after all, all cannot be born in one family. But now Thank you very much. May God Bless You. you belong to Sahaja Yoga family and

 7 May-June 1999 Volume XI Issue:5&6 The Divine Cool Breeze 76th Birthday- Felicitation Programme Talk By Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi, Delhi: 19-3-99 one of the deities who was supposed to bring in Kali Yuga and all the problems of Kali Yuga. bow to all the seekers of truth. All this being said on my birthday really embarrasses me because its all being already scheduled, it was all timed out. It Firstly it creates illusions (Bhranti). It had to happen this way, and the time has creates illusions. People will not come now that this whole world has to understand who is the real person, who is unreal person. So we have many false Gurus, as you know, we have many false propagandists, we have many people who talk big but there is nothing in them. This is one type of a (Bhranti) illusion that Kaliyuga creates. Once it so happened that Nala and Damayanti were in love with each other, they were husband and wife. Damayanti was separated from Nala by this horrible fellow called Kali. This take to global understanding how human beings, I was surprised, were anxious, in those difficult times, to get to the truth because it is very difficult to carry on with the truth where there is untruth all along. The way people get after you, when you talk of truth, is also a very hazardous task- to fight those who are just always vowing to cruelties, to untruth, to aggressiveness. These are all self destructive elements. Also we have other self destructive Kali has been doing this kind of work to elements within us like drinking, smoking, drug taking. But people do it. Just they create the problems in the minds of do it, not that they don't know, but they people, disturbing families. disturbing just do it, because of the influence of the nations, disturbing all the good wishes and time. That is what is the Kaliyuga where the good feelings among human beings. we destroy ourselves and try to destroy So once this gentleman, Kali, was caught others and have a kind of a funny up by Nala-the one who hated him. Nala temptation for this. Not only that, also said that why don't you allow me to kill we enjoy all this, all this cruelty, all this you? You should be killed because you aggression we enjoy. Now when we say are such a horrible person, you create that the Kali Yuga is over, we should such ( ) illusion, you create such problems for people. He said, if you want know something about Kaliyuga. Kali was

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume : XI Issue:5 & 6 May- June 1999 I don't know, what it is. But we start to kill me, you can kill me but first listen to my importance, to my Hel44. What is your Helu, what is your importance? He said my importance is that when I will feeling jealous and out of jealousy we start hating people without any rime and reason. So many countries have this come on this earth, when I will rule on problem. The top politicians indulge in this kind of hatred for other people, this earth, I know there will be ia, there will be chaos, there will be problems, but people will be so much fed up with that, that they will seek the truth. Those people without understanding what is the achievement of the other person? How he has achieved? Why should I be jealous? who are going to the hills today to find out the truth will be there as ordinary Apart from that we have another problem which is the worse thing, as Krishna has said. It is the temper. Hot human beings, as house holders. Thev will find the truth, definitely they will find the tempered people, you see, can not see the truth because at the slightest provocation truth. It has been already predicted by Kali himself. So as you see lots of chaos is there, lots of problems are there and when you see people, you can't understand how such people who are educated, intelligent, they become hot and start hitting others and beating others or saying horrible things which should not be said. Now this is another criteria for every Sahaja Yogi supposed to be at the helms of affairs can go about with wrong ideas, with wrong things? The problem is, this Kali Yuga to know how far he is out of this sense of krodha', the anger? To be angry shows that you have no peace within, and you creates this funny situation in our lives. get angry just to attack another person, which is not necessary. Even Firstly it creates the situation where a person starts thinking he is very insecure keeping quiet you can be very much and he must take to some way of effective. There is a story about Chinese protecting himself. Then where he goes people, that in China there was a fight is the place where he will be destroyed going on between some people and they before he knows even that he will be said lets have the cocks fight for us. So destroyed. they had a cock fight. One person took a cock to Zen fellow. He said, what should I do with this cock so that it fights. He The second point is that we have a great sense of jealously. That sense of jealousy is even more heightened by this Kaliyuga. We feel jealous for every thing, which shows our inferiority complex or, said that it is very simple, you teach the cock to be absolutely quiet. He said I cannot do that. He said, alright, give me the cock and he taught the cock how to

 Volume : XI Issue : 5 & 6 May-June 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze be quiet whatever is happening, see, something we cannot conceive with this mind. It is beyond the mind that it works. I was surprised, in Russia whosoever is attacking him. When he went in to the arena, many cocks started attacking him and he was just standing quietly, watching at everyone. This settled the things because every body ran away. They thought he is such a powerful thing he is not saying anything. So not attacking, not reacting is what he had especially, I had to face the scientists. The scientists were so much equipped, so much deep and they understood so well. Even in a place, you can call it a place of great learning, one of the oldest Petersberg "Saint universities, achieved. University'. I don't know what made Actually reaction is a very great them give me the highest reward? For what? I do not know, but they said you enemy of human beings. We react to are even higher then Science. So this they every thing. We should not react, we called as Cognitive Science. They give a name as Cognitive Science. So Mother should just become silent and then this power which, I tell you about, is the power of Paramachaitanya acts. If you want to react all right, it says 'go ahead' and if you leave it and you just become quiet, silent, it acts. It acts so well, it can act sitting down here, it can act some where else. It is such a tremendous power, your all knowledge is of Cognitive Science. Only thing is, if I tell you some thing, then you can verify it, the scientist can verify it, every body can find it out if it is so or not. But if you put this test to all these false Gurus, you will see that they don't have any scientific basis. They have it is such an effective power! It is such an understanding, knowledgeable power and above all it loves. It loves you. So when no way of giving you any explanation as to why this is happening or what is happening. I had to face all of them all this power comes into existence, in a way over the world, and I was surprised they recognized me. They said Mother this is Cognitive Science and like that every- where they gave me awards and things like that. I never knew what the Cognitive I would say it has always been existing, but when it is effective, in the krita yuga it is effective, by that you will be amazed how things happen! Every body tells me Mother this miracle has taken place, that miracle has taken place; So I know it is Science is but this is the knowledge that you get beyond your mind. With your mind you get your bias, may be full of jealousy, may be full of anger. But beyond the mind when you get this knowledge, not miracle, it is parama chaitanya which is doing all the work, all beautiful things, which is trying to help you and trying to suggest its love. It is something we can't

 Volume : XI IssUe 5& 6 10 May-June 199 The Divine Cool Breeze back, of which we are not aware. Like, must say, Indians suddenly became very westerernized after independence. Somehow, all Gandhiji's ideas and every thing was put on the shelves. So we did not know what was so great in our that is absolute. Nobody can challenge it. It is absolute knowledge. For example I will tell you one thing, I told them that I carbon atom has made the Muladhara Chakra, the first chakra. This Muladhara Chakra gives you, out of carbon atoms, a special type of construction. If you country! Such a great Sampada, such a could photograph it and make a model great power existed in this country! They knew so many things, so many things: about something that science do not know. Now it is for the science to find out of it, and if you see this model from the right side to the left side, it will look like a Swastika. I made a model for them out whatever they have said is true or not. to show. If you see it from the left side to Ihave seen it is very simple. If you really know the truth and you tell a scientist, he will get after it and it will work it out. It the right side, it will be 3 written down. If you see from down upward it is a cross, that means Shri Ganesha who is on Muladhara incarnates as Christ. So they is not one example. There can be made a picture, they made a model, the hundreds, I can give you where I have scientists, and they found out that what I told them something, they said alright. said is true and this model really can be You verify, you find out by your scientific methods and they found it. They found it! So many ways of finding it out, you have in science. But they don't know what to find!They are just going on in this one, that one they are going to the moon, they are going to this thing. That's not the way. First you find out what you have to find and then see if it is there or not. I was surprised, in the West, though we call them very much, sort of, advanced and all this thing! But as far as spirituality is concerned they are no where. Their Cognitive Science faculty is very poor compared to us; but our's also is zero because we have all become Westernized now. All our ideas are Westernized and shown. I mean one of them is like this. So whatever you know, whatever you say, should be verified by even scientists. do not discard science. Science is amoral, whatever you may say, but once they come to Sahaja Yoga, these scientists, they just get transformed. But scientists in other countries, I don't know about our country, have reached such a state, such a state that they want to know what is beyond. Allof them come to India. Why? Why don't they go to Japan, why don't they go to China. America? To find the truth they come to India. So in India this Cognitive Science existed long time

 May June 1999 Volume : XI Issue: 5& 6 11 The Divine Cool Breeze nonsensical ideas of religion, cast, nation, this. that. It separates human beings from human beings. But artificially you can not join. Many people start talking 'no no, we should not have all these different we take all the knowledge from outside and even those who want to do something about Indian culture and all that, they are so small, they are so incapable of telling them as to what it is! It has nothing to do with a fundamentalist idea, nothing of the kind. But it is a fact, it is the truth, it is the reality which they don't know themselves. They just want to proclaim things. we should have one.' You cannot. You can't have because temperamentally human beings are not made like We had a little discussion there in Italy the Bharatiya Sanskriti, Indian culture, but there is nothing like that: because unless and until you are a realized soul with other religious groups and they said to me, "we don't want one religion, one global religion we don't want." I said, 'Why"? Because you want to fight, that's and you have reached that state, till then you do not know anything about the mysteries of Parama Chaitanya. So for every Indian, it is very important to take to Sahaja Yoga. Also for all the people why? Why you don't want one religion? One religion is that you are a human being and you are a wonderful human being and that you can be one with the divine. This all over the world, every where, I told you about the Russia; the condition is very bad. But still, I must say, the Sahaja Yogis are very much happy there. When I was is your religion which is promised and has to work out. But they wouldn't accept. Now the people are changing. They are transforming themselves so fast that, I am there once, the coup was on and surprised, in a country like Turkey, we have two thousand Sahaja Yogis. They are converting so many. So all these funny ideas that these priests, Mullas and all everybody was worried and saw lots of tankers passing. So I asked these Russian Sahaja Yogis, they are more than, I think, one lakh, much more than one lakh, I those have created are going down; and don't know how many they are. So I asked them 'Aren't you worried over what is happening in your country?" They what is coming up? Even we have lots of these people in India, pandits and Shastras and this and that. They don't know said Mother we are not. I said, "Why'? Because we are in the kingdom of God. Why should we worry about Russia? The anything, I would say, because unless and until they feel the Paramachaitanya, their all talking is baseless. temperament changes and a person does not tell lies but he really feels that way. That's how he gets rid of all these So all these problems which are created by fighting, by aggressiveness,

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume : XI Isue : 5 & 6 May - June 1999 12 showing off or whatever you may call, we had sufis in so many countries. They all have tried to say that take your self- can be corrected with Sahaja Yoga realization, Know Thyself. They all have because your attention goes beyond the mind, you go beyond the mind. This said the same thing, 'Know Thyself". But Agnya Chakra opens and you go beyond the mind and you are one with this Divine nobody is doing that. That's a different point, but actually all those who were Power. Once you have divine power, how it works for you in small small ways! I mean you all have experienced, you are all Sahaja Yogis, so I need not tell you. realized souls, whether they were from a Muslim Religion or a Hindu Religion or a Christian Religion, any religion, in any country, if they were realized souls, they But every one can tell so many examples said the same, because truth is the by which he knows that this is the same. They said the same thing that first Paramachaitanya which has worked it. So first and foremost thing of every seeker the truth. So this is the essence of our life of truth, who is a real person, is to first that we have to know ourselves. Once get self realization. That is the essence of we know ourselves, you are beyond every spirituality all over the world, even if you thing, because what happens is that you read Bible, if you read Koran. Nobody become like a drop becomes the ocean. has read them, that's the best part of it How it disappears! The same thing will and they are trying to say things which happen and once it happens, you will be are very shameful, which are not there, surprised, that you are really one with they are fighting for that. With all these things they have helped us very much to show that the essence of all these religions Sahaja Yoga, many people say its a big is one and out of that one day people will charisma, its a big miracle. Nothing of the take to self-realization. Once they take kind; you have your own Kundalini, you to self-realization then they have to grow. have own possibility of becoming self Once they have grown into it, they can realized. see. All of you know, you are all Sahaja Yogis-sitting here, you know how much you have gained and how much you have Kaliyuga this was going to happen and achieved. So to give me the credit, I don't that's what is happening, that's why know, is not really true because we had thousands of you are getting realization. Know Thyself and then you will know everyone. Who is the other? You are one with everyone. That is how we find, in That is the blessing of Kaliyuga. In the Before that only one would get from one great saints in our country, great saints in person and those Gurus were also very this country, in every country. You know,

 13 Volume: XI isue:5&6 May- June 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze strict, they would not give it to some people can get it, because any discovery, ordinary person. They used to take them supposing the electricity; if it cannot be to task and judge them first, and then they used amass then it is useless. So that is would give realization. But in Sahaja the only thing I have been able to achieve Yoga we don't do it. We just have to get in my life that amass realization can be them in to Sahaja Yoga, that's all! Now given. And that has happened, as you as it is, I am surprised that how know, very well. It is very simple and once intellectuals try to find faults without knowing that they don't know any thing! give realization to others. Now first they They have to become self realized people. were telling me Mother we are working then what ever they will do, that will be in seventy countries, now they are telling definitely very constructive, very helpful, me we are in eighty countries. I said, how? and peace giving, harmony giving to the Somebody went there, and did it, whole society. But first of all it has to be somebody visited another country and did within you, if it is not within you, how it. So just imagine, how simple it has can you give it to others? I have been become? How simple it is for me? At this watching, how Sahaja Yoga has grown age Ican't go to seventy, eighty countries. from one person to all these, so many of but it has passed there, has gone there.

 Volume :XIissue:5&6 The Divine Cool Breeze May-June 1999 15 NAVARATRI PUJA, Cabella : 27-09-98 Talk by Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi. (You All Should Depend on Parama Chaitanya) ou cannot imagine how a you do not have to read some sort of a poetry or going to some romantic mood. Just pure love which emits and this is the knowledge also. mother, who has so many beautiful children sees them in such joyous mood, with their families, their children nicely settled down! Very How you have to relate it is this way: satisfying to see you all so much in joy and complete oneness with the Divine. The knowledge that you have about One has to realise only one thing that yourself and about others also is though you are many, still compared to evident, is absolutely expressed on your the population of this world we are very finger tips. You know about others and few who really know the true knowledge, about yourself. This is the greatest the real knowledge. You are the people subtle knowledge you have. No one who are knowledgeable, no doubt, but knows like that. Apart from you also knowledge which has not been people, no one knows about themselves adorned with truth or which is not the or about others. So this knowledge that true knowledge, has no meaning. All that has come to you, is extremely subtle, vanishes into thin air because it is artificial. extremely secretive, absolutely seeret. If By your Kundalini awakening you all have you know about somebody, you know. achieved that state where, we can say you Others do not know that you know about know; you know what the real knowledge them. So this knowledge that you have is. But think of the people who do not got is nothing but love. know what knowledge is. It is very difficult to make knowledge and love put together because our idea of knowledge is very different, from what we read from the books. How can you love from the books? What love means For example we say that our knowledge is nothing but love. But one should understand the discrimination. The knowledge that is love within you is just to us is our attachment. In ignorance you get attached to the people, to children, emitting out from your being. You do not have to assert, you do not have to think,

 Volume : XI Isue : 5 & 6 May - June 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze 16 that then your knowledge is not with love. It is such a connection between the two. to family, to things. By getting attachment it is proved that we do not have the knowledge. If you have the knowledge, then all attachments should just drop out and you should become a global personality, a drop in the ocean. For example we are attached to many things like we are attached to our family. If You feel like telling every body that you got your realisation. You feel like telling everyone that you are a realised soul, but in that you feel that you are expressing your ego. Alright, by some other way, by some other method you can express to something happens in the family we get them that you have the true knowledge. very disturbed. We cannot bear it. If When you have the false knowledge anything happens to our children we feel you can get ego. You can think that I know so much. I know about these, I horrible, its just the whole world falling on you. Then from family you move on. know the colour of the carpets, all the shades, everything. Any stupid thing you know, you think that you are very great. You are attached to your friends, to your neighbours. You are also attached to your country. Attachment to your country is also not knowledge. Once you are a That is the sign of stupidity in your head realised soul, you just start seeing your also that you think that this is very great country clearly. What wrong it has got, what ignorance it has got, in what darkness it exists and in what way it is acquiring all kinds of knowledge in the quarrelling, fighting for rights and things? whole world, what we have achieved? But with the knowledge that you have Nothing. There are wars going on. There within yourself, you see it so clearly as to what is the problem of your country. Then you try to improve that through your love; wind which is going round and it is killing means the power of your knowledge is so many people and it is destroying so to know. Now we have discovered that through are all kinds of destruction coming in. I saw in television, this George. It is a world love. many people, without understanding what he is doing! But he is there and he is acting very well. So is it that he does not understand? Or is it that he understands and that he does something just to correct If you have all the knowledge within you and if you are just sitting at home and meditating, it has no meaning. What you have to do is to go about, you have people. This also we should have full idea. Yesterday when I came here it was raining heavily, I sat down and suddenly it to meet other people, your friends, your family and other relations and tell them about your knowledge. If you cannot do

 17 May June 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume: XI Issue: 5& 6 I react to it, but if I do not react then I will know whether this carpet has got vibrations or not. That is all. Are they stopped, stopped till the whole programme was over. Till I spoke it was not raining. But suddenly when you started clapping, also it started raining. That is what it was. So even the nature emitting vibrations or not? Now what are these vibrations? That is the love. So the knows who you are, but you must communication is like this. If you have know the nature. This is the point. the light you can see things. Nature will act according to what your So when you see things, the light is there. level of spirituality is. Surprisingly, 1 Light gives you perception, gives you always felt that there cannot be levels of the vision to see things. In the same way when spirituality. I felt that once you get realisation you are there. But later on I these vibrations start flowing just like a discovered that I was wrong. It is not so. light and in that light you can see things Even after getting realisation I found which are good and which are bad. But people had so many obstructions in rising. sometimes you put the same parameter you are enlightened, what happens that There were so many temptations which were keeping them down. So one has to as human beings do. Like you may go to some house; very nice house, very good house, all these things make you very happy but actually what about that house? Is it having good vibrations or it is having work out on different Chakras, different Nadis, somehow or other you make yourself perfect, because the perfection within only will give you the authority to use this knowledge. bad vibrations? Is it worth living there or not. Like the other day they told me they There are, 1 told you, two ways of can get a very nice place in Milan, on rent, doing it. The other day I told you that. you should not react. It is human nature Immediately I felt the vibrations of the very cheap. I said why it is so cheap? to react, absolutely human; but if you are place. I said, did you go and see the to become super human you should not react. By not reacting you will grow, vibrations of that place? They went and saw this was all burning. Then they found definitely you will grow but if you react out that there was a Saintology there for then you cannot grow, because you are working under the pressure of other thing years together. I said that is not the place that is not yourself. Now supposing, as I where you can live. You have to have a very pure place. Even that of a poor man could be better than this comfortable, so So one has to use the said, I see this carpet. I know the colour and this and that and I react to it. Finished. I will not have any sense of judgement if called, place.

 Volume : XI Isue :5 & 6 May - June 1999 18 The Divine Cool Breeze comes there is sunlight. So what is the difference? Or we can say the Moon and vibrations all the time to understand everything that you are doing. the moonlight. What is the difference? In that also you can be misleading. There is no difference in these two things. Some people feel vibrations and they tell One is the Moon and another is the light. me, 'Mother, I felt the vibrations and I So all these things are very very felt that I should marry this man.' I said, confusing, that we do no understand how Did you feel the vibrations? Yes, yes I confused we are about it and we do not did very much andI must marry this man. understand how our vibrations can When I see the man, I see the Bhoots in mislead us, because vibrations are there him. I said, my God what sort of alright but sometimes even if they are vibrations this lady has felt about him? missing, just to justify yourself you will say we have vibrations and we feel that it So in your judgement what is there, there is no pure knowledge. is very good, excellent and later on you You see how connected they are. will discover that is not so. So even now Vibrations which is love and also the other when we are realised souls we should thing which you have to have is the know what is encompassing us, which is knowledge, the pure knowledge, the true around us. What is that which makes us knowledge. You can say that the pure feel that it is alright, it is good, we should knowledge and true knowledge is like the have it? Once we start understanding that energy, like electricity and the way you vibrations are pure knowledge, are of a feel it, the way you understand it, it exists. very different nature, then you are not That is love. People do not understand attached to that person, you are not also what the love is. They get mad after attached to that family, you are not someone and say that Mother, see, I think attached to that country, nothing. What that I am in love with that person and after you feel is the pure vibrations come into five days they will come and say, Mother, you. This is the point which is very no, I would not have anything to do with confusing. When you say my vibrations that person. Why? Because you have not are good, I like those vibrations, and while got the pure knowledge. You did not feel you jump into the ocean of filth! the pure knowledge in that person through your vibrations. Now see how why is it sometimes we make mistakes'? connected it is, like you can say the Sun You do not make mistakes. It is your Many people have asked me, 'Mother, and sunlight. What is the difference ignorance which is darkness and that is between the two? Sun is there. When Sun why whenever you plunge into it you fall

 19 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume : XI Issue :5 & 6 May- June 1999 into trouble. So to understand that our them are murdered and like that all that idea that we will have this possession of the land, goes away. knowledge has to be completely clear, like in our house, supposing we have a lamp which is dirty, you cannot get the light. In the same way if your heart is not clean, So in the same way we can see on specially our heart, if it is not clean then smaller things also. In smaller things also you start doing things, believing that it is we are very much identified that if I have right, by which you hurt yourself and this thing then everything will be fine. You others. It is a very very common error in cannot understand how people just jump human nature to identify wrong things as at things and say, Oh Mother, this is ours, right, just to make themselves look such such a divine thing! this is ours, we must use this for ourselves, openly! They do not think it is a great, Wrong. To say that this is my country, must do for my country, and another says As I told you, now there are people who want to divide the country. Simple this is my country, I must do for my country. As long as there is this My and I, that means there is no knowledge. reason they want to divide. Now they want to divide because they want to have importance. A few people who want their importance will instigate others, tell them, alright we must have freedom. If we have knowledge is that which gives you a pure freedom, we will have this country for light. Pure light means pure vibrations. ourselves, then we can develop ourselves Now vibrations can be misleading as I told or a part of a country which is richer, you, or could be the quantity of vibrations which is better off, they will think that it can be less or more. There is another way. is alright, we will have all the money to It is to see for yourself why do you want ourselves, we will have everything to to do a particular thing? Mentally also you ourselves. So they divide, they can divide can use parameter of mental in the name of religion, in the name of understanding. Why do I want to do it? prosperity, whatever it is, but if you divide What is the gain for all the people. If you the country, actually you are facing a big Start thinking from that angle, what is the problem. You have seen that wherever gain for others, what will they gain by people divide, they fall into a kind of a this, why should I do it, you will be dark ditch from where they cannot come amazed, you will get the real picture of out. It is just a few people whose ego is what you are doing. So you must keep that they want to have some land as their yourself all the time in a state where you own, but they die. Not only die, some of witness yourself, you see yourself that The knowledge as I told you, pure

What is the purpose. you been wise to do something or you Sometimes could be some conditioning, have been just doing it because you are could be some sort of psychological thing, identified with a particular type of life or could be anything. But if you start a particular type of answer? So wisdom watching carefully, why I am doing it, you is a thing that gives you first of all will be amazed that your vibrations itself complete peace. If your wisdom is will start telling you on your finger tips. developed then you become very But sometimes, the vibrations are so peaceful, because whatever people may superficially coming, Ah, I got the say, whatever they may do, whatever vibrations, I am this, I am that! What is aggression they may do, whatever it is, the reason, Why I am saying again and you are peaceful, and you see the stupidity again though you are such a nice family of the other person, of the other nations of mine and you are also much blessed and you understand why they are doing. and we have so much of knowledge with This wisdom is such an important thing us? We should be very wise. If there is no in human beings because animals do not wisdom, we can never understand what have so much wisdom as we have. we are doing. Sometimes, of course, we have even less than animals but still by experience, you Now to develop this wisdom what see, we have to learn that we have been making mistakes. So many mistakes we have committed so far. Now are we going to commit more mistakes? Or are we going to be wise? Wisdom is not apparent have we to do? So every time they will come and say, Mother how do we get wisdom? What is the way to get the wisdom? Wisdom you have already within you. Shri Ganesha is already there who gives you the wisdom, but you must take to Shri Ganesha. There are people who outside. You cannot say somebody is wise while looking at that person. But in vibrations you will know that person is become so much addicted to Shri Ganesha that they lose his identity extremely wise. He may speak, he may not speak. If he speaks he will speak completely. They become very slavish about the whole thing and they just about something so deep, so wise and so believe that they are very spiritual, they nice without hurting others. This kind of are very great. All these false ideas are temperament if you develop is to become no good. Does your Ganesha give you wise for every question. For example some are very attached to their children. So much attached that they forget that wisdom? Now you must count how many wise things have you done so far, where they are part and parcel of this Divine did you take a very wise decision? Have

The other day I met one lady whose son was very sick. She took him to the hospital and doctors gave him all say, and in that you should see the wisdom helps. Of course my attention is there always, no doubt, but still you should not take it for granted. You have to ask. One day, you see, I was just sitting. I just thought that I should telephone somebody kinds of medicines and he became even worse. Then she telephoned to me, Mother I do not know what happened? I went to the doctor and the doctor gave in the Ashram of New York. I never telephone there. So I found out the phone number and telephoned and asked "is the child alright?" So the leader there was surprised because that boy had fallen in him this and that treatment and the child has become worse. But why did not you ask me before? Why did you go to the hospital first? Lack of wisdom. I am there. Why don't you ask me. the water and was in the water for quite We had one case here in Cabella. One some time and he was all filled with water, even his brain was filled with water. As usual there was some doctor who said Now the mother did not show any that he cannot survive and even if he child who fell down and broke his arm. wisdom. She took the child to the hospital and the doctor said, tomorrow we are going to operate her and put some artificial arm, but the father was sensible. Survives, his brain has so much water that he cannot be normal. So I just said that do not worry. I did not know. No body told me. Do not worry, the boy will be He said alright, tomorrow? Today I will nght completely. So they were surprised how I said so. Firstly how I knew that take the child home. He brought the child to me at night at about 3 0'elock. I said the boy had fallen, there was some boy alright. I put it right. Next day when he took him to the hospital, the Doctor said, like that and then they did not know how "Now there is no need to operate because I said he will be alright! And he was his arm is alright. See the differene. One alright. He was perfectly alright. So they is worried. Immediately they will go to were surprised over my knowing about the doctor instead of consulting me. it. How is it that Mother knows that there asking me. They are Sahaja Yogis but they is a boy who is so sick. Here, I will say it will go and ask the doctor to do is pure knowledge. You see my attention something. When the doctor starts doing something then they will come to me.. is always around you, always dealing with you and how I know is this that this attention of mine is global. So if anything happens to you, any There are lots of miracles which have

 22 Volume: XI lssue : 5& 6 May-June 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze upsetting takes place, any, I should say, deviation takes place, my attention is within you. That is the level some people are and I am not so sure about those who get realisation are all so much filled with pure knowledge. Some of them are but not all of them. With experience they learn. With meeting people they learn but as the wisdom, pure wisdom is difficult for them because they do not rely entirely on the Parama Chaitanya. Everything there. Immediately I know there is something wrong somewhere and I do not know how my attention goes to particular place which makes its life better. It helps I do not do anything about people in need. this attention but this attention is the wisdom. The wisdom that spreads all happens, just Parama Chaitanya knows it. It understands, it organizes, it loves, it does everything that is the energy it is. It does everything and how it manages, how because coincidences are really organised by Parama Chaitanya! over. With that wisdom, you know, what is wrong with another person or any other organization that is in Sahaja Yoga. Everything you come to know. If you want to know is different. It is just you know like you spread out every where. Forexample if you have to telephone then you have to use the telephone but for me I do not have to use the telephone, I just As I told you yesterday the way the rain was. The rain came and went away. It was wisdom. Innately it knows I am know. So this has come from a pure sitting here, the programme is going to innocent wisdom. The innocent wisdom start, it stops. Flowers know me. You do is just like a child. It is everywhere and it communicates and it tells what is the not know, when we have flowers they are all this size. I do not do anything to them. matter and what the problem is. Many They start growing, growing, blast like that! Now one would say, Mother how do I know? Because they are natural. We people have been cured with Sahaja Yoga. Many have been cured. Now if they can say, 'Mother, how did we get cured, what have you done? Did you see our Chakras, did you find out what is wrong with us?" No, I have not. I have not but I leave it. In my wisdom I leave it to Parama Chaitanya to do the job. This is the point, main point is that you can leave everything to Parama Chaitanya in your wisdom? If you cannot, then yet you have not felt the real knowledge are unnatural. We have taken so many artificialities as part and parcel of life. See all kinds of courtesies, these that, all that softness is there. All these stupid practices that we have adopted, sometimes keeps us away from pure knowledge and when there is no pure knowledge we do not know anything, what is happening. You just get frightened for small things, upset for small things. I mean it is something

 May- June 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze 23 Volume: XI Isue :5& 6 wisdom to leave everything to Parama Chaitanya? After experiences also, like there was one lady who was going in the car. She found her car's brakes were very surprising to see Sahaja Yogis getting upset. Among the hundred people, if supposing there is a problem; so if they are Sahaja Yogis they have to just witness and see. If you can not do that then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. It is not like practising; you know like they say if you have to have the blessings of Shiva you must say 108 times his names. That is not the way. He does not like it. You see no breaking. She did not know what to do about! Now brakes are no more. How to manage? It was in Germany. All the cars were moving very fast and she did not know what to do. So she put her head on the steering wheel and she said that I body likes that kind of a murmuring. You leave it to Parama Chaitanya'. She said, "She leaves it to Me? Alright, it is the same. So by saying that what happened. she said, 'Mother I do not know, when I wrong idea that you go on taking the raised my head, I found my car was taken rame of somebody and that Deity will on one side of the road and no body was help you. First of all you have to become there'. All the cars were passing by but wise enough to understand that you are a somehow or the other this car was taken part and parcel of Parama Chaitanya. there, very nicely, by some force. So the Everything will work out by that and it wisdom lies in understanding the working works out so beautifully. Of course some of Parama Chaitanya how it guides you, people have hard time. I do not say they how it helps you, how it preserves you, do not have, but it is not hard because if how depending on Parama Chaitanya you are one with Parama Chaitanya and can continue to be living very happy. see somebody comes and takes your name all the time near your door you will throw him out. So that is not the way. It is a you you know that it is doing the job, you are not feeling that hardness or sickness or I think in Sahaja Yoga we have lost anything. All the people write to me about very few Sahaja Yogis. They live for long their problems. I do not know what to They do not die and if you ask their say. You just say that do you believe in experience it is very amazing. How it Parama Chaitanya? Alright, it knows. It works out? If they do not want to live knows what is to be said. See, it can create they can pass also but if they want to live, poetry, it can create music, it can create Parama Chaitanya takes over and you can everything. But do you leave everything live long. But living long does not mean to the Parama Chaitanya? This is the that you can go on bothering yourself as second point in wisdom. Do you have to what you will do with your money, how

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume : XI Isue :5& 6 May-June 1999 24 we will give to the doctors, we give it to some civil people, what you call them, engineers to do something. They can make mistakes, they can create problems. You leave it to Parama Chaitanya. It is something so remarkable that in my own life I have seen that at all the times it will you live, what will be the source? All these nonsensical things, worries come to you. Alright, then the Parama Chaitanya says alright, go on worrying. If you go on worrying, alright go on worrying. Does not matter that will happen? Whatever has to happen will happen. But Parama Chaitanya can interfere in case we leave it to Parama Chaitanya. He said works well. I was building a house in Poona and we had to put a slab, very very big slab, needed about three hundred bags of cement for that. So I got the cement and I got the people but they said you start early in the morning and you can finish next morning, 24 hours. I said alright. So many a times leave it to God, leave it to God but God means, 'I do not know what they mean by God'. God is Parama Chaitanya. God means living Divine Force that is working everything. So the another way of looking at it is the wisdom that we should understand that each and every particle of this World is created by at about 5 O'clock I told let us go, the Divine, by the Divine force; and this work is over. They said how do you particle, everything is completely under know?I said I know, let us go. So imagine the guidance and supervision of Parama it was going to finish after 12 hours, was Chaitanya. Nothing can move unless and already finished and all the workers were until Parama Chaitanya works out. It is walking about. Everybody said, "Mother something so connected, globally so it is a miracle." How can such a big slab much there, that people do not realise be laid in such a short time?" To make what they are doing, what they should them understand, I said, you see, have done. I mean on many scales you Hanumana must have done the job. All find something happening. That these people, all these Deities are part and supposing something is happening now parcel of that Parama Chaitanya. Now in America. Just try to find out what you are worshipping the Mother. To America has done to other countries? worship the Mother is the biggest thing because all these Deities and everybody Immediately you will get the answer. So also it takes full care of the persons who believe in Parama Chaitanya, who give are Her Children, under Her Command, under Her desire. There is a story as you know, about Ganesha that the mother said everything in the hands of Parama that the one who goes round the Mother Chaitanya. We give things to the police.

 The Divine Oool Breeze Volume : XI Issue : 5& 8 May- June 1999 25 earth three time, I will give hima Present. So Shri Ganesha thought in his wisdom who is greater than my Mother? No one just know it. So I am not saying that develop your knowledge to that extent that you can do it but your wisdom. If you start using your wisdom, it will always come handy. In any thing that you do, think of the wisdom. My advice to you else because he knew that he cannot compete with his brother who had got a peacock for the conveyance. So he said how can I go round and win over this you is that as your Mother does the whole present. So best is to take to wisdom. My Mother is greater, is greater than everything else. So he went round his mother three times and he got the prize as the other brother was just still moving on. When he came back he found that the work, loves all of you and cares for those who have not even got realisation, you should also try to create more people for Sahaja Yoga. In that if you start behaving in a manner and all the times saying you are catching this, you are a Bhoot, you are this, you are that! I never said that to present is already lost. any one. So you should not say like that. That is no love. That is no understanding. The understanding is that you were just So again and again I am saying it is the wisdom that helps. The wisdom to leave everything to Parama Chaitanya for a modern person, this is something very difficult to understand. He cannot calculate two plus two. It is so bad the same as the person was and noW you are knowledgeable. So you must use your knowledge to correct that person, not to put him down and that correction is also not verbal. It is just through your because of these computers and things like that. It is absolutely hopeless as far vibrations you can correct the other as any mathematical calculations are nerso person. needed. Now, I do not know how to handle any computer or any calculator but if you ask me just like that, "Mother, how much it will be?" I will say so much and it will be there. It will be there. I am so sure about it. It cannot be anything else but that and it works that way. Sometimes, of course, if I want to tell some wrong thing just to mislead the person then I may Most of the Sahaja Yoga work, sometimes I have seen stops because we are very methodical, become like great teachers, start telling them stories and then they get fed up. So when you are handling other people, as I said, we have to spread the knowledge, very important. We cannot keep it to ourselves. But it is say something, but normally I know it is that, but I know, not like the way we not for any ambition, for any leadership, for any kind of recognition. We use our know. I just know it. That is what it is. wisdom, our knowledge to help others

 Volume : XI Issue :5 & 6 May-June 1999 26 The Divine Cool Breeze heart you have a beautiful image of a out of love, not for any recognition, not for any position, nothing. Just we want person who is very very pure, you cannot, you cannot do anything mentally and from your heart if you have to do, your heart to do it because we love them. I am sure this will work out very effectively and the person who will be helped or the persons who will be helped will be just bound to you because they find the true knowledge. But supposing somebody comes to you and says, I know the true knowledge. You may be knowing it. But I have to know what you know. Then you ask that person, he will give you a big lecture. You say, No that is not the thing, just smile, that is not the thing. The thing is that true knowledge is a part and parcel of your being. It is just within you.
