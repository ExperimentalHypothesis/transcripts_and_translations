Seminar in Santa Cruz, California (USA). 1 October 1983.

I am really enamoured to see so many of my children. I have been able to find them back, it is such a great thing to see them, after such a long time, while I came here 10 years back and none of them could feel the importance of Mother’s love. And now it has worked,  such a tremendous thing has happened that it has worked, and that people are feeling that great thing called, this subtle energy of Mother’s love. Now in these ten years I have been all over the world, Australia, Europe, England, India, but I must tell you, my attention was in America all the time. I was longing for the day when I would feel like coming back to this country because I thought ten years back, it was too early.

They have to learn it, what truth is,  they have to go through it, they had been too (cockshell?)

Unless and until it works out that way, they are not going to accept Sahaja Yoga but what do you accept in Sahaja Yoga is yourself, is  your spirit, is your power of Kundalini and by which the responsibility that, when you get this Realization, you have to settle down with it, know all about it, you have to become a guru, a pure sattwa and the guru of others.  In short Sahaja Yoga is the epitome of our evolution, that is what we are made human beings. All these scientific methods that are caught on this earth, all these explorations that are there are to communicate  about Sahaja Yoga, nothing else, they are not going to be used for anything else. If you use them for anything else they will have no impact, no achievement and everything will be wasted. As I was talking to Dr ..

“Doctor did you talk to them about the peptoms and all that?” No.

All right I asked him to talk to you, that the human mechanism is the highest of all, we have now created the highest thing, we call it as the computer, it goes alongside with our our own building inside. Now the computer has to think, it just can’t do anything without thinking. Now when you see me you are not thinking, you just see me, you see this, you see that, you don’t have to think, going to the process of thinking. Spontaneously you know what it is and they will take thousands of years, they will never be able to produce a computer like that. Then the computer when it starts working, the human computer, is going even ahead of it. When you become the computer, when you get connected with the mains, you know everything because the mechanism within you is the absolute mechanism, the perfect mechanism, it has no defect except that you have misused it, you have almost pressed it or you have taken it to a junk shop for nothing at all. But you will be amazed that you can repair it yourself. The mighty power within you has repaired it, so this power which is within us can repair it, repair. That is the first thing it does is to repair us. We should accept that there is some repair needed in ourselves that is one thing one has to accept, otherwise you cannot go very far with it.

Supposing you buy a fifth hand ship, then you better repair it before putting it to the sea. Like some ladies came to see me off and on from France, so my husband said “what’s this? she must have given you realization, then why are you bothered?”  He is dealing with shipping, you see, so the lady answered “Sir, supposing you buy a fifth hand ship, what will you do?” He said “In all wisdom I will never buy it”. “And even if I buy, after using it for a while if it does not work out we’ll throw it in the sea. We have no patience”. So one has to know that You have to work it out, you have to understand your value and your problem, but you have to work it out, it is very easy to work out yourself.

Like there was one sahaja yogi, he has written this book Advent. One day he came very disturbed, he said Mother, “I’ll ask you a question, if it is yes, you just keep quiet because I will be really blasted, if it is no, it is allright”. I said “What is your question?”. He said “Was I Napoleon in last life?” I said “What makes you think that?”. He said “Because I have a very big ego, I have discovered such a big ego I float suddenly, see, the slightest jump I go floating, that is why. And the second thing is that I can draw very well from my childhood, I have a very strong hand for lines, that he too had. That is why I am rather worried if I was Napoleon”. I said “Non at all, don’t you worry”. Then he was settled down because he said that would be really an abuse of you to give realization to Napoleon, a person like Napoleon.  Now look at that,  once upon a time Napoleon was the hero, I mean, as we were young children in India we had to learn about the greatness of Napoleon, how his childhood was spent and how he conquered countries after countries and his words were used just like some scriptural saying. But now today the same country does not want to accept him as a hero, on the contrary they think he was an idiot to do such things. So the situation has changed now, people have learnt their lessons and they think this is not the way the hero should be.

So now today the hero is say, someone like Mahatma Gandhi or you had Mr King here, all such people, or I would say Abraham Lincoln, he is coming up as a hero.  What is so special about these people, we have to see. They were all realized souls no doubt but one thing more they had was that they imbibed in them the capacity to emit compassion, love, nourishment, and soothing capacity of the Mother Earth. Because of that only they were today respected, they are today respected as great heros. And that is what Sahaja Yogis have to be now. They have done all competition, all nonsense, I mean so many have turned back from that, like they started anti-culture saying  - Oh it is too much, it is sooth and good, it is too much for us, we don’t want to have it. So they turned their back to that and they started seeking, but by seeking also, they went to the other side of it and got lost. Like one fellow came to me, all stinking, his hair was stinking, he never had bath for a year he said, and I said “What is the matter, you’re smelling like a dog”. So he said “I want to be a dog”, I said “But why?” Then said “I like it” but I said “Why are you troubling everybody else you see?” So he says “Mother, but I want to be primitive”. I said “With this brain you can never be primitive. You may change your hat, you may change everything, you may change your hairstyle anything, you cannot become primitive. You are a modern man, accept it. So why trouble others for nothing at all?”

And this is how that we think by our mental projections, by our mental conceptions, we can do something. You can not do anything. Whatever you do becomes absolutely useless. Why? Because as Doctor will explain to you later on, that within us now there is something called peptoms you see, which work out for the neutralizing of our problems with the sugar. Now they have a built-in capacity to be in a spiral shape, they are in a spiral shape, and once they become linear, they lose their biological effect.  Now, according to him that we put in all amino-acids, everything together, we can only create 5% of all that is created by Nature within us. You can imagine how far they have reached with all that advancement, everything: only 5%. Now these peptoms, as they are spiral, everything within us is like that in the sense that our evolution has to take place spirally, it has to move in a spiral way, not linear way like a pendulum. Like men are becoming women, women becoming men,  they are homosexual bisexual that sexual, is all mental projection, is joyless, it doesn’t give you anything at all. All your ideas of democracy, capitalism, communism, all  isms that are nothing but mental projections. They are not reality because you have no capital, what will you distribute? Your capital is your Spirit and when you get that capital within you, distribute, you cannot live without it.

Like me you see, for all practical purposes I am a happily married woman, our friends do not understand what is wrong with this woman, why is she going around, talk to people, what is she doing? Such a big capitalist what is the need for her to go round? But I am a capitalist inside and I must spread this, I must give this, I am the greatest communist I should say that, because I must give it. So the communism, or capitalism, or all these political ideas are absolutely parallel to what is inside, but it is not the inside, is not the genuine thing inside. All these mental projections I have told you, people just start believing. Like people believe that we are twice born. If you want to believe, you can believe you are a dog or an elephant, you can believe whatever you like. But that belief has no meaning, at all, because it is not so. Supposing I believe I am the governor of Los Angeles they will say “you are mad”. That is what it is because if you believe into something and you start acting, it is always a falsehood, isn’t it ?

Now Christ also or anyone of them came they said “you believe in that”, what they were saying?  What Christ said?  that you believe that there is God, that he is the son of God, is a fact but you are not become the son of God. When you start believing that we have Christ in our pocket, then you are sadly mistaken. Christ is very far away from you, just now. So mentally if you accept any situation like that, then you become a complete barrier to truth, then nothing can go into your head because you think “Oh what? I go to church all right, I pay money for the church”. Church is not Christ.  So now churches are selling in England and they are making pubs out of it, actually pubs and people will be even worse there because all dead bodies are lying down below and here they are going for drinking. What is going to happen to their (being)?

It is a serious matter for me. So this is what it is, that when we start believing into something, we also believe we are that.  Some people read Gita and when they read Gita they believe they are Vyasa themselves, the one who wrote it. But some of them believe they are Shri Krishna themselves, to this extent people go to believe that they themselves are Shri Krishna, they talk like Shri Krishna. Now the Shri Krishna’s qualities are there. If I say I am Christ all right, you should say that if you are Christ, walk on the water. And if I say I am I am the Holy Ghost, then you should say, all right raise our Kundalini.  It is said. If you can raise our Kundalini then you are the Holy Ghost, otherwise you cannot, and en-masse. That is the point and if that is so, then you shoud accept someone as something, it is already written down. But on the contrary people start believing they are the Holy Ghost. I met people like that, they said we are the Holy Ghost, we are Christ, we have to just keep it. What an ego. And that is what makes people absolutely closed to truth. They cannot seek truth because they want to believe that they are already there, they have got it, only they have to keep it. It is a wrong thing, you still have to have it. But in our practical life, you don’t do that, you see in practical life supposing we just believe that this is mine, it does not become mine. And if I go and say, no this is mine, I will be put into jail. Anything like that you don’t believe unless and untill you have it. Supposing I say, allright sit down here, there is a chair, will you sit? You first see, it is there. In the same way in our spirituality we are just the opposite, we want to believe because we know that nothing is going to be challenged.

And that is how we close ourself to reality. We have to be, we have to become and that is the problem of Sahaja Yoga that you cannot become a Sahaja Yogi, unless and until you become.  There is no certificate. There is no payment. Thus we cannot say. It has to become. Unless and until you are a tree, we cannot call a seed a tree. That cannot be done.  Nor you would like to call. So that is how it is – we have to humbly accept that we have to become.  If we really humble down on that point that we have to become, that all our knowledge has been of no use it is non knowledge, then only it happens. There was a great poet in India called Surdas, he was a blind poet, he has written lots of poems describing his agony to meet God and such poems people like because they too have the same agony, so they like to sing “When will I meet you, when will it happen” and all that. So he sang all this, but after all that the last thing he wrote was very beautiful  ….

…

That O lord Shri Krishna please remove my non-knowledge, so far I have written “susadaka”, oceans of his poems, he says, is nothing but non-knowledge, so just remove it. The knowledge has to be felt on your consciousness, on your central nervous system, so all other things like people start jumping, going under the blanket, saying that our guru is great. You cannot even make out whether he is a true or non guru, how can you say that he is your guru? A guru has to be a person who knows everything about it and he is above money, above all these material things and he creates nothing but compassion.

I agree many can say that Mother, because you were not here, we went to other people. But it is not true. I was the first to come here. Ten years back I came here but you were not happy with me at that time, you did not like me very much, because I had no Rolls Royces. Oh they actually asked me, “Mother how many Rolls Royces have you got?” I said  “Rolls Royce, for what?” They said “You see they all collect Rolls Royces here”. I said “I have come to collect my own children, I have not come to collect Rolls Royces”.  So they asked me “Then how do you explain these people who come here in the name of God try to collect Rolls Royces?” I said “I cannot explain because I can stoop down to their level, I cannot understand their level because to take even a little bit from someone free itself is parasitic, I mean if someone gives me a present even materially I think I should be paying back, somehow or another, I must return. It is very hard for me to a accept even a little thing from you people whom I am giving this, because I have to give, it is to be given, it is your own, I am like a banker, I have to, it is your right to have it, so I have to give it, and in return to take Rolls Royce is so parasitic and is so below level, there is no self-respect”. So I asked the gentleman who was asking me a question  “Supposing I tell you come in my house and live freely, will you do that?” he said “NO!”

I said “Then, to take a Rolls Royce free from someone on other people’s money, is it not parasitic, what are they doing to get the Rolls Royce, what work have they put in, what material things they are doing that they should ask for Rolls Royce”.

Like that, you see, and people get enamoured by these Rolls Royces. I tell you the gentleman who has Rolls Royce here, I met him before. And he told me unless and until I, he did not know that I know all these things very well, I just can camouflage myself quite a lot and I wanted to know what he is doing to the people, and he said  “You know what is going to impress the people in the West, big big houses and great big cars”. He himself wanted to buy a Mercedes at that time and we had a Mercedes, then he wanted to talk to me about it if I would sell the Mercedes to him. Just imagine, he knew at that time that you people would be more impressed by Rolls Royces, just imagine such a thing to happen.

So we have many contentious and many ideas about things. In Sahaja Yoga gradually they drop out. I don’t want to shock you because you will think “Oh mother  this is also in-born”. Like an homosexual came to me and he asked “Mother what do you think of homosexual” I would touch him, I said “All right I will explain to you, sit down”. I took about half an hour to explain to him how he became homosexual and how it is enslaving him, it is a joyless pursuit, he will never have joy, and moreover those who are today born have a greater responsibility because they should have sane marriages to allow the great saints to be born in this country. Only devils will be born under such circumstances, only devils, who can face a circumstance when mother is marrying ten times, father is marrying twelve times, and the child, his innocence is all the time attacked.

So we have to have sane good marriages if you want the saints to be born here, and without their births we cannot see the saving of this madness that is going on. So but I told him very clearly how it has come. Because yesterday also the day before yesterday I spoke of that, how the homosexual were created in this country or in any country in the West. In India we did not know all this, what is supposed, it is so unnatural, and we must have been primitive people because you are so advanced you know and we do not know about these things, actually I could not eat my food for eight days thinking that now they are doing this, it is too much. But actually what has happened is your laws, your laws are very funny, the laws are such that if a man marries a woman then he is in for trouble because he loses half of his money with the first wife, then half of it with the second, then half of it with the third. By the time he is third time married he is just broke you see, this is the law. I have seen women very rich, very well-off and the husbands absolutely popers. Same lady marrying one husband looking like a poper absolutely has no money so this is one of the law which is very very I think imbalanced and creates a problem between husband and wife quite a lot, because the whole thing becomes money oriented. And I know of somebody who is a great Sahaja Yogini in America, her mother has married now 10 times, she is all the time and now this is her 11th marriage she is arranging. So that is what she is doing and that is how she is quite a moneyed lady and I don’t know how she manages that, how she is befooling so many men and marries them so the marriage becomes just a joke. Secondly this is one of the reasons why men don’t want to marry women, because there is no equality of sharing and that is why, one of the reasons why, they thought it is better to have a man as a companion or a spouse.

Then the second thing which is very wrong within us is that the women don’t understand their responsibility and because men oppressed them so much. At the time of Abraham Lincoln, if you see the men were horrid, absolutely much worse than Indian men, much worse, they used to oppress women, they used to do all kinds of things and women were denying all kinds of vice.  So as a result of that, now women have become men you see, and they have tried to dominate. I mean, when I see an American women, I am quite surprised how they treat their husbands. Now you see that is a trick they must know of the woman how to treat the husband to put him right, you see, she is the mother and the trick you don’t know. Me of course, I mean, our husbands are just with us throughout, but we know the trick and you don’t know the trick, you are trying something, which you,   which which is, which, won’t work out because you are not an instrument for that. For supposing, this is an instrument for emitting my voice and if I start using it for playing a taperecorder it can’t.

So a woman is a woman and a man is a man, and if a man tries to be a woman and a woman tries to be a man, there is going to be a problem. But that does not mean that a woman should sit at home and look after the children, it does not mean that at all, but the woman’s qualities are of nourishment, are of soothing, are of compassion, they are such powerful qualities you don’t know. Your compassion is so great that your children cannot go anywhere. Anything happens they must come to you, the husband cannot go anywhere he has to come, compassion is so pure and so great that the power of compassion you have never realized. This is the power of compassion of God, is his feminine, the mother that is working it out, he is just the witness of the whole show, he is not bothered, if you people don’t behave allright, he just switch off everything. The switch off is very anxious because he is just a spectator, he is the only spectator of the whole spectacle and he can just switch off the whole spectacle if he does not like it.

So the mother has to play a very beautiful role, very carefully she has to nourish her children, she has to look after them, she has to bring them up, and should be then entering into the Kingdom of God. Then only you can enter into the Kingdom of God and that is a thing of great patience, love and tremendous power. If you don’t have power, say if this Mother Earth did not have power, she could not have born us, with all the kinds of horrible things going on, the way we are digging her, the way we are torturing her, she would have collapsed long time back. But she has such a tremendous power of forgiveness, of compassion, love and nourishment that she is activated, and your Kundalini is the same Mother Earth, she is the representation of the same Mother Earth, the same Holy ghost, of the same kumba, as you call it the Aquarius, that is the Aquarius, this is the Aquarian Age they call it because this is the Age when you will get your nourishment. Your own kundalini is going to nourish you, she is going to soothe you, she is going to guide you properly, the Mother is the greatest guru. I mean even the gurus have their mother. A guru has to be a mother otherwise how will they come and the whole absurdity has come to us also in the West from many religions especially we should say Christianity and Judaism, where they did not talk of the Mother at all, that was the time to talk, because at the time of Abraham, they had to talk of the Father, then at the time of Christ they had to talk of the Son, that was the time because if he had talked about his own mother’s stay they would have killed her and then he would have come out with his eleven destroying powers, he would have finished the whole show once for all. So he never talked about the Mother power.

Now the time has come for the Mother power and I was told that 13, in the 13th century somebody “What was his name?” “Joachim de Fiore”  he talked about this, that, because I don’t read books you see, he talked that it was the time of the Father, then the manifestation of the Son, and the manifestation of the Mother is awaiting.  And when this manifestation takes place, as a result of that only, you get your Self-realization. But those people who want to take advantage, only talk of the doomsday, they don’t talk of the resurrection day. Now if you read Koran, any one of you who has read Koran, I deliberately tried to understand it, because my father translated it into Hindi language, that it mostly describes the resurrection times and very little of the doomstimes but the doom is described more because they want to frighten everybody, “the doomsday is coming, better get converted, you see doomsday is coming,” just to frighten people and in that, he has very clearly said that at the time of resurrection your hands will speak, they have all talked of the future, Christ has talked about the future that he’ll send you a comforter, and he’ll send you the Holy Ghost, he has talked about it, everyone of them has talked about.

Fourteen thousand years back in India, a great astrologer, he is we should say the father of astrology, he is the originator of astrology, Brugumuni has written a book Nadi Granth, in which he has clearly said that this age will come when the Mother, the Parabrahma, the Mother, Parabrahma is the Adi Shakti, we call it Primordial mother’s power, will come and in 1970 this will start as Sahaja the Kundalini will rise and there will be no need for hospitals and all that. If it works out, we can avoid the third world war he’s clearly said fourteen thousand years back. And if it is not working, then there will be a problem, most of the people will be destroyed and then only the yogis will take over. Means these yogis are sahaja yogis. This is very clearly said in that, so it was already been prophecized so many years back for us. And William Blake has prophecized that men of God will become prophets and then have power to make others prophets. The amount of details William Blake has written I don’t think even Markandeya has done that, he of course Markandeya has described even the shape of my knees and all that, but this one has described even the exact house where I live, all the house, and even the ashram where we are going to live, imagine, to that extent this William Blake has written. So you can understand how far he has gone deep into the whole thing and he was such a great seer born in England which is the heart of the universe.

So now as they must have told you that this is the Visshuddhi chakra of the universe. Did you tell them that? Not yet. Allright so I leave it to them to tell you. And what are the responsibilities, I mean the responsibility lies here and how the Americans have responsibility. I mean you are very noble people throughout your talk of such noble things and I believe in you, believed in it and you always fought for the noble side of life.   But now if one by one if you start destroying yourself from within, the whole thing can fritter out. So we have no right to destroy ourselves because we cannot create even a hair. We have no business to say, what is wrong? Whatever is wrong against life, whatever is anti-life is anti-God. God has created you, you have not created it yourself, so don’t take up responsibility to ruine yourself. Only thing what you can do is to cure yourself,  you have to soothe yourself, respect yourself even when you do something, know that, Are you doing out of respect for yourself or you are just doing because our ego is saying, What’s wrong? like these punk rocks you see, going on with that kind of absurd things on the road, like a clown they are moving making themselves such a nuisance while it (?).    And in England it is very common to see these people but when they come to me after that I find their eyes are becoming blind. And it’s become a great strain for me to clear that because these dyes you see, they make your eyes, these horrible dyes make your optic globe so heavy that your eyes become blind. These things have very serious effects.     You must know that and you must learn all about it, how this affects you.

Also you must learn as Sahaja yogis, how to talk to others. First of all, among the Sahaja yogis you are all one. You are part and parcel of the whole which is awakened in you, all should keep together as one and gradually you will understand how beautiful you all are because you are all saints, respect each other, you are saints, how can you insult anyone who are saints. So first of all give up those bad habits of talking and barking at others, try to love each other, respect each other, be very very kind to each other and if possible try to express it through some material gifts or through some material help in the sense not that you give money or all that, but we (?) some little presents sometimes or we can just try to look after the comfort of the other person, put our attention to them, how you could be nice to them. There is no need to be slavish, there is no need to be pampering their ego but know that as I am the saint, he is the saint. If you see the real saints when they meet, they meet in such a big way, you see that as if the two hands are rising, the five fingers are rising all unison, in concord.  Imagine one hand is going like this, another like this you can’t do any work. So you belong to one collective being, and all of you should understand and establish complete concord among yourselves.

As far as the others are concerned, there are others, so when they are the others, then you have to talk to them very sweetly, quietly, gradually opening the truth about Sahaja Yoga because Sahaja Yoga is a very great truth and not easy to (guessing?) it, not easy it is a very great thing, it is impossible especially for ego-oriented people because they have like a snake all the time beyond sitting and just refuses to see things you see, and that is how it is very difficult, so gradually open out one by one every thing. Unless and until you find them allright, don’t tell them because they’ll shun up. Of course it does not matter, they are the losers, but as we have to be compassionate towards them, we have to save them, we have to be careful not to tell them. Like a person’s getting drowned and you are a swimmer so you tell that person, “keep quiet, don’t pull your hands, be careful”. Sometimes they might answer, “Why not I am also going to do it”. So if they do it they’ll fall, so then you have to tell down, “If you do like that you are going to fall out” and you just release your hands for a while and let them see for themselves and then they’ll know “oh God, I am going down”, so they’ll come down. So to give them a lesson also a little bit is important, but in such a gentle way that they understand that if you have to go ahead you have to learn about it gradually, calmly, and do not blast them suddenly, if you blast them, then they will be all shattered, you see, they are already in pieces, the whole world is in a big turmoil, in a big tension and whatever we have to do, we have to do it with great care, and love, and affection, and understanding.

So with others you have to be gurus and to understand not like the other gurus are and the real gurus are just the opposite of these gurus who are taking money from you. I mean better keep off from the real ones because they can hit you very hard. I know of someone, you see once it happened that he told me that Mother if somebody troubles you, you better send him over to me, I said allright. I did not know he was such a harsh man and this gentleman was troubling me too much. I said “allright you go and see that guru once”   he was so elated because this guru does not see people normally, so he went all the way, he climbed on the mountains, reached him, you see, and he started talking about me “Oh Mother has become so generous she gives us (unclear), she should not do this, it is not proper, she is cheapening Sahaja Yoga in all these years”. He said “Really you think so, you are higher than that, isn’t it, and then he made him sleep there and then next time I see him was when he came with both the legs broken and put around his neck and dandling like that you see, in the hall. I was sitting and tears started rolling in my eyes, I said “What is this, who has done this to you?” he said “The guru has done this” I said “how?” he said “I was sleeping and..” this guru has, his hands and feet are broken by people, so he uses a tiger to move about, “so the tiger came and he threw me in a cot and I fell down and it was about twelve – fifteen feet down. I fell down and I broke my both the sides here and then this guru after three days, you see, I called and called nobody came and then after three days he put some chapatis” as you call like your pitta bread down saying that “Eat that now”. I was there, I was urinating, doing everything there, in that filth I was there. After 5 days he picked me up, when I went up he said “How dare you talk about Mother? now you put this feet legs around your neck and go to her dandling like this and she will cure you, not me, so go and tell her all about it”. I said “What are you doing one way around such guru why should you do like that?”. Another fellow doctor I sent him who had gone very much wrong, so he made him carry two buckets of water all the way to the mountain and clean one Shiva temple which is all neglected you see. Poor fellow when he came, he was thin, just bones I asked “What happened Doctor?” He said “You see I was told these exercise for a month”. So when I met him, I asked him “What do you mean by treating them like this, it was too much” and he said “they are donkeys and donkeys must be treated like donkeys. That is my principle. You go ahead, you want to convert donkeys into good men, allright you try it, but I am not going to do that”. He told me very frankly.

So the real gurus don’t take any money but they really take you to task so. And anybody who takes money, be sure that he is not a guru at all, by anything you cannot take any money from the people. Now supposing if they have to pay, say these people want to pay some sort of an ashram, all right go ahead I have nothing to do, I don’t want to see accounts or anything, you do among yourselves. I have nothing to do and everyone should know how the money is spent, where they have spent it, how it has happened. Everyone should know but I don’t want to have the money because I don’t understand money. So better not have it then.

So this is what an attitude should be for you people also that in money matters also we should be very straight forward.

Now the point that I want to tell you is that as Daniel has told me that people in Santa Cruz don’t have the sustainance to stay in Sahaja Yoga this is very surprising that they don’t have sustainance but to me Americans seem to be guru shopping all the time, you see they go here here here here all over and this is a temple where you are entering, you settle down. If you go on digging everywhere for the well, what do you get, nothing. So wherever you get little water go and dig in more then even if you get little bit you go on digging it more and more and that is how you’ll settle down as real sahaja yogis. So as you know that, Sahaja Yoga is not a thing that we have any organization as such, or we have any granting of diplomas, degrees, or courses, nothing like that. It is some they can go just like that, some people go so fast, surprising, and some people are so slow, that I don’t know what category I should put them, they can’t go, you see, like we used to read in our mathematics before a man came for five days worked ran away and then another man came who worked for two days ran away, all of them are runaways you see, so if that type of people are there in Sahaja Yoga nothing will work out you see, this work nor any answer to that mathematic will never be done, you see.

That is what it is so for you people it is important to know that you have to sustain yourself in Sahaja Yoga. It is very important  because there is a drag, first it is a material drag, matter always drags you, comfort, this, that, whatever you may say that you are a non materialistic, it will drag you down; and that another thing like intellectuals feats that you have gone through and the mental conception, you must see the truth and accept it. Don’t accept anything even when I am telling you because it is not proper. You must have a open attitude but you’ll find gradually that if you find about nine points true then you must believe in 100 points because it is so, and go ahead with it. This is what belief means, it does not mean that we should believe that now you have become like primordial masters. That is a wrong attitude so I would say that gradually you are all going to grow into great people, you have before you some people sitting here who have grown like that and some people have grown suddenly like that, I would say some of them were following so many other things, then they dropped it in a second, they dropped it in such a quick understanding but some are very slow people and Sahaja Yoga has a double type of a force, one is centripetal and the other is centrifugal and through that another type of a thing you go round and just you are thrown out at the tangent.

So be careful, try to remain in Sahaja Yoga and it is within yourself that you have to remain, Sahaja Yoga is all within yourself. So try to remain within yourself and follow the methods of Sahaja Yoga which are actually the true, what we call the Shudda Vidya, is the pure knowledge, the pure knowledge, how to handle your powers, how to cure your chakras, how to nourish yourself, and how to reach the state where you just become joy, all those things you have to understand and do it for yourself and you have to do it for others also in the same way, but if you are not established you yourself are still lingering with other things, then this transformation is not established then people are not going to believe. Like an egg you were, now you become like a bird but the bird has to come out of the shell completely, has to be a clean bird, has to know how to fly out properly, then only you’ll be called as really transformed bird because bird in Sanskrit language is called “bija”, means twice born, and that happens to human beings also that, that’s why on a Christmas day we give eggs because we are eggs and with Christ resurrection we have to become the bird. And that is why we have to learn, so many things you will know which you have not known before, all the symbols, all the things that we have known from outside, you will know from inside and the whole thing will be integrated, completely integrated.

I hope I have one more chance to see you again and meet you again. But in any case I would like to have questions from you if possible but there is no need for sahaja yogis to be aggressive with me. But be careful about murmuring souls as Christ has said, you see there are some people who are half-baked, they play into the hands of negativity and they go on murmuring at the back you see, they won’t allow you to progress. We have someone, some people even now after ten years, they continue slowly slyly working out at the back range you see, and try murmuring and put you down. So you go according to your own understanding and don’t according to the other understanding but gradually you’ll find you’ll come to the open space of complete reality.

May God bless you.

I would like to have questions.

(Someone asks a question, then everybody in the room settles down closer to Shri Mataji)

Very good you have said the right thing at the right time which I wanted to tell you about. Very much. Have you got the chart? (Yes it is here, Mother). Now you see the chart that is here. Can you remove this one a little bit. Now the whole thing is that the naïveness of the Western people has been exploited by the people who wanted to really take advantage of you. Now how they discovered the naïveness you see, the naïveness that you are very naïve at things. Most is that so many people, even you, now you are realized souls no doubt but you, even you were misled there. Of course Freud was very much misled and so many of them. And when they read their books, they said this is the chance. So when I saw one of the, as I said I don’t read much but I had to talk to Jungians so I saw there some of their diagrams and I was shocked, you see, because what was there was they showed the human being as such, the unconscious first, a layer, then the unconscious that will manifest, then the subconscious, then the conscious mind on top of the ego. Such a jumble box, I tell you really, and this must have given a key to this people to come down here. That means that if you have to go, see how it is, layer by layer, they have put in, it is a self–conviction I tell you, so if you have to go to unconscious down below, as it is said, then you have to go to subconscious. So when they knew that this people are willing to go to the subconscious, they came here and they started to talk about it.

Now actually it is not like this, they are not placed one on top of another. They are vertically placed, that is a clear part here. You see it, God is the greatest organizer . See now if I have to come inside, you won’t keep all the people there, and all these things there for me to cross through it, will you. I mean you’ll organize in a way that there should be movement. Isn’t it. Even in an airport if you go you won’t put all the (unclear) thing between where all other people have to pass through. I mean, He is a great organizer so he organized it this way, beautifully done that the path in the center is kept open for you to ascend ultimately. Allright?

Now the subconscious is on the left hand side, the supraconscious the future side is on the right hand side, so you don’t have to go to these places. Those people who take LSD or all that go to the right side, those people who go to these some of gurus, I mean some gurus are also right-sided like Hitler used that supraconscious he used that from lamas, he got it from lamas, so what happens that when without realization you try to push your attention to the left or the right you go into these things where you get caught up into the collective subconscious on the left and the collective supraconscious on the right and you start getting all these nonsense. And by that, you can be anything, I mean, see people in the left side can suffer from all these diseases, see all your incurable diseases like cancer, aids, myolitis, all these diseases, they come from left side entry. If you go, even doctors have accepted, doctors have accepted, because I saw there one film where they said that the triggering, first of all they say it has to be vulnerable, means too much of sympathetic activities. Supposing you have this chakra here like this and this is the vertebra left and right.  Now if there is too much sympathetic means left or right activity, then it opens out and the connection with the whole is lost you see, now what happens you start moving towards the left, once you start moving towards the left, you enter into the subconscious area and there you enter into the collective subconscious where you are catching from other people, collective subconscious, it is not consciousness but subconscious you are touching there, you see.

Now for example I’ll tell you  a simple thing like flirting is also the same thing, you’ll be amazed, flirting is, we can’t flirt I mean we can’t, our eyes are too simple to flirt you know, there is nothing inside to flirt with, it is a joyless pursuit but this, what happens that is the spirit you see that guides the flirting. And I was amazed when somebody told me this I said why is this, but I saw people getting the spirits from one eye to another but I don’t know how it works out but once somebody told me, he was standing with me, on the platform and suddenly he turned round, he said, see there is a woman standing there. And I said, but you never saw her, but her spirit collectively as you said behind, behind the gentleman, so he caught it, collectively you see suggested. And this spirit informs that spirit and the thing worked out, and it turned round.  See because eyes are not innocent, the eyes have the spirits in them, you see, there is lust and greed, and if you have lust and greed in your eyes, then these spirits come to help you down, they also enjoy their lust and greed through your eyes or through your behavior, so then you are (unclear, Shri Mataji talks away from the microphone : there … things of the body is of troubles sometimes) because the doctors said that when it is vulnerable for cancer, means there is too much right and left side activity, then triggering takes place by the attack from the area that is built within us since our creation and they call it, the attacks are called as protein 52 and protein 58, just imagine, they give them the name 52 and 58, but I told them these are nothing but spirits. Why these infections? is nothing but the dead vegetables and animals which are born out of circulation of you know of your evolution. Whatever goes out of circulation goes in certain stand there, and whatever is in the future a futuristic man who lives in future, most of the western people live in future, they go to the supraconscious area.

I mean there are cases like somebody started suddenly painting like Gauguin, I know Gauguin, he is a great painter he did the same strong lines, the colors  and things and he has some very beautiful painting like he has done a sunflower beautifully, yellow is his favorite color, and one tape just in front of everyone on the television you could see it, and he said I am possessed by Gauguin. And Gauguin started talking “yea I have possessed you” because he was mad, he died he possessed him but it was for a short time, and then Gauguin went away, it is perhaps maybe that I gave it a bandhan perhaps maybe. But that is what it is.

So you see, whatever is happening into you is not siddhis. Siddhi is this when you become “siddha”, means proved to be a realized soul. These are called shuddras, “shuddra” in english means what? .. what? untouchable, shuddra untouchable, it should not be touched, one should not touch them, this is very low and that is what people think to be advancement like people start jumping you know these Mahesh yogis people when they came to me, they were jumping on the first seat, I said now what is happening here? They said, Now we are flying in the air.  I said, Where? you are just jumping there like frogs you see. Where is the air. And put your guru to fly, let us see if he can fly. Why not ask them to fly? You see you should find out also the life of guru, how he is. Like the one who is supposed to be here, Bagwan he calls himself God. He cannot smell a flower, I mean imagine there are at least, if there are a thousand names of God, there are at least 30 names which say you are so fond of this flower, you are so fond of that flower, I mean if he cannot smell flower, then how can he be God, I mean flower is the most beautiful thing in the creation, isn’t it? And he cannot smell flowers, such a man should be something, put him in some filthy place then he will be happy there I think. That is what it is. You must understand if he does not like the fragrance of the flower, how can it be?

And all of them are so gross, I tell you. They do not know any sophistication of life, nothing. The aesthetics, if you see the way they live, it is horrible, if you see the carpets they use, the amount of things they have, it is all nonsensical, see that even they are not rustic there, I don’t know what to call them, they are very cheap type of people, very cheap, they can’t talk to you about your philosophies, your music, they don’t know about Indian music, leave any other music. They don’t know about Indian dancing, they don’t know about Indian traditions. Ask them why this is put, or why this is what, why this is what, they won’t be able to tell you.

What are they talking about Brahma and this and that? read some few books here and there and just started talking, some of them have come direct from jail. But they are so confusing, I can understand they can confuse you because they talk another language, which you have never heard before, but it is like going from 5 to 5, this day, you see, it is not proper. You must understand that something must happen to you of which you should be the master. Simple. Supposing I’ll say I am such and such. Allright, so what? What did I give you? What did you get?  I am not surprised my child that you’ve got these things. I have seen people who have ended up into complete recluses, absolutely horrible things have happened to them. But if you tell them also, they don’t want to hear. It is such a possession, they say let us go to hell, does not matter, our guru will go to hell, we’ll go with him. Really. They are so identified, I mean you can’t tell them. You just can’t talk to them, if you talk to them, they feel very hurt, they don’t know what harm it has done to them, they just don’t know.

Question from the public : Should we have compassion for such teachers and such people that are affiliated with them.

Shri Mataji: First of all you develop your compassion, secondly discretion. You see it is a wasted compassion. What is the use of having compassion for Hitler? It is wasted, absolutely wasted. I have been to most of them, talked to them, told them, What are you doing? You’ve come out of the hell, now you are again going to go back permanently there. They won’t listen to me. It is wasted.

Question:What about the people that are associated with them, she said.

Shri Mataji: Associated ?

Question: The disciples?

Shri Mataji : Try but very difficult you know. Very difficult. Like one of the persons we had John in London who was very much, you see, worried about his friend who was really lost to this fellow, this fourteen year old fellow. And he talked to him about it and they were driving in a car, and he just went havock like this, like that, and he had to jump out of the car, you see, the fellow they could not bear it. Yogi had compassion for three people from Rajnesh, you see. I told him, You bring them alone separately to me, not in the big crowd; because in India we have really very big crowds you see. Now I said, There will be problem; but he had compassion, you see, I told him, Just don’t bring here; but you see that time he did not understand what I was saying, but they brought them and they must be about 60 feet away from me, not very close, as soon as they stood up and saw me, they just collapsed, you see, no energy in their body. People tried to lift them, their hands would slip just like a fish. You see they didn’t know what to do, five – six people had to litterally lift that type of a molasses, you see, from there and put them out. It was such a problem. So it is not easy but gradually if they discover it, come to right conclusion and they are still, something is there (Shri Mataji shows the brain) left, then you can manage.

Question: About TM meditation

Shri Mataji: Everybody does till you discover. I must tell you about TM horrid things about that. What happens actually.

Question: the lady says she comes from TM, her husband is still in in, can she help him out.

Shri Mataji: You can manage it, I’ll tell you. He formed a big organization in Scotland. There is a lake called Ronoch lake. And there was a gentleman who was a diamond merchant. You see and his wife was the grand-daughter of a duke of England. She always tried, you see, to find all the rich people of the world and he said you start this organization there and it was called as the Academy of Flying. The Academy of Flying. You see they used to pay six thousand pounds to go and do these things. They were, this girl was with him for eighteen years and they married about, I think, twelve years or so. And then this gentleman has been for twelve years. And this lady got a horrible type of epilepsy which I have never seen. For three hours she used to go into that thing and used to shout and neck used to be pulled on and “ahahar” and from the mouth you see all funny types of things used to fall out, she used to vomit, a terrible condition, nobody could control it, nobody could do anything. The daughter also got it, the husband got it, all of them got it, and the deputy director who also had inherited a lot of money from his mother also got it. All of them, four of them got it. So one of their friends, you see they all started wondering what’s happening to this people and they had become bankrupt because the money was not paid to them at all after three four years. They were spending all the money and they said yes we are going to send you accounts and this and that, and money was quite finished.

So what happened, some people who knew them, who were under them, who worked under them, I mean, in the sense that they went and so called they learnt the siddha movements and all that, you see one of them had gone to a barber shop and they are not allowed to read anything you see, it is such a maffia stuff. There was one book kept as Yoga Today, and an article by David Baxter, and he somehow he felt like reading and in that my photograph was there and David had said, “You can put your hands on this and see for yourself if you have got realization or not”. And when he put it, he went into contorsions, he had such a fright you see, he closed the book you see, and he telephoned. We have a very simple man called Douglas who was on the phone and he said “have you been to TM” he said, “yes”; he said “are you boiling”, he said, “I am perspiring”; he said “allright come and see us”. So he went there. And I was in the house, you see,  eating my food, suddenly a SOS came from the ashram, “Mother somebody has come called David Frawl you see and we just told him your name and he’s going into contorsions he cannot stop it. Better come here it is just an SOS”. I said “let him go into contorsions for a while and work it out”. Then I gave a bandhan and all that and then when he went back he saw that it was stopped. Then this David Frawl you see called these people, they came, they were so frightened of this Mahesh yogi they came to see me in a very far fetched place, you see, somewhere outside London and there they told me that this is all that has happened to them and all that. They had no money even to come to that. I brought them in my car, they stayed in my house, imagine, these rich people lost everything and then I cured all of them.

Now they are allright but the husband became such a bankrupt he had to go away to South Africa, his wife was so frightened and all that she is cured now, she is with the yogi there now she is a normal person. Still she gets lots of problems. And then, she told me that this man had raped her when she was seventeen years of age. This is when she was thirty five this has happened. And she had conceived a child from him and then she had an abortion and since then she is under trance, absolutely under his control even when she came to me she used to go into trance, “I love him, I love him”, this old gentle fellow you see, four feet two inches, I don’t know what made her love him. And he is very romantic, all that she used to say all those things really, but what happened before coming to me she went to News of the world and she had told them that “I want to give this about Mahesh yogi”. Everything she told and it was all published, everything was done, and then she came to me. I told her “you should not have told this, this is a stigma for your children”, but she said “Mother, I have done it, they’ll sue me for this” and all that, I said allright go ahead. And nobody bothered. So many people have written about TM but they go to it again and again, I don’t know how to bring them round. He is a very powerful force that way because he really somehow or another traps people. And his main organizer, I know him very well he is a very capable man and a big man in the government of India and I know him because after all my husband was also in the government and he told me that Maheshyogi says that unless and until you involve them through money, these Americans can never be put round. And to such an extent he thinks that they have a right to extract money from you people.
