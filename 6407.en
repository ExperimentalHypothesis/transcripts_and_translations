Public Program. Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), 12 March 1995.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very outset I have to tell you that truth is what it is. You cannot change it, you cannot transform it and unfortunately, at this human awareness, you cannot know it. In the evolutionary process you have come to a state of human awareness. But at this point you do not know the absolute truth. If you had known the absolute truth there would have been no quarrels, no fights, no wars, because everybody would have known it.

Now whatever I'm going to tell you here today please do not take for granted. We've had enough problems with blind faiths. So whatever I'm telling you, you should have an open mind like a scientist and treat it, my lecture as a hypothesis. If it proves then you have to accept it as honest people. Because it is for your benevolence, it is for the benevolence of your family, it is for the benevolence of your cities, benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world.

We have to understand that we have problems because we try to rationalize everything with our mental capacity. Everybody has a different style of rationalizing but if you can go somehow beyond this mind then you can see the reality. 

You have been told about this instrument that is within you, is all created during our creation. One by one we went through it during our evolutionary process. It's beautifully done and there is a power has been shown there which all of you have whether you're Hindu, Muslim, Christian, anybody. This is the power which has to give you your second birth.

So what is the truth? The first truth is that you're not this body, this mind, this intelligence, emotions, your ego or your conditionings. But you are the pure Spirit, you are beyond this. So you have to become the Spirit.

Another truth is when we see these flowers so beautiful, very beautiful they are, then, we do not think even that it's a miracle to have these different flowers with different colors, hues and different fragrance. Who does this work? Who runs your heart? If you ask a doctor he will say it is autonomous nervous system. But who is this "auto"? That is the Self, that is the Spirit. When we talk like "My hand," "My body," "My head," "My emotions," "My intellect," but who is the owner of this "My"? Is your Spirit.

There is such a seeking in modern times. I'm really surprised, because all these modern lifestyle has given us a kind of illusions. We live with illusions and once we discover these illusions we get very frustrated. In Sanskrit it is called as Brandhi. It's not only that Indian saints have talked about this. Also Tao, Tao of Lao Tze. Chinese know about it but they just don't know what to do. For Japanese there was Zen who has also said the same thing. I'm not saying something new to you. 

This work of giving awakening to this Kundalini was just like a seed, you put it in the Mother Earth, it sprouts. How? Because the seed has built-in capacity to sprout and the Mother Earth also has built-in capacity to sprout. So it is spontaneous. Sahaj means born with you. Saha is with, Ja is born. Also it means simple. It's born with you, spontaneous happening that should take place, is your birth-right as seekers. Of course you cannot force on people. You have to have a desire to get this higher awareness. 

This Kundalini is your Mother. She is your individual mother and She knows everything about you, about your past, about your aspirations, everything She knows. Like a tape-recorder She has taped your life, of many lives are there. And She's anxious to give you your second birth, very anxious. And now when you are seeking the truth, She works it, spontaneously. It's a living process, like we put the seed in the Mother Earth and it works. We don't pay any money to the Mother Earth for that, do we? So first thing we should know you cannot pay for this. It's your birth-right to get it and you will get it tonight.

So I have to tell you also about people who have commercialised because they know there are people who are seeking. They're commercialised and they're trying all kinds of tricks which is absolutely absurd. As a Mother I have to tell you the truth. For example, I went to Chicago and there was the head of the Hare Rama. He was wearing a dhoti in that cold, severe cold and he had shaved his head. I asked him, "Why are you wearing dhoti in this cold, what is the need?" He said, "My guru has told me if you wear a dhoti you'll get your Nirvana." I said, "Really?" In our country, India, at least eighty percent people wear dhotis. If they get Nirvana then where will you be? Then I said, "Why have you shaved your head?" So he said, "I've shaved it because again my guru has said you have to shave if you have to take Nirvana." On this, Kabira, a great poet has said that by shaving your head if you can go to heaven what about the sheep which is shaved every year twice? All such things, you see, "You go to Himalayas, you stand on one foot," or die there. They started also something called Shambala that you go in the Gobi Desert and you get Nirvana. In any case if you go in the desert you'll die, what is there? Then there are people who are now saying that you can fly at three feet height, imagine. What is the need to fly at three feet high, I can't understand. As it is, in this Kuala Lumpur, there're so many cars that it's very difficult to go even for a small distance, you know, and if you have these people going about at three feet, what would happen? There is another one who gives diamonds, this that, now he's exposed, thank God, because he used to mesmerise people. Another one is now teaching people how to move pendulum and he's made lots of money. I was in Washington, they came and said, "We have lost Mother, all our money, what to do." I said, "For what? For this moving pendulum? Have you come on this earth to move pendulum? Is that the value of your life that you lost all your money, everything?" So here the seekers are earnest and they're trying to seek. Here there's a market of these people who are commercialising and we start following them because, I think they're stupid, that's all.

The greatest number of stupid people I've found in America. They're really idiotic. They take to all kinds of nonsence, and they accept it. They're supposed to be very developed. I think they have no wisdom at all, and then they come to Me crying, "Mother, this has happened." I said, "But why did you do it?"

So one has to understand that something has to happen to your awareness. It's not just, "I believe in this, I believe in that." No. You have to believe in yourself and you have to know everything about yourself. This is very important that we should understand our own value. Otherwise anybody can exploit you. Because now you have money, you've cars. They see this, they want all that. So money has nothing to do with spirituality, God doesn't understand money. He doesn't understand banking and all that. See that is your headache. You have created money. 

All right, so now when this Kundalini rises, what happens? First thing is that She nourishes all these centres. And these subtle centres are for your physical, mental, emotional and Spiritual being. Complete benevolence. But when they go into jeopardy then you create problems. It helps physically very much.

In India there are four doctors from university who have done their MBBS, have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga, MD in Sahaja Yoga, for curing some incurable diseases. But people get cured just like that and I was amazed that in Russia people are sixty-five percent extremely spiritual. They're not materialistic, they don't want material things, they're not. Their government said, "All right you take your flats and look after them, you take your houses, look after them." They said, "No no, we don't want, you better look after them, why should possess a headache." Sixty-five percent. And they understand spirituality very well, very well.

All the developing countries like India and others are, we're now trying to make money. All right, not that you should not make but also you must have a balance. You must know the bad effects of money. See America is what? Sixty-five percent people they say will become schizophrenic, means half-mad. In India we don't have half-mads. We either have full or no. But in America you have. They're all right, suddenly they become mad. The again they're all right, suddenly they become mad. All funny diseases. Then they have AIDS and all sorts of diseases they have.

So one has to understand that this kind of progress, imbalanced, has not brought any happiness to people. There are more diseases now than they were ever before. So it is important for us to see. Supposing somebody goes and falls into a ditch. So we should see, he's fallen into ditch now, what should we do, how to protect ourselves. So with this happening, physical being gets completely corrected. Many incurable diseases, blood cancer, all kinds of diseases are cured with this. But in getting cured you also get other things that is complete mental peace you get. Many mental cases have been cured, many mental cases. Some of them were also people, children who were suffering from, handicapped and also some were mentally handicapped. All these could be cured, not that all will be cured but all these problems can be cured in a person. With your own power you are the doctor, you're not to pay for it, it's your own power that will cure. People don't believe it because they have no faith in themselves but it'a a fact I'm telling you that it works.

Now when this Kundalini rises what another thing She does is that She gives you complete peace of mind. How it happens like you're standing in the water, you're afraid that you'll be drowned with the waves. But supposing if you get into the boat then you don't mind looking at those waves and enjoying them. But supposing you know how to swim then you can just jump down and save people. This is exactly what happens in Sahaja Yoga. 

We are all the time thinking about the future and the past. We cannot be in the present. So we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts which rise fall, rise fall, rise fall, we're jumping like that. In between them there's a little space, a pause where there is peace, when you are in the present. Future is over, it doesn't exist and past we don't know. But we are all the time jumping with these thoughts. So when the Kundalini rises She elongates these thoughts, elongates. And by elongating these thoughts, She creates peace. And we become absolutely peaceful. Then we become the witness; the whole thing looks like a drama. You are out of your problems so you can solve them. And with this peace you become very dynamic but very peaceful. At my age as you know, all of you, seventy-two years of age, I'm travelling everyday, practically third day, fourth day I'm out. But I'm peaceful, I never think I'm travelling; I think if I am sitting here on a sofa, there also I'm sitting. 

So this thinking stops and you become thoughtlessly aware. In Sanskrit it's called as Nirvichar Samadhi, where there is no thought but you are absolutely aware, very aware. Your memory improves, if you see something, I'm seeing these flowers, now it's all in within Me, the joy that is within these flowers starts trickling down. Now supposing this carpet is beautiful, I look at this carpet, thank God it's not mine otherwise I would have had a headache, to insure it, to worry about it, this that. So I look at it and the joy that is put inside this by the artist in a subtle way starts pouring down Me, I become absolutely filled with joy of this creation. So you become thoughtlessly aware and then the real inspirations come to you. And you're dynamic at the same time. Your attention now becomes enlightened by the Spirit. If the attention is enlightened then what happens? This attention works. Sitting down here you can find out about anyone you want to. On your central nervous system you can feel it, the centre of that person, you know the chakras which are catching and you know what's wrong with that person, what's going to happen.

If you know how to correct yourself, your own chakras, you can correct the chakras of others. So then you also put them into proper shape and life becomes very beautiful. Your attitude towards life changes, towards your relationships, towards your society and then you start understanding what wrong we have been doing. It's like this. Supposing I have a snake in my hand. It's all darkness here and I'm very obstinate and you tell me that you have a snake in your hand. I will say, "No, it is not, it is a rope." Till the snake bites me I'll be holding on to it. But supposing there is little light, immediately I'll throw away. In the same way you give up all destructive habits. Overnight people have given up drugs, very surprising. Because you have the light and this light makes you wise. You get your wisdom. Then also we go to one extreme, to another extreme. Like you can see the Western culture is such that there's abandonment. You don't have to worry about anything, go ahead, live like a very licentious, permissive person, is allowed. It's freedom.

The other ones are, other religions are very strict. "You can't do this, you can't do this," this and that. These are two extremes. But with this you come in balance. You actually become religious. You become righteous. You don't do wrong things, you just don't do it, because there is light. This is enlightenment. You know about saints, how they lived. They were married, they had children. But what was their life? That's what exactly happens to you, that you become extremely wise and enlightened.

It is that on your central nervous system, when this Kundalini rises and pierces through, She connects you to the main. Like this instrument had to be connected to the mains, otherwise it had no meaning, no identity. In the same way you get connected to that all-pervading vital power. And then you start feeling the vibrations on your hand, of like a cool breeze. When it happens to you, you can ask any question. Like a computer, you ask any question, the answer comes to you, on your finger tips. So to know the truth on your central nervous system. Like we are human beings, all right. We know so many things. But say, there's a dog or a horse if you want to take him through a dirty lane, he'll go away, he won't think about it. But we can't go because our awareness is much higher. But with this we don't do anything wrong, just don't do it, because our awareness becomes much higher.

Then comes that in this enlightenment you see everything on your finger tips. You know everything on your central nervous system. This is what has to happen which is called as in Sanskrit, Bodh. Bodh, or wave from where, vida, means from where the wave word has come, and from Bodh, Buddha has come. So it not just a mental idea, it is not just somebody's thoughts that you are carrying. No, it is something that happens to you, actually that you can feel it on your central nervous system. This is what is Sahaj Yoga, means spontaneous union with the divine power. Now this divine power of love is, for your information, so this divine power is the ocean of knowledge, of absolute knowledge. It's the ocean of compassion and love. It is the ocean of miracles. Not this kind of gifting a diamond and all that. But so many miracles take place which are very different and people are writing books, on this I said, "Don't write to me, you can write it yourself," because so many things small and big they tell us. So in short you enter into the kingdom of God. 

Now this kingdom of God is very efficient, very alert. And how it helps you, you'll be surprised in every day to day work, in your business, in everything. And the attention is so alert that there are so many artists who have suddenly become well known. You must have heard of Amjad Ali, Safar Hussain Khan, so many in India, Debu Choudhury, all these were ordinary artistes, have suddenly become very great. In Australia we have some painters who are now world-famous. Because your attention becomes very clean and pure, no more confusions. Confusions of modern times just disappear. And you start creating beautiful art which is appreciated. It's not grotesque, vulgar, but people appreciate and you get a name for that. I've seen people who are doing ordinary business have become big business. But they're very humble. They don't take to bad things, otherwise normally you give somebody hundred dollars, immediately he'll go to the pub, immediately. But then such a person who is enlightened has to do every day to day mundane work, his attention is absolutely pure. 

Also, you'll be surprised in this attention your relationships with everybody improves. You can see a person have this. You don't have to give up your family, you don't have to give up anything. Also you don't have to fast for God, why should you fast? You can fast for your health but not for God. He's father, most loving father; He's Father of all the fathers and which father would like his son to fast because the son wants to meet Him? Absurd things. You fast and give all the money to the Brahmins or to the priests. It's all nonsense. There's nothing of this kind which is divine. Divine is love and love of a kind that makes you really enjoy a detached love. 

Now the detached love is like this, that like a sap in the tree rises. It goes to various places and gives nourishment to different things and ultimately it evaporates or it goes back to Mother Earth. It does not stick to something. Supposing it sticks to something like a fruit or a flower the whole tree will die and the fruit and flower will also die. So we get stuck, you see, "For my children, for my sons, for my this," this is what people do for corruption, what do they do. What's the use, whatever you have to do it, you should do it for everything. It is a category of people, very selfish, they just don't do for anybody else. Some think better will do for their relations, some think better will do for their communities. But in Sahaja Yoga we work for the global peace.

Another point which is very important to understand that we respect all the religions equally the same. All religions came on this earth as flowers of spirituality, all of them. But then people plucked it, "This is my religion, this is my religion," and now they're fighting with the dead religion. Why should you fight in the name of God? Simple question. All over the world they're fighting in the name of God, it's very shameful. But once you become one with the Divine, you become one living organism like that. 

We have seminars everywhere, even in India we have seminars, we get people from sixty-five nations and I've not seen anybody fighting or anybody saying even a bad word to somebody. Such respect, such love. It's a new world, it's a new age, it's a new race that has to come. Such help, if something happens to somebody in Kuala Lumpur the whole of the world will try to help. All the people will try to help. It's such a one understanding that we are part and parcel of the whole. Then who's the other? Everything belongs to you. It's a great feeling, you expand and you'll be amazed once you get your realization, once you become Sahaja Yogi all over the world you will find your brothers and sisters, all of them. You're not small, you're not just for your family, your house, no, but you must expand and this expansion comes when you have the light of the Spirit. You don't have to pay or you don't have to do anything, just to feel oneness, it's very beautiful.

Now the another quality of Spirit is that it is the source of absolute truth. If they put hands towards like that and ask questions, for anybody, immediately they know, immediately, what's wrong with that person. Say if you take ten children, tie up their eyes, they're realized souls, you ask them, "What's wrong with this person?" they will all show the same finger. Supposing they show this finger, means he's something wrong with his heart and you ask the person, "What's matter with your heart?" he'll say, "How do you know?" You don't have to go for diagnosis, you don't have to do anything. You can diagnose yourself and you can diagnose other people. It sounds very fantastic but we are fantastic. Like if you have a television and you take to a remotest corner of a jungle and tell people that you can see hear pictures and everything, ah, they'll say, "What, this is just a box, how can you see?" But once you put it to the mains it starts working and it is so fantastic that these ignorant people are all so amazed, how it is working. In the same way, it works. So we have to know our own value. We have to know what we are. The greatest thing that happens that we jump in the ocean of joy. Joy is not like happiness and unhappiness. If your ego is pampered you feel happy; if it is punctured you feel unhappy, it's not like that. Joy is a feeling which is unique and you are just joyous, in joy within yourself. You've come here to enjoy, not to weep and cry and beat yourself, no. Your wrong idea. God who has created us is a very sensible person, isn't He? Why will He create us to be unhappy? But we in our ignorance and stupidity try to make everyone unhappy.

So this is the time, special time, I call it the blossom time where there are many seekers and who get self-realization. I was really amazed, of course in India it's growing very fast, no doubt, but in Russia, we have to always take a stadium where at least eighteen thousand people could be seated and it is spreading so fast all over. It's like one light which is enlightened, enlightens another light. Now that light which is enlightened, enlightens another. 

I'm surprised to see so many Sahaja Yogis in this country because we started with two or three to begin with. And suddenly it has now become so big. You don't have to pay, you don't have to worry. You don't have to read also much about it. Because by reading also what people get conditioned, you know. Same Kabira has said by reading too much people have become stupid. I've met many like that. You talk to them, they'll tell you, "Did you read this book?" You read yourself, why do you want me to read all these books? It is spreading all over and it should spread here also and as it is, you are very great seekers, I know that and that you have come here all the way. I'm sure it will work out for you. But for that you must have self-confidence. You must have self-confidence, very important.

Another thing I confess I cannot force it on you because I respect your freedom, absolutely. It will take hardly fifteen minutes. But one thing, nobody should leave the hall when we are working it out. If they want they can go now but when people are working it out they should not disturb others.

Whether you sit away or near Me, you all will get your self-realization. It doesn't matter where you are sitting. The children can come in front, let the children come in front. If some people want to come in front, they can come also.

Now I have to tell you that there are three conditions which are very simple. One of them is that this all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness. So you have to forgive yourself. That means you should not feel guilty. On the contrary you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself . You might have done some mistakes in the past; forget the past. What's the use of harping on it now? But if you feel guilty then you catch on this centre here on the left hand side which is very dangerous. This gives you a disease called angina, a kind of a heart trouble. Also it gives you spondylitis. Also it can make your system of your organs very weak. Also you can get cervical cancer. It's a very dangerous thing. So why should we worry about the mistake we have committed, finished now. If you were really guilty, you would have been in jail, you would not have been here. So be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

Now the second condition is that we have to forgive everyone, without even thinking about them. Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But when you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and you torture yourself, while those who have troubled you are happy. But at this moment very important thing is the centre on the optic chiasma is like this, absolutely constricted, and if you don't forgive it won't open and how will the Kundalini pass through? So only thing you have to do is to forgive, by saying, it's a mantra, you can call it, that, "I forgive everyone in general." Don't even think about it because it's a headache.

Third one is very simple, is that you have to take out your shoes, because in England, first time when I told them, "Take out your shoes," half of them walked off. That's why I'm requesting you.

As you know there are two powers, left and right and the central path of ascent. So the left, left side and right side being two opposite powers, one for desire and one for action, we have to keep our both feet apart. Those who are sitting on the ground are all right. Those who are sitting on the chair please put your both the feet apart from each other, that's all.

Now when we'll close our eyes, when I tell you, you can take out your glasses, when I tell you, not just now, not just now. Just now I will ask somebody to show you. Anybody, you can come. To show you how we will be nourishing, you will be nourishing your own centres.

So the first, we put the left hand on our left side lap, very comfortably. You'll get it very comfortably, I told you you don't go to Himalayas or anything, here you will get it. So now put your left hand on your left lap, comfortably. This symbolises one thing, that you're desirous of getting self-realization, Atma Sakshatkar. This is to express your desire. Now Kundalini is the pure desire while other desires are not pure. Because today we want to have, say, a house, then you want to have a car, then you want to have a helicopter, and it goes on and on, we're never satisfied. It's a, it's a economic law that in general wants are not satiable, that means they're not pure, that's why. This is the pure desire. You may be aware or not, but it is the desire to be one with this divine power.

So you put your left hand which is meant for the mundane desire, left side is mundane desire, by which you should desire to have your self-realization. And with the right hand we'll be nourishing our centres, on the left hand side. So we put our right hand on our heart. In the heart resides your Spirit; it's the reflection of God Almighty, while Kundalini is the reflection of the primordial feminine power. So you put your right hand on your heart where resides the Spirit. Now if you become the Spirit then in the light of the Spirit you guide yourself, you become your own master. So we take down our hand, in the upper portion of our abdomen, on the left hand side which is the centre of your mastery. Surprisingly, the centre of pure divine knowledge is in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. So then we raise our right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen. Then on your heart. Then in the corner of neck and shoulder and turn our head to your right. This is the centre which is in jeopardy when you feel guilty. Now, please take your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head, as far as possible. This is the centre where you have to forgive everyone, please put down your heads, forgive everyone. Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Here you have to ask forgiveness, for your own satisfaction, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes from all-pervading divine power. Now, please stretch your palm fully, like this. Now put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area, the taloo, , which was a soft bone in your childhood. Through this bone, Kundalini emerges out. Now please put down your head as far as possible. Now important thing is to press back your fingers nicely so there's a good pressure on your scalp. Now please move your scalp seven times clockwise slowly. Push back your fingers, push back your fingers. Put down your head, please put down your head. Then you'll do it better, please put down your head. Now move it seven times slowly. This called as Brahmarandhra in Sanskrit language. Now that's all we have to do. 

Now again see to it that you put your both the feet apart from each other. Put your left hand on your left lap and take out your spectacles now. You'll have to now close your eyes, not tightly but lightly as you sleep and please don't open them till I tell you.

Now take the right hand on your heart. Please keep your eyes shut. Now here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself. You may call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like. In your heart you've to ask three times, "Mother, am I the pure Spirit?" Ask this question three times. I have told you that when you become the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit, you become your own guide, your own master.

So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to ask another fundamental question about yourself. "Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question, three times, "Mother, am I my own master?" I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force the pure divine knowledge on you. You have to ask for it.

So please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, and here you have to ask six times because this centre has got six petals. "Mother, please give me pure divine knowledge." Ask this six times. 

Now, as soon as you ask for the pure divine knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising. So we have to nourish our higher centres with our full self-confidence. So raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here, with full self-confidence, you have to say, full self-confidence, "Mother, I am my own master," ten times. "Mother, I am my own master," ten times. I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this intelligence, these emotions, this ego, these conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit.

So now raise your right hand on your heart and here you have to say again with full self-confidence, twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit." Please say it twelve times. 

I've told you this all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of bliss, ocean of compassion, but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you might commit, all can be dissolved into this ocean of forgivenes. So forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of left shoulder and left neck. Press it hard and put your head to the right. Here you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty at all," sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." Please put your head to your right, turn your head to your right, please. I've already told you whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. And at this moment, if you don't forgive, this centre won't open and you won't be able to get your self-realization. So it's very important at this time for you to forgive everyone in general, not to think about it.

So now please put your right hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your head, and here not how many times but from your heart you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone, in general." Please put down your head, that's very important.

Now, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading divine power. So now please put your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head, push back. Here you have to say, again from your heart, not how many times, "O Divine Power, if I have done mistake knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

Now, stretch your hand, the palm, fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood, all right. Now again please put down your head and you have to stretch back your fingers. Here again, I cannot force self-realization on you. So now move your scalp slowly, seven times, saying seven times. "Mother, please give me my self-knowledge, self-realization," whatever you want to say. Please say it seven times. Move your scalp, please. Not the hand but the scalp because you put, push back your fingers otherwise it won't move, push back your fingers to give, no no, push back your fingers, means outward, push back outward. (Shri Mataji blows into the microphone).

Now please take down your hands and open your eyes, slowly, you can wear your glasses. Now please put both the hands towards Me, like this. Some of you are already feeling the cool breeze but don't doubt. This is the cool breeze of the all-pervading divine love. All right, let's see. Now put your right hand towards Me like this. Right, and put down your head and see for yourself, if from the fontanelle bone area, you're getting any cool or hot breeze-like vibrations. Just put down your head and see for yourself. Sometimes people get it close, sometimes nearer. It's coming out of your head, don't doubt. It's coming out of your head. All right, now put the left hand towards Me. Now with the right hand, please see if there's a cool or a hot breeze-like vibrations are coming out. Put down your head, but one thing is there, if you have not forgiven yourself or not forgiven others it will be hot. So please try to forgive now. Now some people get it very close, some get it far away so move your hand and see for yourself.

Now please put your right hand towards Me again and with the left hand again you see on top of your head, if you're getting any cool or a hot breeze-like thing on your hands, on your palm. All right, now please put both the hands towards the sky like this and push back your head. Here again you have to ask one of the three questions I tell you. One question is, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost as described in the Bible?" This you can ask three times, otherwise you can ask, "Mother, is this the all-pervading power of divine love?" that is, Ruh, as described in Koran; or you can ask, "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?" as described in the Indian scriptures. "Is this the Paramachaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions three times. Now, push, come down. It's all right.

Now please put both hands towards Me like this, and watch Me without thinking. You can do it. Now all those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their fingertips or on their palm or out of their fontanelle bone area, please raise both your hands. 

I bow to you. The whole of Kuala Lumpur has got it, I bow to you. Your saintly life has started but you must value it, you must grow. For that we have a centre here, centres everywhere. Please attend, you don't have to pay, again and again I am telling you. But respect your self-realization. You have to become like trees now. I hope all of you will take care and look after your self-realization. 

Thank you very much. Now enjoy yourself and enjoy everyone.

I'll come next year again.
