How much I thank you, I do not know! to tell you today, on this occasion, It is a big achievement that thousands of because most of you are Sahaja Yogis. And those who are not will also be people have entered this New Life and transformed, everytime it so happens. a New Light has dawned in them. It is There were times when the attainment beyond anybody's understanding and of Sahajayoga in life used to be very belief that such a thing has happened. difficult. But now the things have But it has taken place. People from all changed. Now your Kundalini could be castes and creeds have got their awakened very easily. Without any Realization. They are not from any difficulty you could attain that state where particular strata of life; there is no high or low. Thousands of people have it is said that the soul resides within you, and within you that miracle should take received Realization, not only in India but place which makes you familiar with your also in other countries. Still we have to soul (Atma). This state was very difficult give it to many many more people. All the problems of our country will get to get in the olden days. Only a few achieve it as a result of penance of could solved by it (Sahaja Yoga). The problems of all those who have got it have been solved. They have developed thousands of years, living in Jungles and serving the saints and seers. But in this a new outlook, it is co-incidence that all age if people do not receive their Self- those who have received it are working Realization then, no one knows, what it out. I know only this much that this was to happen and it has happened. I never would happen to them and what abyss they will fall in. May be that it is the reason why Sahaja Yoga is working out thought that it will gain so much of in this Kaliyuga. momentem. Thave to say only this much that those Your contribution is also there in its who have got their Realization, should spreadment. Thousands have become not confine it to themselves. They should give it to others, distribute it among other Sahaja Yogis, and every one could give realization. Such a big thing has

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV Issue: 9 & 10 Septermber & October 2003 that people ask me, "Mother from where people. By giving, their joy will increase. have they got so much of knowledge?" Joy will be doubled by giving. There is no doubt about it that it is not something to be confined to yourself. It is to be This knowledge has awakened from within. It has awakened in them from within, where else has it come? It is the given, and this giving will give you joy. I hope you all will derive joy by distributing dawn, the expression of that supreme spirit that resides within. With it they it. know as to what is the Truth and what is For years together I have worked hard ahead of it. in India and also put very hard work in l explained it to my might. Now I find foreign countries. Now you have to do more than me. Only then ignorance could that people absorb it very easily. In be destroyed in world. The world is villages where people are not much submerged in deep ignorance. Today educated, they have understood Sahaja there is one problem and tomorrow there Yoga so well and they explain it so nicely! I am myself amazed to see their style.

You have to be very peaceful. This power much time. However, they have become will workout in you and with that power experts. Working themselves they have understood Sahaja Yoga and have you will transform others. For me it is a big achievement that so taken it to great heights. I am surprised to see that such much work has been done in Delhi. I remember in the beginning when I came ordinary people knew so much, they here, people knew nothing. They went have so much of knowledge! Many of their own way. Gradually they developed them are illiterates but they are so expert and knowledgeable that one is and gained balance in every way. With experience they realized the astonished as to how they have known so much and how they do so much of weaknesses and problems of human beings. Slowly they were trained. Now work. We have still to open some they have become so knowledgeable more fronts. Firstly we should talk of

 September & October 2003 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV Issue:9& 10 patriotism. It is essential to be patriotic. We should know the historical facts and There is no use forgetting them. Not only that but we have to spread these also how so many people sacrificed ideals in other countries. All the everything for the sake of the country. It's misunderstanding about our country will vanish and we shall be able to tell others necessary that you should have that'How great our country is'. Our good points should come up. By them people knowledge of it and you should talk to people about it. It's a great country and will know the greatness of our country. many great people incarnated in this want to say that you should all be very land. But now some curse has fallen on respectful to your country, to those who us. Many people came to us from have made sacrifices for the country, to abroad. Because of them we could not open our hearts to the people. But it is necessary to tell the people about all this. In foreign countries also it was told what those who have upheld the Truth and sacrificed their lives for the sake of Truth. You should have knowledge of such saintly people. Sahaja Yoga doesn't mean that you know only the greatness excesses were committed in India but that doesn't mean that you should know of this country. You also have to know its tradition, take to its culture. what the people of this country suffered. Under what difficult circumstances they It's the age in which we have lived! If you have understood it then you might have realized how great our developed likings only for imported goods and we have taken to the path of foreigners. It has done enormous harm to the people. How much difficulty it has put us in! Know the greatness and glory of your country and see it in your life and country is and what a monstrous upheaval it has gone through. When you become aware of it then you will be proud of your country and think what a great country it is. The culture of our country is very high. Nowhere else one lives of others. There are wonderful could find such a culture. I have gone to traditions here. By running away from these traditions we are going away from so many countries but our culture it. We stood on truth and because of that teaches us to respect everyone, love everyone, love the country and also it has big-big ideals. We have to follow those we have to face innumerable difficulties. You have to accept it. But the person ideals. standing on truth becomes immortal.

He is respectable, worthy of worship and to country. There are number of things a big which Sahaj Yogis have to do and they become like him will be have been doing also. Their lives have achievement. Butstill we don't recognise become so beautiful. Whether it is in the our country and instead of becoming its ornaments, we go on imitating others. It does not behove Sahaj Yogis; and I know family or outside, people praise them and say that how beautiful the lives of Sahaj Yogis do not do such things. But we have to t√©ll it to others also that there is pride of country, self-pride and different Sahaj Yogis have become! Firstly the blessings of the spirit and secondly the subtle outlook which makes you know and recognise goodness. Without that types of ideals of life. I think gradually it subtle outiook you are not Sahaj Yogis. There is a lot to say but I am thinking will develop. The number of Sahaj Yogis has increased. It has increased so much that many such people are present here that there is no need for me to tell much. who have not experienced their spirit. It Sahaj Yogis will themselves do this work. What I have to say is that if you are is necessary to have a session of Self- Sahaj Yogis then method and system of Realization for them. You should all stretch your hands towards me and sit your life should be that of an ideal Indian. silently, peacefully. Now please close Caste and religion should not be cared your eyes. Both the hands towards me for. The only significant fact is that you and close your eyes. Keeping your eyes closed, now say 'Shri Mataji' please give us Self-Realization' (say it in your heart are an Indian and it is your duty to be glory of the country and enjoy living in that glory. You should take care of each and every tradition of your country, its - without speaking). Keep your eyes music, art, craft and architecture.

Out of the various problems of our country, one big problem is that How could this system change in our country? Is there any remedy for it or not? Many a times I thought of writing about it but ultimately I concluded that there will here, there are different standards for men and women. I don't know how it has be no use of writing. Some permanent creeped in because nowhere in our scriptures we were commanded to do arrangement has to be made about it, that. It's written in our religious books, something has to be done. I wanted to "Yatra Narya Pujyant√© Tatra Ramant√© do something concrete. I have seen Devta'. Devas (the deities) reside where many such women who are begging on the road-sides. People told me that it is a women are worshipped. I don't nice way to beg. I replied, 'you will realise it only if only if you are made to beg'. The indifferent attitude that people of our country have developed for women understand how this state was developed in which we have no respect for women. I was myself married in U.P. and was surprised to see that women makes me weep. That is why I resolved had no significance in domestic life. to do something for shelter and food for There was no differance between the these poor women. Something must be done. The poor women beg on the roads, maid servents and the ladies of the house. How did it happen and why is it do everything. I called them at my house, talked to them. However I could not find continuing? Because people are not awakened to this problem. The way women have been treated, thrown out of any reason for their undergoing this the houses, makes one weep. Without travail. Man develops liking for any woman. I don't know why? The life of any reason women are thrown out of the women is very great. It is the foundation house. I had many such experiences of the whole world. They give birth to which anguished me. I don't understand thousands of children but people treat why the women are being tortured like them so insultingly that poor woman that! There is no arrangement for them goes to the brink of madness, tolerating to live. Once they go out of the house then all this. Because of her children she tries there is no one to look after them. Poor to face all atrocities very bravely. But ladies were thrown out with their small children. Those women are destitutes but what should she do? They have no

As an they do, where to go and from whom to experiment I have used it but it is a beg. No one allows them to knock at the wonderful thing. I don't know why our door. I could see no remedy to it, so I industry doesn't make things like that! It thought that the best thing for these is not difficult to make such a thing. I told women would be to build a dwelling for many people to use it, but then who will bother. There is neither difficulty nor them. Here they will learn something, learn to do some work-massaging, botheration. But Indians do not want to running small restaurants etc. But many change, they let the things go as they are. people are needed to help them, to make What could you say to them? In this them understand. Some place is also country there were many scholars and needed for them. With this target I have Sanskrit Pandits. They have imparted built this ashram and through this, knowledge in abundance. But people challanged the emotions of everyone. I are not aware of it as to what a great have challenged the love of the whole country they are born in and how much world so that people could see them with knowledge is there in it. They have no love. There is no fault of these poor respect for women. Women are treated women. Responsibility of their begging like beggars. Husbands drink alchohal and beat their wives and those who do from door to door lies on the shoulders not beat, give no facility to them. Some of our society. Being a woman, it moves me and I am anguished to see all this. When the construction startedI girl belongs to rich parents then it is all wished to complete it somehow.

Some of them have left their it. Its speciality is that the white colour houses and are begging. Some of them are rotting in the domesticity. They keep weeping in the house and somehow getting on with the life. I do not know why you are seeing is such that it will not get spoiled with a special technique it has been made. I learnt this technique in Itly. There I learnt to make such a colour which will never fade. Use it and see how the attention of the society, particularly beautiful it is!

Universities were established live with pride and self respect. We could there because of them. Women were given high education and people could set up some art and craft work and also see potential in them. Now we have built could we make many eatables and this institution and I request you to impart high level education, Then the capability of women would be judged suggest as to what could be done here. and seen that how many of them could Which education could we impart? We be self-sufficient. have also thought a lot about it but you Some times we find that women are are also well informed. You write to me misused even on such places, but those what else we could do for the betterment of these women. I have seen in foreign who try to be self-sufficient they should be helped, they should be looked after. What is being done in our society is very harmful. It is the sign of wickedness but we pay no heed to it. I don't know how? We should give some attention to it. The respect that we should have for woman countries that no one could harass women like this. Their condition is not so bad. It is the speciality of our country that women are put to misery. I have been living abroad for many years and have noticed this difference. It hurts me to see is absent. We torture them, beat them for that there is no value of women in our nothing. I have such stories of tortured country. Woman gives birth to children, women which if I tell you, you will not be looks after them. Also Indian women are able to control your tears. I have wept very charming, active, efficient and very over it a lot, but now I want to find out loving, Indian mothers are very famous. some solution to it.

Whenever they Therefore we should direct our efforts to come to India they touch the earth of this impart some such training to women so country and bow before it. They respect it so much that I have no words to express it. I never told them to do it. From that they are not insulted. We should also realise that we have to respect the woman and have faith in them. I have their own minds they have faith in it and seen such inhuman deeds that, one regard this country as 'Nandan Van' but they don't know the miserable condition that prevails over here. I don't want them to know about it. What is the use of cannot believe, are possible from one human being for another one. How could human beings cheat, harrass and torture the another one. Its a strange slavery! We criticising our own country? But at the have gained independence from the same time the short comings need to be removed. They should be finished slavery of Britishers but freedom from the completely. That is what I am telling to slavery of our own social system is more all of you that there is no specific reason essential than that. The number of women in.our country, is at least 70%, for women being respected in Western countries. But their laws are such. In India the remaining are men. Inspite of it, men have so much of ego that they don't no one bothers about the condition of allow the women to lead their lives with women and men think no end of self respect, like human beings. They are themselves. The women are very important part of the society and you and you children will have to face the results of all the excesses done to women. Now no animals. They are human beings and to give them respect of human beings is absolutely necessary. We have to understand and respect them. We have we find our children getting spoiled to start from our own house and see what because who is there to control them? is going on there.

The way things are happening here, I hope the small effort will bring some improvements and passengers. What could their poor mothers do? The poor mothers could say it will attract the attention of people and nothing, no one listens to them. This they will be drawn towards the problem outlook should be changed and attention should be given to the progress and for which I have been worrying and weeping throughout. People should see social status of our women. If it begins in every domesticity then things will that by Sahaja Yoga your spirit is improve all over. These conditions awakened and you have the knowledge anguish me extremely. Men failed to of the spirit. But you should have a accept the right of women. So I thought compassionate outlook towards others to spend on this project. Now such a after getting self-realization. Without compassion what's the use? Compassionately if you look, you will be concerned to see as to what miserable place is built which attracts attention of the people. Atleast some respect should be given to women. In our lives we could whirl our mothers and sisters have see their conditon. First of all we have to caught in. So its my request to you, to go all around and improve the state of see the condition of our own mothers and sisters and then look to the society. The women.

He replied,"that he has opened a If there is fluttering in the eyes then spiritual centre over there; he gave me deeksha (initiation)". I asked, what you immediately know that Aganya deeksha did he do? He said,"he taught Chakra is being hit. There is nothing to me the technique of this shaking. For feel bad about it. If Aganya Chakra is not I have suffered from alright then it should be cleared sixteen years diseases, I lost my job, I suffered this, I otherwise the joy is reduced. While meditating if your body is suffered that," I asked, are you not awakened still? If you have a guru then shaking and if you are not able to sit comfortably then you should know that you should not have all these problems. there is problem in mooladhara and this "How much money did you pay to him could be a dangerous situation. When so far?" "I have paid rupees five-six the mooladhara is affected then it should thousand to the centre". I said, you have be got cured.

If the elderly people are worthy the people that do they have some guru or some negativity. If there is a problem, of respect, they will be respected. So, they have to be worthy and the there is nothing to feel bad about it. But I see if one person has a little problem, youngsters should respect them. Even otherwise Sahaj Yogis should the another possessed one also stands with him; they make a queue together not disrespect other Sahaj Yogis and you could know that all these because you are all divine personalities. You can know all this in meditation. While talking to each other if you think deeply then you will immediately know that. "Oh! his Agya Chakra is catching. That is why negative people are sitting together. Actually they should not sit like that, they should sit separately. But they sit as if making a group. It's wrong. Like, Thane it is happening." Oh! his heart is catching people will come and sit with the Thane people and so-on. ≈†it separately, it's that is why it is getting done, that is why the proper sounds are not emanating". You will not feel bad about it nor will the necessary. Don't sit in groups. Another thing is that there are some old people, some middle aged and some other people do. But feeling bad is a 'big problem', a youngsters. There is nothing wrong with big obstruction. People take ill of what I the children but those who are old or middle-aged should sit separately.

 HOW TO OVERCOME EGO AND KNOW THYSELF Dollis Hill, November 18, 1979 Pravachan of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi understand, where you stand for it. How much you have to improve yourself? Because you are the people, who are going to take Sahaja Yoga to that position, A happening by which a creation of God is going to get its fulfilment and is going to know its meaning. It is that great! Perhaps we do not realise it. But when we say, we are Sahaja Yogis; you have to know that, to be Sahaja Yogi how where it has to reach. As far as I am concerned, I have nothing to do anymore. I have done it. Now it is for you to receive, you have to imbibe into it and you have to change the whole thing. That is your job and that is why it is a serious much identified you should be with the Truth of Sahaja Yoga; and so many misidentifications which are hanging on to you, must be got rid of. People call it a sacrifice. I do not think it is a sacrifice. If you think, something is happening in your way, you try to take out that hurdle. In the matter. in The second point: I always have been saying that due to ego problem, we are same way, if you stand out from your very much disintegrated. We are so obstructions, you will be able to disintegrated that, the connection with the understand that, these obstructions are Divine is never properly established. As standing in your way and they are not I have said it, that, this instrument your own and that they are stopping your (through which I am speaking) if it is divided into five parts and all the five progress. So you should let these misidentifications out of your minds parts are fighting with each other, you cannot get anything done through this instrument, though it is connected to the mains. In the same way if you still remain This is one of the problems I think, disintegrated, you cannot get that people have here. Whenever I get any connection. For example, you see complaints, or something of that sort, I people come down here, I have seen, for understand that, still the level of Sahaja Yoga. Now they have other understanding about Sahaja Yoga is not interests and other priorities and other upto that point. It is a tremendous task things which are very important to them. and for that if you are the people, who All the time, they are wasting their time have to come up; and if you are the for that and then they will say that, people, who have to fight it, you have to 'Mother, we are not progressing much in understand it in its full extent and also Sahaja Yoga'. If you decide, as Mr. completely, and try to be more and more yourself and not in tune with misidentifications.

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV Issue: 9 & 10 September & October 2003 23 Venugopalan has told you before, that comes to Sahaja Yoga. Still his ego is 'we have to do Sahaja Yoga first and the other things are secondary'-then only the have such a big ego as he has. I mean, Sahaja Yoga can be really established the way he will talk that, 'I don't do these into you. We will have some Sahaja things' and so on. I am myself amazed, Yogis of a very high level. I know that, the way people talk. As if, you see, we will have some of mediocre level. everybody has become the King of so big. Even our Prime Minister won't Some will be absolutely useless and some will be absolutely thrown out. We will have all types, that also I know. Now it is for you to decide, where do you come? How, far you are going to? If England or what, the way they talk! This is something, one should tell people, when they come here. 'Do not waste Shri Mataji's energies in arguing this and that'. Because everybody thinks no end of themselves here. And that is the biggest hurdle that they have, when they even come first time. You find it so difficult. have to show all my appreciation of their ego all the time', to just satisfy them; so that they come round. And that is why, the progress becomes less. Now in his case (Mr. Venugopalan's) you are going to waste your time in thinking about other Sahaja Yogis and small-small things and frivolous things, your disintegration is going to be increased, you are going to be separated much more as all these decisions are taken through your ego e.g. I don't like it, I don't do it. I don't see it'and the like. If you could somehow or other see your he has been a person, who has been to ego working, then you can get rid of it all kinds of horrible Gurus and his wife and that is the thing one has to do; not to also has been to all kinds of horrible fight the ego. I never say fight the ego but Gurus; because of another extreme in surrender it. It is the only way your ego -India we have, that we must respect all the saints. But these types of saints are can go. That is why the progress in the West, fake saints. Not only are they fake saints, as you have seen it, is much less than but some of them are devils. So they are that is in India. Take the particular case not going to say that,"We are devils'. of Shri Venugopalan. He is remarkable. When they do not say that they are devils He is the particular man who is doing or whatever it is, they do not come in their remarkably well. He is holding a very big proper forms. These simple innocent position in India. Here I have seen a people, who are seeking God, just go to person who is, say, a dish washer. He them, give their heart, do everything and

 24 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV Issue: 9 & 10 September & October 2003 understand that, we have a very great responsibility in the West. Because this has to happen in London. It has to happen in England to begin with and that is why you bear a very big responsibility. You have to evaluate yourself and Sahaja Yoga again and again and again and know that what makes you slow is your ego or even superego is there, no doubt. But ego is the main problem. I must tell you that, ego is the main problem but I dare not say to anyone that, this is your ego, because that will just jump on to my head. But, try to see your ego, how it is deviating. Because it is your own joy that you are seeking. Your own property that they find that they are devils. Once they discover that they are devils, then they are surprised. Then they come back and go to another Guru and another Guru. But the harm is done. But they get rid of that harm because they recognise that harm has been done and they know what the truth is and what to expect. It is the blessing of that country that the people know what to expect. You see, people like those good quality people would not like to go and will not go to a man, who shows some sort of sensationalisations or 'Chamatkaras, i.e. miracles. They would not go to them, but they will go to other subtler people, who are very you are seeking. It is your own that is hidden from you, which you have been cunning and put up another kind of a show and just say that, 'no, no, this is the seeking for ages. Now that is what I have to expose to you. What is there to argue with a person, who is trying to give you the highest? It is just a waste of Do not waste your energy on these things, frivolous things and finding faults. Now he has been organising our Delhi Camp. He is the one, who has organised the printing of our books and so on, so smooth, absolutely. I have not way you can attain the highest' and that is how most of the Sahaja Yogis in India also have been.

They must ask for I put you from my heart into it, and I get you out of it. The way you have got your their realization and they must know Second Birth, in the same way Christ what is Christ, within themselves they have to awake the Christ in them. was to be immaculate. But She put Him I was telling you that Christ said that in the heart and into the uterus down you are to be 'born again'. That I am to be born in your heart. Now the heart below and She created Him. Its very easy to doubt Him and say things against Him may centre is here as well as here. Because because He is no more. And the Jews must learn a lesson now. They denied the heart is controlled by the centre at Him once and they have suffered. Now the fontanel bone area and that's what don't deny Him again. You can't deny, the he said that you should get your

Now the people of various countries, And they showed me some of the even your country, went down to India photographs they had taken up of these and they never told that Christ was born Gurus, which show complete mockery of who was the Maha Vishnu. Because it these stupid disciples who were is already described in the Puranas that suffering in their body and suffering he is the Aadhara. He is the one who their mind in the presence of these once awakened by the Kundalini, will Gurus. So they have a double enjoyment suck your Karmas. They never went and : one the money and another is the told. So the Indians went on with their kingdom and third, the greatest of all, that Karma theory and these Gurus have their purpose is to kill you all and to come here to teach you Karma. It is destroy you all because you are that they achieve by their falsehood. Because these God's men are impressed by their amazing how you accept all these theories of non-sense! Like they say that you have to suffer because you have falsehood. Now see if there was any done bad Karmas. Then they will say that false Guru here, this hall would have been filled, the whole thing would be to give yourself balance you go this way or that way and you just keep it to balance. If that is so, that you have to go filled; on the road there would be a jam but the real Guru, I have seen not only here, everywhere, it starts very slowly. to one extreme and to other extreme then Of course in a place where people are very simple and who are very sensitive, is a different one. But people in the cities, specially, they are so insensitive to reality and so sensitive to devils that it is surprising that they feel very much at home with devils and very much lost with the reality. what are they doing here? Why are they talking? They should shut up, because they can't do anything. They can't give you realization. They can't save you from this situation, so its better that they suffer. Why do they say, "you should suffer"? Why should they say? Because they want to enjoy you suffering. They want you to suffer because they enjoy it. Now Because you are in falsehood so you so many of these disciples who came from these horrible Gurus, who said you real. You have to become that which is must know that you have to become the must have your karmas and you must the spirit, which is not so far shining in

Horrible fellow, and one better than the other! Then they took it in your central nervous system, in your awareness, and this is the spirit which is the one described. Not spoken before also in the churches, but today for the first time I am speaking about the Christ in a church and that's why I am very happy such a funny way because they became that at least in this church I could say supraconscious people. They started speaking the languages of so many evils. That part of Bible is wrong where they become not realized. The wind part is alright. But so many people, I have seen, they come to my programme, when they come for realization, they feel the wind for a while and immediately they shunt something that would establish itself and that when people will come here, I hope, they get their realization and that something works out here and they get at least awakening because so many saints are sitting in front of me. May be that one day will come in this church, may be, it may work out that the people will get one day their realization. Christ's life was only for 3-4 years. out and become supraconscious. Now we will see what is supraconscious entity subconscious entity. Now you see here these are two petals. These are two petals. One controls, of course, the pituitary, that controls the Ego and the Pineal, that controls the Super Ego. But and the Nobody allowed him to live longer than that. Whatever possible was done but such stupid people, such stupid people, you could not talk to them; and that's how they killed him. He could not speak to them anymore and that's how his life was this also has the capacity to blow it this finished. But in that small life of his what a spark, what a spark it was! The way way out and blow it out this way. people have behaved towards him was Supposing you become supra- atrocious. I must say, I must say that the conscious and you start thinking too apostle themselves, because this much, some thing about the future, what Matthews and this. He was such an must be the galaxies, we should find intellectual, such an intellectual, that he about this, we must find out about the would not accept the idea of immaculate stars and about all these things and conception. Very difficult man! He would argue it out. He said that if a virgin is going about future and about - say prophecies and astrology. It is all futuristic. You

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV Issue: 9& September & October 2003 40 people are mostly futuristic. You try to plan and every plan fails of course, but who has done that work of aura picturing. this thinking and planning is too much, Now after realization you don't get any can push up this side too much. Actually auras in a person, can't see aura in a have shown here it is this side. But person because he is integrated. aura, auras I was talking to some one actually when it is placed, it is placed like this. The ego is placed like this and super ego is placed like this. Here we could not show the three dimensions. So from the back to this side is Super Ego and from Completely integrated. But when he is in a mess, he starts getting the auras. Like if he had cancer he will get auras. If he is alcohalic, he will get auras. A kind of a crazy auras. A normal person may have auras, not so much crazy. But auras you cannot see when the whole thing is here to here is the Ego. Now this ego bloats out into this side and when it bloats to this side, it goes into the Supraconscious Area. So it comes up here. Now the supraconscious area gives you visions, hallucinations, L.S.D.; effect. Then you start seeing from the eyes of a person who is a dead person but a very ambitious person. For example you might get the vision of Hitler and all these horrible kings. You might get the colours, you may say the auras and one has to integrated. You can see in a light which has no aberration, that means it is good light; if there is aberration then it is a bad light. All the seven colours, colours of the light have to be concentrated and have to be integrated. If they are prismatic and if they are giving it separately then it is not one integration, and when it is one- integration then you cannot see seven lights. So the person is not integrated. understand here that these auras start Now all these auras come to us coming to us because we shift, we disintegrate from our being. That's how we start seeing something else because we are made of seven types of tatwas within us. But the people who are on the right side only believe in the five tatwas. They call them Koshas. I don't think if I have a type for that, but these are the Koshas that are created by the first centre, by the second centre, by the third centre. These are the physical words, by the forth one, then the fifth one separated from us. To see auras is not a good sign in Sahaja Yoga. If you are seeing auras, we have to bring you back to the same position because you have to be in the present and not in the future. You get disintegrated. For example if there is machine, say which takes the and the sixth and the seventh, and they

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV Issue: 9 & 10 September & October 2003 41 do not create auras out side. They create things which it has to work out inside near the heart. And these are throughout. One of them is spleen, created near the heart but as soon as another is pancreas. When it neglects the you get realization, they all become one. pancreas, you get diabetes. Not by They all merge into one and that is the sugar. Of course sugar, because it has spirit. So as if you can say, when the spirit exists in a prismatic way, then you get to convert it into fat. But if you do not have sugar then it's a double work. If you have sugar then it converts it into fat and makes it useful for your brain. But if you the auras of seven, but when it becomes integrated than you become one, all the aura become one. So integration is the aim of Sahaja Yoga as now l think I have told you that you could also go to the sub think too much and you don't take sugar, it's the double action. But if you just take sugar and do not think also can be conscious area, in the same way. The problematic because it has to convert too subconscious area is there on the left much of it into fat. You see, too much hand side. If you move into collective sub conscious area, you can be triggered into cancer. By this triggering you might get heart attack, something like that, work is given to it. So there is no balance. So one has to understand that too much sugar is not good but you must take sugar because sugar is needed, and stop your thinking. How do you stop your thinking, diabetese. only by rising above the Agnya Chakra. This is a very very important point at Agnya, that you must know, that the thinking Many people believe that sugar gives you diabetes. It is not true. Sugar does not give you diabetes. What gives you diabetes is too much thinking. Those stops, Now the thinking stops in you, like this. There is a way, it rises the thoughts and falls off. Another thought rises and who do not think too much never get. Indian farmers never get diabetes. They don't know what this disease is. Because think too much, you work too much. falls off. In between there is a place you This centre works too much. It has to called as "Vilamba' Now when the create food for the brain. It has to replace the brain cells and these brain cells are thought rises, it automatically falls off. Now this space is the place of present. This rises either from the ego or super fats, the new cells, the evolved cells. If it ego and goes into the past. The in- to be replaced. For that it creates, out of works too much, it neglects the other between space is the present. One is the

 September & October 2003 42 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV Issue: 9 & 10 the Kundalini, it has pierced through, it future, one is the past, Now this place pushes through and she fills these with When it increases then what happens the grace. The grace comes on this, is that Agnya chakra opens more and when the grace comes in, you start has to be increased. you become thoughtlessly aware. You relaxing, the centres also relax. The become thoughtlessly aware. You come centres are in tension, but when the grace comes in they go back into normal. So there is more, sort of, expansion and the thoughtless awareness starts establishing itself at the Agnya Now the Mantra of the Agnya Chakra is Lord's Prayer. It has got two sides Ham' and 'Ksham', 'Ham' means in the present. There is no thought. And the thought is the barrier between the creator and ourselves. For example if Chakra. you look at a beautiful stone that is placed there or anything, you watch it. Now if you want to think oh!, it looks like a man, it am' looks like a devil or it looks like a God or what ever it is. There is a thought in you. and Ksham' means 'I forgive". So if supposing this is catching, you have to say, I forgive. If there is ego within us, you should say 'I forgive.' If there is Super, Ego within us, we should say 'I am, I am: so it is 'Ham and Ksham, is the beeja, is So what you do when you are realized, you just watch, you watch and whatever the joy is put there of the creator, of an artist, completely it is within you, because there is no thought. There is no wave, there is no disturbance, in a the seed. It is the seed of the prayer, completely silent lake. All that is around Lord's prayer. it, all that creation comes into it, absolutely reflected and you enjoy the that the Lords prayer in not alright. I mean thoughtless awareness called as who are you? What do you know about Nirvichar Samadhi. There is complete it. Everybody is challenging everyone! Nirvichara where you have no thought What do you know? What is your and you start enjoying that creation authority? The trouble is every body is completely. The joy of that is there. entitled to do what they like with religion Now there are people who are talking and with God. Though they do not know Nothing is in between. So the anything about it, they are absolutely ignorant but they think they have a right because there is no political control over thoughtless awareness comes in when the kundalini crosses this Agnya Chakra. It does double work. Firstly, it makes you thoughtlessly aware. Secondly, because it. Even Hitlar can talk about Christ;

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV Issue: 9 & 10 September & October 2003 43 anybody can talk about Christ, and about the prayer that He taught you. Who are you to challenge it? Who are you to challenge him? I can't understand, how enlightened can only enlighten. Now about Christ you have to speak. I have spoken once about Christ for seven days one after another. There is no end to it. Such a great incarnation that I just do not know how to say that is. I have spoken all about him. As it is, we have many tapes in London. You can send for it. We do you challenge a person, without knowing your own position in relation to him. But this is a very very common thing that people do, and it is due to ego. Ego makes you high headed, and this is the worst I found that this high headedness are now going to have a centre here. Herman has offered his place and we will that you challenge God, you challenge Christ, you challenge everything which be sending those tapes there. As these 300 tapes we have brought in London which you can listen to, and see for you don't understand! yourself and all of these tapes are very good because they actually are Mantras. They work out the mantras and you also get listening to them, opening of your Your Mind is lim√≠ted. It's a very limited way. You can't do anything with this mind of yours. You have to go beyond it. Somebody has to trigger you into space. You have to go into that. You have to (Sahasrara) centres and all that Now the become the spirit. Only by realizing your spirit you can get connected with God, before that you are not connected. That's why you have to become the spirit and the spirit is the connection, is the link with God. There is no otherway you can be last one, which is embarrassing because he already has told you that and I am supposed to have been here, I think, which is the integration. The end of it is the integration of all these seven centres. All these seven centres are placed around this area called as limbic. Which linked with God. If you want to keep is the limbic area. Now if you cut it, the yourself in delusion, you go ahead. But this is the real thing I am telling you, this is the true thing I am telling you for which you should know, you can't pay,, you can't purchase it, you can't demand it, and you can't work it out. brain, the transect section of the brain, you will find it like a lotus. You can find it, that there is a marking look, like a lotus, opened out and it has thousand petals, are like this. But the colour is not alright. The grace of God has to come, fall You people are so fond of this pastel upon you to do it. Or a person who is colour, so they have used it, but we can

 September & October 2003 44 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV Issue: 9 & 10 the Swadhishthana Chakra. Then here say that this kind of a 1000 petals are is the Vishudhi Chakra, is the Viraat. The there. Now it is said in the Bible that I will appear before you like tongue of flames', and these are, they appear, they Vishudhi Chakra is here. When you catch cold you find you will have the problem here. But if you apply something here, you will feel better. And this is the Vishudhi Chakra which is related to your throat. Now if you have the problem with collectivity also you might find a big block here. Now at the back of it is Nabhi, here at the back. This Nabhi has the left all appear. But these are very large ones and they appear as living. Living flames in different colours starting from one to another and they are 1000 in number. Now the doctors argue that they can't be 1000. They have to be 992. I mean just imagine these foolish people who argue on that! But they do not know that they and right sides. As we have shown here the left Nabhi and the right Nabhi. There are 1000 in number and they are placed are two, left and right Nabhi. I don't know here. But in the limbic area all the seven ifI have told you about that left and right. centres are surrounding it. Like we have You can find out in the book. Now, so got now, you see from here. This is the Agnya Chakra. Here, behind it, here at you have got left and right Nabhi and the back exactly, just at the back is the also sometimes you feel that Nabhi is Mooladhara. Surrounding it, is the here. Some people do feel, who have Swadhishthana. Surrounding the problems with some kind of Gurus and mooladhara is the Swadhishthana. If you things like that, you see, then you feel. are catching on Swadhishthana, you can feel it within yourself, the heavyness. If you are catching on it you will have diabetes. I will give one example. But the whole void is here and this void is called as Ekadasha Rudra. This void, the whole of it goes like a great round, and this is very important because you get it from the void. If you go to a bad Guru or someone, you get this. And this Diabetic people get blind'after sometime, they loose the power of the eyes because this thing oppresses optic nerve which is controlled by the Mooladhara Chakra. We call it as Back Agnya. So this is the Swadhishthana Chakra, here at the is the one that is the rider. The rider, one who has eleven powers of destruction. The one who is going to come, slash out. Then he is not going to give you any council, he is not going to redeem you, back in the centre, here you find a hole, no realization. He will slash out those that is the Mooladhara and around it is

 45 September & October 2003 The Divine Cool Breeze Volumo-XV Issue:9& 10 think of it, or to the bugs? You are human beings. You should not who are not realized. That's the last, that you don't ask just now. Give some time more to save more people. Because he eat flesh which is of the bigger animals than yourself. Because that is horrible. is not going to question anyone, he is not going to allow any more time and that will be the time of complete destruction But you can eat the flesh of the animal which are smaller than you. There is no of all the satanic forces. So that is the harm in eating that. And this kind of a Ekadasha, here. That collect, because nonsensical vegetarianism! Don't do any all these horrible gurus are here. These harm to the animals? But they don't are the Ekadshas. One thing is to be mind, doing this. These Jains are the understood that one could get rid of this greatest, they are, you see, such just like suckers and they don't mind killing very easily. Now these two children of people for their money. They don't mind going for what you call, 'Shikari' hunting and killing anything but they will not eat a chicken or even the garlic. Now garlic as you know is very good for heart. But they don't eat garlic. Its very good for the heart. Its very good for people who have Rama who were born here and were endowed as the sun and the moon. The sun and the moon both are here, and the sun, as I told you Buddha, ultimately here and he became, ultimately, Mahavira. They are there. But when they were on this earth, Buddha talked about Non- got tendency towards hardening of the artries, where circulation is the problem, is very good to eat that and for cold. For people who suffer from cold, if they regularly eat a fresh garlic, say in the night, brush their teeth, then they will be much better off. So these seven centres violence and people thought non- violence to chickens, to bugs! These Mahavira people called Jains, we have got horrible community called Jains in India, and they believe in vegetarianism to this extent that they get a Brahmin, pay him and put him in a hut and bring all the are there. Now at the fontanel bone is bugs of the village and put all the bugs in the hut and bugs drink his blood. It's a the centre of the heart. Now just imagine, it is at that centre. So where do I exist? fact, even today and then they pay some money to the Brahmin because the bugs are fed. Now you just tell me this kind of nonsensical vegetarianism. Am I going to give realization to chickens? Just I mean all of them are seven centres, am just like a bubble, But am in so I your heart. So the key of Sahaja Yoga is that you have to recognise Me. If

 September & October 2003 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV issue: 9 & 10 46 am love. I can't help it. I really can't help you can't recognise Me, you can't it. I am campassion. One day I did feel very disgusted. Really once I did feel very disgusted with people, the way they were and I said that just forget it. And then progress in Sahaja Yoga. I have to frankly admit it. I don't tell this in my first lecture but I have to say that please now recognise Me. As your Mother, now I request you to recognise Me and you don't have to give Me anything. Just take suddenly I saw my photograph. I saw my eyes, and I said, "Nirmala, you are compassion, you are compassion, you can't help it. You just can't help it." I have to work it out. I know what it means, it things from Me. Just have it yourself but recognise Me, If you deny Me then this won't open. This will be always covered. means sometimes too much, too much, That's why at the end when you say but I have to work it out. Now some people come out with question; 'why you Mother?' I said, "Why not you?" It's the good idea. Come along with me. I did a lot. It would be the best for me to retire and my husband might give you the Mother, please give me my realization because I have come on this earth to give you realization. That's My job. Its one of the worst jobs that one can have. Because its not difficult with people to talk to them, to tell them about it and they are all the time up in arms, they are so pension and would be so happy that aggressive and they start fighting. It's the have found out somebody who will Mother's job which is a thankless job, replace me. But I have not found out absolutely thankless job. You have to do somebody who will replace me. I wish it, and also only the Mother can do it. you could, will be a good idea. Because if you had the Christ, he would Now the name Nirmala itself means have taken eleven things and finished immaculate. Means the one who is the cleansing power and the name of the Goddess also. My actually sign name is off everything. If you had Krishna, he has also 'Sanharak Shakti' to kill. But to use the whole thing which integrated ideas, Lalita who is the name of the Primordial balancing with understanding human Mother. That is the name of the beings, you have to have a Mother. And Primordial Mother. But to be a human that's why sometimes people try to being with all these centres around, we become very familiar and start taking work in, for example, from the last three advantage or taking liberties which is a days you don't know how much I am wrong thing. What ever I am, I am, and I vibrating. You can ask Waren and other

 September & October 2003 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV Issue: 9 & 10 there. Most of them know about it, but people. I asked them to take vibrations they can't understand why I have come to America? They say that why you come here, the people here won't accept. Butl don't think so, because I think you are and they were doing like this but they could not touch Me. They tried to put the hand on the head and they were just and then, they didn't know how to touch Me! Even it was so much vibrating. So its not great seekers, very great, born in this easy to carry all this load on this human body. Appear like a human being, to act like a human being, to behave like a special time. You have to work for Me. must say that the transformation that has taken place in the Western Sahaja Yogis has not been achieved by Indians, so much, though they have an advantage because they are born ina country which human being, so that there is a rapport. Why an incarnation is needed. There has to be a rapport because the unconscious can't talk to you. Whatever you see in the keeps the attention intact. The attention dreams comes back to you afterwards from the sub-conscious area. All the is very much intact; so it is easy to work it out there. Here it is difficult. It does not ideas, you have such a mass, such a confusion and you can't decide anything. So it has to come on this earth as a apeal to people but still you are all great people. So many of you are not but they can be all saints. But those who are here human being and tell you with the knack. I never knew English all my life. So first time I learnt English, but stillI don't know American English. I hope I will be able to learn something more when I travel around. It's a dream that, it is a desire that should know that you have the greatest opportunity in your life to be realized and to give realization to others. First of all you have to become alright, then you can give light to others. Now the greatest thing that is needed you are to be realized. Its all written in for Sahaja Yoga is wisdom. And logically the Bible, its all written in all the books you will reach a conclusion and understand that Sahaja Yoga is the end of all the problems of the world, of all the problems; for example take the capitalism and the communism. Sol am the capitalist because I have all the powers but I am the communist because Ican't enjoy it without giving it to you. But of scriptures. It is very large, large in the books of Adi Shankaracharya who had described Me in full, in a very beautiful way and it is very easy for Indians to get it. I mean though I have not much disciples in the city but they are aware of my advent and they know that I am

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XV issue: 9 & 10 September & October 2003 48 its continuing. I have not to do anything because I think about it and it just works. It is like that. All the problems, political supports it. You are completely integrated in one being that is your spirit. May God bless you all. Normally I don't tell about myself but today he forced Me as soon as I came problems, economic problems, everything can be solved. Krishna has said, 'Yog Kshema Vahamayam'; when here to tell because its not tactful. Its not tactful to say anything. Better, that you discover Me than I tell you. Because Christ was crucified, everybody was tortured. I do not want to hamper my work because it makes no difference by telling you get your yoga, you will get your well being. He has summed up. He could have said Kshema Yoga Vahamayam'. He did not. Yoga Kshema Vahamyam' He said first do yoga. First unite. Unite with the spirit; then you are blessed by you anything before realization. Its better to tell you after realization that 'l am the Holy Ghost. No doubt, I am the Holy all these things. There is centre of even material wealth, of Laxmi, which works Ghost, and the one, about which the out, and all the Sahaja Yogis who have Christ has told'. I had told them, I have been to Me are blessed by material never said this from a platform and I told because they have been telling me, "Mother you must say once. I said in America I will declare. So today I I am the Holy Ghost, I am wealth also but not too much like Mr. Ford, that is an extreme case. That is a headache. But they get wel being from every angle in a balanced way and an integrated way. So the last message is of integration that you get completely integrated. Whatever you do, your heart supports it, your mind supports it and your body declare that the Holy Spirit who has incarnated on this earth for your realization'. May God Bless You.

Shri Bhaswarasuri
Shri Bhaswarasuri, in radiance you shine,
You are the Holy Ghost, all adoration Thine,
Mother, You are the Devi, and demons You do slay,
You protect the Devas, and those to You who pray,
Creator of all that is, of all this Mahamaya,
You guide and help all those who have spiritual desire,
Transformation You have wrought, Your Chaitanya does blow,
This breeze, Divine does integrate all things in me, You know,
In others too, I see the change, and as all things work out,
I see the truth, and feel the joy, which leaves me in no doubt,
That now, at ease surrendered, whole, I feel that I'm in no doubt,
That now, at ease surrendered, whole, I feel that l'm in You,
I've found again my innocence, there's little left to do,
Except, at times, proclaim to all, "You too can know what's true l"
