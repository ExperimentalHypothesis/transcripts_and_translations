There must be something special here. We should understand that these people have come from so far, from foreign lands. We should try to understand what they get here. We need to keep this much understanding

Maybe due to our economic situation, we haven't given much thought to this. But if we think about it, why people from 14 countries come here, we'll realize many things. We still don't know much about our own religion. Our religion, the Indian religion, is ancient, but it has been reconstructed many times. Finally, in the 6th century, Adi Shankaracharya took incarnation and reconstructed  this religion again completely  and wrote many books on Kundalini Yoga. He openly said that without Kundalini, there's no other way.”He said everything by focusing on the truth”.

Similarly, Lord Krishna said that you should achieve a witness state , which means you should attain self-realization. We understand the word 'self-realization,' but we don't know what it truly means. Now it's time to share this knowledge with people.

<PAUSE> But because our thinking is not very deep, we continue with our traditional practices only. Means now we beat the drums and go to Pandharpur. But  our parents did not got anything from it. Even though we did not get anything.Did we beat the drums? To meet Pandharinath. Meeting with  Pandharinath doesn't just mean going to the temple and breaking our heads. We need to understand this.

Even if we're uneducated, one thing should be clear: Instead uneducated people should understand very easily that going to the temple and breaking our heads will help us in finding God?Will not find it. Has anyone found God this way? No one has found it. Has anyone's addiction been cured?  Have people's quarrels stopped? . Has anyone's nature improved? No one improved.You people blame God for this. Has our poverty ended? No. Has our misery gone? No. Have our troubles disappeared? No. Have our illnesses been cured? No. Then what God has done people ask me this question several times. We run around so much for God's sake, and now you're talking about God in this modern era, Mataji.So Where has God gone? What wrong have we done?The main mistake is that in all the big books,what all we have  including the Vedas,etc it's written that we need to attain self-realization. First We have to meet our own spirit. Our spirit needs to be awakened first. That's what if you see from Ramdas Swami to Tukaram  ,you all sing their bhajans while beating drums, but they all said the same thing: become self-realized.Then you all say to become self-realized,become self-realized.

But who should become self-realized? Recognize God. Recognize God and let Him reside in your heart. But how do we do that? This question should arise in your minds: how do we do it?

Things to talk about, 'The talk is just rice, and the talk is just curry.' What does that even mean? Nothing seems to be happening. We don't see anything good happening to us. Then people sit against God. Then they adopt communism. They say there is no God. There are many countries in the world like that. They say there is no God. How can there be a God? If there were, why would things have turned out this way? But the straightforward answer is that we still haven't established a relationship with God. As long as we haven't established a relationship with God, we have no right to make any claims on Him. Now, if this device or machine hasn't been connected, if there is no relationship, can I speak to you through it, and will you hear it? It's the same with us. When we have no relationship with God, we keep crying out to God, 'Oh God, do this, do that,' we keep ordering Him Daily,as if He is right in our pocket. But what have you done for God? Just remember one thing: you still haven't experienced self-realization. You haven't had self-enlightenment. That needs to be achieved. Some of us claim to be big Muslims, some claim to be Hindus, some claim to be Christians. Everyone is a bead on the same string. No one has experienced self-realization. Everyone is just fighting among themselves. They find reasons to fight over something or the other.

<PAUSE> The main thing, the core of Hinduism, the central principle means is to achieve  self-realization. Ask anyone. Anyone who has read even a little can tell you. Namdev said it, Janabai said it, Tukaram said it, and Gnaneshwar said the same. But when it comes to Gnaneshwar, it's often associated with 'wearing a dindi.' We had gone to the temple of Gnaneshwar once and said, 'Let them meditate.' They replied, 'No, you wear the dindi.' We asked, 'Did Gnaneshwar wear the dindi the first time?' You wear the dindi in the name of Gnaneshwar. Did he wear it? He was roaming around the jungles, wandering. No one accepted him, and now also don’t accept me . But who told you to wear the dindi? Did Gnaneshwar tell you? No? Then..

Now, when I say this in front of you, you have placed them in a statue. What can I say to you now? If they were alive, they would have corrected you. But if they were alive today, you would have tortured them. After death, you start placing the dindi. This is the current degraded state of our religion. This religion needs to be re-established, and everyone should pay attention to this. Just because you think you’re great, no one will consider you great. Until there is awakening within you, until there is the light of religion in you, no one will respect you. Now, just yesterday, I tell you, I lost my way while coming. I went ahead and entered a shop. Everyone there was in a daze. They were all like that, from here to there. Now, who could I ask about the way to Modak Sagar? Everyone was in a daze. Finally, I went back and caught a servant, and he told Baba  to go back. He was the only one who was conscious. How, I don’t know. The rest of them, too, were going to be out of work in a little while. This is our condition. And what is the point of feeling sad about it? Until our soul doesn't give us light, we don't understand anything. We don't have light within us. We don’t even realize what divine power is. How much we can utilize that divine power, and how much great work we can do through it. We say, ‘We are villagers Mataji, what would we understand?’ You all don’t need to understand anything. There is no need to even think too much. It happens easily and naturally.

<PAUSE> What have you achieved by thinking aimlessly and causing disturbances? Nothing. Now, how does self-realization happen? It happens only through the awakening of Kundalini. This is what all the scriptures tell us. So, what is there to debate about it? The path of devotion has been prescribed so that you remember God, stay in His meditation. But even if God Himself appears before you, please recognize Him. Why is He not recognizable? If tomorrow, Ram or Krishna were to appear before you, would you recognize them? If the Goddess stood before you, would you recognize her? No you will not recognize. How would you recognize them? What is the sign to recognize? Until you realize your soul, you will not accept any recognition. That’s all that will happen. Now, we say this is a self realised place, Mataji. Based on what? Someone has told you that's why. Do you know whether it is a self realised place  or not? Do you know anything about it? No, you don’t. How do you recognize if something is a self-realised place? That’s the question. How do you recognize whether someone is a fraud or a true sage? How do you know if they are good or bad? Is there any way to recognize? Even if something seems positive on the outside, is there any way to recognize if it is true from the inside? There is only one way. The light of your soul must awaken. There is only one way. There is only one answer to this. The light of your soul has not yet awakened. That’s why you are confused. When the light of the soul enters a person, then the param chaitanya touches them on all the fingers from all sides.

<Please sit quietly all of you.That lady, What's wrong with you since earlier? Just sit quietly. Can't you stay quiet for two minutes? You all are used to going to the temple, right? Go to the temple, scold God if you want, or do whatever. Just sit quietly.Sit quietly. There should be at least some discipline. People have come from outside. What will they think of you?>

Human Being ,who has the belief that whatever he does for the sake of God is acceptable.Reciting God’s name is enough for them. Feel like drinking alcohol,feel like beating his wife, or even feel like committing murder. Feel like doing any kind of work if God’s name is taken, it's considered fine. You Believe in Him.But how do you truly believe in Him? Has dharma truly become a part of you? Is there  love for others in you?Do you have compassion for others? If you do, even then, your ego will come. You may think, "I do this much for others," ,”I do that much for others “.But  if human being gets their self-realization then they don't say like that.He will say that it is happening .It is happening.It is happening for this also.It is happening for that also. In that state, the individual starts speaking in the third person—"It happened, it happened, it was him, it was her" (laughs). He moves beyond actions and becomes detached from the ego. He doesn't say like this, "I did it, I did it." This thought fades away. Self pride is completely lost.But this to happen/achieve one should get his self realization.This is what I am saying.But where did you bring religion into it?.Still the religion is not yet established fully.So now you all are saying that please establish religion Mataji.But I have a slightly different thought on it. Understand the difference, and then you will get a better idea of Sahaja Yoga. Earlier, it was like, you clean up. Clean up every single person well. The gurus would work hard to get people cleansed. Even if just one person left, they would forcefully cleanse them out. They would beat them, do this, do that, like real gurus. Not fake ones.What about the fake ones? Give them money and it's done. But I’m talking about the real ones.Praising fake gurus is very much famous here.But still one should understand in this that if a person is real he will never take money from you, he will not live on your money.He will never take money from you. In fact, he will give you, but never take from you. God cannot be sold. That's the first thing. If this kind of fake guru culture grows, we end up getting trapped in it, and since Mataji is against this fake guru culture, we go against HER too. But how long will these fake gurus last? Tomorrow, if they cause you trouble, you’ll come to me crying. Mataji, that fake guru took all that money and left. He took so much money and left.But first we have to understand what true religion is.

Datta's birth anniversary was celebrated. The main thing is Datta's birth anniversary.  But do you know who Datta is? And you all celebrate but do you have any relationship with Datta? All those who are Datta devotees. All those who have not received their self realization will have a stomachache. Write it down from Me. If someone has a stomach ache, go and ask them if they are Datta's devotees? Because Datta is very angry. Datta is sitting in your stomach. He is the one who is angry with you all. If you really have a relationship with Datta, you wont get any disease. If you are really related to God, then no disease even like cancer will happen to you, on the contrary, it will get better. If this does not happen, then what is the benefit of that God. So, those who follow such a path should think like this, do something externally. We just celebrated Datta's birth anniversary. Why is it like this? Then what? We brought rice, we brought this, we brought that. We had fun. Then say something like that. You had fun. You entertained. But Datta's birth anniversary was celebrated? Datta Jayanti will happen when you have realized yourself. Everyone celebrates Datta's birth anniversary. Everyone does. But these people have realized themselves. So Datta Jayanti means that you cultivate the religion that Datta taught within you. You have to cultivate it. You have to get into the essence from within. You have to immerse yourself in it. Then there is  a meaning to Datta Jayanti.Otherwise, you just have to entertain yourself in the name of God. That is also acceptable to some extent.God is not entertainment. He is a joy. What is entertainment? Today, there was entertainment. We laughed and played. We started crying again.

Joy does not have two sides. There is no happiness or sorrow. There is only joy. Pure joy. You should get that pure joy. It is within you. It is all within you. I come here to give that joy to you. But you will put your head into it. “The most intelligent are their oxen empty”. It is a very true saying and I feel it very much that these people are so educated but not very intelligent. We are very intelligent. So, has our nature changed since then? Has anything improved for us? Has anything improved for our children? Has our health at least remained good? At least do we have that much strength? That we will not take any addiction. Are we capable? <Pause> That we are still very weak-minded people. When we see a bottle of liquor, we run there. If we can get two paisas to eat, we quickly eat it. If we can harm someone, we sit and think about it.

That divine love has come within us. That the power or the strength of which we can do good to others has come within us? No, it has not come, has it? Then get it. It must be acquired. It does not require any education. It does not require any big education, no reading. It does not require anything. This power is dormant in every human being. It is called Kundalini. Once it is awakened, it sprouts. But after that, it becomes difficult to grow it like a tree. Especially in our Maharashtra. Because we use our minds very much. Once that sprout sprouts, it must be nurtured and taken care of. Every farmer knows. We have to nurture it and make a beautiful tree. We have to make a tree and then no matter what happens, even if it gets into a storm, how does that tree stand in our midst? In the same way, we have to stand in our midst. This is a sign of self-realization.

I am your mother and what I explain to you is for your good and welfare. But it all goes over your head. No one listens at all. It is not coming to anyone's head. Now even after coming here so many times, there are still the least Sahaja Yogis in Vaitarna. It is very sad. The least. In comparison to India, and to the whole world, there are very fewer people in your Vaitarna. Yet we give them so much importance. People of Vaitarna have come. Take care of them. But here, I think the saints and sadhus have never come. Maybe it is. Because this desire that we should get self-realization and take all the knowledge that we get for free is natural in everyone. It should be innate. But it is not. Now, however, some progress has been made. I am very happy with it and may God's grace be upon you. Get the blessings of God. This time has come. And it is a time of emergency. At this time, whoever will achieve their realization will be there and others will remain as it is .This situation is going to happen. I am saying this. Then later you will say, look, Mother, you did not tell us clearly. Now, I have told you as much as I can tell you as a Mother and I have explained to you that you should pay attention to Sahaja Yoga. Take care of your own health. Do good to yourself. As Krishna said, “Yogya Shemah:Vahamayam”.Krishna said, after yoga only I will do your wellbeing.He did not say that I will take care of your health and wellbeing. He did not say that anywhere. It was asked to him. So he said, I will take whatever fruit or flower you give me. But when he speaks, he uses a word. Do undivided or exclusive devotion. Exclusive means when there is a relationship with God, it is exclusive,seeking nothing else. Whether it is there or not. When there is no other,there is no relationship with God. Then there is no point in doing devotion. He has said this word “Ananya Bhakti” many times. Even in karma, he has correctly stated that whatever karma you do, leave it to God. A human being cannot leave it to God. Because if you say, I do everything for God. If you steal and you leave it to God. I kill someone and leave that to God. If a human being does any work for someone then he thinks that no he has done something special.Reason Why? He still has ego within.

But when you realize yourself, you do not say that I have done it. You do not say that God has done this. You say that it is all happening. Happening easily. Mother. Everything is happening. It is happening easily. This happened easily. Whose event happened easily. Sahaj. Sah means with you and born within you this  Kundalini and its connection with God is your birthright. The yoga you received from her. The worthiness/qualification to establish the union with GOD is there within you. But you do not have it. It is your right. You take it. Take your right. I am saying this with full of my heart in front of you. But still, this all whether it is going into your heads or not this God only knows.Then the situation of all of us should be good. Our children and families should be good. Our house needs to be in good condition. We need to keep that in mind. We need to think about that.

Now I will tell them this for two minutes. Look how calmly they will listen. They don't understand your language. They don't understand a single letter of Marathi language. But how calmly they listen. Well, if you ask them what you understood from Mataji's speech? They will say that they were receiving param chaitanya from it. We were just feeling that. Because they all are in that state.They are all Sadhu n Saints. So we were receiving this param chaitanya. What about us? Whatever Mataji was saying was a mantra for us. Then we were just receiving the param chaitanya from it and even if I had kept talking like this for six hours, they would have remained sitting. But shouldn't that state come to us also? Their economic state is better. But at least our cultural state is better than theirs. Ours cannot be said to be the least but still our spiritual state is better as compared to theirs. Our religious/dharma state is better. But where did we go wrong? Extreme smartness. I will not say anything beyond that. At least a little humility should come. It will not happen without humility. So now, when you reach the end of the path of devotion that you have taken, come to the temple, because there you will wander back and forth. Nothing comes in the temple. Devotion is the path and the goal is the ultimate goal. It is self-realization. I have come to give that. We did it in our previous lives. We did it in that lives. In every birth, you have been devoted to God and so only you all have been taken birth on this yoga land and still now also keep doing the same. Now receive it. For which you have done so much devotion. You have broken so much, the day has come for you to receive it. That You should achieve it. It will be good for you. It will be good for your children. It will be good for everyone in every way.

Sit down. Now just keep your hands in this way. Straight <Hoon>. <Pause>Just keep your hands like this, everyone. Sardarji do the hands like this. Ha. Come on, everyone do the hands like this. Why did they start running ? Look at this. I call them. Oversmartness. Do the hands straight. Do the hands like this. First see it is very easy and close your eyes.

<Pause> Now see if in your head you all are getting cool or not? See if you all can feel cool.<Pause> Now look at your head. Is it coming out of your head cool or hot? First it will come out hot. Is it coming out? Hot or cold? Cold. First some people will get hot. Let the heat come out. Then it will come out cold. Now bring your right hand towards me. Raise your left hand and see. See if it comes out?

It is coming. It is coming. Up, up, Hold it up. This is the Kundalini. This is what She came out from inside. This is like what Param Chaitanya means. This is the Adi Shakti Adi Maya. This is HER form. Look at this. Now a cold is coming out of your head. Up ,Hold it up, up. Now on the other hand. Now see if it is coming in your hands. Is the coolness coming in your hands? Yes. Do this hand again. It should come. If it does not come, then there is something wrong. Look again. And you will be completely thoughtless. No thoughts will come now. There are no thoughts in your head; see. Are there any thoughts?

No. Look. Hmmmm. Now do both of your hands like this. Coolness is coming. Very tremendous. Now ask the question in your mind. Mother, is this Chaitanya?

Is this Brahma? Ask this in your mind. This is Chaitanya. Please ask the question. Mother is this brahma. Is this chaitanya? Ask a question. You all have got it.<Pause> Hmmm, has it increased? It has  increased. What? Has it come? Has it come or not. <Pause> Hmm (pause) Now everyone will say Mother how you do it?Nobody does this. But if I am doing it, that means I should be someone great, right? Is it true that I am doing it? Then I must be someone great. But We are not considering this. Why  should I do it  unless there is something? There must be something. We should always look at it the other way around.

<Pause> Now close your eyes and keep your attention here. Close your eyes.

<Pause> Hmmm. Done.It is coming.Did you all felt cold on your head. Okay, now I will be going.

Now it will come next year. This year's program is over, now it’s for next year. At that time, if the land becomes available, we’ll start — we’ll build a school here for you. And you people will get work, you’ll get employment, and you’ll get a lot of opportunities to learn. And if we manage to start our own school, then this whole area will benefit from it. Because outside from here, people are doing very well. But stay with love. We shouldn’t oppose everyone. They have not come fo some election campaign. They don't want anything from you. Understood? Alright, we’ll leave now.
Victory to Adi Shakti Shri Nirmala Mata! Victory to Adi Shakti Shri Nirmala Mata!

They got it so fast.
<PAUSE> Clapping...
 That I couldn’t even say "put your hands to this chakra or that chakra" — they just got it. They are such simple and good people.
Over there, you have to work hard to get it.
Here, it happens quickly — but it also fades away just as quickly.
Just like we got independence — it's the same kind of thing.
It came for a moment and then went away.
Nothing remains.
It doesn’t last.
But it should last.
It shouldn’t be momentary.

How important this is!
Don’t let this remain momentary — think about it.

Also, we have our photos and all. If you want them —
The photos you brought — some photographs —
You can come and collect them from that bungalow; okay, we’ll send them to you tomorrow as well.
Those photos have vibrations, just so you know.

People have been healed by those photos.
How that works — we’ll explain it to you tomorrow, take some time to understand it.
And these people here will explain everything to you as well.
