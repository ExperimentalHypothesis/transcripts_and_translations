Public Program "Talk about Kundalini". Caxton Hall, London (UK), 10 July 1978.

Those who have come for the first time, please come forward. This is better. Those who have come for the first time, please, just, no, you can sit on the first and second row so we’ll know that, because those who have come, are here. Please come. There’s nothing to be afraid of. Makes no difference. Come along.

Those who, other people, and we have to realize one thing: that a human being is born in a different style than an animal. A human being has a sense of ego. A human being will know what is repulsive, what is not, a fragrance that we call as beautiful. Maybe that if a buffalo is passing that way, may not notice it, and he would not mind any kind of filth around. God has made human being a very special one. Now with our intellect, with our growth, in our understanding of things, the awareness that is developed, of course through our ego, our effort. But still when human beings reach a certain stage of development they realize that the joy of life is not in matter. They realize it, rationally, not through any experience, but rationally they see themselves. They see around and they find those who are materially equipped are not happy, rationally. But there is something innately built in a human being, that he’ll try to think beyond. He wants to know beyond. He doesn’t feel satisfied with himself. 

He knows [how hard efforts?] that [unclear] asked for. Like Gautam Buddha; he was given all the comfort, everything, all the indulgences, all the pleasures of life, but still He wanted to know something beyond, and that beyond is within us. We go to various places to satisfy this spiritual urge within us. We listen to it. We run about. Even in the pleasures that we find, there’s nothing but is the [serene?] spiritual [effort?], because we do not find any joy in these states. That’s why we turn ourselves to God, to spirituality, to [science?]. But we do not know how to find it. You try the same [tool or old?] method which you have used so far. Supposing you have to find something for yourself, you use your effort, which is, you have to put in an effort. That’s the way we have lived all our lives. By putting effort only you have been able to exist. Even from the stage when we were amoeba, the amoeba had to put in some efforts to get to this state. So this [kind?] of our life has been through effort. But then, even when we think of the beyond, naturally we think of putting in some effort about it. What will you do? So we read books, they will read bibles, we go to church, we go to temples, we go to mosques. Then we start going on seeing people, the holy people, and still you do not find it, because it is within us. You are trying to find it outside. This is said everywhere: it is within us. It is within that all the source. It is in our heart that the source of joy exists. But we go outside; we try to find out from others. Human beings have developed really surprisingly. Many seers have been seeing this. Like Freud, we can say, like psychologists. Other sciences like medical sciences and things like that. And they have also reached the Moon. But still outside. 

There is no way of going inside. You do not know how to take your attention inside; that’s the [way it is/that’s the main thing]. That’s how you feel frustrated. You reach a point when you say, “No, this has not worked for me.” You try to do every sort of it. Whatever somebody says, “All right, by standing on your head you will get it,” you’ll stand on your head. I mean, not that you have [failed/felt] yourself. You’ve not [failed/felt]. You’ve done whatever was asked for, but still you did not find it. There is also another thing]. Some of them are really talking like this, that you have to find it within yourself. But you don’t know how to find it. You don’t know which is the way to find it, how to take care of your [inner side/attention inside]. You are listening to Me. You are paying full attention to Me, but if I say, “Please pay attention to yourself, within,” you cannot. But supposing you are paying attention to Me and this glass falls down, something happens, immediately your attention will be attracted towards that. So to attract your attention inside, some happening has to happen within you. There has to be a happening. Something has to happen within you by which your attention is attracted inside. Now this is not brainwash. If somebody brainwashes you, “All right, you do this, you do that and you do that.”  A very simple way. A happening must take place within you so that your attention goes inside to know yourself. And if that is twisted ahead of you, if after this human stage you have to jump into that, then there must be something built in us. After all, God could not have created us from amoeba to this stage for nothing at all. 

Now people, there are some people here having a big controversy about evolution and God. There is nothing like that. You see, it’s very integrated. God has evolved us. Scientists won’t accept, but He has, whether they accept it or not. He has helped us to come to this stage, and still these scientists have accepted this, that it would not have been possible to become a human being in this short time, in the time [that/as] receded from the Sun. It was such a very, very little short time that even a living one unicellular animal like amoeba could not have been created by the law of chance. But they do not [want/know how] to explain. You see, whatever they do not want to explain, they cannot [explain or express?]  as thought. Another man says, “This is God.” But still, why should you accept that? Why should an intelligent man accept God, because Mataji said so? Why is it? Why would any scientist accept God? Say, “It is all right. Set Him up.” So the time has to come where you have to prove Him. You have to convince, not mentally, but by experiencing Him, by understanding Him. 

Now there are many psychologists who believe in the universal unconscious and they have proved it, that there is a universal unconscious. [That] this gives us in our beings lots of balance, courage, harmony, and they have tried to prove how people who depend on their unconscious are always helped in life and are happy. But they too [being?] human beings could not grow at the complete synthesis, synthesis of this truth, but only part of it. Like they can come into dark rooms say, “This is this. This is this.” Another comes from the other side. He says, “This is this. This is this.” But the complete truth, they could not put forward. So they are also [denying/denied?].

Now the style of human mind becomes a denial style. It goes on denying. He says, “No, not [this or true?]. This is not true. That is not true. Even science is temporary. It doesn’t exist. It’s not true. God is not true. No guru is true. Nothing is set.” Then they [slept] on it. But there is an urge. If there is an urge for drinking water, that means there must be some water provided for. If you believe that there is God who is compassionate, who is kind, then you cannot think Him to be that cruel as not to give you the water of life. Always so many of them have preached people – like Christ, Krishna. They were right about all these things. They cannot be all wrong. But there has been always a gap between the people who are born at that level and people born at this level. And they could never explain; only those who are sensitive accepted them. So now we are at a juncture of a time [where/when] something has to be done to prove it. It has to happen; the happening must take place ? that, too, en masse. It must happen to many people. And when that happens to one person, he is crucified, he is given poison, he is treated as mad, insane, till he lives. When he dies they’ll make temples, churches, wear diamonds, move about seriously, preach about Him. When He lives, murder Him. 

So the time has come for us to have a new awareness, a new dimension by which we can make out who is true, who is not true, by which you will reach that universal unconscious, by which you get connected with that collective being about which everybody has been talking. Even Lyle and [the recent?] biologists talked about it. It’s a being which is a collective being, and he thinks that it can embody himself and come round to tell us and decode about the universal unconscious. Everybody has their hoping for this. So it must happen. It has to happen, and it happens because you have got within yourself a complete mechanism built-in through your evolutionary process, which is now shown here. This is a very subtle thing. It’s an energy, and we cannot see it. The doctors can’t see it. We have here about two, three doctors sitting down, and they find that medical science is [relevant/available] now after getting into subtlety, because whatever is available through the senses, that’s all we can grasp. But whatever is beyond the senses, you cannot. Either we should develop an awareness which is beyond the senses, like a person should have a microscope to see things on the microscope, or you should say, “It doesn’t exist.” You cannot force people to say something if they do not feel. 

But I am just telling you about this instrument that is within us. But you need not believe Me. But you need not deny Me also. It is both things. This instrument is within us placed like this. Now I’ll tell you, there are seven centers placed. The first is the red one that you see. Down below is the red center which is called – I mean, in the Sanskrit language you have names. It doesn’t mean that it is Indian, but it is only in Sanskrit language you have the name. It is not the property of Indians or anybody. It is the property of the whole world, and everybody has it. But as in the medical sciences, the names are only in English. And there are so many things. The words are only in English, like “economics” and all that. One doesn’t deny it. In the same way, if some things are in Sanskrit language, you shouldn’t be angry about it. And you shouldn’t feel that, “How can that be?” Some things can be known by others also who do not know English language. So it is like that, because India is a country where people are more miserly. And there were some people who sat down into meditation and they really worked to find out what is beyond, and they have seen and they have felt and they have understood these things that exist within us. But you also, once you are realized you will also know that it exists, and you will see the pulsation, you will see the rising, you will see every chakra and you can feel it. All this will happen to you after little maturity, after your Self-realization. But you have to make it reflect. 

As I said that this is our evolutionary process, so it is a living process. You can understand a seed growing up. In the same way we grow up into our own manifestation, into our new awareness. Now a seed becoming a tree; do we ever think that this seed is going to become the tree? But it does. We take it for granted because we see it every day. It happens every day. So for us it’s not a surprise. But for people who have never seen it happen it is quite a big surprise. In the same way, this Kundalini when you will start seeing it, you’ll be surprised that it exists. It exists at that round spin place which is at the base of your spine, the triangular bone. You can see it pulsating. It is to be awakened. It is a residual force kept there waiting for your evolution, that is like a plumule, or what we call in Sanskrit an ankura. It’s the part of the seed that anchors itself in there. That is placed within you. It is there. It is existing. But here I have to tell you one thing very frankly, because I’ve read so many books on Kundalini, I am aghast, aghast. I don’t understand. Specially the foreigners. I can understand tantrikas doing that nonsense because they were definitely satanic. They wrote it because they were satanic; they were horrible people, sinful people. But I can’t understand westerners who have known Christ. To conclude that with Kundalini, how can that give you Realization? How can that be part of your evolutionary process? It cannot. But it’s [hoist/er or venture?] to believe, because that is one thing you can do. Awakening of Kundalini you cannot do. It is beyond. You cannot achieve it. It is beyond you. It is like a light which is not yet enlightened and it cannot enlighten itself by itself. Some enlightened light has to enlighten it. You cannot do it. 

So here clearly you can see the red spot is the spot where the deity for the, all these reproductive functions of human being is placed and is knows as Shri Ganesha. He is Shri Ganesha. Shri Ganesha is the Deity – embodiment of innocence. He is the One who was created long time and He came on this earth as Lord Jesus Christ. He’s the source. He doesn’t belong to you or to any Christian; He belongs to the whole world. He came for the emancipation of the whole world. If you think that Christ belongs to churches, He does not. You take it from Me. Neither Krishna belongs to temples, neither Christ. You just open your eyes towards yourself, towards your temple. You see, you have put up some clergy men upon [satan? /them]. Then you say, “They are the people in charge of Christ.” How can they be? How are they related to Christ? What do they know about Christ? You can  [read Bible/be in silence], you can interpret Him. What is their model before you? You have also people paid by you. They are your parasites. How can the parasites criticize you and say, “We are that”? But you do not want to think about it. Because we are members of a church, we’ve clubbed together; we want to deceive ourselves on this point. You have clubbed together, but you are a seeker. Church is not going to give you what you want. It is your own temple in your heart where Christ [has/can] reside. You didn’t know [it till now?] and that’s what you should ask for. That’s the thing, that you are the master of everything. And nobody can give you religion but your own. 

It is written in the Bible, in the Koran, in the Gita, everywhere. Those people who think they are in charge of religion are really misleading. Same about Hindus, same about Muslims, all of them. And a kind of a fanaticism that has spread out has brought down the whole conception of religion. And now what we find that young people are not interested in the churches, not interested in the temples, not interested in the religions.  Why?  If there was some truth in this, they would have been. But the truth is not easy [to find?]. They haven’t got it. They are there because you have chosen them. We have started a social organization. [We have been/You know I’ve been living] in this country where so many Christians are living such a sex perversion and such a horrid thing that is going on. How is it possible if the churches are punishing them properly on religion? They are not. They [are/have] most [illusive thing/delinquencies?]. I was Myself born as a Christian and I know what they are. It is not a [reward/word] about it, but understanding pure [sounds like “exclusive” (unclear)/witnesses] of the things they have been [initiated/ related] to. And the reason is [?], they do not know the truth. Neither there is freedom for a self-doer to think for himself. Your spiritual freedom is individual in all these so-called religious bodies. We know of our political freedom very much, with knowledge people, [we are very particular about/we have been very sensible about it]. What about our spiritual freedom? We have to see our spiritual freedom first of all. You think about it, think out of those cells, and now let us see what it is. If it is so, then you have a right to get it; you have a right to have it. But if you are in a cage how can you fly? How can your visions work out? 

So first of all is, when you are really [blessed] please free yourself from your – I would say ideas or you can say your misidentification; I call them ‘’mis’’. You can call them ideas. But just now you be yourself, and I will tell you what you have got [free/in] and face it. You must bravely face and see for yourself. All these churches and all these temples will have a meaning as soon as there is light of truth in them. They will have such a beautiful meaning to them once they accept the light of the Spirit. This has happened at the time of Christ also, as you know, and He was crucified by the people who had themselves [this on], who crucified Him. Then they threw stones at that time. And He said that, “I have come here to complete your work. I’ve come here to explain.” Still they crucified Him. And that should not be repeated again. So please see for yourself without denying. See for yourself. These are the centers, are placed within you. Now the lower portion of this red center looks after the reproduction and is presided by the Deity of Shri Ganesha who incarnated on this Earth as Lord Jesus Christ, and this Deity is the embodiment of innocence. 

The whole religion was created on this Earth, or in this Universe. It was holiness and innocence that was created. We have spoilt that joy by our mistakes, by our misidentification, by not understanding. You should not conclude, a religion is a holy one, is the, is the love. It’s not perverted. It is not destructive. It is constructive. Religion is the sustenance within us by which we become human beings, by which we become superhuman beings. Religion is the sustenance by which the carbon atom has four valences, by which you have ten [religion] within you which are described in the Ten Commandments. What happens to them when we do not obey? Then all our machinery goes out of order, all our being gets disturbed and because of that this happening takes time, much more than it should happen. As you will grow further in Sahaja Yoga you will realize yourself that it happens. It’s a living energy within you which rests at that point, triangular bone, and which rises. Then it is awakened. 

Kundalini awakening has been always conceived wrongly by wrong people. I was amazed how they take this. Oh God, they do not know anything about it. What are they talking? How can they tell such lies openly to people? How can they mislead people? There are people who are writing their [mandala?], this, that. There is some books on Sanskrit language, I don’t know from where there is something, and they put it in the book [what they did? (unclear)]. It has no meaning, no relevance to reality; take it from Me. It has no meaning. Then you will get your Realization. When you will get your Realization, when you’ll become yourself. You can decide for yourself whatever I am saying is the truth or not. I have to tell you, I have to tell you because it has [been/hindered] so much. You have been real seekers. You have been seeking not in this life but in many lives you have been seeking, and that’s why you are sitting down here. But before you’ve come to Me you have had lots of problems, you have had lots of misidentifications and lots of wounds are there in your Kundalini. I have treated your Kundalini with big, big holes. My compassion starts shivering within Me, starts [unclear]. It makes Me feel [itself/ moves/ you see it has] very gentle,  absolutely gentle and subtle, you see that, that Kundalini. It is so subtle. You cannot imagine what a mother feels when [such a] Kundalini takes place within you. I know you are seekers, I know you are My children, I know I have to give you, I know, and then I find you just [unclear]. So please, now do not play with yourself. Do not destroy you anymore. You have come to Me. And please, it is for your good. It is for your emancipation, for your salvation, for your evolution. You have to take your Realization, because you must know that there’s a short time now, very short time. In this short time you have to come up because the time has come for this creation to mature. The maturity starts now that blossom time has come. And in that blossom many have to know – those who will not be mature ? to know that the Rider is going to come for the last [record], for the last spiritual [ride]. He’s going to [start up] everything, but [He is so powerful/There’s no time for you]. He’s not going to be compassionate. He’s going to come with his eleven destructive forces; it’s described in all the scriptures whatsoever. So it is necessary, and that’s why your urge is also [unclear], urge is also to be felt and that’s why you want to have it. But some of you have spent all your energy in wrong things, like running after some falsie fellow. 

The other day I had a German girl ? she hasn’t come today ? and she told Me for months together, she was working for a guru. And she went there all the way to Germany. She went all over the places everywhere. She spent all her energy. She spent all her energy in this, in this [man]. And then now she’s so fed [out/up?]. She said, “Mother, thank God, I know I’ve found You but I’m so tired [of it? Unclear]. I’ve spent all my money. I’m a broke. I’ve divorced my husband. I’ve sent away my children. I have no energy left. I’m absolutely a broke now, absolutely finished. Now what can You do about it?” Then I said, “It’s all right. You’ll come round.” It happens. People are tired of that. So one should not bother. Everybody’s not that badly off and one is not that hopelessly tired, are they? At least you know I am there. I’m going to work day in and day out. For four years I’m going to be in London. I’m going to work it out for you, and it’s going to work out. But you must know that you must ask for reality and the truth. All the time for the truth. But it cannot be decided by your rationality but by your experience. So you must awaken yourself to the experience. [unclear] and [you should?] also have the experience and know that you are not insensitive but you achieve reality. I do nothing, and then you can achieve it. Some of you really take some time. You have some people here who took lot of time. They used to get vibrations, again lose it. Get vibrations, lose it. But it’s not that. You have to be fair. It is a [salvation/salvage], and even if somebody pulls you out then again go back, and  again pulled you out and again you go back. But calm down and put your [foot? /faith in it]. That’s how you can manage.

In short, I’ve tried to tell you that there are these seven centers within us. There is the Kundalini rising. And also I have told you that after Realization you get into a new awareness by which you can feel the collective consciousness. You can cure the centers of other people. You can cure your own centers. You start seeing yourself. Because of this happening your attention goes inside, and you see your Kundalini also rising. You feel a pressure, a gentle pressure working it out and you start seeing everything. You can cure yourself and you can cure others. Your health improves naturally because the vital force which works through your parasympathetic starts [fading] whenever you get to the mains of the vital force. Your baptism takes place, means your fontanel bone opens, which is called in the Sanskrit language as Brahmarandra. Means you open yourself into the Brahma, means the subtle, this subtle All-pervading Power of God [is Brahma/has come out.] And this [power?] opens into that and you become aware of that, by which you become collectively conscious. Sitting down here you can feel the vibrations of another person. Sitting down here you can cure people. Sitting down here you can awaken the Kundalini, but about Realization you cannot, because Realization has to be asked for. It has a protocol of its own; you have to knock at the door. If you think you are a great personality, Realization doesn’t come to you. If you think you have already found it, Realization says that, “All right, you go ahead,” but you have to say that, “No, I want to have it,” and you get it. You have to ask. You are to knock at the door. If you do not do that, if you’re not asking for it, you are at, look at it, absolutely free to it. You cannot be forced. You cannot have people mesmerize you about it. No, you cannot; absolute freedom. Even when you have got Realization you have absolute freedom to fall or to rise, because freedom is the thing that you have to have.  And how can you take out somebody’s freedom and give him freedom? You cannot. So the first thing that comes to you about [Christ/that], whether you want to have it or not. 

This is the first freedom that God has given you, to see right and wrong and see you are going to go beyond it. He’s not going to take away that freedom once He has granted you. It is throughout mental (?) and then the complete system, the knowledge and ethics. Whatever you know, you will be surprised that you will know it much more clearly, and that I will tell you that before [you know/ it works]. And then I will tell you, you will find it works. For example, when we have these five fingers here and five fingers here, when you’ll get Realization you’ll be amazed that from your hand a cool breeze like wind start flowing. This is mentioned in the Bible that the Holy Spirit emits cool breeze. You will start getting cool breeze. This cool breeze goes into you and will cool you down. It will cool you down completely. Your system will be cool, and then you will feel that from your hand also a cool breeze is flowing. Then you put your hands towards somebody like this, you’ll be amazed that person – maybe little burning on one finger, maybe little numbness on one finger, maybe little heaviness on another finger. Now when they are decoded, they can I tell you that you ask that person, “Is he suffering from this trouble?” The other day I met a lady. I said, “Have you got a liver problem?”  She said, “Ah, yes, how do you know?” I said, “Don’t ask Me. If you come to Sahaja Yoga I’ll tell you, because unless and until this happens to you, it has no meaning.” 

Now, how can you get cured? Because these centers are like this, and this is the left and the right sympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic is in the center but the limited amount of energy we have from the parasympathetic gets exhausted; then you get sick. But by Kundalini rising, the force that is eternal starts pouring into you, soothing. And it supplies, again they come back to normal. And that is how people get cured. [It the whole cured cancer people/That’s not going to be cured by other people], cancer can only be cured by only Sahaja Yoga, no other way. It is a simple thing which doctors do not accept; it is the over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system that causes cancer. Cancer came on this Earth since I was born. Because of the [rear sensitivity/real sense] they started taking to sympathetic activities. [Rear/ Sheer :UNCLEAR] of sympathetic activities creates cancer, any kind. Then we can say even a sickness can create a sympathetic activity. Then people say it is due to cold, cancer has come. It is due to rubbing of the nose it has come. It is not. It is an over-activity that has caused this cancer, and it can be completely cured through Sahaja Yoga. But first of all, you must get your Realization. Without Realization, you should not ask for cure. I mean, you are cured, no doubt. It can be cured, also by touching, it’s all right, but that’s not so important. 

You see, you’ll be surprised, there’s someone I’ve seen who has published about Me, I think in Tanzania and some places in ? I don’t know, East Africa and all that ? about how I have cured people and how I have done , and this is a very miraculous power and all these things. Thousands of letters are now pouring down here, saying, “Mother, you cure our diseases and cure this, cure that.” It is as if curing is the main thing. But there are so many letters who also come to Me say, “Mother, give us this.” So this is just a by-product. Curing is not the main thing. It just happens. Once you get it, you get it in a bundle, the whole thing. That is your physical being, [it works definitely?] because the vital force supplies the system of energy. Also your emotional beings gets absolutely settled because you become one with yourself. All your fears, all your, all your doubts, all your insecurities settle down because you know that you are [the Self/powerful]. Then you start [curing yourself/feeling cured]. You become a witness. The whole thing becomes like a drama. As if you are standing in the water and you are afraid of the waves. But once you jump into a boat then you start seeing the drama of that you [conclude/insight?] that [despite the human’s fan/you were trying to]  [Unclear] and you get [fed up/settled], you start seeing it. Like a witness, you have to be a witness. But by saying you have to be witness, you cannot be. It’s a happening. When it happens to you, when you become witness you cannot afford to be worried because you get the whole view of it and everybody, all these things pass out. 

On both sides of this hole, here that is the soft bone you have seen amongst children. Then you can see the ego and the super-ego are built, and that’s how our brain is covered like this, and you develop a feeling that, “I am X, I am Y, I am Z.” This I-ness develops. But when the Kundalini rises, it sucks from both the sides, the ego and super-ego, into these two channels which are on the sides, which are related to our subconscious and to our supraconscious. Supraconscious in the future side of it. But in the center there is a state; you can feel the state because you become thoughtlessly aware. You become thoughtless. To begin with you become thoughtless. You really become [blind]. You start feeling the silence. Then the Kundalini opens this path. When it opens this path, then what happens? The Brahma, the all-pervading subtle power that is divine love of God which is all over, is every part and parcel, in every anur as they say in Sanskrit language, in every molecule and atom, it’s pulsating, you become one with it. Once you become one with it then you start seeing. Actually, you lose all your so-called powers and you become the power. You become a part of that power. You become a holo-personality [GW: hollow personality?] and you start seeing the beautiful flavor, the melody of that power within you, and you start enjoying it. But [unclear]. It is their right to have it. You have to have it. But be prepared. You have to accept it. You cannot rationalize it. By rationality you cannot go into that unlimited place. It is a thing that happens. You just become that. What rationality brought you to this human state? You were amoeba; you became human beings. What rationality achieved that to become a priest? It’s a spontaneous status that works by God’s divine love. He works it out. 

You cannot even create one flower, but made of plastic, you can. But not one living flower you can create. The One who creates thousands of thousands of it, millions of millions of it, this beautiful [distant?] fragrant flowers of this Earth, the One who creates all that we see, the subtle that we see all around us, that beautiful human being that He created, so [wonderful?]. How can we say that we did anything? It is He does. And that’s why you have to leave the effort at this point, no effort. It’s just one. It’s just one. Even I do not put in any effort; you’ll be surprised, no effort at all. When we have to move later to put your chakras all right, sometimes your back bones are little [sticky?] or something has gone wrong. Or supposing some people have been dancing too much, or running too much or doing something to them, I had to put it little bit straight. Or they’ve been smoking too much, or drinking too much. I mean, they’re after their lives, you see. Some people run for miles together and this is madness, tell you. I know of an old lady who was eighty years old and she fell from a horse. Why did she do a horse riding? What is the wisdom? You know, all sorts of things, we’re after our lives all the time, after our physical life, after our emotional life, after our mental life and our social life. 

So respect yourself. First of all, respect yourself, because this is the temple of God. Respect your body. Respect your being, and achieve it. You have to awaken and achieve it; that’s all. It’s not in the details. I would not like to say much because if the details is too much, and sometimes it can be quite a headache. Like I would say, when I have to tell you about this room I can put off the lights completely and tell you, “Oh, it’s a very beautiful thing. It has a door. It has a red this thing, and it has that.” All those descriptions I can give you, and still I will not be able to tell you much and moreover, I may completely bore you and take you down. But I can put on the light for you and see for yourself. That’s much easier for Me and for you, and let’s enjoy it. Or if I want to put on the light I can just put the switch on, but there is a mechanism behind it. There’s a very big mechanism. Apart from mechanism there’s a history of electricity coming down. Since four years I’ve written a lot about [this/the spirit], and there is also a very big organization which is working it out. For one, putting the light it is so much. In the same way, in you there’s and behind you is a great army  of angels and great army of all the incarnations who [have go it/are working it out. You have had a big seeking of thousands of years when you were just a carbon atom or even before that just a lava from the Sun, and today you are a human being settled down here to know about your evolution.

Now the last step, it is very important and very vital for us to understand that so far you have not known your evolution, you have never felt, even you were not aware of it. But only at the human level you will know. That is the reason human beings were given freedom. In their freedom they’re going to know that we have definitely evolved. You have failed. You have gone [wrong]. We must get our transformation. If it is not [so/ that] all other works will just be talk, talk, talk, talk, talk and talk. We have to get our complete faith within ourselves [where/when] you become yourself. And that is the experience you should ask for. It has to be. It is invaluable. So you cannot buy it. You must rely on it. Anybody thinking on those lines, you must know that you are open to it, the highest of highest. Anybody who takes money, you must know, are the parasites. It’s so precious, so great, you cannot purchase it; you cannot. It’s more to it, very subtle and extremely sensitive and it thinks, understands to please you on a subtler level, not on a gross level. Then it will work out. Try to be on a very subtle level. You don’t miss it. It is so subtle that you won’t miss it. So be careful about it. It is for you. It is your own. You have to have it. So it’s not a shop, you see, the way people [ask/are], “Oh, I didn’t like Her lessons. So I’m going away.” That’s not that sort of a thing. It is not a shop. It is a salvaging process which is trying to help you out. It is there for you, for your seeking, for your fulfillment, complete fulfillment. And this is the way you’re going to be convinced about the existence of God and the existence of this Divine Power. And you are the people who are tomorrow going to turn all this universe into a different realm about which they have described, the Kingdom of Heaven. 

May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you.

Now, for the experience, can you close this [inaudible].This is a born-realized child, you know? It’s very great. [Unclear]. And one more thing I would [tell/say] that if you people come here, but you are not always informed about this meeting to get Realization, I know. But today somebody telephoned and somebody came and saw Me and said they were not informed. But you must know we are not collecting any money. We have no organization, nothing. Only we have a telephone number, where you could find out. We have it always on Monday at six o’clock. And the more you expose yourself with others. So you should come yourself, and try to come as many times as possible. As it is, you see, it is too much that everybody should write you a letter that, “We would like you to witness this ceremony,” and all that. You see, it’s not possible, and you must know that you must also show your own [hearts] to come in. So when the lady telephones and said that, “Mother, they have not informed us,” I said, “You should inform everybody.” No, none of them are responsible in any way less than you are. Everybody is responsible for themselves and for others. So you have to come yourself, find out yourself, and attend yourself and get full advantage of it, and you should join others also to understand. It is a wise thing; it’s a wisdom that should be with you, that you should do it in a way that you should feel responsible about yourself. So this is no excuse. Otherwise it is [steady]. These people might not have written to all the people possibly. Possibly, you see they are working very hard; they are about ten or eleven people who are working very hard. If you come forward and say, “No, we would like to help You. We can write some letters to people,” because there are some people who are very lethargic about it, you see. They’ll be very pleased if there’s a ball and dance, but for raising themselves up, to come up, [they are not ready?] you see. Because this is to be taught. This is to be asked for. This is to be found our. This is the joy, joy of the joys, the real joy. Nothing else is needed. 

So please put your hands just like this, now. Just like that. Now, why do you have to put your hands like this? It’s just because these are the antenna and [it works/ it’s working it out]. Just put your hands like this. Put your both the feet like that on the Mother Earth, [because that is as earth element?] [unclear].Take out your shoes, if you can take out your shoes. Oh, can you feel it? Really? Very fast. Close your eyes. Now just don’t think. You’re not thinking at all. If you see, you’re blind. Now enjoy this thing. This experience is the maximum, you see. First time that you get an experience is the maximum, because the Kundalini is so happy, that after so many years this thing [has got in]. Can you feel the cool now? Close your eyes. Just close your eyes. Close your eyes. Those who are feeling cool, just close your eyes. Just enjoy it in silence. Because the Kundalini is just rising, you see and touching your Sahasrara, and She’s so happy that it happens so spontaneously. Are you feeling the cool breeze? Not yet. Just sit comfortably. There is no need to sit very straight. Just be comfortable. Be comfortable. Be comfortable, in whatever pose you are. It will work out. 

Thank God, you see, it’s written in the Bible that you will feel it yourself. You must feel the cool breeze and the wind that is described. Still, it’s not easy to convince people. Very beautiful people [unclear]. Keep your head little open, your forehead, if you don’t mind.
