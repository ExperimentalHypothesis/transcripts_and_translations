Conversation with Sahaja Yogis on three songs, Bangkok (Thailand), November 8th, 1990,

[Conversation with Sahaja Yogis in English when Shri Mataji receives gifts.]
She asked Me to eat that fruit. I couldn’t even see. I didn’t know what to say.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

[Conversation in Marathi]

I have not eaten.
Jeanine: Shri Mataji, from all your children from Thailand.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no.
Jeanine: Yes, it is very small to thank you for working so hard. It’s collective present.
Shri Mataji: Why should you give Me now? I have not done much work.
She has already given Me one.
Jeanine: It’s a very small thing.
Sahaja Yogini: It's not big enough to thank you.
Prakash: Because once you lost your gems, Shri Mataji, in Bangkok.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
Shri Mataji: Oh, it's too expensive, I think. No, no, no. I can't take it, this is too much, too much. No, this is too much. You can't give Me such an expensive thing. No, no, no, no.
You give Me a small thing; this is expensive, I know.
Jeanine: We got it at a very special price.
Prakash: You know, normally we don't find this because it's a very traditional style, Shri Mataji. It was the only one we saw, and the price was not–
Shri Mataji: Exorbitant.
Prakash: No, not at all, Shri Mataji.
Jeanine Not at all.
Shri Mataji: Now, I calculated that one. It's very cheap, you see, now I have calculated it. When she told us for the price, she didn't give the receipt for that, you see, it was very cheap.
amount. We both of us calculated it; it's only two hundred forty-four pounds.
Sahaja Yogini: No.
Shri Mataji: Really.
Sahaja Yogini: Two thousand five hundred and forty-five pounds.
Shri Mataji: Two hundred. What?
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear]
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Five hundred and forty-five pounds.
Sahaja Yogini: Ah, yes.
Shri Mataji: Can you imagine? The receipt she gave is much cheaper than what she told us. The woman is really stupid. We were going round and round, and I was wondering how she was telling such a big price. And she just said so much of pounds. And I was calculating and telling her, but she would never listen to Me. I mean, I can take one, but two of them is too much.
Prakash: Shri Mataji, it was not expensive at all. And it's really from our heart.
Sahaja Yogi: Maybe just take a picture of them.
Shri Mataji: Taking the bribe, eh?
[Laughter]

This is really too much.
That was in ancient times, you see. Now it's different. That was a life, different life. You know why she threw her ornaments down? Because she thought Rama might come this side and recognize it. So when Rama came here, he picked them up, and asked Lakshmana, "Do you think there are the ornaments, do you recognize my wife's ornaments?" He said, "I have never seen her above her feet. I have only seen her feet. So I can only make out from the ornaments of her feet, and they are hers."
That's what Lakshmana said. "I have not seen her other ornaments otherwise. Only I’ve seen her feet. And the ornaments of her feet, I can recognize."

She has really blessed this country, I must say. Otherwise, we don't find these gems and things anywhere else, all these . You see, She is the daughter of the sea, you know. Mahalakshmi she is. So naturally, she has all the gems with her, from the sea.

All right, forget that part. So, you will have to bring it yourself.
Jeanine: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: I don't want to guarantee it for these horrible customs to eat Me off.
All right.
[Marathi]
Which one you want to sing? Where is Martin? He is a great singer.
Sahaja Yogi: Ganesh Stuti.
Shri Mataji: Hum. Ganesh Stuti
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]
Ne, first of all, give him the note. Svarga.
[Marathi]

[The Sahaja Yogis sing ‘Ganesh Stuti (Hem.ja Sutam Bhaje) ‘ Sanscrit 11]

[Marathi]

[About a song] Switzerland. They have composed it. Written and composed it. What a thing, remarkable! That is Hindi language. Can you beat it? I mean, it’s really remarkable

[The Sahaja Yogis sing 'Is. Liye (by Sanjay Talwar)' Hindi 25]

May God bless you. Wonderful. And if there is a little Ganesha needed, I would just do that, later on. [Marathi]
Cause they have done it, these boys have done it together. Sham and all these people. And, it’s little mistake but he can correct it.
[Conversation in Marathi about the words]

Sahaja Yogi: Marathi song 7.
Shri Mataji: Which is that one?
Sahaja Yogi: Ude, ude, ude, ude, oh!
Shri Mataji: ‘Powada’, sing better. ‘Powada’ is better.
[Marathi]
Sahaja Yogini: Which page is it?

Shri Mataji: These I have to see, these letters. What bout the letters that you have? I should read them otherwise. I have to read them.

[The Sahaja Yogis sing ‘Powada’. Marathi 16, recorded as 15 before]

Shri Mataji: It was written by one Miss Kulkarni who went to Chhindwara. And she met my cousin. He looked the same, with a different sort of a face, you see? And she felt that he was rather different. She asked him, “What is your surname?” And he told my surname. So, she asked about Me. He said, “She’s my first cousin”. She asked all about my family. She went and saw my house and then she wrote this.

[Marathi]

Any new song come up, the whole – [Conversation in Marathi]

Babamama sung this song when he had come to London, for the first time. And everywhere now, you ‘ll hear that song. It’s not yet in the book.
It’s written for a sister. This song is very nice. ‘Kadhi, kadhi’, is it ‘Kadhi, kadhi’ is it the name? No, no I don’t think so.
[Marathi]

‘Sainya Nikas. Gaye Mai Na Lari Thi’ That’s a Kabira saying.
‘Sainya Nikas. Gaye Mai Na Lari Thi’. [Marathi 57].
These three songs nowadays, you must hear mister Guido and compagnie.
We were going in the car and they said, “Mother this song, we want to know the meaning”. I said, “All right. Play it, I’ll write it down the whole thing”. Now they know it by heart. Sing it very well. That’s, the first one is very nice. It’s about a person who is a seeker.
[Marathi 45].

The first sentence is that:
‘Majitz. Hakk Maz.La Yete Kadhi Kadhi‘. Sometimes I hear myself calling myself.
‘Gar.Dit. Shoddh. Mazha Ghete Kadhi Kadhi’. And that call sometimes tries to find me out of the crowds.
The second one is very nice. ‘Andhar. Ved.Nancha Ghela Lutun. Chandra‘. The darkness of my pain, painful life, the darkness of my painful life has really looted the Moon, means the Moon is the inspirer of all the poetry. But it has also looted the Moon, it’s so much darkness of my pain of seeking.
‘Tzahul. Tzandanachi Yete Kadhi Kadhi‘. But sometimes, I do hear the footsteps or glimpses of stars. Though the Moon is lost to me. Moon, I cannot get inspiration from the Moon, I’m so much in the darkness of my pain.
‘Parkya Gharat. Mazhya Kaule Hi Sukhachi‘. In the dilapidated house whose footsteps I hear?
‘Hi Dhul Anganichi Gate Kadhi Kadhi‘ the dust of my courtyard sometimes sings.
‘Awaz. Ha Kunatza Alhe Kunitz Nahi’ Whose voice is this? There is no one.
‘Majetz. Dhuk. Ata Has.Te Kadhi Kadhi’. It’s my own pain that sometimes smiles.
It’s beautiful. Poetry is so nice. The emptiness of the hankering of the seeker.
[Marathi]
You have to be a seeker to feel the depth of this song.

And this one is of Kabira. This one is: ‘Sainya Nikas. Gaye Mai Na Lari Thi’. ‘ Sanya’ is here, is the life. But, you see, the people don’t understand. ‘Sainya’ also means ‘beloved’.
He says, my beloved, my life left me, I didn’t fight with it. I didn’t fight with it.
I remember only one or two sayings.
‘Meri Gar Na Na Mano, Saheli Se Puchho’. If you don’t believe me, then you can ask my friend.
‘Chadar. Oruk Palanga Pari’. I was lying quiet, covering myself with a sheet. I didn’t fight with my death when it came.
The last one is the best as far as you’re a Sahaja Yogi.
‘Rang. Mahel. Ke, das. dar.vaze’. ‘Rang. Mahel’ means this body, ‘Rang. Mahel’ means the palace of enjoyment; this body, the palace of enjoyment has got ten doors, ‘das. dar.vaze’.
‘Jane Kaun.Si Khir.Ki Khuli’. God knows which window was opened, means the Sahasrara. God knows which window was opened.
[Marathi]

[The Sahaja Yogis sing ‘Hasat. Ali Nir.mal. Ai’. Marathi 11]

Shri Mataji: Woah.
I hope you know the meaning of this song. He? You don’t know the meaning.
Sahaja Yogi: My mother come with jewels,
Prakash: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: [Unclear] it’s for Me to translate. "Smiling comes my Mother, wearing all jewellery". That's what he’s described there. Just before lifting the sari, this song was sung. This is also in Bhairavi raga, the last song. After that, they don't sing any songs.

It's a description of the Mother: what she is wearing, what sort of a crown she is wearing, all that dress. I don't know who has composed this one. I have no idea. Babamama ke?
Sahaja Yogini: Babamama.
Shri Mataji: Imagine my brother composed; I can't believe it!
It is really, dropped into the ocean of Sahaja Yoga. It's such a search. I'm surprised at it. His face has changed completely. So serene now, so beautiful.

So very full of joy. Always worried about Me.
So, thank you very much for everything. It has been a wonderful time and now we have some nice people. I wish you all the luck for following on. And I hope you build up very good Sahaja Yogis here. Once they are build-up, then you can have more. But, you see, in the beginning we shouldn’t have too many.
[Marathi]

[Marathi]

In London, they mixed up everything in full. Recently, they found out there are some sorts of a, you can say, glass, glass pieces. Just to finish one factory out of jealousy.
Sahaja Yogi: Really.
Shri Mataji: So many things they are doing in England. All the time, they are doing out of jealousy, things. So, I’m telling him that food is a very sensitive item..

[Marathi conversation]

Thank you very much for all the nice music, for everything.
At what time is the plane tomorrow night?
Sahaja Yogi: Eleven fifty.
We'll have to leave fairly early though.
Shri Mataji: What? Early means nine?
Sahaja Yogi: Nine is just in case.
Jai Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: So I'll see you tomorrow morning?
