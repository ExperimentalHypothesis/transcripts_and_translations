Conversation with Sahaja Yogis on three songs, Bangkok (Thailand), November 8th, 1990,

35:40Babamama sung this song when he had come to London for the first time. And everywhere now, you ‘ll hear that song. It’s not yet in the book [song book].It’s written for a sister. This song is very nice, you see. ‘Kadhi, kadhi”, is it ‘Kadhi, kadhi’ is the name? No, no I don’t think so.[Hindi]‘Sanyani...’ That’s a Kabira saying. ‘Sanyani...’

These three songs nowadays, you must hear mister Guido and compagnie. We were going in the car and they said, "Mother this song, we want to know the meaning". I said, "All right. Play it, I’ll write it down the whole thing". Now they know it by heart. Sing it very well. That’s the first one is very nice. It’s about a person who is a seeker. [Marathi 45]

The first sentence is that:‘Majitz. Hakk Maz.La Yete Kadhi Kadhi‘. Sometimes I hear myself calling myself.‘Gar.Dit. Shoddh. Mazha Ghete Kadhi Kadhi’. That call sometimes tries to find me out of the crowds.‘Andhar. Ved.Nancha Ghela Lutun. Chandra‘. The darkness of my painful life has really looted the Moon, means the Moon is the inspirer of all the poetry. But it has also looted the Moon, it’s so much darkness of my pain of seeking.‘Tzahul. Tzandanachi Yete Kadhi Kadhi‘. But sometimes, I do hear the footsteps or glimpses of stars. Though the Moon is lost to me, I cannot get inspiration from the Moon, I’m so much in the darkness of my pain.‘Parkya Gharat. Mazhya Kaule Hi Sukhachi‘. In the dilapidated house whose footsteps I hear‘Hi Dhul Anganichi Gate Kadhi Kadhi‘ the dust of courtyard [?] my sometimes seek.‘Awaz. Ha Kunatza Alhe Kunitz Nahi’ whose one is this? There is no one.‘Majetz. Dhuk. Ata Has.Te Kadhi Kadhi’. It’s my own pain that sometimes smiles.It’s beautiful, poetry is so nice. The emptiness of the hankering of the seeker.[Hindi]You have to be a seeker to feel the depth of this song.39:54

So very full of joy! You’re always worried about Me. So, thank you very much for everything. It has been a wonderful time and now we have some nice people. I wish you all the luck for follow ups and I hope you build up very good Sahaja Yogis here. Once they are build-up, then you can have more. But, you see, in the beginning we shouldn’t have too many.
