34:13It was written by one Miss Kulkarni who was going to Shivara. And she met my cousin. He looked, let’s say, [unsure] with a different sort of a face, you see? And she felt he was rather different. She asked him, "What is your surname? " And he told my surname. So, she asked about Me. He said, "She’s my first cousin". She asked all about my family and she went to see Me in my house and then she wrote this.

Babamama sung this song when he had come to London for the first time. And everywhere now, you ‘ll hear that song. It’s not yet in the book [at that time].It’s written for a sister. This song is very nice. ‘Kadhi, kadhi’, is it ‘Kadhi, kadhi’ is it the name? No, no I don’t think so.[Hindi]

‘Sainya Nikas. Gaye Mai Na Lari Thi’ That’s a Kabira saying. ‘Sainya Nikas. Gaye Mai Na Lari Thi’. [Hindi 57].These three songs nowadays, you must hear mister Guido and compagnie. We were going in the car and they said, "Mother this song, we want to know the meaning". I said, "All right. Play it, I’ll write it down the whole thing". Now they know it by heart. Sing it very well. That’s the first one is very nice. It’s about a person who is a seeker. [Marathi 45].

The first sentence is that:‘Majitz. Hakk Maz.La Yete Kadhi Kadhi‘. Sometimes I hear myself calling myself.‘Gar.Dit. Shoddh. Mazha Ghete Kadhi Kadhi’. That call sometimes tries to find me out of the crowds.‘Andhar. Ved.Nancha Ghela Lutun. Chandra‘. The darkness of my painful life has really looted the Moon, means the Moon is the inspirer of all the poetry. But it has also looted the Moon, it’s so much darkness of my pain of seeking.‘Tzahul. Tzandanachi Yete Kadhi Kadhi‘. But sometimes, I do hear the footsteps or glimpses of stars. Though the Moon is lost to me, I cannot get inspiration from the Moon, I’m so much in the darkness of my pain.‘Parkya Gharat. Mazhya Kaule Hi Sukhachi‘. In the dilapidated house whose footsteps I hear‘Hi Dhul Anganichi Gate Kadhi Kadhi‘ the dust of courtyard [?] my sometimes seek.‘Awaz. Ha Kunatza Alhe Kunitz Nahi’ whose one is this? There is no one.‘Majetz. Dhuk. Ata Has.Te Kadhi Kadhi’. It’s my own pain that sometimes smiles.It’s beautiful, poetry is so nice. The emptiness of the hankering of the seeker.[Hindi]You have to be a seeker to feel the depth of this song.

And this one is of Kabira: ‘Sainya Nikas. Gaye Mai Na Lari Thi’. ' Sanya' is here, is the life. But, you see, the people don’t understand. ‘Sainya’ also means ‘beloved’.He says, my beloved, my life left me, I didn’t fight with it, I didn’t fight with it.

I remember only one or two sayings.'Meri Gar Na Na Mano, Saheli Se Puchho'. If you don’t believe me, then you can ask my friend.'Chadar. Oruk Palanga Pari'. I was lying quiet, covering myself with a sheet. I didn’t fight with my death when it came.The last one is the best as far as you’re a Sahaja Yogi.'Rang. Mahel. Ke, das. dar.vaze'. I was 'Rang. Mahel’ means this body, 'Rang. Mahel’ means the palace of enjoyment; this body, the palace of enjoyment has got ten doors, ‘das. dar.vaze'.'Jane Kaun.Si Khir.Ki Khuli'. God knows which window was open, means the Sahasrara. God knows which window was open.41:11[Hindi]

[The Sahaja Yogis sing 'Hasat. Ali Nir.mal. Ai'. Marathi 11]

So very full of joy! You’re always worried about Me. So, thank you very much for everything. It has been a wonderful time and now we have some nice people. I wish you all the luck for follow ups and I hope you build up very good Sahaja Yogis here. Once they are build-up, then you can have more. But, you see, in the beginning we shouldn’t have too many.
