Puja, on the Republic Day 1982-0126

Shree Nirmala Devi ki Jai, Mata Nirmala Devi ki..Jai, Adishakti Nirmala Devi ki...Jai…...Mata Nirmala Devi ki..Jai.
 
Shree Mata ji: Before that I know that people think this time, this. But we have to go according to the auspicious time. Isn’t it?  Because to get maximum effect. So we have to start puja later. I also went for bath afterwards. So this is what it is. One has to understand that when you start the puja is very important.
[talking in Marathi]
Aaa... seventeen past eleven. I didn’t see this. I didn’t see this book.
Yogi: Uh this ah, this pratipadha is the first day of Navaratri...Maghi Navaratri we call which is auspicious week. So the first day starts at eleven seventeen and ends tomorrow morning eleven thirty three. So we are starting just in time.
Shree Mata ji: You see if you see a watch it would be all wrong because that is how I had to go for My bath also after [UNCLEAR TEXT pick up my clothes].
[in Marathi]
I never read this book, see this, see where they described. I know it is. So you can tally it also. You see it is easy to see the watch and walk. You see if you give up watch and do it in auspicious time half of your problems will be solved.
 
Again it’s a great day. It’s a day of our independence of this great country and also the national day of Australia. It is such a great thing to be independent and free. The worst thing is the slavery. Today we celebrate our freedom from that slavery that we had for three hundred years. But slavery does not go easily only by celebrating our independence day.  It has to go completely from our minds.  And one has to realize that we are really independent people now. We are independent it does not mean that we are abandoned people. Those who have not paid anything to achieve this independence cannot understand also the value of this independence. The slavery is in our mind still lingering on. Indians are now more westernized, anglicized than they were ever before.  Before independence as they had to struggle out of it they protested.  But when we became independent we started thinking that we should also imbibe all the bad qualities from the West.  So this is also a kind of a slavery which is very subtle.  Also the people who ruled us are still carrying on with the idea that (they are) still ruling us.  Is all imaginary. Both things are imaginary.  They don’t exist anymore.  As far as we are concerned in India, we have to know that this independence was granted to us through God’s grace.  We have won it through non-violence and truth, and granted to us, for us to achieve our spiritual ascent.  To become spiritually enlightened and find out from our root what truth has been laid for us.  Now we have to judge within ourselves as sahaja yogis, how much slavery is still there in our minds.  If somebody writes something a sahaja yogi is not supposed to believe it because now he is bestowed with the blessings of his kundalini.  He has his vibratory awareness to judge everything and see for himself that whatever he is doing, he is doing in an absolute way. Unless and until the country achieves its absolute freedom we have to still say that it is still under the pressures of slavery.  This time it may not be the slavery of other people but it could be the slavery of your own Shadripus, your six enemies.  We have to fight them.  In Sahaja yoga the greatest enemy now we have to face is our own ego.  Even when they get realization, even when they get vibrations, even when they are realized, they do not understand that it is all God’s grace that it has happened.  The ego stands in between and tries to give ideas.  This is the worst thing for a sahaja yogi.  Because now you have become a different person and you should develop a personality which can suck in more vibrations.  If you were not so Anglicized and if you had read about Devi Mahatmayam and all that you would have recognized me much more.  But because of your education you cannot recognize me.  So you have got realization.  Now better recognize me.  It is very difficult for people to take to truth.  Because truth, people don’t want to accept.  And this ego business comes in between you and your truth.  This ego separates you from truth and creates problem. What is the meaning of puja?  There is no need to think about it.  If your ego is less you can feel it on your hands, in your being and after a puja you will feel very much relieved.  But a person who is an outsider will think, this Mother is very ego-oriented. She wants to do..asks people to do Her puja..because they cannot feel anything out of the puja.  Only you who are realized and who are now settled down as sahaja yogis are the people (who) can understand what is the meaning of puja is.  But even among you I know there are snakes in the grass.  I know them, all of them.  But they will remain snakes all their lives and they will remain snakes even when they die.  One has to realize that it is for your benefit I allow you to have the puja.  It’s not very comfortable for me.  Its different if the devtas have to do the pujas as the deva because very simple people they are.  They know me too well.  The understanding is simple.  For them it’s a great pleasure to do the puja.  It’s a great privilege to the puja.  It’s a great blessings that they can do puja.  But to you it is your great ego which goes on telling you stories.  So some people who are still on that low level still continue with their low level ideas.  You have to come up a little to receive the blessings.  I have nothing to gain from you.  You have to gain from me.  Actually for at least three years when I started my work I didn’t want even to talk about Adishakti.  But if you want to talk about me to anybody don’t tell them what you have discovered.  We have an inner circle and outer circle.  And be careful about people who belong to the outer circle.  Do not include them in the inner circle.  They can never understand what puja means.  Only those who have come up to that point should be allowed in the puja.  You don’t have to pay for it.  You don’t have to exert for it.  Its only I exert.  But you have to receive it.  Some people will be like that. But you have to go forward into a dedication and understanding of Sahaja yoga.  In England, when I went there, I was very much worried about starting the puja.  So when the people came down here they saw that Indians were worshipping me and all that and they started the puja.  Still for people to understand that why my hands or feet should be washed with a particular type of a mixture is rather vague.  But for other Western people it is absolutely impossible to conceive because they have not known anything about the Devi.  They have not know a word about the Devi.  This knowledge is only in this country.  I think in Greece also.  In Greece people had this knowledge.  So once you have discovered a new source of Shakti (power) you have to understand that this is the way it has to be done. There’s a protocol.  This is the method, is discovered not by Me but by saints and seers.  It is the seers who have written down about Me.  I have not written down anything about Myself.  Like scientist they have discovered about Me what makes the Goddess happy, what makes all the deities happy.  They have discovered by using different methods, scientific research I should say or spiritual scientific ways they have discovered.  As young sahaja yogis, and new sahaja yogis you have to accept their verdict and you have to see what they have said works out or not.  And if it works out one has to know that it is only for your benefit and for the benefit of the whole humanity I am sitting in flesh here for you to do my worship.  I do not want to say anything which means claiming something or boosting or something.  Like when Christ said something they crucified Him.  You can’t crucify Me.  You can’t.  You try, your level best, you can’t.  I know that.  I don’t want to say something that will make your ego come up like a snake and hold a hood on your head.  This is the only consideration I have.  That’s why I don’t want to say much.  The seers have said about me.  Now you have seen the difference in terms and signs of a Goddess.  So to become purer and purer first of all allow all these negative thoughts to be away from your mind.  Any such thought comes into your mind you say no, not this, not this, not.  All these six enemies attack you through thought only.  There is no other way out.  First it comes as a thought then it can become a physical pain, it can become a mental agony, it can become anything.  But if you are in your thoughtless awareness then they cannot attack.  So try to develop your thoughtless awareness, in your meditation.  So this is the first step towards your freedom, liberation.  From these six enemies must get out.  These six enemies are still waiting at the doors and they will get hold of you.  Even if there is a mine of gold here and if you do not know the method, how to extract the gold out of it you will remain poor.  First you must recognize and then you must know the method -how to extract.  Thank God you are born at a time that most of the things are discovered about the Goddess and I don’t have to tell you.  It’s very embarrassing.  But those who have searched for you have already laid it down and it is better that you surrender your ego and take up their ways how they do it, and how they have done it, and what have they prescribed.
There language is not so important.  What is important is what they are trying to communicate.  They have given something great to you.  You have to give something great to your children, to your progeny.  And what are you going to give them?  There were very few people who gave such great methods and ways to you.  Now you have to give your progeny the witness, witnessing of this great Mahayoga, the manifestation of this Mahayoga that you have seen with your own eyes, with your own hands feeling it, with your whole body feeling it.  This is what you have to give to others.  This is the most precarious time and the precarious year.  In this year we can achieve a lot if you really understand at this moment the importance of getting liberation, of moksha that you have got.  You have to give mokshas to other.  By giving to others only your moksha will improve.  Those people who are still planning and trying to make you see a device or and an intrigue and all that is really working out for themselves.  They are going against themselves.  And these things are very dangerous.  As a Mother I would say that anybody who tries such things can affect seven generations in a family.  It’s not only in one generation this finishes off.  In seven generation it goes.  So after coming to sahaja yog, after getting realization you do not exist only as a angel which has fallen down but you become responsible for seven generations in your family.  So one has to be very very careful and that is why in the puja we do not allow people who according to us are not up to the point.
