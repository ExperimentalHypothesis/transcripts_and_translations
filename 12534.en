Conversation with Sahaja Yogis at Dhumal’s place, Rahuri, India, February the 5th, 1982

And I hope to come also. I hope to come because Nagpur is My mother’s place and all My brothers are there, you see. Then you’re coming back [Marathi] and it will be instead of reaching there on the fourteenth, fifteenth, you’ll reach there on the fourteenth. I don’t know what My brother has decided. You may stay for two days maybe, at Tarawa [unsure] it would be a good idea because it’s a very, very nice lonely place in a forest, maybe a good idea to relax and meditate. And then we come down to again to Warda. On the seventeenth is my father’s anniversary in the morning time, and evening time we take a train from Warda to Delhi. In Delhi, the program will be only till the twenty-fifth. But those who want to stay till the twenty-eighth can stay on because most of the people from Australia will go, and I think Delhi people will agree not to have any [prakta?] till the last day of my departure, because I don’t have to cope with the cold. Where, it’s where I was married. So, I have to go there also, maybe for one or two days. May be, may not be; I don’t know.

Whatever it is, I’m going to leave Bombay on the first to reach Perth. So, you please organize, the Perth people. And where I’ll be there for a day. One day it’s program...

Sahaja Yogi: To rest.
Shri Mataji: Two days’ program.
Sahaja Yogi: One day is to rest.
Shri Mataji: Two days’ program and then I’ll come to Australia. I’ll be there till...
Sahaja Yogi: Seventeenth.

Shri Mataji: Seventeenth, and then on my way back, if you want to come back with Me, Europeans can come and for a day at Hong Kong just for a rest. I may not have any program in Hong Kong, but just for a rest. And then I’ll come to Bombay. Maybe there I’ll be there for three, four days and I’ll go back to London. This is the program’s week.
So, I hope that in Australia now you will see that how people are working it out in Maharashtra and how far we are from them. Just see the distance. I mean, it’s too much, isn’t it? And where are we?

It’s a very dangerous situation. And the third war is about the break. Third war, third world war is just hanging on our heads. And it is the Western world which is going to bring in the war, not we, not the Indians. No, not at all, not the Maharashtrians. So, it’s a very dangerous situation, you are very precariously placed, and if people do not understand the value of Sahaja Yoga today, in the West, we cannot stop this destruction. And there will be a complete destruction. Of course, Sahaja Yogis will be saved, no doubt. And it’s so imminent and so vital that I mean, I don’t know if you can go on playing about with things and all sorts of nonsensical things.
So, you have to go all out, dedicate yourself to this and work it out that way. It’s a very big responsibility on all the Western Sahaja Yogis. It’s a very, very big responsibility which has to be worked out.

So, with your permission I’ll have some [diner].

The only difficulty is in surrendering. I mean, you do not surrender anything to Me. Actually, you take more. But the ego part is so horrible. Now, you can see this; you can see clearly. You see, one may think no end of oneself as, you may be great or whatever you may be, but in the eyes of God what have you been? People can’t get Realization the way they get here. It’s a fact one must accept.

So, in the relationship to reality and to God, what is the value of all these things? Nothing; zero. Of your achievements, everything, your ego and all that, what’s the use of having all that? Isn’t it? This is so, so evident, so clear-cut. Try to understand. You can’t carry your cars and your helicopters and your airplanes to God’s place. You have to carry your heart.

And if you could understand this, you see, then my job is done. It is you who are going to give them ‘shraddha’. It is you who are going to teach them how to respect Sahaja Yoga. It is you people, how much you respect is the main thing. So, get rid of your petty things. Whatever achievements there have been, are of no use inside, at all; they are outward.

It’s a very dangerous situation and people don’t realize it.
I’m not worried about India at all

Once I come back to India, it will spread in one year time! You have seen it.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: These people live under sub-human conditions according to Western standards. Just think of it. Just think of the joke. And everybody tells Me, “What about the poverty of India?” I mean, what is the worry about poverty? Nobody is dying out of poverty. They are healthier people. Not like many I have met in the West. Seldom, among so many, there was hardly one or two who were sick. Mental sickness is practically very little. Nobody is paranoid.

What do you say? Agreed? Now as your name is, you should come up. Hm? That’s a novel law lion [unsure]. [Inaudible].
He’s going to come up.
And in the West, they have lots of developments kings for Indians [Unsure]. And there are many who say, "We hate Indians. We can’t bear them. They’re no good, this, that!" And you have better telephones, all right. You have better communications, you have better train, better buses maybe, better hotels. But where are the Sahaja Yogis?

Most of it is advertising department. You told them the story about advertising department? Have you heard of the story of advertising department?
Sahaja Yogis: No.
Shri Mataji: It’s a very interesting one. One gentleman was a very good man who led a very good life. So, he went to Heaven. And when he went to Heaven, he saw everybody is meditating there, like Sahaja Yogis. He was amazed. He said, “I’ve been such a good man and here I thought I’ll have some enjoyment of life. Here everybody is meditating and enjoying the meditation. So, what sort of a reward it is?” So, he asked God that, “Let me go to Hell and see how it is.” [Laughter]
“Give me the choice,” you see, “I must have the choice.” She said, “All right, you go and have a look. If you like it you can stay on.”
So, he went to Hell and he saw outside- [Marathi]. So, he went down. In the Hell, he saw there were nice dancings, you see, all these that you have in England’s halls. And you see, an Indian was enamoured and was very happy to see all that. And they were all drinking, gambling. See, all kinds of things were on, in complete freedom, complete abandonment and lots of other things were also going on. He was very happy, he said, “Now you can enjoy here, no problem!”
So, he asked one of them, “Where is Hell?” He said, “You see through that peephole. You’ll see the Hell.” But there were many peepholes. From one peephole, he saw people were thrown into dirty gutters. Then he saw another one, they were being fried in the boiling oil. Then he saw third one where their hands, feet were cut. All kinds of tortures he was and he was shocked. He said, “What do you mean?” “What’s the problem? That is Hell.” He said, “Then who are you?” He said, “We are advertising department.”
[Laughter]
This story comes from my youngest brother, [Babamama]. He is ten years younger to Me. He is going to meet you there when you go to Tarawar. I hope he comes.

No wonder people are coming to India and they want to stay here. But as other governments have become very strict about visas and this and that, this government has also become, you see. And they are worried that people come down here and the villagers are, you see, hiding them. This never happens. Imagine: can this happen anywhere in the world, that the people living there are hiding them? They are against the government for treating the guests like this, you see, and without visa and other things. And that’s why you had that trouble about passports. Because there’s a big problem and through that lounge many sneaked out, you see, into the villages. So, the fellow was put into trouble. So that’s why I was very particular. But I think he’s quite upset.
[Marathi].

These are the people who are going to sing you songs in the praise of Lord Vishnu and other people and bhajans, as they call it. You know that. But you should see, it’s a very fast number, the whole thing is such a fast number, it’s a very- that thing is like that, it moves very fast. It’s a very fast number, you can’t even play it on the tabla, this ‘taal’ [rhythm]. It’ s only on this, is called as ‘pakhawaj’ [a kind of dholak]. It’s a thing; they call ‘pakhawaj’. Also, in Sanskrit it’s called as Mridangam, mridangam. This is Mridangam.

Are you feeling cold?
Sahaja Yogis: No, no.
Shri Mataji: What about your throats? Is it better?
Sahaja Yogis: Yes.
Shri Mataji: With the thing I gave you; better now.
