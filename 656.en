Conversation the day after the Mahasahasrara Puja. Rouen (France), 6 May 1984.

Gregoire: How can we better protect ourselves if we work in an environment which is against Sahaj?

Shri Mataji: That’s the place you have to work it. So it’s difficult. But whatever things you can grasp and think this is Mother’s quality, try to imbibe that within yourself. That doesn’t mean you start shouting at bhoots first.

So first, what is the first quality of Mother? That She came on this earth and She has worked for people who are nowhere near Her.

She stooped down to elevate others. And then gradually you can understand that this quality will take you to higher qualities than you think. So among the seven colors to begin with, I am the green color. Because I’m in the center. Green color is the color that you get it from the Mother Earth. So first you must establish the quality of the Mother Earth that she sucks up all the problems, gives you the best that she has. Start with the Mother Earth so you start with the Kundalini.

That’s how one should start imbibing. The pure Kundalini form of Mother is purity, is cleansing purity. But are you pure? Are you pure in your heart? Just think of that. And then, with purity you start. That is how you have to establish different chakras, of purifying all the chakras and ultimately when you are purified all of them, you have established Me.

Thus we understand we have to grow within and without by spreading our light horizontally now.

Only when you become like the deities your light will spread horizontally, otherwise not. That is what we say that somebody has got the siddha of a particular deity, is the siddha of Ganesha, is the siddha of Shri Krishna.

So first when you develop their manifesting outside powers, you see, of kindness, compassion, of witness and all those, then you can develop their other qualities, which are on the destructive side.

First the constructive side you must develop, then the destructive automatically will work, you don’t have to worry. Like one side of Shri Krishna he was playing with ordinary herds men and the another side he was killing rakshasas. So first you have to become like Him and then automatically you will get the other powers.

You don’t give swords to stupid people, do you? So one would understand that one has to develop these qualities of construction of all the incarnations and then you become empowered by the destructive qualities of those incarnations. If you understand the sequence, then the fanaticism will never grow because fanaticism comes when you start thinking that you are the incarnation or whatever incarnation has done, you can do.

Like Christians felt they could become Kalki without His Advent even and they took a rifle or you can say gun in one hand and Bible in another hand. And the Muslims, they never believed that Mohammad was an incarnation so they think, “Because he was a prophet but he was not an incarnation, so we could also do the same what he was doing.”

In the same way Hindus also when they become fanatic, they start thinking they have become great incarnations. So discretion must be used again that you develop all the constructive side of an incarnation.

So after the seminar you have to remember My word about it that you have to concentrate on a deity to imbibe the qualities of that deity. Otherwise you have no communication with the deity, and no use saying the mantras.

Like we would say that, “My this chakra is catching or that chakra is catching.” Why? Because there is that lacking of that chakra that you have not yet imbibed within yourself. So you must try to identify yourself with the qualities, the constructive qualities of every deity and that’s how you should believe that you are now correcting your chakras with the mantras. Otherwise I’ll find all the Sahaja yogis carrying all the thousand weapons of the Devi in their hands, suddenly thinking they have all become Devis.

Now I hope when you go back home, you won’t forget my words and try to concentrate on your pradesh, on your areas of different chakras which are not all right and which are troubling and try to imbibe those qualities.

And nourish, nourish also the ones that are all right by understanding the qualities of the deities. Then only you will be amazed that your powers will flow without even thinking about it. It’s not difficult for you. It is not at all difficult. But know that instead of paying attention to other’s chakras better look after your own chakras.

If your chakras are all right, you won’t even catch from others. Another dangerous thing people do is to correct the chakras of others. Individually it should never be done, collectively you may do.

But it’s better not to enter into that exercise till you have reached certain state of confidence. This is for your further movement into the second era of Sahaja Yoga.

And I hope I will live to see the second era fully.

Gregoire: Until the third, fourth one?

Shri Mataji: But first second one. You desire for the second. You cannot jump, you know. Now here you should today say to yourself that in your heart promise that, “Mother I will now correct myself completely for my own benefit and I will project my mind to think discreetly how I can help to propagate Sahaja Yoga to others.” With discretion – you should not go and talk to a bull about Sahaja Yoga.

Now for the leaders I have to tell you that consolidation is a very important part of the projection. I would say all the leaders must meet and decide specially about few things like tapes, now. Tapes are to be put into some place as bank. Put it in Switzerland, put it somewhere and that they should be distributed regularly, there should be a regular register of it.

Write it down wherever I speak where is the tape, how many lectures She gave.

Some of you should try to translate or to edit some of the tapes on your own and see how you have done it.

Send it to your leaders. Let the leader read it and then if he finds it all right, he can send it over to Me. So that we have a record also on paper. And also the sending of tapes from places to places is very important.

And must find out the people who want the tapes, should write to a particular committee for that, that you haven’t got this tape or that tape and if you get a particular tape, correspond about it with each other. Just don’t get lost. Correspond, “Did you see? Did you listen to that tape? Have you heard of that? What is this?” You discuss now Sahaja Yoga among yourselves. Write to each other.

Now the video tapes: whatever tapes you have, video tapes or any tapes, you better inform the central committee which will be formed of all these leaders here and inform them that you have got this tape and that tape and that tape. Make a list of that, send it over and revise it, put it right because they should not be lost.

All of you should try to think about the little problems of facing the propaganda. Like I would say that people may say what is so miraculous about Mother.

They are not realized souls. So what do you do? Now we can always keep the photograph where you saw the light on my head. And show them and ask them how do you explain?

Also you can … now there’s another beautiful photograph. Can you show them Arno? Arno has got a beautiful photograph where My whole hand has come like a moving sun.

All right, bring it up. You must pay him to get a copy for that and all of you one should keep that with you. There is another one where there is light coming out of My feet. Like that you should keep these photographs with you all of you, so that when anybody confronts you, you can show the photographs, “See now, how do you explain?”

In England, a discussion about Christ that a gentleman supposed to be very knowledgeable says, “Christ never existed.” Because Paul never mentioned it.

(Shri Mataji talking to one Sahaja yogi) Paul, I think you change your name because that Paul was a horrible fellow (Mother is laughing shortly).

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, how should he be called?

Shri Mataji: This now, we have to ask them, “But why do you believe in Paul?” You should write to all the churches, “Because you believed in Paul, that’s why there is a problem.” This is also some committee should handle that we have to blast all of them when there is any attack on Christ or on Me or anything, all of us must write immediately, “What do you mean by this?” Christ has said that “You are to be born again,” and Nicodemus said that “Does it mean that I enter into the womb of my mother?” So Christ said, “What is born of flesh is flesh but what is born of Spirit is the Spirit.” See the vibrations, you see. What about that? So, then you write to them that this Paul great was never a realized soul. So we cannot trust him, and the churches cannot give him up because their basis is Mr. Paul.

So you write to Pope and you write to this [NOT CLEAR, “Dharam”?] fellow and you write to all of them. And say that you cannot believe in that Paul, you have to believe in Christ. And it’s a very cowardly thing to compromise with the non-believers. You better write. Like that you will face so many things. But it should be a way all of you must react, all of you in collective way.

Gregoire: Who is going to write the letter? Please raise your hands. Who is going to write?

Shri Mataji: All of you.

Gregoire: To the Pope. The English to the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no. All of you should write to the Archbishop. What is the harm. And to the Pope and to all of them. Because this controversy has started. Gavin must be knowing the man who has started the controversy, the name of the man. Of course it is good, because it hits the basis of churches, in a way it is good. You need not mention Me. But you should not mention Me, but you should say, “Any sensible religious man can see this Paul is good for nothing.”

So the photographs were I’m in a simple dress, that is better to be shown than the one with the crown. Because it’s just their ego gets challenged.

Now there’s a funny letter, a thing, news, a pseudo-intellectual of India has written about Me, which I have brought to show you. Which is very stupid. She says that “We should be wise, not to touch the feet of a person who is just a human being,” and all that. Now is better to write to her about her wisdom is very shallow because she’s a pseudo-intellectual of the West. But if she knows anything about the Devi or about anything about an incarnation, it’s very easy to find out that Mother is the embodiment of Shakti. Because She has, we have seen, She has given realization to so many.

We have seen the pulsation of the Kundalini with our naked eyes, and that the cool breeze comes out of the head, and to deny it will be dishonest. Moreover Mother always, in India, says that it is better to give realization to people who are not over-educated. Because westernized education that they have had and they have not yet matured into it.

But we in the West are eighty percent educated people. Eighty [why?], about hundred percent I should say, mostly [cent?] percent. Or you can say about eighty or ninety percent people who are educated, very well educated, and we have found that through this knowledge you cannot understand Mataji.

Only the way you can understand is through some of the poets like Blake or you can say Khalil Gibran or some of the people or through the scriptures you can find out who Mataji is. But the best part is that the poets of India, the ancient seers of India, had given it much more clearly and when you try to test it with that you can find out who Mataji is. So first you better read these things and then talk about Mataji. On this line you all should write.

We have here all kinds of doctors, engineers, all sorts of people, educated graduates, this, that. And all kinds of people are educated people. But in India there are only about twenty percent who are educated in Sahaja Yoga, because all their education has been in the western language and western ideas that’s why they are still to grow into it. They have not passed through it, you see.

That’s what you should impress on them. And that to challenge our sanity or our wisdom is not very kind of this lady. Her name is Uma Vasudev. What a name she has! Does she know the meaning of Uma and Vasudev? You see, Uma is the Devi, and her surname of Vasudeva, actually the Goddess because She was the sister of Shri Vishnu. So her name is Uma Vasudev, and you can write, some of you can write a letter to her, care of Yogi Mahajan, that we have heard like this, that this lady has criticized Mother by saying that She allows people to touch Her feet. Actually She doesn’t want people to touch Her feet. But those who are realized are specially privileged people, they can feel the vibrations.

Has she heard of Pragyalok? Has she heard of anything like that? What is she talking? She’s just like an ignorant, some clerk in England. That’s what she is. And when you write the letter, you send Me a copy also, I would like to see. So now for all such attacks we all should act in a very collective way. And this will open the eyes of many in India because they think no end of themselves, they have just western education of a very low standard, and one has to cross the limit to become, you see, a Sahaja yogi.

When this western wisdom reaches its depth, you see, it reaches its depth then it starts seeking something beyond it.

That should happen, only it can happen to a category of people who have reached that state.

Otherwise it cannot happen to a person who read the books of economics, you see. So that is how we have to develop our attitude towards these people. And towards other people whom we want to get it, we have to know that they will be impressed by our behavior.

For example, I have seen people who try to organize programs also dress up in a queer way. That’s not necessary. Even Indian dress is queer to other people. So if you are organizing programs you don’t dress up like Indian people. You dress up like French, you can dress up like English, you can dress up like the way you are. So you should not appear to be strange to them. It’s all right among ourselves. But among the other people to impress them, you must dress up like way they know and understand. Because even the dishevelled hair they can’t understand. So you can go to a hair doer to get the hair done like some sort of a actor, doesn’t matter. You have to do everything for these stupid people and dress up in that way that doesn’t give them a shock.

Because you have to have the show to begin with. Otherwise they’ll never look at you.

A little abnormally dandyish. Little, little. That impresses, I tell you. You see, in the western countries I’ve seen people like aggressive people. They like people who are show-offs, little bit. So I’m not saying that you should, I mean, wear funny things absolutely like a stage actor, but you should look little bit more than what you normally are.

Sahaja yogi: Touch of class.

Shri Mataji: That’s it. Touch of class, you see. And I know it’s very simple. This country is like that mad you know. In England once I didn’t know that they appreciate real pearl so much. Actually I had one pearl necklace. And My daughter one day wore a chiffon sari with a pearl necklace that particular pearl necklace. And when she came back she said, “Take back your ‘madam pearl necklace'”. I said, “Why?” She said, “Today everybody was calling me Madam, Madam, Madam.” And once I was wearing an emerald ring I have, I mean with diamonds, you see, in Oxted and I went to a shop, and everybody’s eyes were popping out looking at Me. I said, “What’s wrong with Me?” I couldn’t understand. And actually one lady then asked Me, “Is it real Madam?” I said, “Yes, it is real. So what?”. So this is the trouble is, is so superficial attitude is that you have to be careful about it. But the seekers, you see, seekers are not so much impressed, as I always used to think, but is not so. Seekers are also … little bit [whinier?] of that they have.

That must be broken. I used to think that seekers would like to see people absolutely like a sanyasi baba walking, you see. But no, they like it in Indians not on you.

For such purposes we can use people like Bala. But he’s so smartly dressed always so, you see, you have to make him look like that, if you have to carry someone.

Now, so we have to come to an end of everything, and everything beautiful has to end up to start something more beautiful.

I’m going to travel in the second half of August, September, part of October to all the European countries. You all should write where you want Me to go. So all of you should write to Gregoire or to Gavin about what country you belong to and what places you would like Me to go.

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, would You like to do the tour at once or come and go, come and go?

Shri Mataji: First you write that, then we will sort it out. I can do one thing – say, for example, I go to Italy, go back to London, then I go there and go back to London, like that.

You see I think that’s a good idea is to divide it a little bit, will be better, and if you can’t pay for My ticket, it’s all right. Don’t you worry. No, doesn’t matter. You see, we have some money in the bank as it is and if it is finished, is all right. But if you can pay for My travel, you may pay. But if you don’t have, don’t worry.

But it’s better to keep it with gaps. And don’t pay pegs or regs or hex tickets for Me. I can’t manage that you see. It again puts Me into a pot.

All right. Now one more thing is the responsibility of the London sahaja yogis, because I’m in London, to see that I get all the visas in time.

Gregoire: You talk for the London yogis?

Shri Mataji: Visas, in time. All the London Sahaja Yogis have the responsibility to get Me My visas in time.

Gregoire: Thank you, Shri Mataji. I thought it was nice if You repeat it three times.

Shri Mataji: No, no, better tell openly, is better. Because I always forget that I have to take a visa because to Me the whole world is Mine.

So now, we say goodbye to all of you. You all have to go pack up, have your lunches and then you have to go. Please write to Gavin not to Me. Whatever you want to write, you write to him on his address, is the best. If you have to send anything to Me, any letter, put it care of Gavin Brown and get his address to yourself, all right.

Now, if you have any personal problem, you can come and see Me in My room. But not all of you. Those who really have. I would like to see Pamela for something, Pamela and her husband. And anything else, anybody has any personal problem raise your hands. All right. But not about your husband, wife and all that. All right. Because I have had enough of it. And I would like to meet Glenda and her husband. And that Austrian Sahaja yogini, the Austrian Sahaja yogini who’s come with him. Who else wants to see Me personally?

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, we have some presents for the French Sahaja yogis. After you leave we will do.

Shri Mataji: That you can do among yourselves.

Gregoire: So if you would allow Shri Mataji, we would now take Your mantra and You…

Shri Mataji: As long as you don’t have any more present for Me now, let Me go.

Sahaja yogi: There are presents.

Shri Mataji: All right, then you can give Me the presents and then say the mantra, all right. But bring it fast.
