Be Thankful to God; Count Your Blessings
 27th Jan. 1982, Solapur, Maharasthra India

[English Transcript]

In this Maharashtra, people walked miles together, singing the praise of Shri Krishna. They walked day in and day out. Some people walked for two months to come to this temple of Shri Krishna at Pandharpur. And you, too, had to do a little bit of that. So you can imagine those who must have walked day in and day out, sleeping in the open in between, where there could be a snake or anything, and then taking some food on the way whenever they get it, or maybe fasting. With great penance they come to this temple, singing the praise of God.

(Speaks aside in Marathi)

So, this penance you also had to go through. All the saints had to go through penances much more, much much much more than you ever have done or you could ever do. That was just to improve the quality of your life, quality of your life. If you live very comfortably, then the quality of your life is not alright. First of all, you do not understand the miseries and the troubles of other people. That doesn’t mean you break your head with some stones or some things like that, doesn’t mean like that way; I have to tell you the other side of it. But one should know what people go through. Through poverty. Also for achieving God’s grace.

And one of the things, I was sure that you’ll be reaching very late here; and I told people that no use making food for them, but I just kept quiet because, this was the thing was, there. But in any case, being Sahaja Yogis, you must have enjoyed it. And we have organised a program by which you can go and see a temple — which was really my great desire to build a temple like that, which will take about three hours, they were saying. The [temple] of 108 saints who were born on this great land of Maharashtra. And they have made their statues. Maybe one or two may be wrong, I don’t know, but most of them are there. All historical ones are there. So, they have arranged your visit to that place, which you should see.

Quality of life has to be improved. By not showing off; it’s not a showing-off. You see, the cunning of the ego also can be only improved if you go through some hardships. Ego can be very much corrected through hardship. Because we are so much used to comfort and self-indulgence, our ego is always supported. And, “I don’t like it, I like it” we decide on two points, which is a very wrong thing. So to improve the quality of life one has to go through troubles. People very easily in the West say “I’m fed up, I’m tired.” I mean, they don’t even think that saying this will hurt another person. Very common; I mean, I was myself amazed. Or, even to say “I hate you” is very easy, that the tongue is not educated properly, the tongue is not educated.

So Sahaja Yoga is the new religion, in which your eyes, your nose, your ears, your tongue everything, all these organs  are educated, taught  to say things, to hear things, to see things that are genuine, sincere, beautiful, and divine. If we could develop such organs, we will be the best Sahaja Yogis.

Also, one should not complain. Anybody who complains is not a Sahaja Yogi. Your mother never complains. When I’m tortured by people, you know that , I never complain. So you should also not complain about anything. For physical comfort to complain is the baser thing. But even for other things one should never complain.

Be thankful, count your blessings one by one. The best way to understand it is that we are the gainers in Sahaja Yoga. We are going to gain out of Sahaja Yoga. So, there should be only thankfulness. Thankfulness towards God that he has been kind to give us these things. That is the main thing. If you have that thankfulness, you can bear up all kinds of troubles because it cushions you up, gives you a cushion. And you won’t feel it. Once you are in that ecstasy of thankfulness, you will not feel anything. Even the thorns of life will not touch you. So get to that ecstasy, it’s such a great protection, it’s such a great pleasure, it’s such a great blessing! Get to that ecstasy of feeling how God has been gracious.

You are one of the first Sahaja Yogis from various countries. Maybe after ten years or so, the other Sahaja Yogis may not have all the pleasure of travelling by buses. May not have all these troubles that you have had. Maybe that they might get an air-conditioned, beautiful, what do you call, a bedroom, attached bath sort of a place, maybe, I don’t know how they change all that . And they won’t have this kind of variety or anything. But you are the foundation, so you are to be beaten up properly into proper shape and brought out to that level that you can withstand all the ............... and all the problems. Because the newcomers and poor-quality people can only be sustained by people of strong qualities, loving qualities, beautiful qualities. And the quality of life is the purpose of this trip. So, if you still have ideas of your comfort and all that, you better leave them in Switzerland, in Paris, and in England, or America. Here you have come to take up in yourself the discomfort of life. Thousands are living like this, in much less conditions. Why are you so privileged to have all these comforts of life? Why should you have all the comforts of life? Even Roosevelt has said that “Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere.” In the body, if there is one place which is sick, you all have to suffer. So is best in collective consciousness to feel that pain, that trouble also.

They have some other blessings. They have the blessings that they are not complicated; they are very simple straightforward. They are not complicated people at all! They are very simple straightforward people. They are poor, maybe, poorer, but they are very rich because they are so generous, they’re so generous! Maybe your health is better, but they look healthier. At least they manifest as healthier people. They work much harder than you do; they can withstand much longer the effects of hardships.

So, we have to understand that, as Sahaja Yogis, it’s ever our duty to improve the quality of our life, to see to things which are subtler, achieve that subtler being within us. To be that subtler being, we should forget about the gross things. Gross things does not matter at all! If the attention is still on the gross, the quality will not come up. To become subtler, give up your complications. Too many complications! Psychologists have given you ideas, everybody has given you ideas  and it’s all settled down in the head. Most of it is falsehood, is not the truth. Because nobody has talked about Brahma, nobody has talked about reality. So give up your complications, your fears, your troubles. Just know that you are the spirit. And the spirit doesn’t suffer. Doesn’t suffer. If you feel any sufferings, then you should say that it is not the spirit.

So the quality of life has to be improved on this tour. And they are all sorry that you suffered so much; I mean, they are much more suffering because of that, they thought that you suffered so much.

So today is another day of the pujan, and now the time has started. So, second day has started of the nine days, so we can have the puja.

In India, they have restricted very much. Unless and until people have achieved the state of doubtless awareness, people don’t allow them to touch My Feet, even to wash My Feet. They are very particular. Unless and until they have reached the state of doubtless awareness. At that stage only they allow, while you people are specially blessed because I allow every Dick, Tom and Harry to come to the puja. Which is a mistake, I know, because it creates problems. So one should understand that here they are very particular as far as the puja is concerned. They don’t allow any half-baked person to come to puja; if there is slightest doubt about a person, they just tell him, “You are not allowed.” Then the person works it out for puja, that he should become capable of coming to the puja.

While in London or all that, if I say, “Don’t come to puja,” they will think it’s a very good thing; I mean, they will all disappear in the thin air. Only through puja I can capture some people, but some people react, and it can be very dangerous. So all this dangerous game that is there in the West is against Sahaja Yoga. And as it is, in the West it’s very difficult to establish Sahaja Yoga, very difficult! You know the reason. very very difficult! Here you have seen thousands and thousands of people are getting realization. The time I am spending in the West, One day spent there. I can give thousands of people realization here.

So it is more for you to develop wisdom and sense of responsibility. Because it’s a very difficult place, West is. And if you do not want to make it a waste, then you must realise the responsibility that you have.

Still, the West is in the program of Sahaja Yoga. I never thought I will be able to live here. But somehow it happened that I got to the West. People are seeking, no doubt. But the seeking is a fashion. The genuineness of the heart you cannot feel also much because the ego is covering it. Those who have felt it are really, are gems. Actually gems. They are a really lotuses born in the mud, I could say.

The quality of understanding of divine life is very poor, and dharma is also very poor, we’ve seen it. I mean, it is so. So the responsibility of a western Sahaja Yogi is much more than that of Indian Sahaja Yogis, to keep the life very pure, simple, and dedicated. Is very important!

While the whole of India I can manage single-handed; I really don’t need Sahaja Yogis there, I can tell you. But if you ask Me about the West, and all sorts of things they do; I mean, all sorts of tricks they will play, everything they will do to trouble themselves. There’s no end to it. So, one has to understand what sort of lot you are facing; I mean, it’s like nark, it’s like hell, the way things are there.

Just open your eyes and see for yourself. Now you’ve seen these simple villagers, seen these simple people. Today I saw some boys coming on my Feet, about 14 year, 18 year. See, their Kundalini is just like a big river, just like a plain big river, nothing, no obstruction, nothing! No complication at all! Even old women I have seen! Giving bandhas to themselves so sweetly, you see them.

So the responsibility is much more, much much more than this villagers. So, be subtler. Do not complain. Develop your subtlety. Develop your love, your heart. Open it.

I mean, West may be rich, agreed, they are rich, everything is there, you’ve got helicopters, this, that, everything. Aeroplanes. Everything outside. Inside there’s no riches. They are poor! Doesn’t matter. So the more you care for riches the worse it will be. So forget that part and become dedicated to your inner quality of your spirit — which you are! You are gems, as I told you, you are gems. But we have to increase, we have to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

It’s so difficult, that, imagine, in a temple we had a program, can you think of one church where I can hold a program! In this, at least ten years to come. Can you think of any church like that? (Laughs) Such dumbfounded people! They have no idea of divinity. Even Christ comes before them, they will keep him out of the church. They’ve no sensitivity, they are insensitive people. So your lifestyle, your quality has to improve much. And you have to take really yourself to task for it. Be kind to yourself, be nice to yourself. But do not indulge.

I’m sure great people will be born in all the Western countries; definitely, I’m sure. very much. And they will really substantiate Sahaja Yoga. But you should prepare yourself to give them a complete support. All right?

May God bless you!

[Marathi to English translation]

Shri Mataji: Now you have already heard what I have said to them (foreign Sahaja Yogis). However, even though you are being praised a lot, it should still be understood that in our Hindustan also, there are many different kinds of things. Which tie us down. They do not have faith and you have blind faith; the first thing is blind faith. This blind faith has to be fixed.

Now suppose Shri Mataji says that suppose, do not wear black - then everyone comes down on Me with sticks. “Why, Mataji?”.But why do I say this? If I forbid something then why do I do so? I do not simply say it. Wearing black will create trouble, do not do it. “No, Mataji, we will do this also and that also”. That will not be allowed. You cannot have it both ways. If Sahaja Yoga has to be practised, it should be practised in its pure form.

They are lacking in faith but you have blind faith and you are obstinate about it. That is not alright. Now we say “yuga dharma”. This means, in this yuga, we should practice Sahaja Yoga “dharana”. We have to do “dharana” (concentration). For this wisdom is required. If there is no wisdom, (you) are stubborn, then nothing can be done. There should be no obstinacy. You have to see if what Mataji is saying is coming true or not.

Now you have experienced it, felt it, have felt the vibrations, it is written in the Devi Mahatmyam, you have seen your Kundalini rising at Shri Mataji’s Feet, then that is it - why should I tell you any more? If this is the actualisation, then it must be understood that what Mataji says has to be followed. Sahaja Yoga has to be practised as told. If you do not practise what is required in Sahaja Yoga, then it will not grow within you. If it does not grow, then blame Mataji that, “Mataji, we are doing Sahaja Yoga for so many days, but Mataji has not helped one bit”. It means you have not been practising Sahaja Yoga properly.

There is something wrong somewhere and it must be looked into. If you find out what is wrong, then there should be no stubbornness, no obstinacy. Obstinacy is a special quality of Maharashtrians. Be stubborn about every small thing, “I want it like this only. Do it like this, or not at all”. But it is not like that. You should see for yourself what it is, have wisdom. And take what is there.

What the sages and saints have said, we are saying the same. But where do you follow the sages and saints? Just have pulled out something with your own mind. Whatever has to be conjured from your minds and whatever you have done with that, that has harmed our country. Now I have said a hundred times that do not go to these “babajis”. They are tantriks, they put bhuts in you. If the tantriks go from our country, the poverty in our country will also go. I have said this a hundred times, “If the tantrik among you goes away, then the Devi will be able to come here”.

Because that is the principle of Laxmi - that if the tantrik comes in from here, then She leaves from the other side. So do not wear (so-called) holy threads, do not wear talismans, do not bring in tantriks. Then when poverty strikes then say, “How did this happen, Mataji?”. Krishna has said yoga gives “kshema” (preservation, the protection of God) but for that one must know how to do yoga. It has been said first yoga, then kshema. Not kshema first.

When one attains yoga and enters into the kingdom of God Almighty, then God gives His blessings. But have the ability to do yoga first. There is too much obstinacy about yoga. And this obstinacy causes a delay in everything. This is not the time for delaying. At this time, the faster that Sahaja Yoga is attained, the faster that you grow, the speed at which Sahaja Yoga dharma spreads - to that extent we, our country and the whole of humanity is going to benefit.

If this is understood, then man will be immediately, “What Mataji has said, we will do that only. We do not want to do anything else”, like that. Now everyone is like, “We are not bound by anyone. Why should we do it?” Then don’t do it. Tomorrow when you suffer, then you will come back to Me. Now if the doctor says, suppose, it is established (someone) is a doctor, Mataji has given you realisation, that is established. Now if this is proved, then what Mataji says is true.

I have said again that you check vibrations and do everything. If someone says, “I am great”, by saying that one does not become great. You may be great in your own steed. It should be seen if someone is great in the eyes of God - that should be seen through vibrations. Nothing should be given acceptance without checking the vibrations. Now we have had so many sages and saints. Out of them, some are false and yet they are still worshipped.

Now this Gajanan Maharaj. This man is not true, not true at all. You just see the vibrations, the whole body feels like scorpions are stinging at the sight of this man. One who is true, the Akkalkot (Swami) is true. He is true. That Upasini Maharaj is false. Sainath was very great and true. But the one who has come above him nowadays, the one who calls himself Satya; he is not true. Means what is, is, and what is not, is not. One must think, why would Mataji call some are good and others evil? What is My relation to them? With the true ones only, not with those who are false.

Now if I do not say this clearly, then who will? If Mother does not say it clearly, then who will? Many say Mataji inquires too much. There is no inquiry, I can tell you. Now suppose, a mother sees her son is walking into the fire. He cannot see, he is blind. She will tell him, “Son, do not go there. There is fire there”. First, she will tell him with love, then make him understand; will try everything. Even then, if he burns himself, she makes him all right. But why burn oneself? One must look after oneself. How will it work if one burns oneself?

The second thing to be also said is that regarding money, there are so many greedy people here, who are all making money in the name of God. Earn lots of money and consume it. Get money from others and live on that. There are many such people. One should stay away from such people. In Sahaja Yoga, if anyone shows such greed, then they will suffer. I know, people have suffered horribly. Their seven generations will not prosper. So they should not scam money. That is one thing, but they should also not go to people who indulge in such activities.

Now, the other day we went to someone’s place. He is a Sahaja Yogi. He had brought in some “guruvarya” for the havan. I said, “Why him? He is not realised. Is anything from him going to reach Me?”. I said, “You must sit (for puja)”. “Oh, we are not Brahmins, we do not know anything. Nothing”. “If you sit, it is alright. Not him. Even if you do not know anything, I will accept it. If you just give an offering (to the havan), I will even accept it. But he is not acceptable. Because he does not know anything. He is just greedy”. Such self-centred people cannot offer Me puja.

The person should be pure and realised. Sahaja Yoga means divine, absolutely divine. And in that divinity, you should receive the divine. You should attain divinity within yourself. For this divinity, absolutely like the way gold is heated in the fire and the way it absolutely attains its lustre, the same should happen with you. Then it is Sahaja Yoga, otherwise what is the benefit out of it? “Sahaja Yoga means just like other things work, people just follow, any odd business, religion, propaganda, this, that” - you must not do all these things. You have to be shaped into something special.

Whatever your situation is today, or whatever it is, that should all transform and something special should come out of it. Just as we cut facets into a diamond, in the same manner, your different facets should be shaped out. If this happens, only then Sahaja Yoga will have meaning, only then will I call it Mahayoga. Otherwise, what is the point of such a Sahaja Yoga that, “Mataji, we received food, we got this” - what is the point of all this? I do not find anything special in that.

The other thing to be said is that there is some (attitude) of “me and mine” in us, to an extreme. Abroad it is, “I have no son, I have no daughter, I have no brother, no one is mine”. That is the attitude. “I am everything”. Here, if they come to Me, then brother, sister, mother, grandfather - I should see to all of them. Now they have come to Me, whether they have received realisation or not - there is no thought about that. Now his brother’s, sister’s relative’s, so and so passed away. “Mataji, you should have looked after them”. Yes, agreed, but where were they? So, “They are mine, they are mine, they are mine” - not like that. “Maze soyarika kon, je Vithalache” (my relations are those who belong to Shri Vithal). This should be remembered.

Those who are related to Vithala (God), they should be your relatives. What is the use of troubling about others? If they are not in Sahaja Yoga, if they have not even attempted to attain God - then having such relations, even if they are related due to some links from a past life - then worrying about them, having some faith in them, needlessly, is of no use. And a man who keeps such faith is going to suffer.

The other thing that must be said is that I am very desirous of visiting your homes. Visiting you makes Me very happy. Spending time in someone’s home, with their family - and if you invite Me, I say I will come also. But it must be remembered that Mother does not have a lot of time. If you ask Me at that time, I cannot say, cannot just cut you off and say I cannot come. But where does Mother have so much time? People start visiting from the morning and in meeting (them), one cannot go anywhere else. So please do not feel bad.

Which is My house? My house is your house, is it not? I am there. If I come, well and good, if I cannot come, well and good. One must think like that and not feel bad about these things. Mataji has so many things on hand, it does not matter. “She must visit my house”, this insistence is another type of “me”. And then the wisdom goes out. Do not feel bad. Just today I had to go somewhere and I could not. I did not like it but what to do? Then you should say, “Mataji, you must not feel bad, we know you are busy. You do not go anywhere else. You spend all Your Life for us”.

Now I have My own family; I leave everything and live here for three-four months. Going to Australia, going to America, at least for six months of the year, I stay out. My husband is there, My home - will you leave your home and family and stay for six-seven months? Anyone? How do I do it? So, once in a while, give Mataji a holiday - there should be no objection to that. And do not feel so bad about it.

Now, these things that are there - the sages and saints of ancient times would not go to anybody’s home. It was their rule. And in Sahaja Yoga, I too have this rule, more or less. Not go to anybody’s house. If I go to someone’s house, another will say, “Come to my house”. Then they say, “Mataji had come to our house” - that becomes a thing of importance. Some people don’t say it, some people say it.

So, as far as possible, I have a rule to not visit anybody’s house. As far as possible, not put everything on one person. Now Petkar is there, then our Damle. Now one of them lives in Pune and the other in Mumbai. Now, in Solapur, until something is established for Solapur, then they should manage Solapur. Then the people from Solapur should manage. They should take responsibility. This is how we do it in Sahaja Yoga.

It is not that (only) these people should come and look after the organisation. Now it is put upon them; they will look after it. Slowly they should set up a centre nearby. Until the centre is established, they should look after it, then they should give it up. One should not be glued there - “I have established this centre, now only what I say will be followed” - one should not hold on to it. Wherever a centre is to be opened, do that. Establish a handful of people there and leave it; return to your work.

Again, open another centre, once that is established, establish people, prepare a handful of people - “Now you manage it, we have shown you, now do you do it”. This is how the tree is going to spread out. In this manner, you have to take everything with understanding, with love and without feeling hurt. Feeling hurt here means the kind of offence that is taken here by wedding parties - but you are neither from the groom's side (who get their way) nor I am from the bride’s side (who comply).

My situation is such that I am always from the bride’s side. Always having to catch someone's feet. So Mother should not have to do this. One must understand that whatever Mother does, She is doing it for our benevolence. And She is our Mother. Whatever we ask for, She will give us that. Whatever it is, is all yours. It is your right. There is no doubt about it. Even so, how to use one’s right, to what extent and when exercising it, we have a right over Mother, but not just us, others have a right too. It is all for everyone.

Where there is complete surrender, they will get all from Mataji. Understanding this, one should stay in the collective consciousness. “I am great or you are great. I will get fruits for Mataji so I have become great, or you got the mats for seating, so you have become great” - if this is your thinking in Sahaja Yoga you will not progress, instead, you will lose out. Therefore, you should not suffer a loss.

Just understand all the rules and regulations of Sahaja Yoga. These rules and regulations are laws of the Divine. If you observe them with love - not with anger, I repeat, with love - with understanding, if you observe them, then you will grow into trees, big trees. And you yourself will become very capable and strong. And all this power will start flowing spontaneously within you. And I do not have to do anything.

Now in this manner, we have come to Solapur. Next year, those who are from Solapur should make arrangements as per the program that I will outline and send. If you decide on the program that I outline, everything will be organised in a second. But if you start bringing your own ideas in the middle, “not this way, this way”, then there will be problems. Then to say, “Mataji, this could be arranged and that could not be arranged”; like that.

Because My attention is on you as per the program I have outlined. Whatever I send in writing, you should accept that. And see, that I will arrange it for you; everything will be done. Money will be arranged, you will not suffer, nothing will happen. But if you try your own arrangements, then there will be problems. If this is understood and you have this understanding, then you will become famous throughout the world. Your name will become known worldwide.

“These people of Solapur are so special, what they have achieved, they have given realisation to so many people. This one is special”. Now Dhumal is known to everyone in the town. Because people are wise. There is wisdom. Earlier, Dhumal also had some ego for some time. He got rid of it. Now there is wisdom. Ego should be removed. Now there is not so much obstinacy. So anyone should look at him and improve themselves.

Being demanding or stubborn, sitting over someone else's head, and so on; all these types do not suit a Sahaja Yogi at all. On the contrary, the more he comes up, the more humble he becomes. This is his identity. I never force anything on you. “Do it”, I don't say that. (I) Accept whatever is there. Whatever you say. Place where you want it to be. Keep with you or keep outside.

If you say sleep on the ground then sleep on the ground. We do not impose any force on you. So you, too, in the same manner, humbly, lovingly. You were born at the time of such a great work of God, you are doing such a great work of God, not only that, but you have been so successful in that work, how much you have received. What the great sages who have practised for thousands of years have not attained, that you have got.

Who has received this fortune? With this in mind, the humble person should pay close and loving attention to himself and to others. My wife should get importance, my wife should sing, she should be the one to flaunt around, if you do such stupid things, then that wife will start dominating you. So Sahaja Yoga - one should be very careful, it should be understood. Sahaja Yoga is for the whole world, not just for one or two. And in all that world, you can be like diamonds in a special facet.

Otherwise, just like we remove something, sweep it away, it can happen. You decide what you want to do with it, I cannot. I do not know. That is for you to decide. It is up to you to judge. I can't judge that.

So there should be no objection to starting the puja now. Exactly twelve o'clock, as I desired.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji has expressed the desire that all Sahaja Yogis from here sit in front for the puja. Those whose names I call out, the ones I know, those people should come forward.

Shri Mataji: Let everyone sit. I see there are not too many.

Sahaja Yogi: Mr. and Mrs. Bawale, come forward immediately, Mr. and Mrs. Chite, Mr. and Mrs. Joshi. Then Kalidas, Maulikar, Madhumitra Vakri, Ashok Tambekar, Mr and Mrs Tambekar.
