So as I said, at the very outset, I again ask your forgiveness for this hall which is again for all, smaller inside.
Now, at the very beginning, you have to know that I’m your Mother. I can’t tell you lies, I can’t, sorry. But I don’t want to hurt you either or to make your ego stand up, so that you loose your chance of Realization. I have to do it very carefully because I know you are delicately placed, perhaps you do not know that your situation is precarious. In your naiveness, you have reached sometimes a place where you’ll just drop out. You have read a lot without knowing anything about what is the problem. It takes nothing to print a book in India. And these days, it is a very prosperous industry to print books. I’ve not printed any book of My own.  Gregoire has written a very big book but that we don’t give it to people who are not yet Realized fully, because you have to be prepared, developed and mature to sustain the truth. If you do not accept the truth, it will come through, but it will break so many things. So I have to do everything very carefully and you cooperate with me, please.

Shri Krishna has said: “Yada yada hi dharmasya, glanirbhavati bharata.” Whenever there is a fall in the human consciousness “Paritranaya sadhunang vinashay cha dushkritam, sambhabami yuge yuge” means “To destroy the ill doers, evil people, and to save the sadhus, the ones who are seekers and who have sought, I take incarnation on this earth. [In Gita verse 7-8 chapter 4]
Now, the present problem that I face is this: that the sadhus have been attacked in a very subtler way by the evil doers, so that there is nobody as pure sadhu or pure evil doer. These evil doers have gone into your brains, they have gone into your being. And the one who tries to warn you or even tell about it may upset, because a little of them is in you. So it is a very delicate operation and is extremely difficult. 

I didn’t expect the sadhus to be in this state. Normally sadhus have an innate, build in system within themselves, that they have logic, they logically and instinctively understand what is the truth. But the evil doers have been so active and so cunning and so camouflaged that they have entered through the back door.  This is between you and me, now, between Me and the deities within you, they are practically exhausted within you and disgusted the way they have been tortured. I’ve seen your Kundalini sometimes, and I’ve seen it’s just putting her head on all both the sides and fourth sides sometimes with helplessness, wounded and terribly tired. So one has to understand that you are all saints, you are people of God, and you have to achieve your Self Realization. 
There are many secrets and mysteries of the Divine which will be revealed to you later on. But first of all, you must have your vibrations, vibratory awareness, a new dimension to ask these absolute questions and to verify whether it is true or not. Now if I tell you that the skin which is one sixteen of an inch, at the most, has got lots of cells in it and is regularized and is very well organised, you are not going to believe it unless and until you have a microscope to see it. 

And the human awareness, at this level if it could see, then it would not have been so much deluded into problems. 
But first of all, I have to make you open your eyes and see trough the microscope. And just before that, if you start denying it, how am I going to push it to it. Now the question – like if somebody says that: “What about tolerance?” Christ, who was the most tolerant divine personality one could think of, has said that: “Those who are not against me, are with me.” So are we going to tolerate Hitler? We had a very good example of this tolerance that we had of mister Hitler; for eleven years he was building up and we were tolerating him and then we had it. 

The destructive forces of this universe are not going to be tolerated by divine Power. All such people will go to Hell, after all, there is hell created for whom? They have no business to deal with anti God activities. He is compassionate, he is kind and he is forgiving. But he is a God of wrath; and beware of that wrath. Who are we the human beings, talking of tolerance, it is he who should decide. What we need is his protection and his guidance and love. So it’s a question of discrimination. 
Say, for example, I would say that: “My Kundalini is all right and I’m all right. I’ve no problems.”  But there are seekers who have problems, their Kundalini is not up, they are in a mess, they are mislead; all right, doesn’t matter, because they are seekers of God. I have to work day in and day out. I have to be the most gentle person with them but not with these evil doers who have tried to kill the children of God! 
In 1970, openly, before about thousand people, I took the name of each and every of these gurus and told that they were all devils, I know them since long. And people were afraid that I’d be killed and this and that. I said: “It was not that Christ crucified himself because others did it”, it is He that had to do it, that’s why he did a drama. And that “He has eleven powers to destroy them, eleven rudras. One of them is sufficient to finish the whole universe.” But that time, He tolerated it , all right, because, that time, nobody was Realized. And none of the saints were troubled. He took up everything upon Himself to prove how stupid we were to crucify Him. So now, first of all, you must get strong with your power, the non violence of the strong has some meaning, what is of a week person tolerating?
But I must say, after Realization, you do get a power to tolerate many more things that normally you cannot tolerate, that you will develop yourself that power within yourself.  

Love teaches you to tolerate because you enjoy the love and not the comfort because love is the most comforting thing. You don’t need any comfort anymore.  But if it comes to the destruction also, this love itself will destroy. And that’s going to happen very soon, before that, better get Realized. Alright, now relax. 
[Laughter]
Alright, so, now we are- 
[To someone] Now please, don’t go in between, it’s a very funny stuff you see, if you are in a- sitting down- and if you going to move out, better move out first. It’s not proper. It’s not proper to behave like this, alright? French are supposed to be very cultured very well behaved people. You shouldn’t disturb others. 

So now, to the questions of the gurus. Logically, as I told you that Self Realization is evolutionary breakthrough.  It’s a living process, has to be spontaneous. You cannot read about it, it’s very vital. Say, our breathing is spontaneous; supposing we have to read about how to breathe, how many of us will exist? We do not do the breathing but the autonomous nervous system is doing it. So it is a spontaneous thing, beyond human control. But if you become super human you will have the control of that. At human level, what you can do is to read a book, think, think, think, that’s all. But you do not know that it cannot be done by thinking. Now you cannot pay for it. You cannot demand it. You cannot, sort of, put an effort for it. So it is absolutely spontaneous. 

Now what do these gurus do? These so called, I call them a-gurus. 
There are, even today in India and all over may be, lots of gurus who are Realized souls. They all know Me and they recognized Me, even I’ve not met them, because their understanding is of a different level. But they are not in the market. 

I called one fellow from- what’s the place of that- Calicut, and I asked him to go to America because I could not go, and he run away the third day from there. He said: “These are mad people I don’t want to deal with them.” There is another guru who is a real one, and I went to see him, he was living on top of a hill, about seven miles we had to walk about. And Sahaja Yogis were surprised they said: “Mother you never go to any guru why should we go there?” So I said: “You feel the vibrations.” And they felt the vibrations very, very strongly and that’s how they knew that he was a Realized soul. 
We went to see him, also the meeting was very dramatic- I’ll tell you later on sometimes- but his legs are broken, his hands are broken. He’s fed up of the people. He said: “These are mad people I have nothing to do with them.” Though he himself has a tiger on which he moves! But he said: “t is easier to manage a tiger than to manage these mad human beings.” He has told Me: “After twelve years, Mother, I’ll come down.” But he send some poets and told them to make poems about Me. The Aarti you sing if from one of the poets. There are so many stories I can tell you about these real gurus. They have really become intolerant of human beings now, because they think human beings are just like scorpions, and they can never be-put right. If you try to do good to them, they will bite you. Now this fellow himself is about more than hundred and five years and this is his opinion about human beings so far. And he said: “They are donkeys; give them the job of the donkeys.”

Now whatever it s, we have to see to the other side of it. Thousands of years back, it was predicted that this time was to come. In Nalazamaity Purana [unsure, it was described that this time is going to come in Kali Yuga, that is modern time, when the seekers are seeking, and they will get Realization. They will come as ordinary people, simple people, householders, and they will get their “atma sakchat kar” means, Self Realization. As I told you Blake, who was there hundred of yeas back, has predicted about these times, to such an extend that [he said] where I will live first and then where I will go next, then  where will be our ashram, to the point of  its place, exact place. 
The predictions have been quite a lot but not so clear cut as Blake has done. 

The predictions have been quite a lot but not so clear cut as Blake has done. There is another very, very good prediction done about two, three thousands years back, may be more, because Grugu was a great muni [sage], was a great seer, about this happening that a unique method would be developed by which the Kundalini would be awakened and that people will become yogis.  And the description is so beautifully done, that one can see through these things. But I don’t need any certificates. Actually, people were a little hesitant, also because of security measures, they didn’t say so many things clearly. Because after Realization, you’ll recognize Me. 
So about these [false] gurus you should not ask Me. Minimum of minimum, any guru can give you his- at least, he should look after your health.  If the guru cannot even give you good health, why are you retaining him? Now they talk of so many things to avoid the issue. They say: ‘These are your karmas you must suffer.” Very good excuse, you see?  But, if this is because of our karmas, why is he taking money from us? That must be also our karmas that we are giving money t this fellow. 

So I will tell you about the karma also in this lecture. Now, about other Yoga systems, the Hatha Yoga is Patanjali Yoga Shastra. Now there are in Patanjali Yoga Shastra, there are “Ashtamgas”, eight things. Out of them, one is for “Yaman Yama” and out of that, one third is the physical exercises,  Ya-Yama. That too, first and foremost thing in Patanjali Yoga Shastra is “Ishwara Pranidhana”, meaning that your God must be established first in your heart, means when the Kundalini moves, then only you will know what chakras are catching.  

For example, when we were coming from our house, we met the jam on the way. Sitting at home, without starting the car, how can we know about the jams? Before starting the car what’s the use of moving the wheels and the steering wheel? It is very simple that it has to be an awaken state in which you can correct your charkas. Now the “asanas” are also not to be taken whole, like the whole medicine bottle. We also use asanas according to the need of the charkas, according to the personality. For a person, say, who is a left sided, he should not do any asana, whatsoever where he has to bent forward. And the one who is right sided should not do any exercise which is backwards. No one knows about it. Will you take medicines without consulting the doctor? The only trouble is that for yoga there are no doctors who can be produced out of college. You have to have a divine authority. And unless and until you have the divine authority, you cannot say that this is this or that, this is that. 

Now the questions were, somehow I’ve told of Patanjali or Raja Yoga is a thing that happens within yourself and the Kundalini rises. It is not that you can do it from outside. Again the same thing like, not without starting the car, you move it. Same style is Kriya Yoga. The “Kriya” means the action takes place within because when the Kundalini rises, there must be happening something, to keep it sustained there, to make it expand, to go up, there must be something happening inside.
