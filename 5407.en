When the Kuṇḍalinī rises it makes sounds. And the sounds that are heard in the different chakras can be pronounced in the following way – these pronunciations are being used in the phonetic language of Devanāgarī, which means ‘the language spoken by the Devās’.

At the Moolādhāra (Mūlādhāra 4 petals- last semivowel + 3 sibilants), where there are four petals, the sounds are: in Devanāgarī: [व-va, श-śa,  ष-ṣa, स-sa] (In Sanskṛit it will be: वं-vam, शं-śam,  षं-ṣam, सं-sam base bīja mantra is लं-Lam-Lambodara-diety Shrī  Gaṇeśha) Out of which the last, ष-ṣa, स-sa sounds are very close, but the difference is – when the snake hisses it makes this ष-ṣa – the third sound. So, [व-va, श-śa,  ष-ṣa, स-sa].

At the Swādhiṣhṭhāna - (6 petals- last 3 labials + 3 semivowels), where there are six petals, it makes sounds, six sounds: in Devanāgarī: ब-ba, भ-bha, म-ma, य-ya, र-ra, ल-la [in Sanskṛit: बं -bam, भं -bham, मं -mam, यं-yam, रं ram, लं-lam base bīja mantra is वं-Vam- deity Shrī Saraswatī].

Maṇipūra (Nābhī 10 petals- last 3 cerebrals + 5 dentals + first 2 labials) it has ten petals. It makes the sounds: ड-da (ḍa), ढ-dha, ण ṇ, त-ta, थ-tha, द-da, ध-dha, न-n, प-pa, फ-pha [in Sanskṛit:   डं-dam(ḍam), ढं-dham, णं-ṇam, तं-tam, थं-tham, दं-dam, धं-dham, नं-nam, पं-pam, फं-pham base bīja mantra is रं-Ram-Shrī-Rāma-deity Lakshmi-Viṣhṇu]

At Anāhata (heart) there are twelve petals. (12 petals- 5 guttural and 5 palatal consonants + first two cerebral)  Note: Cerebrals (letters with dots under) are said with the tongue curled back, touching the palate.

It makes the sounds: in Devanāgarī: क-ka, ख-kha, ग-ga, घ-gha, ङ-nga(ṅa), च-cha, छ-chha, ज-ja, झ-jha, ञ-gnya(ña), ट-ṭa, ठ-ṭha.  (In Sanskṛit कं-kam, खं-kham, गं-gam, घं-gham, ङं-ngam(ṅa), चं-cham, छं-chham, जं-jam, झं-jham, ञं-gnyam(ña), टं-ṭam, ठं-ṭham. and base bīja mantra is यं-yam deity-Yama].

At the Viśhuddhi, where there are sixteen petals, it makes the sounds of all the vowels: in Devanāgarī: अ-a, आ-ā, इ-i, ई-ī, उ-u, ऊ-ū, ऋ-ṛ, ॠ-ṝ, ऌ-ḷ, ॡ-ḹ, ए-ē, ऐ-ai, ओ-ō, औ-au, अ -aṃ, अः-aḥ. [in Sanskṛit: अं-am, आं-ām, इं-im, ईं-īm, उं-um, ऊं-ūm, ऋं-ṛm, ॠं-ṝm, ऌं-ḷm, ॡं-ḹm, एं-ēm, ऐं-aim, ओं -ōn, औ-aun, अं-aṃm, अः-aḥ. and base bīja mantra is हं-Ham-Deity:Shrī Hari]

At the Āgñyā chakra (2 petals) it makes in Devanāgarī: ह-ha, क्ष-kṣa.(In Sanskṛit: हं-ham, क्षं-kṣam. and base bīja mantra is ॐ - Om)

At the Sahasrāra, one becomes thoughtless and no sound is made, but the pure Anāhata, meaning the throbbing in the purest form as in the heart is all: lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub.

When all these sounds are sounded together and pass through the spiral of the body, if the body is like a conch, the sound that comes out of the synthesis is Aum. Like the seven colours of the sun ultimately become white rays, or you can say the golden coloured rays.

There are three Granthis, means the knots: the Brahma-granthi, the Vishnu-granthi and the Rudra-granthi.

With Agni, means fire, when the Brahma-granthi meets between the Kundalini, Moolādhāra chakra and the Swādhiṣhṭhāna – means Moolādhāra chakra, Moolādhāra and Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra – then Agni Brahma-granthi is established. Vishnu-granthi when mixes up with the Surya, that is between the Nābhī and the Hṛidaya chakra (heart chakra), Surya Vishnu-granthi is established. When Viśhuddhi and Āgñyā auras meet, then Chandra Rudra-granthi is established.

Altogether there are fourteen Nāḍis. The names are: Alambusi, Kuhu, Vishwodhāri, Varunā, Hastajihvā, Yaśhaswati, Aśhavini, Gandhāri, Pushā, śhankhini, Saraswatī, Iḍā, Piñgalā, Suṣhumna.

Apart from two chakras, which are Surya and Chandra, there are nine other chakras: Iḍā, Piñgalā, Suṣhumna, Maṇipūra chakra, Anāhata chakra, Viśhuddhi chakra. Lambika chakra – this is also called as Hamsa chakra, Āgñyā chakra. Between Āgñyā and Sahasrāra there are two other sub-chakras, known as Nāda, Bindu. So, we have: Moolādhāra, Swādhiṣhṭhāna, Manipur, Anāhat, Viśhuddhi, Lambikā, called as Soham called as Hamsa, Āgñyā, Nāda, Bindu, Sahasrāra.
