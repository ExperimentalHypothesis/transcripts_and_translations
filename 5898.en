b'Guru Puja, "The Declaration of Shri Mataji". Dollis Hill ashram, London, England. 2 December 1979.\n\nA month back, I told Rustom, that you must have, a Puja arranged, this Sunday. It\xe2\x80\x99s a full moon day, and he asked Me what should you call is it a Guru Puja, or is it a Puja for Mahalaxmi, or Ganesha\xe2\x80\x99s Puja. So I told him call it a Guru Puja. And he asked Me later on, much later \xe2\x80\x93 when I was going to India \xe2\x80\x93 that why not also have the Christmas Puja over here?\nToday is a very, important day. Because, long time back, when Christ was just a child, He read from the Scriptures, and declared to the multitudes, that He was the Advent \xe2\x80\x93 the incarnation, who is the Savior. They believed that a Savior is going to come. Today, long time back, on a Sunday, He said, He declared that He was the Savior. That\xe2\x80\x99s why today is the Advent Sunday. He had to live for a very very short time. So at a very young age He had to declare that He was the Advent. Now it is remarkable to see, that before this, no incarnation said publicly, that, they were incarnations. Rama of course, had forgotten that He was an incarnation. In a way, He made Himself to forget, played His maya upon Himself to become a complete human being \xe2\x80\x93 Maryada Purushottama and Shri Krishna also only told, one person Arjuna, just before he was to start the war. Abraham never said that He was the incarnation, though He was the incarnation of Primordial Master. Dattatreya Himself never said that He was the incarnation of the Primordial Master. With all these three forces, acting through innocence, came on this earth to guide, Moses never said that\xe2\x80\xa6 though they knew He was great, He had overpowered Nature, but He never said that He was the incarnation.\nAt the time of Christ, one felt it was necessary to say otherwise people won\xe2\x80\x99t understand. If at that time they had recognized Christ, there would have been no problem. But still, human beings had to evolve, further. Somebody had to cross the Agnya Chakra in the Virata, to go through that door. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Christ came on this Earth. It is most surprising, that in this tree of Life, when the roots give out the shoot, and the shoot gives out the branches, and the branches give out the leaves, and the flowers also blossom out of the same tree, those who know the roots do not want to know the shoot, those who know the shoot do not want to recognize the flowers. This is typical human nature.\nI never said about Myself. Because, it was felt, that human beings have now achieved another dimension of ego. Even worse, than at the time of Christ. May you blame anything, you can call it Industrial Revolution because you were away from nature, or whatever you may call it. But human beings had lost all contact, with reality. They were identified with artificiality, and to accept such a great reality is going to be impossible for them, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I never said a word about Myself -,till of course some of the saints, told about Me, some of the possessed people also told about Me; and also people started wondering, that how the most difficult thing of Kundalini awakening takes place, with that speed in the presence of \xe2\x80\x9cMataji\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThere was a temple in India and nobody knew about it, but they found that the ships which went near a particular spot, were drawn towards the shore. And it was difficult to ply them back and they had to put double force to take out of that attraction, and they did not know that there was some thing that was acting. They thought there was something wrong, with the depth of the sea. But, invariably it happened to many ships. Then they wanted to find out, after all what is happening to those ships, why all the ships suddenly start getting attracted towards the shore So they tried to find out, and when they went into the jungles they found a big temple, and on top of the temple was kept a huge mass of magnet.\n\nSo through rational understanding, people reach the point, that Mataji has to be something exceptional, because, nowhere in the scriptures written down anywhere, that such an incarnation came on this Earth \xe2\x80\x93 whose mere glance, even thought, can raise the Kundalini. Many saints, who are away from the madding crowd, sitting in the jungles, on the Himalayas, all know about it. Because their awareness is at a point, where they understand. They understand much more than you do, because you are still children, newly born. They are grown up.\n\nBut today is the day, I declare that I am the One who has to save the humanity. I declare I am the One who is Adishakti, who is the Mother of all the Mothers, who is the Primordial Mother, the Shakti, the Desire of God, who has incarnated on this Earth to give its meaning to itself, to this creation, to human beings, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure through My love and patience and My powers, I am going to achieve it.\nI was the One who was born again and again, but now in My complete form and complete powers, I have come on this Earth, not only for salvation of human beings, not only for their emancipation, but for granting them the Kingdom of Heaven, the Joy, the Bliss, that your Father wants to bestow upon you.\n\nThese words are to be kept within the bounds of Sahaja Yogis only, for the time being. And today is the day of Guru Puja, not My Puja, but your Puja as Gurus. I anoint all of you as Gurus, and today I will tell you what I have bestowed upon you and what great powers you already have within you.\nAmong you, there are people who are still not been able to recognize. My announcement will work it out within them \xe2\x80\x93 the recognition. Without recognition you cannot see the play, without play, you cannot have confidence within yourself, without confidence you cannot become Guru, without becoming Guru you cannot help others, and without helping others you are not going to be in any way happy. So, to break the chain, is very easy, but to build the chain one after another is what you have to do. This is what you were all wanting to be. So, be confident, and be joyous, and be happy that all My powers will protect you, My Love \xe2\x80\x93 will nourish you, and My nature will fill you with peace and joy.\nMay God Bless You!\n\n[the following was transcribed from an Mp3 recording of a tape in India]\nNow I would like to give the books first of all. And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\xa6 about what you have got already within you. All weeping and crying should be over now. You have to wipe out the tears of others. Get out of your small shells and little problems, here and there.\nFirst book, Kuli, can you give Me.\n[inaudible words]\nWhere is the pen?\nYogi: \xe2\x80\xa6want a pen Mother?\nShri Mataji: I would like to write in Devalipi, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a mantra, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? It has to be written in Devalipi your names, would be better than in English, though utility-wise English would be better, but from, from Sahaj Yoga point of view, I think, if I write in Devalipi it would be better and you will know it is your name.\nSo the first book. \xe2\x80\x9cAdvent!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 by which we declare, the advent of your Mother, your own, very own Mother. Today, I would like to give to Gregoire, who has really worked very hard to write this book, and, I have tortured his life\xe2\x80\xa6 and also Gavin, Jane, who have helped him such a lot, and Maureen who has helped him to type and read My funny handwriting which had mutilated all previous writings of Gregoire [Mother chuckles]. We have had a very nice time together, and now the book is ready. We should also be very thankful to Indian Sahaja Yogis, for giving all their assistance, to Gregoire, for the publication of this book. They have given the money and all the assistance. There are so many people who are to be thanked, but actually this is your own book. And the most important person whom you should thank is [unclear: WULEE?], or, Tony as you call him, because, he has taken the photograph, which turned out to be the best among all. He\xe2\x80\x99s not a photographer, by chance he had taken a photograph, it\xe2\x80\x99s such a sahaja photograph. And everybody said that this photograph should be\xe2\x80\xa6 there. And everybody, not feeling jealous of anyone, have very sensibly behaved that the book should come out; and the involvement that everyone had; and they all helped\xe2\x80\xa6\nEven the coming of book was so sahaja, that, first it would not come. It has come at a time when we needed it the most: it should not have come earlier, because we wanted advent date for this book. And, the coming of it was that, the ship people told Me that the books have arrived\xe2\x80\xa6 and you have to collect the books, and we have to take all\xe2\x80\xa6 customs clearance and all that. But then they told Me that surprisingly, the customs people did not ask anything; they did not even open the boxes; they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to know anything what was inside. They were all quite surprised. Normally, even if you say books they open it and see for themselves whether there are books or not, maybe something else coming in. And there was a niece of mine, who was there, who telephoned to us \xe2\x80\x93 that also spontaneously \xe2\x80\x93 and I told her such books are lying with such people, and just they arrived \xe2\x80\x93 it was that simple. And they t\xe2\x80\xa6\n[Mp3 no.1 sound cuts off]\n[Mp3 no.2:]\nShould I write it here, or here Gregoire?. Here would\xe2\x80\xa6\nThis is the cover, I would like \xe2\x80\x93 just show them \xe2\x80\x93 to give to Gregoire, just show round, with the peacocks. Peacock is the\xe2\x80\xa6 is the vahana of Saraswati.\nActually it is kept the other way round, you see?\nSahaja Yogi[softly]: I think\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: Beg pardon, what is it?\nSahaja Yogi: [CHRIS?] was trying to explain what Shri Kartikeya was like.\nOther Sahaja Yogi: He was just like Gregoire. [laughter].\nShri Mataji: Actually books are always done this way, you know? You can do it on the ground would be better. This way, and then is covered like that, you see? It\xe2\x80\x99s always books are done.\nSahaja Yogi: Mother this way?\nShri Mataji: It\xe2\x80\x99s on this way it comes up. See? So, they are kept. Hm, I think then they go round. Ya and, this is brought in\xe2\x80\xa6 that side.. this way, and the pin must be put here or some sort of a thing. Actually they have a ribbon with it, attached, when they tie it up the book like that. This is called as grantha, you see, the one which is tied, grantha.\nAll these books must be kept, tied in a proper cloth, in this way. And before opening the book you must wash your hands \xe2\x80\x93 properly. It should not be kept in every place you feel like: must be kept in proper places. And the due protocol of the book must be kept. It is very important.\nWhich are the names? Which are the people?\nRustom: Gavin, your copy.\nShri Mataji: What is it?\nSahaja Yogi: We had to copy the [...indistinct]\nShri Mataji: Alright. So to Jane, to\xe2\x80\xa6 second to Rustom\xe2\x80\xa6\nRustom [interupting]: \xe2\x80\xa6Walter\nShri Mataji: Ah? [pause] This is the Guru Puja, I\xe2\x80\x99m doing. [pause] Jane? There you go. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m doing your one.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll use it.\nAll of you must have your individual copies. That is very important. And as everybody has different vibrations, it must be treated with the same understanding that, you all should have your individual thing with you.\n[Mother writes the names of all the Yogis in Devnagari in their copies of the books]\nLet Me just finish the work, alright?\nSo now\xe2\x80\xa6 Tony? What should I write? Tony or Kuli?\nTony: Tony\nShri Mataji: What\xe2\x80\x99s your real name?\nTony: Antonacis\nShri Mataji: Anthony. Anthony.

Now (has he come back, Peter? Not yet. [Hindi question to Rustom][noise on mike]\xe2\x80\xa6talk about it? Should I tell you? Now, Alright?\nSahaja Yogi: [unclear] [THE BEST KIND OF TECHNOLOGY?]\nShri Mataji: You can tape this. Sit-down sit-down sit-down sit-down sit-down. Ha. Mm.\nThe other day I told you about shambhavopaya and nishaktopaya. These are two methods of\xe2\x80\xa6 [cleansing people?]. One is by which you cleanse people -,very few of them \xe2\x80\x93 you take a handful of them and go on cleansing them, so their chitta is completely cleansed, all their five elements are cleansed and\xe2\x80\xa6 then the Kundalini is raised and people get realization. That\xe2\x80\x99s called as Shambhavopaya, in which \xe2\x80\xa6your personality is cleansed out completely. Another is Shaktopaya, I said where there is Shakti, which, makes your Kundalini rise, whatever may be the situation, and then looks after the cleansing. So, in our Sahaja Yoga, we have used the second part because there is no time left for Shambhavopaya. There it would be impossible to do it.\n\nSo in Shaktopaya, normally people\xe2\x80\xa6 what we do is Shaktipath, is to make their power, that is Shakti, to fall upon another one, like the reflection. Or, as we say, \xe2\x80\x98the light is falling on us.\xe2\x80\x99 So, they let their power, or their Kundalini\xe2\x80\x99s power, fall on to the power of other\xe2\x80\x99s Kundalini and then gradually raise it. But for that, human beings as they are, they have their very laborious methods, for that also. Is that theyfirst, they will choose your, what is the problem of Kundalini. So, they\xe2\x80\x99ll go through all your history, find out what sort of parents you have had and this and that, what kinds of dreams you have; they analyze you completely. And then also they find out what kind of diseases you could have had. For example, anybody who has got, say, eye\xe2\x80\x99s trouble, or trouble with the nose, or trouble with the throat, or with the stomach and all kinds of things, are avoided. So you can imagine how many of us would fit into that category. And\xe2\x80\xa6 then they would, also find out what sort of life they have led and what sort of parents they have got. Mostly, it was done also to people who, actually at a very young age, went to the Gurus and asked for this Shaakta thing \xe2\x80\x93 Nishaktipath.\n\nNow, because of Me, it has become very simple, as you know is the Shaktipath, that what you have to do now is Shaktipath, means, to throw your light onto others. \xe2\x80\x98Shakti\xe2\x80\x99 is power and \xe2\x80\x98path\xe2\x80\x99 means to make it fall. So, your Shakti can now fall onto anybody\xe2\x80\x99s Kundalini and it can rise. Now, it was a very, very difficult thing. They said only person who is a \xe2\x80\x98Veetaraga\xe2\x80\x99, the one who has conquered all his \xe2\x80\x98raaga\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98raaga\xe2\x80\x99 means any attachment \xe2\x80\x93 all the attachments \xe2\x80\x93 the one who has conquered. He\xe2\x80\x99s without any attachment, he\xe2\x80\x99s completely detached in life, can only do the Kundalini rising. So first of all, \xe2\x80\x98Deeksha\xe2\x80\x99 has to be given, is initiation. That you have already got. The day you came to Me you got the Deeksha. You do not realize, that\xe2\x80\xa6 how it happens. Such a lot of things have happened to you, telescopically, that you do not realize how many things have happened to you. So, only for Deeksha, you see, a person is taxed quite a lot. I mean, you have to look after your Guru quite a lot, and you have to take some fruits and things like that. Money also some of these nonsensical people take, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, but even there is, some \xe2\x80\x98Dakshina\xe2\x80\x99 has to be given, because, see, Guru has to be looked after by the \xe2\x80\x98Chelas\xe2\x80\x99.\nThe Guru is after all, is not at all attached to your wealth or to anything that you give. But it is the duty of the Shishyas [disciples] to look after the Guru, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why a little money is also\xe2\x80\xa6 was to be given, to a Guru. I mean, of course they are now misusing the whole stuff, because the Guru has to live somewhere; he has to have a house and, all these things. So a little money was also given, called as Dakshina. The whole thing is now so misinterpreted and has been taken to such a nonsensical limit, that people are just making it an enterprise. But the Guru had to be something, of that level, who would raise the Kundalini. And that Guru was \xe2\x80\x98Veetaraga\xe2\x80\x99, means the one who is, lost all attachment of the world \xe2\x80\x93 absolutely unattached. Who\xe2\x80\x99s chitta has been cleared so much, that there is no greed left in him, there is no temptation left in him. There is only forgiveness in the person. Such a person was regarded as a \xe2\x80\x98Veetaraga\xe2\x80\x99, and when such a person, raised the Kundalini he could. Only Kundalini could be commanded by only such rare people.\n\nSo, first of all, you have got the diksha [initiation] of a Guru without any introduction. So, the diksha you have got. You have got the maha diksha also. First is the diksha. Then, what is the maha diksha? The second maha diksha is that you are given a mantra, only one name is given, otherwise, normally. But this mantra is also to be taken out, because, the Guru, if he knows- I mean, these Gurus did not even know what chakras you are catching, just imagine! So, they used to consult your horoscope. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have come at such and such time to me,\xe2\x80\x9d say, \xe2\x80\x9ctoday you have come to see me. Now what is your horoscope? So, what must be your trouble? Under what nakshatra \xe2\x80\x93 constellation - you were born? What was the name of your parents? Then, there\xe2\x80\x99s a big science about it: they used to count from A-B-C-D like that, and reach a point where they would find the words. What is the second word, what is the third word, like that, and then they used to consult, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big shastra [science]. And after consulting that they would find out what is the chakra catching in you. And then they would give you a name, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright, say Rama.\xe2\x80\x9d You go on saying \xe2\x80\x9cRama, Rama\xe2\x80\x9d, till your right heart chakra is cured. This may take two years, three years, maybe two lives, maybe a hundred lives \xe2\x80\x93 you carry on with one mantra \xe2\x80\x9cRama, Rama, Rama\xe2\x80\x9d, always. But this was to be done with all those consultations of your constellation and everything, your family, house, everything, and then to be brought to that point where the chakra is caught up.\nNow, supposing, your four chakras are caught up\xe2\x80\xa6 [Yogini speaks in Marathi &amp; Shri Mataji replies briefly in Marathi.]\n\nBecause, you see, whatever is in the horoscope denotes what is the trouble you are having, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Or what troubles you\xe2\x80\x99ll be having \xe2\x80\x93 physical, only, to begin with. So, they would know through your Kundalee, means your horoscope, what was the trouble you are having. Supposing you are having a trouble in your stomach, so they would go round and round and round and found out one mantra for the stomach. Because, directly they cannot find out.\n\nLike the scientist, you see. Scientist, how they find out things? See, supposing you go to the doctor: he will take out your eyes, wash it nicely, put it back, say \xe2\x80\x9ceyes are alright.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he\xe2\x80\x99ll take out your teeth, make artificial teeth, jam them in saying that your teeth were alright [Shri Mataji laughs]. He\xe2\x80\x99ll take out your ears, fix up something new, artificial, say it\xe2\x80\x99s alright, take out your heart, examine it, put another one there. It\xe2\x80\x99s like this, you see in the same way they used to do it, because, they were groping in the dark. As you people know about chakras, they did not know what are the chakras catching. So, you can imagine, what a maha, maha, maha diksha you have got now.\nFirst is you have got a diksha; the day your Kundalini rises is the diksha. Then you get your Realization. This is out of question, they can never talk in one breath. You are kept hanging in the air, you see, all the time, upside down \xe2\x80\x93 just like bats in the night, you see? Then they would consult other things like, they would see what kinds of friends you keep, to what people you are attracted, so the temperaments they will see. From that also they will judge. May give you another mantra.\nSo, these mantras you go on sitting and [for] hours together with them, all the time, reciting these mantras without paying attention to your other needs. And this was, when the mantra was achieved, they used to call it \xe2\x80\x9cAll right. The mantra is \xe2\x80\x98siddha\xe2\x80\x99 [established] now for you.\xe2\x80\x9d Means now this mantra you can use for somebody else, means only Rama\xe2\x80\x99s mantra you could use, just imagine!\n\nNow, what have you got it? You have got your Realization \xe2\x80\x93 alright. But Realization means you have got the complete knowledge as to what mantra is to be made for, any chakra whatsoever. You can coin your own mantras.\nThen you also have got the power to know all the chakras which are needing the help. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got power to raise the Kundalini of other people. You have got power to fix the Kundalini onto Sahastrara if it is falling down. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got power to cleanse the chakras of the other people and your own. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got power to fix the chakras also by giving it a bandhan. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got power to protect yourself from all negativity through your bandhan. You have got power, to direct your attention to any place by which you can know about anyone who needs your help.\nYou have got power to feel the problem in the collective, also. Like, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with London? Put your hands. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with London? Like this, like this, Frank, never towards Me, dangerous.\nRustom: Left Heart very strong.\nShri Mataji: Left heart.\nSahaja Yogini: Right Heart.\nRustom: And Right Heart.\nShri Mataji: And Right Heart, that way, everything, but minimum left heart.\nSahaja Yogi: And Right Swadisthan.\nShri Mataji: Right Swadisthan.\nNow, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a language which describes something. See, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the language to these seven, you said \xe2\x80\x9cleft heart.\xe2\x80\x9d You have not hurt anyone by saying that. You Londoners are catching on left heart, means what? That means you are going against God. You are not interested in the Spirit, you are materialists. You are egoistical. You do not care for your Spirit. You are trying to harm your Spirit, you are drunkards. You are going to ruin yourself in drinking. But all this you don\xe2\x80\x99t say. You just say: \xe2\x80\x9cYour left heart is catching\xe2\x80\x9d finished.\n[Laughter]\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t even say that you should do any forgiveness and all that. You only just put your hand like this, and ask for the forgiveness of all the Londoners on the left heart. And they are forgiven and then they drink more and drink more and have a worse heart.\n[Laughter]\n\nSo, all these powers you have got now is to raise the Kundalini and to remove the obstructions in the Kundalini. If there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody\xe2\x80\x99s Agnya Chakra would be caught up, the Guru would not remove his Agnya Chakra, fearing that his own Agnya Chakra would be caught up.\n\nSo, they had to first do the mantras to be "siddha". "Siddha" means, the one which is proved now - effective. Your every mantra is effective. You take the name of the deity and your mantra is effective, it\xe2\x80\x99s already Siddha. Like a bundle it has got everything into it, you open it and you get it.\nIf somebody\xe2\x80\x99s any chakra is catching and you just say the mantra and finished. And you have knowledge of all the mantras and you know what it is. And you have all the knowledge and it is so secret that others do not know. Even if you do not take the names, you just point at, everybody knows what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, where to go, what to say. So, though it is so much secret, it is so much understood between you. See the homogenous understanding between us is we know what is what. And then we do not feel bad about ourselves and about others. Though I say that your Mr. E-G-O is big, nobody hits Me back. At the time of Christ, it was impossible to take the name of E-G-O. Now you can say, and you can see also clearly your ego, your super-ego, your nonsense, this, that, everything you can see.\n\nEven if somebody, has the power, say is a born-realized person, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know a word about how to raise the Kundalini. He cannot raise the Kundalini unless and until he has become a Sahaja Yogi! So those born-realized who think no end of themselves should know that they have to become Sahaja Yogis, otherwise they are not effective; they cannot be Kriyavati \xe2\x80\x93 they cannot go into action.\nSo, all these things you have got within yourself, that you have the full knowledge. about the deities. You know why they get angry; what is the problem; by what sin they get angry. Only if I say, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Commit Sin\xe2\x80\x9d, finished. you\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a sin?\xe2\x80\x9d Then if you say that \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t commit this,\xe2\x80\x9d but now it is not only that, but you try some tricks, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have it. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\xa6 compulsory bandhan on you, of your Mother. If you try to drink, you\xe2\x80\x99ll vomit. If you do anything wrong, your stomach will go out. If you try to avoid Sahaja Yoga, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be there. Because, though you are not feeling it, you have felt, inside yourself, the charm of Sahaja Yoga.\nBut, there is a group of people, still, who have been realized and who are not, yet there. Now what is the difference between the two is? Very simple \xe2\x80\x93 is the recognition. Those who have not recognized Me, will not be blessed. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be going round and round and round. So it is necessary to recognize. Now there are some people, like\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, very good example is, Shirdi Sainath\xe2\x80\x99s disciples are there. Now, he is no more. So they believe in him. Now where is he? They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to believe in the present incarnation, they want to believe in something that is dead, they believe in Rama, they\xe2\x80\x99ll believe in Christ. Most of the Christians have this problem. Even they will relate Me only to Christ. If I cannot relate Myself to Christ they cannot be in Sahaja Yoga. Or they\xe2\x80\x99ll relate Me, only to Moses, or to someone like that. You have to live in the present, and you cannot conceptualize Me Your concepts are limited supposing you were born here. You would be Christian. But if you are born in India you would be a Hindu. If you are born in China, you would be Chinese, with your eyes like that. You could have been anything, so, when your misidentification starts working, immediately you know!\xe2\x80\xa6that you are misidentified, because vibrations will stop. So the group of people which are in between \xe2\x80\x93 the people, who are not yet settled down fully into Sahaja Yoga, who are not fully empowered, are the people who cannot recognize. And they feel very proud about it sometimes that \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot recognize.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s foolishness.\nImmediately your vibrations will start flowing as soon as you recognize. And the \xe2\x80\x93 such group of people, are the people who are coming from various sources of\xe2\x80\xa6 we can say various sources of other Gurus and things like that.,Then there is a problem about them. And such people, when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they get their realization.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m generosity I should say. They all get their realization whatever may be the case. Even the other day we had a prostitute there, she also got the realization. And Sahaja Yoga also gives a very long rope. You do not lose your vibrations easily, if you get them properly. But what happens just after Sahaja Yoga: being the light, you start seeing all your defects within yourself. Then you want to deny Sahaja Yoga. Some people start getting tingling. Some people normally feel alright but in My presence they start shaking, or going into contortions. As soon as some people see Me, you have seen, that they become heated up; they get pain in the stomach \xe2\x80\x93 because, when you face the light you start facing yourself. And you do not want to face yourself. The main thing is those who are not yet steady in Sahaja Yoga, are not willing to face themselves. If they would face themselves they would correct themselves so fast, because there is light, you do not identify yourself with your defects. You are the doctor, you have the light and you operate. Also you know how to operate. If you just decide on this point that \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to face myself, let me see who I am,\xe2\x80\x9d all these defects will run away.- but you do not want to face it. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why those who get realization also don\xe2\x80\x99t want to come to it. Those who also get cool breeze, they don\xe2\x80\x99t think much of it. Because if they think much of it they have to give up their ego, with which they are identified all these years. Moreover they will have to see themselves. So, they say \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not better, I am tingling and this is happening, there are needle and pins in My body, and that is\xe2\x80\xa6, how can I be? It is not helping me. Sahaja Yoga is taking me backwards.\xe2\x80\x9d They\xe2\x80\x99ll start blaming the Sahaja Yoga for it, instead of seeing to people who have improved.\nBut whom are you blaming? You are blaming something that is going to save you. You are blaming your Savior. Is better to see your own problems, your own defects and come up. To be very kind to yourself is this: that\xe2\x80\xa6you get rid of all these serpents and scorpions and all those, other things that are hanging around and just become pure. And the light has come. In this light you should start seeing what is the truth. Then your misidentifications will drop out and your real identification will be established. Otherwise it cannot be done. You must learn to face yourself, never justify. Now some people have a habit of justifying even their son, or their brother, or wife or husband. You are not helping them by that. Then these negative people have a thing to go together. Always two negative will join together, to put up a show. I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised we don\xe2\x80\x99t even have any union here. See otherwise we can have \xe2\x80\x9cnegative people\xe2\x80\x99s union, against Mataji.\xe2\x80\x9d I mean you could be, facing like that. Because [YOU or THEY, not clear] always combine and, there is a big fraternity among negative people, big fraternity! Because, you have seen, that, those who are robbers, they always combine together. They are very friendly. They keep all the secrets. But two good people, if they combine, the whole world can be changed. So, you must understand that try to go to a person who is positive. Otherwise you cannot develop your Sahaja Yoga. Who talks negatively: you do not go near them.\nNow, in this country, there\xe2\x80\x99s another group of people. Because you are going to be Guru tomorrow, I am telling you all types. They do not want to face themselves, but there are many ways by which they avoid it. One of them is: as soon as they get realization, they start analyzing it. You give them anything, they\xe2\x80\x99ll analyze. I mean in this country, they think they can analyze everything! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know from where did they get this idea. Maybe this\xe2\x80\xa6 scientist or maybe these psychologist, must have \xe2\x80\x93 other intellectuals, so-called \xe2\x80\x93 they might have given this idea.: that you take everything, this-is-this-because-of-this. I mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have your eyes opened. You are such little babies still. How can you analyze all these things? So you start analyzing everything. Why this has happened, why that has happened! Once you start analyzing, you lose everything\xe2\x80\xa6 Start talking about it, analyzing about it. What you have to do is to receive it, assimilate it, take it more and more. Expose yourself. Do not find faults, with Sahaja Yoga, but know that there are faults with you which can only be corrected through Sahaja love. There are people who even come on Me. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you do like this, Mother? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you do like that?\xe2\x80\x9d I think I know My job very well. They try to teach Me also. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should have done like this, you should have done like that.\xe2\x80\x9d Whichever way you do, if somebody is jack-in-the-box, he\xe2\x80\x99ll always come up, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of the person. So you change that nature, \xe2\x80\x9cRemove your springs a little bit. Settle down.\xe2\x80\x9d And these spring are nothing but this analytical business. Such people you will meet many.\nSo how to approach these people? What I have done about these analytical people, that is what you have to do with them. Now, listen very carefully. You give realization to somebody. Alright? And the person feels the cool breeze in the hand. Now he starts saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, so what! I feel, so what?\xe2\x80\x9d Now you tell him, that \xe2\x80\x9cyou did not get them by thinking, did you? Or through analysis?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou never had them before?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it now\xe2\x80\xa6 Now what are these? You explain.\xe2\x80\x9d You cannot explain, so it is, something that has happened to you beyond your thinking power\xe2\x80\xa6 Is a higher power than your thinking. You see, they\xe2\x80\xa6 Thoughtless means they think he\xe2\x80\x99s a mad cap. You see? If you talk thoughtless awareness, they think,\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that means you don\xe2\x80\x99t think, means you are easily\xe2\x80\xa6 primitive.\xe2\x80\x9d They think you are primitive if you do not think. It has happened through a power, which is much higher than you! By thinking what have you done? By thinking: you have cut your noses, cut your eyes, cut your hands, everything you have cut. And now you are going to have a big war. Wonderful thinking. So you tell them, \xe2\x80\x9cby thinking you never got it and this is some higher power.\xe2\x80\x9d Talk of higher things \xe2\x80\x93 that has given you this. So if you have to be in that higher power, this lower power of your thinking you put it down a little. That\xe2\x80\x99s how they\xe2\x80\x99ll come round. If you try to say, \xe2\x80\x9coh don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d they will say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Don\xe2\x80\x99t think means it is not even thinkable. I mean it is that useless!\xe2\x80\x9d And this is to tackle these people who are egoistical, and who think, and who would not even accept even if they get cool breeze. So gradually, you help them.\n\nThen for a guru, as you are now, you have all the knowledge, all the power and everything. But what we lack, is confidence\xe2\x80\xa6 and we have inertia within us. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, how this inertia is going to get out. You know sometimes, people who are that inert, they also have a use, and they are put in the canons, you see, and blasted in a circus, so they can show their feats. They are so inert that nothing can disturb them. But, you are My children. I have made you after the image of Jesus Christ, of Shri Ganesh. All their powers are available to you. And this is one point I fail sometimes I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, how to remove your inertia. Because, you have not practiced Sahaj Yoga. You have not gone into any practice. You got it very easily cheaply. You do not understand its value. So you just want to have as a side track, you know? You have to discipline yourself, unless and until you discipline yourself, I leave it to your freedom, because I have always believed in the freedom of My children, because I think they are not that low type, that I should put freedom on them as a, sort-of-a bar, that they should not use their freedom. You\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely free. If you want to go to hell, I will give you a chariot, to go direct. But if you want to go to heaven, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a vimana \xe2\x80\x93 an aeroplane, to go there. So it is for you people, to become dynamic, and to have confidence within you. You know every Chakras; you know every rising of the Kundalini you know everything. Take it upon yourself! Then a person who takes it upon himself, you see I\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 I can be very angry with all of you. Very simple. But no I have to get the job done. I have to talk to you nicely I have to sometimes scold you, I have to ask you this way, that way, you know? Marinate you, sometimes, sometimes put little grease, sometimes do this do that, sometimes give some heat, sometimes cold. Manage them, somehow, bring them round, and treat them in such a way that they are there. In the same way you have to treat those people. Not to get angry with them \xe2\x80\x93 to get angry is the easiest way, you see. Then have no problems. Once I get angry with you all, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have My own peace. No problem. But you have to be really very-very, patient with all of them. Extremely patient: your language\xe2\x80\xa6 [virtually inaudible][long pause] \xe2\x80\x9cPlease\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry \xe2\x80\x9c. You have lots of words here, but I think they have lost their value. So we come to one point we must [PLEAD?] from our heart, We must feel from our hear that \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to save this man. We have to help him.\xe2\x80\x9d Then sometimes you have to scold also, because you\xe2\x80\x99ll find most of the negative people, will be the greatest, fussiest ever born; they\xe2\x80\x99ll create the greatest scenes ever possible; they\xe2\x80\x99ll show-off the maximum\xe2\x80\xa6 All these possibil\xe2\x80\xa6[end of tape 1 side 2]\n[tape 2 side 1]\n\xe2\x80\xa6everyone individually: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you can do about Sahaja Yoga.\xe2\x80\x9d Make the list of people whom you are going to bring. Only those who come once to church\xe2\x80\xa6 on\xe2\x80\xa6 Christmas \xe2\x80\x93 may send their subscription every Sunday, also some of them do \xe2\x80\x93 are alright, can bring up the rear, of Sahaja Yoga. But such a rear can be a load, just a load, unless and until we have a real force in front. So you have to decide whether you are going to be just a load on Mataji that, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come here\xe2\x80\xa6 My father is ill my mother is ill my brother is ill,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cget me a job and do this and do that\xe2\x80\xa6 I must have\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d all these things are just good-for-nothing, useless. To My mind, it is absolutely useless. They have no meaning; I just do not think much of them. But now if you say, \xe2\x80\x98alright, I am willing to do this and that for you,\xe2\x80\x99 in the same way, with others also, you should talk in such a way\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98Why you are bothering about these thing? What is it so important? What have you to do\xe2\x80\xa6 in life? When you start talking like that your wisdom, your greatness, everything will be appreciated. The gurus, have to know from where their power has come and they must have their ideal corrected. They should study Me, how I talk to people, how I show My complete ignorance even if I know that they are horribly caught up and\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99d never tell them that \xe2\x80\x9cyou are possessed\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 never \xe2\x80\x93 till absolutely they start shaking their heads and, absolutely they go beyond. I\xe2\x80\x99d never tell them personally. In the same way you should not, also, suddenly say to somebody \xe2\x80\x9cyou are possessed,\xe2\x80\x9d because that may, absolutely upset people. Any curt answer, any sharp answer, is not going to help. Is a thing you must understand, you see is a gurudom, is different and to be a guru is different. You have to be extremely soft, and very sweet, otherwise these mad caps, they\xe2\x80\x99ll all run away and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be destroyed. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know they\xe2\x80\x99re good, you have to tell them they\xe2\x80\x99re good, you have to talk to them sweetly; you have to do everything, go all out, bring them out, and do it. So today all of you have to take a vow, that you are all gurus and so, you are going to show\xe2\x80\xa6 that you have, manifested, your guru-ness. When I come back, I want to see what have you done about it. All of you should get to it.\nMay God bless you.\n\n[4 MP3]\nShri Mataji : Any questions? Food can be served also\xe2\x80\xa6 Any questions\xe2\x80\xa6 Must ask questions you see? Because in the reaching of Sahaja Yoga you have problems.\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, what do the born-Realized have that we don\xe2\x80\x99t, and what do we have that the born-Realized don\xe2\x80\x99t?\nShri Mataji : Born Realized are the people who were Realized long time back, before they were born in this lifetime. So they clear out much faster than you do, because they have done the clearing before also, so they clear out very fast. They normally do not take to all the perversions and all the temptations that you take to, and they are very different type of people. They are unique and cynical because when they are born they find the rest of them are going the other way and they don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to deal with the others, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to deal with the others and deal with the situation. They become cynical, and they have their own ideas, and maybe these born Realized might develop their ego, also, quite a lot.\nNormally they do not take to temptations \xe2\x80\x93 normally \xe2\x80\x93 but if they go to it, they will see to it that they have it fully, and, while you people have a very great capacity for one thing, because you know your Realization, it happened in your own awareness, when you were aware of it, you saw the happening. So you understand the value of it. Supposing you are born in a rich family, then you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the value of richness. But supposing you are not born in a rich family and suddenly you get lot of riches, then you can compare what I was and what I am. In the same way in Sahaja Yoga when you are not Realized and you get Realization, you can compare. And then the value of Realization is much greater for a Sahaja Yogi than for a just a Realized soul, even if some Realized souls also may understand but they are more individualistic, they are not so much collective, as you people are.\nSecondly, because you have gone through that, in this lifetime and in your own memory all the wrong things you have done, you have much more compassion and understanding for other people, who have got these things. While these who are Realized people do not have much of that patience for others and they have their own way of doing things. If they come to Sahaja Yoga they could be very dynamic and very great, no doubt. But they will not take to Sahaja Yoga easily because they think they are alright: "Why should we accept anything else now? " Because, sort of, they are satisfied people. But they cannot help the humanity unless and until they learn the thing. Like a man, say, who\xe2\x80\x99s very clever, very intelligent, is a child born, very intelligent. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to go to a school. But he misses all the other things of the school: the discipline of the school, the complete knowledge of the school. He maybe alright I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s quite intelligent, but he lacks all that, which one can get it in a school in a proper way. Apart from that he lacks that companionship, with Me. Because I have given you Realization, so you feel Me much more than they can.\nSupposing a child is born to a mother and the child has not seen the mother, then that child cannot have that feeling for a mother as you people can have. So this is the greatest thing that you have got. And if the Realized, born Realized also, try to stick on to Sahaja Yoga they will also develop the same feeling, and then the joy starts pouring in, because you start seeing how your Mother looks after you, at every moment, how She creates play and how She creates magic, because you forget your Mother when She- I have not given you Realization you forget Her. You think: " Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m already Realized" sort of thing comes in you.\n\nShri Mataji : What other question?\nSahaja Yogi: It\xe2\x80\x99s probably a silly question, but can self-Realization ever be lost, can you loose it, when given it.\nShri Mataji: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a silly question, it is not.\nYou see, it is like this: when you become a human being, you are born as a human child alright? But supposing the child is put in company of the foxes, the child grows like a fox. Then, it does not have human awareness, it has the foxes\xe2\x80\x99 awareness, but the body is that of a fox. [Human ?] In the same way you are Realized when you have jumped into another superhuman awareness. But if you do not allow it to grow properly, it has to grow still, and it has to grow, otherwise it won\xe2\x80\x99t be manifesting itself. So that\xe2\x80\x99s how it can be lost, in the sense that, you have to be born again and again it can come up. And it is lost in many.\nIntellectuals?\nBig problem. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Because I have never known, such silly people before, you know. This lifetime only I am seeing such silly people and idiotic ones. Those who get Realization also don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the value of Realization. Can you think of such people any time ?\n\nAlso Realization can be lost, say, after Realization you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like drinking much or something and you try to force yourself and try to become a bad person again and again. Then the Kundalini may not rise and that\xe2\x80\x99s how, though there will be an opening but Kundalini won\xe2\x80\x99t rise, at all. Can happen. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known many people. I mean, this is something so new, you know? In Kali Yuga everything is funny, but this is the funniest thing. Really. I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised. I\xe2\x80\x99m myself surprised at people, that they have got Realization; they\xe2\x80\x99ll come to program; they\xe2\x80\x99ll give Realization to ten people and then settle back \xe2\x80\x93 losing all their vibrations. There are. Quite funny type you know. This Kali Yuga has created such combinations and permutations. Endless! It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to understand them.\nSo, the question is not silly at all, because you see, silly people are there. They think it fits in there. It is true \xe2\x80\x93 very sad \xe2\x80\x93 but it is. It happens. Such set of people. I mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t think of such set of people. I mean I never dreamt that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting such people. I thought \xe2\x80\x9cOnce I give them realization they\xe2\x80\x99ll be just Sahaj Yogis, very nice\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d you know. Here I was, you know, like have you seen any\xe2\x80\xa6 any fruit becoming a flower? Ha! I mean, really! This reversion is possible I never knew but human beings with their ego can do this reversion also. They have achieved it. [Mother laughs] You know after a egg is hatched the chick comes out, it cannot become an egg, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But it does in human beings. They are silly people My child I know, you are correct, that is true it can be lost. It has been lost in so many of them. So you should tell them is better, you see the only way\xe2\x80\xa6 advantage of this you can frighten them. You see \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do like this otherwise it will be lost.\xe2\x80\x9d Then they\xe2\x80\x99ll be alright. If they care for it. But human beings have become very superficial they just don\xe2\x80\x99t care, much. You tell them \xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do like this, is wrong\xe2\x80\x9d they\xe2\x80\x99ll say \xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThen why are you doing it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d\nNow what do you know? Now you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to talk to such people. Some of them are about to go to lunatic asylum. Or perhaps they are not yet in, and we are facing them. Some of them are like that. Half nit\xe2\x80\xa6wits and what d\xe2\x80\x99you call them, all kinds. One thing you must know, that the people who ride the ego are mostly those who are archbishops of idiocity. And with the idiots if you deal, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they will do. So it can be. You see an idiot you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s up to. How can you see? For a sane person it is very difficult. But I have seen it, happening. They look very sensible, when they talk, but they\xe2\x80\x99re idiots. You give them a diamond, tell them \xe2\x80\x9cthis is diamond, look after it,\xe2\x80\x9d they\xe2\x80\x99ll throw it away. In that they think \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have been a very detached person. I\xe2\x80\x99m not interested even in my self-realization.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe this is the justification. I cannot explain, but it is true. But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I will manage them also \xe2\x80\x93 after some time. But they are headaches, you know? They are headaches. So first try simpler words, then the difficult ones. Always try first simpler words.\n[You?] can see through vibrations; you know everything; you know how you are placed and how they are placed; with vibration you can fathom out your own achievements you can\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean you know your moorings you know, I mean relative position \xc3\x82- everything you know. So there is no problem and you know such a lot.\nHm what other question? [Marathi word "wathaapini?"]\nBala? So \xe2\x80\x9cHere you are,\xe2\x80\x9d as Bala has said in one of his letters that a man has to have three things. One rare thing is that he should be born a human being. Is very rare. Second rare thing that he should have desire to meet God, and the third is to get a good guru. Here three things have happened\xe2\x80\xa6 (you have got realization also), then what are we doing? This is the question. I mean everything has happened I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s all there! And what do you do? You give the light. Now they say are we\xe2\x80\xa6 now maybe I have enlightened you. Then what do you do? Give the light! Finished! Keep your lamp clean, and give the light. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. Nothing else is needed. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t take your light into some corner, or hide it under the sofa.\nAre you better now. How are you? Good. Are you alright now? You, good. David?\nDavid: Yes I am, Mother.\nShri Mataji: Oh. That David also is he alright?\nDavid2 [Scottish accent?]: I was just thinking about what you\xe2\x80\x99d said Mother. How can we help people who are born realized? But, they playing hard to get, they won\xe2\x80\x99t come into Sahaja Yoga.\nShri Mataji: I know they are very -\nDavid2: How can we help them?\nShri Mataji: They should help themselves, David. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother your head. Now this Mr. Gent [said as in "get"] of yours or Gent [said as in "jet"] or whatever his name is. He\xe2\x80\x99s trying to study all the four, what you call, yogas and this and that and [ON or ALL?]. So what is he doing now? This is Mahayoga all the things are inside it and now he should come down to do these things. He just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to meet Me. He\xe2\x80\x99s avoiding. What can you do about him? Look at them. He\xe2\x80\x99s more on a supraconscious style, you see? And the Raja Yoga and all that is all humbug, is all nonsense they have written, absolute nonsense it is. That\xe2\x80\x99s not Raja Yoga at all! It\xe2\x80\x99s all misappropriation and, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to call it like\xe2\x80\xa6 You see as I was telling, the other day, it\xe2\x80\x99s written that, in Sanskrit language, that when the Kundalini rises, She become Kriyavati, Gyanavati and all that. Means She become active \xe2\x80\x93 activity comes into her. So, according to Raja Yogis, when Kundalini rises you start jumping like a monkey. It is not! But it means then the activity comes into you that you start moving the Kundalini of others. That\xe2\x80\x99s how they formed a huge big area of the so-called Raja Yogis. They said this is Raja Yoga.\nYogini [Italian?]: Mother, can we work on other people\xe2\x80\x99s Kundalini when they are not aware of it?\nShri Mataji: Yes yes, that you can raise but -\nYogini: \xe2\x80\xa6[WHEN WE...not clear] find it easier to do it this way, because some people are \xe2\x80\x93 although they see the beauty of Sahaja Yoga, they\xe2\x80\xa6 they refuse to come into it or have anything to do with it.\nShri Mataji: You raise their Kundalini, then gradually they\xe2\x80\x99ll come. But, you see they have to be aware of their realization; that is a compulsion.\nSahaja Yogini: They do. But I have come across some people that say they feel, so bad in themselves, that they say they\xe2\x80\x99re not ready for it yet.\nShri Mataji: But you should say \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you judge yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSahaja Yogini: Well, hm\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: You can also say like this that \xe2\x80\x9cI used to say\xe2\x80\xa6 say the same thing, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the fashion. But now the time of judgment has come whether your are ready or not.\xe2\x80\x9d Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to pull them out of the graves and judge them.\nSahaja Yogini: So can we just put the\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: [unclear IF IS?] You will leave it to us whether you are judged\xe2\x80\xa6 you are ready or not. These are all fashions, you know. This is a new style. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not ready. I am very bad Mother. I am good for nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99m useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSahaja Yogini: Some of them, Mother, they are too young that they feel that by coming nearer to God, they lose some of their freedom as young people. You understand. It\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to say it indifferently but\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the purity of the person, and \xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: This is the problem. You should tell them that by\xe2\x80\xa6 You see, freedom is different, and abandonment is different. These are two things. One must understand. Say, there is a kite in the hand, alright? Then it is in your hand. But if you allow the kite to fly it wherever it likes, it is abandonment. So the freedom is that in which you can manage to maneuver it, to man it, to take it the way you like, that is the freedom. Then you are free. But if you are in the hands of these\xe2\x80\xa6 baselessly you are roaming about, then this is abandonment\xe2\x80\xa6 for which there is always a punishment. Like, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed at, in the western country, the percentage of impotent people is so high that \xe2\x80\x93 unbelievably \xe2\x80\x93 it is like that. They talk so much about sex and do this thing is talking [shocking?] It never works out. So much of impotency is settled in these western countries. The diseases, the dirty diseases, which are caused by, these indiscriminate sex activities, are so much in percentage, that one has to be guarded against. You see if somebody says \xe2\x80\x9cgive me freedom to put my both the hands inside the circuit of electricity,\xe2\x80\x9d is that freedom? And I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what is the freedom they enjoy like this.\n\nBecause there is jealousy, you cannot go about with many girls. There is jealousy; you cannot go about with many boys. There can be murders, you see. Why people murder these days? Their ego is hurt. Even with all this you see some, any drama or play and you see [IT?], you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed, there is always a feeling of\xe2\x80\xa6 Nobody says \xe2\x80\x9cAlright you have a boyfriend? Go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy\xe2\x80\x9d I have not heard anyone saying that. No one likes it \xe2\x80\x93 it hurts! They do it secretly. They cannot do it openly. If it is freedom it should be open. Why there is secrecy about it. They\xe2\x80\x99ll hide from the man with whom they are connected, and just do it secretly. This is not good. They are deceiving themselves; they were deceiving another person. Deception! And this is no freedom. Supposing like a thief comes in and wants to run away with something. He says \xe2\x80\x9cI should have freedom to take away.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s like that! When you put your eyes on somebody, who belongs to someone else, then you are thieving. In the registration office it is said that this belongs to me. Then that is mine. In the same way in the registration office it is said that you are the wife of such-and-such, then your husband is the owner. Or you are the owner of your husband. I mean this relationship is between the two.\n\nBut now supposing there is some sort of a relationship to be established like a thief, then you do it secretly. You understand My point? It is not registered anywhere else. Otherwise they become absolutely shameless, abandoned, and then all of them end up in the orphanages, at the age of forty-five years \xe2\x80\x93 looking like old, dilapidated, secluded, excluded, what other name is, cut-off people. So to deal with reality must be done with intensity. Even love must be intense. Otherwise you are just befooling yourself playing games. You see they just want to play games. It leads them nowhere. So this is not freedom, this is tomfoolery. It is making fool of yourself. It\xe2\x80\x99s only you identification. Freedom means freedom to ego, not to wisdom.\n\nSahaja Yogi [French Yogi, Patrice]: Mother do we have powers to kill rakshasas?\nShri Mataji: Of course. You have. You have killed also so many of them. This is the minimum power you are.\nSahaja Yogini: [INAUDIBLE - something to do with using "mardini" from the negativity destroying mantras together with someone\'s name?]\nShri Mataji: You coin a mardini with anyone \xe2\x80\x93 finished. You see it is like this: I\xe2\x80\x99m entitled, you see. I am the One who has killed all of them. So I\xe2\x80\x99m entitled. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the title, you see, if you take My name title they finish off there. All their powers are dropping down; so you use that; you have been empowered. Otherwise how do you save these TM people, these people that people? Poor things they are under the grip of these horrible rakshasas.\nPatrice: Then they are finished, they don\xe2\x80\x99t come in another form?\nShri Mataji: No, I mean\xe2\x80\xa6 You see they have so many other, styles of things, but you definitely kill some of them. Like in the war, you see? You are killing the enemies. You kill one, then another soldier, third soldier, forth soldier, like that.\n\nSahaja Yogini:[italian] Mother, what shoebeating does to a person who is full of catches and bhoots? If we should shoebeat a person who is full of\xe2\x80\xa6?\nShri Mataji: No, d\xe2\x80\x99you see we should remove our interest a little bit, and give the photograph. Let them work on photograph, If they are not interested in photograph, just forget the person. You should not show interest in people who have no interested in the photograph. See that\xe2\x80\x99s the best way. Why unnecessarily waste your energy?\n\nSahaja Yogini: What happens if these people are in immediate contact with us, like living with us? We cannot just, you know, ignore these people, I mean\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: No you, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to you about these things, Try to cut off from them, and also tell Me their names: I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage them.\n[Laughter]\nSahaja Yogini: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling You the names to get rid of it?\n[Laughter]\nShri Mataji: No, no, no. Give Me in writing, you see. Give Me in writing and give Me a photograph. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage.\n\nSahaja Yogi: I\xe2\x80\x99m living with some\nShri Mataji: Hum?\nSahaja Yogi: I\xe2\x80\x99m living with some.\nShri Mataji: Alright? You give Me the names.\n[Shri Mataji laughs]\nSahaja Yogi: No Ma, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been living with them for six years.\nShri Mataji: Yes, but you give Me the names, and the thing, I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage them.\nCan I have my sweater, it\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nSahaja Yogi: No, I mean there\xe2\x80\x99s no need Mother.\nShri Mataji: Hum?\nSahaja Yogi: There\xe2\x80\x99s no need, You know?\nShri Mataji: There\xe2\x80\x99s no need at all. Forget them. You see no need to do that, firstly. Secondly is that you learn you see they\xe2\x80\x99re a good subject to learn. You see otherwise how will you know what sort of people they are?\nSahaja Yogi: All right.\nShri Mataji: My sweater? Oh, there\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happening to the biryani? The first attempt was biryani, [Mother laughs] and they asked Me the recipe, and \xe2\x80\x93 God save them \xe2\x80\x93 I told them that \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t try all these things,\xe2\x80\x9d but they said \xe2\x80\x9cNo. we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xe2\x80\x9d So, they must have done something. Just give Me.)\nYou see among yourself only you can find out. Just now they say \xe2\x80\x9cHow Kuli has answered the question.\xe2\x80\x9d Just don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. (Who is there?) You are living with stones and you are living with so many other things. This\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nSahaja Yogini [Italian]: But, don\xe2\x80\x99t You think Mother of the children? Through their innocence they have more chances to get their Realization faster than the adults?\nShri Mataji: Children?\nSahaja Yogini: Yes.\nShri Mataji: Yes they can. But I mean, some children can be very nasty, can be horrible.\nCan you close the window?\nSahaja Yogi: shut the curtain rather.\nShri Mataji: Better, let him do it. No-no I think better [unclear words]. Sit down, sit down. Kya hala tumhara. Aap teek ho gay?\nRustom: Abhi Ma. Almost. Hundred percent.\nShri Mataji Acha? Hundred percent. Sab pal tumha kya ha le. Aap teek ho gay? Bal tum lo gay si dira dev chalte ho\xe2\x80\xa6\n[...Mother continues in Hindi and calls in Marathi to the Maharashtrians at the back of the room]\nThey can\xe2\x80\x99t hear Me. [Marathi words]\nRustom: Mataji, shall we bring the khana here before Your feet?\nShri Mataji: Ha?\nRustom: Shall we bring the food before Your feet?\nShri Mataji: Kya what is it?\nRustom: Shall we bring the food here, before Your feet?\nShri Mataji: All right, if you want to. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need. You do one thing, you take it.\nSahaja Yogi [offering food]: Mix something with it?\nShri Mataji: No that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Can I give it in something so that you can\xe2\x80\xa6just pour it in. Yes please.\nSahaja Yogi [French]: Peter is back.\nShri Mataji: [Marathi words]. Very well done. Rustom? You have done it very well.\nRustom: The ladies should be thanked Mother. Maureen and Cathy.\n\nShri Mataji: Very good. Little salt is needed.\nRustom: Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. I thought so too.\nShri Mataji: Very well done.\nNichessa purani kallo? [Marathi words] That is how we all meet and love each other and -nice isn\xe2\x80\x99t it.\nSahaja Yogi [Patrice]: Djamel is going to have an army of Ayatollahs on their backs.\n[Laughter]\nDjamel: No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to suggest the ideology around here, because all the Ayatollahs are going to be trapped by the Americans.\nShri Mataji: You know but, I must say I was surprised \xe2\x80\x93 thanks to you \xe2\x80\x93 that your President has done something about it. He\xe2\x80\x99s very much different. You know, he has helped President Carter in some way, because President Carter has thanked him very much. Your President. Algerian.\nDjamel: Not supporting the-\nShri Mataji: No he has said something by which he, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, for some \xe2\x80\x9cunknown reasons\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote, that President Carter thanked the President of Algeria.\nBut what do you think about this mosque? What are they doing there?\nWho could these be people?\nPatrice: It\xe2\x80\x99s a new messiah. Mother. one more.\nDjamel: I think they\xe2\x80\x99re probably from the Muslim Brothers you know they\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: From the?\nDjamel: There\xe2\x80\x99s a sect called the \xe2\x80\x9cMuslim Brothers\xe2\x80\x9d you see they\xe2\x80\x99re very extremist\nShri Mataji: More than these?\nDjamel: Oh, of course. More than these Ayatollahs.\nShri Mataji: They are from what country, from\xe2\x80\xa6?\nDjamel: Oh, they\xe2\x80\x99re everywhere, mainly in Egypt.\nSahaja Yogi1: Egypt,\nShri Mataji: But Egyptians are against this.\nDjamel: We have them mostly in Algeria, but they are not regarded, well regarded by people also\nShri Mataji: What do they do, murders and things?\nDjamal: No, they just have their own fanatic ways, you see? And sometimes they can be violent. Like in Egypt, they have been very violent.\nShri Mataji: Acha. I mean they have those weapons and things with them?\nDjamel: No Not, not, not generally no. But they are capable, yeach. If someone tries to lead them, to lead them or something or other they can\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: Like we had\xe2\x80\xa6\nDjamel: Organizing of so many coup d\xe2\x80\x99Etats, you see.\nShri Mataji: [To someone else] But dhal has salt quite a lot, tell them. So if you mix it up with dhal, you need not have salt.\n\nSomething like \xe2\x80\x9cAnand Marg\xe2\x80\x9d we had in India?\nDjamel: But nobody, in Algeria, nobody really likes the Iranians anymore.\nShri Mataji: Ah?\nDjamel: They don\xe2\x80\x99t like this Ayatollah anymore.\nShri Mataji: I think so\xe2\x80\xa6\nDjamel: They think\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: I mean they have really insulted God!\nDjamel: I mean\xe2\x80\xa6 He thinks God is only for the Muslims, you know.\n\nShri Mataji: Oh look at our Pakistanis. You know Americans always supported Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis against India. Americans always have a speciality of always supporting wrong people.\n[Laughter]\nThen they withdraw, but always I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why they do it.\nDjamel: Mother, you see why, because the Muslims usually are against the Russians you see, so they like the Muslims. But then you see, ? Vietnam? did not work out.\nShri Mataji: Ah.\nDjamel: You see Communism supposed to stand for atheism.\nShri Mataji: Acha.\nNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very generalized way of saying, that, because they are Muslims, they will be against Russians or they will be for Russians for Americans.\nSahaja Yogi: The majority are against the Russians because they\xe2\x80\xa6I mean they\xe2\x80\x99re against\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99cause when You were saying\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: Because they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in religion.\nSahaja Yogi: Yea\xe2\x80\xa6Whenever someone says \xe2\x80\x9cCommunism,\xe2\x80\x9d automatically its\xe2\x80\xa6\nSahaja Yogini: Atheism\xe2\x80\xa6yea.\nShri Mataji: But, against India, they have been always. Americans have been very much against India, and against favoring these two countries in the international fields. Even Ceylon\xe2\x80\xa6\nSahaja Yogi: Will be supporting\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: Even Ceylon, you know. They created all enemies for India to deal with.\n\nIf fearing God, fearing people are to be supported, then Indians are very God-fearing.\nAmericans are not.\n\nSahaja Yogini [Italian]: Mother, can we use some of that salt for our food?\nShri Mataji: Hum?\nSahaja Yogini: Can we use some of that salt?\nShri Mataji: Nicely made. Eh?\nSahaja Yogini: Yeach.\nShri Mataji: They wrote down they whole thing.\n\nSahaja Yogi [French]: It\xe2\x80\x99s the first puja where we sing something properly Mother.\nShri Mataji: Hm?\nSahaja Yogi2: It was the first puja here where we sung something properly.\nShri Mataji: Gavin practices. I was so enamored and so much, I must say very pleasantly surprised, the way you sung the Marathi aarti. How did you get it? I\xe2\x80\x99m just\xe2\x80\xa6\nSahaja Yogini: When we were in India we got it.\nShri Mataji: Aacha.\nGavin: We also had a tape, so we checked.\nShri Mataji: Good. What about these Maharashtrian ladies. Have they gone? Or they are there?\nSahaja Yogi: Yea they were\nShri Mataji: Ha?\nSahaja Yogi: No, they at the back Mother.\nShri Mataji: They have brought something [...Mother converses briefly in Marathi with those at the back...] Every body should have something to eat.\nNabhi is very much vibrating. Lower Nabhi.\nKuli, some water for Me, to drink. Water.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother. How can we help people who are born Realized, who meditate with the photograph but cannot feel the vibrations.\nShri Mataji: Can\xe2\x80\x99t feel?\nSahaja Yogi: Can\xe2\x80\x99t feel the cool breeze.\nShri Mataji: How do you say he\xe2\x80\x99s born Realized.\nSahaja Yogi: feel cool from on the palm from there.\nShri Mataji: Ha?\nSahaja Yogi: I feel cool on the palms from this person.\nShri Mataji: But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t accept Me, he cannot feel the cool breeze from Me.\nSahaja Yogi [Scottish?]: This particular person has got the cool breeze, once or twice, the cool. Just feel it and then not very\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: That means he has to accept Me much more.\nSahaja Yogi: Pardon?\nShri Mataji: He has to accept Me. He has to accept Me much more.\nSahaja Yogi: That may be the problem Mother, but this person hasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually had the chance to meet You yet.\nShri Mataji: If that\xe2\x80\x99s all, then he will get it when he\xe2\x80\x99ll meet Me.\nSahaja Yogi: I mean he\xe2\x80\x99s vegetarian.\n\nShri Mataji: You see, when he\xe2\x80\x99ll meet Me, he has to accept Me. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t accept Me he cannot get cool breeze. Deities know. Deities know about it.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a simple example: We had a visitor in our house, his name wa, what was it? \xe2\x80\x9cShaha.\xe2\x80\x9d What was his name, Mukud? Your friend.\nSahaja Yogi: Mukuncha\nShri Mataji: Mukuncha, Mukuncha. He had his Realization and everything, he was a Sahaj Yogi, came to see Me but I was having My bath. So he went upstairs and this Ganesha was kept there. And he started feeling his own vibrations, he never got any vibrations, nothing. He was surprised, he got a shock. He thought that \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has happened\xe2\x80\x9d has he lost all his vibrations? And Ganesha would not give any vibrations to him.\nSo he came down, I\xe2\x80\x99d finished My bath, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What is what I did,\xe2\x80\x9d He didn\xe2\x80\x99t even touch My feet he was so frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my vibrations; I can\xe2\x80\x99t feel any vibrations from Ganesha!\xe2\x80\x9d I said \xe2\x80\x98Really?\xe2\x80\x9d He said \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d I said \xe2\x80\x9cYou touch My feet and now go and see.\xe2\x80\x9d He touched My feet; he went up, and the vibrations were alright. I said \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows Me. You must touch My feet first otherwise He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to give you vibrations too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSahaja Yogi: This person now I was talking about Mother, lives in Scotland, quite a long way off \xe2\x80\x93 so it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. But they, they not well-off. They\xe2\x80\x99re on social security. So, this person can\xe2\x80\x99t come down to see you.\nShri Mataji: I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Glasgow, some day. And tell him to accept Me, more and more. Then his conditions will improve. Why is he on social security?\nSahaja Yogi: It\xe2\x80\x99s a lady, and her husbands on social security. He\xe2\x80\x99s deaf and it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for him to get a job in Scotland.\nShri Mataji: Haven\xe2\x80\x99t they got a job? They should try for a job. Also social security people don\xe2\x80\x99t get vibrations. Very true. You see, you are not to be parasite on your society.\nYogi: He\xe2\x80\x99s not a parasite Mother. He trying to get jobs there. But, because of his infirmity, his deafness.\nShri Mataji: No once in a while is alright if you\xe2\x80\xa6but you must be trying for a job, I mean he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that kind of a life. Alright? So you tell him both the things, that "You must find out a good job for yourself", as well as \xe2\x80\x93 in this country is not difficult to make money, really not too difficult.\nSahaja Yogi: It is in Scotland, it\xe2\x80\x99s more difficult than it is here, Mother.\nShri Mataji: No, I mean \xe2\x80\x93\nSahaja Yogi: \xe2\x80\xa6shortage of jobs there. Specially for people\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: Even if you do baby-sitting, you can make money here. You can. You see if you want to live on\xe2\x80\xa6because of the social thing you have got it, you depend on it.\nSahaja Yogi: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them Mother to do about it\nShri Mataji: But don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him like that, he\xe2\x80\x99ll feel hurt. You just tell him that \xe2\x80\x9cMataji was saying \xe2\x80\x98you should try to accept Me more\xe2\x80\x99 and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get him a job also.\xe2\x80\x9d He will find his job.\n(Can I wash, wipe My hands)\nSahaja Yogi: Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s the wife who was meditating, and her husband I think is born Realized too, but, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meditate regularly. But he\xe2\x80\x99s got the cool breeze.\nShri Mataji: Oh I see. He\xe2\x80\x99ll come round, don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry. What\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\nSahaja Yogi: The husband\xe2\x80\x99s name is Tom.\nShri Mataji: Tom.\nSahaja Yogi: The wife is Jetta.\nShri Mataji: What\xe2\x80\x99s it?\nSahaja Yogi: The wife is Jetta.\nShri Mataji: Jetta. Alright. You see they have to accept Me, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing is. Many people, They get vibrations, say, from Gavin, but not from Me. There are some like that!\n\nKuli: Sorry, Mataji?\nShri Mataji: Hum.\nKuli: I said to one man, \xe2\x80\x9csee if you can feel the vibrations from this photograph?\xe2\x80\x9d you see? He said \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in photographs.\xe2\x80\x9d So as a joke, then I said to him, see if you can feel them from Me?\xe2\x80\x9d He was willing to that, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t willing to put his hands to the photograph.\nShri Mataji: See! He, Gavi, he\xe2\x80\x99s telling us a concrete result. He\xe2\x80\x99s saying that there was someone whom he said that \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you see your vibrations from the photograph ? If you get the vibrations.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he said \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in photographs, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d So he said \xe2\x80\x9cAlright, you put your hands towards me if you get the cool breeze. He put his hands to Kuli but he would not put to the photograph. Though Kuli would put his hands but he would not.\nKuli: You know I said to him \xe2\x80\x9cI got it from the photograph,\xe2\x80\x9d and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put his hands to the photograph.\nShri Mataji [laughing]: Typical. We have another one in India. Like Rajesh. He has got two sister-in-laws and they said that \xe2\x80\x9cwe feel cool breeze from you, but not from [the photograph] \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nH. H.
