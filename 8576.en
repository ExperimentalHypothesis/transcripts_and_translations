1987-08-06 The Future of America (4 minutes) & Music by Yogis

I am really overwhelmed, really overwhelmed by your love and devotion.May God bless you.

You don’t know how happy I feel to be with you here. And I have been rather very upset about the future of America, the way things are moving. I’ve been thinking what should we do? Should we take all the Sahaj Yogis from here to India and settle there?[Applause]Or bring more Sahaja Yogis from abroad to strengthen you here. It’s very sad that there are so many Americans whom we have not been able to locate and that they are lost somewhere. You have to find means and ways of bringing them. After seeing you I see a great hope.

I hope all of us put together, we will do something great. We will be able to get some more and more Americans. How many times I have been here? But was difficult. Let us see what we can do. I do not know if they have scheduled Me to come this year again. If they have, I might come for 2-3 days to San Diego again and we may have a nice public program here.But first of all, you all have to prepare yourself. You have to be very, very much embedded in Sahaj Yoga, just like lotuses. So that people feel the fragrance of your presence and they come to achieve their Self-realization and to enjoy life as you all are enjoying. You have to pray for it, you have to meditate for it. I am sure maybe this year I might come again for at least 3-4 days here.May God bless you.

I hope you are enjoying this house which I saw just, in a short time. I didn’t know what sort of house it is and I hope you are comfortable. Now I didn’t know what to buy for this Ashram. So, I have got a little present for you. And then [name of yogi ] told Me that this is the only thing that is less in Ashram. So, I said, "All right, it’s a good idea ".So, how many are staying in this Ashram? Raise your hands.Sahaja Yogi: How many are staying here?Shri Mataji: And the rest are staying alone or separately or they have another Ashram?Sahaja Yogi: We have another small collective, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: Huh?Sahaja Yogi: We have another small collective and people are living separately.Shri Mataji: I see.Another Sahaja Yogi: We come from Canada, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?Sahaja Yogi: A lot of people have come from Canada also.Shri Mataji: Today?Another Sahaja Yogi: Vancouver, from Vancouver they have come.Sahaja Yogini: Santa Cruz.Shri Mataji: Ah! I see all the way.Is Vancouver close to this place?Sahaja Yogi: Quite far.Shri Mataji: As much close as it is to London, is it?[Shri Mataji laughs][Marathi: "What's the program now?"] What’s the program now?[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi: "Please give me some water"]Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, the musicians have been practicing. So, whenever You are ready, we can have them.Shri Mataji: I’m ready.Sahaja Yogi: OK. 

Shri Mataji: I am sorry for being late but we had to go and buy these presents for you. And then we got delayed.Shri Mataji: So, I already asked for water [unsure] Let’s have the music[In Marathi: "Please give me water and tea. First, I would like to have some water and then tea".]

[The singer is praising Lord Rama. Shri Mataji says in Hindi that the singer has a beautiful voice. (Applause). She further adds that the singer’s voice has the beauty of a Bengali singer. Then Shri Mataji asks a Yogini about what does the singer do for living, if he is teaching or singing here. The answer is not clear.]

I am very happy you are learning our music is and it’s such a rare thing to hear such a beautiful music.

[In Marathi, Shri Mataji asks a Sahaja Yogini if her little daughter is crying.  The Yogini replies that she just got up when Shri Mataji arrived, and that she normally does not get up at this time. Shri Mataji asks Sharayu aunty for her spectacles. A Sahaja Yogini tells Shri Mataji that the singer sings very well.]

[Shri Mataji in Hindi:Shri Mataji: Does she herself give singing lessons to you?Sahaja Yogini: Yes.Shri Mataji: Where does the singer stay?Sahaja Yogini: In the university.Shri Mataji: In Santa Cruz?Sahaja Yogini: No, in San Diego. Once the Yogis had received an advertisement in their mail box from them. They wanted to give lessons in Indian music. Some of the Yogis were attending these private singing lessons.Shri Mataji: So, they are giving private lessons and also teaching in the university?Sahaja Yogini: Yes, they do bothShri Mataji: Her voice is really sweet. it’s god’s gift.Sahaja Yogini: The singer is from Calcutta following "Durga mata, Kali mata". Inaudible.]

[Shri Mataji in Hindi:

Shri Mataji: (To the singer) You teach also so well and sing so well. You have a very good voice. I could not imagine that in such a place (USA) we can find such good singers. Very good.Singer: Thank youShri Mataji: (To the singer): Do you teach here also?Singer: We have started a school in which we are teaching.Shri Mataji: It’s a good thing.Singer: My husband teaches instrumental music. we need your blessings.Shri Mataji: My blessings are always there for music and also for you.]

It’s very, very rare to hear such beautiful voices and such beautiful music, you are very lucky people I wish others could also have it in America to have someone like that to teach the music and. You find it very interesting? it’s difficult also. Indian music is very difficult.

[Shri Mataji speaks in HindiShri Mataji: Who is he?Sahaja Yogini: He is the husbandShri Mataji: May God bless you.Shri Mataji (to the yogini): Are they from Calcutta?Shri Mataji (to the husband singer): This Yogini is praising you. It’s really surprising that you have come so far and trying to spread your music. It’s a very beautiful thing.Singer (in English): I have my music so that’s the only way to pray to God.Shri Mataji: that’s the best way to pray, isn’t it?Singer (in Hindi): If you permit, I would like to play some more music.Shri Mataji: Of course, you can playShri Mataji (to the Yogini in Marathi): They are very young.Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother they are young.Shri Mataji: How did they come to the us?Sahaja Yogini: As studentsShri Mataji: Yes, to study. Who is playing the tablas?Shri Mataji is inquiring about a Yogi who was to come but was not there.Sahaja Yogini: They live in San Francisco].

May God Bless you
