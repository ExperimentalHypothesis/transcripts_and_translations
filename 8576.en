1987-08-06 The Future of America (4 minutes) & Music by Yogis

I am really overwhelmed , really overwhelmed by your love and devotionMay God bless you.You don't know how happy I feel to be with you here,I have been rather very upset about the future of America , the way things are moving . I [UNCLEAR have been/mean] thinking what should we do , should we take all the sahaj yogies from here to India and settle there or bring more sahaj yogies from abroad to strengthen [UNCLEAR] its very sad that there are so many Americans whom we have not been able to locate and that they are lost somewhere you have to find ways and ways of bringing them.After seeing you I see, agreed?I hope all of us put together we will do something great , we will be able to get some more and more Americans .How many times I have been here but was difficult.Let us see what we can do , I do not know if they have scheduled me to come this year again if they have I might come for 2-3 days to San diego again and we may have a nice public program here.But first of all you all have to prepare yourself,you have to be very,very much embedded into Sahaj yoga just like lotuses so that people feel the fragrance of your presence and they come to achieve their self realization and to enjoy life as you all are enjoying , you have to pray for it,you have to meditate for it I am sure maybe this year I might come again for at least 3-4 days here.May God bless you.I hope you are enjoying this house which I saw just ,in a short time , I didn't know what sort of house it is and I hope you are comfortable. Now I didn't know what to buy for this Ashram so I have got a little present for you. And then [name of yogi ] told me that this is the only thing that is less in Ashram so I said alright it's a good idea.So how many are staying in this Ashram raise your hands. And the rest are staying alone or separately or they have another Ashram [Shaja yogi responds - separate asham and lots of people have come from santacruz , canada Vancouver]I see ,pardonAhh!see all the way ,Is Vancouver close to this place?[yogi replies - quite far]as much close as it is to London is it [mataji laughs][mataji talking in marathi]What's the program now?[mataji talking in marathi]I am sorry for being late but [UNCLEAR they/we] had to go and buy these presents for you and then we got delayed.Let's have the music[mataji talking in marathi]Shree Mataji praises singer yogini in HindiI am very happy you are learning our music is and it's such a rare thing to hear such a beautiful music ,[Mataji in hindi ] it's very very rare to hear such beautiful voices and such beautiful music , you are very lucky people I wish others could also have it in America to have someone like that to teach the music and.You find it very interesting ?it's difficult also.Indian music is very difficult.
