And I have told you Krishna is the ultimate of the fatherhood, before why he was called as "Yeshu" or that I described before you, who came on "Jesu". So today we are going to see to the two aspects of Shri Krishna, which were this Earth and illustrated the ultimate of that. So on this Earth, the highest the manifestation of His divine birth. fatherhood is Shri Krishna's awareness. But in the Kingdom of God, we can say in In Rama's life they showed a man; Heavens, or even above everything else, man, a "Purushottama", the best of the resides Sadashiva who does not take father in wordly affairs. And in Shri incarnations. He is one of the aspects, Shri Krishna's life they showed Him the highest Krishna is one of the aspect of Sadashiva fatherhood as in Yogeshwara or in divine which is the Father. And the Adi Shakti or work. So the first aspect of Shri Krishna the Holy Ghost is the other aspect of we have to understand is the Yogeshwara Sadashiva which is His power.

She is the same who came as Yoga, or the power of Yoga. He is called the Mother of Chirst, and She gave the because He reached the optimum that one name of Christ as the surname of Shri has to reach as a Yogi.

It's not the logic. Some of them pose they are humble; even a rotten fruit bends So you should understand today that down. But the mature fruit shows its humility by its weight. That is the guru tatwa weight. Virata-Shakti is "we are going to worship that Virata Shakti which has given fruits".
