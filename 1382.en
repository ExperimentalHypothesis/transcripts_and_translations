Shri Ganesha Puja, Perth (Australia), 9 February 1992.

It is so joy giving to be back in Australia. When I wanted to come here in this month, Stephen told me that Perth would be scorchingly hot (Laughter) and, “I don't think you should go to Perth first, you can go later.” So I said, “That part you leave it to me! The rest is alright!”

Now you have seen how it rained and rained and rained, because you wanted rain. That was needed very much. And also you wanted a cooler atmosphere. Both things have worked out. But then the worry was that, because of the rain, the seekers won't come. Also that was solved because it was a testing ground. I told them, “If they are real seekers they'll come.” Otherwise what's the use of having a big quantity with no seeking? And see yesterday what beautiful people came! They came all the way in the rain, because they were seekers and very deep seekers. They never even asked a question! Can you imagine, in this Australia, I am always bombarded with questions. And they had told me not to allow them to ask questions But I could feel their seeking so much, that I said, “Better ask me questions.” And not a single question was asked.

So in one shot how many things are done? You got the rain that you needed very much for your trees, for your crops, for your fruits, for everything. And it was most unexpected. And then you got it cooled down so that our programmes could go on well. Then you got the real seekers and the real seeking. But the electricity went off. Now see the good point of electricity, also: because electricity went off, we had those candles and all the bhoots I saw were just burnt with these candles on! And I came in the room [and] they all went, “Buk! buk! Buk!” like that, and I could see why candles had to be put! So, also, that was a good thing that we should rely sometimes on natural things. We are so much dependant on electricity, is not a very good thing. So we should have always provision for something natural. We should keep some lanterns and things and should try to live more with the nature than with this electricity.

I tell you this electricity is responsible for spoiling our eyes very much. Supposing we had used those lights which [the] older generation had used, we would never have strained so much our eyes as we are with this electricity. Because not [only] that it gives us light but also it takes away light from our eyes. So too much use of electricity has made us like slaves to it. As you know that, in America, once the electricity failed and so many people died. So it's more to depend on natural things. And this is a good trend that you have, that you try to have more natural surroundings, more natural places to live in.

So the main thing we have to realise, is that equilibrium that is being worked out by Paramachaitanya. If Paramchaitanya is the power of love of God, then it works out equilibrium. So the Sahaja Yogis who are going to work out Paramchaitanya have to have equilibrium in their life.

This is a place where I say resides Mahaganesha. So we have to understand how Shri Ganesh brings balance in us. It's very important to see that his swastika represents nothing else but balance. Balance when it is steady. When it starts moving in the right direction, then constructive work starts. And also it works out all that is important for life. But when it starts the other way round it works out the destructive part. These both are in balance. If they are not life cannot go on. The constructive and destructive both have to be in balance. If you see in the nature: for example, a  bud has to come, and when the bud dies then the fruit comes out. The tree has to evaporate its water to the sky. If it does not then it won't rain. It won't trigger the rain. But during winter season it has to drop out its leaves, because these leaves have to die and fall on to the ground to nourish the mother nature with nitrogen. Then, during summer time, again they come back.

So the life goes on like this, that, whatever is created is destroyed; something new comes up; again that new thing also comes up in a way that it becomes constructive. And then whatever it has constructed, part of it is destroyed.

So actually, if you see - in the death resides the life. If there is no death - imagine if all the people who were born since long, would have been living today - we would not have been here. It would have been so difficult to manage ourselves with all these people. But so many animals have died and those animals also have become human beings. So many human beings have to die to get other people to come on this Earth. And that you have to take some rest and come back again. So the death is just a change of life. Without death, life cannot exist. It’s a balance between the two. So a Sahaja Yogi should never be afraid of death. He should never be afraid of death. Because if he is going to die it is only going to be another life where he rests for a while and comes back with greater enthusiasm, with greater energy.

So there is a complete balance in nature, if you see. If there was no balance we could not have existed. Supposing the Earth was moving with a greater speed, you would not have existed. If the Pacific Ocean was deeper, even by certain feet, you would not have existed. So many things are completely in balance: the distance with the sun, the distance with the moon. Everything is so much in balance. If this balance breaks then we would be nowhere.

So we have to understand that all this is done by Shri Ganesha. He is the one who looks after all the material things and all the things that are created. For example, the first chakra is created by this Mother Earth and all this universe then, is created by the second chakra. But the first chakra is the one which emits the holiness, the auspiciousness, which gives balance. Auspiciousness comes only through balance. So I find people when they have lost their balances, they go to the Right or to the Left. People are very righteous, extremely righteous, very good Sahaja Yogis, nice, but there is no love. Without love, righteousness has no meaning. Love doesn't mean that you indulge into anything, but you must have detached love and responsibility. So in our life we should see if we have that balance or not. It's very important if we have to see to Shri Ganesh.

Shri Ganesha, as you know, is on Mooladhara, he controls all our senses as far as the Mooladhara is concerned, especially all the excretion. So we are not people who believe in the indulgence of it, neither we believe in the detachment of it; but in the balance. That's why you all have to be married, you have to have a proper physical life and that you should have proper children and lead a very sensible, dignified married life. That is very important. But love should be there. There should be love between husband and wife, between children and parents and everyone. If one person goes into imbalance the whole family goes into imbalance. To establish a family, sweetly and nicely, is also an art. And if both of them agree and say that, “We will do this way!” I am sure it's not difficult. Because you are Sahaja Yogis [so] you already know the quality of balancing.

What I find in the West, now, is the balance has gone really on the rocks. Because, see now, there are all kinds of problems of homosexuality and this and that and all that. This is just because of imbalances [that] people have gone to that limit. Another is asceticism, where your people are ascetic, made ascetic like in TM and all that. They have taken to these things. Because these are unnatural things. Natural is to be in balance. If you are not in balance then things go off and you become either too much of something and nothing of the other. That’s how people suffer.

So from Ganesha’s chakra we have to learn what are we doing. So sometimes we have to accumulate things, we have to consume things, and then we have to throw them away also. It is not that what ever we consume is just stored up within us or in the house. So we must also learn how to throw away things and how to take inside. This is in our household [and] in our thought also. In our thought also, when we receive some thoughts from anywhere, we should only digest that [which] is good for us. And it’s digested because of Paramachaitanya. The rest should be thrown away, you shouldn't bother [with it]. Like yesterday somebody met me. She said, “Mother I am a Catholic and I cannot get out of Catholicism.” She is supposed to be, she wants to do, Sahaja Yoga. Then I said, “You stay inside Catholicism.” Because there is no question of balance. But in Sahaja Yoga whatever good of Catholicism, means that you have to worship Christ - that part is alright. The rest, whatever is nonsensical has to be thrown away.

So the whole atmosphere that you face, of thoughts, of ideas, of books, whatever you read, you must develop a capacity to consume that [which] is good for you, and whatever is bad you should throw away. I must say in Austria people are really doing that very well.

Somebody is now doing research on Koran. He is taking out all the essences of Koran which are in balance. Koran talks of balance: talks of that you must have balance - equilibrium. It talks of it, and so he has taken that point. And now he is taking out all that creates imbalances in the Islamic book called ‘Koran’, which people have used for imbalances. On one point you can show how they have gone, deviated, from their path. ‘Deviated’ means - they have gone into imbalances.

For example Christianity now: you can take it very clearly that they didn't use Ganesha's principle there at all. But all throughout it’s written that you have to look after yourself in a moral way. Now in the Old Testament it is written: 'Thou shalt not commit adultery’. But Christ has made it even subtler - very subtle - because He’s at Agnya controlling the eyes. So he said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.” But the Christians have crossed all the limits of adultery, all the limits. I mean, I don't know to what limit they are going to go now, I mean really they have gone amuck, the way they are going into this kind of experimentation. And then what will happen to your children? What will happen to your society?

That’s what is happening now, in complete imbalance. Completely in imbalance, all these societies, where they are using adultery as a style of life. What Christ has said, just the opposite they are doing.

Same as Shri Krishna has said that in everybody resides the Spirit. Then everybody is just the same. So how can you have caste system? You can have at the most caste system according to the work that you are doing. But you can't have caste system according to the birth. You cannot have. I mean it’s so plain, clean. You can see it so clearly, He has said it, that everybody has got the Spirit. So everybody can ascend. Christ has said the same thing. He has not said that women don't have the Spirit or men have the Spirit. And look at the way that these people are talking that they cannot have ordination. Of course ordination itself is humbug, but still. But to deprive someone of certain rights because they are women or men is something absolutely, I should say, nonsense. It has no relevance to dharma, because ‘dharma’ means balance. ‘Dharma’ means balance. The one who has balance is the man who is dharmic, who is in the centre.

If you are in the centre, say you take, say a balance, this called as balancing. But in Hindi it's called as taraju (तराजू). Now you hold it in the hand. It’s called as balance, can you imagine? You hold it in the centre. The centre of gravity of that balance is in the centre. Now if you go more on this side this will go down, or you go on this side it will go down. But if you are at the gravity point you cannot move this side or that side.

Can you imagine the gravity is coming from Mother Earth! And Mother Earth has made Shri Ganesha. So this gravity point within us is to be maintained and this gravity comes very natural to human beings. It’s not to be adopted or anything. If [in] childhood, if children are told about their gravity, about their dignity, about their greatness, they will immediately develop it with a great pride that, “We are something special and that we have to have this gravity within us.”

Now this gravity gives you a kind of an attraction. Anybody who is grave, doesn't mean that you pull a big face, it never means that. But gravity means that you are not disturbed easily by any turmoil or anything.

Gravity means so many things as you can see, from Shri Ganesha's character. Gravity means you are the one who is standing in the centre. A person who sees everything and doesn't get disturbed, doesn't get tempted, is self-contented, doesn't ask for anything, doesn't need anything, doesn't take revenge, forgives. Because he has no way to get out of his gravity. He is just bound there. Now somebody takes a revenge and runs away: “Alright, go away!” If somebody tries to trouble him: “Alright, go away!” Because he can't run out of that gravity point. That other person has lost his balance but he can't run after that person who is in imbalance. So he doesn't run after that person who has done wrong. He says, “Alright, he has done wrong? Have pity on him let him do that.” He doesn't run after that person. He is standing there. And his standing there itself is sufficient to frighten others, and to destroy others. Because he’s standing at a point where he cannot be destroyed. But the others are running towards destruction. So what's the use of running after him, getting yourself also destroyed?

Such a person who has achieved that balance sees others as something to be pitied, because he sees they are on the verge of falling down. I am here nicely settled down, but they are on the verge of falling down. They may try to tell him, they may try to help him. They may try to do everything for that person, because they can see that person is going to fall down. But if that person doesn't want to take to balance you cannot force it.

So the Ganesha's greatest quality is that he has gravity. With that gravity he sits down on this Mother Earth. Now, because this is a country of Ganesha, the Australians must have balance, should, naturally have. But they don’t. I must tell you, they don’t. And my experience of Australians before I started Sahaja Yoga has been terrific, I must tell you that (laughing)! If an Australian starts drinking, only person who can compete with him is a Russian! And then they talk so irrelevantly, you don't know how to deal with them. If they shake your hand, then you will feel, after some time, you have lost it. Everything they do in such a big way that I couldn't understand why is it [that] they shake your hand so badly. So C.P. said, “You see they have lots of jungles.” He tried to console me, “and there are lots of animals and things and that's why you see they shake hands like that.” I said, “No animal shakes hands you see!”  How have they learned from the animals? I can't get this explanation alright! On the contrary they are extremely gentle. Animals are extremely gentle with each other. So how this kind of shaking hands has started? And only people who can beat them are Greeks who shake hands in a very funny way that really you get a big jerk!

So I felt that the country of Ganesha, should be absolutely in balance and in one tune with this Paramachaitanya. You see the animals who live in the jungles. You have so much of nature. See these trees - they grow up to a point and they do not aggress others, they do not fight, they do not have groups. Nothing of the kind. Just they grow, accept whatever is given to them, live with it happily, and if they have to be destroyed they accept the destruction. But they are absolutely in contact with God, or under the complete control of God almighty. That's why animals are called as ‘pashu', means pash, means ‘under the control of God’. While we have got freedom. Even we have got freedom. Still this is the country of Shri Ganesha. [What] the nature should really imbibe within you, is the balance. And the balance should come in such a manner that your whole character, your own temperament should show that balance within you. But what I find is the most difficult thing in Australia that there are groups and people fight and lots of problems with that. It surprises me - how can [it be], in the country of Ganesha, where there are ganas? All Ganas are here. If ganas start fighting with each other what will happen? Supposing the anti-bodies in our body start fighting with each other then what will happen to our body?

So you are like ganas! You are specially blessed people to be born in this special country. And, after all these achievements that you have made, if you are going to take these absolutely nonsensical things of the countries which are over developed, have lost their balance, then what's the use of being born in this Ganesha's land?

In this Ganesha's land you have to have a complete balance within yourself. That’s what I expect from the Sahaja Yogis of Australia: that they have to give to the whole world the sense of balance of Shri Ganesha. On the contrary it is being reported to me that, every time we have our programme in Ganapatipule, people have noticed that there are groups in Australia, that people are not clean hearted; they talk ill of others. And they told me, warned me, “Mother be on the look out, why it is happening. They speak something behind their backs and try to convince the people of other countries about it.” Of course they being so clean that they don't like it. They don't want to hear it from Sahaja Yogis. They don't want to hear against anyone who are Sahaja Yogis. So they informed me, “Mother this is a very serious thing!” And certain things [that] they have told me are really very serious.

So now we have to first decide that we should bear no grudge to anyone. How can you bear a grudge to anyone? We have to be forgiving. All the time forgiving. Something, somebody has said it, alright, doesn't matter. As it is, English language, you know, is not a very soft language, it’s not a very soft language, and in that if you say something one should not mind. It's a very humorous language but the humour sometimes cuts you out. But it doesn't matter. That’s the defect of the language. But that doesn't mean that you should say harsh words to anyone, or you should be indifferent to anyone. Do your duties to your children, to your wife, to your husband.

Indifference to anyone, itself, is tremendous harshness. For the small thing if a woman gets angry and doesn't talk to her husband, or if the husband neglects the wife, and doesn't bother about her, looking after her, caring for her, then it's a crime. According to Sahaja Yoga it's a wrong thing to do. Because you must have balance you must have softness of nature. You should talk very softly to others and be kind and nice. Just find out if you are doing that or not. Then between the group [also]. It's a question of using the power of love. We have no other power: we have no money power, we have no this political power, economic power, nothing. What power we have got is the power of love. For that, when you talk to each other, one has to talk in a soft manner; extremely soft and kind manner.

You’ll be surprised: I must say, in my experience, I have found Germans like that! Extremely soft to each other, extremely gentle! I mean I can't believe these Germans who killed the whole world once upon a time! Now in Sahaja Yoga suddenly they have realise, “What a horrible thing we have done!” And Sahaja Yogis, they are extremely gentle. You scratch anyone and you will be surprised that the, all of them, all the Sahaja Yogis are extremely, extremely gentle.

While the Italians I used to think would be very gentle, because they have art, culture, everything and they produce such nice things. But on the contrary I find that Germans can beat them. It’s beautiful German Sahaja Yogis there have. They hate neo-fascism. They said, “We have had enough of it! We had such a bad name all over the world! If they know we are Germans nobody wants to look at us!” And what are these people doing? So they have become extremely gentle, from one end to another end. And this gentleness really brings them out, because everybody is so surprised that Germans could be that gentle, so sweet.

Now look at Shri Ganesh - how gentle he is, how sweet he is and how innocent he is. His ways are so gentle: how he works on you, how he makes things for you, how gently he does all these things. Like see now you cannot see this flower opening. In my room you put some flowers and they started growing. You can't see the growth. If you put a camera of a special nature which can record, you can see it growing there, but you can't see [normally]. You can't see a tree growing. You can't see a flower opening out. You just can't see anything that is growing by nature, by Shri Ganesh. He does it so gently. Now also he will not grow trees one on top of another! But in such a way that they all get the suns rays. Just like a great mother, I must say, the way, gently, he does everything. Every leaf is made differently - what an art! Every leaf! In the whole world you cannot find exactly the same leaf whether it is from Australia or from America. The leaf, if you see it under a microscope, will differ. Every leaf! Can you imagine? Look at his work, how gently he puts everything, how gently he works. And while we are living on the grounds of Shri Ganesha how gentle we should be. And in dealing with people we should be extremely, extremely gentle. We should show that we are Ganesha's special ganas. That's what I feel about Australians.

We have had some mishaps, I know, doesn't matter. But that's alright. A few of them were like that. But all of you should really learn to be very loving, gentle, kind and concerned. Small, small things can make people happy, very happy. And I try all these tricks myself and you should also try these tricks. It’s very simple. One day I gave a sari to a lady, so she said, “Mother how do you know I love this colour?” “Because I have seen you mostly wearing this colour. So I know you love this colour.” “But did you see me?” “Yes, of course, I saw you.” So these small things: she was so heartened; she felt that, “Mother notices me,” Because I have seen you. I mean I see all of you. But I know about all of you because I am concerned and bothered about you. And everyone I know where you stand, what's wrong with you, what should be done, what you like, what you don't like. There's no harm in doing that.

It’s much better to have a better rapport when you understand what's the problem is. I immediately know what's the problem. I know a person who is dominating, I know a person who is mistrusting. Everything I know. And gradually I try to tell them in a very gentle way that, “This should be corrected.” But you need not tell them. For you there's a very simple method of giving bandhans and improving people. You don't have to worry about doing something very drastic about it or to tell them on the face. Only thing if you give bandhan to them you can do it.

Now, about this, how to develop this balance, is the big problem and I was thinking that I will talk about this later on to people in details: how to develop the balance in our character, in our nature. Of course meditation does help you to be in the centre. But, still, sometimes we just slip off. And there is a way by which you can really make your character in such a way that you’ll remain in balance all the time. On the contrary when there will be a crisis you will just jump on to your gravity point. That should happen. If that happens no problem. It happens with me. If I see any crisis anywhere, in Sahaja Yoga, in my family life, or anywhere, immediately I know that I am deep down on to my gravity. And from there I can see everything so clearly and then I solve the problem.

That is what one has to understand, that you have to jump on your gravity. And then it's not a relative position. To be on the gravity is not a relative position. It is not that you have to compare yourself with others. No you don't have to. You don't have to think that I'll be losing this or I'll be gaining this. Nothing of the kind. You are there on your own position. You are there. You are in charge of yourself.

So you don't worry. There is no jealousy, there's no fear, there's no kind of a temptation, just you are there. You are not bothered.

Sometimes I have seen the leaders are worried about their leadership sometimes. Now leadership is just hocus-pocus, I must tell you. If somebody says Mother you become the leader I’ll say, “No. I know. I know that joke!” So it’s a joke. Leadership is a joke you see. And if you know it’s a joke, then only you will work it out better. Because, there's nothing like hierarchy in Sahaja Yoga. As you know, we are all one, the same. We cannot say that hands are better than feet and the feet is better than this - nothing of the kind.

In the same way everything is very important, and everything circulates like the blood cells. So we do not say that this blood cell is good and that blood cell is bad. Or this blood cell is higher, that blood cell is higher. In the same way everybody is circulating. So one should not have any fear. Also fear of the leader should not be there. There’s no need to fear the leader. If you are on your gravity you keep to it. He will understand you. As long as leader is on the gravity he’ll be there, as soon as he goes away from the gravity he'll go away himself.

So you stand on your own gravity point and nobody can disturb you. You should have no fear, nothing. Nothing to bother in Sahaja Yoga. As it is you are all saints. What is there to bother? The whole ganas, all the angels, all this All-pervading Power is looking after you.

Yesterday we saw a kind of a light, miraculous light, following us on both the sides of the car. Especially on my side there was such a lot of light following. Just giving [an] indication that it’s alright, this is Ganesha's place and here things are going to work out.

So you are placed so well, you have so many powers within yourself and which you can express very well. Fearlessly you can have it within yourself. Anybody who tries to trouble you will be looked after by this All-pervading Power, you don't have to do anything about it.

So try to see: are you in balance in any way. Some people are too much attached to their family and some people are detached. Too much attachment to family is also wrong. What is the need to be attached so much? You’ll spoil your children. When they grow up they hit you back. So best is to keep them in balance, have a detached attitude towards life. And this detached attitude, as I had told you, is like the sap in the tree which goes to all the places. If it is surplus it can evaporate or it can go down, but it doesn't stick to anything, because if it sticks to anything, that involvement will kill that tree and also kill that part, that flower, where it is sticking on to. So we see that attached love is the death of the love. So we have to have a proper understanding of this detached love, where you stand on your gravity and you have concern about everyone, you think about everyone. In case you find that somebody is not alright, you don't lose your balance, but get that person in the balance.

If you start losing your balance then how can you get back that person. And in that way you will lose all your hatred, all your anger, all your lust, or what you can call, all your competition, all that. Because you stand in your own dignity. You don't want [a] certificate from anyone. You don't want any praising from anyone. You just know that you are there. And you are self-contented.

Then it's not also necessary that, “Mother must give me a special audience!” It's all ego. “I must see Mother! I have to see her privately!” What is the need to see me privately? I am never private I am available every time to you, all the time. So all these things are coming out of the ignorance and out of the fact that you are not on your gravity point.

So today, to begin with, we have this Ganesh puja where we all should, in our heart, think what is our gravity point and [on] that we have to stand very firm.

May God bless you.
