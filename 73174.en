Talk and Workshop, Finchley Ashram, London 1st November 1978.

Doesn't matter. I said, I didn't have to knock. But I can assure you, this woman is not going to [UNCLEAR]. She said, I have to die with him. He said, how do you know? I said, that you don't die. That she is going to die with him, this thing. She'll be all right, she'll be walking about, to prove it to you. That there is a, she was all right, she started walking about and all that. But they said, how can you say that she's going to die? She's perfectly all right, her heart is beating all right. He said, how can you say such an inauspicious thing, Mataji? I said, it's not auspicious, it's a fact. He is not going to live very long. [UNCLEAR which has to act] And she died. So, that day, instead of understanding all this, he said, you know, Mataji said that she's going to die and she didn't die. I'm telling you how the cunning works.

Yogi: Yes, Mother, I think...

Shri Mataji: But you try. Let us see now. You try, because, you see, as soon as you decide it, all the satanic forces will start acting against you.

Yogi: Well, I'm not worried about it, the success/failure I mean, I just do the job.

Shri Mataji: Yes, you just try, but think about it in your meditation, what kind of a situation you should get. It's such a funny thing, I tell you. There was a doctor, Dr. [UNCLEAR Vartak], in Pune. It's very interesting how the satanic works. It's worth noticing. This Dr. [UNCLEAR Vartak] came to Sahaja Yoga very much. He came to Sahaja Yoga just like, I mean, he would say that one, like a fish, takes to water. And he started working with it, curing people and this and that. Within two years' time, he cured 500 people of his rheumatism. Five hundred people. And then he wanted to have a public [UNCLEAR interest in it]. That time I was in America, I didn't know. And he gave a big public interest. I mean, it was all published in newspapers. Times, Maharashtra Times published. Five hundred things he said. And he's given this diabetes, I've cured, I've done this, I've done this. And also he gave about Sahaja Yoga. It's true, Sahaja Yoga, Mataji is the exponent and all that he did. As soon as he appeared on the paper, all the satanic forces.

Can you imagine the same thing turned against Sahaja Yoga? After some time and what did he start doing? Separate his body from him and get into drugs. And now he's in a lunatic asylum, but that's all right. So ultimately people will think, what, Mataji's this [UNCLEAR Vartak] is ending up in the lunatic asylum? Only the Sahaja Yogis can see the [UNCLEAR cure]. Not only, but he finished our Pune center like that, which is a negativity. I think it's a divide, no doubt, it is a divide but he finished. It was in the paper, five hundred cases he showed. And the one who did was Rajvara, he's still our disciple. And he being a doctor, this was published.

Gregoire: And it went to his head or what was his mistake?

Shri Mataji: His mistake was, you see, it went into his head [UNCLEAR to party] to his head. Apart from that, everybody started interviewing him and all that. And the negative came to his head. And he joined another sort of, another, should say our enemy. That's so unpredicted. [UNCLEAR]. He was saying, my body is becoming, you see, aware of itself. I'm getting out of my body, I'm doing this, I'm doing that.

All right. I mean, I'm just telling you that Sahaja Yoga, that's why, is to be seen. Only the Sahaja Yogis can understand the play of it. Unless and until you are realised, you cannot understand its depth.

Gregoire: Mother, then isn't it still the best way, is from friend to friend and from...

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, you try every way. If it fails, what does it matter to us?

Gavin: The whole point is to remember that whatever we're doing, it's to spread Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Yes, it spreads this way and that way.

Gavin: But not to worry about whether it's accepted or not.

Shri Mataji: We should not worry about the success part. That's again I'm telling you. Do not decide by the success. You see, success you shall, don't have to worry. Success part is, what was the success of Christ's life when He lived? Crucifixion. This was the remark of the whole world view.

Yogi: This is the difficult thing, is to forget success. I mean, I must confess.

Shri Mataji: Yes, but that is the trouble, is the supraconscious. If I think of the success, say, why your book was denied? Because they thought there was no commercial. If they had not thought of success, they would have got it.

See, I'm working on him. Maybe I may give realisation, may not. Maybe he may be nice to me, maybe he may say something wrong, or maybe that he may destroy Sahaja Yoga by being here. Possibly, anything is possible. People have done like that. But my job is to give him, whether he accepts it, whether he gets it, whether he's useful or not. I mean, I have broken my neck like that many times, you have seen, or thousands of people. How many of them have come to reality, very few. But your job is to work. You have seen your Mother doing that. I'm not bothered about it.

You have seen him, [UNCLEAR] working day in and day out. You have seen it. Thousands of them come to us, and in India also. How many of them are in India? I go out of the way to work on them. Out of the way. How much works out?

Yogi: This is inhuman.

Gavin: The job is to work, not to work out.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, that's it. If you understand this point, this you must learn from Me. You have seen me working. And so many times people get even angry with Me. They, Mother, what is this? On everyone you are breaking your hands and feet and this and that. And what is the thing? What is the thing? What are they doing? Even a person like [UNCLEAR] says, that what do you mean by this distributing like this to all of them? He says that it is like, what Christ has said is to cast the pearls before the something, yeah, like that. So they do not like it. They say, why are you doing it for everyone of you? Why do you want to try? But this is the real karma. The one who is just doing the karma. I don't know if Sahaja Yoga will be successful or not, I am not done.

Yogi: But that's the only way, indeed, that you can become a colony, isn't it?

Shri Mataji: Yes. akarma is that way. It's flowing. It's working. Everything is in akarma except for human beings. Yeah, If you see the sun, it will not bother. It shines.It works out. If it works out, [UNCLEAR]. And then, aum sakshat suraÌ„yini, the giver of success. So simple to understand.

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: You see, if the success, what you think is success is given to you, you will not give up your rationality.

Yogi: You will not give up your [UNCLEAR] because...

Shri Mataji: You will not give up your rationality to begin with because your rationality gives you the idea of success. And if you get according to your rationality your success, then that's very dangerous. It goes to your head. It doesn't go to your heart. But if you get failures also, then you become like Ronny. One both the ways is wrong. To be seen only, to do, that's all. Just to do. Works out when I do, doesn't work out. Everything is [UNCLEAR]. You are just to act.

Better now. [UNCLEAR] Nabhi is very weak?

Yogi: He used to drink quite a lot but he is trying now.

Shri Mataji: But he went to a psychiatrist.

Yogi: I am a psychiatrist.

Shri Mataji: Ah. [laughter]

Gavin: Consciously, yes.

Shri Mataji: He used to study psychiatry. Now.

Yogi: [UNCLEAR] very much, yes in fact it is gone completely cool.

[laughter]

Shri Mataji: So the success part, you become the agent of that. Because the agents are not there of the success, okay? Your Mother can dance just like this, if you know how to handle her. She can use all her capacity, if you know how to handle her. Left has cooled down completely. Now, what do you want to do?

Yogi: I don't know, I feel quite warm there.

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Yogi: Right.

Shri Mataji: Now. Are you feeling any joy within you? His heart made into a stone! Now, what's your heart? I mean, it has gone to such a limit with people, in the so-called modern advanced society, that they think to enjoy itself [UNCLEAR]. It is really so much destroying. What's his name? Racks? What's his name?

Yogi: Jackie, he calls himself.

Shri Mataji: Jackie.

Yogi: Jack.

Shri Mataji: Jack. Ah, it's still melting.
