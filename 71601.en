[Shri Mataji's takk starts at 24:35]

I bow to all the Seekers of truth. The truth is that we cannot [problems in the mike] that you cannot change it. You cannot transform it and you cannot conceptualize it. Also, at this human awareness, you cannot know it. In the evolutionary process, we have come to this stage as human beings. But as we see the problems of the world, we realize that most of the problems are coming from human beings. And all these problems, if you analyse them, come from the problems of these centres which are within us, because these centres cater to your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual being.Of course, in the medical science, it is not mentioned. But we have plexuses, and all these plexuses that we know of, on a physical level, are acted upon by these centres. But as you know, we believe in all specialization. So, these days, they say that if you have to have a doctor for this eye, you go to one doctor. And for the another eye, to another doctor. But this is the science of totality, of the whole, where you have to trigger an energy which is lying in the sacrum bone. Just imagine! It was called sacrum by the Greeks, meaning they knew it's a sacred bone. Or why did they call it a sacred bone? This energy to pass through all these centres to integrate them to nourish them and to enlighten them, and ultimately to break through your fontanel bone area which we call as ‘talu’ to connect it to the All-pervading Power of Param Chaitanya. It is described as Ruha in Quran, it’s described as All-pervading Power of divine love, in Torah. Also, it is described inthe Bible as the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, whatever you may call it.

The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego. Because you say, "This is my ego, my conditioning, my body". So, 'my' stands for which 'I'? To whom does it belong? There must be someone. Now who runs your heart? If you ask a doctor, he’ll say ‘autonomous nervous system’. But who is the auto?So, the first truth is that you are the pure Spirit, first. And the second truth is that there is an All-pervading Power of divine love, which does all the living work. We see these beautiful flowers, it's a miracle by itself! If you see this human body- doctors must be knowing- many questions we cannot answer. For example, any foreign body which enters into the body is thrown away, it is the nature's law. But when it's the foetus, it is kept there till 9 months nicely looked after, nourished, and then at the right time, it is thrown away. How? There are many other things which I can talk to doctors, but at this moment, we have to understand that science is all right, but it cannot answer all the questions. First of all, it is amoral. Science is amoral and the second thing is that it cannot answer many questions. One of them is why are we on this Earth? I'm sorry, we are having very marathon programs. [Shri Mataji is coughing]

So, then we turn to religion, where is the answer? And then we see the chaos of the religion. In the name of God, what people are doing here? We can't understand these people who are in charge of religion, how can they be so corrupt, so money oriented? And absolutely without any morals. Any religion, it's no question of one religion or another religion. So, what we find basically, that all these religions are either they are power oriented or they are money oriented or both.
