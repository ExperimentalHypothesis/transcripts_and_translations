Put our steering on one side, God knows where we would have arrived! So when you start the kundalini, you know where to stop it, what to do it, how to raise it, what is the problem, at what center you have to do what. All right? So this is a thing you should see for yourself.  Not just to follow something, stand on your head, do this exercise. You can land up with great difficulties, into great problems. We have seen people getting terrible problems with this Hatha yoga also, because they are just doing it without understanding anything. That's why I say that you must have the knowledge of the roots first.

Now, any other question, please?

You can't even think. That's what has happened to some of you. Don't worry; that happens. Why it happens, I'll tell you later on but it happens; you just can't think - gone beyond thinking. When the kundalini rises above this center Ã¢â‚¬' this is the center of Christ you can't think. You just can't think. Even if you want to, you're just beyond thinking. And then when it breaks through, you see, then you just start feeling it in the hands also. And then the power of your own spirit manifests. It's not my power or anybody's power; it's your own. You must feel your own power and not somebody else's power. 

It's really fantastic, that's what you are feeling.  It is because you are fantastic; you don't know what you are. Like a television set, you take to a villager and you say, "Now, just wait and you'll see all kinds of plays here and you'll hear all kinds of things," and they'll say, "Are you mad?  This box, how can it do it?" You just put on the switch, and it works out because all built in there. You are that fantastic. Only the switch has to be put on.

We can't believe ourselves, you see, because we really don't know how great we are.  Actually, in Sahaja Yoga you are not allowed to feel guilty at all. Anyone of you are feeling guilty, please say in your hearts ten times that, "I am not guilty, I am not guilty, I am not guilty." You are not to degrade yourself at all because here you have come to know that you are the temple of God. No, it doesn't mean that you know only through this but actually it happens to you. All right? Should we have the experience?

Any questions now left? Let's start.  We'll try. Now it's very simple. What you have to do is to take out your shoes as you have very kindly taken it out. Now, why? Because the Mother Earth helps us, you see. We have to take help from the Mother Earth.

Put both the feet on the ground just like that, like that, not very close but little, little further like that and both the hands like this, spread out but on your lap and be comfortable. You have to be comfortable but don't put them like this or don't put them like that; just put them straight like this, just like this. And please take out your spectacles because it will help your eyesight also. Now just now don't worry about anything. Everything is fine. 

Now put your attention into complete freedom, in the sense don't try to hold it or put it in one place or pierce it through another. Just leave it alone. You see, some people have the habit of putting the attention to this and that - nothing.  You just put both the hands on your lap, comfortably spreading the fingers like this.  Open out, not like that. Open out and just close your eyes. Please don't open your eyes till I tell you, because when kundalini rises, when she pierces through this Agnya chakra, as I told you that of Christ, the dilatation of the pupils takes place and if your eyes are not closed, it may not rise. So better keep it closed till I tell you. Just keep it closed. Just put both the hands clearly like this.

Once this happens to you, you can enlighten another person because you get the power to enlighten other people. You can cure other people. You can give them realization. But first, you must become capable. There is nothing to be afraid of.  Keep your eyes shut completely.

As I told you before, you have to say in your heart that, "Mother, I am not guilty." That's very important to begin with. Now at this juncture, you have to say in your heart, sincerely that, "Mother, I forgive everyone." You must forgive everyone. That's very important because when you say that it is difficult, you must know that by not forgiving, you are playing into the hands of the people who have troubled you. You must learn. You must say, "Mother, I forgive everyone." Is very important.  Forgiveness is the greatest weapon we have got, but say it sincerely from your heart that, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

Now as I said that you are the spirit. You are the spirit and you have to become that means your attention must be enlightened by the spirit. So you may ask a question, putting your right hand on your heart, where the spirit resides, on your heart. You ask a question, "Mother, am I the spirit?" You are, I'd say. You are. But you may ask a question if you are not confident about it.

Now the spirit within us is our Master. He is our Guru. He is the one who guides us. When the spirit starts shining in our attention, we become collectively conscious. By that our awareness becomes enlightened and the spirit in our heart guides us. So we can put down this hand on the stomach, on the left hand side, on the stomach and we can ask another question, "Mother, am I my own master?", "Am I my own guru?" You have to ask ten times. Which you are, you are your master if you become the spirit and the spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within us. It's a collective being within us.

Now you can put back the same hand again on the heart, left hand on the heart, and very confidently you please say twelve times, "Mother, I am the spirit," ten times. Now you put the right hand across on your neck on the left hand side again. As the spirit cannot commit any mistakes or cannot be guilty, say sixteen times positively that, "Mother, I am not guilty." Put the hand on the left hand side.  There's a center there which gets out of order, left hand side on the neck where, when you feel guilty, this center goes out of order. So you have to just say, "Mother, I am not guilty." On the base of the neck, just base of the neck, just press it hard.  You'll find it's quite hard for all of you because it's a fashion to feel guilty these days. What are you feeling guilty about? You see, here I am talking to you about God who is the ocean of love, who is the ocean of compassion and of forgiveness.  What mistakes can we commit in His presence or against Him that He cannot forgive us? Sixteen times, please say. 

Now put the right hand across your forehead, just across your forehead.  Now here on your forehead, please.  Put it on your forehead and you have to just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone." This you have to say very sincerely. Only twice if you say it will work out. Just say twice, "Mother, I forgive everyone." Just say that and it will work out. Just say that. Better. Much better now.

Now put this hand on top of your head, specially the palm touching the area which we call the fontanel bone area or the soft bone you had in childhood and just rub it softly in a clockwise manner. Just move it, your head in a clockwise manner, little bit. Now at this point I cannot cross your freedom. You have to say, "Mother, I want my Self-realization." You have to say it.  If you don't ask for it, I cannot force it on you. You have to say, "Mother, I want my realization. Please give me realization."  Whichever way you want to say, you can say that and then it will work out.  You have to say it seven times. Why numbers, I'll tell you later on but just say seven times, "Please give me my realization, Mother," or, "I want my realization, Mother. Definitely, I want it."

Now you just see if you are feeling any heat or cool breeze coming out of your head there; just see. If this hand is tired, you can use the other hand, putting right hand towards Me.  Just lift your hand a little, about four inches higher than your head, four inches higher. See if there is a cool breeze coming. Move another hand. Whichever hand you try, put one hand towards Me. Don't open your eyes. See now if you are feeling. Little bit higher. You have to have it about four inches higher, not very high, about four inches higher.

Are you? Good, good.  Everybody will feel it but be patient with yourself.  Not so high, just about four inches across the head like that. Just try like that,  I think.  You can change your hand if you want, if you are tired, but if you are getting in your head, on your head, I mean out of your head, I should say, then you can put your hands towards Me.

Don't be serious; there is nothing to be serious. It's just, now put both the hands towards Me when you feel there is a cool breeze coming out. Now it has to come out of you, in your hands also. This is the first time you feel this All-pervading Power, about which people have told, for the first time.  You can ask a question. Ask a question, "Mother,  is this the power of the Holy Ghost?" or "Is this the All-pervading Power of God?"

In Sanskrit language, this power is called as Brahma Shakti. First thing it will happen will be that you will find there is no thought in your mind. Secondly, you'll feel extremely relaxed. Keep your eyes shut and don't think. If you are not sure, then there are Sahaja yogis who can help you. Those who are not sure can raise their hands and the Sahaja yogis can help them, if you are not sure. That's it; just help him. Yes, just help him. You got it? Good. Great.

[Shri Mataji asks individuals whether they felt the cool breeze and she asks the senior  Sahaja yogis to help the newcomers with their respective Kundalini status.]

Yeah, it's great. Just enjoy.  Are you all right now? Good.

Who else is not feeling it? There, can you come this side? Anyone up there who is not feeling it?  You can come on the sides, you see. It's better to come on the sides. He's got it!  You've got it, my child. You've got it.

What about you? Daniel, just try this lady.  Jyothi, you try, try this lady.  She's got it. Great. What about this gentleman? Just got. Little Kingsley, can you see this gentleman? What did he say? Has he got it? What about this one? No?  No, raise it. It's left to the right. Put him left to the right. He'll be all right. All right? Not so sure?  He is not sure but what about you? Ask him to put his hand on his liver, this gentleman. Put him left to the right.  Are you feeling it now?

All right, open your eyes.  Watch Me without thinking.  Let's see. Just watch me without thinking.  Put him left to the right. Anne, just try this lady. Has she got it?  She has got it. Let her put her hand on the head. Hot, hot still.  Left hand, left hand would be better. Left to the right. Now is he? Better, little less raise it I think, raising will help.  Raise his kundalini. Tell them how to raise it also, those who have come.  She felt it? No? What's she saying? She felt it.  These both have got it. It should work out. Put her right to the left. Pedro, put her right to the left. [Unclear. From seeker] In the head?  What about you? Can you release your neck a little bit? [Unclear from seeker] warm, all right. Doesn't matter. Left to the right you put it.  What about him?  Both! This one gentleman. Gavin, just see this gentleman, this one, this one here, this one.  All right? Vishuddhi, Vishuddhi is there.  You put your bandhan there on the Vishuddhi.  Better now? Are you?  Good, good. It will work out.  That's Pedro from very far off who has come to help you here, isn't it. All right? She is good. She is good.

What about the lady who asked about the sufferings?  She got it? Where is she? Has she got realization? Did she get realization? Nick, that's the one.  She felt it in the hands?

[Comment from Yogi: "Earlier on she felt it. She felt it earlier on, just not on her hands"]  

Shri Mataji: Mm, she's got it. Neck! Put your hand, I think. [Unclear] Just the neck.  Just put your hand. There's a problem on your neck.  Have you been smoking or something?  What about you? She is, she has felt it. What's the problem? It should be only Vishuddhi. Simple Vishuddhi is there. Just put your hand. You see, these days it has been raining so that everybody got this trouble in the throat, I tell you. That's why they are not feeling it. You all have cold, isn't it? Throat trouble.  In Sahaja Yoga you have to wear an undershirt always, all right? Now, now better? Better. Gavin, let him feel it on his head, at least first of all.  It is flowing quite a lot.  

Hello, Olympia. Come, come, come.

Olympia: I've got a biscuit.

Shri Mataji:  Ah, now you eat it.  I don't eat biscuits. I just eat [unclear] all right? See now they'll take your photograph. Now you are eating a biscuit it will show in the photograph. A big thing showing from here your biscuit now in the photograph.  Nice place.  Like it?

[Yogini, Carol] What can we give them to take away?  Can we give them a photograph of you? The people here tonight.

Those who have felt the cool breeze can give them.  The things that you have painted is all right.  But those who have felt.  But those who haven't felt don't give them, all right? [Unclear]  You've done this! [unclear]  Very good.

Where is your mother?  She hasn't come. Why? Father?

Carol: They've got people staying. Explains why her parents can't come.

It's all right.  But they like this boy very much, did they?  [unclear]

Carol:  They're delighted.  They're so happy. 

Shri Mataji: All right. That's all I wanted to find out. May God bless you.  I'm very happy.

Carol:  We're getting married in church on the eleventh of June at 3pm.

Shri Mataji:  I won't be there. I'm sorry.  May God bless you. 

This is Carol.  She is getting married. She's getting married to someone.  He's there, you see.  His name is - I've forgotten his name.  He's from Portugal.  Petro, yes.  You know everybody's name, Petro

Olympia: What's that?

Shri Mataji:  It's water. You want it?  Want more?  Want more? Come along. Have it.  All right?

Olympia: Thank you, Mother.

Shri Mataji:  Thank you, Olympia, for giving me this.  This one also, thank you, thank you. Bye. 

All their fingers catching, is it?  They are catching on all these fingers?  Now what is it? Is he all right?  No.  He's a great seeker.  You must give him.  He's feeling? Feet?  The hands are because of the Vishuddhi.  What's the problem with the Vishuddhi? He has some problem?   Feet, he is feeling! Yes, I think so. What about you?  Are you feeling anything?  Madam, are you?  A cool breeze?

New Yogini:  I have a lot of pain in my neck.  

Shri Mataji: You have a problem on your spine?  

New Yogini:  Not that I know.  

Yogini:  She has a pain in her neck.  

Shri Mataji:  You do get.  Can you come here?  Can you sit before me?  Spread your legs.  Just sit down facing that side.  All right, sit down on the ground facing that side.  I mean, spread your legs that way. Just sit comfortably, all right? You are sitting with your Mother; so don't have any formality.  Can you take out this one for me? What's it? I'll have to fix it up, I think; his also. Is he feeling?  Agyna.  Turn him. Ask him to watch me.  There's Agyna.  

What's she say?

Yogini: She says, "I must come to Mother."

Shri Mataji: Now she's all right, isn't she?

Ah! What's it? Better?  Better now?  In this country, must always have something, you see, around your neck.  It's a funny weather here.  It just pierces through your bones and hurts you there.  See now, here it is.  It's so strong; it's the obstruction.  Still not there? Now where is it?  Here you get the pain? 

New Yogini:  I felt as if perhaps I was going to have the mumps.

Shri Mataji:  Now will you please say that, "Mother, I am not guilty."  Just say that. [Shri Mataji gets the Yogini to say the affirmation seven times.] All right?  Better now?  That's it.  That's the pain you have, of feeling guilty for nothing at all, that's all artificial.  It's better.  Better now.  Much better?  All right. Now can you leave your neck a little loose, absolutely loose, you see, into my hands?  Just leave it loose.  No, it's not loose at all. Just leave it. Not loose at all. Just leave it loose. No, no it's not loose. I have to break it a little.  It doesn't matter now.  I have done it now.  It's better now?  All right?

What about him?  Are you all right?  Good.  Got it.  This lady?  Good.  Very good.  What about the lady who asked me a question?  She got it?  You got it?  Did you feel the cool breeze? Did you? You felt it?

New Yogini: Don't know but how [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: No, that's different but did you feel it or not?  If you felt, unless and until you use it how will you know? But did you feel it?

New Yogini:  I think it's there.

Shri Mataji:  Sure? I am not very sure.  I am not really sure that you felt it.  Did you feel it or not, is the point.  Not the cool breeze.  She's catching on the Sahasrara.  She's still catching on the Sahasrara.  They are giving bandhans.  Better now, madam. Vibrated, isn't it? Better now. Feeling better. I'll put it right. You are better now, much better.  Little bit.  She is much better now, left Vishuddhi is much - are you better now?

New Yogini:  Yes, thank you.

Shri Mataji:  Now you turn your neck.  Let's see how far you can go.  Good.  Not paining now?  At all? That's good. Now may God bless you.  It's your own. Why are you thanking Me?  For what?  May God bless you.  Be careful.  I think you should put this.  That's a cross?

Yogini:  It's an Om.

Shri Mataji:  Om.  Better put it in the water for some time.  All right?

Yogini:  Really?

Shri Mataji:  Is important. Then I'll tell you what is to be done.  Just put it in the water for seven days.

Yogini:  I feel really hot; got a headache.

Shri Mataji:  Got a headache. Don't think about it, all right?  Just don't think.  Now just ask the question, "Mother, are you in my head?" Ask the question seven times.  Better?

Yogini:  A bit.

Shri Mataji:  Just say that again that, "Mother, you are in my head." Ask me the question seven times. Ah, released?  It's feeling in the hand also you are. You are feeling in the hands, aren't you?  Yes, it's there, right! You're released!  You shouldn't doubt you will get a headache. You were doubting?  What is there to doubt? I am not wanting anything.  I have come to give you something all right. You shouldn't doubt.  If you doubt you will get a headache.  Ah, better?  Finished!  Done.  You are there.  Now try to think. Let's think.  You're lost. That's it, all right?  Now don't doubt [unclear]. It might create little problem. May God bless you.

Now what's the matter, Simon?  Left heart.

Simon:  No, center heart, Mother.

Shri Mataji:  Just come here for one minute. Now you turn round.  Sit down with your feet straight. Can I see?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.  All right? May God bless you.  Good, now who else is not getting?

All right, come along.  Center heart? Vishuddhi.  All right come along, come along, come here.  Now relax. Sit down.  Take out your coat, if you don't mind.  Can you take out?  Yes, please, if you don't mind. Sit down facing that side.  All right, be comfortable. Don't worry.  Push your neck now. Hold your breath. Hold your breath please.  Now leave it. Hold your breath.  Leave it.  Again hold your breath. Now leave it.  Now in Sahaja Yoga you have to wear an undershirt all right, always.  Better now.  Now try to again hold your breath [unclear] like that.  Now leave it, much better.  Very bad center heart, very bad left Vishuddhi.  Now don't feel guilty.  Just don't feel guilty.  How are you feeling now?  Better?

Is she all right?
