Public Program – Day 2, Bangkok Thailand, 06-11-1990

[Introduction by a Sahaja Yogi until min. 04:40]

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

As I told you yesterday that truth is what it is. You cannot conceptualize it and you cannot also feel it with your human awareness. You have to become the Spirit - the subtler being. This is the knowledge of the roots. And if you have to know the roots you have to become a subtler being.

All the civilization has grown outside as a big tree but we should find out our roots otherwise all this civilization will be destroyed because we have lost our balance completely. In Russia people believe that democratic countries have all roads paved with gold but they do not know how demonic these democracies have become - such a lot of violence, so many diseases and so many people absolutely sick. So it is high time for us to have an introspection and also to get out of this relative world of different ideologies we have to find out the absolute.

So the only way, as it is suggested by all the religions and all the saints, is to get your Self-realisation. As all this is been explained to you now, you know there is within our understanding and reality this instrument is hidden and this is built within us during our evolutionary process. We have become human beings with a purpose and the purpose of our life is to be the Spirit.

He has already explained to you the medical side of Sahaja Yoga. By Sahaja Yoga many have been cured by psychosomatic diseases like cancer. All kinds of muscular diseases, all kinds of incurable diseases Sahaja Yoga has been able to cure in many cases. Also many diseases - like mental diseases, have been cured by Sahaja Yoga. It is your own energy, it is your own being that works it out. Within you this energy is residing. There are three doctors in India who have got now the MD. In Sahaja Yoga they have shown how epilepsy and asthma and cancer can be cured. If you were doctors I would have explained to you in medical terminology how it works. But in Russia there are 600 doctors who are practising Sahaja Yoga now and 200 scientists who are doing Sahaja Yoga.

So it is important for a lot of you, all of you to know that the time has come for us to get this higher state of awareness. But the nature of this kundalini is that she is your mother; she is your individual spiritual mother. She is the reflection of the Primordial Mother. She is the one who is awaiting to give you your second birth. She is the power of pure desire. All our other desires are not pure. Today we want to buy a house then we want to buy a car, then we want to buy an aeroplane: like that we are jumping from one desire to another. That's why economics is saying that wants are not satiable in general because the power of pure desire is Kundalini.

Whether you know it or not the desire which is pure within you is to be one with the divine Power. Unless and until you become one with that all-pervading divine Power you are never going to be satisfied. You'll always feel the emptiness within you. Now the nature of the Spirit is that it is a reflection of God Almighty within us in our heart.

[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Why don't you sit down please, don't disturb everyone. Please be seated, don't disturb.]

So the Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty in our heart but the seat on the Spirit is in the fontanel bone area - here - which was a taalu in your childhood. So now the meeting of the kundalini with the seat of the Spirit is the yoga. Yoga also has another meaning; means the trick - "yukti"; it's called as "yukti" - means the "trick" on this technique to know. So first you have to achieve your Self-realisation and then you have to know the technique how to give realisation to others. Every one of you is capable of getting Self-realisation.

As I told you the other day that I've given thousands of lectures only in English language, apart from other languages. So in this short time I may not be able to explain to you every aspect of Sahaja Yoga but you can achieve your Self-realisation and then you have to come to a follow-on program to know the technique and to grow. Of course, you don't have to pay for anything but you have to give some time to yourself. Unless and until you feel your depth the seed of doubtless awareness won't be sprouted.

So first you get the state of Nirvichara, Nirvichara samadhi meaning "thoughtless awareness" and the second state is doubtless awareness when then you can give realisation to others, you can cure others, you become extremely dynamic and very compassionate; and then your awareness becomes collective - that you can feel the centers of other people and your own centers. You have to just correct yourself and then you have to correct others. Actually you become your own master, you become your own guru.

But I have to tell you that this is a collective happening. You cannot say, "I am doing this in my house and still it doesn't work out." but you have to be in the collective. Like a nail is cut out then the body doesn't bother about it. It's a collective thing, means the whole body is collective and if one nail is cut out from the main then the body doesn't bother about the nail which is gone out. I mean to say that the body will grow but the nail won't grow. I wish you could come to India and see them - people from 56 nations come together. There is no quarrel, there is no fighting, there is no jealousy. It's such a purity, very pure relationships. And the enjoyment is so great. Only after realisation you can enjoy another person.

So I have to tell you that you should just desire that you should get your Self-realisation. Of course, if you have any questions you may ask me and then we'll have for about ten minutes again the session of realisation.

Yes, please.

Question: How does it feel when we reach Self-realisation? How we know we have reached it?

Shri Mataji: When you get your Self-realisation then you feel the cool breeze of this all-pervading Power, like a cool breeze, not very cool but very soothing and a breeze like this starts flowing which we called as paramchaitanya. So you start feeling it for the first time. It's described by Adi Shankaracharya as "salilaam, salilaam" - means the "cool and cool and cool", it soothes you down. Also you feel the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area when the Brahmarandhra - it's the last chakra, it's the limbic area, it's like that - and it opens out and when this opens out then you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head. In the beginning maybe little hot, maybe, little hot you might feel because sometimes if you have a liver problem or if you have not forgiven people you do feel that. But actually it works out ultimately. This is the feeling. Also your eyes get a glint of a shine, in the eyes; eyes become little different than normal - there is a glint in the eyes that shines. And you feel extremely peaceful; you feel the whole thing is like a drama when so many things happen one after another. And so many miracles takes place, I should say, everything, you feel its tailor-made made for you.

Like they wanted to write a book on the Sahaja Yoga miracles and the gentleman who was writing it said, "Mother, I don't know, within one's month time I have a pile here and a pile there. I don't know what to do, how to select." So all the time you feel this, the guiding hand of God's love is there and He is helping us out in everything.

Question: Can we sit down and raise our kundalini or is there some special technique?

Shri Mataji: I must say somehow I've developed this Sahaja Yoga in such a manner that in a very comfortable way you can get realisation. You don't have to worry. Formerly they had to go to Himalayas and do all kinds of things. It is made very easy now; somehow it works sitting down- whether you sit on the ground, you sit on the chair. Sometimes I found that people, if they are sitting higher than me could not get. But even that is now worked out. Whatever may be the position in which you are kundalini will rise. It is made so easy that people don't believe that it's possible. But we must know this the age of jets and as the growth is outside so fast we have to have the inner growth also fast.

Question: What is the procedure to get Self-realisation? Is much time needed?

Shri Mataji: That we are going to do now; we'll just work it out. That's very good question. No, it's not much time is needed. Actually, you have to come to the collective and they'll tell you morning about 5 minutes and evening about 10 minutes if you can sit down for meditation, they will tell you how to do it. Actually when you get into the meditation, you don't have to do it. You are all the time in meditation. So you don't have to spend much time for it. But you must meet; you must learn about it, how to fix it up. Because first the connections are loose, we can say, of the human beings with the Divine. Like this connection could be loose so we have to see that it's fixed properly. Once it is fixed there is no problem. So that's what you have to look after.

But after all, these days we are trying to save time. We have got watches in our hands - all the time we are saving time, saving time. And what are we saving? For wasting only. So time we are saving for ourselves, for our growth. If you do not grow now it's going to be very dangerous. You can see how the world is becoming dangerous - ecologically, physically, mentally - how many problems there are. Like this stress. Nobody knew what this stress was about 15 years back; people ignored it. All these things are coming up because of the complications human beings have created. But in a way it's good - because of these complications only they are seeking the truth and because of the truth they’ll find the peace.

Question: Can you tell us about dieting?

Shri Mataji: I'll tell you what. It's the prakruti of a person, is the personality of a person that's important. Now we have two types of people, definitely one are left-sided and right-sided. Right-sided people have to have more carbohydrates. The left-sided people have to have more proteins. And the central people are the people who are ascending; for them also a diet which is not so much [UNCLEAR], which doesn't come out of the Mother Earth. So it is definitely according to the person, how a person has to have. And gradually you yourself will know what sort of a diet you need. But after some time there is nothing like dieting, you can have whatever you like. But say there is a patient with only right-side and his liver will be out - as I told you yesterday how with liver you get asthma, this, that, all these problems - so the liver has to be cured. For that there is a diet; for a month you have to do the liver diet. Once you are finished with the liver diet you are alright. So diet is not such an important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

Actually Sahaja Yoga gives you complete freedom, absolutely no restrictions because you become your own master, you don't do wrong things; you just don't do it. Overnight people have given up drugs, overnight, drugs. Overnight so many things have happened because as I told you yesterday the story that if it is complete darkness and you are holding onto a snake, for example, and if somebody tells you, "Now throw away, that's a snake." you may not believe and you won't throw it till it bites you. But in the light, as soon as a little light comes you'll throw it away by yourself, nobody has to tell you.

Question: Is there any possible danger in the practice of yoga?

Shri Mataji: Not at all, never. You see, these people who have written against the Kundalini are all tantrikas - the people who are misusing this knowledge. If you say, supposing a villager comes and puts his fingers in the plug and then says that, "I got the shock." then you can only say that he doesn't know, he has no knowledge. But kundalini is your own mother and as your mother took all the labour things upon herself, she takes all the labour things upon herself; except sometimes you might feel a little heat - that's all - coming out; that's important, the heat must go out of your body.

But these people might have done it because they do not want people to get their Self-realisation also. And none of them say that they can give Self-realisation because they cannot. It's mostly a commercial activity whether it is in the name of God or in the name of Kundalini, it's all commercial activity. As this Mother Earth doesn't understand money, in the same way your kundalini doesn't understand money.

Question: Is it to be done with supervision or we can we do it at home?

Shri Mataji: If you'll come to the collective they'll tell you what it's to be done - how to work it out at home. And then you have to again meet in the collective, they'll tell you what is to be done; it is not a supervision but just a guideline till you become perfected in the art, in the state. And then you yourself can do it. That is how Sahaja Yoga has spread.

Like say Martin, when he came suddenly started Sahaja Yoga there. Or she, Janine, she got her realisation in Switzerland, she came here and she started Sahaja Yoga here, it's like that.

Question: After how long practice one can enlighten the yoga?

Shri Mataji: No, no, first I'll give you realisation just now. And it's a different song because you have, I mean the way you are you will get it in no time because if you are anxious to do it honestly it works out very fast. You touch your depth very fast, it's not so difficult. But if you are all the time doubting yourself and this and that then it takes little time but in any case it works, in any case. So far I have not known anyone who has been coming to Sahaja Yoga and has not got that depth. So you all have that depth within yourself. And this is what it is that immediately you start feeling it and immediately you start feeling this cool breeze and then you don't think about it because you are beyond your mind. It starts working, the kundalini itself rises again and again.

Yes, madam.

Question: Can you feel [UNCLEAR]?

Shri Mataji: First you just feel here but later on what happens that - there is the innermost nadi, it's called Brahma nadi - through which few hair like energy passes, first of all, and opens this and that's how the grace starts falling on your sympathetic nervous system - these are two nadis.

I think you all understand English, don't you? Who doesn't understand English? At all? Alright, then tell her.

The centres are like this, the left and the right side. [Shri Mataji shows with her hands.] Now when you use right too much or left, see the center? Becomes constricted. And when the grace starts falling on these two sides of these channels, then they are released and they open out more and more strands of kundalini rise. It works very fast. You don't have to worry about how much time it will take. Actually you enjoy it so much and your attention becomes so peaceful that you just feel that you are in meditation.

And once you become fully enlightened then you start giving realisation to another person it's the most joyous, most joyous. Actually we do not know how glorious we are. Like, say, in an Indian village you take a television and show and say that, "In this box you can see all kinds of films and things." they will say, "Oh, how can it be? This is just a box." But if you put it to the mains then it's fantastic. Then you start enjoying yourself only.

There was somebody, he was asking some question there. Or have I answered you already?

Question: How do you feel the Kundalini?

Shri Mataji: No, you just feel, you first feel the cool breeze on top of your head. You feel the cool breeze all around yourself. And then you feel your own centres on your fingertips, you know. Like these are five, six and seven centres on the left side and this is on the right side: again, one, five, so six and seven; seven centres on the right side and seven centres on the left side.

Question: Do you feel the cool breeze?Shri Mataji: No, not me. I don't feel anything. Yes, you can feel it yourself.

Question: Why some people are poor and some people are rich? Why we are not all same?

Shri Mataji: It depends on what kind of desires they had in previous lives and how they have spent their life before in their evolution, what is their prakruti - what is their aptitude. This is what makes your jaati, not the cast but jaati. It's said that your caste is not the thing, it's what your aptitudes are, what you are seeking in life. But to think that the rich people are happy is your wrong idea, completely wrong. The richest countries are like Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, they are all competing among themselves how many are going to commit suicide.

But after Sahaja Yoga you find that you are blessed very much, even materially, financially to such an extent that you feel absolutely satisfied. And this idea of poverty and richness all finishes with that, then you want to be spiritually rich. Now for example, I have all the powers, supposing, then I am the greatest capitalist because I’ve got the powers. But I cannot be happy unless and until I give it to others so I'm the greatest communist also. I'm about 68 years of age and I'm travelling like mad just to give to people. There is no need for me - I’m financially quite alright, everything fine, my family is good - but I can't help it.

So this idea of some people rich, some people poor, it comes out of ignorance. After Sahaja Yoga practically everybody gains a lot and also try to help each other. It's very amazing how this new generation, of new age, these people are so beautiful. They are angels.

Question: Can Sahaja Yoga help children in education and improve their status?

Shri Mataji: Of course, very much. We have children who were very dull in their classes and they got realisation - they are standing first. Most of the scholarships, they are the ones who are buying all the scholarships all over. Not only that but we also have got schools of Sahaja Yoga for children.

Question: Is Sahaja Yoga ancient?

Shri Mataji: Yes, it's very ancient. Sahaja Yoga is extremely ancient but recently you can see that, "Sahaja samadhi lago” (Get Sahaja meditation), Guru Nanak Dev has said, "Sahaja samadhi lago” but Sahaja is a very ancient technique; it was used by the Nath pundits like Goraknath, Machindranath. Machindranath came to Bangkok also, he came to Burma. His disciple was Goraknath. But it was a tradition that one master will have only one disciple - that's why because [it's] the tradition. And the .... Of course, in the 14th century - fourteen thousand years back you can say - Markandeya has written about Kundalini. Also there is mentioned about it quite a lot by Adi Shankaracharya in the sixth century. But only at the time, in the twelfth century, when Gyaneshwara came he requested his guru - was his brother - that, "You should allow me to talk about Kundalini in an open way." And in his book "Gyaneshwari" he has written in the sixth chapter very clearly about Sahaja Yoga.

Question: How long is needed?

Shri Mataji: First you'll have your Self-realisation in no time, no time at all. It depends on. It hardly takes at the most, for anyone, more than one month. It's very simple, it works out very fast. It's nothing, you cannot say so many days, so many hours, so many minutes, like that. Because how can you say how long will it take for this flower to come out? It’s like this, it's a living process, depends on the personality. Some people do it the very same day they get realisation they jump into their depth; some people do. Some people take time. Like we have here now one Thai gentleman passed by - he got it, his realisation, the moment he was there. So it is not time, it is the personality that makes the difference.

Question: How long did it take you to get it?

Shri Mataji: Nothing, I was born like this. I was just born like this; I didn't take any time. After your realisation you'll know more about me. Alright?

So should we now have the Self-realisation?

So at the very outset I have to say that I cannot force Sahaja Yoga on anyone. You have to ask for it, you have to desire it because I respect your freedom. And because it is complete freedom, this freedom has to be respected. So one has to take an attitude that you want your Self-realisation.

There are three conditions before we start that I would like to tell you. The first one is that you are not to feel guilty. Whatever you have done in your past just forget it. As I told you before also that you are human beings and only human beings can commit mistakes. Gods cannot commit mistakes. And animals never think they are committing mistakes; animals never think that way. We only, the human beings in this intermediary state have this problem that we feel guilty for everything. Also one thing is that we should not suffer to get our Self-realisation. God Almighty is the most loving father, he is father of all the fathers and how would he like you to suffer to attain him? Why he would do that? Which father would do that?

So the second condition is that you should forgive everyone in general. Some people say that it’s difficult to forgive but actually whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. So you just torture yourself under a myth and the one who has troubled you is quite happy. So why torture yourself? You don't have to think whom you have to forgive. Just forgive in general; don't think about anyone.

Now the third condition is that you have to be very confident that you will all get your Self-realisation.

These are the three conditions. If you don't forgive then there will a problem on this centre - Agnya chakra - because it's tight like this, very constricted. But if you forgive it releases and it becomes openable and the kundalini can pass through it. And if you feel guilty then the centre here - left side centre – goes into jeopardy and as a result you get horrible diseases. One of them is angina, it's kind of a, you get heart attack. And then another one is spondylitis - when the disks slip out.

So now I don't want to frighten you anymore. What I'm trying to tell is that you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

Alright. I have to request you to take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. And you have to put both your foot little away from each other because these are two powers, left and right. Left side is the power of desire and the right side is the power of action.

So now you have to place your left hand towards me like this, comfortably on your lap, which is symbolic and is suggesting that you want, you desire your realisation. Now you have to use your right hand for nourishing your centres.

Please take out your shoes. You may take out your shoes and also spectacles because sometimes it's better. And please don't open your eyes till I tell you. But just now I'll show you and afterwards you can take out your spectacles.

Now please put your left hand towards me like this and right hand on your heart. In the heart resides your Spirit. Now please take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. We are working only on the left hand side. This is the centre of your mastery which is created by great prophets and great masters. Now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge; pure knowledge because it manifests on your central nervous system by which you feel the all-pervading Power and by which you know the laws of the Divine; and by which you know how to use this power. Now you have to raise your hand again onto the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Then you have to raise it onto your heart again. Now you have to raise it in on the corner of your neck and your shoulder as far back as possible and turn your head to your right. I've already told you that this centre catches when you feel guilty. Now put your right hand on your forehead across and now bend your head as much as possible. This is the centre to forgive everyone in general. Now we take back our right hand on the backside of our head. Hold the head properly and push back your head as far as possible. This is the centre where - without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction - you have to ask forgiveness from this divine Power of love. Now the last centre. You open out your palm fully. Put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers as far as possible. Put down your head. Push back your fingers to put a good pressure on your scalp. You have to push down your head nicely otherwise it won't work out. And now move your scalp clockwise slowly seven times. Push back your fingers otherwise the pressure won't be there. That's all we have to do.

So now we close our eyes, put the left hand towards me like this, both the feet away from each other and right hand on your heart. Here you have to say - you can call me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji", whatever you like - in your heart you have to ask a very fundamental question three times. Here you ask the question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

If you are the Spirit, you are your guide, you are your light, you are your master. So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard, on the left hand side and press it hard. And ask another question three times, "Mother, am I my own master?"

I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now take your right hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say six times because this centre has got six petals, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." As soon as you ask for pure knowledge your kundalini starts rising.

So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. We have to now open all these centres with our self-confidence. So here you say ten times with full confidence, "Mother, I am my own master."

I've already told you that the truth about you is that you are the pure Spirit. You are not this body, you are not this intellect, you are not these emotions, you are not this ego or you are not these conditionings but you are pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart please and here you say 12 times with full confidence, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

This all-pervading divine Power is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of joy and bliss. It is the ocean of compassion but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you might have committed this ocean of forgiveness is very powerful to dissolve it. So now raise your right hand onto the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your rightfully. Here you have to say with full confidence, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." Say it 16 times.

I've already told you whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and you torture yourself. So now raise your right hand on top of your forehead and please put down your head as much as you can. And here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

Now please take back your hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to say for your own satisfaction, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, "Oh, Divine Power, if I have done any mistake please forgive me." This also you have to say from your heart, not how many times.

Now stretch your hand fully, stretch your palm and put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area. Now put down your head. Press back your fingers so that the pressure is alright. Here again I cannot cross over your freedom. I cannot force Self-realisation on you, you have to ask for it. So please move your hand clockwise, move your scalp actually clockwise saying seven times, "Mother, please give me my Self-realisation."

Please take down your hand. Put both the hands towards me like this and watch me without thinking. Now please put your right hand like this and put down your head, and see for yourself with your left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area; don't doubt it. Don't put it on top of the head but little away from it. Some people feel it much further. Yes, good.

Now please put now left hand towards me like this and put down your head again, and see with the right hand. There may be hot breeze because you have not forgiven. Please forgive otherwise it won't work out, I'm telling you, please forgive.

Now please put right hand towards Me and bend your head again, and see with the left hand if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

Now please raise both your hands towards the sky like this and push back your head. And now here you ask a question three times, "Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God's love? Mother, is this the cool breeze of the paramchaitanya? Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Ask anyone of these questions three times. Now please put down your hands.

Now those who have felt cool or hot breeze out of their heads or in their hands, please raise both your hands, both your hands. Alright.

May God bless you.

Most of you felt it and I would like to meet all of you one by one. I would like to see why you two didn't feel it; you should have felt it. Now come along.

[Shri Mataji works on individual seekers on the stage until the end of the video.]
