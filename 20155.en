Talk Language: Hindi | Translation (Hindi to English) - Draft

When we cannot  even feel something, when we cannot experience it, then how can we say that we are this or we are  that? First and foremost, it is essential to know oneself. Even in the Quran, Prophet Muhammad wrote many things. ‘This is my hand, these are my feet, this is my body, this belongs to me.’ But who is that ‘me’? It is important to know that ‘I’. And for that, there is no need for chanting or penance. There is no need to do anything. The Kundalini energy that is there within you once awakened,when it will unite you with the Param Chaitanya , you will understand for yourself in the light of the spirit what you are. “So, you will come to know about  yourself. You will also understand your body and the questions you have regarding it—you can even cure those. Many physical questions have been cured through Sahaja Yoga, there is no  doubt in that. Blood cancers  have been cured , cancers have been cured, and even AIDS has been cured. But people suffering from AIDS are often extremely stubborn and highly egotistical, making it very difficult to tell them that they need to humble down a little, it’s a very difficult thing. However, many such diseases are being cured today through Sahaja Yoga. In that you don’t need to spend any money; unlike hospitals where they kill you by so many  diagnoses,  you don’t have to do any such thing. On your fingertips , you can understand what illness you have. You will yourself know what your illness is, and the treatment of this illness is very simple. After much effort, after many days , in Vashi we have finally established a curative center where you can go and even get your diseases cured. But why should one cure a disease? Why do we need a healthy body? Even wrestlers come to us and say, ‘Mother, please give us peace. We have had enough; our bodies are already strong, but now we need peace. This peace will come only after knowing yourself—when you understand how glorious you are , how magnificent you are and how powerful you are. At that moment, this peace will be established within you, and all unnecessary thoughts that bother you day and night and trouble you will disappear. This peace that you have to establish , there is a great need for this peace. After attaining this peace, you will begin to realize many other things that are there within you. How much kindness is there, creativity is there. People who had never written poetry before , who never understood what a poem is ,suddenly became great poets, great speakers, great orators, and great musicians. People have completely transformed after coming to Sahaja Yoga—not just one or two , but countless , countless people.

But the difficulty is that the seekers should be real people. Like it is said in Marathi it is said ‘chala paaijey jyati che’. People who are actually standing on the truth and want that we should attain only the truth - only the truth, not the truth that I said something or you did not say something, no only the truth. Meaning that when all these people attain it, they say the same thing - they say the same thing. Like if you make ten small children sit, blindfold them and ask them that this man is in front of you, what illness does he have? Then all of them will raise one finger or will raise two fingers, all will raise the same. Because everyone will feel the same thing, will have the same experience which is the truth.

These days many of your people have come out, wherever you look, there are their advertisements for these Babaji people. There are Babajis and many Babrijis too. All have opened up shops. There is no need to go too far, if someone opens a shop, then you should understand that he is a big thief. But if you want to find out, then you can find out through Sahaja Yoga by putting your hands in this way that this man who calls himself a great saint, is he a big saint or not? Immediately you will know on your fingertips which chakras of this person are catching. And how much of a liar he is. Many people come after getting released from jail. If they have been released from a jail in UP,  they will come here wearing saffron clothes and if they get released from here, they will go there. It is such a big country, who knows everything. And everyone roams around  Babajis. And many people are following such Babajis. People think that now that we have money, let's go to Babaji and get something from him. How can you buy with money - does God understand money?

You also think about  it , use your brains- if a person asks you for money, then what is the big deal if I get it with money. This thing cannot be obtained with money. This is beyond money, only through your own power that resides within you and it is very easy for you to get it. This is your own power. There is no need to borrow it from anywhere. You do not need to get any certificate for it. You will get it yourself and you will know that you have achieved it.

There is a saying in Sanskrit - Na hi Kasturikamodah Shapathen Vibhavyate. It means that when musk is placed in front of you, you don’t have to take an oath that it is musk. Its fragrance is there. Similarly, when you get self-realization, get it awakened inside you, you know that you have got your self-realization. There is no need for anyone else's certificate. But whatever benefits you get after getting it, they are countless , countless. Like I said, first the physical benefits, then the mental - the person becomes peaceful. Now, I don't know how many things people talk about in the world for peace. There should be peace, there should be peace...how will there be peace. Unless there is peace within you , how can there be peace? Those people who say that they have come to bring peace, they are reciting peace, they themselves do not have peace. Such people have no right to give peace or to take any reward for peace.

Now we should know that all our physical, mental, intellectual, all kinds of questions get resolved. So someone asked me, "Will my  financial problems also get solved? I said yes, why not. Financial problems would also get resolved. The most important thing for financial problems is satisfaction . You should understand one thing today: if you need something, let's say, I buy a motor. I bought the motor, but it's not a solution. After that, I need to buy a house. I bought the house, but still, it's not a solution..You are not going to get satisfaction because as it is written in economics, it is written in economics that the wants of a human being in general are never satiable. Today if there is one then there is another, if there is second then third, if there is third then a fourth. But after this one gets satisfaction. Satisfaction means that today I thought let's meet everyone . Then I see that person coming in front of me . The person I had to meet is coming right in front. Oh ! I thought you were in Delhi - no no, I came here only yesterday and I came to meet you. Whatever you wish for, even the slightest thing, it will appear in front of you immediately. This is amazing. People call this a miracle, I do not consider it a miracle, this power which is spread all around, this powerful,  wise,  loving power, it makes arrangements for everything. Because of this power you are completely fearless within yourself. No one can touch you. No one can trouble you, the one who troubles you , he himself will be defeated. You will be amazed that every moment you will see how this power is working with you. I am not lying to you. It is absolutely true that it is very important to enter into this power. Because if it belongs to you and you have to get it, then why do you refuse it ? Then why don't you have enough understanding, why don't you  have the understanding  that what is ours , why don’t we get it ? Why don't we get what is our property? The second thing that happens is that your attention becomes completely calm. And in that attention light enters. In that light you see what is bad for you and what is good. A person develops many habits. Such habits  which he cannot get rid of himself. He tries very hard and all those are destructive habits. He tries very hard to get rid of this but he cannot. The reason for this is that man is still in a bonded state. He is still a prisoner. But when he attains this thing, in this light , everything he gets rid of. Like you have a snake in your hand and you do not want to let go of it in the dark, thinking it is a rope. But as soon as a little light comes in , on its own that thing is got rid of. Like such a great wonderful person gets awakened within you which is so powerful that any kind of destructive habit , destructive talk , everything is got rid of. A new form is awakened from within you. Like a lotus flower which grows in the mud and fills the whole place with fragrance. In the same way your personality is formed. It is inherent within you. You have all these things within you. To attain this, you only need pure desire. When you have this pure desire that we also have to attain this thing which is within us, we have to attain it, then all this happens. This attention becomes so enlightened that wherever your attention will go, it will work out. Wherever you look, it will happen there. Like you are watching television, understand, on television, someone is saying something, he is saying but his saying has no effect. It has no result. You are just watching. But if your attention goes somewhere, then wherever it goes, it will work, it will work out. And you will be surprised how it happens? How did it happen so quickly? Because this power resides in everything, in every atom, it thinks , it understands everything and the most important thing is that it loves you.

This is the power of love. And as soon as this power of love awakens within you, you are filled with compassion. Many have talked about bringing compassion within you, but compassion does not come within anyone by saying this. It does not come by saying anything. On the contrary, I have seen that many people who do a lot of penance and become very religious are very short-tempered. They have a lot of anger. One should stay away from them. Because what they are doing , in them power has not yet come from above. For example, Just imagine that there is a telephone and we are trying it again and again. It will get damaged, if its connection is not there, then who are we calling on the telephone. Similarly, in all our actions, there remains no meaning . Like this is an instrument and if it is not connected to the mains then it is of no use, it has no meaning. Similarly, our life also has no meaning. When there is no meaning in our life then we can do whatever we want. At least in this country we are traditionally religious. In this country we also understand that we should get self-realization. There are many things in us that bind us in one format, in one path. But if you go to other countries, people do strange things which make it seem that they do not know who they are. Like they will cut all the hair, they will make a punk hair style , they will wear some strange clothes, it is not understandable, women will wear clothes like men, men will wear clothes like women, they think that by doing all this they will become special. By doing this, how are they going to become special ? This is only madness. And that too such madness that what should we do now and how do we establish that we are something.

It has reached to such an extent that the countries which are very prosperous, countries which we call Sweden, Switzerland, and countries like this, the young people there, not only young people but people up to forty years of age, are committing suicide there. There is so much money, everything is there, why are you committing suicide? From there, people come sometimes in London to meet me, and then they started saying to me, 'Mother, tell us, we feel like committing suicide I said why? They say, what is the point of living? What do we have to do? What do we have to do by living? Everyone is living like this, we don't want to live like this. What is our importance? What is our need? It is better that we would like to die. Where it has reached the extreme limit, wealth, where people think that we have got a lot, now we don't need it, it's enough. Only then this element awakens in us where we search. And the element of searching that has started, we call it that this person has now become a seeker. There are many such seekers outside. There is no doubt about it but you have exported a lot of gurus from here - they are eating off them, drinking off them ,befooling them. But you are an Indian. You should think that India is really a great land of yoga. Yes, we have a lot of traitors here, we have a lot of bad things here, but even if we say a lot, the percentage is very little . And all these people will be put in place. The importance of this should be thought about, there have been great saints and sages in this country. And you have come to prove what they have said. You have come to this world today, you are going to get all those things which have been promised to you, this responsibility is on you. Forget the traitors. Forget the wrong people. Forget the evil people. There is no cure for them. Namdev has said that one who is evil  remains wicked. One should stay away from it. It is like a fly, if it sits on food, you  vomit and if you accidentally eat a fly, even if it dies, it will kill you. Similarly, there are evil people. I do not have anything to do with them. I am concerned with those people who  in general society are good people and who do not understand why they have come into this world.

Many people become bad because they do not have any support. We have to find our own support. We do not need to go to any Guru, nothing. You are going to be your own Guru. You are going to get your own guidance and by walking along that guidance you will understand what you are, you are no less. You are special , in  a human form and you are born on this land of India which is a great land of Yoga. Believe me, it is a great land of Yoga. Every part of it is filled with vibrations , every particle is filled with vibrations . And when you become enlightened you will understand how great this earth is on which you are sitting today. And greatness that you have become a citizen of , is also because you have done a lot of good deeds, otherwise it is not easy to be born here. At the same time, many wicked people are also born to test you. No matter how many evil  people come and go , when you become awakened, their evil  will itself become apparent .They will fall in the eyes of the world. These are not just big talks, this is the reality and all this is within you. You will say that mother you are talking about very special things. The whole world becomes special when you get the sight of the spirit once. You will understand all the saints. All the big things that you have heard and seen and read, all of them will start becoming visible. Till now you were only trapped in the web of words. You will develop such a personality that the world will be surprised to see that  this was the same person of yesterday and what happened to him today. This compassion has not been used by anyone till date. No one has used this power. No one has used the power of love till date. There is some power of creating differences, like 'Come on, even if nothing else, you are different, you are different, fight with them, fight with those. But the biggest thing in the power of love is that you all become one together.

Today you know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading very fast in sixty-five countries and I don't know, people are saying that there are many more countries than this. But the countries in which Sahaja Yoga is spreading very fast ,sixty-five countries. And every Sahaja Yogi of these sixty-five countries is your close one. Like Gyandev has said "Thechi Soyri Kot" they will become your relatives and you will be surprised that from where did all these people come together for me. From where did all these relatives of mine come together? The real relatives. They are not concerned with your property, they are not concerned with your purse. They are only concerned with your love. It is very important to enter this world of love. Until you do not know this world of love, you cannot understand your own importance , how great you are. With this power of this love, you can encompass the whole world. Because a new consciousness has awakened within you. And that consciousness is called collective consciousness through which you can feel others. For example, if a person comes in front of you, he is in a bad condition. Just now a gentleman came, I immediately understood what his problem was. But he started getting restless, started acting, there is no need for drama. I understood what problem he was facing and that problem can be cured not by getting restless here, but by doing Sahaja Yoga. If he does Sahaja Yoga, all these problems will go away. But he came here to perform a drama, let him do it. There is no benefit in that. The benefit will be when your kundalini awakens and unites you with this supreme power. My talks and speeches also will not make any difference. The only difference will be from this event. Which is called actualization. That should happen in person. It should be experienced. When it is experienced then you will also realize yourself and you will understand that what I am telling you is absolutely true.

For this you should know that after all this happens you enter into the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is completely enlightened. And His work is so beautiful and so enjoyable , just like the drama is performed. In the same way, in his kingdom Param Chaitanya gets activated. There is no power more intelligent, more loving and more efficient than this.

What I tell you about this, it will still be less. But I will say that you  experience it. You should get the experience of it which is your right. You should get it. It is not difficult. Now see, I have been working hard in the city of Bombay for years now. But the people here still do not have their attention where they should look for it. Their attention is elsewhere. That is why they were moving around. But wherever people have steadied their attention on it and those who have thought that it is to be  achieved firstly and then we will see later, those people have gone very deep and they have got many benefits, many benefits and the biggest benefit beyond these benefits is that you drown in the ocean of bliss.

In India, it is not so much, but if you walk on the road outside, it seems as if these people are returning from a cremation ground. Such dejected faces, such sad people, I have never seen them laughing. This idea that is stuck in our head that we are very sad, and that many destructive powers are active inside us, these people are sad only because of such mental concepts. But there is no such thing. They do not understand that through this infinite power hidden within us , not only will we become happy but we will  drown in the ocean of bliss. Bliss is the one which is singular , there is no such thing as happiness and sorrow in it. Only bliss. And you get immersed in it. You become lost in bliss. That is why any kind of calamity which people consider a very big calamity is nothing, it can be cured in a moment. All these powers are inside you and you can attain these powers, there is no need to work hard for it, no need to fast or to do anything.

Last time also the program was held here, many people came and many received it. Even after receiving it I say that this time for the first time I saw that the newspapers of Bombay wrote something good. Otherwise they always used to write nonsense. For the first time the minds of the newspapers also opened up, they wrote that many people raised their hands and many people experienced this. After this many people came also and even now we have made such a complete arrangement that even after this, like if something sprouts, then to take it forward we also have centers. It is not that after the introduction lecture is over, after that you have to pay money, there is absolutely no concern with money. You go and like a tree, you establish yourself, you grow. This is a very easy thing. There is no need to pay a penny for it. Yes, it is like here, money must have been given to electricity or some other things, that is a different matter. But for your self-realization and your self-upliftment, for increasing the light of your spirit  in your consciousness, you do not need to pay any money. It grows on its own. That is why the most pure thing inside you is your spirit , which you should attain. Till today it was sitting as a witness, watching, now it should come to your attention . And as soon as it comes, the state of your evolution which is of a human today will reach that  of super-human. This is not a lie at all, the time has come for this to happen. In this, it may be that if you have some disease or some other obsession in your mind or if some guru has spoiled your kundalini a little, then it is possible that awakening may not happen today. There is no harm in it. No. But till date I have not seen anyone who has come to Sahaja Yoga and says that nothing happened. You will have to come to the centers once or twice, and our centers are also very simple. Because it is not that we have taken any money. So  to any simple place, any school or any place where the centres have been you please come. And come and get this, andTo fully honor your self-realization, it is something that is obligatory and binding for you. If you do not respect yourself then who will respect you. How can a person who has not respected his own spirit get any respect? But if you recognize your self-realization and accept it humbly then this thing will definitely happen and it will happen you will see for yourself how you have reached from where to where.

Now to say how you should be called, how you should be treated,  you should be invited , this I don’t understand. Like there are some cities where thousands of people come without being invited. They have come to Sahaja Yoga without doing anything. In a city like Lucknow where people only know how to eat, drink and have fun, thousands of people have become Sahaja Yogis. I went there only once and 30 IAS officers became Sahaja Yogis. Will any IAS officer come here? It is a difficult task. Just like it is said ‘ karela neem chadha’. The atmosphere of Bombay city  itself is bad. And if anything happens in this atmosphere  it happens with great difficulty. But still you must understand that you are not the residents of this city of Bombay. You are the residents of that city where there is a shower of joy all the time. You are welcome there, come and get it. My infinite blessings to all of you.

Now the work of awakening the Kundalini - it takes ten minutes at the most, not more than that. But here people look at the watch a lot. Do not look at the watch at this time, and those who do not want to take it, please go away because there can be no compulsion in this. Those who do want to receive it (break in video) awaken us, then never, your Kundalini itself, the Kundalini of such a boisterous person never rises. So humbly receive this thing. And as soon as you have humbly asked for this thing, you will get your own power. Nothing will happen by discussing  it or thinking about it. Because we have to  go beyond our thoughts. It is not right to think at this time. You do not even have to stop your thoughts, I am not saying anything. But your thoughts will stop automatically. So please just keep this desire in your mind that this has to happen with us and we want it , our pure desire  is that we should receive our  Self-realization.

Just come forward so those people will also sit down.

See, the wonder of India is that in India, awakening happens in 10 minutes. And in foreign lands, my hands get broken. Awakening does not happen for hours, but whatever happens, they get established very well. Because if something is available cheaply or easily in our country, then there is no value for it. If we go and sit on a mountain and you have to climb to get it  and you remain troubled there for at least two hours, then you will think that yes  you have climbed such a mountain, at least something should happen. But the thing is that nowadays it  does not give much time, so this is going to happen very quickly in Sahaja. This is needed. Not only this, Param Chaitanya himself wants that as soon as possible you all should get it. It is the will of God due to which this work is happening so quickly. It is so easy but still it is very important to respect yourself completely, to respect your self-realization.

If someone does not get it, then we have centers here, we will tell you about it, please write it down, and you will see that after this you will feel very good. You will become calm and will feel light. After that they also kept very good music. There is a Sahaj Yogini whom (Unclear) should listen to, similarly she has achieved a lot in Sahaj Yoga. There will be her singing , you will see that that singing will give you immense joy and peace from within.

Now I have told you earlier that there are one or two conditions. Firstly, the condition is that you should not listen to any low things about yourself. That is, if someone tells you that you are a sinner, that you did these deeds in your previous life, now you reap that , there is no such thing in Sahaja Yoga . When you are sitting in front of us today, you are my children and you are completely pure. You should have this belief in your heart that neither are you a sinner, nor is there anything low in you. You are not guilty. Not guilty at all. Those who think that we are guilty and we have made a mistake, how will it happen to us, if they have this kind of an attitude,this chakra of theirs gets caught here. And due to this chakra getting caught, you can get many diseases like spondylitis, angina, and all the organs of the body also become absolutely lazy, lethargic. So what is the need to dwell on something that has already happened, a mistake that must have been made. If you keep troubling yourself with such false things, then kindly forgive yourself. You should have a happy disposition towards yourself. Have respect for yourself. I have already told you, I respect you, I love you, similarly you should also have a feeling of respect towards yourself. And in the same way, a feeling of love. So sit with a pleasant disposition.

The second thing to be said is that just like you forgive yourself, you should forgive the whole world. Because whether you forgive others or not, you really do not do anything in that way. But in this matter, we don't even think about why we don't forgive anyone. When we don't forgive others, we deceive ourselves. And the one who needs to be forgiven is sitting comfortably. Therefore, forgive everyone together, without thinking about them. Because thinking about them is also a big headache. Therefore, please forgive everyone together. You should forgive everyone together. When you forgive everyone together, you will be surprised that you will feel very light from within. You are carrying a useless burden. Therefore, forgive the whole world together. It will be of great benefit. Because of that, this chakra of yours, which is the Agya Chakra, is tied in this way. It is very narrow, the Kundalini just cannot pass through it. But it opens up as soon as you forgive. And as soon as it opens, Kundalini will easily ascend through it.

Due to these two chakras, many times awakening does not happen, that is why I have requested you to forgive yourself and open this chakra  by forgiving everyone. Even if it opens a little, it is fine. Then Kundalini will open it herself. Otherwise, she will have to fight, she will have to come and push it. Therefore, to make her work easy, to make it sahaja , you do these two things, that you forgive yourself and forgive others. From the mind, from the heart.

The third thing is that it is better that you remove your slippers and shoes and put your feet on the ground because I have told you the importance of this ground, those who sit on the ground are fine but it is better if they remove their slippers and shoes.

Now I told you  that  in these five fingers , the 6th and 7th , there are chakras here and here are the 6th and 7th chakras, the sympathetic nervous endings are there. So you should keep both your hands towards me in this manner. Both hands.

Many people say that this is mesmerism. If by mesmerism a person becomes so good  then it is not a bad thing. But in mesmerism, people do it by looking into each other's eyes. But I close my eyes and you will also be closing your eyes. Both hands towards me. Now bend your head a little and keep your left hand towards me and right hand on the Fontanelle bone area which in Marathi is called talumantar and secondly, on the Fontanelle bone area which in our childhood was a very soft bone , on top of that , ‘adatri’ on top , not touching it keep your right hand . Bend your head and see if from here from this Brahmarandra, cold or hot air is coming out. Do not doubt. At this time, see, not even a leaf is moving anywhere. But if it is coming from your head. Now, right hand towards me and bend your head and see with your left hand whether from this palate area which in English is called the Fontanelle bone area and in spirituality what is called Brahmarandra , see if cold or hot air is coming out. Like Adi Shankaracharya has described it - Saleelam Saleelam, cold cold. Now again, turn the left hand towards me. And  keep the right hand again on the palate. Sometimes it is in front, sometimes at the back. To some people , very strongly , when it comes , it comes  till very far , like a jet. From anywhere, cold or hot air - like waves, waves of consciousness can be seen coming out from your own palate. Now both hands towards me. Again, do it  . And if  hot air was coming out of it, it means that you have not forgiven , either yourself or others, you have not forgiven. At this time, say from your mind that I have forgiven everyone. From your mind. Now see if cold or hot air is flowing in your hand. Now look towards me and become thoughtless. Do not think. You can do it. If you do not doubt. Try to become thoughtless. Now put both hands towards the sky. And tilt  your head backwards. And ask a question three times, tilting your head back and looking  towards the sky – call me mother or Shri Mataji – Shri Mataji is this the Paramchaitanya? Ask this question three times. Now if cold cold  air starts coming , then say three times that this is the Paramchaitanya. Three times. Now put your hands down. Now again put both hands towards me and become thoughtless. Some people will get cold air from below. Pick it up and bring it on top. Now those who on their hands, on their fingers, on their palms or from  their Brahmarandhra, have felt cold or hot air ,all of them should raise their hands. Both hands. From all of  Bombay , all the people who are here today and those who have come from outside , to all of you my Namaskar . Now, your life will begin like that of the saints begin. You don't have to leave anything because you have not held on to anything, such a condition will arise. My infinite blessings to all of you. But now the seed has been sprouted, it should grow into  trees. If all of you who are here become like a tree, then each person can light so many lamps. And with this the whole world can change. I am talking about the transformation of the whole world. I hope you will cooperate in this and you will progress not only yourself but also with this you will help other people and countries progress. You do not know that  in the entire world people will consider you to be the greatest person. In spirituality. And they themselves will come to your feet here, they will understand that they are Indians. Until we have not achieved self-realization, we are not Indians. The biggest thing about being an Indian is the desire for self-realization and achieving it in today's time. My infinite blessings to everyone.

As I said, there will be some nice and wonderful music for a while. Sahaja Yogini has come. You should listen to her song. Since her young age  I have been listening to her for 20-22 years. She is still very young. But the way she sings, it seems that she has been infused with divine power. You must see it, it is a miracle. Last time you saw the miracle that how people from Romania had come and they had sung such a wonderful qawwali. Everyone stopped and started thinking how did this happen. You have to see the second miracle. Even before that, you have seen the song that was sung here , how wonderful it was.
