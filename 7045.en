Idea to start Yuva Shakti, Ganapatipule (India), 4 January 1988.

Mr. Pradhan is a very humble person. He didn't tell you, that we have started a, I mean, he actually brought the idea to start a, another subsidiary you can call it, or whichever way you may say, another parallel movement, called as "Yuva Shakti". Which is meant for the young people in Sahaja Yoga. For their guidance, for their expression, and for their dedication. And, this is spreading so fast now that I am told we have got Yuva Shakti even in Pune. And may be, it might spread to other places, to other countries, so that they can correspond, have a rapport, try to understand each other. So, this is a new movement, which was really suggested by Mr. Pradhan, and I really heartily congratulate him for putting it into action. (Applause).

No doubt, we must care for our young people. And look after them and give them their due respect and they must know their due duties towards Sahaja Yoga. I found them to be excellent workers, very dedicated innocent hands that I have got. I am very proud of them. And please give them a hand to all the young people. (Applause).

So there will be, we have another group, now here, it is Ashis who has come from Nagpur. He is a realized soul. He is a born realized, you see. And, like that we have many. Now here we have Ashok who is going to play the tabla. And Sanjay Shirshat, he is from Bombay. And also we have got Dhakde, Guruji's younger brother Mr. Dhakde, who is going to help them. And the senior person is Mr. Jaganath Gurdey, who is going to play the clarinet as you saw him. So, is the blessings of all the elders, and what in Marathi you call "Kautuka", of the younger people that is going to express itself today. Tonight.

Thank You.
