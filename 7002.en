Advice to Austrians yogis, Nirmala House, 20 April 1987.

And that's why it's working out that way. Because if it was one sided, it should not have worked that way. It's both the sides are there. Come in, come in, come in, move forward.

[Inaudible ?]

How are the children? Are they all right? Yeah. Come on. Hamid is there or gone?

Yogi: Hamid is on the way. He is here.

Shri Mataji: He is here. I wanted to know about his experiment, what has happened?

Yogi: I think he did not continue so far.

Shri Mataji: Hamid, what has happened about your experiment? Of saving the... Come here, can't hear you. Come in, come in, come in.

Hamid: Mother at this moment it's impossible to go there. It's also about one meter of snow

Shri Mataji: Yes, I saw, I saw it while coming, but now how is it otherwise?

Hamid: I must go there.

Shri Mataji: But in the beginning how was that till now.

Hamid: In the beginning [it was nothing so bad ?] and last summer I was the last time there and I gave your pictures there at different places and vibrated with water and come back and now after winter I must go again there.

Shri Mataji: But why don't you take some water from here. Did you take from yesterday's puja?

Hamid: I did it. You have given me water from India.

Shri Mataji: What I thought that now when it was snowing everywhere the same water that is there can vibrate, and I was putting My eyes to the snow. So may it might have also. So that's one way because when it is snowing, before the snow if you put it then the vibrations can be taken over by the snow.

Hamid: We have put it before snowing.

Shri Mataji: Then it's all right. It might.

Hamid: I am going in month or in fifteen days I am going there and have a look, what's happening got [inaudible].

Shri Mataji: Then you can establish it and say something about it.

Hamid: I hope so, I hope so.

Shri Mataji: But did you publish anything in India about it? Not so far.

Hamid: We are not so far. I can write it down. I gave only this paper but I have found before this experiment.

Shri Mataji: Why not write it down? We'll publish it in India.

Hamid: Yes I will do it. And I am writing the next experiment for India. Last year we wanted to do it, I couldn't come. And I am writing down all the thing what we have to do there. May be Dr. [Sanghvi ?].

Shri Mataji: Now we have got thirty acres more - means fifty five.

Hamid: I have written already Dr. Sanghvi that he must sent me some samples from the earth and I can analyze it. And he hasn't known about it.

Shri Mataji: The trouble is you see they - come in, come in, come in, just move forward. You do not spread out so much you can work out that.

Hamid: [unclear] last time. [unclear] analyze it.

Shri Mataji: No the thing what happened.

Hamid: They haven't known about it.

Shri Mataji: No the thing what happened, at first I said you must have one plantation of sugarcane. Now for that they said to put it right you have to spend at least two lakhs of rupees, and they said one lakh of rupee is needed for the plantation. I said that is too much for us. So I said do one thing. I got some other people just looked at it, they said if you make different, different steps then it won't be so expensive.

Hamid: I have shown you Mother.

Shri Mataji: Yes you have given Me that, but the papers are with you still, I think.

Hamid: Yes, exactly.

Shri Mataji: Then you have to send them. If you send them to Sanghvi then I will work it out. Because now I have sanctioned, I said all right take one lakh of rupees to do that way and then work it out.

Hamid: Yes, and I have taken more projects but we couldn't use the whole land for experiment, we need only a couple of acres.

Shri Mataji: Just to show.

Hamid: To show somebody.

Shri Mataji: But first the sugarcane let it be, so that you have some money in hand to do your projects and things.

All right, I just wanted to know anyone of you know how to make the plasterboard. The Plasterboard.

Yogi: It's plastering?

Shri Mataji: Plasterboard.

Yogi: I don't think so, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: It's a secret.

Yogi: It's new for me.

Yogi: Unfortunately we don't have any.

Shri Mataji: You don't have any plasterboard? Then what do you do? You see when you have the wood how do you plaster it.

Yogi: When we have the wall.

Shri Mataji: The wood. You have wood that dries and we have to put a plasterboard on top and plaster it.

Yogi: Normally we don't plaster the wood Shri Mataji. We let it like it is. Normal.

Shri Mataji: You leave the wood like it is.

Yogi: We leave the wood naturally. We don't plaster it, in Austria.

Shri Mataji: So that would suit our project here what we want to make now. Isn't it, the hotel project? You leave the wood as it is.

Yogi: Yes, people like it just the wood, the natural wood.

Shri Mataji: Not in here. The Italians are like Indians they like everything polished, done, isn't it? They think it is a poor matched up. But you see in a hotel you get people from outside. They would love it.

Yogi: But we can plaster easily with panels, with plaster panels so we could cover the wood. This is possible. Plaster panels, readymade.

Shri Mataji: That's what I'm saying. Do you know how to make the plaster panels?

Yogi: We can get it easily, we can buy it. Buy it and cut it.

Shri Mataji: That's all right, but I just wanted to know if you know how to make it. In India how they make it I saw. What is the way they do it? If you can find out the secret. That's one of the factories we have to have in India. And also the fiberboard. The one it is called as fiberboard that you put all the fibrous things inside and have two wooden, what you call them, thin wood, like a panel and then press it together, called as plasterboard. No this is plasterboard and that's called as fiberboard.

Yogi: We have such production in Austria.

Shri Mataji: Yeah, but you'll have to find out how they do it. Thirdly, then the solar energy. Do you have any idea of solar energy?

Yogi: Yes, I was already asking an engineer how to do it and he gave me the exact measurements for the old project. How many solar panels we have to use, square meters, how to do it, the concept of it.

Shri Mataji: So you have solar projects?

Yogi: Yes, yes we have.

Shri Mataji: And it can be used for air-conditioning also, the same solar energy? You can cool the room.

Yogi: We have to produce electricity. The other way round, yes.

To produce electricity and use the air-condition.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: Yeah, I think so.

Shri Mataji: How can it be?

Yogi: With the solar energy.

Shri Mataji: Solar energy becomes electricity?

Yogi: Yes, that's coming from the...

Shri Mataji: Panels.

Yogi: Panels, and get the sunshine and comes the electricity out. We must do it. We must do it very well.

Yogi: That is too expensive.

Shri Mataji: You see but we have a lot of solar energy in our country. See, so many of these countries have solar energy and if you can convert it into air-conditioning it will be a better idea. Very expensive is it?

Yogi: Very expensive. We can use maybe the wind.

Yogi: The wind, Mother, is very good, is the wind.

Shri Mataji: Windmill. And what do they do with the windmill? They suck it.

Yogi: It turns a generator and gives electricity.

Shri Mataji: Oh I see, I see. It's one conversion of one into another.

Yogi: Solar energy to convert into electricity is very expensive but to convert into warm water it's easy, for example. The whole warm water supply, the heating could be done with solar energy.

Shri Mataji: I mean we have wind energy quite a lot. We have wind energy in India quite a lot. That can be utilized also.

Yogi: Here we can use, we can have it. Especially at the new land, I have seen we have here a strong north and a west wind. That is very good for to do such a thing. A couple of one or two kilometer distance is a wind, is there, it's already there. They have used the wind for.

Shri Mataji: It acts like a turbine. Yes, you see these things we have to think about because you see this money orientation, you see. It's so funny that see there's money like that, you see. Now, everything must go into money. Everything must become money. And then it goes from here to something else, so in this bringing this, making this available as money becomes expensive, so all this foreign exchange, this that all problems you see, everything goes to Switzerland and from there comes back. (Laughter) So it's a very wrong thing. So if you have to make a Barter system, a proper Barter system we should learn to use the energy of the same country and to convert it into something else. And I think when you have these also hydroelectric you can do very well in your country. Hydroelectric, because you have lots of waterfalls, and thing, such thing. But you don't need so much of energy now. You have produced lot of energy in your country.

Yogi: Where, in India, Mother or in Iran?

Shri Mataji: No, no, in your country.

Yogi: In Iran I haven't any idea what they are doing today. I try to forget my country.

Shri Mataji: But say in Austria you don't need any energy. But the life is so expensive.

Yogi: It is very expensive.

Shri Mataji: Extremely expensive, so to make it cheaper we must find out the ways and methods. I think the Barter system must be used. To use the Barter system somehow to send things which are made there say to countries which are making something else and let's make a Barter system. It's very expensive, I think. The way you were describing the other day I was surprized - the building cost.

Yogi: Yes. We are always surprised, when Guido is telling us how much he has spent for the house he built.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Yogi: When Guido told us the extension of the small house but this we cannot build one wall out of this. He builds a house. It's very expensive.

Shri Mataji: It's all machine, that's the trouble, everything goes into a machine business.

Yogi: Yes, Mother without machine you couldn't do, in the western country without machine you couldn't dare it.

Shri Mataji: No, but once you become machine you see what happens.

Yogi: The people is very, very-

Shri Mataji: It becomes expensive. Instead of becoming cheaper it becomes expensive. Because the labor becomes expensive. Everything becomes expensive with machine, nothing is cheaper. Wherever there are machines things are very expensive. So what's the use of having the machine, then?

I mean, I would say on the whole if you see Indians have lots of things with them, like they have got gold, they have got precious stones, and things with them in their houses, they have got brass, they have got silver, normally, but here nobody can have it because everything is machine. They have cottons you don't have, woolens you don't have, everything is artificial. You may have ten coats but all of them are artificial. Why not have two real coats?

Yogi: Mother, I have a suggestion. This is newly the people try to grow trees from tissue. What you think about it?

Shri Mataji: Tissues?

Yogi: Yes, from the Meristem that is the Kundalini from the trees. I want to try it. All the trees in Austria and Germany dying, and we couldn't reproduce it and that is only one way to produce a tree from the tissue, especially from Kundalini and I want to try it a couple of times.

Shri Mataji: If you give a bandhan to every tree it might develop into that way. If you give it a bandhan, you see.

Yogi: That is very easy.

Shri Mataji: You don't have to go round and round and round. Try that. (Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter)

Yogi: You all are going on the easy way and I try the difficult. We have got used to easy thing.

Shri Mataji: You don't want to eat this way, you want to eat this. (Laughter)

How is your Nabhi, is it all right now? (Laughter) I wanted you to write to Arun, you see. He writes to you, does he?

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: But he is very much spoiled. You see, he is very funny. You have to write to him what your culture has done to you. He wants you see his wife to be western cultured, he wants her to cut her hair, and to become, so stupid fellow, I tell you. He doesn't talk to her.

Yogi: Arun Goel.

Shri Mataji: Ha - he doesn't know what your culture has done to you. She is such a nice. She is a doctor.

Yogi: Who is it, Mother?

Shri Mataji: This Arun Goel, he is an architect. I can't believe it, and he has a left Nabhi problem, he had blood cancer, and I mean he ill-treats his wife like he doesn't talk to her at all. He wants her to cut her hair, and he wants her to be modern - shockingly. I think you better write to him.

Yogini: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: He is really making her so unhappy. It makes Me very hurt. You see, because I have married her to him. And such a nice girl. You see his wife? It's a very beautiful person. He says that we should have you see, he studied in a convent, he says so I am very convent oriented. I said it is nonsense all these convents are. You better write to him. He is a funny fellow I tell you. I told him if you ask maybe she will tell you all the dangers of this convent culture. Horrible. You had yourself a problem of a husband of that kind, and he is becoming the exactly the same style. You better write to him. He is absurd, absolutely absurd. She has very long hair so he cut her hair quite a lot. I said if she wants to cut your hair what do you think? Very aggressive like that and he keeps quiet, doesn't talk to her, doesn't smile, doesn't laugh. You are lucky I must say to marry Midha but this one is, I don't know who will marry him. That's why I wanted to talk to you. And he has a left Nabhi problem and she is a doctor. You see he had blood cancer you know and he was cured of blood cancer, he was dying. So I thought better to give him a wife who is a doctor. He is trying to show off. And I feel terrible because I think it's really injustice. He has not even registered the marriage so far. And better not if I again see if he is going to treat her like this I'll ask him to leave her and will marry her to somebody again.

All the children are upset. (Laughter) So we have to decide about Austria. I'm coming to Austria.

Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji. Yes please.

Shri Mataji: And I think we should move out of the cities. And go to the villages and get the people there.

Yogi: We're following already James' example, Shri Mataji. We have started already.

Shri Mataji: You are? Really? Good. And also you have to make that plan for Guido as I told you. That's an idea, isn't it?

Yogi: We will start tomorrow, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: So the thing that is in the upper level should look like a rustic thing and down below you can have cement if you want. That's quite four storeys you can't have with wood.

Yogi: I mean basically yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Yes, on the top storey we'll all have wood. Lower is all, we can use the same brick business for the pillars and things. That's a hot country also we have to think from that point of view. So if there is a nice inside a place for air to move it will be better, so you have a courtyard, it would be a better idea. But do it fast because they have to get it passed that's all. Even if you don't do that exactly the same you see doesn't matter it is Italy like India, (Laughter) it doesn't matter. They are not so particular about laws and things. The more particular they become the worst the countries, because they have no chances of producing anything nice, such a jammed thing. If you have too many laws you are just jammed into it. International law, national law, God knows all kinds of laws. (Shri Mataji laughing) Take you nowhere.

I'm very happy Austria is doing so well in Sahaja Yoga and I hope all of you will now create more Sahaja Yogis. And you are the people who can now publish about AIDS and things, where did we go wrong, why we make mistakes. Now they are saying preventive things. Now why have preventive things, why have it? What about our children? They will get it. So why do you want to have it. Why do you want to continue with this dirty culture? Why can't we change ourselves? Can't we lead a life of say sanity? You people can write like that. And it's quite an international thing.

Yogi: Some journalists they think already that it has been sent by God. So that they come back to a better life, so we should may be also emphasize a little bit on that.

Shri Mataji: Yes, you see sometimes a person say supposing you write an article. I told them the trick. You write an article saying why, what is this. Why not we think of our children, are they going to die like this. What is it what are we going to give them. Like that you talk. And then somebody else answers, a Sahaja Yogi saying that this is the answer. (Laughter &amp; applause) So we can trick them like that, you see and we can manage you see because the people are so stony there, you have to go from both the sides otherwise doesn't work out with them. (Shri Mataji laughing) You have to play tricks otherwise it doesn't work out.

Yogi: Mother, another question. Guido has told me I must give some trees for this new land. Have You desired which trees?

Shri Mataji: What trees?

Yogi: For this new land give a project and.

Shri Mataji: For him. What for?

Yogi: Not the building.

Yogi: He wants some suggestions from You, Shri Mataji.

Yogi: I want You give me every time. If You have a special desire I can do it.

Shri Mataji: You see it's such a vast land. Such a vast land, and I don't know what is in his mind is. But you see there they have two things I have seen is this roman pines they have here, it's very common plus the conifers are there, evergreens.

Yogi: At these places we have more oak trees already but they are not so healthy.

Shri Mataji: All right, you come and see the land and see for yourself.

Yogi: I have seen it.

Shri Mataji: Yes, and then you see for yourself what you would like to plant here. Because you see I have seen that everything cannot be planted. That's the trouble is. Yes, but you can have olives. Avocado.

Yogi: Avocado, papaya, mango.

Shri Mataji: All these things, Mango you can have?

Yogi: Litchi.

Shri Mataji: Litchis you can have.

Yogi: Mango is a little bit problem.

Shri Mataji: Mango is uncertain. Let's try some mangoes also, why not. (Laughter) With vibrations might be. (Laughter) Might survive.

Yogi: With your vibrations happens everything.

Shri Mataji: So we can have lots of, now in the house that I'm building, I'm putting all kinds of things there, whether they survive or not. We'll see whatever survives we'll have it. Avocado, I am going to put olives, everything in that house.

Yogi: Mother, the land is very good for bee, for honey. Yes, we can have there very good honey.

Shri Mataji: Honey.

Yogi: Is it good?

Shri Mataji: Very good. But you have to be careful with them.

Yogi: Yes, it is very far from here.

Shri Mataji: Yes it's all right. Then you have to have flowers.

Yogi: Yes, flowers are every time there.

Shri Mataji: If you have flowers then you can have honey also. But what is the best flower for honey?

Yogi: I think these Raps, this yellow one, and Acacia is very good. Acacia is the best one at this point.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that's what you should find out what is good for that. You should plant that. But I was thinking why not try some perfumes, from India. We can get mogra, we can get jasmine, champa, and then we can make perfume. It will be a better idea.

Yogi: No problem. It is a big land.

Shri Mataji: A very big land. Yes very big land. You're very lucky. (Shri Mataji laughing) But actually you see you must know that the land is going into prices very high. So I told them, "Make the ashram like a hotel so if we have to sell it we can sell it." Now I am talking of something else, just the opposite of what I have told you. Then with that money we can buy something else. Because, you see, we need not live in a very expensive land. We can use that for a better thing, better purpose. Just now I am thinking of making it into a hotel-like structure so that in case we have, because it's very expensive and we can sell it as a hotel very much, all right.

Yogi: Mother we can take our bees with us, we are going another land, we must have, here fifty, sixty persons in an ashram they need honey also.

Shri Mataji: No, no, why I was saying so that in that amount we can have four ashrams. So why not we have it, you see. In that amount we can have much more so. I mean, we don't want posh places or anything for ashram. That's what I was thinking for.

Yogi: And flowers we must have also.

Shri Mataji: Yes. I mean, you have to do a garden which is suitable for a hotel and walking paths and all that to begin with. Then we'll see about it later on. Or horses and things like that.

Yogi: Horses, is very good. They are crazy for horses.

Shri Mataji: That's it, so that people those who want to buy our hotel can do it, and we can shift from there and take another land which is more suitable for an ashram.

Yogi: I have heard if somebody holds here a new race of horse they can get money from government, may be we can try this new race. This is traditional horse which is pure race, pure Italian and the government gives all the funds to keep the race alive. So it's enough to have a stable and look after the horse.

Shri Mataji: We can make lots of stables there because the land, you see that is uneven you see what you can do is to put a stable six feet over the height or eight feet at the most so the ground could be made stables on top is the building you see coming up. So the what you call them supporting pillars can be used for the stables down below. So when you move it from there to there you see this is the house and actually you will have to raise some sort of pillars to put the house here, then again you come down again you come down like that. So underneath you can put all the horses also.

Yogi: I hope I haven't forgotten what I asked.

Shri Mataji: You have to come to India, also see My, this house that I am building and also to tell Me what should I grow there.

Yogi: Mother you told me. (Laughter) All right, Mother.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, may I thank you in the name of all the Austrian Sahaja Yogis for this fantastic weekend we were allowed to share with You and this all the other Sahaja Yogis. I think yesterday was the best bhajans for all of us since You gave us the opportunity to reduce our ego, our superego so we really could enjoy, there were no any obstacles. We really enjoyed and I think this was very wonderful. We thank You very much!

Shri Mataji: Yes that's really was very spontaneous. The whole thing worked out very spontaneously just on the phone he asked Me, I said, "Yes, I am coming." So it worked out like that - so fast. But what I feel about all the time is to go deep into it. Is that we do not go to the left or right, we go deep, you see. Like I was telling that you cannot make fun of God. You cannot make like Gregoire's book when I read it I was little surprised. Because you can't use God the way you can use other people, you cannot make fun. So what you have to do is to move in a very protocolish way towards God - is to be devoted, dedicated, venerated style, you see. It's an adoration which you must show with that idea that we are going towards God. It's God, you see, God is God. It cannot be compared with anyone. So it's a big chance you have. And know that you are very fortunate and that you are so lucky that you got such a nice chance to go towards God. So with that depth we should move and then you will be surprised that you'll grow very fast like a tree grows when it goes deeper, in the same way we have to go deeper and deeper into it. So the connection is very, very deep and sound.

May God bless you all from Austria! May God bless you!

Austria means Astra. Astra means the weapon, the weapon of God. So may God bless you!

Thank you very much!

Yogis: We thank you very much, Shri Mataji!

Shri Mataji: May God bless you all! May God bless you! Enjoy your work enjoy everything that you have. May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you!

She is very good. She has grown up so much, you see. I couldn't recognize. All the children are becoming big, big, big and I was thinking that now who is this one, then I realized.

Yogi: Shri Mataji Olivia is our best Laxmi which we have in Austria. She takes care so well about the babies and she likes it very much to do it. I must say, yes very nice.

Shri Mataji: She is like a grandmother.

May God bless you! May God bless you!

Happy to see you all here and enjoy and prosper in your own glory.

Yogis: Bolo Shri Dakshinamurthy Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi ki jay.

Shri Mataji: How did you come by lift so many? Now don't go too many.

Yogis: Now we walk. We walk.

Shri Mataji: You walk, its better. It's better to walk. Sometimes to walk up to God is a good idea. (Laughter)

Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji!

Shri Mataji: It's so nice to see you. I never expected but suddenly it happened I am very happy to see you all, very happy to see you all, the children so beautiful. May God bless you!

Yogini: Mother in two weeks of time I am going to Lebanon.

Shri Mataji: What?

Yogini: I am going to visit Lebanon in two weeks of time.

Shri Mataji: Lebanon.

Yogini: Yes, and You told me about two years ago that if I could organize a program there, [inaudible] place, You would be happy to come to Lebanon.

Shri Mataji: Yes, you see you better go over there. It's a good idea. We need people to go there and settle because I have no way of entering that country otherwise. All right, we have to work it out. Jai, jai, jai, jai - so sweet.

May God bless you! May God bless you all!

Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji!
