Conversation in Moscow (Russia), September 28th, 1995

So, can they marry twice, the Muslims, two times? Under law? In India, they can. You see, we have a Muslim law. And then if you say three times, "Talak, talak, talak", you can give divorce with so many children to provide. And they are kept on the streets.
So, you see, if the children of such families are there, you have to tell them about the common points. But they see the links, after, they see the links. They are to be told how the mother is to be respected, how the women to be respected because they are your mothers, they are your sisters, they are your daughters. So, naturally they will start changing. If you put these nice ideas into their head in childhood, tomorrow they will revolt their parents, revolt.

Bogdan: Shri Mataji, is there enough time left to make all these types of changes?
Shri Mataji: Very much there. You see, now what has happened is, you tell him that how a Sputnik works, he knows that. You see, first one container has all the containers. It goes up to a point and the first one explodes and there is acceleration. So, the second one then explodes. Then ultimately, it goes into space. So, in our development, we had first physical explosion, then emotional explosion, then emotional explosion, and then mental explosion. Now the last. Now the last. So, you are there, at the dawn.

What he is saying?
Bogdan: He says, yes, he is ready to run. He says, all the vibrations in him know.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Bogdan: His organism is telling him what you're saying is the truth.
Sahaja Yogini: Is the truth.
Shri Mataji: And this is the time. So fast! Now, see, Sahaja Yoga is spreading like fire.

I came to Russia first in what year?
Bogdan: 89, and 88 for the-
Shri Mataji: No, 89. From 89, till today say, [Shri Mataji makes a gesture meaning, it has spread]. Say, in such a short time, in a foreign country. This is a foreign country, in a way, for Me. I even don't know language. Also, don't know much history, except for [unclear]. You see, it just spread like that. The time is there.
Bogdan [translating]: We all walk under one God, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: That's it! That's it.
Bogdan [translating]: And there are no, there are no boundaries Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Thereâ€™s no more.
