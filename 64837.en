Conversation in Moscow (Russia), September 28th, 1995

1995-0928 Conversation with a Russian yogi from Muslim background, Moscow, Russia

During this meeting, Bogdan plays the role of the interpreter between Shri Mataji and the Russian yogi.

Shri Mataji: So, can they marry twice, the Muslims, two times? Under law? In India, they can. You see, we have a Muslim law. And then if you say three times “Talâq, talâq, talâq”, you can give divorce, with so many children to provide. And they are kept on the streets.

So, you see, if the children of such families are there, you have to tell them about the common points. But they see the links, after. They are to be told how the mother is to be respected, how the women are to be respected, because they are your mothers, they are your sisters, they are your daughters. So, naturally, they will start changing. If you put these nice ideas into their head in childhood, tomorrow they will revolt their parents, revolt.

Bogdan: Shri Mataji, is there enough time left to make all these types of changes?

Shri Mataji: Very much time. You see, now what has happened is, – you tell him –, that how a Sputnik works, he knows that. You see: first, one container has all the containers. It goes up to a point, and the first one explodes, and there is acceleration. So, the second one then explodes. Then ultimately, it goes into space. So, in our development, we had first physical explosion, then emotional explosion, and then mental explosion. Now the last. So, you are there, at the dawn.

What is he saying?

Bogdan: He says, yes, he is ready to run. He says, all the vibrations in him know that.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Bogdan: His organism is telling him what you’re saying is the Truth.

Sahaja Yogini: It’s the Truth.

Shri Mataji: And this is the time. So fast! Now, see, Sahaja Yoga is spreading like that.

I came to Russia first in what year?

Bogdan: 89; 88 for the...

Shri Mataji: No, 89. From 89 till today [Shri Mataji makes a gesture meaning that it has spread]. Say, in such a short time, in a foreign country. This is a foreign country, in a way, for Me. I even don’t know the language. Also, I don’t know much of history, except for Lenin. You see, it has just spread like that. The time is there.

Bogdan: We all walk under one God, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: That’s it! That’s it.

Bogdan: And there are no, there are no boundaries, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: There’s no more.

Bogdan: The language is not a barrier, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Russian people have to do it. It has worked out very well, more than in America. It’s a time and a place. And these children... so many great children are born in this country. Because it’s a better country to be born in. Even in my country I must say; but you know that in India the white skin people have minus growth.

Bogdan: It is called the demographic crisis.

Shri Mataji: Ah! Everywhere! Why, why? Because they don’t know want to be born. They’ll be born in Russia, they’ll be born in India, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia.

Bogdan: And then in Ukraine, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Also. Russia and Ukraine, I consider as one country. For me, they are not two countries, no.

Bogdan: What he is asking about, Shri Mataji, is about the time. He worries about the time because now there are many rumours and many signs from different people that the time of the populous is here, the time of catastrophe you might say, when everything is supposed to be whether ruined or go further, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Both ways. You see, if the goodness will come up and if people don’t accept it, it will destroy all that is negative.

Bogdan: He is asking: people who are now guided towards spirituality and are lifted up, they will be left and the others will be destroyed or what, Shri Mataji? He is asking...

Shri Mataji laughs.

Shri Mataji: Actually, I don’t know what to do because in the hell also, there is not much room.

Laughter

Shri Mataji: They will be hanging the lean boys. Don’t worry about this. They don’t deserve to be in the Kingdom of God. They are dishonest; they have no compassion, no love, violent. And even if they are criminals, they can change, but if they don’t want to change... Then Mr. Chirac, now. Where are we going to put him?

(Laughter)

But in politics, they don’t understand what Truth is, that in politics you don’t have to earn money. Not at all, because if you earn money your reputation goes down; but you have to earn value. That’s why; like Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, all of them. You see, I’ll give him the book about Lal Bahadur Shastri, another fellow, who died here in Tashkent. My husband was his official secretary. You see, he was a realised soul; he lived there in Tashkent, where he died. So, I forced my husband [UNCLEAR/to meet him?] to write this book. You see, my husband has worked so hard, he was ultimately secretary-general of this UN agency. He was selected by 138 countries. He has so many awards. But now he says only after writing this book he’s got fame. Files after files, out of nowhere. So I will give him the book.

Aleksander Garoshka: Spassiba.

Shri Mataji: A very good book.

Aleksander Garoshka: Spassiba.

Shri Mataji: Very nice meeting! What is his name?

Bogdan: Aleksander Garoshka.

Shri Mataji: Garoshka, it’s the name. First name?

Bogdan: Aleksander.

Shri Mataji: Aleksander. So, all Aleksanders are great! He came to India and married an Indian lady.

Bogdan: History is nice. He likes history, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: And then, when he saw the Indians as they were, he came back and he said “I can’t live here”.

Bogdan (translating a question asked by the yogini): Shri Mataji, he is a little worried about the fact: is the rising Kundalini dangerous?

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR: Not a whit]

Bogdan: There are writings; he reads a book [UNCLEAR: The Secrets...].

Shri Mataji: Ah, I know, I know! You see, why [UNCLEAR: did he write this headache]? Because he didn’t want you to get the Truth. This fellow Gopi Krishna, his private life was so dirty. And he’s just said better to say against the Kundalini, so that people don’t take to Truth and they can have money.

It is your Mother, your own Mother, individual Mother, and She has to give you your second birth. And She knows everything about you; it’s like a tape-recorder. How can She harm him? When you were born, your mother took all the labour pains upon herself. How can She harm you?

They don’t know anything, they don’t know anything; they are horrible, horrible.

Bogdan: But he read this from some Indian authors, books by Indian authors.

Shri Mataji: Gopi Krishna! So many! They are all... you can call them criminals. And they are very bad in character.

I show you...

(Shri Mataji takes a leaflet from the table)

This is the Mooladhara, – this one is different, you see – which is at the base.

Now, this is responsible for all our excretions, inclusive of sex. The Kundalini crosses all the six centres; and this centre is kept not in the process. And here is the Kundalini, in the sacrum; and the Greeks knew about it, as they called it sacred bone. Now, you see what happens, this is the path of Kundalini. When they try to raise the Kundalini from the sexual parts, then this, which is Shri Ganesha, is Innocence, then He gets angry and He passes heat all over.

So, one should know that in the awakening of Kundalini, you should not disturb this. Actually, when Kundalini rises, all your excretions stop, every time. Sometimes, we have programs for nine hours, and I don’t go to the bathroom, and no people go, none of them; because you see this stops all activity. Because it is Innocence. Christ has said: “you have to be like children to enter in the Kingdom of God”. Very innocent.

They use sex. That’s why. The wrong way. It is insulting your Mother. And Her chastity.

He (Shri Ganesh) looks after the chastity of these parts.

(Shri Mataji leafs through the leaflet) You see it is very interesting what they have done here; very [UNCLEAR]. But ultimately, you see, this (Mooladhara chakra) becomes this (Agnya chakra).

I said that Christ – because Ganesha has never incarnated; He is the Eternal child –... so now, Shri Ganesha incarnates as Christ, Innocence. Everything can be proved. I told them that this chakra is made of carbon. It has four valencies. This carbon atom, I asked them to take photography. There were a lot of scientists. If you see this atom from the right side, you see a Swastika; if you see it from left to right, it is Omkara; if you see it from down upwards then you see Alpha and Omega. Christ said I’m the Alpha and Omega. The proof is here. But another proof...

(Shri Mataji asks another yogi the name of a scientist)

Yogi: Doctor Khan.

Shri Mataji: Doctor Khan. We brought a scientist here who had told them that all these centres have their peethas here (Shri Mataji touches Her own Sahasrara). (Then, addressing Bogdan): So, you tell him what happens now.

Bogdan (this part is translated from Russian/21:16-22:50): It was surprising when the scientists from Novosibirsk (Russian city in Siberia) measured the increase of theta waves during meditation. They did an encephalogram, after they scanned. The scientist asked to put attention on this chakra (Bodgan points to the Vishuddhi chakra), and the biggest change occured at this point (Bodgan points to the peetha of the Vishuddhi chakra on the head). And then here (Bodgan shows the Nabhi and its right and left peethas on the head). Mother told us about it 10 years ago. When the attention was on the heart chakra, the biggest change occurred here in the centre of the fontanelle area. Now we’ve got a proof of what Mother told us a long time ago, 10-15 years ago, by Russian scientists.

Aleksander Garoshka: Does the heart chakra open Sahasrara?

Bogdan: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: Sahasrara, yes. That’s the peetha (putting Her hand on Sahasrara). That’s the peetha.

Bogdan:  It’s like a master chakra [UNCLEAR] 10-15 years ago. (Addressing to Shri Mataji) Jay Shri Mataji!

Shri Mataji: This I told you how they found out.

Bogdan: We had our diagrams and schemas and now there is a scientific proof of this.

Aleksander Garoshka: Scientific proof.

Bogdan: This is very interesting.

Shri Mataji (showing a book): This is the book for the children I read. (Showing a picture inside the book)There are all here. So, I want to give you...

Bogdan (translating): Your smile is very similar to a child’s smile, Shri Mataji!

Shri Mataji: Now, what I’m saying is that I want to give you this book and you can see just the essence.

(Aleksander Garoshka gives a pen to Shri Mataji who writes a dedication before handing the book to him)

Aleksander Garoshka: Spassiba bolchoïé.

Shri Mataji: This is the school. (Giving back the pen) Thank you.

Aleksander Garoshka: Spassiba bolchoïé.

Shri Mataji: What did he say?

Bogdan (translating): Thank you very very much, Mother.

He says that the Himalayas, they are not a simple thing, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: No, no, they are not. They are the Sahasrara.

Bogdan: For a very long time, he was organizing in tourism. He was a guide, with a sack on, and just guided for camping, tourists, and led them to nature. And with children he walked and tramped through about every hill area in the Soviet Union. He went to the Pamir Hills, in the Soviet side, which is quite near to The Himalayas, still in the Soviet Union. But he hasn’t come yet to The Himalayas.

Shri Mataji: You will come and also I will buy land for all of you on another side, near the lake you see.

Yogi (Mahajan) has another job.

Yogi Mahajan (laughing): Shri Mataji...

Aleksander Garoshka: Spassiba bolchoïé.

Bogdan: He was very very glad to meet you Shri Mataji; thank you very much.

Shri Mataji: Thank you. May God bless you.

Bogdan: He feels that he has learnt very much from Your talk, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: And we’ll send him some more books to read.

Aleksander Garoshka: Spassiba.

Shri Mataji: Because he understands English.

Bogdan: A little bit, Shri Mataji, he said.

Shri Mataji: No, quite a lot.

(Shri Mataji gives a card to Aleksander)

Aleksander Garoshka: Spassiba.

Shri Mataji (addressing the yogini): Where is his card?

(Aleksander gives his card to Shri Mataji)

Shri Mataji: All right. (Addressing the yogini) So should we ask him to [UNCLEAR].

(Shaking hands with Aleksander): Very nice to meet you; very nice, very nice! And I wish you all the best for the development of children.

Aleksander Garoshka: Spassiba.

Bogdan (translating): And Russia, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Russia and children; also Russia, of course, of course.

Aleksander Garoshka: Spassiba.

Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you. He is a patriot. May God bless you. Thank you very much, thank you.
