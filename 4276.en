Talk to Sahaja Yogis, with questions/answers. St.Martin’s Lane, London (UK),  8 April 1987.

[aside] ... I'd have some water, perhaps. ... and bring My purse.
I'm watching all the beauty. You looked so beautiful at the airport. Such a joy for Me to see you in that shape. It's a rare occasion sometimes that you feel oneness with the whole universe, absolutely oneness with the whole universe when you feel the love that exists within all of you. It's the love within you, the oneness within you the way you open your heart to each other as good human beings, as realised souls, as saints. It is the most fulfilling and satisfying thing for Me.
When a saint used to meet another saint, say in India, what would happen? There was a saint in Maharashtra that was a tailor, but he was a saint. Saint is a saint, whether he is a tailor or anything. And there was another saint who was a potter who used to make pots and all that out of clay. So this saint, Namadeva, went to see this potter who was making some pots out of clay. And he looked at him and the feeling that came into his heart is expressed - he was a great poet, Namadeva. So he says in Marathi, I'm translating this in English, "I came here to see the Chaitanya, the formless, but the formless is standing before me in the form." So to appreciate the other saint he said, "Now the whole Chaitanya, the whole All-pervading power of God's love has come in your form before me, I see it." How to address, just think of it. At that moment, spontaneously he said this. 
That is how you're all saints and saints have to see that you are the form of that love of God's all-pervading power. You are in the form of that, all of you. I think they're understanding it, in a way mislead with all their children. For a Mother is too much to see such beautiful feelings for Me. But the feelings among yourselves, the open heartedness, the pure love that fill the whole atmosphere with such beauty it's not just talking, it's not just writing letters or sending birthdays cards or something like that. It's from the heart. You have to feel each other that you are all saints. You are different people, you have to support each other. You have to look after each other, you have to understand each other because you are people of different awareness, living among people who are blind, who can hate you; they can do some harm to you. 
The other day I was reading Gyaneshwara. Can you imagine, he died at the age of twenty three years, at such a young age as 23 years. And the "Gyanseshwari" he wrote at the age of 21 years. And what a genius! I mean, if you read it... I cannot just understand how he could penetrate so deep. He described you all. As I have told you many times, he described you all as the oceans, the walking oceans of Ambrose, ambrosia; talking trees and the forest of the trees of bliss and beauty; that wherever you'll go, you'll bless people, wherever you stand, you'll be auspicious, you'll create harmony, peace and joy. 
That's you are what, that's your style, that's what you are here for. But beware, be very careful because the surroundings seem to be quite deceptive and quite troublesome. And from that surrounding you are coming out suddenly into a new surrounding where you are not known what is Divine love, what is Divinity. One has to be very careful because the forces that are negative are very strong and are working on you all the time. Because you've come from matter, you are evolved form matter and it's easy to go to matter, to materialism, to the materialistic ideas. And this materialism takes you to primitiveness. All you culture, all your beauty will drop off as soon as you take to materialism. If everything becomes money, there is no place for God, no place for love, no place for beauty or for any graciousness. Money is for us, we are not for the money. Money should get our command. We don't have to give everything for that. And here then we see the materialism coming up in a very different way, in very subtle ways and we do not see it. When we start saying 'mine, mine; this is mine', then you're slowly drifted to materialism. When you see yourself in the collective, that's the only way you can get out of materialism, because you are in reality a collective being, you are not an individual that way. But the matter divides you from each other. And when you realise that we are not slaves of matter - matter is our slave, we are not going to be dominated by any matter - then you can feel that love. One goes to absurd limits if you take to materialism. And everything can be explained in the name of materialism.
But in the name of Divine how far you can go and explain? You have to just enjoy it. When you enjoy it, you don't want to explain or talk about it, you want just to enjoy. Divinity is to be enjoyed, within and without. It is within you, Divinity is within you. But it is to be enjoyed. That's only possible if you understand that you are not going to be dominated by any matter, whatever.
I'm very sorry I'm here for such a short time. I wish I could be with you forever, which I am, I think. But you are brothers and sisters everywhere. The whole world has this message with them. Some of you have met them in India, all Indians have send their love to you, lots of love. I mean they don't know what to send you from there. Something special? So they sent Me. (applause) Sometimes I feel all of us should be somewhere, all of us from all over the world, from every corner of the world. All great saints who are in these modern times should meet each other, talk to each other, enjoy each other and understand each other. That's the time we'll think that a new era has started of love, of trust, of enjoyment of other human being. When you start enjoying another person, then only we can say that that you are in the collective. Like My finger, if it pains, another one will try to sooth it and I feel the soothing without feeling any gratitude or without feeling any sort of obligation. So always I say about collectivity. Those cannot be collective, those who cannot open their hearts, those who keep aloof, those who think - some of the might be thinking "O, we are great Sahaja Yogis because we are very old Sahaja Yogis", some might be thinking "O, we are very intelligent", some that "We are rich, poor" and all that - all these differences should disappear. 
Who is crying? She is crying? What's the matter? [an yogi explains something and Shri Mataji laughs] One day they all will grow up. I was thinking that when they grow up, they will clap much more than you do. [yogis laugh] Little more time we need. Somehow all these great people will be becoming great Sahaja Yogis and will give us such a pleasure, such a joy, such a happiness. 
Today I wanted to speak about something but I've just put it as a question to you all. And I'd like to have an answer from you. You can write to Me, or let see, or you can discuss it. That has formally, as other saints have said, that once you get your Realisation you are lost, you can't speak about it. You can just tell them only some nice words, metaphors, this that, but you can't give them really the experience by telling them. And that's why many saints decided that after Realisation it's better to disappear. Even Gyanseshwara took his samadhi, hewent into a room and died in that room. Because they could not say much about it, they could not tell much about it. 
But today is not the situation. Like Kabira has said that when a drop becomes the ocean, what can you say? You are lost, you are no more there, you are all finished. So, what is happening in Sahaja Yoga, today’s Sahaja Yoga, that we are all talking about it, we experience it and enjoy it. That's the question to all the Sahaja Yogis to solve. 
You can explain? Did you hear My question? No? Did you hear My question? See, what I said it was that formally those people who got Realisation, got lost, perhaps as you are lost just now in thoughtless awareness. But you can come back and you can tell people, you can talk about it. And many people disappeared. Actually they didn't want to leave after getting Realisation for long time because they could not explain, talk to people about it. Also they said that how a person who has no tongue could tell about the taste of the jaggery or a kind of a seed. So there was a problem with them, all of them had a problem. But now you don't have that problem.
So, what is happening in Sahaja Yoga that you have no problem? Think it over and write to Me, alright? So I don't know what to say anymore. Just you are enjoying our rapport with each other, isn't it?
Is anybody having any questions? Anybody who is a new person can ask the question. It is a good idea. Because these people have no questions now. Ask it now.
[Question from the audience, unclear.]
Shri Mataji: How can we...? What?
Now you see, you'll meet three types of new people. Firstly, those who are yogis or we can call them as people of previous birth, who are very knowledgeable and are there. Just they can feel it, this is it. You won't have much problem with them, they know it is. To them it's very obvious. You'll be amazed the way they are there, how they've taken to it so easily.
Now, the second type of the people who maybe still believing or not believing, maybe some who are doubting, maybe, or maybe some who are asking questions about it, quite a lot. 
So it is not sufficient only for you to get your Realisation. Also not sufficient for you that you feel the vibrations and that you can give Realisation to other; that won't help much. You have to know how to deal with various types of people. Like I would say, a person who, say, is a priest, who comes to you and wants to talk to you about God, this that. So you must know Bible very well and know Bible in the way a Sahaja Yogi should know. 
The other day Rustam telephoned to tell to Me that I told him to study Koran. Because, I said, Islam means 'surrender' but before Realisation surrender has no meaning. And he told Me that it's written in Koran that unless and until you are connected with God, you cannot understand anything what is written there. Clearly said. Now, when the Muslims talk to you, you can say them that this is written in Koran, 'Are you connected with God'? Now, they might say 'Are you connected?' Then if you say 'yes', then finished. [yogis laughing] Then Mr. Ego will come up, you see, suddenly. And you be careful. So this subject should be treated with the barge pole.
Like such a question if they ask, this is there will be that 'Are you that?' Like in the beginning they used to ask Me 'What’s your father? What's your mother? Who are you?', this that, all those things. So at that time you have to give an answer to that. 
[aside] Can you give this lady a chair to sit down? 
So, such a question if you are answering that manner, you've not been clever enough. You have to be very clever. Then you should say, 'You see, there are...' Avoid the subject, don't answer it. Just say, 'You see, there are descriptions about the person who is a realised soul. Jung has said that you have to become collectively conscious.' 
Now what is collectively conscious? That is on your central nervous system you should be able to feel another person. Now Jung has said so, it's a quote. Then you have to have other people to quote. William Blake you can quote, you can quote other poets or saints whom you know, depends on what sort of a person you are dealing with. But just don't say 'Yes, I'm a realised soul.' People have been crucified, murdered, poisoned for saying that. So be careful. Put it on somebody else and say 'Yes, the signs of a realised soul are like this, that he has to be collectively conscious.' 
First of all, that you have read Jung or you know much about collective consciousness itself will put them right, in their own places, to begin with. Because you have to be knowledgeable in these modern times and you should be able to communicate. Just by telling them that 'I'm a realized souls, I have to awaken your Kundalini.' nobody will believe it. Even in India people don't believe that we can give Realisation, although they know about Realisation, they know about Kundalini, they know everything. Bust still they cannot believe that we like ordinary people can give Realisation to them. So in no way you should be diffident, but try to bring them round to somebody else. Because the human nature is such the one who is living, the one who is existing they don't want to accept. Whosever is dead and has written anything in black and white, or if you say in this book this and this is written, they will accept it. That's why you have to be knowledgeable, you must read books which are supportive of your Realisation, supportive of Sahaja Yoga. Then only you can talk to them. If you are just having Realisation, you can give Realisation, you've got vibrations, that won't work out, specially in the western countries where people are too much here [Shri Mataji puts Her hand on the head, nothing there [She puts hand on the heart]. You have to tell them that 'We are also intelligent enough and we also understand it with our brains and logic what is the truth is.' Then after their Realisation, of course it's much easier, but if you say 'Alright, come along, I have to give you Realisation', you cannot.  
You cannot force them, you can not; they have to ask for it. After all there is protocol of the Divine also, that Divine cannot fall at the feet of people 'Oh, please come and have your Realisation'. That's too much. But there are ways and ways by which you can ask people and work it out. But I must tell you one thing, that all the Sahaja Yogis before they started Sahaja Yoga and in the West specially, and in England also, you see, whenever I talk to them they are very anxious how to get more people into Sahaja Yoga, how to bring more people, what to do for more people, how to manage. Or they would think somebody to be very spiritual or something, so 'Mother, can I bring that fellow?' and it turned out to be a horrid stuff, you see. It would burns My hands, it would burn everything. And I'd say 'How do you mean? What made you think that he is spiritual?' And 'Mother, he talks so much of spirituality.' It's not the thing. 
It is a caliber, it's an inner caliber the person must have. He may be an ordinary person, he may not be earning so much money, he might be on the street, but inner caliber has to be there. Otherwise what's the use of breaking your head against the wall? 
So this idea of having more and more (people - transcriber's note) is wrong. But to have people who are of that caliber, of that quality and who deserve it. So many do not deserve it. So what to do? You cannot just... It is not like a barbershop that you can make the headdress the way you like. The Sahasrara has to open out! You see, the Kundalini has to come out. It has to work that way! You cannot just say 'Alright, now you've got Realisation.', you can't say that. All the time the Kundalini is falling down, so you should say 'Sorry, sir, I'm sorry.', finished. And the more you show as if you are seeking elections for the lords, the more then be worst. If somebody doesn't get Realisation, well and good. 
For example, a lady met Me in a plane and she said 'I want to have Realisation'. 'Alright. I would try.' Then she wrote three letters to Me, sent photographs of she. Then she said 'I don't know why you don't write to me. I've been writing to you, this and that. I know it's a difficult task to give a Realisation'. So I told her 'Alright, when I'm back next in June, then come along.' But there could be somebody who might be of that caliber, you can feel it. You are knowledgeable yourselves, you can feel the vibrations, you can feel it and you can then take that person seriously. 
So work on the people who are simple, who have that caliber. Of course, they could be very much spoiled also because of seeking, but if their intent is sincere, then best thing is to work it out with complete assiduity and attention to such a person. 
But if it's a fashion, you see, because they are going to many gurus and they were doing lots of guru-shopping, then you should say 'There is no shopping. You can't pay. First of all you can't pay.' If they understand that, then it's alright. Like one fellow from BBC who came to Me and he said 'We can't believe in a guru who doesn't take any money.' I said 'Then alright, you go to such a guru, he takes money for nothing. I'm not interested.' He said 'But actually there is an Anglo-Saxon brain' - I don't know what's is that brain specially, made by God or not? - 'can't understand anyone who can do such a thing without money.' Such a person you should say 'Alright, thank you very much, I'm sorry. You see, you are beyond me or too great, sorry.'  Not hurting the person; but such ideas, such things if they have in their brains, you cannot break such a hard nut, can you? And you should not feel sorry for that. But see their vibrations, see their caliber.
Caliber is the only way you can judge how much attention used to go to him, what is to be done. For some people it's so obvious, so obvious. And some people go on arguing, arguing with you. But all of them now are good Sahaja Yogis, despite the bad Agnya and arguing with Me quite a lot, to begin with. They are now very good Sahaja Yogis. But now time has come that you have to have quick result. And you'll meet people who will be very good, I'm sure you'll meet all of them who are now in England and you'll be able to manage them. Your ways, your methods, your styles will come easier. 
Today only Dr Brian told Me that western people are getting interested now in Sahaja Yoga because they can the change that comes in, the transformation, the confidence, everything that this is. So you should not try to force Sahaja Yoga on anyone. It's better that you see their caliber. Caliber is very easy to make out. You just say that it is there, I know. Any other question?
[lady asking some question from a distance]
Shri Mataji: I can't hear, what is it?
Yogi: If a person has a problem and a Sahaja Yogi...
Shri Mataji: Now, sympathy and compassion. Sympathy if doesn't get involved, then it's compassion. 'Sym-pathy', 'sym' means share, 'pathy' means pathos. If you want to share the pathos of another person, then you are sympathizing with that person. Now supposing somebody's husband is dead and that person is crying a lot, and you go and sit down and cry louder than her. Then people will ask 'Did you husband die or her husband?' [audience laughing] 'No, no, I'm just showing sympathy, you know.' This is lip-sympathy, of course. 
Another one is maybe the heartfelt-sit/sip. When it is heart-felt, then you don't cry, then you develop the opposite force to put that person right. What do you say to that person? You should say, 'See, now if you are born then you are going to die, everybody is going to die; that's the system. Now two persons never die together. This gentleman who has died is your husband, alright. But now if you start crying like this, he won't have any peace. He'll be hovering around you and he might be in limbo waiting for you to come there.' Or something like that. So no use crying over him. On the contrary, you should say 'I'm alright, don't worry about me. I'm alright. Get your Realisation as I've got it.' This is the opposite force that you put. This is the real way of helping that person.
But the compassion is very different. Compassion just flows, it doesn't say anything. Even if you don't see Me, even if you're in the hospital, you know I'm with you. It works. Even if you just think of Me, it works. Even if you know some mistakes, you know Mother is forgiving. That's compassion. Compassion is just flow, it doesn't talk, it doesn't say anything; it just flows and covers you completely. And you enjoy that. That's compassion. It works; sympathy doesn't work. Compassion works, it sooths you. It's a very beautiful touch of love, affection, kindness, protection. And you feel so confident that you are under the protection of the Divine. So this compassion has not to be shown or dealt with.
Now, supposing another Sahaja Yogis is having a problem. We have only two problems. As I say how many turns there are in London - only two, left and right. In the say way we have only two problems - whether left or right. If it is a left one, or the right one. You know, the right you should beat with the shoes, that's all - finished. You don't have to go and say anything to the person, if he has right problems. Now, if he has the left problem, what do you do? You need not to go and talk to that person, you can give a bandhan, you can burn the name, you can go and do what you like. And you need not to face the person, you need not to tell the person that 'I am helping you, I'm trying to do something for you.' That's wrong, that's ignorance. You don't have to say that. It just works, it has to work by itself. I don't tell you that I'm going to help you in any way, do I? Nothing of the kind. Wherever you are, you know I'm with you, all the time. In the same way, this compassion will work whether you sit here or you're beating somebody with shoes so that person comes round. 
So there are only two problems - one in the left, or the right. If you try to sympathise with anyone of them, you are in trouble. So best thing is not directly to help them, but indirectly. Not to tell them that you are helping them, not even mention it to them. The concern is the point, the concern about the person. Your attention should go there, your attention is very active, it's a very powerful thing you have got. Your attention acts. Just put your attention to that person, with a concern but no involvement. That is compassion. You have got it, you've got the power of compassion in your attention now. You have to use it, without taking any credit for it, without showing it, without confronting it. Just inside yourselves you feel it, then it'll work. 
And for that you have to cleanse your own attention, that's very much. If your attention is loose type, if your connection is not alright, then it won't work out. But if you have that kind of an attention which is silent, which is witnessing, which is not involved, it's dynamic, it works. All of you have to become like Me, I'm sure you all can, and achieve that caliber of compassion. Alright? You follow now? Thank you. 
Any other question has there? No? Danya, you have any questions? You never had them. Anybody else? Jason? None? Questions less people I have heard.
Best way is to enjoy others. That's way to enjoy yourselves. And to enjoy yourselves, is to laugh to yourselves, that's the best way. Address yourselves, 'You, Mister, now come along. This is ego, I know... [yogis laugh] That's the one... No, no, not me. I have enough of you.' That's how you enjoy yourselves. And enjoy other seeing their good points. Sweet, sweet things, very sweet things. You don't have to say anything.
We had 71 marriages, can you believe it? Then I looked at the brides and they were looking at Me from the angles and their eyes were telling the story of their love, and gratitude. And I don't know what all is to be said. I was just watching them when they were walking with their garlands in their hands slowly, slowly... the sweetness, the beauty of their feelings... Very slowly they were walking and then I saw the boys standing there, looking at Me with tremendous feeling of oneness. You see, this cannot be enjoyed otherwise. Even with the body you cannot enjoy. Supposing you're rubbing you hand, you cannot enjoy it as you enjoy other people, other Sahaja Yogis. And then friend's leg pulling we enjoy. The way they talk I enjoy. Everything is so enjoyable. That doesn't hurt anyone, doesn't trouble anyone; you are here to enjoy. God has created this universe for you to enjoy. 
So only thing is that you must improve your attention. Cleanse your attention by meditation, always thing of good things, not of bad things. You don't have to react too much, just be within yourself. See for yourselves, witness everything and you'll be amazed, you'll see beautiful points, beautiful things all around. So much of beauty which we are loosing because we cannot see it. 
So (with) that deep penetrating attention of concern you'll solve all the problems, I'm sure. But 'open your heart' doesn’t mean that you go and hug somebody and kiss somebody ten times. Doesn't mean that at all; on the contrary, it could be quite embarrassing, you know. 
Any other questions?  
I had a problem there, you see. We were arranging for Me a program to speak to the Young Presidents Organization, the presidents of big, big organizations, business organizations. And I had to speak to them, and one of the ladies, of course I mean the questions were very good and everything was feeling over, when she throws away 'But I can't believe it because she is not at all serious' [yogis laugh] And I laughed and laughed and laughed with this, and now I can't be serious anymore also. [Mother and yogis laugh] When there is joy bubbling out, how can you be serious? That is the idea of a saint that you should be very serious, stern, going out with the stick in your hands all the time, hitting everyone on the head. [Shri Mataji laughs] Any other questions by now? No? 
You should have a hall here with all, you should buy somewhere. You should be able to buy. I'm thankful to people who are working on Shuddy Camp but I think we must hurry up now. People are coming for Guru Puja, I've told them we have it in Shuddy Camp. And otherwise if it is not ready, we have to change the venue. So everybody has to go and work it out, that’s what is important. We have money, we have no problem on that. You have to have a nice, grand, beautiful seminar before Guru Puja. And there are many coming here and you meet all of them, and have a very nice time; real festival will be arranged.    
So it would be better that all of you combine and work it together, work it out and also give different work to different people, and they should all try to organise it in a beautiful way, (so) that there's no quarrel, nothing. But you'll see, you people will say, 'O, this is the room I would like to have for my wife.' - things like that; sounds stupidity - 'This is the glass for me, so I can't give it to you'. All such stupid things will be there and I think for such people you should say 'You are not for Guru Puja, better don't be there.' Everybody doesn't deserve to be there. That's what we should find you, that what sort of people they are. If they're fighting for all these little, little things, it's better that you tell them 'Sorry, it's better that you don't come for Guru Puja.' 
So, the most important thing is that in Guru Puja we have to receive a special capacity to be Gurus ourselves, a special intelligence, a special understanding, a kind of a wisdom which gives you discretion and the ability to argue out things. That will enhance your personality. A beautiful, dignified personality can be created within yourselves. So for that you have to be there with all that dedication and understanding about yourselves. 
So I'm looking forward to this Guru Puja. Everybody has to write now, for Sahasrara day they are working so hard. The people form Australia have printed so many posters, all over the world they've sent it, they have sent it to you also. The posters of Sahasrara they haven't brought? No? I've shown them. So next time I'll show all of them. They should see what they've done, how much... You must...
And we don't know anything like news from there, but this all can be discussed among yourselves and you should know about each other, what is happening where and what is the ashram doing, what is the special work that they are doing and what is the new thing they've discovered. All sort of of things you can find out from each other and you can tell others also. This is how you are keeping communication with each other. Or there is a very good news that Dr. (Umesh -tr.n.) Rai who is the Dean of the Faculty of Physiology in Delhi University started a research work on the comparative study of Sahaja Yogis and others, as far as physiology is concerned. And he found out that the people who are not Sahaja Yogis have a very low resistance for diseases, their skin resistance is so... So many things he found out. I mean, he has put it in, he has tabulated the whole thing and that is been now approved by the government and it is now published, it's going to be published also.      
In the same way, you see, we are thinking of having the research here done for people in Shuddy Camp, so that we can also publish something like that with the research. That so far, you see, so many have been cured, so many have got rid of their addictions, so many have got rid of their mental problems, so many thing happened but we haven't yet recorded it, we have not put it properly on the record. Now this is what we are going to do now. Anybody who has achieved something or has felt better or has been cured or something like that must give it in writing to these people so they record it. Because, you see, in these modern times they want everything in black and white. That could be done very well here in England. 
Another thing I was thinking that now 'Nirmala Yoga' has stopped there because of this problem of foreign exchange. So what we can do is to have 'Nirmala Yoga' published in India and send here, and you can print it here and sell it here, so that the foreign exchange problem doesn’t come in. Foreign exchange is such a problem in that country, you have to have a proper committee, this that, all headaches. So you can sell them here. [inaudible] It's very easy, bulk can be done for our countries. Yes, that's all. We get 'Nirmala Yoga' done there and just a copy sent here, translated. You can also add things, you can also put something into it, and some things form there and some things form here. You can distribute it to all the centres here and we can start like that. Because they've created a big problem out of the last 'Nirmala Yoga' so I just stopped. Because, you see, we are not very good at human laws, I think. Sometimes you make mistakes and I don't want you people to be caught up in those human laws. So you have to be careful. And we can do it, I think we can do it. 
And as England is the Hear it has to circulate everything. But the heart hasn't opened out, the conditioning is very bad here. You see, that you are told that you should not express your feeling, you should not say anything, you should be very poised, you should not talk about your feeling. That's not so in Sahaja Yoga. You see, this is the heart and the heart must beet, heart must say. You must know how to say that you love others. It's very easy to say 'I hate', but it's very difficult for people to say 'I love you'. Because they're afraid, they fear that if you commit like this - 'Oh, you love me? So do this fobbing. You love me? So do this fobbing. [yogis laugh] How dare you say you love me? If you love me, you must do this and you must give this.' 
Now, we had some Sahaja Yogis like that. They were abusing Me also that 'You said You love us. Why don't You do this for us?' Then it becomes a demanding now. 
Any other question anywhere? What's happening, John, about your 'priesthood'? [Shri Mataji laughs] They are getting quite exposed. Exposure is the only way but still nothing goes to heads of the people. They are so egoistical, nobody wants to accept that is all exposed now within - 'No, now this is fanaticism, this is nonsense'. But still they go on, it's impossible.  
[children cry] Beautiful children we have here. 
How many are new people? Who is sitting/singing for the first time? Raise your hands, please. Aha?! You are looking little, little serious. [yogis laugh] Still rather serious. You shouldn't be serious at all. Good, nice. 
[baby cries] Little children... He is just hitting the head. Who is the child crying there so much? Whose child? [to someone] What is the matter? He must be hot, take out the sweater. I think it must be hot for the child. And they feel very thirsty, also. When in places where you don't have humidity much, so they feel very thirsty when you take them to such places, I think. All of them try the same, whether they are Indian, English, anything. From their crying you can make out also what race they come from. Now better? Has he got some water or something? See. You must understand your children, they won't cry without a reason, they are all realised souls.
Thank you, thank you very much. 
Anything else?
[a yogini asks a question about working in negativity situation]
Shri Mataji: In your office? Negativity in the office? You see, all the negativity has an aspect also which I call as ridiculous and humorous. So anybody who is negative or something, you watch it, you see for yourself, don't get involved. Just see which part is it - it is ridiculous or it is humorous? Then you won't be serious about it. Sahaja Yogis have a sense of ridiculous, they understand what is ridiculous. Also they understand what is humorous or what is stupid. So just see that - 'It is stupid. Alright.' Just let it, it doesn't matter. What can you do? 
These children are growing so fast, you know. They are coming so tall, you can call them tall girls and all that. I'm just trying to make them out one after all. 
[about a baby] Feeling sleepy now. You sleep over, sleep, sleep. You can sleep now, if you like. Yes, why? Just watching Me all the time despite the light and all that... Anything else? Now, this is supposed to what? Brunch, dinner? Everything put together. So, baba!
