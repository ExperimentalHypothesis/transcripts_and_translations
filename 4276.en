b'\nTalk to Sahaja Yogis, with questions/answers,St.Martin\xe2\x80\x99s Lane, Covent Garden, London (UK), 8 April 1987.\n\nSome of you can come in front, Come along there\xe2\x80\x99s room... (laughs) Come along, there\xe2\x80\x99s room here. Come in ...there\xe2\x80\x99s room here (looks at prasad)... all full of sweets. Oh God... I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see all that (laughs).\n\n[From now on video and verified transcript begins]\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have some water\xe2\x80\xa6 Thank you (indistinct\xe2\x80\xa6 and bring My purse here.)\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m just watching all the beauty (She laughs).\n\nYou looked so beautiful at the airport. Such a joy for me to see you in that shape. It\xe2\x80\x99s a rare occasion sometimes that you feel oneness with the whole universe, absolutely oneness with the whole universe, when you feel the love that exists between all of you.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the love between you, oneness between you, the way you all have opened your heart to each other as good human beings, as realized souls, as saints - it\xe2\x80\x99s the most fulfilling and satisfying thing for Me.\n\nWhen a saint used to meet another saint, say in India, what would happen?\n\nThere was a saint in Maharashtra who was a tailor, but he was a saint. Saint is a saint whether he\xe2\x80\x99s a tailor or he could be anything. And there was another saint who was a potter, who used to make pots, and things like that, out of clay. So this saint, Namadeva, went to see this potter who was making some pots out of clay. And he looked at him. And the feeling that came into his heart is expressed - he was a great poet also, Namadeva - so he says, in Marathi it is, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll translate it in English \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cI came here to see the Chaitanya, the formless, but the formless is standing before me in the form\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSo to appreciate the other saint he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow the whole Chaitanya, the whole all-pervading power of God\xe2\x80\x99s love has come in your form before me. I see it\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nHow to address, just think of it. At that moment, spontaneously he said this.\n\nThat is how you are all saints, and saints have to see that, that you are the form of that love of God\xe2\x80\x99s all pervading power. You are in the form of that, all of you.\n\nI think that day, you were standing in the rain and sleet with all your children.\n\nFor a Mother it\xe2\x80\x99s too much to see, such beautiful feelings for me. But the feelings among yourselves, the open-heartedness, the Pure love, that filled the whole atmosphere with such beauty. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just talking, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just writing letters or sending Birthday cards or something like that; it\xe2\x80\x99s from the heart, you have to feel each other that you are all saints.\n\nYou are different people, you have to support each other, you have to look after each other, you have to understand each other because you are the people of a different awareness living among people who are blind, who can hit you, they can do some harm to you.\n\nThe other day I was reading Gyaneshwara; can you imagine, he died at the age of 23 years, at such an young age as 23 years. And the Gyaneshwari he wrote was at the age of 21 years. And what a genius! I mean, you read it, you just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, how could he penetrate so deep.\n\nHe described you all, as I have told you many-a-times he has described you as the oceans of, the walking oceans of Ambrose \xe2\x80\x93 Ambrosia. Talking trees, and the forest of the trees of bliss and beauty. That wherever you\xe2\x80\x99ll go you\xe2\x80\x99ll bless people.\n\nWherever you will stand you\xe2\x80\x99ll be auspicious, you will create harmony, peace and joy.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s your work, that\xe2\x80\x99s your style, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you are here for. But beware, you ought to be very careful, because the surroundings seem to be quite deceptive and quite troublesome.\n\nAnd from that surrounding you are coming out suddenly into a new surrounding where you have known what is Divine love, what is Divinity.\n\nOne has to be very careful because the forces that are negative are very strong, and working at you all the time, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve come from matter, you have evolved from matter and it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to go to matter, to materialism, to the materialistic ideas; and this materialism takes you to primitiveness. All your culture, all your beauty will drop out as soon as you take to materialism. If everything becomes money there\xe2\x80\x99s no place for God, no place for love, no place for beauty or for any graciousness.\n\nMoney is for us, we are not for the money. Money should be at our command. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to give up anything for that.\n\nAnd here then we see the materialism coming up in a very different way, very subtle ways, and we do not see it. When we start saying \xe2\x80\x9cmy, mine, this is mine\xe2\x80\x9d then you are slowly drifting towards materialism.\n\nWhen you see yourself in the collective, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way you can get out of materialism. Because you are in reality a collective being. You are not an individual that way. But the matter divides you from each other. And when you realize that we are not slaves of matter, matter is our slave, we are not going to be dominated by any matter, then you can feel that love.\n\nOne goes to absurd limits if you take to materialism; and everything can be explained in the name of materialism. But in the name of Divine how far can you go and explain?\n\nYou have to just enjoy it.\n\nWhen you enjoy you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to explain or talk about it, you just want to enjoy. Divinity is to be enjoyed within and without. It\xe2\x80\x99s within you, divinity is within you, but is to be enjoyed. That\xe2\x80\x99s only possible if you understand that you are not going to be dominated by any matter whatsoever.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m here for such a short time, I wish I could be with you forever, which I am, I think (laughs, laughter).\n\nBut you have brothers and sisters everywhere, the whole world has this message with them. You, some of you have met them in India. All the Indians have sent their love to you, lots of love, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to send you from there, something special; so they sent Me (She laughs, laughter and applause)\n\nSometimes I feel all of us should meet somewhere; all of us from all over the world, from every corner of the world, all the great saints who are in these modern times should meet each other, talk to each other, enjoy each other and understand each other.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the time we\xe2\x80\x99ll think that a new era has started of love, of trust, of enjoyment of other human beings.\n\nWhen you start enjoying another person then only we can say that you are in the collective.\n\nLike My finger, if it pains the another one tries to soothe it, and I feel the soothing, without feeling any gratitude or without feeling any sort of a obligation.\n\nSo always I say about collectivity. Those who cannot be collective, those who cannot open their hearts, those who keep aloof, those who think they are - some of them might be thinking \xe2\x80\x9cWe are great Sahaja Yogis because we are very old Sahaja Yogis,\xe2\x80\x9d some might be thinking \xe2\x80\x9cwe are very intelligent\xe2\x80\x9d, some that \xe2\x80\x9cwe are rich, and poor\xe2\x80\x9d and all that, all these differences should disappear.\n\nWho is crying? She\xe2\x80\x99s crying? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? (Yogini speaks: \xe2\x80\x9cClapping made him jump\xe2\x80\x9d. Yogi: \xe2\x80\x9cThe clapping made him jump, Mother\xe2\x80\x9d. Shri Mataji: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd loudly?\xe2\x80\x9d Yogi: \xe2\x80\x9cThe clapping made the baby jump, Shri Mataji\xe2\x80\x9d. Mother says \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d And laughs)\n\nOne day they\xe2\x80\x99ll all grow up. I was thinking when they\xe2\x80\x99ll grow up they\xe2\x80\x99ll clap much more than you will do! (Laughs, laughter) Little more time we need, somehow.\n\nAll these great people will be becoming great Sahaja Yogis and will give us such a pleasure, such a joy, such a happiness.\n\nToday I wanted to speak about something, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll just put it as a question to you all. And I would like to have an answer from you. You can write to Me and let\xe2\x80\x99s see, or you can discuss. That as formerly, as other saints have said, that once you get your realization you are lost, you can\xe2\x80\x99t speak about it.\n\nYou can just tell them by some similes, metaphors, this, that, but you cannot really give them the experience by telling them. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why many saints decided that after realization it\xe2\x80\x99s better to disappear. Even Gyaneshwara took his samadhi, he went into a room and he died in that room.\n\nBecause they could not say much about it, they could not tell much about it. But today that\xe2\x80\x99s not the situation.\n\nLike Kabira has said that, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a drop becomes the ocean, what can you say?\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nYou are lost, you are no more there, you are all finished. So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga, today\xe2\x80\x99s Sahaja Yoga, that we are all talking about it, experiencing it and enjoying it? That\xe2\x80\x99s the question for all of the Sahaja Yogis to solve.\n\n(Smiles and talks to somebody. Name not clear, sounds like \xe2\x80\x9cElliot\xe2\x80\x9d.) You can explain? Did you hear My question? No? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear My question?\n\nYou see, what I said was that formerly those people who got realisation got lost, alright?\n\nAs you were lost just now into thoughtless awareness! (She laughs, laughter).\n\nBut you can come back and you can tell people, you can talk about it, and many people disappeared.\n\nActually, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to live after getting realization for a long time, because they could not explain, talk to people about it.\n\nAlso they said that, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can a person who has no tongue tell about the taste of the jiggery?\xe2\x80\x9d, it\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of sweet. So there was a problem with them, all of them had a problem. But now you don\xe2\x80\x99t have that problem. So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga that you have no problem? So think it over and write to Me, alright?\n\nSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say anymore (laughter). Just we are enjoying our rapport with each other, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? That\xe2\x80\x99s all, sitting down here.\n\nAnybody has any questions? Anybody who is a new person can ask a question, would be good idea. Because these people have no questions now (Shri Mataji smells some flowers). Ask Me a question. (To somebody) I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the good news. Ah!\n\nYogi: Shri Mataji, how should we approach the spreading of Sahaja Yoga?\n\nShri Mataji: How can we\xe2\x80\xa6?\n\nYogi: How should we approach the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people?\n\nShri Mataji: What?\n\nAnother yogi: He said how should we approach the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people, to the new people. How should we express Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji?\n\nShri Mataji: To them? Now, you see, you\xe2\x80\x99ll meet three types of new people. Firstly, those who are yogis, or you can call them as people of previous births, who are already very knowledgeable and are there, just they can feel it, this is it; you won\xe2\x80\x99t have much problem with them, they\xe2\x80\x99ll know it is so. To them it\xe2\x80\x99s very obvious, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed the way they are there, how they have taken to it so easily.\n\nNow the second type are the people who may be still believing, non believing, maybe some who are doubting, maybe; or maybe some who are asking questions about it, quite a lot. So is not sufficient only for you to get your realization, also not sufficient for you that you feel the vibrations and that you can give realizations to others, that won\xe2\x80\x99t help much. You have to know how to deal with various types of people.\n\nLike I would say a person who is a, say, a priest, who comes to you and wants to talk to you about God, this, that and all that. So you must know Bible very well, and know Bible in the way a Sahaja Yogi should know.\n\nThe other day Rustom telephoned to tell Me that - I told him to study Koran because, I said, Islam means surrender, but before realisation surrender has no meaning. And he\xe2\x80\x99s told Me that it\xe2\x80\x99s written in Koran that unless and until you are connected with God you cannot understand anything what is written here. It\xe2\x80\x99s clearly said.\n\nNow when the Muslims talk to you, you can tell them: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is written in Koran, are you connected with God?\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nNow, they might say, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you connected?\xe2\x80\x9d. Now, then if you say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d, then finished! (Laughter) Then Mr. Ego will come up, you see, suddenly, and you be careful!\n\nSo this subject should be treated with a barge pole.\n\nLike, (laughs) such a question if they ask\xe2\x80\xa6 you see they will be like that, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you that?\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nLike in the beginning they used to ask Me, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your Father? What\xe2\x80\x99s your Mother? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d. This, that, all those things, you see.\n\nSo at that time you have to give an answer to them - [Can you give this lady a chair to sit down?(Hindi) Sit down. No\xe2\x80\xa6 Alright. (Hindi) Sit down... Sit down.]\n\nSo such a question if you answer in that manner you have not been clever enough; you have to be very clever. Then you should say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, there are\xe2\x80\x9d - avoid the subject, don\xe2\x80\x99t answer; you just say, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, there are descriptions about a person who is a realised soul\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nJung has said that you have to become collectively conscious. Now, what is collectively conscious? That is, on your central nervous system you should be able to feel another person.\n\nNow Jung has said so, it\xe2\x80\x99s a poet \xe2\x80\x93 [may this mean \xe2\x80\x9cquote\xe2\x80\x9d?]. Then you have got other people to quote: William Blake you can quote, you can quote other poets or saints whom you know, it depends on what sort of a person you are dealing with.\n\nBut just don\xe2\x80\x99t say, \xe2\x80\x9dYes, I am a realised soul\xe2\x80\x9d. People have been crucified, murdered, poisoned for saying that.\n\nSo be careful, put it on somebody else and say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the signs of a realised soul\xe2\x80\x99s are like this, that he has to be collectively conscious\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nFirst of all that you have read Jung or you know so much about collective consciousness itself will put them right in their own places, to begin with.\n\nBecause you have to be knowledgeable in these modern times, and you should be able to communicate. Just by telling them, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a realized soul, I have to awaken your Kundalini\xe2\x80\x9d, nobody is going to believe you.\n\nEven in India people don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that we can give realisation - although they know about realisation, they know about Kundalini, they know everything, but still they cannot believe that we, like ordinary people, can give realisation to them.\n\nSo in no way you should be diffident, but try to bring them round through somebody else, because the human nature is such, the one who is living, the one who is existing, they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to accept. Whosoever is dead, you see, and written somewhere, anything, in black and white, and if you say in this book this is this written, they\xe2\x80\x99ll accept. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you have to be knowledgeable, you must read books which are supportive of your realisation, supportive of Sahaja Yoga. Then only you can talk to them. If you are just having realisation, you can give realisation, you have got vibrations, that won\xe2\x80\x99t work out - especially in the Western countries where people are too much here (indicates the head) nothing there (indicates the heart).\n\nYou have to tell them that we are also intelligent enough, and we also understand it with our brains and logic, what is the truth is. Then after their realisation, of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s much easier, but if you say, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright, come along, I have to give you realisation\xe2\x80\x9d - you cannot. You cannot force them, you cannot - they have to ask for it, after all there is a protocol of the Divine also, the Divine cannot fall at the feet of people, \xe2\x80\x9cOh please, come and have your realisation!\xe2\x80\x9d. No, that\xe2\x80\x99s too much.\n\nBut there are ways and ways by which you can ask people and work it out. But I must tell you one thing, that all the Sahaja Yogis before, they started - I started Sahaja Yoga in the West and especially in England also, you see, whenever I talked to them they were very anxious how to get more people into Sahaja Yoga, how to bring more people, what to do for more people, how to manage. Or they would think somebody to be very spiritual or something, \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Mother, can I bring that fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d. And he would turn out to be a horrid stuff, you see (She laughs, laughter). It would burn My hands, it would burn everything, and I would say, \xe2\x80\x9cNow how do you mean? What made you think that he is spiritual?\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cMother, he talks so much of spirituality\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the thing. It is a calibre, is a inner calibre a person must have. He may be an ordinary person, he may not be earning so much money, he might be on the street, but the inner calibre has to be there. Otherwise, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of breaking your head against a wall?\n\nSo, this idea of having more and more is wrong. But to have people who are of that calibre, of that quality, and who deserve it.\n\nSo many do not deserve it.\n\nSo what to do? You cannot just... it\xe2\x80\x99s not like a barber shop that you can make the head dressed the way you like. The Sahastrara has to open out. You see, the Kundalini has to come out, it has to work that way. You cannot just say, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright now, you got realisation\xe2\x80\x9d, you can\xe2\x80\x99t say that way, all the time the Kundalini\xe2\x80\x99s falling down, you should say, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright, sorry sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x9d. Finished.\n\nAnd the more you show as if you are seeking elections for the votes, the more they\xe2\x80\x99ll be worse. If somebody doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get realisation, well and good! For example, a lady met Me in a place and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to have realisation\xe2\x80\x9d. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try\xe2\x80\x9d (laughter, She laughs).\n\nThen she wrote three letters to Me, sent her photographs and she\xe2\x80\xa6 And then she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why You don\xe2\x80\x99t write to me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been writing to You, this and that, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult task to give a realisation\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x9d - so I talked to her - \xe2\x80\x9cAlright, when I come next in June you can come along\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nBut there could be somebody who might be of that calibre, you can feel it, you are knowledgeable yourself, you can feel the vibrations, you can feel it and you can then take that person seriously. So work on the people who are simple, who have that calibre.\n\nOf course, they could be very much spoilt also because of seeking, but if they are intense and sincere then the best thing is to work it out with complete assiduity and attention to such a person.\n\nBut if it\xe2\x80\x99s a fashion, you see, because they are going to many gurus and they are doing some, lots of guru shopping, then you should say, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no shop here, you can\xe2\x80\x99t pay, first of all, you can\xe2\x80\x99t pay\xe2\x80\x9d. If they understand that, then it\xe2\x80\x99s alright. Say like one fellow from the BBC came in and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t believe in a guru who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take any money\xe2\x80\x9d. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThen alright, you go to such a guru who takes money from you, I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to say\xe2\x80\x9d. He said - what did he say? \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cAnglo Saxon brain\xe2\x80\x9d. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that brain is specially, made by God or not? (She laughs, laughter) Cannot understand anyone who can do such a thing without money.\n\nSuch a person you should say, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright, thank you very much, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you see, you are beyond me, you are too great, sorry\xe2\x80\x9d. Not hurting the person. But such ideas, such things if they have there in brains, you cannot break such a hard nut, can you? And you should not feel sorry for them.\n\nFirst see their vibrations, see their calibre. Calibre is the only way you can judge how much attention is to be paid, what is to be done.\n\nFor some people it\xe2\x80\x99s so obvious, so obvious. And some people go on arguing, arguing with you. But all of them now are good Sahaja Yogis despite the fact they argued quite a lot with Me to begin with; now they are very good Sahaja Yogis. But now time has come for you to have a quick result, and you will meet people who will be very good, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll meet all of them who are in England and you, you will be able to manage them. Your ways, your methods, your styles will convince them.\n\nToday, only, Doctor Brian has told Me that many people are getting interested now in Sahaja Yoga, because they can see the change that comes in, the transformation, the confidence, everything that they see.\n\nSo you should not try to force Sahaja Yoga on anyone; it\xe2\x80\x99s better that you see their calibre. Calibre is very easy to make out.\n\nYou just say it and it is there. They know, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\n\nAny other question?\n\nYogini: Shri Mataji, please, could you talk about simpathy and compassion towards other Sahaja Yogis who have problems, who have some negativity in them, please?\n\nShri Mataji: I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear. What\xe2\x80\x99s it? Clearly, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. You also didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\n\nYogi: Shri Mataji?\n\nShri Mataji: Ah.\n\nYogi: Could You speak about sympathy and compassion towards other Sahaja Yogis who have problems with negativity?\n\nShri Mataji: Ah. Now. Sympathy and compassion; sympathy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get involved, then it\xe2\x80\x99s compassion. Sympathy. \xe2\x80\x98Sym\xe2\x80\x99 means \xe2\x80\x98share\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98pathy\xe2\x80\x99 means \xe2\x80\x98pathos\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 if you want to share the pathos of another person then you are sympathizing with that person.\n\nNow supposing, somebody\xe2\x80\x99s husband is dead and that person is crying a lot and you also go and sit down and cry louder than her (laughter). Then people will ask you, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you husband die or her husband die?\xe2\x80\x9d (laughter). \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I am just showing sympathy, you know\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter, She laughs). This is lip sympathy, of course.\n\nAnother is \xe2\x80\x93 may be the heartfelt sympathy. When it is heartfelt then you don\xe2\x80\x99t cry; then you develop the opposite force to put that person right. What do you say to that person?\n\nYou should say, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, now if you are born you are going to die, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s going to die, that\xe2\x80\x99s, that\xe2\x80\x99s the system. Now, two persons never die together. This gentleman who has died now, he\xe2\x80\x99s your husband, alright, but now if you start crying like this, he won\xe2\x80\x99t have any peace, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be hovering round you, and he might be in limbo waiting for you to come there, or something like that. So no use crying over him, on the contrary, you should say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m alright, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about me, I\xe2\x80\x99m alright, get your realisation as I have got it\xe2\x80\x9d. This is the opposite force that you put. This is a real, real way of helping that person.\n\nBut the compassion is very different, compassion just flows, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. Even you don\xe2\x80\x99t see Me, even if you are in the hospital, you know I am with you.\n\nIt works. Even if you just think of Me, it works.\n\nEven if you make some mistakes, you know Mother will forgive. That\xe2\x80\x99s compassion. Compassion is just flow, you don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it, you don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. It just flows and covers you completely. And you enjoy that. That\xe2\x80\x99s compassion; it works - sympathy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work - compassion works, it soothes you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very beautiful touch of love, affection, kindness, protection. And you feel so confident that you are under the protection of the Divine.\n\nSo, this compassion has not to be shown or to be dealt with.\n\nNow supposing, another Sahaja Yogi\xe2\x80\x99s having a problem. We have only two problems; as I say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow many turns there are in London? Only two, left or right\xe2\x80\x9d (laughter).\n\nIn the same way, they have two problems: either left or right. If it is the left one or the right one.\n\nYou know right one you have to beat with the shoes, that\xe2\x80\x99s all, finished. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go and say anything to the person, if he has right problems.\n\nNow if he has the left problem what do you do? You need not go and talk to that person: give him a bandhan, you can burn the name, you can do what you like. But you need not face the person, you need not tell the person that, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m helping you, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do something for you\xe2\x80\x9d. That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, that\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say that; it just works, it has to work by itself.\n\nBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to help you in any way, do I? Nothing of the kind.\n\nWherever you are you know I\xe2\x80\x99m with you, all the time. In the same way, this compassion will work whether you are sitting down here, if you are beating somebody with shoes that person will come round.\n\nSo they have only two problems, one is the left or the right. If you try to sympathize with any one of them you are in trouble.\n\nSo best thing is not to directly help them, but indirectly. Not to tell them that you are helping, not even mention it to them; the concern is the point, the concern about a person.\n\nYour attention should go there, your attention is very active. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very powerful thing you have got, your attention acts. Just put your attention to that person, with a concern, but no involvement: that is compassion.\n\nYou have got it, you have got the power of compassion in your attention now, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t used it. Without taking any credit for it, without showing it, without confronting it, just inside yourself you feel it, it will work out.\n\nBut for that you have to cleanse your own attention, that\xe2\x80\x99s very important. If your attention is loose type, if your connection is not alright, then it won\xe2\x80\x99t work out. But if you have that kind of an attention which is silent, which is witnessing, which is not involved, it\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic, it works!\n\nAll of you have to become like Me, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you all can, and achieve that calibre of compassion. Alright?\n\nDo you follow now? Thank you.\n\nAny other question, Hester? No? Danya has any questions? (She laughs) You never had them. Anybody else? Jason? None!\n\nQuestion-less people, I tell you.\n\nBest way is to enjoy others. Best way is to enjoy others; and to enjoy yourself is to laugh at yourself, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best way.\n\nAddress yourself, \xe2\x80\x9cYou, Mister, now come along, this is ego, I know (laughter). Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, that\xe2\x80\x99s the one! No no no no no no no no no, not me! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of it\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how you enjoy yourself. And enjoy others, seeing their good points. Sweet, sweet things they do, very sweet things. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say anything.\n\nAnd we had 71 marriages, you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. And I looked at the brides and they were all looking at Me from the angles, you see; and the eyes were telling the story of their love and gratitude, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all they said.\n\nI was just watching them when they were walking with their garlands in their hands, slowly, slowly; the sweetness, the beauty of their feelings; very slowly they were walking. And then I saw the boys standing there, looking at Me with tremendous feeling of oneness.\n\nYou see, this cannot be enjoyed otherwise.\n\nEven with the body you cannot enjoy, supposing you rub your hand, you won\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy that much as you enjoy other people, other sahaja yogis.\n\nAnd then the friends doing the leg-pulling also I enjoy (laughter), the way they talk to each other I enjoy, everything\xe2\x80\x99s so enjoyable, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt anyone, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble anyone.\n\nYou are here to enjoy, God has created this universe for you to enjoy.\n\nSo only thing is that you must improve your attention, cleanse your attention by meditation, always think of good things, not of bad things. You should not react too much, just be within yourself, see for yourself, witness everything. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see beautiful points, beautiful things all around you.\n\nSo much of beauty which we are losing because we cannot see it. So that deep, penetrating attention of concern will solve all the problems, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\n\nBut \xe2\x80\x98open your heart\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you go and hug somebody and kiss somebody ten times, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that at all. On the contrary, it can be quite embarrassing, you know? (Laughter, She smiles, laughs) Any other questions?\n\nI, I had a problem there, you see, we, they arranged a programme for Me to speak to the young presidents\xe2\x80\x99 organisation, the presidents of big, big \xe2\x80\x93 of big, big organisations, business organisations, and I had to speak to them.\n\nAnd one of the lady - of course, I mean - the questions were very good and everything flowing (?) over, and later on she says, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, because she is not at all serious, you see\xe2\x80\x9d (laughter, She laughs). And I laughed and laughed and laughed with that, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I cannot be serious anymore, that was too much\xe2\x80\x9d (laughter, She laughs).\n\nWhen there\xe2\x80\x99s so much joy bubbling out, why, how can you be serious?\n\nThis is the idea of a saint that he should be very serious, stern, going out with a stick in his hand all the time hitting everyone on the head (laughter, laughs). So, any other question (indistinct word)? No.\n\nWe must have a hall here, big hall we should buy somewhere, we should be able to buy.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m thankful to people who are working on Shudy Camp but I think you must hurry up now, people are coming for Guru Puja, I told them we\xe2\x80\x99ll have it in Shudy Camp. And otherwise if it is not ready we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to change the venue, so everybody must go and work it out, I think, is important. We have money, we have no problem on that.\n\nWe have to have a nice, grand, beautiful seminar before Guru Puja. And there are many coming here, you\xe2\x80\x99ll meet all of them, will be a very nice time, real festival we\xe2\x80\x99ll be having.\n\nSo it would be better that you, all of you combine together and work it out and also give different work to different people; and they should all try to organize it in a beautiful way that there\xe2\x80\x99s no quarrel, nothing.\n\nBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll see people, you see, will say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! This is the room I would like to have for my wife\xe2\x80\x9d (laughter), things like that. Sounds stupidity. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the glass for me, I can\xe2\x80\x99t give it to you\xe2\x80\x9d. All such stupid things will be there, and I think, for such people you should say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not for Guru Puja, better not be here\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nEverybody doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be there. That\xe2\x80\x99s you should find out, that what sort of people they are. If they are fighting for all these little, little things it\xe2\x80\x99s best is to tell them that, \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, you\xe2\x80\x99d better not come for Guru Puja\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSo, the most important thing is that in Guru Puja we have to receive a special capacity to be a guru ourselves.\n\nA special intelligence, a special understanding, a kind of a wisdom which gives you discretion and the ability to argue out things.\n\nThat will enhance your personality, a beautiful, dignified personality can be created within yourselves, so for that you have to be there with all that dedication and understanding about yourself.\n\nSo I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to this Guru Puja, and everybody has to write. Now for Sahastrara day they are working so hard, the people from Australia have printed so many posters, all over the world they have sent it, they have sent it to you also the posters of Sahastrar Day - have you brought it? No? You haven\xe2\x80\x99t shown them.\n\nSo next time you must show all of them, they should see that, what they have done, how much; and you must - we have no, nothing like a news from there and this thing - but all this can be discussed among yourself; and you should know about each other, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, where, and what ashram is doing, what is the special work they are doing, and what is the new thing they have discovered; all sorts of things you can find out from each other. And you can tell others also. This is how you keep in communication with each other.\n\nOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a very good news, that Doctor Rai, who is the Dean of the Faculty of Physiology in Delhi University, started a research work on the comparative study of Sahaja Yogis and others as far as the physiology is concerned. And he\xe2\x80\x99s found out that the people who are not Sahaja Yogis have a very low resistance for diseases, their skin, skin resistance is less and so many things he\xe2\x80\x99s found out. And he has put it on, he\xe2\x80\x99s tabulated the whole thing, and that is been now approved by the Government and is now published, going to be published also.\n\nIn the same way, you see, we are thinking of having a research here done for people in Shudy Camp, so that we can also publish something like that with the research. That so far, you see, so many have been cured, so many got rid of their addictions, so many got rid of their mental problems, so many things happened; but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet recorded it, we have not put it properly on the record.\n\nNow this is what we are going to do now, anybody who has achieved something or has felt better or has been cured or something like that must give it in writing to these people so they record it, because, you see, in these modern times they want everything in black and white, so that could be done very well here in England.\n\nAnother thing I was thinking that now \xe2\x80\x9cNirmala Yoga\xe2\x80\x9d has stopped there because of this problem of foreign exchange.\n\nSo what we can do is to have a \xe2\x80\x9cNirmala Yog\xe2\x80\x9d published in India and sent here, and you can print it here and sell it here, so that the foreign exchange problem doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come in.\n\nBecause foreign exchange is such a problem in that country, you have to have a proper committee, this, that, all headaches.\n\nSo you can sell them here and distribute them here, it\xe2\x80\x99s very easy, and Paul can help you there. Paul, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\n\nPaul: Yes...\n\nShri Mataji: Yes. So it\xe2\x80\x99s alright. We get the \xe2\x80\x9cNirmala Yog\xe2\x80\x9d done there and just the copy sent here, translated. You can also add to it, you can also put something into it and some things from there and some things from here; you can distribute it to all the centres here and we can start like that. Because they created a big problem out of that last \xe2\x80\x9cNirmala Yoga\xe2\x80\x9d, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve just stopped it, because you see we, we are not very good at human laws, I think, sometimes you make mistakes and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you people to be caught up into these human laws.\n\nSo you have to be careful. And we can do it, I think we can do it. And as England is the heart it has to circulate everything. But the hearts must open out. The conditioning is very bad here, you see, that you are told that you should not express your feelings, you should not say anything, you should be very poised, you should not talk about your feelings.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not so in Sahaja Yoga. This is the heart and heart must speak, heart must say; you must know how to say that you love others. It\xe2\x80\x99s very easy to say \xe2\x80\x98I hate\xe2\x80\x99, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for people to say \xe2\x80\x98I love you\xe2\x80\x99. Because they are afraid, they fear that if you commit like this, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, so you love me? So do this for me. You love me? So do this for me (laughter). How dare you say you love me, if you have loved me you must do all this and you must give this to me\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nOh, we had some Sahaja Yogis like that. They were abusing Me also that, \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you love us, then why don\xe2\x80\x99t You do this for us?\xe2\x80\x9d. Then it becomes a demanding love.\n\nAny other question anywhere? What\xe2\x80\x99s happening, John, about your priesthood? [Shri Mataji laughs]\n\nThey are getting quite exposed.\n\nJohn: Yes, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Exposure is the only way, but still nothing goes into the heads of the people, they are so egoistical, nobody wants to accept that it\xe2\x80\x99s all exposed now within \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98No, it is fanaticism, it is nonsense\xe2\x80\x99. But still they go on with it, what to do?\n\n(Mother looks around at the yogis then smiles) Beautiful children you have here. How many are new people who are seeing Me for the first time? Raise your hands please. Ah!\n\nAh, you all look little serious! (laughter, She laughs) Still rather serious. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be serious at all. Good. Nice. Get the children. He is just hitting the head. (She laughs) Who is the child crying there so much? Whose child? (A yogi says something inaudible) This child? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? Must be hot. Take out the sweater. Eh?\n\n(Somebody says something) It\xe2\x80\x99s alright. I think, must be hot for the child. And they feel very thirsty also, you see, these are places where you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any humidity much, so they feel very thirsty also in such places, I think.\n\n(Shri Mataji listens to the baby who continues to cry)\n\nAll of them cry the same, whether they are Indians, English, anything! (Laughter) From their crying you can\xe2\x80\x99t make out what race they come from. (Baby stops crying) Now better?\n\nHave you got some water or something? See! You must understand your children, they won\xe2\x80\x99t cry without a reason. They are all realised souls. Alright.\n\n(Yogi hands Shri Mataji a glass of water)\n\nThank you, thank you very much. Anything else?\n\n(Someone asks an inaudible question)\n\nShri Mataji: Can you say\xe2\x80\xa6?\n\nYogi repeats to Her: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you best cope if you have to work in a negative situation?\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nShri Mataji: In your office?\n\nYogi: Job, yes.\n\nShri Mataji: Negativity in the office?\n\nYogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.\n\nShri Mataji: You see, all the negativity have also, has also an aspect which I call is ridiculous and humorous; so anybody who is negative or anything you watch it, see for yourself, don\xe2\x80\x99t get involved, just see which part it is, is it ridiculous or it is humorous (laughter). Then you won\xe2\x80\x99t be serious about it.\n\nSahaja Yogis have a sense of ridiculous, you see, they understand what is ridiculous is; also they understand what is humorous or what is stupid. So just see that, it is stupid? Alright, let it be, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, what can you do?\n\nThese children are growing so fast, you know. They\xe2\x80\x99re so becoming all tall, girls and all that. I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to make them out one after another. (She looks at a baby near Her)\n\n[The following part is not on this video so could not be verified]\n\nFeeling sleepy now.\n\nJust sleep off. Sleep, sleep. You can sleep now with light, yeah, why? Just watching Me all the time, you see, despite the laying down (Shri Mataji laughs).\n\nAnything else? Now this is supposed to be what? Brunch, dinner, everything put together. (Laughter) Wah. So wah wah.\n\nI think we should say the mantras for three times, the Sahastrara mantras and then we can have this.\n\nPut your hands like this (Shri Mataji shows her hands in meditating position) Straight. Hands should be straight.\n\n[Yogis say the Three Sahastrara mantras]\n\nThere are certain routines I think we should follow because Hamsa is catching for the new people and this is due to this dryness I think in the room there is dryness, in the places where you work there is dryness and in the house there is dryness. So must use this ghee for the nose. I think one drop in every nostril once in the morning and once in the evening would be good, because I can feel it in Hamsa, the drying out, the...\n\nIf you are getting also drying out in the throat and you feel that all the time there\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of a coughing so the best thing for that is to put a few drops of ghee on hot milk or hot water and take that so the whole thing spreads here (Indicates the throat from left to right) and it makes it smooth. As you see our hands and all that needs some cream we need this for our _________ we can call it the epithelial cells which are lining and when this line becomes dried out then you feel very funny.\n\nI mean the whole attention gets very upset so I think you should get try in London, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea, to keep a bottle of ghee with you, and you can heat it in the water, hot water, just like you can hold it under a tap and it will work out, and then put two drops in the morning and two drops in the night, before sleeping it will be a good idea.\n\nThe dryness will go off and also in the ear I think we should put some sort of an Olive oil or something will be good idea, because all... I feel the dryness very much since I\xe2\x80\x99ve come in London I can feel that you people have this dryness. That\xe2\x80\x99s a very common thing and that can also solve your problem of hay fever and all those things.\n\nNow for liver we have found out great things and I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll now sit down and write all that is to be done for liver and we can circulate it to all the members what is to be.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s very, very simple things that you have to do it and if it works out them all your liver problems will be over.\n\nMost of the diseases are there because of the liver so I think I should circulate that and it\xe2\x80\x99s very simple, not much of medicine or anything but it\xe2\x80\x99s very simple and it will work out.\n\nThis time it\xe2\x80\x99s surprising all the Sahaja Yogis kept very good health on India tour, none of them had problem on the liver, nothing of the kind, surprising, every one of them.\n\nSo also it is connected, you see, with the flowing; if you have the cold which is all the time flowing and it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of giving you sneezing and all that, you must know it is due to liver, It\xe2\x80\x99s surprising! I hope the doctors will forgive me when I tell this, that you see when the liver gives the heat the phlegm in the body melts and gives these problems. When the phlegm melts, you see, you start getting the water flowing through your nose and also you get other problems like sneezing and also hay fever. All those things are from liver.\n\nIf liver is alright....that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s called liver because it\xe2\x80\x99s connected with life... If your liver is alright you won\xe2\x80\x99t have these problems, and that circulation we must send. (Looks at a yogi)\n\nI think if you can come tomorrow sometime to write down all those things that are to be done for the two (?) and all those who... and also sort of your friends and all that you can tell them that for liver take this, it\xe2\x80\x99s very important.\n\nSo, are you not going to sing a song tome? Who? Let\xe2\x80\x99s be having! What about Bristol group?\n\nYou know I have an idea, I must tell you, I thought in India we can start a kind of Sahaja Disco! (Laughter) Nobody knows what you sing in a disco, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But you can give them realisation secretly! And now In India they think that you are very great people to have discos and all that sort of thing. Disco is a very big thing (laughter)\n\nSo who\xe2\x80\x99s going to sing? Where are the musicians? They\xe2\x80\x99re all distributed all over. Let him sing, he sings very well Yah! Very good! He\xe2\x80\x99s got it (Probably referring to Bernard\xe2\x80\x99s guitar) I knew! (Bernard arrives with guitar).\n\n(Possibly talking to Shri Mataji of previously crying baby) He\xe2\x80\x99s alright now, see! (To Bernard) Where are your companions? Hmm! Let him come. Hello!\n\nBut he sings! I never knew. (Someone hands something to Shri Mataji) Oh God, that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary, just give it like that, in the hands, it\xe2\x80\x99s alright, just in the hands, not good to eat a lot\n\nSo is there any restriction in this hall?\n\n(Looks at watch) You can come in, Danya, there\xe2\x80\x99s room there, just come along. Why are you standing all the time? You can come here. How is your mother? She\xe2\x80\x99s here, is she? How\xe2\x80\x99s her throat? I can\xe2\x80\x99t see her. How are you Magda? Better? May God bless you (to Magda)\n\n(Shri Mataji organizes a little table being placed in front of Her and tells yogis She can hold a plate in Her hand) It\xe2\x80\x99s alright, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite safe in My hand! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry about anything else.\n\n(To Cyril - older yogi from Birmingham) I think you can sit on the steps, it would be better for you, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult.\n\n[Yogis start singing bhajan: \xe2\x80\x9cOm Bhur Bhuvah\xe2\x80\x9d ]\n'
