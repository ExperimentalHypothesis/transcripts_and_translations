Some of you can come in front, Come along there’s room... (laughs) Come along, there’s room here. Come in ...there’s room here (looks at prasad)... all full of sweets. Oh God... I didn’t see all that (laughs).

[From now on video and verified transcript begins]

I’ll have some water... Thank you (indistinct... and bring My purse here.)

I’m just watching all the beauty (She laughs).

You looked so beautiful at the airport. Such a joy for me to see you in that shape. It’s a rare occasion sometimes that you feel oneness with the whole universe, absolutely oneness with the whole universe, when you feel the love that exists between all of you.

It’s the love between you, oneness between you, the way you all have opened your heart to each other as good human beings, as realized souls, as saints - it’s the most fulfilling and satisfying thing for Me.

When a saint used to meet another saint, say in India, what would happen?

There was a saint in Maharashtra who was a tailor, but he was a saint. Saint is a saint whether he’s a tailor or he could be anything. And there was another saint who was a potter, who used to make pots, and things like that, out of clay. So this saint, Namadeva, went to see this potter who was making some pots out of clay. And he looked at him. And the feeling that came into his heart is expressed - he was a great poet also, Namadeva - so he says, in Marathi it is, but I’ll translate it in English – “I came here to see the Chaitanya, the formless, but the formless is standing before me in the form”.

So to appreciate the other saint he said, “Now the whole Chaitanya, the whole all-pervading power of God’s love has come in your form before me. I see it”.

How to address, just think of it. At that moment, spontaneously he said this.

That is how you are all saints, and saints have to see that, that you are the form of that love of God’s all pervading power. You are in the form of that, all of you.

I think that day, you were standing in the rain and sleet with all your children.

For a Mother it’s too much to see, such beautiful feelings for me. But the feelings among yourselves, the open-heartedness, the Pure love, that filled the whole atmosphere with such beauty. It’s not just talking, it’s not just writing letters or sending Birthday cards or something like that; it’s from the heart, you have to feel each other that you are all saints.

You are different people, you have to support each other, you have to look after each other, you have to understand each other because you are the people of a different awareness living among people who are blind, who can hit you, they can do some harm to you.

The other day I was reading Gyaneshwara; can you imagine, he died at the age of 23 years, at such an young age as 23 years. And the Gyaneshwari he wrote was at the age of 21 years. And what a genius! I mean, you read it, you just don’t understand, how could he penetrate so deep.

He described you all, as I have told you many-a-times he has described you as the oceans of, the walking oceans of Ambrose – Ambrosia. Talking trees, and the forest of the trees of bliss and beauty. That wherever you’ll go you’ll bless people.

Wherever you will stand you’ll be auspicious, you will create harmony, peace and joy.

That’s your work, that’s your style, that’s what you are here for. But beware, you ought to be very careful, because the surroundings seem to be quite deceptive and quite troublesome.

And from that surrounding you are coming out suddenly into a new surrounding where you have known what is Divine love, what is Divinity.

One has to be very careful because the forces that are negative are very strong, and working at you all the time, because you’ve come from matter, you have evolved from matter and it’s easy to go to matter, to materialism, to the materialistic ideas; and this materialism takes you to primitiveness. All your culture, all your beauty will drop out as soon as you take to materialism. If everything becomes money there’s no place for God, no place for love, no place for beauty or for any graciousness.

Money is for us, we are not for the money. Money should be at our command. We don’t have to give up anything for that.

And here then we see the materialism coming up in a very different way, very subtle ways, and we do not see it. When we start saying “my, mine, this is mine” then you are slowly drifting towards materialism.

When you see yourself in the collective, that’s the only way you can get out of materialism. Because you are in reality a collective being. You are not an individual that way. But the matter divides you from each other. And when you realize that we are not slaves of matter, matter is our slave, we are not going to be dominated by any matter, then you can feel that love.

One goes to absurd limits if you take to materialism; and everything can be explained in the name of materialism. But in the name of Divine how far can you go and explain?

You have to just enjoy it.

When you enjoy you don’t want to explain or talk about it, you just want to enjoy. Divinity is to be enjoyed within and without. It’s within you, divinity is within you, but is to be enjoyed. That’s only possible if you understand that you are not going to be dominated by any matter whatsoever.

I’m sorry I’m here for such a short time, I wish I could be with you forever, which I am, I think (laughs, laughter).

But you have brothers and sisters everywhere, the whole world has this message with them. You, some of you have met them in India. All the Indians have sent their love to you, lots of love, and they didn’t know what to send you from there, something special; so they sent Me (She laughs, laughter and applause)

Sometimes I feel all of us should meet somewhere; all of us from all over the world, from every corner of the world, all the great saints who are in these modern times should meet each other, talk to each other, enjoy each other and understand each other.

That’s the time we’ll think that a new era has started of love, of trust, of enjoyment of other human beings.

When you start enjoying another person then only we can say that you are in the collective.

Like My finger, if it pains the another one tries to soothe it, and I feel the soothing, without feeling any gratitude or without feeling any sort of a obligation.

So always I say about collectivity. Those who cannot be collective, those who cannot open their hearts, those who keep aloof, those who think they are - some of them might be thinking “We are great Sahaja Yogis because we are very old Sahaja Yogis,” some might be thinking “we are very intelligent”, some that “we are rich, and poor” and all that, all these differences should disappear.

Who is crying? She’s crying? What’s the matter? (Yogini speaks: “Clapping made him jump”. Yogi: “The clapping made him jump, Mother”. Shri Mataji: “And loudly?” Yogi: “The clapping made the baby jump, Shri Mataji”. Mother says “Oh!” And laughs)

One day they’ll all grow up. I was thinking when they’ll grow up they’ll clap much more than you will do! (Laughs, laughter) Little more time we need, somehow.

All these great people will be becoming great Sahaja Yogis and will give us such a pleasure, such a joy, such a happiness.

Today I wanted to speak about something, but I’ll just put it as a question to you all. And I would like to have an answer from you. You can write to Me and let’s see, or you can discuss. That as formerly, as other saints have said, that once you get your realization you are lost, you can’t speak about it.

You can just tell them by some similes, metaphors, this, that, but you cannot really give them the experience by telling them. And that’s why many saints decided that after realization it’s better to disappear. Even Gyaneshwara took his samadhi, he went into a room and he died in that room.

Because they could not say much about it, they could not tell much about it. But today that’s not the situation.

Like Kabira has said that, “When a drop becomes the ocean, what can you say?”.

You are lost, you are no more there, you are all finished. So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga, today’s Sahaja Yoga, that we are all talking about it, experiencing it and enjoying it? That’s the question for all of the Sahaja Yogis to solve.

(Smiles and talks to somebody. Name not clear, sounds like “Elliot”.) You can explain? Did you hear My question? No? You didn’t hear My question?

You see, what I said was that formerly those people who got realisation got lost, alright?

As you were lost just now into thoughtless awareness! (She laughs, laughter).

But you can come back and you can tell people, you can talk about it, and many people disappeared.

Actually, they didn’t want to live after getting realization for a long time, because they could not explain, talk to people about it.

Also, they said that, “How can a person who has no tongue tell about the taste of the jaggery?”, it’s a kind of sweet. So there was a problem with them, all of them had a problem. But now you don’t have that problem. So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga that you have no problem? So think it over and write to Me, all right?

So I don’t know what to say anymore (laughter). Just we are enjoying our rapport with each other, isn’t it? That’s all, sitting down here.

Anybody has any questions? Anybody who is a new person can ask a question, would be good idea. Because these people have no questions now (Shri Mataji smells some flowers). Ask Me a question. (To somebody) I’ve heard the good news. Ah!

Yogi: Shri Mataji, how should we approach the spreading of Sahaja Yoga?

Shri Mataji: How can we...?

Yogi: How should we approach the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people?

Shri Mataji: What?

Another yogi: He said how should we approach the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people, to the new people. How should we express Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: To them? Now, you see, you’ll meet three types of new people. Firstly, those who are yogis, or you can call them as people of previous births, who are already very knowledgeable and are there, just they can feel it, this is it; you won’t have much problem with them, they’ll know it is so. To them it’s very obvious, and you’ll be amazed the way they are there, how they have taken to it so easily.

Now the second type are the people who may be still believing, non believing, maybe some who are doubting, maybe; or maybe some who are asking questions about it, quite a lot. So is not sufficient only for you to get your realization, also not sufficient for you that you feel the vibrations and that you can give realizations to others, that won’t help much. You have to know how to deal with various types of people.

Like I would say a person who is a, say, a priest, who comes to you and wants to talk to you about God, this, that and all that. So you must know Bible very well, and know Bible in the way a Sahaja Yogi should know.

The other day Rustom telephoned to tell Me that - I told him to study Koran because, I said, Islam means surrender, but before realisation surrender has no meaning. And he’s told Me that it’s written in Koran that unless and until you are connected with God you cannot understand anything what is written here. It’s clearly said.

Now when the Muslims talk to you, you can tell them: “This is written in Koran, are you connected with God?”.

Now, they might say, “Are you connected?”. Now, then if you say, “Yes”, then finished! (Laughter) Then Mr. Ego will come up, you see, suddenly, and you be careful!

So this subject should be treated with a barge pole.

Like, (laughs) such a question if they ask... you see they will be like that, “Are you that?”.

Like in the beginning they used to ask Me, “What’s your Father? What’s your Mother? Who are you?”. This, that, all those things, you see.

So at that time you have to give an answer to them - [Can you give this lady a chair to sit down?(Hindi) Sit down. No... Alright. (Hindi) Sit down... Sit down.]

So such a question if you answer in that manner you have not been clever enough; you have to be very clever. Then you should say, “You see, there are” - avoid the subject, don’t answer; you just say, “See, there are descriptions about a person who is a realised soul”.

Jung has said that you have to become collectively conscious. Now, what is collectively conscious? That is, on your central nervous system you should be able to feel another person.

Now Jung has said so, it’s a poet – [may this mean “quote”?]. Then you have got other people to quote: William Blake you can quote, you can quote other poets or saints whom you know, it depends on what sort of a person you are dealing with.

But just don’t say, ”Yes, I am a realised soul”. People have been crucified, murdered, poisoned for saying that.

So be careful, put it on somebody else and say, “Yes, the signs of a realised soul’s are like this, that he has to be collectively conscious”.

First of all that you have read Jung or you know so much about collective consciousness itself will put them right in their own places, to begin with.

Because you have to be knowledgeable in these modern times, and you should be able to communicate. Just by telling them, “I’m a realized soul, I have to awaken your Kundalini”, nobody is going to believe you.

Even in India people don’t believe that we can give Realization - although they know about realisation, they know about Kundalini, they know everything, but still, they cannot believe that we, like ordinary people, can give realisation to them.

So in no way, you should be diffident, but try to bring them round through somebody else, because the human nature is such, the one who is living, the one who is existing, they don’t want to accept. Whosoever is dead, you see, and written somewhere, anything, in black and white, and if you say in this book this is this written, they’ll accept. That’s why you have to be knowledgeable, you must read books which are supportive of your realisation, supportive of Sahaja Yoga. Then only you can talk to them. If you are just having Realization, you can give Realization, you have got vibrations, that won’t work out - especially in the Western countries where people are too much here (indicates the head) nothing there (indicates the heart).

You have to tell them that we are also intelligent enough, and we also understand it with our brains and logic, what is the truth is. Then after their realisation, of course, it’s much easier, but if you say, “Alright, come along, I have to give you realisation” - you cannot. You cannot force them, you cannot - they have to ask for it, after all, there is a protocol of the Divine also, the Divine cannot fall at the feet of people, “Oh please, come and have your Realization !”. No, that’s too much.

But there are ways and ways by which you can ask people and work it out. But I must tell you one thing, that all the Sahaja Yogis before, they started - I started Sahaja Yoga in the West and especially in England also, you see, whenever I talked to them they were very anxious how to get more people into Sahaja Yoga, how to bring more people, what to do for more people, how to manage. Or they would think somebody to be very spiritual or something, “So, Mother, can I bring that fellow?”. And he would turn out to be a horrid stuff, you see (She laughs, laughter). It would burn My hands, it would burn everything, and I would say, “Now how do you mean? What made you think that he is spiritual?”. “Mother, he talks so much of spirituality”.

That’s not the thing. It is a calibre, is a inner calibre a person must have. He may be an ordinary person, he may not be earning so much money, he might be on the street, but the inner calibre has to be there. Otherwise, what’s the use of breaking your head against a wall?

So, this idea of having more and more is wrong. But to have people who are of that calibre, of that quality, and who deserve it.

So many do not deserve it.

So what to do? You cannot just... it’s not like a barber shop that you can make the head dressed the way you like. The Sahasrara has to open out. You see, the Kundalini has to come out, it has to work that way. You cannot just say, “Alright now, you got Realization ”, you can’t say that way, all the time the Kundalini’s falling down, you should say, “Alright, sorry sir, I’m sorry”. Finished.

And the more you show as if you are seeking elections for the votes, the more they’ll be worse. If somebody doesn’t get Realization, well and good! For example, a lady met Me in a place and she said, “I want to have realisation”. I said, “Alright, I’ll try” (laughter, She laughs).

Then she wrote three letters to Me, sent her photographs and she... And then she said, “I don’t know why You don’t write to me, I’ve been writing to You, this and that, I know it’s a difficult task to give a realisation”. “Oh” - so I talked to her - “Alright, when I come next in June you can come along”.

But there could be somebody who might be of that calibre, you can feel it, you are knowledgeable yourself, you can feel the vibrations, you can feel it and you can then take that person seriously. So work on the people who are simple, who have that calibre.

Of course, they could be very much spoilt also because of seeking, but if they are intense and sincere then the best thing is to work it out with complete assiduity and attention to such a person.

But if it’s a fashion, you see, because they are going to many gurus and they are doing some, lots of guru shopping, then you should say, “There’s no shop here, you can’t pay, first of all, you can’t pay”. If they understand that, then it’s alright. Say like one fellow from the BBC came in and he said, “We can’t believe in a guru who doesn’t take any money”. I said, “Then alright, you go to such a guru who takes money from you, I’ve nothing to say”. He said - what did he say? – “Anglo Saxon brain”. I don’t know what that brain is specially, made by God or not? (She laughs, laughter) Cannot understand anyone who can do such a thing without money.

Such a person you should say, “Alright, thank you very much, I’m sorry, you see, you are beyond me, you are too great, sorry”. Not hurting the person. But such ideas, such things if they have there in brains, you cannot break such a hard nut, can you? And you should not feel sorry for them.

First see their vibrations, see their calibre. Calibre is the only way you can judge how much attention is to be paid, what is to be done.

For some people it’s so obvious, so obvious. And some people go on arguing, arguing with you. But all of them now are good Sahaja Yogis despite the fact they argued quite a lot with Me to begin with; now they are very good Sahaja Yogis. But now time has come for you to have a quick result, and you will meet people who will be very good, I’m sure you’ll meet all of them who are in England and you, you will be able to manage them. Your ways, your methods, your styles will convince them.

Today, only, Doctor Brian has told Me that many people are getting interested now in Sahaja Yoga, because they can see the change that comes in, the transformation, the confidence, everything that they see.

So you should not try to force Sahaja Yoga on anyone; it’s better that you see their calibre. Calibre is very easy to make out.

You just say it and it is there. They know, yes, that’s it.

Any other question?

Yogini: Shri Mataji, please, could you talk about simpathy and compassion towards other Sahaja Yogis who have problems, who have some negativity in them, please?

Shri Mataji: I can’t hear. What’s it? Clearly, I didn’t hear. You also didn’t hear, I’ve seen.

Yogi: Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Ah.

Yogi: Could You speak about sympathy and compassion towards other Sahaja Yogis who have problems with negativity?

Shri Mataji: Ah. Now. Sympathy and compassion; sympathy doesn’t get involved, then it’s compassion. Sympathy. ‘Sym’ means ‘share’, ‘pathy’ means ‘pathos’ – if you want to share the pathos of another person then you are sympathizing with that person.

Now supposing, somebody’s husband is dead and that person is crying a lot and you also go and sit down and cry louder than her (laughter). Then people will ask you, “Did you husband die or her husband die?” (laughter). “No, no, I am just showing sympathy, you know” (Laughter, She laughs). This is lip sympathy, of course.

Another is – may be the heartfelt sympathy. When it is heartfelt then you don’t cry; then you develop the opposite force to put that person right. What do you say to that person?

You should say, “See, now if you are born you are going to die, everybody’s going to die, that’s, that’s the system. Now, two persons never die together. This gentleman who has died now, he’s your husband, alright, but now if you start crying like this, he won’t have any peace, he’ll be hovering round you, and he might be in limbo waiting for you to come there, or something like that. So no use crying over him, on the contrary, you should say, “I’m alright, don’t worry about me, I’m alright, get your realisation as I have got it”. This is the opposite force that you put. This is a real, real way of helping that person.

But the compassion is very different, compassion just flows, it doesn’t say anything. Even you don’t see Me, even if you are in the hospital, you know I am with you.

It works. Even if you just think of Me, it works.

Even if you make some mistakes, you know Mother will forgive. That’s compassion. Compassion is just flow, you don’t talk about it, you don’t say anything. It just flows and covers you completely. And you enjoy that. That’s compassion; it works - sympathy doesn’t work - compassion works, it soothes you. It’s a very beautiful touch of love, affection, kindness, protection. And you feel so confident that you are under the protection of the Divine.

So, this compassion has not to be shown or to be dealt with.

Now supposing, another Sahaja Yogi’s having a problem. We have only two problems; as I say, “How many turns there are in London? Only two, left or right” (laughter).

In the same way, they have two problems: either left or right. If it is the left one or the right one.

You know right one you have to beat with the shoes, that’s all, finished. You don’t have to go and say anything to the person, if he has right problems.

Now if he has the left problem what do you do? You need not go and talk to that person: give him a bandhan, you can burn the name, you can do what you like. But you need not face the person, you need not tell the person that, “I’m helping you, I’m trying to do something for you”. That’s wrong, that’s ignorance, you don’t have to say that; it just works, it has to work by itself.

But I don’t tell you that I’m going to help you in any way, do I? Nothing of the kind.

Wherever you are you know I’m with you, all the time. In the same way, this compassion will work whether you are sitting down here, if you are beating somebody with shoes that person will come round.

So they have only two problems, one is the left or the right. If you try to sympathize with any one of them you are in trouble.

So best thing is not to directly help them, but indirectly. Not to tell them that you are helping, not even mention it to them; the concern is the point, the concern about a person.

Your attention should go there, your attention is very active. It’s a very powerful thing you have got, your attention acts. Just put your attention to that person, with a concern, but no involvement: that is compassion.

You have got it, you have got the power of compassion in your attention now, you haven’t used it. Without taking any credit for it, without showing it, without confronting it, just inside yourself you feel it, it will work out.

But for that you have to cleanse your own attention, that’s very important. If your attention is loose type, if your connection is not alright, then it won’t work out. But if you have that kind of an attention which is silent, which is witnessing, which is not involved, it’s dynamic, it works!

All of you have to become like Me, I’m sure you all can, and achieve that calibre of compassion. Alright?

Do you follow now? Thank you.

Any other question, Hester? No? Danya has any questions? (She laughs) You never had them. Anybody else? Jason? None!

Question-less people, I tell you.

Best way is to enjoy others. Best way is to enjoy others; and to enjoy yourself is to laugh at yourself, that’s the best way.

Address yourself, “You, Mister, now come along, this is ego, I know (laughter). Ah, that’s it, that’s the one! No no no no no no no no no, not me! I’ve had enough of it”.

That’s how you enjoy yourself. And enjoy others, seeing their good points. Sweet, sweet things they do, very sweet things. You don’t have to say anything.

And we had 71 marriages, you can’t believe it. And I looked at the brides and they were all looking at Me from the angles, you see; and the eyes were telling the story of their love and gratitude, and I don’t know what all they said.

I was just watching them when they were walking with their garlands in their hands, slowly, slowly; the sweetness, the beauty of their feelings; very slowly they were walking. And then I saw the boys standing there, looking at Me with tremendous feeling of oneness.

You see, this cannot be enjoyed otherwise.

Even with the body you cannot enjoy, supposing you rub your hand, you won’t enjoy that much as you enjoy other people, other sahaja yogis.

And then the friends doing the leg-pulling also I enjoy (laughter), the way they talk to each other I enjoy, everything’s so enjoyable, it doesn’t hurt anyone, it doesn’t trouble anyone.

You are here to enjoy, God has created this universe for you to enjoy.

So only thing is that you must improve your attention, cleanse your attention by meditation, always think of good things, not of bad things. You should not react too much, just be within yourself, see for yourself, witness everything. And you’ll be amazed, you’ll see beautiful points, beautiful things all around you.

So much of beauty which we are losing because we cannot see it. So that deep, penetrating attention of concern will solve all the problems, I’m sure.

But ‘open your heart’ doesn’t mean that you go and hug somebody and kiss somebody ten times, it doesn’t mean that at all. On the contrary, it can be quite embarrassing, you know? (Laughter, She smiles, laughs) Any other questions?

I, I had a problem there, you see, we, they arranged a programme for Me to speak to the young presidents’ organisation, the presidents of big, big – of big, big organisations, business organisations, and I had to speak to them.

And one of the lady - of course, I mean - the questions were very good and everything flowing (?) over, and later on she says, “But I can’t believe it, because she is not at all serious, you see” (laughter, She laughs). And I laughed and laughed and laughed with that, I said, “Now I cannot be serious anymore, that was too much” (laughter, She laughs).

When there’s so much joy bubbling out, why, how can you be serious?

This is the idea of a saint that he should be very serious, stern, going out with a stick in his hand all the time hitting everyone on the head (laughter, laughs). So, any other question  (indistinct word)? No.

We must have a hall here, big hall we should buy somewhere, we should be able to buy.

I’m thankful to people who are working on Shudy Camp but I think you must hurry up now, people are coming for Guru Puja, I told them we’ll have it in Shudy Camp. And otherwise if it is not ready we’ll have to change the venue, so everybody must go and work it out, I think, is important. We have money, we have no problem on that.

We have to have a nice, grand, beautiful seminar before Guru Puja. And there are many coming here, you’ll meet all of them, will be a very nice time, real festival we’ll be having.

So it would be better that you, all of you combine together and work it out and also give different work to different people; and they should all try to organize it in a beautiful way that there’s no quarrel, nothing.

But you’ll see people, you see, will say, “Oh! This is the room I would like to have for my wife” (laughter), things like that. Sounds stupidity. “This is the glass for me, I can’t give it to you”. All such stupid things will be there, and I think, for such people you should say, “You are not for Guru Puja, better not be here”.

Everybody doesn’t deserve to be there. That’s you should find out, that what sort of people they are. If they are fighting for all these little, little things it’s best is to tell them that, “Sorry, you’d better not come for Guru Puja”.

So, the most important thing is that in Guru Puja we have to receive a special capacity to be a guru ourselves.

A special intelligence, a special understanding, a kind of a wisdom which gives you discretion and the ability to argue out things.

That will enhance your personality, a beautiful, dignified personality can be created within yourselves, so for that you have to be there with all that dedication and understanding about yourself.

So I’m looking forward to this Guru Puja, and everybody has to write. Now for Sahasrara day they are working so hard, the people from Australia have printed so many posters, all over the world they have sent it, they have sent it to you also the posters of Sahasrar Day - have you brought it? No? You haven’t shown them.

So next time you must show all of them, they should see that, what they have done, how much; and you must - we have no, nothing like a news from there and this thing - but all this can be discussed among yourself; and you should know about each other, what’s happening, where, and what ashram is doing, what is the special work they are doing, and what is the new thing they have discovered; all sorts of things you can find out from each other. And you can tell others also. This is how you keep in communication with each other.

Oh, there’s a very good news, that Doctor Rai, who is the Dean of the Faculty of Physiology in Delhi University, started a research work on the comparative study of Sahaja Yogis and others as far as the physiology is concerned. And he’s found out that the people who are not Sahaja Yogis have a very low resistance for diseases, their skin, skin resistance is less and so many things he’s found out. And he has put it on, he’s tabulated the whole thing, and that is been now approved by the Government and is now published, going to be published also.

In the same way, you see, we are thinking of having a research here done for people in Shudy Camp, so that we can also publish something like that with the research. That so far, you see, so many have been cured, so many got rid of their addictions, so many got rid of their mental problems, so many things happened; but we haven’t yet recorded it, we have not put it properly on the record.

Now this is what we are going to do now, anybody who has achieved something or has felt better or has been cured or something like that must give it in writing to these people so they record it, because, you see, in these modern times they want everything in black and white, so that could be done very well here in England.

Another thing I was thinking that now “Nirmala Yoga” has stopped there because of this problem of foreign exchange.

So what we can do is to have a “Nirmala Yog” published in India and sent here, and you can print it here and sell it here, so that the foreign exchange problem doesn’t come in.

Because foreign exchange is such a problem in that country, you have to have a proper committee, this, that, all headaches.

So you can sell them here and distribute them here, it’s very easy, and Paul can help you there. Paul, can’t you?

Paul: Yes...

Shri Mataji: Yes. So it’s alright. We get the “Nirmala Yog” done there and just the copy sent here, translated. You can also add to it, you can also put something into it and some things from there and some things from here; you can distribute it to all the centres here and we can start like that. Because they created a big problem out of that last “Nirmala Yoga”, so I’ve just stopped it, because you see we, we are not very good at human laws, I think, sometimes you make mistakes and I don’t want you people to be caught up into these human laws.

So you have to be careful. And we can do it, I think we can do it. And as England is the heart it has to circulate everything. But the hearts must open out. The conditioning is very bad here, you see, that you are told that you should not express your feelings, you should not say anything, you should be very poised, you should not talk about your feelings.

That’s not so in Sahaja Yoga. This is the heart and heart must speak, heart must say; you must know how to say that you love others. It’s very easy to say ‘I hate’, but it’s very difficult for people to say ‘I love you’. Because they are afraid, they fear that if you commit like this, “Oh, so you love me? So do this for me. You love me? So do this for me (laughter). How dare you say you love me, if you have loved me you must do all this and you must give this to me”.

Oh, we had some Sahaja Yogis like that. They were abusing Me also that, “You said you love us, then why don’t You do this for us?”. Then it becomes a demanding love.

Any other question anywhere? What’s happening, John, about your priesthood? [Shri Mataji laughs]

They are getting quite exposed.

John: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Exposure is the only way, but still nothing goes into the heads of the people, they are so egoistical, nobody wants to accept that it’s all exposed now within – ‘No, it is fanaticism, it is nonsense’. But still they go on with it, what to do?

(Mother looks around at the yogis then smiles) Beautiful children you have here. How many are new people who are seeing Me for the first time? Raise your hands please. Ah!

Ah, you all look little serious! (laughter, She laughs) Still rather serious. You shouldn’t be serious at all. Good. Nice. Get the children. He is just hitting the head. (She laughs) Who is the child crying there so much? Whose child? (A yogi says something inaudible) This child? What’s the matter? Must be hot. Take out the sweater. Eh?

(Somebody says something) It’s alright. I think, must be hot for the child. And they feel very thirsty also, you see, these are places where you don’t have any humidity much, so they feel very thirsty also in such places, I think.

(Shri Mataji listens to the baby who continues to cry)

All of them cry the same, whether they are Indians, English, anything! (Laughter) From their crying you can’t make out what race they come from. (Baby stops crying) Now better?

Have you got some water or something? See! You must understand your children, they won’t cry without a reason. They are all realised souls. Alright.

(Yogi hands Shri Mataji a glass of water)

Thank you, thank you very much. Anything else?

(Someone asks an inaudible question)

Shri Mataji: Can you say...?

Yogi repeats to Her: “How can you best cope if you have to work in a negative situation?”.

Shri Mataji: In your office?

Yogi: Job, yes.

Shri Mataji: Negativity in the office?

Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: You see, all the negativity have also, has also an aspect which I call is ridiculous and humorous; so anybody who is negative or anything you watch it, see for yourself, don’t get involved, just see which part it is, is it ridiculous or it is humorous (laughter). Then you won’t be serious about it.

Sahaja Yogis have a sense of ridiculous, you see, they understand what is ridiculous is; also they understand what is humorous or what is stupid. So just see that, it is stupid? Alright, let it be, doesn’t matter, what can you do?

These children are growing so fast, you know. They’re so becoming all tall, girls and all that. I’m just trying to make them out one after another. (She looks at a baby near Her)

[The following part is not on this video so could not be verified]

Feeling sleepy now.

Just sleep off. Sleep, sleep. You can sleep now with light, yeah, why? Just watching Me all the time, you see, despite the laying down (Shri Mataji laughs).

Anything else? Now this is supposed to be what? Brunch, dinner, everything put together. (Laughter) Wah. So wah wah.

I think we should say the mantras for three times, the Sahasrara mantras and then we can have this.

Put your hands like this (Shri Mataji shows her hands in meditating position) Straight. Hands should be straight.

[Yogis say the Three Sahasrara mantras]

There are certain routines I think we should follow because Hamsa is catching for the new  people and this is due to this dryness I think in the room there is dryness, in the places where you work there is dryness and in the house there is dryness. So must use this ghee for the nose. I think one drop in every nostril once in the morning and once in the evening would be good, because I can feel it in Hamsa, the drying out, the...

If you are getting also drying out in the throat and you feel that all the time there’s a kind of a coughing so the best thing for that is to put a few drops of ghee on hot milk or hot water and take that so the whole thing spreads here (Indicates the throat from left to right) and it makes it smooth. As you see our hands and all that needs some cream we need this for our _________ we can call it the epithelial cells which are lining and when this line becomes dried out then you feel very funny.

I mean the whole attention gets very upset so I think you should get try in London, it’s a good idea, to keep a bottle of ghee with you, and you can heat it in the water, hot water, just like you can hold it under a tap and it will work out, and then put two drops in the morning and two drops in the night, before sleeping it will be a good idea.

The dryness will go off and also in the ear I think we should put some sort of an Olive oil or something will be good idea, because all... I feel the dryness very much since I’ve come in London I can feel that you people have this dryness. That’s a very common thing and that can also solve your problem of hay fever and all those things.

Now for liver we have found out great things and I think I’ll now sit down and write all that is to be done for liver and we can circulate it to all the members what is to be.

It’s very, very simple things that you have to do it and if it works out them all your liver problems will be over.

Most of the diseases are there because of the liver so I think I should circulate that and it’s very simple, not much of medicine or anything but it’s very simple and it will work out.

This time it’s surprising all the Sahaja Yogis kept very good health on India tour, none of them had problem on the liver, nothing of the kind, surprising, every one of them.

So also it is connected, you see, with the flowing; if you have the cold which is all the time flowing and it’s sort of giving you sneezing and all that, you must know it is due to liver, It’s surprising! I hope the doctors will forgive me when I tell this, that you see when the liver gives the heat the phlegm in the body melts and gives these problems. When the phlegm melts, you see, you start getting the water flowing through your nose and also you get other problems like sneezing and also hay fever. All those things are from liver.

If liver is alright....that’s why it’s called liver because it’s connected with life... If your liver is alright you won’t have these problems, and that circulation we must send. (Looks at a yogi)

I think if you can come tomorrow sometime to write down all those things that are to be done for the two (?) and all those who... and also sort of your friends and all that you can tell them that for liver take this, it’s very important.

So, are you not going to sing a song tome? Who? Let’s be having! What about Bristol group?

You know I have an idea, I must tell you, I thought in India we can start a kind of Sahaja Disco! (Laughter) Nobody knows what you sing in a disco, isn’t it? But you can give them realisation secretly! And now In India they think that you are very great people to have discos and all that sort of thing. Disco is a very big thing (laughter)

So who’s going to sing? Where are the musicians? They’re all distributed all over. Let him sing, he sings very well Yah! Very good! He’s got it (Probably referring to Bernard’s guitar) I knew! (Bernard arrives with guitar).

(Possibly talking to Shri Mataji of previously crying baby) He’s alright now, see! (To Bernard) Where are your companions? Hmm! Let him come. Hello!

But he sings! I never knew. (Someone hands something to Shri Mataji) Oh God, that’s not necessary, just give it like that, in the hands, it’s alright, just in the hands, not good to eat a lot

So is there any restriction in this hall?

(Looks at watch) You can come in, Danya, there’s room there, just come along. Why are you standing all the time? You can come here. How is your mother? She’s here, is she? How’s her throat? I can’t see her. How are you Magda? Better? May God bless you (to Magda)

(Shri Mataji organizes a little table being placed in front of Her and tells yogis She can hold a plate in Her hand) It’s alright, it’s quite safe in My hand! Don’t you worry about anything else.

(To Cyril - older yogi from Birmingham) I think you can sit on the steps, it would be better for you, I know it’s difficult.

[Yogis start singing bhajan: “Om Bhur Bhuvah” ]

After Fergy’s.[Derek Ferguson] song – 3hr 14mins

Shri Mataji:

Thank you very much for such a nice song...such a laughing mood isn’t it..

Such a nice time, how the children and all the Uncles and Aunties sitting here nicely and enjoying each other’s love. Beautiful to see.

So, as I said, you are the future generation of the whole world. A generation of a new state of mind which is so beautiful and nice and let others also see it and join you in this enjoyment.

The Sahaj Yogis must learn to laugh and enjoy, if they cannot do it then there is something wrong with them.

Try to shed off all the conditionings and all the stupid things and all the obstinacy that we have, with our conditionings.

Just enjoy and enjoy and enjoy.

Of course as you know Sahaja Yoga respects all that is decent and decorous which is childlike and innocent.

All this was so enjoyable and fine, May God Bless you all.

Very nice to meet you again and I hope to see you again on the 11th, maybe before, much before that, I hope so I’ll be here.

Whatever it is, you have to make all preparations and render your help to the leaders so that there’s no problem and shortage of co-operation from you.

I expect that from all of you. All of you should come forward with whatever talents you have, use it.

Dancing, singing, poetry on one side, then cooking, serving then constructing, organising. All sorts of things are there, whatever your talent, should be used.

May God bless you all.

I think I’ve improved the climate all right, it’s so warm that I feel that I feel I’m in Poona.

So warm in the afternoon today, very warm. I thought the heater was on, but it was not.

Shri Mataji refers to a child:

Is that the same frock? Have you not grown? This frock fits alright I see, I mean are they growing

That means the frock is growing with you, that must be the reason..

Laughter

As Shri Mataji is leaving:

Yogis sing Mataji Mataji your face shines like a thousand suns

Conch and Shri Mataji ki Jai
