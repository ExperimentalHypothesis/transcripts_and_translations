 (England)
She was going to an interview down at Brighton. She said, "Go in and choose one of my saris. Which one should I wear?" And I thought, "Oh dear, this is universal. This is going to have repercussions if I don't get the right sari." There were two rows of saris going around three walls. And you think, "Which one do you choose?" because one's always better than the other. I thought, "I've always loved that one with the little orange things on it, the little dots."

I came out, and she must have thought I was taking so long because she had already gone into the bathroom. So I left the bedroom and sat outside to wait for her, because I hadn't told her which sari I'd chosen. But of course, she came out wearing that sari. Out of what must have been 700 saris in there, that was the one she was wearing. So just be carefulâ€”I do know what you think.

Amazing.

Thank you.
