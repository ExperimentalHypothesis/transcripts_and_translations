b'\nTalk to Yogis, Treatments, (Ghee, Olive Oil, Vests etc), New York State, (USA), 22/10/1983\n\nStarts at 1:32:00\n\nShri Mataji:  You must put some heated butter in the nose, all of you.\nSahaja Yogi: Inside?\nShri Mataji:  Inside, with a dropper, alright? Heat butter and fill it up. And then, when it is slightly warm, not very warm, absolutely slightly warm, then put it in your nose, very important, because the- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know in this country, people, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very simple thing to be done once in a while, about say two or three days later or even every day you do, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. It\xe2\x80\x99s like putting cream on your hands, you see, because the cold weather also chaps inside the lining of the nose. And when you put this, it makes the nose smooth and you don\xe2\x80\x99t get troubles of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s very simple. All of you should do, all the Sahaja Yogis are supposed to do. There are so many things that a Sahaja Yogis are supposed to do, one of them is this, that try to keep you Hamsa Chakra alright.\n\nBy keeping your nose alright you are keeping your Hamsa Chakra better. So better use this simple method of heating some ghee, we call it. You see, you can prepare it, heat the butter, keep it in a bottle with a dropper, and heat it in the hot water and then put it in the nose, just like that, in the night, before sleeping.\nEven in the ears, we must put olive oil. It\xe2\x80\x99s very important. For the teeth also, you must take some salt, put some olive oil and rub your gums. With that, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to the dentist anymore. That\xe2\x80\x99s the best, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to a dentist all my life, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to go to the dentist anymore. [Laughter]\nSo that\xe2\x80\x99s a very good way of rubbing your gums with vibrated salt and what you call the olive oil. Also you must oil your heads, every Saturday, with so much of oil, nicely, oil it, massage your head and sleep off and next day, wash up your hair. You\xe2\x80\x99ll feel very much better. If any of you cannot give olive oil the best is almond oil for the head. You\xe2\x80\x99ll keep very peaceful. \n\nSpecially your children, you must massage them till they\xe2\x80\x99re five years of age, every night, when they go out to sleep in the night, nicely very- before sleeping. And then put some powder, clean it out, let them sleep. Then the children won\xe2\x80\x99t be running and upset and all that. They\xe2\x80\x99ll become very quiet children, well-behaved children. Because you people don\xe2\x80\x99t massage the children, all their lives they are jumping. And all their lives they are slightly violent, you see, the nose must be smooth out. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very simple method and as you are Realised people you\xe2\x80\x99ll smooth them much more. All these small, small things must be taken care of, you see.\nNow if you have too much of cold, if you have too much of cold, then you can mix up with a bit of camphor, with oil, and put that in the nose, little actually, not much, that also is very good, that also smooth your cold and puts you right. This country has one big problem with Vishuddhi chakra everywhere in the West, because of the cold.\n\nAnd in Sahaja Yoga it is compulsory that you must wear an undershirt. It is compulsory. Whatever may be, it is hot, cold, in India when it\xe2\x80\x99s steaming hot, you must wear an undershirt, because, when it is very hot you start perspiring and that perspiration causes problems. So, always wear an undershirt, whether you are in a hot season or in a cold season. That\xe2\x80\x99s a compulsion for Sahaja Yogis that they must wear. \n\nAnd for all of them, also is compulsory that they should always wear a muffler when they go out in the winter time this is an important thing. And also put some cotton wool in the ears as I put it. For your sake I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you to put it cause you are careless, so I look after you but putting it to my ears like this. You all should put it before going out.\n\nAnd keep your head covered in the night, when you sleep, cover your head with something and then sleep. Because most of the time, your body is all covered, but the head is not covered. Because now you are Realised-souls and your Sahastrara is weak, so you must look after your Sahastrara. Cover your head so that you won\xe2\x80\x99t have any problem. Also you must verify what sort of a person you are. If you have a liver problem, you must get a diet for that, which is here, people will tell you. If you are left sided person, if you have left sided problems, then you must know about the diet that you have to take. \n\nFor example, a person who is a left sided should not take carbohydrates at all, on the contrary should eat proteins, in whatever form it is possible. In Sahaja Yoga you know we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in vegetarianism or anything, but we do believe that the muscles of bigger animals than us, are not good for our teeth, or for our body also because the structure of a muscular cell of a bigger animal is much bigger than ours. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how they heat up, I mean, even by mistake if I eat some beef, or anybody ask me, the other day, my cheeks were swollen up, so that\xe2\x80\x99s why it happens,  it is an automatic reaction.\n\nAnd we are not supposed to use plastics; in our clothes, also try to avoid. Some person, [?] plastic can be used but not all the time plastics and nylons. And also the food should not be eaten in plastics. You can eat it in paper, paper is alright because it is \xe2\x80\x93what you call- is wood, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. But you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat in plastic food, plactic with fork and spoon of plastic and it\xe2\x80\x99s too much plastic in this country, be careful because plastic is anti-God. It is anti-human life, it is anti-biological processes. So avoid plastic as far as possible, be careful on that. Also don\xe2\x80\x99t use, I mean, something out of absolute plastic like, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen I wanted to buy one pair of slippers for myself, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get one in the all of New-York. Because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a plastic. And if you wear that then you develop all kinds of skin problems and diseases, so be careful on that. There are so many other things we have to be careful about. And because we have found out that these things are harmful, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have made it compulsory that every one of you must be careful. Because now you have become the temple of God and the temple of God should be healthy. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want tubercular patients to go around as saints nobody is going to believe them. [Laughter]\n\nSahaja Yogi: Can you just tell us about sugar.\nShri Mataji: Ah. Now there is another falsehood about- thank\xe2\x80\x99s God it\xe2\x80\x99s now broken- that the sugar is against our growth and all that. Sugar is very important for attention, specially people who suffer from liver. For example, people who are thin, mostly, suffer from liver trouble. For them, sugar is so important, that if they don\xe2\x80\x99t take sugar, they\xe2\x80\x99ll become like the sugar cane which is, comes out of the machine, pressing machine, you see. [Shri Mataji laughs]\nThey\xe2\x80\x99d better take some sugar. Sugar is very important for your liver! Best carbohydrate is the white sugar, not the red sugar; red sugar is not good because it has got molasses, it\xe2\x80\x99s very heating. Some people have funny ideas here, also about food. Like, some of them believe, that if you eat natural food- and once I got something from natural store and I got diarrhoea for five days! Because it was meant for animals not for human beings.\n[Laughter].\nLike some people eat, what you call them [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi] cotton seed. Now cotton seeds we give only to animals. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Switzerland, they give cotton seed in the bread. There was cotton seeds in the bread, one or two is alright, but imagine [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi] \xe2\x80\x93 Laughs from Hindi speakers.\nI mean it has to be given to buffalos only! [Laughter] Like that, I was given a [inaudible]  You see, these are very strong things. In the same way, very soft food is also not good, we have to be in the centre in everything. Don\xe2\x80\x99t eat very raw food you see, like some of the bread in France you know, even in England we find, the bread cereals [inaudible] completely. So that kind of a crispy stuff is not needed. It should be such that your gums are looked after, there are delicate things, and have food which is good for you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go with rationality, don\xe2\x80\x99t go with the fashion, but whatever is good for you that should be done. And you find out about yourself, what is your temperament, what sort of a food will suit you, and accordingly you should eat.\nOf course, everybody is free to do what they like but we can only advise them that this will suit you and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find out it will be very useful to all of you, it will help you.\n\nFor your hair growth, also you should get vibrated oil and use it. Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised that day, somebody saw Warren and he said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the same fellow? He looks much younger\xe2\x80\x9d. So I said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d. he had a bald head from here to here like that and now he\xe2\x80\x99s grown hair. With proper care, you can have you hair quite intact, for quite some time, if you look after your hair.\nBut hair is very important is not so much the look, but it\xe2\x80\x99s Sahastrara. And if you put oil in your Sahastrara every week, you will have a smooth personality, a smooth behaviour, a smooth movement; you\xe2\x80\x99ll deal with other people in a gentle manner. So this is very necessary.\nIn India we actually have a big masseur attached to a family, you see, he\xe2\x80\x99s a very hefty fellow, and he comes to masseur [massage] the men, you see, and he just sits on their body and really finishes them off completely!\n[Shri Mataji laughs]\n\nAt the first shot, they\xe2\x80\x99re dead! Then he uses their body fully and pushes them and sits on them rub them with one clap! You see, five, six of them will be jumping on five, six people. With clap, they\xe2\x80\x99ll go round. By the time the second clap comes in, the person is finished! [Shri Mataji laughs]\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how, that\xe2\x80\x99s how they manage. But there is no importance on massage in here, you see. And don\xe2\x80\x99t ask a non Sahaja Yogi to massage you, never. Don\xe2\x80\x99t allow anybody to touch you that way because, you see, these people carry all bad vibrations and you may suffer. You must allow only the Realised souls to massage you, if possible, or you yourself should massage yourself. But don\xe2\x80\x99t go to these masseurs and people who are massaging all kind of people and they might be giving you some troubles.\n\nSo one has to be very careful about certain things and certain personal habits also which we have discussed. And you can ask Warren, he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you about it, which are very important for Mooladhara and all those things, which must be followed, whether you are in England, America, anywhere. These must be followed to keep yourself clean outside and inside.\nNow if you have any question.\n\nSahaja Yogi: I was only wondering about the kind of techniques that we should use when massaging the children. But I guess we can talk about that another time. Shri Mataji: I mean, anyway you use is alright, but always, you put it upwards, you see? The movement should be upwards, but use oil otherwise you pull up, you pull up their hair. So use oil to put it upwards. Sahaja Yogi: And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the Sahastrara. Shri Mataji: Sahastrara, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget. Sahastrara you must put lot of oil on children.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother we\xe2\x80\x99re gone need more hairdressers, people who can cut hair, who are Realised souls, cause they are touching our Sahastrara while cutting.\nShri Mataji: Yes. Otherwise you can grow, what\xe2\x80\x99s the harm?\nSahaja Yogi: We can grow our hair Mother?\nShri Mataji: Yes here, up to here [below the ears] you can grow and turn them round.\n[Laughter]\nShri Mataji: You see, you\xe2\x80\x99ll look like a philosopher, quite impressive.\n[Laughter]\nShri Mataji: But you should not be a funny looking person.\n[Laughter]\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s one thing very important you see. You have to, not to adopt some funny methods, you see? Like people have. Specially, nowadays, the fashion is to disable your hair and keep them absolutely disabled, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need of doing-\nSahaja Yogi: The hair must be up there, over the forehead.\nShri Mataji: Ah! It should be keep back over the forehead, don\xe2\x80\x99t cover your forehead or your eyes, never.\nSahaja Yogis: Agnya chakra\nShri Mataji: Ah. Agnya chakra. You must keep it open, you see, always open. You must have a centre path if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible, but keep the forehead open, this is important. You should keep the forehead open, it\xe2\x80\x99s very good for others you see, and don\xe2\x80\x99t cover your eyes with any hair. Many people have a habit of allowing the hair to come in the eyes and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have [inaudible]. Children also, never allow hair to come on their eyes.\n\nThen we have something for the eyes also, what you call Netranjan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have now anything, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good, simple thing, cots you nothing about- [Shri Mataji speaks aside] one cent of a dollar.\nSahaja Yogi: We have some, we can send them tomorrow.\nShri Mataji: Alright, they have some, they\xe2\x80\x99ll give you, which is to be applied first very carefully.\n[Laughter]\nBecause if you are not used to it, it will a little bit burn and the tears will start coming out of your eyes, it will clear your eyes. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised, with that, if you use it, you don\xe2\x80\x99t develop these bags [dark circles] and things like that. And the water flows out. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very simple thing.\n\nAnd for soap also, try to use natural soaps, better use, because here the soaps are such that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nSahaja Yogi: Paramolove Mother? Paramolove, I think that is about the only soap you can get here.\nShri Mataji: Yes that is good, Paramolove is good. It\xe2\x80\x99s very good.\n\nGap in the video\n\nShri Mataji: What to do, is to take a little oil, and heat with some clove, Cloves.\nSahaja Yogi: Cloves?\nShri Mataji: Cloves. And let the oil be a little bit cool down, when it is quite cooled down, nor burning out at all, but just warm, you can feel it, then put it in the ears.\nSahaja Yogini: Olive oil is better?\nShri Mataji: Olive oil is alright.\n\nGap in the video\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother can you explain to us the techniques of vibrated sugar and vibrated salt, by giving vibrations, I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand you see\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: You see, because God has given you vibrations, the power is flowing through you now, the vibrations are there. So whatever you get from outside is touched by so many people, so many people have created it and they have got a good mind or may be something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with them, best thing is to give them a bandhan before eating. [Shri Mataji turns tree times her hand]\nAny food you eat you must give it a bandhan like this three times, so your vibrations flow into the food and you get it sanctified. Or else, you can also use your hands for eating if you have washed your hands, then it\xe2\x80\x99s alright.\nOr else, if you are taking the water, you can just put your hands there, then it gets vibrated, then drink it. Because, the thing is, the vibrations have started flowing through your hands, but still have not spread to your body fully. You see my point?\n\n[Sahaja Yogi sing the song Jerusalem, the aarti, and say the 3 great mantras]\n\nH.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi\n'
