Just My kaajal.
All the married ladies have come here or not, yet.
Now, those who have done something can go back.´
Yogi: Please, when you have done it leave your place for the others.
Much bigger mirror [UNCLEAR]
because I got it for this only.
Right in the house.
Yogi: Yes. - [UNCLEAR]

Bangles are
Also blouse must be there.

Yogi: No.

Not everyone should come forward.
With both the hands.
May God bless you!
[UNCLEAR]
So, all the married ladies have been there or everyone has been or not.
Haan.
Everybody must get a chance... - [ALL CLAP]
That means you're Shalivahanas you are supposed to give the Mother.
Yogies: [ALL LAUGH]
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]
[UNCLEAR]
Now you do upside down.
[UNCLEAR]
This is such a luck you had there that you got these sarees
So now for this is.. next [UNCLEAR]
you have a very
happy married life
and
that also for your wives
they are married to you
Yogi: Shri Mataji - yes, Mother?
eh.. you should, eh.. you should become great sahaja yogini
and should join your hands.
And I must tell you about this Shalivahana dynasty - you can see it
worked out in a very wonderful way this time.
Because they invited Me -
where these people now which was destroyed by earthquake.
Another place called as
Srivenandgaon
and where eh.. the one dynasty the
one of the
eh.. king which ruled
in Ching
so we have seen the court there three years [UNCLEAR]
And the Nandgaon was
used by Shivaji's Mother's side
because they were hounded by
the eh.. by Aurangzeb.
They are called as Jadhavas.
Jadhavs.
The word comes from Yadav which was Krishna's vansh.
And eh.. so My mother comes from that family
And only Shalivahanas used to
only marry Jadhavas or Jadhavas would marry the Shalivahanas.
So now, these people invited Me there
and they have given Me a huge land.
They wanted to give Me first 176 acres of land
uhh, but I refused to take.
So, I just said give Me 11 acres for the time being
in My mother's dynasty
Yogi: A - My mother's place.
That is the place we are going to use to establish our
all projects.
Yogi: - for the village development also.
And the other one the
one in My father's place is 300
acres of land
and his own, whole place where he lived - they want to give all that to Me.
So, that place which is a
the place where they lived, you see , I would like to use it
for a music academy
in the name of My father -
for all our sahaja yogies to learn music.
And I don't know what to do with the 300 acres so you better give Me idea.
Now, we've got another 30 acres of land
near Neera that you've got.
Then we have got another land
in Poona itself that she has given it to Me personally.
Then we have got another land, near Karzat, about 7 acres 
Ah.. now, there's one already we have
eh.. been given by the government
1 acre of land in Sitkorni at Bombay.
And one land we had, very beautiful one, of 1 acre of land
uh.. they were giving us
but then they discovered that if they give us this land
ah.. the, the gentleman, who is the owner, will get about 500 acres of land free.
so, they're demanding now give us atleast 10 acres of land for us.
[MOTHER LAUGHS]
Yogi: This I
Chief Minister of Maharashtra is anxious to give us the land whatever is given to us.
And now, in Delhi also, they have given us a 750
square yards of land. - in Delhi city.
So now, that's all.
[ALL LAUGH]
Yogi: We're still to do something with it, Mother. - Now we've got the land.
This year was the land year -
next year will be the building year.
So now, we have eh.. converted all your money into gold
and I can raise the price of gold.
[ALL EXCLAIM AND LAUGH]
[EVERYONE CLAPS]
Yogi: Om Twameva saakshaat Shri Kubera saakshaat
Yogies: Shri Adishakti Bhagwati Mataji
Yogies: Shri Nirmala Devi namo namah.
Yogi: He gave You Your beautiful nose, Mother.
[MOTHER LAUGHS]
Alright, now
So beautiful!
[UNCLEAR]
Give some [UNCLEAR]
But, only thing I would expect uh.
foreign sahaja yogies, all of them,
have to donate
51 pounds each, in this year, that's all.
or a gold coin so we can,
I can raise the price. - Yogi: [FRENCH]
Eh. that is the not very difficult, I hope,
and if it is difficult for some
it's all right but - Yogi: [FRENCH]
you see, Indian sahaja yogies
have got 8 lakhs
and Delhi sahaja yogies have got 6 lakhs.
Bombay sahaja yogies 8 lakhs - 6 lakhs.
So, it doesn't look nice from all of us to give
only
and the garland [YOU KNOW?]
So, I personally think that you should try to collect 51 pounds each
and you give them the account we have, together.
Now do the aarti.
Light is not there.
