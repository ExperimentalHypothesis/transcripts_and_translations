Sahaja Yoga, Kundalini, and Chakras - Mumbai, 30 January 1978 

What is Sahaja? Most of you already know. Guru Nanak Sahib has made great efforts and written much about Sahaja. It is a great blessing upon you all. However, no one knows about it, no one understands. 'Sahaja' means 'Sah' - together, and 'Ja' - born. It is born with you, it is born within you. The right to this yoga is born with you. Every human being has the right to attain this yoga. But you are human then! If you become an animal, you are deprived of this right, or if you become a demon, you are also deprived of this right. If you are a human being in the ordinary sense, then you have the right to attain this yoga. This is the only yoga; there is no other yoga. All other yogas are preparations for it. Some also understand Sahaja Yoga to mean straightforward, simple, effortless, spontaneous, because it is a living happening. Just as your birth, just as residing in your mother's womb, just as trees laden with flowers, transforming into fruits. Similarly, this is a profound, natural, spontaneous event. And this event, which is, is the ultimate pinnacle of human evolution. Humans are created by the Divine from animals. Do you know why a human is created from an amoeba? All scientists should sit together and ask, what is the reason after all? Imagine I gather a few pieces of wood and bring a round object and attach a stick to it. So anyone would ask, brother, what are you doing? Who are you doing it for? Anyone would ask an engineer, if they sit and make something, it's for someone's work, for utility. There would be a crazy person sitting there just attaching things together. Any sensible person is created for some reason. So, a human being is created by the Divine for some reason. But until I don't connect it with this main thing, it becomes useless. It serves no purpose. It's absolutely useless. There's no benefit in using it because there's no connection from it. These are all wise words, purely common sense talks. There's no need for anyone to learn to read and write this. If anyone from the village comes and asks, 'Brother, how does this light up?' You'd say, 'Come on, brother, press that button and the light will turn on.' So, initially, he would be amazed to see how that happened? It's a remarkable thing. It seems impossible. But then, upon seeing it, one feels, "Yes, brother, it's true." Similarly, it's the case with Kundalini as well. Indeed, it rises just by pressing the button. There's no doubt. But behind it, there's a complex engineering involved. How much extensive engineering is behind it? Centuries of hard work have been put into it.

After starting, it will rattle for a while and then stop. But if you don't know how to drive the motor, don't know its components, don't operate it, then you won't even know if there has been any movement within you. The motor may be standing there, but it needs to be in motion. There must be movement inside it. Now everyone, sit here with your hands like this. I will explain to you what Kundalini is. This diagram in front of you is made by a very advanced Sahaja Yogi and a great artist. He speaks to mute boys. He is a very simple person. He is a teacher in the municipality. And he has made this with great love. And look how beautifully he has made this painting. And all the colors used in it, everything has been made by touching my feet, vibrating, and working hard. This is also very important. Now what is in it is triangular; this is Kundalini. When a human is in the mother's womb. This system of rebirth, of enlightenment, which I said applies to men. Or what I say you guys are like a computer. And until you don't connect to the main, your computer won't say anything. Similarly, it is for the human race. Now what is shown in it is that when a child is in the mother's womb, then it enters from inside. But not only that, it doesn't just enter from above, where the child's fontanel is, which we call the fontanel bone, from there you can see this triangular structure that is made, that is your brain. The human brain becomes triangular. The animal's brain is flat. So from above, Kundalini descends and sits here. And besides this, these two powers are here. These two powers are the right side and the left side. These are two channels - Ida and Pingala. Ida is on the left, and Pingala is on the right. These two channels flow within. Now if I explain this in science, then understand that there is an autonomous system within us that controls our heart, digests our entire food, means it digests for us. It automatically does things within us in the body, it is our breathing activity. What we call the autonomous nervous system is what does our breathing activity. If someone is asked what auto means, what is automatic, who is this self? No one can answer that. No doctor. Doctors will say that we call it automatic. Saying so does not explain anything. They do not have an explanation. This autonomic system has two types of systems. One is called parasympathetic, and one is called sympathetic. This thing that is visible from above stays in the subtle form in our spine and operates the parasympathetic. And these two systems operate the left and right sympathetic nervous system. But I have told you about these channels in subtlety. These are external, gross. Now I am surprised... as if someone has written a book on Kundalini. And what does he say, Kundalini is in the stomach. Those who have seen it with their own eyes can tell that it is in the triangular bone. Now he has written this. He has written such a big book, so who would argue with him now? He has been dead for many days now. Yet he sits alive and keeps telling about Kundalini, the sixty-seven talks. But it's not like that at all. Actually, what is, it. What happens by writing lies? Anyone can write thousands of books.

There's a lot of falsehood written. Understand this. What has been written is not the Quran. Not everything is the Quran, nor is it in the vibrant Gita. There is a lot of falsehood written in whatever has been written. Even in our scriptures, people have tried to insert falsehood because falsehood always attacks, you know the truth. And for this reason, what you see within yourself, what happens to you, what event occurs, know that... came from reading someone else. Kundalini is not like that. If it doesn't exist, then how can we do it, brother? If you read somewhere that the color of a rose flower is blue and say, "Sir, this is not a rose flower because its color is not blue." So what should be said to such people? What should be explained to such people, you tell me. 'They said.' Do you know them? No. Then you bought a book. How many? Two rupees. Then? I read it. It says this, Ma'am. Then why do you do this? Now should I tell you that he is a liar? If I say so, you will chase me down and beat me to death because you immediately become his lawyer. Did you read the book? What book did you get? You become the lawyer for that book seller and it hurts me that, Mom, this is not the case at all. You are just saying this. It means I become a liar. He becomes true because you bought it for two rupees. Did you make any guru? Now whatever the Guru Maharaj said became true for you. Brother, did he do anything for you? Did he get you realization? Did he do anything with you? Nothing. He just sits on the seventh floor. He gave me a name. Oh, I said, 'Bhai, the one who gave you a name didn't see anything in you.' 'No.' I feel like I'm having a heart attack, Mom, so I came to you.' I said, 'Why don't you tell him then? Why come to me now?' He doesn't even look at you to see if you're having a heart attack or if you're sick or in pain. What conduct is to be expected from such a guru? There are many gurus whose disciples are having heart attacks. Oh, if the guru himself suffers from a heart attack, your health deteriorates, your mind becomes disturbed, your wife goes crazy, everything is chaotic at home, there is no stability here, and itâ€™s not the place of Lakshmiji. What conduct should be expected from such a guru? Why are you following him? What did you gain from him? Thousands of people are running after him, so we are also running. If everyone is a fool, then you are also a fool. This is also a matter of thought. Everyone should think why we consider him a guru. Another believes, means, why should we believe in him? God has given us freedom. And we have realized it in our freedom. There are many such gurus, like those transgender Maharajas. They give you a name, and you go into trance. You think you have become a very big person because you have been given the name of some ghost. You take the name of the ghost. They leave. Its okay, you have become very big. You drink alcohol, keep women, eat whatever you want, torments others in any way, and aggress, nothing else. Just, you have become a holy man. Why? Because so-and-so guru kept four women, I kept ten, so what happened? No relationship with the guru remains because of his religion, humanity, his human element. This is a strange spectacle. And people believe in it. Such gurus are very pleasing to them. Oh, we have a man here. You must have heard his name. Foreigners are bowing at his feet. I said, "why do you want them?" You have done all the drama. You're just his guru's pawn. What will you learn from him? People are clever. What is this talk about sex? What are you going to learn from him? You're the ones who should be learning from him; instead, you're making him your guru. But only because he's a conscious keeper. Because they haven't become demons yet. They think we are doing such dirty work. Christ didn't do this work, and we are doing these dirty deeds in the name of liberation. So, make someone a guru, take his certificate and go. The guru will sit in hell, and you will follow him there too. Such gurus are very pleasing to people who say yes, brother, you are a very good man. Wow..Haha! No one is bigger than you. Put your purse here. Your wife can't handle you, so send her home too. I'll do all your work. There are also such gurus in the world who says, give all your money, wealth to the ashram, and you will be enlightened. How can gurus who keep an eye on others' money be? First thing is money. And you also like such gurus because you think you are wealthy, from Delhi, earn money with both hands. Some people even earn money negatively, under the table. So, they also have arrangements. The guru has also been raised. Let's go, brother, the guru is ours too. So, we have fixed our next life. And this life is also fine. The guru doesn't say anything. He's a very decent man. In Jakarta, another guru was found. Sindhi people came to Singapore in Jakarta. Mother, save us, I said, 'What happened, brother?' They started saying, 'Our guru has drowned our boat.' I said, 'Why?' They started saying, 'He's sitting comfortably in Switzerland.' I said, 'Okay!' They said, 'We used to smuggle before. All our stuff was caught in Jakarta.' I said, 'That's good. Don't do that.' They said, 'No, our guru said to do it, and he told us some ways.' I said, 'Okay!' And they are sitting in Switzerland.

So, such gurus who want to exploit, this is not their place. I humbly fold my hands. Even if I have only two disciples, I have no problem. Those who seek truth should come here. The first thing, those who don't want truth and want to run after falsehood, should kindly take their leave. But you are searching for truth. I am ready to work hard and ready to do everything. Respect is earned by standing up for truth. God cannot be pleased with such a person. One thing over another. Deception and such things don't work here. Whoever truly seeks their salvation, wants their well-being, we are here to serve them because we are your mother, and we won't lie to you. We won't support any of your lies. You guys shouldn't take it badly. We'll tell you with extreme love won't give you grief, won't insult you. But you'll have to listen to what we say. We'll make you transcend on this condition and move forward. And you'll have to get realized and give it to the world. Like no one puts a lamp under the bed. It will go out. It should burn in oxygen. Similarly, whoever gets realized will have to give it to others. | Just like we were telling a story just now. A woman came to me. So, bring her to me. In five minutes, her eyes were fine. She was blind. She was brought to the hospital. And in five minutes, she started to see. That's reality. And Subramanyam had said, "I'll just drive and get you there." They had come as drivers. They transcended, and this girl also got better. After that, Mr. D.A. also worked hard. After that, he got dizzy. I said, 'Brother, do you want to find diamonds, pearls? What do you want?' If you want diamonds and pearls, then quit your job and you will find diamonds and pearls. Do some other business. Rob, steal, that's good too. But why are you going to this magician? You can't see from his face what kind of person he is? Haven't you heard me? They were just saying that she's dying. She's a young girl. She's not more than thirty-five. She's dying now. Her throat is choking. Let's go, mother, let's save her. Now tell me, should I leave all of you and go to save her? People have heart attacks. You should think about what your guru is doing? Real gurus recognize a fake guru beforehand. Those who spoil your Kundalini. What kind of guru is the one who blocks your path? Even if you can't transcend, you won't leave him, you'll keep holding on, keep holding on. Now 132 boys and girls have come to me in London. And they all say, 'There is a blockade in our head.' Mother, I don't understand what blockade is? They also have a treatment. Mohammad Sahab has given many treatments for such villains. Nanak Sahab has also given treatments. And they recovered with the same treatment. So you guys also understand, that you want truth, you want reality, you want to get realization. We have to know our existence. We have to release the hidden treasure within us. Look at their disciples. You guys should look at the disciples. Are their disciples practicing religion? Are they very honest people? One says our big; our attention is focused at that time. I said, okay. They sit for three hours. I said absolutely lazy business. If you don't want to do business, then my guru has initiated me.

I am sitting for three hours. The children are crying. My husband went to the office without eating. You have found a great business. My guru has initiated me, given me a name, and I am sitting here. If inactivity were a sign of religion, then why did Lord Krishna come here with the Sudarshan Chakra in his hand? He could have sat somewhere inactive and gone to some jungle. He would have gotten married and his wife and children would not have been taken care of. Is this a sign of religion? And they started saying that our guru has initiated us. Don't eat this, don't eat that, don't do this, don't do that. Yes, alcohol is definitely something. It's forbidden for alcohol. Alcohol, cigarettes are forbidden because you know that cigarettes cause cancer. Were all those people crazy who prohibited it? Alcohol is definitely prohibited. Alcohol is prohibited because alcohol goes against your consciousness. It goes against consciousness. Drinking alcohol disturbs your consciousness. Your liver gets damaged. Your mind is in your liver. If your mind gets damaged, your realization will be finished. This is against human beings. Completely demonic, believe me. Someone from Andhra Pradesh asked a question just yesterday. I went to Andhra Pradesh a year ago. I have four tapes, listen to them. And the ones who took them away are here. They came yesterday. And they will come again in a while. Ask them. I told them, 'Don't use tobacco here. Guru Govindji once went to a tobacco field, and his horse ran backward. They asked, as if tulips were planted in Holland, and everyone came with big motors to take me away. I laughed. I said, "It would have been better if you had come in a bullock cart, but you came with religion." They send tobacco from there for all over the world. How much sin must have accumulated, oh my! I said, "Just uproot it and throw it away." So they started saying, "What to do?" I said, "Grow cotton here, tell someone, sow crops in the tobacco fields. The cotton here will be very good. You sow" One or two heard. The rest got so angry that they didn't even send me a letter saying, "Mother is very bad, she's saying this and that." Alright. Now see the situation. All the fields were flooded with water. I had said that one day the sea will rage against you. What is the sea? It is directly the form of the father, the Guru. He is the real Guru, he teaches. And against the Guru sits alcohol and cigarettes. That's why it's forbidden. And the third thing, which is very bad, is gambling. We have a fellow practitioner. Everyone around here plays cards. Women have also become addicted. They got up in the morning, distributed coffee, and party started. Cards started playing. Now she got addicted to it. I went to her, "Fix this." For a day or two, I thought I wouldn't tell her. It hurts a lot. Should I do this, should I do that? I said, "Look, you play cards." She said, "Yes." And you also bet money. She said, "Yes." I said, "Promise me you won't touch it again." Playing cards is not wrong, but if you indulge in competition over money, then you are disturbing your mind. It's straightforward to understand. Now, understand, we are sitting here talking to you with pleasure. You are our friend. As soon as friendship comes with the force of money, friendship ends, doesn't it?

Whether it happens or not, tell me. Any relationship, good or bad, is it true or not? Break any good relationship by arguing over money. It will happen immediately. Until you argue over money, friendship remains, doesn't it? This is the subtle point. That's why if you're playing cards, if you're playing for friendship, it's okay. There can be big enemies here. More than enmity, nothing can happen. How many people's sighs, what about them? Leaving small children at home, women are playing cards here. Why did she become a mother? Confusion is created. Sitting in the forests, all are playing tricks. They fight amongst themselves. Who asked them to come as mothers to these children? Then their children also become mischievous. People have become mischievous, drunkards, stubborn. What have I come here to do? There is a lot of emphasis on this in Delhi. Punjabi people think that until they don't play cards, they are not from Punjab. It's very sad. The Nanak who was born on this great earth, the direct incarnation of Dattatreya. He was tormented so much while alive, enough, enough! And now when he's dead, now everyone becomes Punjabi and you all know him. You will keep doing the same things that will cause him extreme grief, what will you say then? What's so easy about taking birth as a human being, who incarnated in the form of his father, who took birth in the world for himself, it's not easy at all, how much effort we are making. Now I have told you what things I am forbidding because I am a mother, I will forbid. If you put your hand in electricity, I will say son, don't put your hand in it. And you should understand that as much as a mother's heart breaks, it cannot break for yourself. So don't take my words badly. For your well-being, for prosperity, only a mother can work hard. There are so many realized souls in the world that you don't know about. There are so many enlightened souls sitting in the forests, sitting in the Himalayas. They come to meet me, I ask them what they are doing sitting there. What should I do with you all? What respect should I show you there? What should I do? Why are you sitting there? They say, "Mother, we will work hard for twelve years. Then we will come. There are very bad people there. We won't come." If you send someone to them, they break their legs. They say, "These are very cruel people, absolutely useless people, nothing can happen to them. Let them die for years." They say such things. It's you, there is so much courage in you, there is so much love in you that you are working so hard for them. Those who came, they started beating them. They took sticks and started chasing them. These are the same pandits who are sitting in the temples today and eating your money. They have killed so many. And these popes who roam around, they have crucified Christ and are still doing it. And you are going to their feet. What will they do? What is the need to go to people who walk on blind faith? There are many injustices happening, what I can tell you that I see. When will people's eyes open? Kabir said this much. He kept an uninterrupted recitation. Everyone is sitting there. It means to keep an uninterrupted recitation. If you listen to it with your mind turned towards it, you won't be able to listen. How will you understand, brother, by doing such things? And what has been said just does it.

Keeping it doesn't work. Everything has been said. Everything has been revealed. And what is natural has been there for many years, since creation. It's just that today Sahaj Yoga has reached a point where your connection can be with that primordial source. Sahaj has been operating in many ways. When the earth was first created, when it was cooled and heated, when life was formed within it, and then when living beings came. When humans came. Everything happened naturally. Krishna's Raas Leela, breaking the pot, everything is Sahaj Yoga. All the work of Prophet Muhammad also remained Sahaj Yoga. Everyone has been doing things naturally. Today Sahaj Yoga has reached a point where here, your common mass, collective realization needs to happen. This was necessary. But today, the historical time has also come. Historical time has to come. That has come. When the time comes, the flowers also blossom. When the time comes, spring comes. Similarly, understand that earlier only one flower used to bloom; today the time has come for many flowers to bloom. It was necessary, it was historical. You were given promises. And when one person transcended, they used to catch him and beat him because his words were not understood. But when today thousands of people get realized, everyone will understand their words. Now what is this Kundalini? No one has explained it so clearly yet. Christ said, "I will appear before like tongues of limb." Now go ask the Christians what that means. No one knows. Kabir Das, Guru Nanak, everyone mentioned these concepts like Ida, Pingala, Shunya Shikhar, etc., in their poems. But it remained a secret because at that time whoever said that was killed for it. And for openly speaking and understanding, humans did not have as much intelligence before. However, you will be surprised that today that intelligence is more prevalent. No matter how much a person seems fallen, their intelligence has increased. If someone gave a lecture in Krishna's time while sitting in such a gathering, would anyone listen? That's why Gopi had to enact the drama. They had to break their pots and pour the water from the Jamuna over their Kundalini. All this drama was done because at that time, sitting and discussing like you do today was not possible. Yes. But today you people are sitting like this; there is a lot of emphasis on exploration within you. And due to this reason, Sahaja Yoga has borne fruit in many countries. Especially in London, Sahaja Yoga has gained a lot of momentum. The reason is that the English were quite wicked; there is no doubt about it. They were there. But their children are very good. Their children are truly ascetics. And they have done very deep exploration. As a result of that, they have done very deep exploration. Even to the extent that they have started smoking marijuana. You sent a lot of marijuana from here, didn't you? They made them smoke marijuana. They did it. They were ready to do anything for exploration. And they are so educated that they know everything about Kundalini. And they also knew whether something is right or wrong, as soon as they found the truth, they caught hold of it immediately. You will be surprised that in my London, there are only four lecturers. Only four, in total. Right now, three hundred excellent Sahaja Yogis are ready there, excellent. Because the preparation was there. Dry wood catches fire quickly. Someone was saying at the airport to ignite the flame among the mothers and children. I said, "Son, this is wet wood. It has to be dried first, it requires effort. When the sunlight comes, then it will dry. In the sunshine of love, when these dry up, they will blossom somewhere. Nothing is easy. Therefore, keep yourself in the love of the mother. Love yourself. And think about everything with an open mind. This Kundalini that is within us, resides in the three and a half coils, that's why it's called Kundalini. Kundal means the thing that is coiled. What we call as serpent-like here. When the serpent sits, the coiled Kundalini remains seated like a serpent. In Marathi, it is called 'Vetole'. 'Vetole' is a very good word. It's something that coils and climbs up one after another, this is Kundalini. You can call it a coil. There are three and a half coils within one. Now why three and a half? The reason for this is that if you see an automatic watch. Which keeps running with a pendulum? Even in that, you have to put three and a half coils. There is mathematics involved. It's infinite, that's why it happens. Now if I go into its details, it will become a thing. But whatever is thought, that's engineering first class. There is no doubt in it. Now the Kundalini of three and a half coils has been placed here, this is the middle sprout. This is called the 'premula' in English. Below it, this chakra is already made. It has four petals. This chakra is called the Muladhara Chakra. Not just Muladhara, it's called the Muladhara Chakra. And this triangular place, where the mother is seated, this is your own mother. Everyone has their own mother. Understand, it's your tape. Your mother knows everything about you, so it's your tape, understands. Each one has a different mother.

And this is repeatedly born with you. Wherever you are born, it is born there. You cannot touch this Kundalini in any way. You cannot awaken it in any way. Standing with your head high, reading, writing, nothing can be done by anyone. 'Neither in yoga nor in Samkhya'. The best is our Adi Shankaracharya. He said that yoga and Samkhya will awaken by the grace of the mother. Because its mother, until she comes into the world, it does not awaken. Sometimes, due to the love of the formless, some people achieve it. And therefore, they remain formless. Mostly, they talk about the formless. Like you can say about Buddha. Once Buddha was tired and sitting, then the Divine Power itself awakened him, and he got realized. So, he said that there is no God because when you transcend, you feel cool and you transcend. You look a bit whether there is God or not. I am telling you whether there is God or not. The reason for this is that when Kundalini rises from subtlety to the top, it passes through inside. The external matter does not show anything to it. When the mind enters from the utmost subtlety inside, the external matter does not show anything. Just like right now you are sitting, what do you know about the outside? Delhi will only show you a little. If you come by airplane, you will see the whole of Delhi. But if you are inside the house, then only the house will be shown to you. Its external part also does not show. Similarly, when Kundalini rises from subtlety, no external means show you anything. You also do not know whether there is God or not. Only coolness starts to come from within you. The waves of consciousness come and go. You can see the effect of this. Now, your mother is here, and I can tell you everything, I can also give you proof of this. Now, in this Muladhara chakra, Lord Ganesha resides. The meaning of Lord Ganesha is, it is a symbol within us, a symbol. What is the symbol of? Of innocence. Of innocence, of purity. When the mother created this creation, before creating the whole creation, she created purity in the world. Any mother, when her child is about to be born, will clean everything in thousands of ways so that her child does not get dirty anywhere. Any mother, whether she is illiterate, whether she is (un clear), whatever mother she may be, will first create a clean place for her child so that her child does not come under attack from anyone. This is a sign of her motherly love. So, she created Lord Ganesha here. She placed purity at the door. And those who say that Kundalini is awakened through sex are suggesting having sex with their mother. At least understand this much, being an Indian. English people cannot understand. They have no mothers, no sisters, only donkeys. You should understand whether you should believe such a thing if Rajneesh explains it this way. Tell him to stay with his mother. We don't need to talk such dirty things. Understand how big a demon he is now. The awakening of Kundalini, which a person says happens through sex, nothing happens. When a person does such wrong deeds, any person who is very sensual and who has not respected life in the world. Who has done very dirty deeds and then starts talking about Kundalini, then Lord Ganesha gets angry with him, and then he starts dancing, then he starts screaming, he will rise suddenly in the middle, create havoc. This happens when there is a disturbance in the Kundalini. The Kundalini will never do such a thing on a true character. Kundalini itself does nothing. It's just your mother. It's for your blessings, for your rebirth. She doesn't do such things. But Ganesha gets angry. Tantric people have taken great advantage of this. Although I will say that a mother will never completely condemn her child's actions. Perhaps this is why a mother never completely condemns. It's the nature of a mother. I would say that a person must have seen Lord Ganesha at his Muladhara chakra. He must have only seen His trunk. So he might have thought that this is the Kundalini. And that's why he messed up. It's possible. Therefore, fundamentally, at the beginning, any mistake that might have occurred, it might be that according to my nature, a person is not condemned. But when they saw that by doing this kind of work, strange achievements are obtained within us, then they thought that this could be the power. Now how do achievements happen? When you perform wrong actions, especially on any chakra, as you can understand, a temple of Lord Ganesha, tantric did this. It's shown in a temple in the south that Lord Ganesha has a dirty relationship with his mother. They did this too. Tantric people left nothing. If you sit in front of or inside the temple of Lord Ganesha and commit adultery, then first of all, you will feel very hot inside you. A lot of blisters will appear inside you. You will suffer some kind of major discomfort.  Some people will start dancing, some will start jumping, and there will be discomfort. Yet you did not listen. Keep doing what you are doing. Forcefully, what they call negative tantra will start. Meaning, Lord Ganesha will leave that place. His consciousness will leave the temple. They will leave. As soon as Lord Ganesha leaves, impurity will enter, from both sides, see, these two sides are connected. The sympathetic nervous system on the left and right side, like this. From the left side, because you are looking at the left side. On the left side, there is the whole collective subconscious, and on the right side, there is the whole collective supera-conscious. From there, as many deceased spirits are there, from there, whoever the mind desires can come and you can achieve all the achievements of the world. Meaning, you can also tell the number of a horse. Idols can come out of your hands. Kumkum can come out of your hands. Etc. Now a person should think that they have intellect. A person should think, what interest can God have in giving us a diamond ring? Do you really want a diamond ring? Then you don't want it. Then why take it? And then you should also think that why don't those people who give such diamonds, why don't they do all the welfare of their country? What does it mean to give diamonds to rich people, who have big cars? Kabir Sahib has written a lot about this too. Nanak Sahib has written a whole chapter. These are all such things, making such appearances, pulling such faces, taking the intestines inside, etc., which are useless things, they have also written many things about them, that by doing this, one gets closer to God. But who reads them? Nowadays, people only read Rajneesh because if they get to see a cabaret dance by taking the name of God, then why not go? That too for free. The human behavior has become like this. That's why this is happening. So when we think that this person has achieved success, we start following him. When we start following him, Lord Ganesha disappears from within you. Mostly, when Lord Ganesha disappears, diseases of the prostate gland are prepared. Look at the other side. We are talking about indulgence here. What happens on the other side? Just today, a gentleman came. He is a very good man. A pure man. He worshiped Lord Ganesha here. He kept Lord Ganesha. He worships him morning and evening, and his Muladhara chakra is activated. There is another gentleman. He is our very strong co-yogi. He came to me. He is a very heavy devotee of Lord Ganesha. He is going to have an operation on his prostate gland. It was Sankashti day. I didn't ask him anything. I said, 'Take, son, eat chickpeas. Our chickpeas are prasad, you know.' So the other gentleman who was with him started saying that he is fasting today. I said, 'Fasting? On Sankashti day? Who told you?' He said, 'Everyone says.' I said, 'Everyone says. Think with your mind, on the day when Lord Ganesha was born, on the day when purity came into this world, on that day will you fast? What respect are you showing him? When a big man comes to your house, how much do we celebrate? Serve this, serve that. And on the day when Lord Ganesha comes to your house, you are fasting. Think about it. Is that day for fasting or for celebrating?' So he understood. He was a very wise man. He is a Brahmin. A very big Agnihotri Brahmin. They used to perform yajnas long ago at his place.

But wisdom prevailed, and said, 'Mother! Give meâ€™, and everyone ate chickpeas. Since that day, except for that, you will be amazed to ask them, I live in Pune. His prostate gland was completely healed, and he did not undergo surgery. If a person remains moderate, does not indulge in extremes, then everything will be fine. Who says, "Take your pain and spread it all over the world?" They will create havoc. They will pull out the intestines in anger. Oh brother, why do it? Ask those sitting here. Just three years ago, I treated them. Their intestines used to come out in front of me. I said to them in alarm, "Brother, don't come in front of me for two years. When your pain will stop, then come for the show." They used to perform such acts in front of me that I wouldn't even ask anything. Who told them to do all this? Are they wrestlers or trying to become cinema actresses? Relax. Yes, don't overdo it. Don't eat too much. Don't die of hunger either. Be normal, live like householders. Ask them, they will tell you how they are. I treated them for three years, their bones, only then they got better. Their condition is bad. So, there is no need to go too extreme. Hatha yoga is not for worldly people. Hatha yoga, go to the forests, where there is a guru, reach there. There should be a guru, not just a guide. They brought you, his stomach was so big. They brought Hatha yoga here. Because when these people go to any guru, nothing works, so they bring yoga postures and make money. The posture itself is not even 1/10 of Hatha yoga. There are many things in Hatha yoga like Yama, Niyama, Pratyahara, Ishvara Pranidhana, meditation. One small thing is to clean these chakras. You should also know which chakra is located where, which chakra is located where? The same thing applies to mantras as well. Chanting mantras also, now I said to them, "From today, you recite this mantra." Today, a lady came with Om. Hey brother, Om is something here. Now if your stomach chakra is caught then you, Om, Om what are you doing? This will be gripping you. Someone said, take the name of Krishna. Everyone here is getting throat cancer. Everyone is coming to me from there beaten. Mother, cure our cancer. Now think, here Sheri Krishna's presence is in the throat. In several places, I tell you many names. Now what should I do with them? I said, open a cancer hospital instead of building an ashram. Number of beggars roams the world in the name of that king. There is no shame. This is all the caste of beggars. They have caught their own pure chakras. What cancer is happening? Their cancer has even surpassed the cigarette sellers. Who will explain to them now? Everyone's condition will deteriorate. In four to five years, many throat cancer patients will be there, then they leave. The upper chakra, which we should call the navel chakra here. Although there is another chakra between it. This lower chakra shown here is called the Muladhara chakra. This controls our pelvic plexus. Now the pelvic plexus is a gross thing. It also has four sub plexuses. See, doctors also know this thing, it also has four sub plexuses. But this is outside in the gross and this chakra is inside in the subtle. Just as in a setup, the Prime Minister is sitting and his secretary is working outside. Similarly, in the central, Ganesh is seated. He also has four hands and their meanings too. And the functions performed by them are pelvic plexus, which also has four sub plexuses. All the chakras that are there, control the plexuses as much as they are. They also have petals. Ahead of that, you see I told you that there is a Muladhara chakra. The Muladhara chakra, which is the ocean of existence, is formed in its stomach, which is the form of the Virat. In its stomach, there is also a chakra called the navel chakra. This is also in the setup, in the backbone. But it activates the solar plexus. And this ocean of existence is oceanic. All the oceans of the world are made from it. And this is the principle of the guru. The principle of the guru is the principle of water. The principle of the guru is and in this only Dattatreya, who is the guru, the first guru, is made. Ten main avatars have been theirs. Among them are King Janak, Nanak, Mohammad, all are avatars of the same principle. Therefore, the fight between Muslims and Sikhs is absolutely foolishness. Nanak Sahab had come to unite both in the world. Later Muslims, the donkeys and they created havoc. And even now the thing they both had forbidden is the same. It was absolutely the same thing. Not two things. Absolutely one thing. It's also obvious to you that once Nanak Sahab lay with his feet towards Mecca. So someone said that Mecca is here. Why lay your feet here? So they said let's lay feet here, Mecca also came here. Wherever their feet were, there Mecca came. So if he wasn't Muhammad Sahab then how did it come? Think  about their identities. So in this ocean of existence, the person who becomes very extremist, of a caste, in which there is a lot of extremism, that person transcends. I am a Muslim, I am a Hindu, I am so and so, I am a Brahmin, that person get realization. This is the problem of the ocean of existence. And in between it, there is the navel chakra, this navel chakra protects our religion. 'Whenever there is a decline in righteousness, in this â€˜Bharata,', there is the place of Shri Vishnu and Lakshmi. The place of Lakshmi-Narayanji. And whenever there is a decline in righteousness, then the Supreme Divine Himself incarnates. Because this Krishna that you have seen, or Vishnuji, is the essence of our creation, meaning he is evolutionary, that's why he takes birth. Lord Shiva never took birth. Lord Brahma took birth only once, which resides in this chakra. And from this, revolving around all sides and its connection is from the navel. In this, there is the place of Brahma and Saraswati. They revolve around all sides, save this ocean of existence and establish righteousness in humans. There are ten main religions of humans. That's why there have been ten great gurus. Like there is the religion of gold. You say that gold never goes bad, it's indestructible. Similarly, there are ten religions in humans. When one gets deprived of this religion, then he becomes a demon. The Gurus have said that one should not drink alcohol because man becomes deprived of religion. That's why they prohibited it, and alcohol goes against your religion. If a person becomes a demon, then drink alcohol. I don't understand if someone becomes a demon, then what's the need to go to such places? And on top of that, they write poetry about it. And these Muslims consider themselves to be very big Muslims. There is no one bigger than those who drink alcohol. And what's happening with the Sikhs in London, it's shameful. They have created chaos behind wearing a helmet, and if they start drinking alcohol, then what will the English and the Russians drink? First, they used to drink secretly, now they do it openly. The biggest thing is that with the little knowledge we have been given, we can still navigate our way through. But now, if a drunkard or a glutton comes from there and claims his right over me, saying, "Mother, let me transcend," what right does he have? Does he have any right to get realized? When he didn't even listen to a small thing from his father, how can we let him self realize? And when he doesn't get through the realization, he will defame me. Is he like that only? He just spins tales. He performs magic. He chants mantras. And what are you? He should be asked, what have you done so far? Whom have you helped get realization? Whose welfare have you worked for? Have you done anything? You speak ill of your mother. What's your status? But here, whoever speaks up gets stigmatized. Nobody dares to speak against anyone. Now, I am telling you briefly about this because the topic is very vast. But tomorrow I will tell you about consciousness and subconscious mind. The chakra is called the heart chakra, and in the heart chakra is the place of Shri Jagadamba, the place of power. She is the mother of the entire universe. Because whenever big demons were born in the ocean of existence and they started harassing all the righteous people, then she herself comes and annihilates them, destroys them. For this, you will have to read Devi Bhagavatam, you will have to read Devi Purana. In this, there was no greater guru than Markandeya. Markandeya was also a great power. He was a great and powerful sage, and so was Adi Shankaracharya. They were present in the past. They didn't write anything. They just kept singing the praises of the mother day and night. If someone reads Shankaracharya, he didn't give any special description, he just continued singing the praises of the Beauty Wave and this Consciousness Wave that we vibrate. He was a great son. Now what to say about him? On his own head, now he's wearing a very small Bhatu Vaman and making a golden umbrella over his head. If it falls one day... now he's sitting. I heard that he's getting his heavy umbrella made of gold. Now if he gets hurt, don't blame me, I'm telling you. Make at least this much so that his head doesn't get hurt. If it falls, spread it all around, sit in the middle comfortably. And while sitting there, may be he's going to heaven in the airplane. And everyone goes to worship him, especially all the poor South Indians, their brains seem to be pickled. I asked a lady, "Where did your diamond go?" I donated it. I said to whom? Oh! She started saying it's that being built, diamonds should be set in it. I said put diamonds in it and also have four or five elephants standing. Make it. Each spectacle is happening in the world. Just see, are these the forms of God? Are these how God's people are? Hey, God's people are emperors. They have empires. What will you give them? Empire is that even if you sleep on the ground, you are still an emperor. Even if you stay in a palace, you are still an emperor. Whether you stay anywhere, you are still an emperor. It should be said to the man of God that these are his... roam around with a crown, diamonds set in it. Putting diamonds in donkeys doesn't make anyone a king. They think so. That by putting a little diamond in their fort, their fortune will be made. Alright, so this is the place of the goddess.  Devi, who resides in the heart chakra, is the place of Shiva. The soul-form of Shiva resides in the heart at all times. I always give this as an example. Nowadays, there is a great modern example. Just like a small lamp keeps burning in the gas light, you must have seen a small flicker burning in your gas at home. And as soon as the light comes, just by saying the light, as soon as the gas stream comes, it means the Kundalini rises up, its light catches it. And the consciousness you have, the light comes into it. Your consciousness is not yet illuminated. It should somehow be brought near the heart. And the heart, where Shiva resides, is actually the abode of Sadashiva, the space. The place is there but the abode is here. So as soon as the Kundalini touches here, the heart becomes illuminated just like that. This is the place of Sadashiva. We call it higher than the Brahma-randhra, the place of Sadashiva. As soon as it touches there, your consciousness becomes illuminated. Then Brahma starts flowing from within you. Whatever you speak, whether it's true or false, vibrations of vibration will come to you immediately. This flowing from within you is Brahma himself. And Brahma, which is the light of the soul, and the soul is the shadow of the Supreme Soul. The shadow of the Supreme Soul or the reflection that exists within is the form of the soul. The Supreme Soul should be considered in the form of Sadashiva. Because it is from His manifestation that later Brahma and Vishnu emerge as three aspects. Meaning, initially, there is a form of Sadashiva, and from Him, three aspects emerge. We can call it the form of Sadashiva or Shiva's form, which is always in an existent state. Because of Him, we exist. If our heart stops today, we will cease to exist.

Existence, which is called existence, is in the form of Shiva. After that, the form of Brahma is the creator, meaning, they create. It should be said that they create the entire world. And after that, the third form is that of Vishnu, who is considered our sustainer. They sustain our evolution. Because of them, righteousness sets within us. Righteousness sets from every element. Every creation, everything has its righteousness. Plant a mango tree, and mangoes will come out. All these tasks are done by their creative power. Meaning, it is their evolution. The place of Shiva is here. Now, Shiva gets angry very quickly. He's a simple man, isn't he? He gets angry very quickly. Especially if someone even makes a small mistake, he gets angry very quickly. To appease him, one has to catch the feet of Adi Shakti directly when he gets angry. So, one should not anger him. And why does he get angry? He gets angry when the human mind is not in the soul. Understand the person. He's a hot yogi. The one who removes his desires, should be called a hot yogi. They earn for their body day and night. The more a person's mind is diverted towards the body, the more trouble he will get. The person who works very hard and thinks, "I should do this too, I should do that too, I should earn money, I should build a house, after building a house, I should buy an airplane, after buying 11 airplanes, I don't know what else to do," people like these get rooted. That's why people get heart attacks. Because the mind is not towards the soul. Keep the mind towards the soul. Especially in your city of Delhi. This is a very common thing. I say this in very mild words that it's an imbalance. People are happy with it, not angry. The activity on the right side is more. You're working hard. Relaxation is forbidden. Let's work hard. Earn money. Contribute to the country's development. What does development mean? Are we doing what England is doing here? Here, 10% of people commit suicide. 10% of people go to mental asylums. 10% of people sit in orphanages. 10% of children consume cannabis. Similarly, if 10% contribute, then if 1% sits back, they cooperate. This is the situation. You have to create it here. Where a grandmother marries a grandson. These English used to rule over us before. What fools they were. So, where should I begin? Even a fool wouldn't do that. And it's common. Grandfathers marry granddaughters, and grandmothers marry grandsons. It's common. They have no shame. In London. Very common. Their love letters keep coming in the newspaper every morning. When you open the newspaper, it feels like the Gita is written. These unrighteous people ruled here for so long. At that time, there weren't so many fools. Now, there are many. Now they've become liberated, right? There, the old men have become so foolish, so foolish, they call them all "silly old blocks" there. The girls there are very clever. They've made a name for themselves. Some call them sugar daddies. They keep an old man sitting. They keep consuming his money. They roam around comfortably. Fifteen-year-old girls are very clever. They become clever from the age of thirteen. They start flirting from the age of fifteen. Enough, what's the use of earning money? So what if one is old? So what if one has had four marriages? And if people satisfy their vanity, they do the same. What fools! Old people become vain. They develop an inferiority complex. Because there's no wisdom in them. If there's an old person here, it's a big deal, right, baba, they've become old. Come, sit, and touch their feet. They don't do any work without being asked. The old men there are such fools, who will touch their feet? America, don't even mention their name. They're their grandfathers. What fools. What is there to learn from these fools? Why are you developing, baba? As soon as they have more money, their feet start to go up. First, alcohol. Those who drink alcohol shouldn't even be promoted. They shouldn't be given a single penny more. It's only when they have extra money that they drink alcohol. If they were to die of hunger, why drink, right? The politicians there have ruined them. What do they have? They just need to somehow get money, get votes, that's it. Then you do what you want. You have to pass that law. We'll do it, give us votes. Because politicians are also there, they don't have any principles. So, this law is also going to be passed there. There's a lot of effort to remove this absurd law. Not even on brothers and sisters. You'll be surprised there. If you go to London with your sister, you won't get a place in any hotel. Brothers and sisters are not allowed, they say. If you want, you can bring another woman with you. You'll be surprised, and people there think, how cans this happen in Hindustan? This can't happen. We said, brother, here, just leave your brothers, but if you accept someone as a brother once, the whole family considers him a brother. Where are you? You're not even worth the dust of our feet.

For them, there is much to learn from themselves for many days. The simple things within you don't penetrate those fools. Leave aside my disciples. They are very cultured. They started saying, "Mother, this means we have no culture within us." I said, "That's what it means, son." Now you understand. They started saying, "Our eyes wander here and there a lot, at least stop that." Ganesh keeps everything with him, that, "Hey Ganesh, make us holy." So I said, "Put your eye on the earth for that." But if you put your eye on your earth, it will be fine. So you will be surprised to see that they keep looking straight ahead. They don't even lift their eyes. That's another thing. The seekers there are very influential, they are heavyweight seekers. Once they say something, it's like holding their ears, they've had enough. They started saying its all dark. Now think about it, they're taking out Christ's photo there. They're taking out a picture that Christ had a bad relationship with his mother. I said, this picture won't work in Hindustan. Take it there. So they'll have to bring in Queen to veto this, that this picture won't be made until I'm alive. Poor thing. There's no path left for the honest there. So when you come into the mode of passion, there's passion on the right side. Coming out of ignorance and entering into passion, you're in the midst, so you should stay in the middle. That's why Buddha said one should stay in the middle. A person who descends too much into passion goes into excess. And it's because of going into excess that he gets transgression. Now you understand how I explained about the chakras. There's a lot of difference between the Muladhara Chakra and the Muladhara here. The Muladhara where the Kundalini is located and no one can enter the Muladhara Chakra. It's extremely sacred. Information comes to it only from the Mother. When you go before a person or an incarnation who has authority, only then does the Kundalini move, and it tells the Muladhara Chakra, "Yes, it's okay." Then they release it from here. Both have powers, both sides to reduce harsh tension. And then the Kundalini rises slowly, passing through the navel chakra, passing through the heart chakra and going up. As I said, on one side of the heart chakra is the place of Shiva. And on that side, when you involve your Lakshmi-Narayana with ten avatars, then in the eighth avatar, when Shri Ramachandraji's avatar happened, that place is theirs. But Ramachandraji is not in the middle. He is on the right side. He was seated on Rajogun. He was also forgotten that he is an incarnation. Because he was seated on Rajogun, it was established that this is the dignity of man. Because he came as an ideal king. Dignified man. Therefore, the dignity of a man is Ramachandraji. The person in whom this dignity is not there, this chakra catches him. Many people think that if we get freedom, then let go of dignity. Secondly, the person who does not have reverence for his father, this chakra catches him. The left heart catches the one who does not have reverence for his mother. And the one who does not have reverence for his father, who misbehaves with his father, this chakra catches him too. Also, if someone mistreats their children, this chakra catches them too.

The chakra in the middle, when it catches hold of women, they get breast cancer. This leads to a sense of insecurity. When this chakra catches, or when that chakra catches, or when this chakra catches, then in these three chakras, a person experiences palpitations and troubles like dizziness. This is just about illness. But there are many subtle things beyond this. I'll explain to you about the upper chakras tomorrow. The chakra above it, behind the throat, is called the Vishuddhi Chakra. It contains the place of Shri Radha-Krishna. Going to their place completes their incarnation. There are sixteen petals there plexes and sixteen sub plexes. And from this, our eyes, nose, this entire forehead, especially this portion here, which causes people sinus and so on. Mouth, jaw, ears, nose, throat, etc., everything happens from here. Now it's very important to understand these chakras well. Therefore, I will tell you about them tomorrow. And above this is the Agnya Chakra. It's a very important chakra. I'll tell you about it tomorrow. After that comes the Sahasrara. In this way, you have seen how Kundalini rises on its own in the seven chakras. How Kundalini rises, how it ascends, I will tell you about it also day after tomorrow. And I will also tell you how conscious, all conscious collective, and supra-conscious and collective supra-conscious, all conscious and collective conscious, how you become aware in them. I will explain all these things to you scientifically. After listening to today's lecture, vibrations have also increased completely, which has also benefited from it. Don't just listen to the lecture and leave afterwards, don't do that. Respect yourself. Attain your property. Everyone says emotional, mental problems. Get your property. Once you attain your property, your physical and mental problems will come to an end. And you will reach that state which is called the witness form. And this dynamic power of God, flowing from your hands, will continue. Let me finish by telling you a short story! Once, Radha Ji felt very envious of the flute. So she went to Krishna and asked why the flute is always in your mouth? So Krishna said, go and ask the flute yourself. So she went to the flute and asked, "Bhai, what is your specialty, what is your uniqueness?" So the flute laughed and said, "You don't know. My specialty is that all my uniqueness has been lost. I have become hollow. The flow, the music comes from within me, and I keep listening." Similarly, you become like this, and that's why God has created you to become His flute. His actions will be carried out through you. You will know Him now. You will also know His actions. You will know His incomprehensible play. You will know His omnipotent power. And all this can be your own. But if your limited intellect is rusty, then it will become cold, brother. Limited things don't work beyond the limit. In this, you have to dive into the infinite. It's extremely subtle, and the intellect should also be subtle. Your mind should also be a little subtle. If your mind is always occupied with external things, then it won't work. Come into the subtlety a little. Once you attain subtlety, you can control all gross things, even plants, animals, and creatures, just like that. But first, you have to attain subtlety. It's very easy. There's nothing difficult in it. When I was in London, the people there said, "Mother, it's very cold. Can you make it a bit warmer?" I said, "Alright, you want summer, come here tomorrow." You must have heard that there are two or three summers in London. Ask my disciples. Our program was supposed to happen here in Delhi last month. So Subramanyam sir said, "Mother, it's getting very cold here. It's going down to 3 degrees Celsius. What should we do?" I said, "Alright, let's postpone it till next month. We don't have time now. We'll come next month." So he said, "No, no, by February, it will be very cold. It will be absolutely freezing." I said, "Alright, if you say so, then fine." Before our arrival, the Sun God started working hard here for just one day. And now you are sitting comfortably. So, this is not a difficult task. First, attain subtlety. Once you attain subtlety, what is in this hand? You have already gained control over the gross. But the gross has settled in your head. Like this gross is here, like you have managed electricity, but your work doesn't run without electricity because electricity has taken control of you. But when you transcend and reach a state where you are sitting above all the gross, then the gross touches your feet, and those who want to do something can make it happen. It doesn't even matter then. There is no interest either. Then a person creates within himself and the most beautiful miracle is you, people, human beings, and then it's fun. Just like now, there's a gentleman, Premapuri sir, if he comes, everyone says, "Look, look, how his vibrations come." It's like that. Fragrance keeps flowing from within you from morning till evening. Keep taking that fragrance. Keep attaining it.
