1985-12-24 India Tour 1985/86: Christmas Eve - with Music and Bhajans, Pune

Sahaja Yogi: May we wish You, [Mother,] a Happy Christmas. For all the existent [unclear].

Shri Mataji: Same to you all. Happy Christmas and very happy New Year. Please be seated. Please be seated. [Mother speaks in Marathi.]

Today it’s a great day for Me to celebrate the Christmas Eve in Poona. Poona is called as Punya Patanam in our ancient books. That means this is the place which is very holy, place of, we can say the, it is the city of holiness, and here to celebrate the birthday of Jesus is something so sensible, so correct, so proper because He was nothing but punya. He was nothing but holiness, and that His birthday should be celebrated here is absolutely so sahaja that I started feeling, going back in the history, if Christ was born in Poona, what [could/would] have happened? But then I thought, supposing He was born here, then people all over the world would not have accepted Him because He had to be crucified. If He was not crucified, the sadist won’t be happy. If they are not happy, they won’t allow Christianity to spread, in the real sense of the word, I mean the Christianity.

With all understanding, He was born in Jerusalem. [Was/So] a humble place Jerusalem, very humble place, and He was born in a very humble place, in a, as you know, in the company of the cattle, around him. And the whole birth took place in such a miraculous way that Mother didn’t have to suffer for that, didn’t have to go to any doctor or to any physician or anything. It was so spontaneous, so beautiful. He gave no trouble to Mother throughout. His birth is one of the signs that He never gave any trouble to His mother.

When we are in Sahaja Yoga, when we have to have our realization, perhaps people do not realize how much Mother has to go through to raise the Kundalini, to achieve the Realization. It's not an easy thing. He never argued with His Mother and He never troubled Her; always obeyed Her because He knew who She was and He knew what He was. He knew the relationship very well, knew in the sense that it was a part and parcel of His understanding. In His nervous system He knew it. As we say, He had the Prabodh. And so from the very beginning when He was born He was no trouble to His Mother at all. Extremely obedient, kind, never pressing His [stand], always looking after Her, very protective. Such a great soul was born in Jerusalem. And there what happened? Bethlehem He was born, near Jerusalem, but there what happened? As you know the three kings came from far off. Nobody knew about His birth in the surroundings, say in Jerusalem area or Bethlehem area. Nobody bothered. But from very far off, three great kings came to see Him. It’s very symbolic that to the people who were nearer, closer to Him, it was nothing. They were so gross. They had no sensitivity. And from miles away, they started walking, coming on the camel, sometimes resting in the night. Days in and days out they traveled with the help of the star and came to that little abode which was in Bethlehem.

In a small little place to arrive with that humility, how sensitive they must be. They forgot their position in life. They forgot their own wealth and all those things they have been enjoying. To them it was the greatest thing, the greatest pilgrimage to go all the way to see the little child who was not talking. He was not doing anything. They felt it’s a privilege to honor Him, just to honor Him, just to pay Him honor. What was the need? A little child would not even recognize. He did; that’s a different point. But just to pay the honor they must have gone through very great difficulties to go down to Bethlehem. It was not a city. It was a village, where there was no place for them to rest. God knows where they stayed. There had no hotels like this in those days. God knows where they stayed. They dressed up very well because they have to see the King of kings.

They were properly dressed. With great humility they bowed before the little child. That’s only possible if you are that sensitive, at that distance to know that there is a great soul born. Thank God that it was not Kaliyuga of that kind, but that is today, that the sensitivities in the Kaliyuga is so finished that people can’t feel the Divinity. They cannot see the Divinity. They have no sense of beauty. They have no sense of anything that is pure, holy or auspicious. Spontaneously sahaja, they all came down to see the great child born. Because it was the work of the Divine to create such a great child just out of the punyas, nothing but punyas, nothing but holiness that this child was created, and that they knew about it, they came all the way.

Today is such a great day for Me, that in that place where people were so gross, nobody knew what Christ was, child was born in a manger. And today in this great holy place we are celebrating His birthday. This is a real honor. We are praying to Him. By that we are honored. It’s a great privilege that in this holy place we are giving Him that honor. It’s our privilege. By that He doesn’t become great; He doesn’t become great. It’s you who are honoring Him because you see the greatness in that personality. Thank God human beings have at least this much, little bit left in them that they appreciate the greatness of others, little bit.

So you all have come from so many countries here from all over, not with those difficulties, of course – they have been all put right – not with ordeals or anything, but you are here to celebrate His birthday in this holy place which should have been the right place for Him to be born and not that horrible place where He was crucified later.

It’s doubly glorifying that we are celebrating His birthday here, though even this city is very much spoilt in the Kaliyuga, very much ruined, but is surrounded by vibrations of many saints who have built up this city. That’s why it is called as a punya nagari. And anybody who tries to spoil the vibrations of this place is thrown out. This you have seen in many cases. Though we can see lots of negative forces have tried to penetrate inside this place, your presence here should clear this city also and create that atmosphere that Christ would like to see on this earth.

It’s said that Christ is to be born within us. What sort of a place we have in our heart for Christ to be born? Is it the same gross place where He took His birth or is it the place of holiness in our heart? If He is being born in the same sort of a place, are we going to again crucify Him? Or we are going to make our heart clean, holy, auspicious, like a lotus, so that when He is born in that heart, He resides in a way that is behoving His own personality. When we respect ourselves, we respect Him. Let us have a heart of that kind.

It’s very easy to give a lecture on this, very easy to give lecture, but it’s difficult to establish that heart. And that heart which is of that level and that quality can only make Christ happy. Otherwise, He cannot be happy. We still indulge into gross processes, and gross understanding, gross relationships, gross procedures. We still do not take to the holy procedures. In the holy procedure, there is no sacrifice, is a sacrifice. Everything is enjoyment. No duty is without joy. Everything you do has to be from the heart. Because you are doing from the heart, it has to be a beautiful thing.

It’s very easy to say that we follow Christ. What do you follow? Are you going to follow Him up to the cross? Where are you following Him? Which part of His life you are following? You are all realized souls. You are born again. As Christ has said, “You are to be born again.” All right, now you are born again. Then what are you doing about it? Cleanse your heart; cleanse your heart. Then I still find there are jealousies. There is a problem of temperaments between different people. Still groups are formed. We live in little, little groups of, say, this country, that country, this group, that group.

Then I find also people just fighting for little, little things, missing all the points of joy. This has to change. I do not want at this happier occasion to tell you the hazardous life Christ had to lead. He lived only for such a short time. The kind of life He led with all that, that He had is remarkable, and what a pure life He led, what a pure heart He had, and one single desire in His heart was to bring down the kingdom of God. That should be our desire. In our collective we have to understand, we have to bring down the kingdom of God. Are we sufficiently supporting that? Have we got the foundations within us? Can we withstand all that upon our shoulders?

It is said in Marathi that forgiveness is the decoration of a Veera. Veera is the brave. Only the brave could forgive. Now, how many of us really know how to forgive others and to love others? So many write that, “Mother, my heart is like a stone.” So now you jump in the sea. What are you doing here? Stones must go to the sea. Or they say, “My heart is not open.” I say, “Why do you write like this?” “Because I’m very, very frank and honest.” With whom are you honest? For such people there is no Sahaja Yoga. They should really leave Sahaja Yoga and go away. Sahaja Yoga is meant for people who have a very large heart where Christ could be [adorned/adored]. He’s to be restored upon that great heart of yours.

In every way one has to enlarge the heart. That’s why I think William Blake* very clearly said that, “England should be the Jerusalem.” But only by saying that William Blake said so, one should know that it’s complete [darkness], complete [darkness]. He is hoping against hopes. Large heartedness is missing among the people who live on the heart. As you know about the French, they call themselves Christians. Italians, who have so-called Christianity, have the worst pictures; so licentious, so horrible, so much against Christ. It’s very surprising. How we can do such things to bring bad name to Him and to the whole world where you represent Him? People think Christianity means licentiousness, permissiveness, drunkenness, abandonment of all the values, while Christ was just the opposite of. Absolutely, He did not need any values. He was gunatit. He is dharmatit, everything. But how He lived on this earth, such an ideal! So before us we have got a great ideal. We don’t have to follow the ideals of these horrible kings who lived there. But we have to follow the ideal of Christ and those kings who followed the ideal of Christ. Because if you are following Him, the path that you are following has to be, the essence of Christ’s life is a pure life of love and sacrifice. This is what one has to follow.

Throughout His life, He has been using this essence just to establish Himself in our Agnya Chakra and that’s what He’s worked very, very hard to do that. Let us not do anything to let Him down in our character. You just put a test to yourself. Do you think Christ [would/could] have done this? Do you think Christ was, would have accepted this? A simple test can tell you that Christ is the measuring rod for all our qualities. That is how we move. That’s the standard. Not that He’s only the light, that He is the Nirakara, He is Omkara, He is Shri Ganesha, but all that has come to life. He lived like us, like a human being. And in His life, what He would never have done, would never have compromised, would never have accepted, would never have digested, we cannot have it. This is what today on this holy land of Punya Patanam we have to say that, sitting down here, we have to feel it. Let’s have that decision within ourselves. Let our hearts open out. Let’s have Christ blossoming in our lotuses, in the fragrance of our heart. We all have it. Let that Spirit be awakened in this beautiful place which is built by the saints, the ancient saints of this country. Let that Ganesha awaken within ourselves, that holiness, that auspiciousness. May God bless you all.

Today is a special day, is they are very joyous that you are all here. And they all want to thank you very much for being here on a Christmas Day, and I, I would like to thank all the Poona Sahaja yogis for arranging this so beautifully, so nicely, making you comfortable, looking after you so well. They are working day in and day out. I promised them one thing, that very soon we’ll be able to start a proper meditation center here, and by God’s grace everything should work out.

I’m going to ask the Commissioner to help us out, and they are all very anxious to help us out. Imagine what a place it is! The Commissioner is with us, the Collector is with us, the Commissioner of Police is with us. They are all so much anxious to help Sahaja Yoga. What a country it is! What a place it is we are in here! So I hope we’ll be able to establish some sort of a good meditation place here for them. That’s one point. And the second thing is the way they have organized, in this short time. Because this we decided in Nasik only that we’ll give them two days more for Poona, definitely. But the way they organized everything for you near Dehu was so remarkable. All food, everything to be arranged into that place is really, I tell you, we can’t do that. We all put together can’t do it. The way they have managed, the way they had it. And these are the marriage days to get everything done. We have to thank them very much for making you comfortable here.

I wish we had list of people who will be coming to Ganapatipule, but unfortunately I don’t have the list. I hope most of them who have organized it would be there. We would like to honor them when they come to Ganapatipule, on the program we are having, that first we are having a Puja, and evening time we’ll be having presentations from the western Sahaja yogis for the Indian Sahaja yogis. So that night we’ll spend. And next day we are going to have haldi in the morning and the marriages in the evening. Luckily, we have also arranged for all of you to go down to Mahabhaleshwar. After the wedding all the wedding people can, married people can go there and stay there next day so that, there, you’ll get a room to yourself and you’ll be very comfortable. It’s a very beautiful health resort or you can call it, it’s a very beautiful hill station.

So all has been arranged, I think. God is very kind; it’s all arranged so well. In all this comfort and all this enjoyment we have to know that all this is given to us to be shared with others. It’s not only that we should have everything. We have to share it with others. For that we have to work very hard. We have to get more people and more people and more people. Only thing I just want My health to be all right so that I can do one or two more tours like this because sometimes I feel that it’s a bit too much. I should stop it. But by God’s grace again somehow I don’t feel tired. And things are being managed so well. If there has been any problem, anything, you shouldn’t mind. And our next trip we are going to Brahmapuri which you all liked very much. It’s all going to be arranged in Brahmapuri. You know what it is like. Those people who are older, who have any difficulties, we have made arrangements for them also. So, try to help them out because I don’t want them to suffer physically, because we are all going to a jungle. Actually, it’s a jungle, as you know that. So all the programs are being nicely laid down, you won’t have any problems and we’ll have a nice time in Brahmapuri.

After Brahmapuri, as you know, we are going not to Malarpet but to another place called Atit and then to Koynanagar and next day you will be in Ganapatipule which you will definitely say, “Mother, you have brought us to the most beautiful spot ever known.” Everything is going to be arranged. But I want to warn you: it’s a place very far-fetched. There’s nothing there. You have to get everything from Kholapur. So, one should go with a mind of helping them than to find faults. If you have to do a little work you will know how difficult it is. So not to find any faults, not to feel unhappy but to be satisfied, and that’s where the sea and Shri Ganesha meet. It’s a very beautiful spot. Nowhere you’ll find [it/this]; that’s the place where sea and Shri Ganesha meet. Not only that, but when it is a high tide then the water starts coming through the Nabhi of Shri Ganesha and the, only the lower part of the body you see there. The upper part, the head, is the whole of the mountain, which you can walk around and give a pradarshakshina. It’s a beautiful spot, at least to Me. Maybe My ideas about beauty are a little different, maybe. But to Me it’s so beautiful, so peaceful, and there everybody will clear out, but don’t have complaints and preoccupied ideas and a brain that is all the time trying to attack others. Have a simple mind like a child. It’s a, you are going to Ganesha’s place after all, you see. You are surrendering yourself to Shri Ganesha. [You have, So] to be a simple person to go there, very simple, and you’ll find the place is so beautiful, so full of vibrations that you’ll clear out in no time. Everything will clear out. It’s a very wonderful place. That’s what I think. I hope it will work out with you the same way.

So may God bless you. We are looking forward for a nice new year and we’ll celebrate our new year there. So, I wish you a very, very happy, prosperous and a divine new year for all the countries.

[Marathi]

Before we do anything they want to give presents. Poona center people want to give presents to you all, those who are here, the all big centers. So about fourteen centers, they want to give you presents here because you’ll be collecting one after another. And then the Bombay center has [brought/bought] some presents which, I think better then let them give it in Ganapatipule. And, of course, your Mother has some presents also.

Now, we have to have people. So relax, relax here. You people are too tense and serious. It’s Christmas Day. It’s very funny like, like on a Christmas Day, they have a champagne, and somebody dies, also they have a champagne. They become serious on a Christmas Day, and somebody dies, also they are serious. Now it’s a Christmas Day. All right, so today there are [Mother speaks in Marathi] so there are fourteen centers as they have counted it. Will you be able to locate those fourteen centers, those people who are there one by one? Gavin, you please read it out. Gavin, you say it, one by one.

Gavin: From Austria, [Megan].

Shri Mataji: Austria. There, [come here]. May God bless you.

Gavin : From Australia [Ray].

Shri Mataji: May God bless you. Gavin.

Gavin: From Belgium, Rene.

Shri Mataji: These are very special type of things, very special type of a – something, a specialty.

Shri Mataji: You better take the name, now – that’s the chance.

Gavin: From France, Christine.

Shri Mataji: Second name – take it fast.

Gavin: From France.

Gavin: And next, from Switzerland, Richard. And then USA, another Christine. Then, from Holland, [is] Henno.

Shri Mataji: [Marathi].

Gavin: Next from Germany, [Kitty]. From UK, David. From New Zealand, Brian. From Italy, Giorgio. From Canada, Michael.

Shri Mataji: She understands Me?

Sahaja Yogi: Germany, please.

Gavin: There’s someone from Spain.

Shri Mataji: Twelfth.

Gavin: From Hong Kong, Peter.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

Gavin: From all over the world, Warren.

Shri Mataji: How many they are? Twelve?

Gavin: Thirteen.

Shri Mataji: Thirteen. Good. [Means we] can’t have thirteen. [unclear]

Sahaja Yogi: Algeria? That’s a good idea. I have to speak [unclear], I have to....

Shri Mataji: No, no, you have it, we have one Algerian.

Gavin: From Algeria, [Shyle].

Shri Mataji: [Marathi/Hindi] May God bless you. Now you can go and have a look at this. Then we’ll have our music. Would you like to have it later after music or before music? In this country nobody objects if you put it on even at two o’clock in the night. It’s not like England. They will on the contrary join you. So would you like to have it now or afterwards?

Sahaja Yogis: No, afterwards.

Shri Mataji: Afterwards? [Marathi] What, what do you have in program, your program for Christmas? What is your program, Gavin?

Gavin: There are many countries have prepared. So it’s also [unclear] the same thing.

Shri Mataji: All right, so now dances also. So we’ll have the dances first and then the music. All right, now first of all, sari will be as they give that to Me. [Marathi] So, I think, you better finish that job first. That’s a job. I am getting presents from all, for all these deities. Imagine. Only for Me you should give Me, but instead I am getting all these things. Rajesh. Who’s come? Is that Rajesh? [Marathi/Hindi] Has he come? Not yet? All right. So first we’ll have the dance or presents and everything, what, whichever way you decide.

Sahaja Yogi: Dance, then the presents...

Shri Mataji: First the dance then the ...

Sahaja Yogi: Then the music and then presents.

Shri Mataji: That’s better. Postpone it as much as possible. And if you decide not to give some present now, I’ll be thankful.

Sahaja Yogis: No chance.

Shri Mataji: No chance, all right. I agree. [Marathi] Now there is one thing, you have to give an international sari to me. That you can give Me also at the beginning of that, all right? [Marathi]

What they are saying that all the programs are going to be from this stage. Everybody is going to come up and sing and all that. So, this stage has to be vacated. Then again I’ll have to come back here. All right? For presents. Is it all right? Yes, only one thing. [Marathi] I think so would be better. [I’ll let] you get it. [Marathi]

[Recording of music performance and Christmas Eve celebrations December 24].

Sahaja Yogini: And the words say how good and joyful it is for all the brothers to live as one in peace.

[Sahaja Yoginis perform a song in Romanian? “Inema Tobu Manayim, Shekera Kingdom Vyaka“].

[Sahaja Yogis sing “Come Shri Mataji”].

[Shri Mataji is addressing in English and Marathi.]

Shri Mataji: Good. Thank you very much. All of you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Bring it here. I will cut it here.

Sahaja Yogi: Many Happy Returns of the Day.

Shri Mataji: Many Happy Returns of the Day? Not my birthday today. Beautiful. Give her.

[Inaudible, followed by applause].

Shri Mataji (in English and Marathi): Good. My God, such a small cake. (Laughs). There are two cakes. One has come from Bombay, another from here. First cut the Bombay cake. You can say the mantra of Agyna chakra.

[Cake is being cut or distributed. Mother is asking for a knife and plate].

Sahaja Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Jesus Mary Sakshat Shri Adishakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

[Applause].

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Sahaja Yogi: Jaswant, please light the fireworks. Jaswant, light the fireworks quickly.

[Applause and fireworks].

Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Sahaja Yogis: Adishakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Sahaja Yogis: Jai Mataji.

[Shri Mataji asks the organisers to only burst crackers and have fireworks the next day, so others can also see them].

Sahaja Yogi: Jaswant, do not set-off the fireworks.

Sahaja Yogi to Mother: Sari, on Christmas day.

[Applause].

[Inaudible, preparations to continue performance].

Sahaja Yogi: Who is ready? Italy? Italy on stage. Italy?

Shri Mataji: Sit here. Hello?

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is a very ancient traditional song from Italy that we thought of re-making for you. Christmas song.

[The group sings an Italian song, “O Dio Beato”].

Sahaja Yogi: Translation of this song.

“You came from the stars

You came from the stars into the cold of the cave,

Oh King of the Heavens.

The Divine Child shivering.

Oh Blissful God, tell us,

How much did it cost you to love us?

You are the creator of the world.

There is not even a fire or a piece of cloth to warm You, my Lord.

Oh favourite Child, Love is the cause of your poverty.

And Your poverty enamours me.

Oh Divine Child, I can see you shivering.

Oh Blissful God, tell us,

How much did it cost you to love us?”

[Applause].

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, we do not know whether to do another song. This is what we prepared for the occasion.

[A performance follows, of a joyous Italian song, “Churi/Fiori?” accompanied with claps and foot tapping].

Sahaja Yogi: This is another [inaudible/page?] to another popular Sicilian song. The chorus was

“Flowers, flowers in bloom all year long.

The love you gave to me, I now give back to you.”

And now we have a presentation, one for each chakra.

“To our Mother, who has lit up our hearts, we will now sing these flowers.

Hoping they will be worthy and pure, just like the fragrance of an orange orchard.

The first one is a beautiful flower from the Earth. Orange in colour and with scent like myrrh.

It protects wisdom and fights the wars. Then it takes wisdom back to the womb.

The second gives us the pure knowledge and over abundant joy of creation.

Strength, energy and true scienceof the kind of which we never have known.

The third one has brought us the laws to keep saintly our lives.

Faith, honesty and health are gifts that it got from the sky.

The fourth bears the most important name.

It is made like a cup that is filled.

It gives us courage, love and feeling and we must always keep [inaudible].

The fifth flower is a living flower of the rocks.

It is dancing, playful and it always plays the flute.

It has got the entire universe in its mouth.

And woe to those who go against it.

The sixth is the purest among flowers.

It has no clothes nor shoes nor any money.

And it is called the lily of our Lord.

At the very top we find the most fragrant one.

With a thousand petals all spread out.

A thousand colours, a thousand variations.

This is the supreme blessing [inaudible]”.

[Applause].

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji says this is why the Kundalini rises so fast.

Sahaja Yogi: This next song from Australia is called “Orana”. “Orana” in the aboriginal language. And probably derived from Sanskrit means “welcome”.

“Out on the plains the brolgas are dancing

Lifting their feet like war horses prancing

Up to the sun the woodlarks go singing

Faint in the dawn light echoes their singing

Orana!  Orana!  Orana to Christmas Day!

Pink blush of dawn the red rock is shining

First born of Mother greeting his brother

Out of the Earth and into the sunlight.

As if Ganesha lifting her higher.

Orana!  Orana!  Orana to Jesus Christ!”

[Sahaja Yogis sing “Orana”].

[Sahaja Yogi recites words of “O Little One”].

Sahaja Yogi:

“O Little One, O Little One, all wrapped in swaddling clothes.

Your Mother sings sweet lullabies, your father watches on.

Conceived within the heart of God, pure love he issues forth.

To His Mother’s heart he gives the joy, to us He gives the light.

The angels call the shepherds nigh, to praise the God all night.

Three holy kings the bright star brings.

All bow to the Mother, the child.

The world awaits this Holy Child.

Who comes to us this time.

Glory to God our Father dear.

And peace on Earth to all men.”

[Sahaja Yogis sing “O Little One”].

[Applause].

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, just a simple song from England which everyone can join in with. I will split the crowd into three, sections and, that is, three parts.

Shri Mataji: Now, what do you want to do?

Sahaja Yogi: We will sing it first. I would like to divide the crowd, please, Sahaja Yogis before.

Shri Mataji: Did you follow that? So which is that? You have only divided into two. How do you divide?

Sahaja Yogi: First division, where that gap is.

Shri Mataji: We will do one thing, those who are sitting on the chairs is one group.

Sahaja Yogi: OK. Those with the chair, first group. Those on that side, second group. And those on this side, third group. OK.

Shri Mataji: You can stand to form a third group. Or you may stand up, so you can a little bit. Few people should stand up on this side.

Sahaja Yogi: People on the chairs, stand up please.

Shri Mataji; You have been sitting long, isn’t it? And some of you should go on the side, some of you.

Sahaja Yogi: Including those at the back.

Shri Mataji: So that’s better. Now this is the first group. Now all right? Now the second group is sitting down. Those who want to join the first group.

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible/those sitting in the chairs].

Shri Mataji (in Marathi): Those sitting at the back, Indian Sahaja Yogis, they are saying you should stand and sing along with the first group. Number one means, they are performing in three groups, there should be no mix-up about it. You have to sing with number one. No, no, not everyone. Those sitting on the chairs.

And half of those sitting should sing with this group and the other half sitting should sing with this group. And those who are standing are group one.

That is number one, then number two and number three. And you must up keep with them.

I hope you can manage. [Laughter].

It should not be a crowd. It should be Sahaja Yogis.

Give a bandhan. [Laughter]. Before starting. Give a bandhan.

[Inaudible].

Shri Mataji: Now, it’s all right.

Sahaja Yogi: That is the first group. That is the second group. That is the third group.

Shri Mataji: That is correct. Those who are standing is the first group. This side is the second group sitting down. Third group [break in audio].

Shri Mataji: What about something being played with it.

Sahaja Yogi: Now the words are simple, Mother.

“Mother, I adore you.

All my life I give you.

How I love you.”

[Inaudible].

Shri Mataji: You have to direct. You have to direct.

Sahaja Yogi: What I will do, for the first group to come in I will point like them. Then I want the second group to come in, I will point to them. Then the third group, likewise.

Shri Mataji (in Marathi): Understood? Should I explain it in Marathi? Understood?

[The three groups of Sahaja Yogis perform the song in a sequence].

“Mother, I adore you.

All my life I give you.

How I love you.”

“Mother, I adore you.

All my life I give you.

How I love you.”

“Mother, I adore you.

All my life I give you.

How I love you.”

Sahaja Yogi: All together.

Sahaja Yogis:

“Mother, I adore you.

All my life I give you.

How I love you.”
