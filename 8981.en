1982-1028 H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, Self Realization at Public Program in New York, USA

Come tomorrow to see me. I’ll tell you. Leukomia. That is not difficult. This is not difficult. Don’t you worry. You see they want to suffer. They are Jews. Ha, ha, ha, ha… Look at that now. See… This is non-sense. This is nonsense. You see. You can’t create this body. Can you create this human body? Why do you want to suffer? You have no respect. Absolutely it has no meaning at all. I can’t understand. You want to torture yourself. This is a wrong idea. Absolutely wrong idea. You better come see me tomorrow. I will tell you. Don’t you worry. I will tell you. It is a wrong idea they want to suffer. What to do? Do one thing. Take two sticks and give them. Now hit each other and suffer. (people are laughing in the audience). To such stupid people what should we do? They want to suffer. There is one fellow, who told me, a radio man, that everybody has a right to suffer. I said, alright if you want to suffer, go to some place far away and kill yourself. Why bother everyone with your suffering? It is a sadism isn’t it ? I am suffering, I am suffering, I am suffering… Who has asked you to suffer? Shri Mataj is is smiling and drinking some water. Have you met such wonderful people?... hahhha… that you have to enter into the Kingdom of God, promised that, and you want to suffer? There must be something wrong with you / them? They must be possessed, otherwise I can’t explain this. That you want to suffer, why? It is like a man who is rich, wants to say: I want to become poor and starve myself. In the name of GOD, again. Some people torture others in the name of God, some people torture themselves in the name of God. What do you say to that? What a wonderful understanding of life.

So now, it is very simple for you to get your realization, normally. Normally… You have to do one simple thing, first of all, is to take out your shoes. I am sorry, it is rather cold down. But you have to. Because it is Mother Earth will help us. And it is very good we are very happily on the Mother Earth. Seldom get such a chance. If it is not very cold you can put your feet on the Mother Earth. We take help from all the elements. To put the elements within us first of all,alright. Now you put your both the hands towards me, just like this. Now why we are doing it? Because as I told you, your hands are to be enlightened. The chakras are five, six and seven within you. (Shri Mataji is showing the chakras on Her right hand.) And these 7 chakras must be enlightened. And the message passes through your hands to the Kundalini and She rises spontaneously, as a seed sprouts, it just rises. And that has to happen to all of us. It is very simple. There are so many who are Realized Souls here. They have got it the experience, and you all should get it.

There is some noise from the outside. And Shri Mataji asks: “What is that?”. Audience starts laughing.

A lady says: “They want realization.” And laughters continue.

A gentleman says: “It is a loud speaker for an election. There is a politician advertising himself, from loud speaker in the street. 

Shri Mataji: “Why are they shouting?”
From the audience: “Everybody would vote for them.”

Shri Mataji: Vote!...Vote.

A lady says: “Is it Indian politics?”… Laughter in the audience. Shri Mataji is also laughing.

Shri Mataji: “Same style… :) They are one better than the other. Nothing to choose. Alright. Just put your hands towards me. And you have to close your eyes. Please keep your eyes shot. That is important, because when the Kundalini rises, She touches the Agnya and the dilatation of the pupil takes place. But if the eyes are open, it won’t work out. Please keep your eyes shot till I tell you. Just… That much if you cooperate I will tell you later on what is to be done. Put both the hand towards me, stretched out. And keep your eyes shut. Now put your right hand on your heart. That is the place of your Spirit, and left hand towards me as it was. Throughout you have to keep the left hand the same way. Now after putting your hand there, you ask a question. With fill confidence you have to ask a question not hesitatingly, but with full confidence: “Mother am I the Spirit?” Ask the question: “Mother am I the Spirit?”

The audience asks the question out loud: “Mother am I the Spirit?”

Shri Mataji: “Again ask the question: “Mother am I the Spirit?””

The audience asks the question out loud: “Mother am I the Spirit?”

Shri Mataji: “Again ask the question.”

The audience asks the question out loud: “Mother am I the Spirit?”

Shri Mataji: “Now put this right hand up, on the neck again. On the, on the left hand side again, we are working on the left hand side. On the neck. And three times, just say… “Mother, I am not guilty.””

The audience repeats out loud: “Mother I am not guilty.”

Shri Mataji: “Again…”

The audience repeats out loud: “Mother I am not guilty.”

The audience repeats out loud: “Mother I am not guilty.”

Shri Mataji: “Now put back this hand, right hand down below on the stomach, on the left hand side. Again we are working out our chakras ourselves. Pressing it. All the fingers pressing in the stomack on the left hand side. Now ask the questions again…: Mother am I my own Guru?”
