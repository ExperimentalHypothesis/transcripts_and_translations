Om twameva sakshat Shri Savitrā [the god of the Sun] sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namaha x 3

Shri Mataji: What are you making here?

Yogi: Shivalinga

Shri Mataji: You make Shivalinga there, you can really make very complicated/ Ganesha, is really big, very complicated.

Yogi: Shivalinga here, Mother?

Shri Mataji:  On the left hand side, move the whole thing as a Kundalini. If you make the Ganesha that side... no, at that corner, then the whole thing can be used.

That side.  Make that.  That side, that side, has to be that side, on top of the...rock [unclear discussion] This half is done, a [white/wide] thing would be better.

[16:40 – 27:54 – no proper sound, only white noise]

[unclear comment from Shri Mataji]

Yogi: We learned it from a recording, Mother which we had.  It’s a very cheerful...

[sound of children playing and talking for several minutes. Unclear conversation]

Shri Mataji: [to the children] Mm, take these flowers, and put them in the sea. Come along.  Mm, good, good.  That one was a really good one, very good. Did you take your photograph?  Oops, did you fall down?

It’s getting very clear. The sea has got vibrations, from that side.  Can you see or not?

Yogi: No Mother.

Shri Mataji: I can see, very clearly. Yes, it’s coming out.

Yogi: What does it look like, Mother?

Shri Mataji: From the sea it’s rising, establishing, it’s coming up; the whole thing, coming up like that. Can you see in the sky? You can’t see? It’s very light.

Yogi: It’s very faint, it’s like rays.

Shri Mataji: This is the [unclear] vibrations. You see that, straight lines coming out.

Yogi: Streaks,

Shri Mataji: Streaks, streaks. It should come out from all over. It started that side, you see, all of them started... You see, they look a little...blue and light, you see now. It’s coming up now, can you see?

Yogi: A mixture of light and deep blue, yes.

Shri Mataji: All over they should come out.

Yogi: If you put your hand above your eyes like this, they can see it more strongly.

Shri Mataji: Maybe. I can see it [unclear/quite well], maybe for you people might be.  Now, can you see it?

Yogi: Move back?

Shri Mataji: I think this side is the South perhaps... maybe. You see it’s rising now again, and again...It starts from points and then goes up.

Yogini: I don’t think it’s close enough...

Shri Mataji: It’s now this side if you see, it’s moving now, it’s moving this way, you see, it’s coming over My head, you see.  Just see this side, can you, this part, yeah?

Yogi: Yes, yes Mother, I can see it... That’s going upwards, yes...

Shri Mataji: Just on My head it’s coming.

Yogi: Yes, You see, I’m looking straight over Your head.

Shri Mataji: It’s like that... It’s coming from this side, see, you see... like that it’s spreading.

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji These lines are because of that, you know. These lines of clouds are... you see, the whole thing... spreading.

Yogi The sky’s getting lighter and clearer too

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s becoming lighter, you see.

Yogi: [unclear] That blackness... is it...rain.

Shri Mataji: That will disappear more, it’s becoming lighter, see now...you can see that it’s going like that, spreading all over from that end. Like Shri Ram, towards Lord Shiva: towards the south.

Yogi: Mother, they seem to be coming down at an angle, that way, then that way. It seems as though they’re directing their attention down there.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no they are going up here.

Yogi: Yes, straight, but over Your head, right over.

Shri Mataji: They are all coming, you see this is the central point, you see. The whole thing just now it’s worked out. Clouds will be there.

Yogi: That’s... well, that seems to be south...

Shri Mataji: But they all will go over.

Yogi: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: This one is here, see now, can you see this one?

Yogis: Yes, yes, yes...

Shri Mataji: Just from there, see, in front. It’s just from there, you see, just see...

Yogi: Oh, look at the bird,

Shri Mataji: Just see the [unclear/beam] Can you see the [beam?]... Very clearly.

Shri Mataji: Beautiful, it’s clearing out.

[Yogis sing Shri Ganesha Aarti and Shri Mataji’s Aarti, Saba ko dua dena, followed by the three Great Mantras.]

Yogi: Mother, may we just sing the mantra of Nirmala Vidya for the whole of Australia?

7 x Om twameva sakshat, Shri Nirmala Vidya sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namaha

[unclear conversation with yogi. Shri Mataji asking for the puja things to be vibrated, and about Saturday/Saturn being the day for oil. No clear sound again for the last 7 minutes, just white noise.]

[Further info regarding this event: In 1983 one of the yogis mentioned to Shri Mataji that it would be a great blessing if Australia could be drenched with a heavy rainfall as the whole country was suffering drought and as a consequence bushfires were causing havoc in many parts of Australia because of the heat and dryness. In answer to our prayers, it was decided to have a puja at the seaside the very next day. We were only about fifteen yogis at the time and we found a wonderful quiet beach where we could see the city of Melbourne in the distance. Shri Mataji was seated on a flat rock — and we watched in awe — everything was silent. The sea began to react to the vibrations and started to rise and, with a wave of Her hand, She said, "Calm down, calm down. It's all right." And with that, the sea was still and calm. She then started drawing Shri Ganesha in the sand and slowly kept shaping His form over and over again for a very long time. Everything was peaceful and silent — just the gentle ocean lapping the sands. She offered Shri Ganesha flowers, kumkum, turmeric and rice and then the rejoicing words, "Now, after this puja, the whole of Australia will not suffer from drought anymore." We all bowed to Her Feet through the cool, salty seawater. It was absolute heavenly bliss.
At 4 am on the 20th March 1983, while we were preparing the garland for Her sixtieth birthday, suddenly the sky exploded with a crack of thunder and there it was — rain — torrents and torrents of it and it went on for days. During the puja She announced, "You see, your prayers are answered." The newspapers were headed with a full front page — "Miracle Rain." The whole of Australia, even Ayer's Rock [Uluru], was blessed with the heavenly rain.]
