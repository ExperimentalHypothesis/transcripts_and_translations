1989-12-27 India Tour - How We Should Behave

It was very interesting I was thinking about you all and about the people who have done so much for Sahaja Yoga. It is impossible really to say how many have worked for Sahaja Yoga with such interest and dedication. And this dedication is directed by divine force that's why I think you people are not even aware how much you have worked so hard without getting any material gain out of it. And the joy has no value. We cannot evaluate in any human terminology nor can we describe it as to how we feel the joy of oneness together. This togetherness is very much felt in Ganapatipule. I see the leaders from all over the world have become great friends - there's no jealousy, there's no quarrelling, there's no fighting, there's no domination, there's no shouting, nothing. Such beautiful brothers and sisters such a beautiful family we have created out of this beautiful universe.Now we have to maintain the beauty individually and collectively. Some people think that individually if you do something that is alright, but if it is not related to the collective it cannot be sahaj. Anything that you do has to be related to the collective. Now to be individualistic is a trend in the modern times and in that how far we have gone into nonsense that we know very well. Individuality is a personality within yourself which has to be of different hues, of different colours, of different beauties. Like if you see the flowers, now every flower is different and individual. In its beauty, in it's softness, in it's fragrance, in it's form, in it's colour every leaf is different, but they adorn the whole forest, the whole garden in such a beautiful manner that the whole thing works towards the collective. So the individuality is where we do not become like other people, exactly like military people as they are, the outside people may become like military people but inside you become individual in the sense everybody has a different way of pleasing others, of teasing others, of loving others of saying beautiful things. Everybody has a style of saying nice things and of offering your words of thanks and words of appreciation. This individuality is to be developed by all of you. That what is the new thing I can say to please. As people I have seen every day think ‘What fashion I should have, what sort of a fashion I should wear, how I should become more fashionable outside, if you can think ‘How can I be more fashionable inside myself’. In India fashionable has a different meaning. It doesn't mean the way we know in England. I think many people don't know that in England fashionable means popular. Here fashionable means out of the blue, something special, something extraordinary is fashionable here.So if we could put our attention to this, how we could be more beautiful inside, when we are touching others hearts, how we could be very pure in our expression, genuine in our expression, not artificially. Like we have seen also that even we are superficial you'll say ‘Thank you very much, thank you very much, thank you very much’ and you don't mean it, it's just a lip service you don't mean it. But in Sahaja Yoga when you want to thank you see it is really heart felt you say it from your heart, you have to put your hand on your heart otherwise you just can't say it, it is that way that we should feel and once you open that heart fully, opening of the heart is very important and that, unless and until you can do it you cannot enjoy anything in Sahaja Yoga because the heart where resides the Spirit and it is the Spirit that emits the joy. So if you do not have an open heart, and if you are just living on very superficial level you can never enjoy Sahaja Yoga, and this enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga is something to be really achieved and to be enjoyed. Because that's why you are here for, there's nothing else to offer in Sahaja Yoga but the joy of life, and that is the essence of all the achievements of life. Everything we do for the joy but everything whatever we do for joy after some times we find it becomes a sort of a reaction. So there is very important point that to make our individuality beautiful we should not immediately react to people, should not give our own opinion ‘I don't like it, I don't want it’, but we should absorb the beauty of another person. Now supposing there's a flower you get, immediately you will see the beauty of the flower, you like to take the fragrance of the flower but suddenly you say ‘I don't like flowers’ then what can the flower do to you? So one should not react and one should not have such subtle idea about your likes and dislikes because it's a joy-killer habit, it's a joy killer. If you want to enjoy take enjoyment from every person like the bee which takes the honey from every flower you must develop that sweet personality within yourself and then only you will know what is sweet, what is good and the enjoyment from one person to another, from one collective to another, from one city to another, from one country to another will be just beautiful like a swing, it will be like a swing going up and down enjoying yourself, that's what is your real divine sensitivity. And the divine just wants to do that. It's working out so many ways of giving you photographs, giving you miracles, working it out, making you believe that you are in the Kingdom of God. But if you have all these angularities and if you have all these ideas about yourself then please try to neutralise them.Now some people also feel that Mother is angry with us or some sort of thing I can never be angry with you, for what should I be angry. But if you think like that forget it. First of all you must see that something wrong with you that's why I think like that, I must put myself right. So just to judge yourself through such ideas is only your mental projection it has nothing to do with your heart. So again today the first thing we have to know that in our heart lies the power to absorb, to enjoy the beauty of spirituality.There's a beautiful shloka which I had told Mahatmaji that he should put it first, I was a very small girl but he listened to me (Shri Mataji says it in Sanskrit). ‘Early in the morningI pray to that principle in my spiritWhich is the truth, the attention, and joySo that I should go to the highest state of my ascent.'[Pratarnamani udisanskura-aatm-tatvum,Sad-chit-sukham paramhansam gatim turyam’.]So, opening of the heart is very important for all of us.

I am sure that most of you understand Hindi very well, and also the English language.  For those who do not, I have a small message for all of you.  That we have to make our hearts very large, just like the sea.  When we come close to the sea, just as a drop dissolves and becomes the ocean, we also must make our hearts very big, and vast, like the ocean.

Translation from Hindi

Taking up small issues and making them into big misunderstandings, and fights, and those who get affected by unimportant things, they are very small hearted people.  We must realise that the joy that we get from spiritual upliftment, is way beyond the satisfaction from material things.  Many people ask Me, “ Shree Mataji, how do You adjust with all the discomforts, like living in the Watchman’s quarters; You sleep in any conditions; You use outdated toilet facilities”.  This is because these things which give body and mind comforts, are not important.  I am happy in situations which give comfort to the soul and the spirit.  And the joy which My Spirit experiences is dependent upon all of you.  If you reach the state of Atma Anand (Joy of the Spirit), My Heart will be filled with joy.

My only desire is that all of you should be in a state of spiritual joy, and remain always in that state of joy.  There is no outward sign or form, of the state of joy.  The state of joy can be experienced within.  It is a within happening, these waves of joy.  But when these waves of vibrations get triggered, and start flowing throughout the body, and covers the entire personality, and it seems as if the whole world is getting drenched in these vibrations;  that is the joy I am talking about.  But for that, one has to have a very large, all-encompassing heart.

Every one of you should enlarge your hearts, and you should merge into the joy that the  Paramatma (Almighty God) has designed for you.  May you imbibe this joy, and get dissolved into it.  This is not an impossible thing for Sahaja Yogis to do.  Because if you love Me, you know that My Love is bigger than the ocean.  And if you love Me, and want to enthrone Me in your heart, your heart has to be very, very large.  Because, if you do not expand your heart like the ocean, how can you accommodate Me in your heart?  You will only be able to fit a part of Me.  If you want to put the whole of Me into your heart, you will have to make it vast and limitless.

Sitting alongside the sea, this is what you should make up your minds, and request this ocean which is before you, to make you into the same unbounded, unlimited, ocean.  And the special characteristic of this ocean is, that it has great depth.  It covers the very bottom, the lowest depth.  There is nothing below it.  The ocean is always at the lowest point, and all the rivers of the earth come and empty themselves into it.  And as the rivers bring their volume of water and drop it into the ocean, she receives every river and allows it to empty itself into Her.

And the most wonderful thing is, that she allows the sun’s heat to boil this water and convert it into vapour, and from this again, showers of rain come down to quench the land where people live, and fulfil their requirements.  And again the rivers bring the water back, to fall into the ocean.  Suppose this ocean was placed atop a high mound, what use would it be to anyone.  And by this time it would have completely dried out!

In the same way, the man who has a large, expansive heart, remains at the deepest level.  He is unobtrusive.  He has no requirements or desires.  He just keeps receiving and absorbing.  This is the sign of greatness, and unlimited capacity.  The one who can absorb everything into himself, he is wide, and deep, like the ocean.

Just by a thought or an idea, if one claims that “I am like this ocean, and I feel that I am vast, it may not always be so.  Because ideas can delude.  It has to be a state.  When we are in that state, we are complete, and we are full of that joy.  It is only when we are at that depth, that we can draw everything into ourselves.  We can bear, and accommodate everything, and only then the waves of joy start breaking on the shores.

Today we are sitting before the ocean, and we should understand that the benevolence of the ocean is upon us; and when a person becomes the ocean, then he also becomes benevolent to the earth, and the people living on this earth.

This is My wish for all of you.  May all of you become great.  This is My Blessing on all of you.
