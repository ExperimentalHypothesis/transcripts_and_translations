[English Transcript]

Today, it was again a busy day, sorting out things for you. And it was very interesting I was thinking about you all and about the people who have done so much for Sahaja Yoga. It is impossible really to say how many have worked for Sahaja Yoga with such interest and dedication. And this dedication is directed by divine force that's why I think you people are not even aware how much you have worked so hard without getting any material gain out of it. And the joy has no value. We cannot evaluate in any human terminology nor can we describe it as to how we feel the joy of oneness together. This togetherness is very much felt in Ganapatipule. I see the leaders from all over the world have become great friends - there's no jealousy, there's no quarrelling, there's no fighting, there's no domination, there's no shouting, nothing. Such beautiful brothers and sisters such a beautiful family we have created out of this beautiful universe.

Now we have to maintain the beauty individually and collectively. Some people think that individually if you do something that is alright, but if it is not related to the collective it cannot be sahaj. Anything that you do has to be related to the collective. Now to be individualistic is a trend in the modern times and in that how far we have gone into nonsense that we know very well. Individuality is a personality within yourself which has to be of different hues, of different colours, of different beauties. Like if you see the flowers, now every flower is different and individual. In its beauty, in it's softness, in it's fragrance, in it's form, in it's colour every leaf is different, but they adorn the whole forest, the whole garden in such a beautiful manner that the whole thing works towards the collective. So the individuality is where we do not become like other people, exactly like military people as they are, the outside people may become like military people but inside you become individual in the sense everybody has a different way of pleasing others, of teasing others, of loving others of saying beautiful things. Everybody has a style of saying nice things and of offering your words of thanks and words of appreciation.

This individuality is to be developed by all of you. That what is the new thing I can say to please. As people I have seen every day think ‘What fashion I should have, what sort of a fashion I should wear, how I should become more fashionable outside, if you can think ‘How can I be more fashionable inside myself’. In India fashionable has a different meaning. It doesn't mean the way we know in England. I think many people don't know that in England fashionable means popular. Here fashionable means out of the blue, something special, something extraordinary is fashionable here.
So if we could put our attention to this, how we could be more beautiful inside, when we are touching others hearts, how we could be very pure in our expression, genuine in our expression, not artificially. 

Like we have seen also that even we are superficial you'll say ‘Thank you very much, thank you very much, thank you very much’ and you don't mean it, it's just a lip service you don't mean it. But in Sahaja Yoga when you want to thank you see it is really heart felt you say it from your heart, you have to put your hand on your heart otherwise you just can't say it, it is that way that we should feel and once you open that heart fully, opening of the heart is very important and that, unless and until you can do it you cannot enjoy anything in Sahaja Yoga because the heart where resides the Spirit and it is the Spirit that emits the joy. So if you do not have an open heart, and if you are just living on very superficial level you can never enjoy Sahaja Yoga, and this enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga is something to be really achieved and to be enjoyed. Because that's why you are here for, there's nothing else to offer in Sahaja Yoga but the joy of life, and that is the essence of all the achievements of life.

Everything we do for the joy but everything whatever we do for joy after some times we find it becomes a sort of a reaction. So there is very important point that to make our individuality beautiful we should not immediately react to people, should not give our own opinion ‘I don't like it, I don't want it’, but we should absorb the beauty of another person. Now supposing there's a flower you get, immediately you will see the beauty of the flower, you like to take the fragrance of the flower but suddenly you say ‘I don't like flowers’ then what can the flower do to you? So one should not react and one should not have such subtle idea about your likes and dislikes because it's a joy-killer habit, it's a joy killer.

If you want to enjoy take enjoyment from every person like the bee which takes the honey from every flower you must develop that sweet personality within yourself and then only you will know what is sweet, what is good and the enjoyment from one person to another, from one collective to another, from one city to another, from one country to another will be just beautiful like a swing, it will be like a swing going up and down enjoying yourself, that's what is your real divine sensitivity. And the divine just wants to do that. It's working out so many ways of giving you photographs, giving you miracles, working it out, making you believe that you are in the Kingdom of God. But if you have all these angularities and if you have all these ideas about yourself then please try to neutralise them.

Now some people also feel that, "Mother is angry with us" or some sort of thing. I can never be angry with you. For what should I be angry? But if you think like that forget it. First of all, you must see that something wrong with you that's why I think like that, I must put myself right. So just to judge yourself through such ideas is only your mental projection it has nothing to do with your heart. So again today the first thing we have to know that in our heart lies the power to absorb, to enjoy the beauty of spirituality.
There's a beautiful shloka which I had told Mahatmaji that he should put it first, I was a very small girl but he listened to me (Shri Mataji says it in Sanskrit). 
‘Early in the morning
I pray to that principle in my spirit
Which is the truth, the attention, and joy
So that I should go to the highest state of my ascent.'

[Pratarnamani udisanskura-aatm-tatvum,Sad-chit-sukham paramhansam gatim turyam’.]

So, opening of the heart is very important for all of us.

I am sure that most of you understand Hindi very well, and also the English language.  For those who do not, I have a small message for all of you.  That we have to make our hearts very large, just like the sea.  When we come close to the sea, just as a drop dissolves and becomes the ocean, we also must make our hearts very big, and vast, like the ocean.

[Translation from Hindi]

Taking up small issues and making them into big misunderstandings, and fights, and those who get affected by unimportant things, they are very small hearted people.  We must realise that the joy that we get from spiritual upliftment, is way beyond the satisfaction from material things. Many people ask Me, “ Shri Mataji, how do You adjust with all the discomforts, like living in the Watchman’s quarters; You sleep in any conditions; You use outdated toilet facilities”. This is because these things which give body and mind comforts, are not important.  I am happy in situations which give comfort to the soul and the Spirit.  And the joy which my Spirit experiences is dependent upon all of you.  If you reach the state of Atma Anand (Joy of the Spirit), my heart will be filled with joy.

My only desire is that all of you should be in a state of spiritual joy, and remain always in that state of joy.  There is no outward sign or form, of the state of joy. The state of joy can be experienced within. It is a within happening, these waves of joy.  But when these waves of vibrations get triggered, and start flowing throughout the body, and covers the entire personality, and it seems as if the whole world is getting drenched in these vibrations;  that is the joy I am talking about.  But for that, one has to have a very large, all-encompassing heart.

Every one of you should enlarge your hearts, and you should merge into the joy that the  Paramatma (Almighty God) has designed for you.  May you imbibe this joy, and get dissolved into it. This is not an impossible thing for Sahaja Yogis to do.  Because if you love Me, you know that my love is bigger than the ocean. And if you love Me, and want to enthrone Me in your heart, your heart has to be very, very large.  Because, if you do not expand your heart like the ocean, how can you accommodate Me in your heart?  You will only be able to fit a part of Me.  If you want to put the whole of Me into your heart, you will have to make it vast and limitless.

Sitting alongside the sea, this is what you should make up your minds, and request this ocean which is before you, to make you into the same unbounded, unlimited, ocean.  And the special characteristic of this ocean is, that it has great depth.  It covers the very bottom, the lowest depth. There is nothing below it. The ocean is always at the lowest point, and all the rivers of the earth come and empty themselves into it. And as the rivers bring their volume of water and drop it into the ocean, she receives every river and allows it to empty itself into Her.

And the most wonderful thing is, that she allows the sun’s heat to boil this water and convert it into vapour, and from this again, showers of rain come down to quench the land where people live, and fulfil their requirements.  And again the rivers bring the water back, to fall into the ocean.  Suppose this ocean was placed on top of a high mound, what use would it be to anyone?  And by this time it would have completely dried out!

In the same way, the man who has a large, expansive heart, remains at the deepest level.  He is unobtrusive.  He has no requirements or desires.  He just keeps receiving and absorbing.  This is the sign of greatness, and unlimited capacity.  The one who can absorb everything into himself, he is wide, and deep, like the ocean.

Just by a thought or an idea, if one claims that “I am like this ocean, and I feel that I am vast, it may not always be so.  Because ideas can delude.  It has to be a state.  When we are in that state, we are complete, and we are full of that joy.  It is only when we are at that depth, that we can draw everything into ourselves.  We can bear, and accommodate everything, and only then the waves of joy start breaking on the shores.

Today we are sitting before the ocean, and we should understand that the benevolence of the ocean is upon us; and when a person becomes the ocean, then he also becomes benevolent to the earth, and the people living on this earth.

This is my wish for all of you.  May all of you become great.  This is my blessing on all of you.

SECOND SPEECH

I was ready at six o’clock when Babamama came and bought some very important people to meet me and I was just ready but so happens doesnt matter, and I am anxious to see the little ballet these people from Delhi have arranged and the little children are going to now do it for you. I hope you all are meditating every morning and talking Sahaja Yoga, meeting each other and this is more to get together that we should all discuss about Sahaja Yoga, and find out what is the way we can do it better. Morning time I was thinking that we can allot it now to people who would like to have a sort of a they call it a brain trust sort of a thing, a conference. You could have it, of course day after tomorrow we are all very free, I’m sorry tomorrow is the puja but day after tomorrow we are free in the morning time and also 9th we are free. So you all could discuss and talk about things, and about what has happened in Satara district and all those things can be discussed among all of you, and it can be established that we understand Sahaja Yoga properly among ourselves. Many people do not know much about Sahaja Yoga, especially ladies. I think they have to know quite a lot. They just think they are in Sahaja Yoga so they are floating with the big flow of water. That’s not the way to know about Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga you must know precisely, must know what is there what is not there. So I would say that you could have a meeting tomorrow sometime or I’m sorry, day after tomorrow sometime, and could discuss about what is it and how it helps you, what are the chakras are any problems anything, we have all kinds of people here. So it should not be just entertainment but it should be more sort of a morning session for learning things. Now tomorrow is very important day for puja, all of you are expected to come here for the puja and I’m sure that it will help you all to achieve something in that puja. As it is you know that you have to go beyond your thoughts to absorb the vibrations. In your thoughts you get lost but once you are above the thoughts you get absorbed. Also most of the marriages have been fixed, but some people unnecessarily giving way to their conditionings or maybe unnecessary thinking and all that have tried to say no to certain people without any rhyme and reason, without any rhyme and reason, so it is nonsense. And such people we would say that should not apply any more because we have wasted so much time. Of course if they had some rhyme and reason one can understand, but without reason if you say we don’t want to marry that means is quite insulting to the other party. So if you have just said no because you feel from your heart and from your brain and from these things this is not the way to behave, and before saying no you should see me, and I would request you all of you to meet your fiancees and see for yourself. Even now there is time.
But if there is no reason for saying no, if there is no understanding about any point it is better to decide it now than to decide it later on, I’ve been telling you. Of course you have all the freedom to do it, but for no rhyme and reason you have no business to insult other people. So I would request you that even if you have any objection, even now please write it down, and give it to Yogi Mahajan, he has really worked very hard and you know we have no choice. You see it is very funny how so many marriages have come up, I didn’t expect even to fix 10 marriages because the age, and the heights and everything was so much from one extreme to another extreme. Moreover those ladies who have got children and all that is rather difficult because you find people who are not very happy about the situation, so they should not feel bad about it. We hope to see people who would love to have children. All such people should come forward and they should marry women who have children and look after them. But is difficult. In the same way for men also if they have some children or something there is a problem.
But one should not feel bad about it, one should know that we are here for our Sahaja Yoga, for our ascent and we have to rise higher. As it is you know one or two marriages do fail in Sahaja Yoga, and they create a lot of problems for me. But is this the way are you helping me? I’m helping you in so many ways, which is the way are you going to help me is to understand that if we are married let us try to improve ourselves. Of course, I would say that certain problems come only from one side not from both the sides, but whatever it is we have to understand that these marriages are not just for marriages but for something great to create a new progeny of realised souls, to emancipate human beings. There are many saints who want to be born on this earth, so it is important that if you are married in that understanding then you’ll try to see to the good points of others and not the bad points and should not see superficial things. If you are superficial it is better you don’t marry, but if you have any depth then you should understand you are marrying for something that is the concern of God’s work. I hope by this you will be able to sort out many of your problems. And then some people when they get married they just get headlong, absolutely they get lost into it. This is another stupid conditioning of romanticism. You are marrying because you are in Sahaja Yoga, you want to help the Sahaja Yoga, you would like to have a companion who will be helpful in Sahaja Yoga, but they get so headlong into it that I’ve seen many characters have been ruined and people have been spoilt. But in a way is good because this is Last Judgement. If by marriage, by temptations, by wrong doings, by conditionings if you have to go out, you have to go out.
I must tell you that also there’s very little place in the Kingdom of God. Unless and until you prove to be good Sahaja Yogis, there is no place for you, for mediocre there is no place. You have to serious, deep, seeking, dedicated Sahaja Yogis otherwise you have no place. If you are playing around only with your children, with your wife then alright, go ahead with it. You have to get out of that and you must know that by first and foremost attention should be on Sahaja Yoga. That is so very important today, formally that’s why people used to give sanyasa to their disciples – no marriage, no children, no household. Just be sanyasis so complete dedication to the Guru, complete dedication to the work, but in Sahaja Yoga it is not so because also I have given you realisation so you can feel it within yourself what is important. If something goes wrong with you then the vibrations also go down.
Then also I have reports say from many countries that people are very miserly, they do not donate for daily work. Of course you don’t have to pay me but you must know that without donation we cannot do anything, you cannot even buy a little thing like that (pointing to decoration) and from where it has to come? of course as far as possible I have tried to compensate but also you must know my husband is now retiring so I hope the whole, with his retirement, the whole of Sahaja Yoga will not collapse if you are such miserly people only worried about your money, you want to extract each and every pie you spend, each and every little money you have given then I must say such people are no good for Sahaj Yoga. Such calculating people, nobody wants to shell out. I mean I have seen people even if they give a little bottle of say ‘Limca’ to someone they want to charge it. If you are that miserly there is no place for miserly people in the Kingdom of God. You have to be generous, you have to look after people, you have to love each other, you have to give presents to others and you have to be very much giving. And in this I find that people will live in a good house, they will have a good family, they will spend on their children for their holidays, for their education, for everything but Sahaja Yoga they become very miserly. So they are still so conditioned.
So this is the Last Judgement and you will be judged for everything that you do for Sahaja Yoga. One has to be very careful as to how you behave, what is your attitude is and how you should change.
Your attention is also very important, if your attention is not there. I have seen some people still sitting outside, talking to people, doing this in between the program they just get up and walk off. When some artist is sitting you are not to go like that. It’s an insult to the artist, I just sit for hours together. And if I am supposed to be your Guru, you must learn at least that much from me how to respect and where to respect. So I have seen many people just getting up, walking, sleeping down, this that. If you are that kind then you should sit on the corner and just disappear. Nobody should walk this way, back and this one, it’s not proper. if you go to your church do you do like that? Church which is based on falsehood while this is the church of truth. And the way people take things without any discipline looks very funny. People start walking up and down, sitting the way they like. There’s no alertness about them. You must know when the music is on I am trying to spread vibrations through that music. But some people are dozing off, some people are walking and about. That is not a sahaja yogi, you have to be just smarten and smart. Like any, if you see a saint you see, if you see old saints we had their disciples used to be sitting straight before them for hours together.
Of course, I don’t say that you should sit here for hours together but if I’m sitting here you have no business to behave like this dog that runs about without knowing what he is doing.
We are all human beings and there is no reasoning behind it. I don’t understand, and there is no explanation needed, is the behaviour itself is wrong. Now anybody who has children and all that should sit on the other side. I would not like you to carry your children here and there when there is some program is going on. We have to show at least this much of discipline. So yesterday’s program was little bit of farce, perhaps maybe because some people really behaved in a manner that they should not have been. All such people who want to go like that should wait because in between the program we will give you some interval when you can go out.
So let us have a society, a proper beautifully built up collectivity which shows that we are very saintly people, we have poise, we have adjustments, we have understanding, we are doing everything in such a manner that it is all dignified.
Now also some people have a bad habit of raising their Kundalini in the program, suddenly giving bandhans, giving bandhans to themselves, bandhans to others, is nonsense. Just now I am there you don’t have to, just your desire, you just try to develop your desire power and just desire you something it will work. I mean I work like that and you should learn this trick how to desire. But desire should be pure desire. Then Kundalini works it out. I was in Kholapur and I was telling him, Yogi Mahajan, I want to buy those ‘chimtars’ for the, we should say all the countries Western countries and also the leaders, and just imagine they said that you can’t get them in Kholapur. And there they are, they have bought it and brought it. I mean it’s a small incident but there’s a thousand and one things I can tell you I have to just desire. I just desired that the Eastern Block must be cleared out, must be freed so a program of Sahaja Yoga, what you call it ‘Yoga Seminar’ was held in Russia and I told my husband and I told everyone I am going there to break the Eastern Block. I just told them. When I went there they gave me hardly any time but I broke it because the people who got realisation there were from all these countries and they just went and triggered it. So I told beforehand that this is my purpose, but I’m so intensely desiring anything in the same way if you have a pure desire about it, not from any malicious or some sort of a selfish attitude.
Like my brother, my sister, this is Indians have this greater problem, my wife this that, the wife will support the husband, the husband will support the wife nonsensical things will go on, but by this they are really taking them down, and you people also should not sort of have, because somebody is from say Switzerland. Swiss people will sit together it’s a very wrong thing to do. I have told one hundred times nobody from the same. Now I can see even it’s the same thing happening here.
English must sit together, and English have the worst habit in this that they must form a group, that’s their style is to have their group. So this is all is our conditioning, you see why I’m telling you that Sahaja Yoga is not going to benefit by you but you have to be benefited. So all these little little conditionings that you have you just judge yourself, are we doing like that, are we sitting, am I sitting next to a Swiss, am I sitting next to an English, run away. And then maybe that you think you can speak in the same language or whatever, no, let us sit away. The Delhi people will sit together, Bombay people will sit together and you ask them do you know this lady ‘No, who was she?’. I mean she was there, ‘No, I never met her’, because nobody wants to meet, nobody wants to talk, nobody wants to talk.
And it is to be understood that this is a place of pilgrimage, there’s no fashion show on, and one should not go about putting fashionable clothes and fashionable dresses, be humble about it. You see sometimes I am really shocked the way people are dressing up, it’s alright for pujas and all that you can come, but the way people are dressed up sometimes it’s surprising. You are coming here for what, for your meditation. So be in a simpler dress, in a simpler attitude, in a simpler mind.
Today I had to tell you because I have been noticing few things that you are missing the point. We are here for our ascent, we have come all the way pilgrimage is there for your ascent and for nothing else. We are here only for our ascent, for our joy for opening out ourselves and that is what we have to remember. I’m your Mother I have to tell you the truth because it is your benevolence that I want, that you all should become great foundations of Sahaja Yoga which is going to emancipate the whole world. Moreover anybody who is sick need not come to me. You can cure that person. You can yourself cure. The person who is realised soul can cure himself or herself or you can cure. What is the need to bring everybody to me, this is sick, that is sick, no need. Among yourself only you can have these things done and I think the doctors and all these people can have a little conference together and anybody who has problems can come and tell them what the problem is and can be done. So no need also to have doctors. We have some people here, very simple people who can help you a lot. So among yourself you should have and you should learn how to do it, how to raise the Kundalini, how to tie it up, how to clear the chakras, what’s wrong with you. Attention should be how I am going to achieve it. But the attention is not so high, so I would request you today that you please pay full attention to the program and enjoy and really try to develop that sensitivity of enjoyment. It is just you are clinging on to something which is not going to take you to the ocean of joy, alright.
May God Bless You.
