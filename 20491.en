Leader:  Dear Sahaja yogis and all the curious people who have come here to know about Sahaja Yoga, today is a very auspicious occasion, as today Shri Mataji Nirmala Deviji is with us here and will tell us about the Kundalini science and how its awakening happens. I know a few people who are sitting here are quite uncomfortable, due to lack of space. I seek forgiveness from them. I am extremely sorry for the lack of space but with the knowledge you will gain out of sessions with Shri Mataji, you will feel no discomfort with the knowledge shared by our Holy Mother. This assurance I can give you. Along with this I have no words to describe our merciful and loving Mother. I lack the words to express praise for Her. I don’t have words. From where should I start? How do I start Her praise? Mother is the source and reservoir of mercy and love who is sitting among us. Our old sages and hermits told us how the Kundalini awakening is a very, very difficult process and is attained with lots of practice. Shri Mataji has made this awakening so convenient. If you are really curious to know about it in a true sense, if you are seekers, then I assure you that before you leave this place you will attain your Self-realization. I would now like to excuse myself and invite Mother to come on the stage and, with her love and beautiful and love-filled voice, to satisfy the curiosity in your minds. Thank you.

Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth. Today I was thinking about which language to choose to communicate with you. Then I thought that I have given lectures in Marathi in Pune many times. So today I will give my speech in Hindi only because Hindi is our national language, though my mother tongue is Marathi, but then I think learning Hindi language is of utmost importance. So I seek apologies from the Marathi-speaking people. All the people who speak in Hindi and are literary, please forgive me if I make mistakes anywhere. This is one thing we all should understand: first, that language should be of love and the heart. Where the language is not of the heart, it is only a word trap. The problem arises everywhere. So only the language which comes from the heart is touching and has impact.

We have been searching for the truth for many, many long years. It’s not about nowadays, since for many decades we have been searching for the truth, and in this search for the truth, many people have lost their paths. We should understand that the reason behind this is that today’s New Age environment and conditions are such that everyone talks about God and talks about dharma, and everyone creates such ruckus, speculation and drama in the name of God. This question arises in the young generation, and they keep on asking Me over and over again, “What does all this drama in the name of God mean?” They ask me over and again, “Mother, if God is truth, if God is love and if God is benevolence, then do the people fighting in the name of God have any mercy of God in them or do they have any godliness in them?” In this case, it is better to forget the people who in the name of God have created such a great nuisance. Because of these kinds of people, there is a major conflict occurring in our young generation today: how to deal with God and godly things.

Whether you believe it or not, God exists. It’s not about whether you believe or not. The existence of God will be there whether you believe in it or not. But it is difficult to understand why human beings start to move in wrong directions, where even if you search for God you will not be able to find God. If we try to understand where we went wrong in our search, we will be able to see that.

Now, talking about Sahaja Yoga. This means Sahaja; “saha” plus “ja”. “Saha” means with you and “ja” means since birth; that is, the one which is born with you for the arrangement of yoga, the device of yoga within you. This is assurance for you, to prove that the time has come to attain the truth.

Sahaja Yoga is not today’s thing. Thousands of years before, Lord Indra was given his Self-realization. Self-knowledge was granted then. Also, Sahaja Yoga existed, and after that you know Markandeya Swami was born 14,000 before in this world. He has also shared the importance of Sahaja Yoga, but this knowledge was never shared very openly. After that, long long ago, we can say that Shri Adi Shankaracharya openly shared this knowledge with mankind. In spite of this, it was never disclosed how this happens, because the time was not right then. Lord Krishna also said that you should know your spirit. Only the one who knows the spirit knows the truth. Christ said the same thing, that you should have your rebirth. Lord Buddha said it. Mahavira said it. Everyone said that you should get your rebirth, and this was openly shared by Shri Adi Shankaracharya, that without rebirth you have no other way to achieve God. Till you get the flow of divine vibrations in your hands, he said to them, “Salilum, Salilum.” Till then this word trap will not be removed. Most openly, this knowledge was shared by Guru Nanak and Shri Kabir Das Ji. Both of them tried really hard and kept the truth in front of everyone, that without Kundalini awakening no work can be done. But the way they mentioned it was so dynamic and powerful that people could not understand them. I also felt very strongly that until you give people their Self-realization, it is useless to talk about the Divine to them. Just like when “Geeta” was written, and people kept on just reading it and got ruined. Many more scriptures were written, and people kept on getting ruined. But now is not the time to act, read and talk about it, and I gave a lot of thought to it and tried to understand all these flaws in human beings and what the troubles are that man is facing that he is unable to achieve the Divine. After spending lots of time on this problem, I realized that if I opened the Sahastrara in a simple way, everything would be all right. So in the same way, this Sahaja Yoga of ours is established.

Now you should understand that this is a living process within us. Just as we have evolved from amoeba to human beings, now we have to evolve from human beings to superhuman beings; that, too, through a living process. There is no artificiality in this, no word trap, no exercise required, or the need to change clothes to saffron, or to live a detached life. This is totally an internal process. Like if you want to sprout seeds, then you have to put them in Mother Earth’s heart. You have to add it to Earth’s stomach. Then they will sprout very quickly and spontaneously. Can any of you say this? You cannot tell how one flower is transformed into fruit. This is how Sahaja Yoga is definitely a unique phenomenon. How it happens, we can share with you because all the works related to human beings should be known, and within you all lies the power called Kundalini which is residing within you in the triangular bone. Only with the rising of this power can you get the knowledge of your spirit.

The strange thing is that while he was writing “Gyaneshwari”, which is based on “Geeta”, Gyaneshwaraji explained in the sixth chapter the details about the Kundalini power within us. He explained it in a very beautiful manner and then he explained it further that when the Kundalini awakens, how individuals will benefit. “Quote in Marathi”, which means that all you desire you will get, but your desires change your desires. Also, the manner in which you desire changes completely.

Now, this Kundalini is present in each one of us, and now these scientists ask Me, “How do you know we have a Kundalini within us?” I know it’s completely up to you to believe it or not. Even if you are a scientist you should keep your mind open. You should have open-mindedness. If there is no open-mindedness, you can never be a scientist. We are putting in front of you a hypothesis. If we prove it, it becomes a law. In the same way, Kundalini is a very deep thing to understand, and to attain this deep knowledge please keep your mind open. If from the beginning you hold a stick, then how will I be able to explain all this to you?

I have noticed that all these works happen only in the Divine Kingdom. If you are going to a college or university, you try really hard to get admission to it. You make the best possible worldly efforts to get admission, and you bow down to every knowledge shared by your teachers in the class, thinking that all the knowledge they are disseminating is right. But I have noticed that all the saints and sages who came in this world to share true knowledge, we have troubled and tortured them all. We did not give them a proper hearing and kept on troubling them. We questioned and argued with them and troubled them. This is not how you can attain true knowledge. To attain this knowledge, the foremost thing is that “I don’t know about this and I want to know about this knowledge”. All the renowned saints have written about this knowledge in all the known scriptures of the world. If you read what Ramdas Swami has written, that nothing you will gain by reading something over and again. Our very famous Kabir Das has written, “Pari pari pandit murakh bhaya”. He has written it so clearly. Many more things are written by these saints so clearly. It is very surprising that we read their scriptures and do exactly what they have asked us not to do. I will now tell you the reason why we do it, why this happens and how by doing this, our religion gets converted into irreligion.

The Kundalini power is the pure desire, meaning all other desires are impure. If those desires were pure, then we wouldn’t crave for another thing when one desire is fulfilled. Our laws of economics state that all the desires are not easily achieved, meaning they cannot be satisfied, in general. This means you will get one thing in particular, but immediately you will have a new desire, then a third desire. The reason for this is that you do not have a pure desire. The desire you want to get fulfilled is not pure; it’s impure. Kundalini power is the desire which has made this body, and it is sitting within us. It is in a dormant state within us. It has not reached the stage of manifestation when it can show its effects. This pure desire is sitting within us in our triangular bone in our spine. We call it Kundalini, as it is sitting within us in three and a half coils. Now, why is it sitting within us in three and a half coils? The mathematics behind this I cannot share as we lack time, but if you listen to my lectures I have explained it in pure details.

Now this Kundalini power is the pure desire. So the first thing when this pure desire gets awakened is that it passes through our chakras, keeps itself detached and replenishes our chakras. If you see it logically it is the right thing. If the juice or sap of a tree while travelling up from the root gets stuck or sticks to any place, the tree dies and so does the process. Similarly, when the Kundalini within us rises and grows, this pure desire fades away other desires and removes them.

On the contrary, our entire system was opposite to this when we moved towards religion. Firstly, when we start moving towards religion or anything, we seek for our physical needs, the material things we can get from our spirituality. “Now I am following a religion, what benefits can I get from my religious life?” Let us snatch money from other people, take away their money and then slowly, slowly we make things out of spirituality which are totally heinous and hell. The attention goes towards the body. It is clear that if man’s attention is on his physical wellbeing, he is away from his pure desires. This is very clear. Then you change your attire, your identity, you do all sorts of worldly things. By doing all these things, your innate religion cannot be established within you. So that is why the human race kept on wandering.

Now the most catching problem of humans, which is very strong, is that they are mental, psychic and argumentative. You all know one such rationalist who really troubled Shri Adishankaracharya. It has been observed since long that these rationalists never understand their own conditioning. They get stuck on one thing they have studied once. If a man reads “Geeta”, he starts thinking of himself as Sage Vyas; “If not more, than at least I am equivalent to  Sage Vyas”. If someone has read the Bible he starts thinking that he knows the most about Lord Jesus. This kind of intellectual catch leads to more questioning. The entire Christian religion has come to an end due to these intellectual catches. Now, understand how this kind of intellectual catch came into them. When Lord Jesus came on this Earth he said, “Get your new birth.” Then Nicodemus said, “Do I go back to my mother’s womb?” Jesus then said, “No. What comes out of the womb is flesh but one who is born out of spirit, born out of Shri Adi Shakti, is the spirit, and without knowing your spirit you cannot attain godliness.”

Now, these people thought, “We cannot understand this process,” as none of them knew how to give Self-realization. Nevertheless, if they didn’t know how to give Self-realization they should not have made such a mental mess. They made such a mental mess of the process of Self-realization that a man named St Paul who had no connection with Christianity – he never met Jesus and was an epileptic – was in bad health, and according to Me he had some problems with his supra-conscious. He came and made his place in the Bible. When I first picked up the Bible I asked, “Who is this man?” Not only Me; many people said the same thing, like Kahlil Gibran. Also you must all know a renowned writer, William Blake who is a known seer, who also said, “How has he [St Paul] made his place in the Bible?” Now you made his place in the Bible, and all he has written, Christianity has approved of it. Now this has led to such a situation that an intellectual researched it and realized that Paul had not written anything about the birth of Jesus. He didn’t mention anything about his mother, either. Nor did he mention anything about the miracles Jesus did. He [Paul] then said that all the disciples of Jesus were fishermen who used to catch fish and kill fish for a living. They had no sense. They wrote all this based on what was in their minds. To all this controversy the Bishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said they support this theory. Now either you follow Paul or you follow Jesus.

Now when the Bishop of Canterbury approved of it – that now Jesus was born is incorrect and the miracles He did are also incorrect – now Mr. Paul stands correct. Later, this Paul was born as Augustine and he made Christianity only a mental, discursive kind of religion. He believed that even if you have to hold a gun in your hand, ensure the rest of the world takes up Christianity. To be Christian means is to be a Sahaja Yogi, to be a yogi.

The same goes for Muslims. All the things that were written by the Prophet Mohammad were twisted so much and made the religion Islam. The same condition is with Hindus, but the Hindus’ condition is the worst. They have segregated into so many religions within Hinduism. I don’t know when we will stop doing all this. First thing is that it’s mentioned clearly that everyone has an Aatma [spirit] within them. Then from where do caste and sect come? Caste and religion have no meaning. It was made according to the professions you do. Since they have started to segregate people from birth, this problem has started. It is not possible to have a religion from the time of birth.

The one who wrote “Geeta” was Sage Vyas. We all know who Sage Vyas was. He was the son of a fisherwoman who was not even married. Can he be a Brahmin? Sage Valimi who wrote “Valimi Ramayana”, who was he? All the big people who wrote scriptures, who are they? Brahmins are those who know Brahma [truth]. Those who do not know Brahma cannot be called Brahmins. But we are Brahmins from birth, whatever work we do. By birth we are Brahmins, and it’s done. Now even our elections are based on caste and religion. God save this country. I don’t know what is going to happen to this country, because caste is that in which you are born.

“Jaatii” means “Sahaja”, meaning what you have within, and Sahaja is what you have within you. That feeling within you that is searching for God is Brahmin, and the one who finds pleasure in business is Vaisya. This is how the caste system in India developed. And this caste system was given such importance, that we say Gora Kumhar [potter] in Maharashtra. This is such a good image of the caste system that Gora was called Kumhar. Tukaram said it would have been a good idea if were a Mahar [untouchable community in Maharashtra]. Again and again, all the saints have attacked the idea of the caste system in India. Not only this, Gyaneshwar was tortured by whom? All these people who thought of themselves as intellectuals and who thought they were big messengers of God, killed him by their dirty tricks, and today all those messengers are rewriting the “Gyaneshwari”, worshipping him and making temples in his name. This happened because people were more indulgent in their brains than on the spirit. Spirit should be given priority. All the saints said to recognize your spirit.

Namdev Sahib who is the renowned poet of Maharashtra was a very highly enlightened soul. He has written a very beautiful poem which was given a place in the Sikh holy book, “Guru Granth Sahib”. Shri Guru Nanaka recognized it and placed it there. It explains that a man who is in union with God gets into a state that his attention is like a child who is flying a kite and the kite has taken its full flight, flying in full swing in the sky [Bharari - Namdev used this Marathi word]. Now, this boy is talking as well to his friends, running back and forth, but his entire attention is on his kite. The second thing he mentioned is that when women are returning back after fetching water in pots placed on their heads, walking really fast, talking among themselves, their pots are stable on their heads. They are giggling among themselves but their attention is stable on the earthen pots on their heads. The message from this example is that all the people who talk about religion should first get their Self-realization. Otherwise, they have no right to attain their spirit, and by no chance they can say that they are realized souls. They may claim to be realized or get self-certified, but the proof here is that a self-realized person has collective consciousness within him. He should have collective consciousness. However much he self-certifies, if he has no collective consciousness, he is not self-realized. It becomes even more important that the people who take care of religion or who are messengers of religion should be self-realized. To discuss the issues of religion is also the right [of realized souls]. Those who have not got their enlightenment, enlightenment of the spirit, what will they say about it? They are standing in the dark and will discuss only the darkness. How will a blind man guide us regarding the color and skill displayed? First open your eyes, and this eye-opening happens only with spiritual enlightenment. It is written in “Geeta” “आत्मने वत्माने तुष्ष्ठ”. The Spirit gets satisfied only with spirituality.

The third kind of catch is even worse, in which a man gets emotionally attached to someone. Sometimes we consider that emotional attachment as faith. This is not faith; this is being blindfolded. Blind faith, like when Lord Jesus came, people claimed, “We follow Moses.” By then Moses was dead. “Moses is now our favorite. We don’t follow Lord Jesus.” Like the Jews said, “We do not follow Lord Jesus. We will only follow Moses.” Now by then Moses had died. “Moses said that we should suffer. So, we will have to suffer,” but with the advent of Lord Jesus all our sufferings were going to end. They said, “No, we will suffer.” So to make suffering, Hitler came to earth. Now suffer. This was one basic difference that we should suffer. What you were taught in the name of God is that you have to undergo circumstances, wrong expectations, sadness and torture.

The human body is not given to you for this. Even when you were born the entire pain of delivery was taken by your mother. It’s not the right thing to say. In Maharashtra it’s believed that on Monday they will fast, on Tuesday they will fast for a different reason. Then on Wednesday another kind of fast. In our country there are so many people already fasting. Why are you fasting? It is such a habit in India to fast, especially on the  birthday of any of our deities. Like on Sankashti, the  birthday of Lord Ganesha, people will fast. Would you fast on the day a child is born in your house? Wouldn’t you distribute sweets? Everything that is taught is the opposite of reality. This kind of belief, that with this kind of emotional trouble and torture you attain God, is a wrong belief, just like Shia people do. This is the biggest misconception they are living with. On the contrary, those who are happy-minded people attain the Divine easily.

Like in English it is said, “Count your blessings one by one”. The one who thinks about the blessings showered upon him is the one who achieves the Divine, not the one who always puts oneself into pain. Imagine if a mother sees her child is dying from hunger. This would be the saddest thing for the mother. She would say, “What’s the sense of me being alive when my child is dying from hunger?” For a mother, nothing can be more painful than seeing her child hungry. If you feel like fasting, it’s okay. You can do it, but do it for improving your health. Don’t do it in the name of God.

This is a kind of emotional thing that, “I am a sad person”. The second emotional feeling is that, “I have a lot of faith in God”. When Shri Ram came on this Earth people said, “We do not believe in Ram. We believe in Parshuram.” When Shri Krishna came people started to say, “We believe in Shri Ram.” Now, if someone else incarnates, people will say, “We believe in Lord Krishna.” Is Krishna standing in front of you today? You should think about who is standing in front of you.

We have no tendency to live in the present. People prefer staying in the past and become passionate about these feelings. Then we notice that both kinds of people – intellectuals and emotional people – become fanatics. This fanaticism gets stuck to one emotion. This emotion then gets stronger and stronger, but it’s a blind faith. It’s a blind faith that the pure desire of these human being gets destroyed, exactly like a river flowing through, that enters a pile of sand and gets finished there.  Similarly, our pure desire to attain union with God gets disturbed and vanishes here and there. Due to this kind of blind faith, we had huge losses, really huge losses, and the biggest loss is that now we are so separated and so fragmented and we are spread now. There is no provision to bind people together. We live lives which are very secluded and separated from each other. We are living a divided life, but when our evolution happens, we rise higher in our evolution. When we rise higher and higher in our Ascent, then we should attain integration. We should integrate. If we do not integrate we should understand we are just scattering. We should try everything possible to integrate. To integrate, the most important thread is your spirit. When you attain your spirit, when your Kundalini is enlightened by the light of your spirit, then everything unimportant falls off, and human beings can see the beauty of others as well.

After Self-realization, humans realize in collective consciousness that there is no other as an identity, there is no one separate as an identity. We are all one. When we all are part and parcel of the same God, then who is the other? We are not doing a favor for any one else. We are all one in identity. We are all the hands, feet and eyes of the same body. With our own hands we are harming our eyes or cutting our nose with the other hand, cutting our ear with one hand, and then holding one ear in another hand and claim that we are religious and the other one holding the nose will claim, “I am religious”. There is never a tiny bit of religiousness in this.

Any human being who is into fanaticism about religion should know that there is no religiousness in it, until you have integrated knowledge in you which comes only with enlightenment of the Spirit. Not a single saint or sage ever said that you should not achieve the enlightenment of your Spirit. Otherwise, if anyone had said, “Don’t achieve your enlightenment,” people would have been claiming that wrong statement only. It is a complete divine blessing that this never happened. God has suffered a lot at the hands of humans and kept saying, “Achieve your enlightenment and attain union with the spirit.” To attain our union with the spirit we do many things. In Sahaja Yoga we see diverse kinds of people come in to Sahaja Yoga. In different countries, many corrupt people from India moved abroad and claimed to be big saints and fooled innocent people abroad. They claimed such stupid things, such as, “If you take drugs you can attain God.” Innocent people from abroad took to drugs for that reason. They have such blind faith in these fake gurus. If someone says, “You get naked and you will attain God,” people accept nudity as well. This is how everywhere you look around you will notice that there is blindness in the name of God. Every fake guru is trying to push every blind seeker into a well. When the well is filled with twenty-five seekers there is the possibility of all the seekers becoming enraged, and conflict can happen. People can fight and there can be violence. Fake gurus put innocent seekers in a well and sit over them, claiming their lordship over them, “I am head of the monastery, Pope of the place,” or claim, “I am the leader of any other religion.”

Even auspicious things like Zen, which was started by Vidhitama, is a very higher order in spirituality, and he used to talk at a very higher state in spirituality, but I noticed the Kundalini of the head of Zen was not awakened. I asked him, “You are not even realized. How are you Zen?” Zen means “the one who knows”. I asked him, “How can you be here? How is this possible?” So he said, “We only have twenty-six Kashyapas, and after that we had no Kashyapas. How can I be a Kashyap? This all ended in the 12th century with a total of only twenty-six realized souls [Kashyap].” I asked him, “Then why are you sitting on that status? You are sitting on that title, but what is your right to sit on that status?”

A similar thing happened with the Vedas. In the Vedas the very first shalok says that the one who gets his understanding of his self or attains his Self-realization, only he has the right to access the Vedas. The one who has no knowledge of his self, who is ignorant about his self, what will he do with the Vedas?

Now what is “Vida”? It means to understand the self, to understand the consciousness lying within oneself. In English it means to understand our own central nervous system. If we do not understand the knowledge on our central nervous system, then it is not “Vid”. All that we have gained in our evolution has to be felt on our central nervous system. After attaining your Self-realization, what are the benefits? I am short of words to describe that, but tomorrow I will definitely share the benefits of attaining the self. There are numerous and endless benefits. I can’t tell you how much, because every human being first looks out only for his benefits. As a mother, I know that my children will first ask for a chocolate and then will listen to Me. So I will share the benefits of Self-realization, that while you are growing how you can benefit others as well. When others are benefited, when other people profit, then we realize what we have achieved in Sahaja Yoga. Before that, you realize that you are selfish. “I am meant for myself. I care only about myself and cannot help others.” When you start sharing it with others, it’s then you start enjoying it the most.

In India lot of issues are debatable, issues related to the incarnations, but no one knows the reality of it. For example, in “Geeta” there was no description about Kundalini because it was not the right time for awakening, but he made it clear that “Yoga kshema vahamayam”. First you attain your realization. Then the wellbeing will happen. This kind of belief system has been followed in our country for ages, which is giving yoga to people. In Maharashtra the Nath community provide the same work of kundalini awakening to the people but only one or two people used to get their Self-realization at that time. Merely one or two. Like during the time of Raja Janak, only Nachiketa got his Self-realization; that, too, after lots of tests. Even now, few gurus are there who can do this job of giving Self-realization. Earlier, only one or two people used to get Self-realization, as back then our tree of dharma had just started to grow. It was the beginning of its growth. So only one or two flowers had blossomed, but wherever such great people existed, we have twisted their teachings and learnings and made cults and religions out of their preaching, in which there were physical, mental or intellectual limitations, and there was no religion in it.

Religion brings complete balance in human beings. Religion has to bring complete balance in human beings. If there is no balance in the human beings then he is not religious. If he is out of balance, he has wasted his efforts. Religion is given only for the balance, as if you have to ascend, the first thing you will attain is balance. If there is no balance their roots will not grow deep in religion, and the garden of religion will not blossom. But instead we don’t check upon our balance. We are unable to attain balance as we live in a logical world or we live in some kind of blind faith, or we are busy in some kind of physical prayers with which the true religion doesn’t come with us. The first thing is to balance yourself. See within, what is balance within you. And when you want to achieve the balance within yourself, do not go to any kind of extremes. The wisdom itself starts sprouting within yourself, and the biggest thing for us, Indians, is that this is very saint land of yoga. It is a very pure land. It is such a big thing that you are born on this land. This you may not know.

Once I was returning back here from London. On my way back, the moment we touched India’s land I told my husband, “We have touched India’s land.” He said, “How you know?” I asked him to enquire from the pilot. The pilot confirmed that just a minute back we entered into the skies of India. I could see vibrations everywhere. This happens only in India, and what should I say about the land of Maharashtra, that when Shri Ram came to this land, even he entered this saint land barefooted to respect this land. This pure land has given birth to numerous saints and sages but we have made a hypocrisy out of all their teachings. Every religion taught you to be your own master. Being your own guru doesn’t mean that a crooked fellow who was released from jail and who wore a saffron dress claims to be a guru. You have to be a true guru – satya guru – and it is said that a true guru helps you attain God. A guru will help you attain union with God. Here, every person is claiming to be a guru. It doesn’t reflect on their faces that they are gurus. You can count the wrinkles on their faces. Their faces look like they are about to die. They are suffering from many diseases. If not this, then other kinds who snatch money from other people’s pockets and teach them bad things, teach them things which are non-religious. It is good that most of the so-called gurus have migrated to the USA. They should grow there only. In that culture they can grow rapidly. In this holy land of India they cannot grow. They may work here for a while but then they will have to leave this land. They cannot work here.

Another thing which we are very proud of is that we have a very rich heritage and culture, and it’s a very great thing because this culture always leads to Divinity. I still remember when we were young my mother used to say to us, “Lakshay Kutte”, “Where is your attention?” to restrain our attention from wavering. This is very well explained in our scriptures. It is taught from childhood to children, to stop your imagination or to restrict your attention from wandering. The cultures abroad, believe Me, are trying their best to finish the human race on Earth. The first thing is to destroy his attention, then to destroy his purity, and fill him with filth and snatch away his money, till you have some weaknesses. How will their industries work? They create industries which uselessly take money from people. So people can be befooled and looted until they are scraped from Earth.

You notice even science today is stupid, in that we worked so hard and then produced what? Atomic bomb. That will only destroy us; it will only be the end of us. Why have we created these kinds of things? What is the logic behind it, as we have those powers also residing within us which are dead. We want to become the spirit, and the dead energies within us are trying their best to make us dead again. It’s very easy to get inclined towards dead things. Similarly, going upwards in evolution is difficult, and coming down to the dead is easy. Falling down is easier. That is why human beings easily get attracted towards falling down. How can you be saved from getting drowned by the dead things? It’s only our Indian culture that lifts you above and raises you high. It raises you higher in every aspect. Your aim in this life is to rise higher in evolution. The rest of the life is zero, it’s pointless and it has no meaning. The life which takes you higher and higher, much higher in your thoughts, that life is the true life that is worth living. The remaining aspects of life are false, and we should leave them as soon as possible.

All the saints and sages have worked hard on this land, but when I took birth I saw that people were running after all the saints and sages badly and troubling them. A new thing now is that intellectuals have come up with a new thing, that “Saundaraya Lahiri” was not written by Shri Shankaracharya. Communist people claim that Shri Shankaracharyaji was bogus and hollow in his preachings.  People perused them obsessively, when they were alive. Now when they are dead, people still do not spare them. This is because people who are after them still haven’t got rid of their egos. The desires stuck to their egos are still troubling them. We should try to get rid of that ego. Once you stand up and quit ego, you will see your wellbeing is only in this. Your good is only in this, and your ascent lies only in this. This is what he should attain. The rest is all useless. For those useless things in the past, we argued, fought and intellectually differentiated over points of view. At last he realizes, “Oh my God! How much time I have wasted over such mundane thoughts.”

You all should get this benefit, the benefit of the spirit. You attain your spirithood. This is my pure desire, and you get to know God. When you get close to God just remember that you are a sprout, and this enlightenment is just like the seed has sprouted. It’s up to you to either destroy this sapling or to nurture it into a tree, but with full humility. Leave your stubbornness, and then in humility let this grow within you and understand how it grows within you. Few people have grown so high in this. They have grown in so many ways, crossed so many stages in this growth, and a few are still struggling at the beginning point. It is surprising how some people progress in Sahaja Yoga and some are still struggling at the initial stage. Even this should be considered that after attaining this, whatever is our position in life, how rich or poor we may be, after attaining spirit we all are at the same level. After this, we should work to increase our level in spirituality and grow higher. Those who are rich and those who are poor are all the same. I don’t feel there is much difference between them, but it is better that you come to a certain level and attain your spirit.

Without enlightenment, poverty in your country won’t go away; nor will problems like black-marketing; nor will the flaws in administration go away. The lawlessness and all the problems will vanish with enlightenment, and without this there is no other way to clear these problems out. Human beings should ascend. After all, these problems are caused only by human beings. The human beings will be cured, his spirit will get enlightened, and if he understands the love of God then you see how much this world will change. The whole country will change but the sad thing here is how many people want to transform themselves. People think, “It’s a small life. Let’s just make the most money and material wellbeing in this time only. Life is too long to attain the eternal life. Living life for two or a few more seconds to the fullest will not make any difference.”

So to all you people here, I humbly request you that I am a mother and the true meaning of my existence is that you understand this fact to attain your enlightenment, that now the time has come for ascent from human to superhuman beings. This is the last jump in our evolution. We get enlightenment into our collective consciousness. We get enlightenment in our spirit, and to attain our spirit the time has come. There is no fun missing this chance of getting enlightenment. Also there is no fun keeping people in any sort of misunderstanding. What has happened has happened. Forgive everything and dive into this infinite love of God. You should enter into the Kingdom of God.

Pranams.

If you have any questions, please ask. Please ask only one or two questions at the most. Don’t ask too many questions and also do not take up arms against me. I am not here to trouble you in any respect.

(Mother talking to a leader) Let them ask questions Otherwise, they will disturb us during the realization process.

Leader asking the audience: Are there any questions?

Question from the audience: What is the difference between true knowledge and yoga?

Leader: Any other questions? Does anyone else want to ask any other question?

Shri Mataji: (pointing to a gentleman) One man wants to ask a question

[Marathi]

If you speak in Marathi with Marathi people, they like it. Also, Marathi is a good language.

[Marathi]

A leader requests someone from the audience to come in front and then speak.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: You can write it down and tomorrow I will answer your queries.

[Marathi]

Mother is reading a question sent by audience.

Shri Mataji: Please remove your shoes. Now, don’t ask questions like, “Why is Mother asking us to remove our shoes?” This is because the Earth under our feet will benefit us. The Mother Earth answers and solves more than half of our problems. Poor Earth, I don’t know how many of our sins she is absorbing inside her already. Remove your shoes. Now you are sitting in front of your Mother. So now you don’t need to wear a cap or head gear. You don’t wear a hat in front of your mother. If it’s some prime minister, then the case is different. I am your mother. You don’t have to do any formalities with your mother. Human beings go simply in front of their mother. So please remove your caps as the process will have enlightenment of your fontanel bone area. So for this, remove your caps. So now I am telling you that in the left hand is your desires and on the right hand is your power of action, Karya Shakti. The entire process will involve these two hands. The power will blow through these two hands. So now keep your left hand in your lap.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Kindly listen. Please do remember this, that all the feelings we have about our self, that all the times we feel that, “I have done this wrongdoing, that wrongdoing in my life and I am a big sinner. I am very sad,” all these things you just drop them outside now. Just see that you are going to enter God’s Kingdom and for this you should be happy. The person who is not happy, how will he enter into the Kingdom of God? All those who cry all the time will be sent to jail. Only happy people can enter into God’s Kingdom. So please don’t be upset with yourself in any way. You yourself are the temple of God. You just have to enlighten it and awaken your spirit in it. Just this much has to be done. Your body is the temple. So now keep faith within yourself and close your eyes. Keep your left hand open and use your right hand.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Keep your left hand towards Me. You will have to keep your right hand over your different chakras out of which first is heart, and then over the upper abdomen, then on the lower abdomen. All will be on the left side of the body only.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Then move back from the lower abdomen to the upper abdomen, then on the heart and then on the neck. Hold it tightly here on the neck, and then on the forehead, then on the back side of the head, and lastly on the top of the head. The area is Bhramarandhra. Place your palm over the top of the head and move it seven times. This is how you do it. What to say as a prayer, at every step I will keep saying it. Listen to it carefully and do it very carefully.

Now do not observe others. Focus on yourself. Keep full faith and surrender towards yourself. Kindly close your eyes.

There is no-one here who cannot achieve his Self-realization.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Kindly close your eyes and do not open them because then your attention won’t rise. Everyone kindly keep your hand on your heart. Everyone keep your hand on your heart. Many of you who have heart problems will be benefited and the problem will vanish. Keep your hand on your heart and ask Me a question, “Mother, am I spirit?” This is the place for your spirit.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Do not open your eyes. Do not open your eyes at all. Please keep them shut.

Am I a spirit?

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Now slowly bring the same hand from the heart and place it on the upper abdomen, on the left side and press it. This is the chakra for the Guru. All the big saints and seers of the world, all the avatars of Shri Adi Guru, this is their place. So when you said that, “I am the spirit”. Now ask another question. These gurus have given you this blessing that you can be your own master. So, ask a question.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: At this place ask yourself a question, “If I am a spirit, am I my own master, too? Mother, am I my own master?”

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Now move this hand below, meaning towards the abdomen, and press it but only on the left side of the body in the lower part of your abdomen. Press your fingers.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Now you all should know that this chakra at the abdomen, this left side of Swadhisthan, creates all the works of the Divine. That is why its knowledge is called true knowledge. So now ask Me, “Mother, grant me true knowledge.”

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Mother, please give me true knowledge.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Say it six times. Grant me true knowledge. I respect your freedom. So you will have to ask for it. I cannot force it upon you. Now it will begin. Now the Kundalini awakening will start happening. So now we will open each chakra. Now you only are awakening your own Kundalini. Keep your left hands open towards Me and do not open your eyes. Now take this hand back you where you placed it earlier above on the upper part of abdomen, place it on the upper abdomen on the left-hand side on your Guru Tattwa.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Now at this chakra please say with full confidence. Till you speak, the chakra won’t open. Say, “Mother, I am my own guru.”

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: No one needs to perform any kind of showmanship here.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: At this time, keeping your right hand on the stomach on the upper side, say ten times, “Mother, I am my own guru.”

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Now put your right hand on your heart, and here with full faith you have to say, “Mother, I am a spirit.”

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: You have to assert yourself. You have to assert. Your will power has to be asserted.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Say it twelve times. This chakra has twelve petals.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: With full alertness.

Now this right hand, put it on your neck.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Place your hand where your shoulder meets your neck. I am using very easy language that is not at all difficult to understand. Hold it tightly. Hold your shoulder tightly, and all those people who think they are very guilty and think they are sinners and have made big mistakes and this is all very wrong to think. This kind of thinking attracts lot of diseases and for this you all say, “Mother, I am not guilty. I have not done anything wrong.” Say it 16 times, “I am not guilty.”

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: God, who is the ocean of mercy, forgives everything. You cannot do any big sin which he cannot forgive. Take your hand from the front.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Take your hand from the front and not from your back. Bring your hand from the front towards your left shoulder. This centre is catching too much. Do you all sit and just keep thinking about all the mistakes you have done? If this is what you all think, then say it 108 times, and this is your punishment.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Now bring this hand on your diagonal on the forehead and hold it.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Hold your forehead like we hold it when we have a headache. At this time you should say with your full heart, “Mother, I forgive everyone. Mother, I forgive everyone.” With full heart. A few will think, “I cannot forgive.” There is nothing you do. In this, whether you forgive or you don’t, it is all a play of words, but when you don’t forgive you get trapped in that problem, which other people have weighed you down with.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: None of you should think badly about yourself. Put your right hand on the back side. Hold it tight at the place where you have your optic lobe. Hold it tight. Now you have to just say, not thinking about any of your sins and not thinking of yourself as a sinner, “God, if I have committed any mistakes, please forgive me.”

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: put your hand on the head. Place your palm intact with your skin on your head, exactly in the centre. Press it and move it seven times and say, “Mother, I need my Self-realization. Please grant me,” as I cannot force this on you. So you have to ask for it and say, “Please grant me my Self-realization.”

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Put your attention on your head and say it.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Now place your right hand comfortably on your lap on the right side of your body, on your right knee. Do not open your eyes. Now, above your hand, nearly four fingers above, put your left hand and see if you can feel something cool.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: See if anything cool is coming out of your head. Your head will release coolness out of it, from your head.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: Place it a little above the head, 4 inches. You will feel the cool 4-5 inches above the head. Can you feel the coolness or not? Is it coming?

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: “Is this Ritambharapragya? Is this the Divine Power? Is this God’s All-pervading Divine Power?” Ask this question three times.

Bring your hands down. Now tell Me if you are feeling cool in your hands. Now open your eyes. Slowly open your eyes. Stay thoughtless and do not think. Open your hands and see if you can feel the cool breeze. Do not ……(unclear) this is very subtle.

[Marathi]

Shri Mataji: – All those people who could feel coolness in their hands or heads or anywhere, raise both hands. Mostly you all have felt it, and those who could not feel it today, they will feel it tomorrow, in full form. Not only this, those who felt it today, tomorrow their feelings on the hands will increase. So now you all are have exceeded. All the saints have crossed. My obeisance to all the saints.
