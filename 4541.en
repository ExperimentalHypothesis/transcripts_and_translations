Advice given on 15th February 1977 at New Delhi, on Sat-Chit-Anand in English.

Today I’m going to tell you, yesterday I told you what are the mental [ED.sounds like 'settas', 'stratas'?] or what is the totality of man. Whatever I have told you about it, about the totality of man, all his four sides, is: on top is the the super-consciousness, on the right-hand side is the supra-conscious state, and this side is the sub-conscious state, and down below is the hell. You can see that after Realization, not before. Before it, if I tell you that this man is not correct, that man is correct; you are not going to like it; you will think I am criticizing someone. Why should I criticize? One person I say he’s good, another person is not good. Later on, once you are Realized and you have gone deep into it, then you become so sensitive that even the name of such a person gives you a heat in the hand, you start burning, you don’t like it. So this strata, this strata of super-consciousness, I told you, I will be discussing today. Because yesterday we discussed it too, but now you might say that we must do even the collective subconscious and also this collective supra conscious, we should try to do everything. But you are sidetracked, not only, but you are affected, you are hurt. But the worst part of the whole thing is that after human state, if you go to any one of these states [?], you go to the pishacha. On the left-hand side you become a pishacha, and on the right-hand side you become a rakshasa.

Even after Realization a person like Ravana became a rakshasa. He was a Realized soul. He was a Brahmin, no doubt, he was; but even after that, you see, he had such a weakness for women. When he tried to do that, again he fell down, he became a rakshasa. The trouble is, after this stage, you become either a superman, or a what you call the devata or, you can say, the Realized Soul; or you become a rakshasa. So you have to choose. Now human state is such a state that either you go this way, that way, or you go to hell. And when you go to the extremes you come down to hell.

Supposing you have been to somebody who has been a tantrika [ED.black magician] and he has been trying all these things and all that; unknowing also; he does not know he’s a tantrika, and you have been to him, you come to Me, immediately we find out that there has been a problem. If you go to a Realized Soul, immediately I will know that he has been to….

Today one gentlemen came [from India[to Me?]]. I asked him: ‘Who is your Guru?’ And he told Me his name. He’s a Realized Soul, I know, in Kanchi, Shri Shankaracharya of Kanchi, the old one; he’s a Realized Soul; not the new one. The new one is not; none of them are, except for one, the Kanchi. When he told Me I said: ‘You will get your Realization, no problem; because you see, if he’s a Realized Soul, they will have no complications.’ He got his Realization, he was all right in no time. So no question. But if you go to, say, somebody else who is tantrika, bend your head before that, you can’t get your Realization.

Now, there is nothing to criticize. Why should I? I’m not a politician. I don’t want anything, I don’t want any money, nothing. I don’t have to know even about Kundalini. I know each and every thing about it, absolutely complete. I don’t have to have anything from you. Then why should I say that this man is not all right? Because I can, even a child can, say. If a child is Realized he would say.

My granddaughter she went in Ladakh to see some lama. She went to Ladakh and saw some lamas. These lamas are, none of them are Realized; surprisingly none of them are Realized; it’s a fact, I’m telling you. If they were Realized I would have said they are Realized, but if they are not I will say: ‘They are not.’ The pope is not a Realized person. This is not politics, this is absolute truth. So this little girl – she was hardly that time three or four years of age – so she looked at him and said: [HINDI OR MARATHI - SOUNDS LIKE: "Ekya sarumanai ki cho ga pinanke. Aise bandh ki baite. Garam('hot') kaige]. Immediately she said it because she could feel it; she’s a child.

We had once a program, and another granddaughter of mine she had come, and a big sadhu baba in Bombay, I will not name him, because you all know him. He’s not a Guruji but he’s running a big mission there. He was sitting on the dias and this my granddaughter was sitting with someone in front – she’s a small girl, very small; now she’s hardly five-and-a-half; that time she might be about four-and-a-half. She saw from there this gentlemen sitting there. They had called Me as a chief guest and he was the Chairman or something like that, so I don’t know, Chairman he was, something, I don’t know. She saw from there. She said: ‘Nanny nanny maxi pants garam garam (ED.’hot, hot’)(Marathi). It was so embarrassing (Marathi).

He’s telling you the truth; why do you call him obstinate? He’s a very brilliant boy, very brilliant. (Marathi) He’s so particular and one day he was saying that a (Marathi) he can’t bear it. One father came to see my brother, and my brother was about to touch his feet and he said: ‘If you would have touched his feet otherwise I would have hit the father very nicely. Why should you touch his feet?’

So, you see, the thing is, this is the absolute knowledge, it is the knowledge by which you know what is the truth, what is not the truth. [ED. SOMEONE ASKS A QUESTION] I know, that is the reason why I am so sorry. You see, why My attitude is very different from these Guru is: I don’t say that you spoil yourself: ‘Go to this one, go to this one; all right, die there’. I don’t say like that. I’m looking after you because I know you are seekers and I feel sorry because the seekers have done it, I feel very sorry.

Now the hippies abroad – you see My center is just in the center of the hippie village. Why? Because I know they are the seekers, poor things, they are suffering because they are the seekers. You see all My sympathies; all My heart goes to them because they are the seekers. You know how much I’m working with you, you know that very well, because I realize that you are a seeker and, in your ignorance, you have gone to these people.

Now you can say that: ‘Why didn’t God give us this sensitivity?’ God has, God has given you. Human beings were very sensitive at the time of Sitaji. At the time of Radhaji also they were very sensitive; but now, you see, the man, in his freedom, has become so materialistic. What impresses is a good dress, good features, big car, somebody coming in a big car. Oh big thing. We are becoming, day-by-day, very gross. This is the reason. And this grossness has grown into us, you see. That’s why you do not feel it. But there are many people, I tell you, who could not bear J. Krishnamurti. They said: ‘Oh he’s [seeking?]. What are we to get from him?’ It’s just simple, you see; use your brains. Either use your sensitivity of your heart or use your brain. God has given you brains. If you read J.Krishnamurti you’ll know he was seeking. It’s very easy to find out, the one who is seeking and the one who is not seeking.

Yesterday that singer was singing all the bhira[?] songs. Then he got Realized and I said: ‘Now don’t sing bhira; now you’ve got it.’ But still he goes on bhira, so God will say: ‘All right, let him not have his vibrations.’ So you lose his vibrations. In small things, you know, I’ve seen people lose their vibrations. Such a precious thing has been brought down to that, and for a small thing they lose it.

There was a man who got Realization and he went somewhere, Kashi or someplace. From there he bought some black thread, he was wearing. Now see the human mind, you say that we are, but this is stupidity. He gave that black thread to him. Now what is a black thread, you tell Me? What is the worth of a black thread? He lost his vibrations. When he came to Me I said: ‘My son, throw away this black thread.’ He cannot throw. He said: ‘No, no, no, no; I cannot throw black thread.’
I said: ‘Oh, what to do?’ I said: ‘Who has given you this black thread? Use your brain.’ I spent one hour discussing with him, then he threw the black thread. I said: ‘This man has taken, for this one small, little thing, five rupees from you; you must know this man is making money. His bad vibrations have gone; and why are you attached to it? Now do you know why he’s attached? Because he’s possessed by that. What is there in a black thread? You tell me? And he’s an educated man. He’s not a foolish man. That thread he could not throw. (Hindi) Now you know. (Hindi)

You see you are attached to these small, small things of life and not to the eternal things; that’s why, that’s why you lose it. I don’t ask you to sacrifice anything, I don’t even ask you to throw away anything. I don’t say that you give up anything there are people who smoke, drink – I don’t even say that, because I know , even if I say that, they will run away. I know that human being are like that. You see, I please you, I please, I chastise, I chide you, I do everything. But you must know one thing, that I want that you should stick onto reality. I will not allow you to have falsehood within you. There are methods that a Mother employs.

There was a great smoker, you see, who came to Me and he told me: ‘I cannot give up smoking; that’s why I cannot come to Sahaja yoga.’
I said: ‘No, no, you don’t give up smoking, you can come to Me; there is no need for you to give up Sahaja Yoga.’ He came, and you know what happened, a lot of smoke started coming from his nose and mouth, started getting the fragrance of udhbathi [ED 'incense']. He said: ‘What’s this happening?’
I said: ‘All your smoke is coming back.’ Now whenever he smoked he used to get that fragrance of udhbathi. He gave up. I played some tricks also to help him. But it’s for your good only.If it is for your hitha, for your kalyana[?], you should not do it.

There was a question people said that: ‘It is said that: “Say the truth and also it should pleasing, priyam”. How could you say ‘satya’ and ‘priyam’ together?’ Because if you say some satya people don’t like it; it is not priyaka. Because supposingI say: ‘You give up this habit of yours.’ Then you don’t like it. But that is a fact. If I say: ‘You don’t do this job; it is not a good job; you should not do it’. So you don’t like it. So what to do? So Krishna has found out; He says that: ‘You tell them the hita’. Hita means [?]. Whatever is hita for your atma must be told. So though it may not be priya, just now, after sometime, it becomes priya; because he realizes: ‘What I have got out of it’. Of course I don’t want to lose any one of you, I do not want you to lose your vibrations in anyway, never. How could I want it? I want you to have it. But you must know what your mind is up to.

Yesterday one gentleman was here; his Kundalini could not rise because he has had a some sort of an obsession. See the human mind how it works. Then he showed Me a photograph. I was telling: ‘I will not tell you’.
He was after My life. ‘You tell me what is this, what happened to me? I had become like this for three days; I went into trance, I had these things.’
I didn’t want to tell him, because I know it would upset him. So I gave it to one of these Sahaja yogis; they started burning their hands; they gave him back. Still he was after My life: ‘You must tell me, You must tell me?’
I tell him, I told him: ‘You were possessed.’ He was so angry with Me.
He was telling: ‘This is not Kundalini this can…’
You can see the Kundalini rising, you can see this reading of it, you can see the rising of it, you can see the acting of it, you can see the people who know about it, who know about collective consciousness. But he got angry with Me for that; he went away. Now what am I to do?
‘You see yourself in this. This is the (sounds like ‘tarpana’) I’m showing.’

There was another fellow who came; he was this Hatha yogi, he was a policewalla [ED. 'policeman'].
So I told him: ‘You have read Patanjali?’

He said: ‘Yes.’

I said: ‘In Patanjali it is said that it is not meant for householders; it is meant for Sanyasis who are sitting in the jungles with the Guru. It’s yama-niyama[?], brahmacharya and everything.

He said: ‘Yes, it’s true, there are eight things to be done.’

I said: ‘Are you doing eight things?’

He said: ‘No.’

Shri Mataji: ‘What is your relationship with your wife?’

Yogi: ‘She’s run away.’

Shri Mataji: ‘Then?’

Yogi: ‘I’ve become very hot-tempered; even my Guru is a big, hot-tempered man.’

Shri Mataji: ‘Now you are teaching this to police people? God save us!’
Oh God! They will have no heart left because if you do Hatha yoga the heart becomes just like this.

You have seen Durvasa, that horrible fellow Vishwamitra; you want to become that? They had no love for anyone. I have seen all these… I must say, these Hatha yogis. I wish they married, all of them. Those who are sitting in the jungle, who are Realized souls, see, they have no heart, they have no feeling. I’ve told you what is their feeling [opinion?]. They have no karuna [ED.'compassion'] within themselves. They just say: ‘You are a Mother, so You have the karuna.’ But what about all the great saints? They had karuna; they were married people. All the Hatha yogis, if you find anybody who’s doing Hatha yoga, whether wife or a husband, they can never live with kids [?], because all the chakras are spoiled; no brahmacharya is there. [Hindi]

[Yogi asks question (inaudible)]

Shri Mataji: ‘Why don’t you… you have some problem of Kundalini or what? Doubts.’
Yogi: ‘I have some doubts….’

Shri Mataji: ‘Doubts – first of all, did you get your Realization?’

Yogi: ‘I was doing something; I would like to talk to you about it.’
Shri Mataji: ‘You have been doing something? (Hindi)’

Yogi: ‘I have given it up.’

Shri Mataji: ‘Don’t you worry; we’ll see now supposing… You see what I’m saying. All right, so it’s a good thing. You just sit down just now, we’ll see. If you get your Realization, well and good. No problem, forget it. If you do not get, supposing there is a problem in you, already existing, they will immediately know on your chakras. (Hindi)

You see the Kundalini comes up and falls down. So what am I to do now? (Hindi) Everybody can understand Hindi? Ah, can’t follow?’

Yogi: (inaudible)

Shri Mataji: ‘That would be too much. If I say in English will you all follow?’

Yes.(Hindi) You have never bothered about the Spirit, you see; so we have to use some common language. We speak about Atma – English language is not sufficient enough. I must tell you, they do not have those experiences because this is so far they have not gone deep into it, and we are very old people, ancient people. Our culture has been to know God, and everything has come in Sanskrit because Sanskrit is really a devavani [ED. 'language of the gods']. Apart from that, when the Kundalini moves, She makes sounds, She makes different sounds, which we – they are really devanagari sounds, all of them are, on all different chakras they are. If I have time I might tell you all those sounds that It makes.

So our Sanskrit is really a devavani, and even when you say mantras then, through the Sanskrit language or devanagari pronunciations only, you can excite them better. Try to learn if not Sanskrit at least Hindi, because it is more, sort of, a simpler language and, its being a phonetic language, you see, it has a sound and that sound gives that vibratory effect. You try to learn it. Hindi is not My mother tongue; My mother tongue is Marathi. I speak Hindi because, after all, I know the importance of it. Also know a little bit of English and I speak in English also. So it is better to know at least Hindi. It’s not much when we can know a foreign language. We can know our own one national language; there’s no harm in it. I mean this, I do not want to make it a political stuff but what I’m saying is that, for conveying our…Marathi is all right for Me, Bangala is all right; I don’t know much of Tamil or Telugu but Telugu also, Tamil also, you can, because, you see, we are people in this yoga bhoomi. This is a yoga bhoomi. This is a great country of yoga. You don’t know, every particle of this bhoomi, you will be surprised, is vibrated. You see, these scientists, and all that, cannot understand.

When we start accepting all that the West is saying, we are going to lose all that we had, which is so great. Of course, that it is not going to be lost, But, the thing is, they are not going to utilize it for our purpose. We have to close all that on one side and we’ll have to accept something, which is just a foreign, alien thing, and nothing so much comprehensive. You can say: ‘It is not suma [samath?]‘, it doesn’t envelope everything.

So English language is all right – I can speak and I can talk to you and explain.- but I would request you that little bit of Hindi language if you learn, it’s a good thing, because I find it very difficult. You know, there’s one speech of Mine they have written in English and that was translated in Marathi, and what a tremendous thing it was, and in English I think it’s a poor show, absolute poor show. Maybe My English is very poor, maybe that; I don’t know, but maybe that.

So we were talking about Sat Chit Ananda – again I have to use Sanskrit words; see now, what can I do? Sat Chit Ananda is the super consciousness, the All-pervading power. Chit is attention, the consciousness, conscious; you are just now conscious listening to Me; every moment you are conscious, but every moment is becoming dead into the past, every moment coming from the future to the present. But you are conscious at this moment, listening to me. A thought rises like this and falls; you can see the rising of the thought but not the falling of the thought. In between the thoughts, there is a space which, in Sanskrit, we call as vilambar; of course in English there isn’t, because they haven’t found it out. So there is a vilambar and in that vilambar if you can stop, then you get to the conscious mind, and there exists this Sat Chit Ananda. Sat Chit Ananda is the condition of mind, you can say, or is the state of mind where there is no thought, but you are aware. First: there is no thought – Nirvichar – but you are aware. That is the first state, where you jump into it, into the super-conscious.

So some people may think that, by Realization, you must achieve something as Adi Shankaracharya had; it’s not possible With some it may be; with very few, but not with everyone. First state is Nirvichar: you become thoughtlessly aware: that’s just the first state. That happens when the Kundalini rises above the Agnya Chakra; means enters into the limbic area. At that time your attention just touches the Sat point, the Sat [true, being present], the reality separate from mithya [untruth thing] ; you are separate. You become two personalities.

At that stage, you start separating. Like in the milk, when you put yogurt, or, you can say, if you put lime; it starts separating into water and the curd. In the same way the beginning starts, the beginning. This is the state where you can say the Kundalini has been awakened only. You must understand the different stages as it happens. I’m giving you a very slow picture. But normally the Kundalini shoots off in most of the people. But in some people It does not, it takes time. It’s lost in the Swadhistana, It is lost into the Nabhi, It doesn’t go much higher. It is arrested by the [de?] Chakra or maybe it may not even rise at all. But in case It crosses this door of Agnya Chakra, then you get into the state of thoughtless awareness. With thoughtless awareness, as like whatever state you get – supposing, you become a governor, so you get  a certain power; with that you get certain powers. But, at this state, to leave the Kundalini is not a good thing, because the Kundalini can, at that state, start moving this side and that side, can, it’s possible, can go to the Supra conscious, or can go to the Subconscious, Collective Subconscious. The siddhis, people get mostly at this stage. Some of the - not the shudra siddhis but the higher siddhis like, you see, they can predict. They can say: “This is going to happen,” if the Kundalini has moved to the Supra conscious. If the Kundalini has moved to the Collective Subconscious, then they can start seeing things. You see, a person who is like that, he comes to Me, he can see who I was in My previous lives. I do not have to convince them. This is the same thing as anybody who is possessed get.

A person who takes drugs, supposing he is a real alcoholic of the last work and he’s a good soul, he is still seeking God; such a person can see Me in a different form. He can see My past, he can be very much enamored by Me, he would know that I was…Because, you see, people think the past is better than the present only, because the past has been much greater than today. Though I’ve never given Realization to anyone previously, but it was a great past because human beings are like that. So he gets enamored when he sees things like that. This happens with people who are on the supra-conscious level, if they move on. If they move out – I’m sorry, if this happens to people if they move out onto the left-hand side, that is, into the past. Those who move out on the right-hand side can see Me as light, they see light. They see all the five elements: they can see Me as a waterfall or as an iceberg. They start seeing the tanmatra – again it’s a Sanskrit word, means the casual, you can say, the ‘causal essence’, causal essence of the element. It may help them to get convinced. Because such a person gets convinced about Me, no doubt. Such a person is much more convinced than you are.

Now, there are so many tantrikas who know who I was, they are afraid of Me, they talk about Me, they tell about Me. There was an ordinary maidservant, who came to My program, and she got into this. She started speaking Sanskrit and she described Me completely, fifteen slokas itself. First time I never said anything about Myself; that’s how it started.

52:40

So at that state I would not like to leave your Kundalini. Because you can cure people, curative can be done with your Kundalini, even in the limbic area. I’m very anxious always that it should come out of the Brahmarandhra. At that state you start getting the vibrations. But at this stage you are just a chitta only, and you just touch Sat point. Your attention is only charmed by the Spirit, only the attention part. Spirit, as I told you, is like a flicker of light, in a gas lamp, and Kundalini is like a gas which touches the Spirit. And the light of the Spirit spreads in the central nervous system. But only the Chitta part; the outer core is the Chitta, means the attention part. At that stage when the Kundalini opens the Brahmarandhra, at that time what you feel is the vibrations from your hand, and you can feel another person also. Because you become collectively conscious. Collectively conscious only, again out of the Sat Chit Ananda, you just touch the Chitta part. So you start feeling the Chitta of your Chitta becoming the Chitta of the collective consciousness. Means you drop into the ocean of Sat Chit Ananda in which you only feel the collective consciousness. That means you can feel another person’s Kundalini.

Yesterday there was another gentleman, as you have seen it, he was arguing with Me that we have ‘suspended intelligence’ and all that.

I said: ‘What is this “suspended” ?’ I don’t know about this thing. So I told him.

He said: ‘I am in a turyadasha ‘.

I said: ‘If you are in turya you can feel the Kundalini of another person. [Laught]. You cannot certify yourself like that. Can you feel the Kundalini of another person?’

He said: ‘No.’

Then I said: ‘How can you be in the turya? If you go into turya that means, if you cross this stage, then you have to feel the Kundalini of another person.’ Now you have seen there are many who can feel it and they all say the same thing, the same language, whether they are English, Indians or anything. They say the same thing, that this chakra, this chakra is catching, that chakra is catching; it is not so.  Because you start seeing your Kundalini. You start seeing the Kundalini of others. Because on the fingers you can feel it. You can feel it on the fingers, what is happening.

So you just feel the Chitta, not the Ananda part. First stage is only Chitta: that you feel the Kundalini of another person, you can raise the Kundalini of another person, you can give Realization also, after a little while, to another person. Of course My photograph has to be used -but still you can. But the Ananda stage is not yet touched.

So in the beginning you just feel the cool breeze in the hand, you feel the peace, tranquility also; there’s no thought, you feel the thoughtless awareness. But the Ananda part is not felt at the first outset. Because now I have studied thousands of human beings and I have seen their problems, and this is a fact. But there are some, as I’ve told you, who reach the last stage, very few; very, very few. But among us we have here one or two persons whom – you can say – who have reached that stage also. They are not aware of it, perhaps, but Ananda they can feel it.

So the first stage when you come, it is the Chitta stage, the consciousness stage; you touch the sat, means you start seeing the reality. Is one thing that you are flowing, there’s something flowing; then you start saying: ‘It’s going, it’s coming.’ Just now you said: ‘It’s coming.’ You didn’t say: ‘I am receiving, I am giving.’ That ‘I’ goes out of your language. But still the ego and superego are not completely gone down, they are still there. But your attention has come up and you feel the Chitta.

With this collective consciousness you can cure people, you can give them Realization, as I told you. And also you can feel the Kundalini of any person in the whole world. And also you can cure the Kundalini of that person. I mean cure, not the Kundalini, but I’m saying cure the chakras or improve the chakras of the other person; sitting down here, you can do it. You can tell about the condition of the Kundalini of another person, sitting down here. If you take interest, wherever you attention goes it works, Chitta. So your attention becomes universal. Your drop of your attention becomes one with the ocean of Sat Chit Ananda. Out of that, the attention part only. Listen to Me for this very carefully because many people at this stage drop out. Only the attention becomes effective, wherever they put attention, sitting down here.

Now I’ll tell you about a disciple of Mine who had come from England. One day he was sitting and was thinking about his father, suddenly he got a burning on his finger, this finger. So he rang up his father.

He said: ‘How are you keeping?’

So the mother said that: ‘He is very sick, he has got throat trouble.’
This boy did something to his finger and all that; the father got all right. You can do it. Now he might think, he is very powerful; he does not, he cannot think that way, he cannot think. Because, you see, because the hole has been made there.
So he just says: ‘Mother, I felt it and I did like this and he was all right.’ He never says that: ‘I cured.’ ‘I’ goes out in the language, in the words that you use you don’t say: ‘I did it.’
He said: ‘It came, it went, it did, it’s not coming out.’
He’ll say, even then he’ll also say this:
‘Mother, today my Agnya is catching. Mother, my heart is catching.’ They come and say like this about themselves. Now I say: ‘this Agnya is catching’ means is a little maddening? But one doesn’t feel bad about it. Because he’s not attached to his Kundalini. He’s attached to his – I mean – to his chakras but to his atma. So he says as an atma.
He says: ‘Oh my this chakra is caught, that chakra is caught.’

A person now who is suffering, say, from cancer, doesn’t know he is suffering from cancer. But a Realized person who gets his Realization, his attention will tell him that these chakras are out of gear, and so many chakras out of gear means – cancer. He need not go to the doctor; he can diagnose himself. But he will not diagnose the way the doctors do, that: ‘You have got the cancer of the heart and cancer of this thing and cancer of that’. But he will say: ‘It is these chakras are caught up, the left or the right. Now from where it is coming, how far it is going, he can give the depth of the chakras. Because the chakras start from here to here, and this is the void, so the depth of the chakras he can tell you: ‘It is from here, she’s catching from here, she’s catching from there, she’s catching from there’’.

But there are many abstract things that happen; this is a very important thing. Once you get your Realization the chiranjivas [ED. 'immortals'] surrender. They are watching you, you become their responsibility. All the deities are awakened within you; if you do anything against the deities, immediately they will give you a heat. A person who has got Realization, if he goes in a place which is not to be seen or which is not to be felt, which is not a good place, or a Guru or somebody like that; immediately he will feel heated up. If he doesn’t run away, if he still goes on and on and on, he’ll lose his vibrations, and he’ll become just like the other person.

So it’s a very transitory stage still, I would say, because still, at this point, the repulsion is not so great that the man does not accept it. Because if you accept it, you become just like that. If you do not accept it that maybe little bodily problem you might have: you might little bit burn your fingers, you might get little burning here or something like that. But if you are not afraid of these bodily things, and if you do not want to accept it, then you start rising higher. But, as I told you, all the chiranjivas start rising, looking after you.

If there is one Realized person in a train, there cannot be an accident; and if there is an accident nobody will die in that train. If a Realized soul…

Yogi: They can get wounded.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Yogi: They can get wounded.

Shri Mataji: Ah, wounded – can be – but see, we remember we have seen of one incident where it happened; they were so slightly wounded that they didn’t take them to the hospital, anyway one of them. I mean, a little frightened they might have been; but that’s what they told Me. There was one Realized soul who was traveling by train which collided near Thane or someplace. Then the…. If a Realized soul, a soul is walking on the road – now, Realized soul who is in Nirvichara state; see, we have to grade them – walking on the road and if he sees a mishap, his attention goes there, immediately the mishap is avoided.

Yogini; ?….

Shri Mataji: Yes; if he sees a mishap, then it is averted – attention- you see, his attention is being blessed. Now see, this is what a scientist cannot understand.

Yogi: (inaudible)

Shri Mataji: No, no, no; the internal Gods are his own part and parcel, as you can say: ‘I am guided by my brain so I can’t do anything else’. You see, Gods are your internal parts yourself. What is self left there? What is your self?

When you are united with that, then you are finished now, you become a hollow personality. Then you do not have this feeling of self. Then all the time what you say: ‘It is happening, it is going, it is flowing, it is working – “it”.’ You can even say like this; this little girl says ‘Pragya’; she says:
‘This little Pragya won’t go; she is very obstinate. Just now her agnya is caught so she won’t go’.

She stands outside from herself and she criticizes herself. She says: ‘Her agnya is caught; she won’t go, she is very obstinate’; she’s not Pragya. Even children say like that, many a times – if you notice, like a third person. You start looking at yourself as a third person. You do not identify yourself with yourself. It happens like that, you will see these people how they are working.

Then also there is a part of little enjoyment, which you must know, the joy, Ananda. You see, normally you will find most of the Sahaja yogis will gather around a person who is a Realized soul, who is Realized, who is not a difficult person. Moreover if there is somebody who comes on My Foot, who is a very great soul.

I’ll tell you, in Calcutta I went there, and I was staying in a hotel, and there was a very nice man who came to see Me. He was not Realized but a very saintly person with a great Purva Sampada, you see. and he just touched My Feet, and other Sahaja yogis in other rooms they all rushed there!

I said: ‘Why did you come?’ He said: ‘Great joy started coming within us so we came.’ And they were standing- he was all the time on My Foot and they were standing. I said: ‘Neither is he going to leave Me nor you are going to leave me; for fifteen minutes he was just drinking the nectar of my feet. So the 'Joy' of enjoying another Human beings joy also starts.

&nbsp;

These are the feelings this is how you enjoy 'Nirvichar or Samadhi' Samadhi does not mean going into unconscious but the unconscious becomes conscious. Whatever is not yet conscious becomes conscious. The unconscious, the Universal Unconscious becomes conscious.  So this is the first stage.  There are many things like this and variety of things happen.’

&nbsp;

Supposing you have been doing lot of, see, light Puja, what you call the Jyoti Puja, in your previous life, then you can see the chakras, My-this thing, vibrations, There are two, three people who can see My vibrations coming and going; they see all the movement of it. Supposing you have been doing Devi puja, so you are a Devi pujari, you are a Sampada of the [?] Devi; then you see something of  'Devi Praman', a little bit, you can see that also.

That is a better thing than to see before. Because if you see before Realization, means you are a possessed person; somebody is giving you ideas.  After realization you start seeing certain things, then it has some meaning.  So the gradual growth of the flower starts.

Then the second stage, where you become Nirvikalpa, where there is no vikalpa [doubt]. Just now in Delhi there are very few who are like that, very few. Because, first of all, by temperament they are vikalpi [ED. 'doubters']. The reason is, here is a complete atmosphere of vikalpa. If you say something another one will pull you down by saying something else. So, the thing is, the whole atmosphere is so vikalpi that you are not yet subtle about it, about the Sahaja Yoga, still in vikalpa. But we have some very great Sahaja yogis also in Delhi, very great. So the vikalpa is there; now you will say: ‘How do you become Nirvikalpa?’ Supposing you are in the water, you are afraid of getting drowned; you are picked up and put in the boat. So you are not afraid of becoming drowned. But when are you settled? When you are settled. I mean, it is suggesting that: ‘When are you settled in a boat? When you are settled in a boat.’ – I mean, that’s all I can answer you – you have to be settled. But, with that, you get certain powers: your Kundalini starts showing, you see. We have, in Bombay, some people whose Kundalini is at least one foot higher, one foot high, you can see. You can – or may not – but so many people can see that, and they are a very deep people, very deep.

At the Nirvikalpa state the Collective Consciousness becomes very subtler, subtler, subtler. At that stage you can understand very deep significances of things, and the reality starts becoming clearer. For example: you start understanding the working of the Kundalini, You start understanding how it penetrates, you start understanding how it works out, you can use it for experimentation; with your own hand you can move it as you like it. You can cure people and you can show the Kundalini is working in different ways. You can combine the permutations and combinations of Kundalini, you can do.

You can say, that in the first year of music, you just learn the seven notes and two others notes; just an ordinary raga. But when you grow subtler and higher, then you know all the minute points, how to create. So at the Nirvikalpa you need not put your hand towards a person, nothing; sitting down you know where it is. What is happening? Who is catching? What is the problem? What is the collective problem? Then you have no doubts about Sahaja Yoga, nor about Kundalini, nor about anything; no doubts at all. But at that time, you start experimenting with it, you start using it, mastery starts. At this stage the Chitta, the consciousness, becomes subtle.

Now, somebody was sitting with Me; outside they knew that this gentlemen is going to get Realization, they knew that Mother was giving Realization to someone. Such people are very satisfied; they do not grudge and grumble about small things. They do not enter into small things at all, they are not bothered, they live in a big way. They are not touched. Their attention is not in the gross, they have no time for outside grossness. So their attention is very deep into the subtle forms; they are not bothered. Such people are satisfied souls. Such people are the ones who are going to create a pillar for Sahaja Yoga. Because when somebody sees such a person, a transformed person like that- shocked, they say: ‘Look at this man. He’s such a great person, and he was such a horrid man, and how has he become like this? How he’s transformed.’ At this stage, at the Nirvikalpa stage, the vibrations emit. Then you can sit with Me here, you start. Then there is no questioning at all. And such a man can get into a terrible temper if he sees someone misbehaving with Me; he can’t bear misbehaving.
Christ said: ‘Forgive all those, because they do not know what they are doing.’ But supposing they had done anything against His Mother, He would not have forgiven even this much, I can tell you, even this much. And in the Bible it is written that: ‘Nothing will be tolerated against the Holy Ghost.’ And Holy Ghost is His own Mother, the Adi Shakti.

&nbsp;

End of tape1- 1;13;30 minutes

&nbsp;

Hence you cannot tolerate anything against your Mother or Sahaj yoga and one can get into a tremendous temper or a "Sanhar shakti" which they develop.  It is said that such a man if anybody tries to do some harm he will immediately bring him down through their devotion towards their Mother.  We have a notion that a realized person should never lose his temper.  It is a very wrong idea.  Then you will say, "why Krishna killed Jarasandha, why did he kill Kansa ?" How do you explain the violence of Krishna ? How do you explain Devi who killed demons when She came and got into Her Temper ? She used to get into tremendous temper and then she used to kill.  The temper of Shiva ! How do you explain this ?

It is a foolish idea to say that they should not get into the temper even if someone tries to kill them.  Even Christ had to take the whip () in his hand and drive them away.  You have a right to get into a temper, if you are in a Nirvikalpa state since you are given that right of even raising one's own voice when need arises.  I am using all the -Ayudhas, if you have noticed in my hand, the Chakra, the Parasha etc.  They are there and I have to use them and you cannot stop me from using them.  This is what I say that by reading people don't understand things.  A man who is quietly sitting and is being pestered by every body is called a realized person-what nonsense 1 How dare you spite at such a man ? Is the spite of a Devi to be borne by a realized soul ? To say that a realized soul should not get into a temper is a wrong thing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now all those Rishis I have talked about and all those people who have talked about me and whose names I have given you, they are all above Nirvikalpa, but they are very hot tempered.  These saints cannot tolerate hypocrisy but I can' and I have to.  No 'Rakshas' can go near them but if anybody goes they are put into a noose and are hanged on the tree.  That's why I say never go near the 'Babaji'.  They are higher people, no doubt, better than you all are and they know me very well and they fall at my feet.  They are very innocent and simple like children to me.  More important is Shri Ganesha.  If he gets angry it is not so easy to control him.  It is easier to control Shri Shiva's but not Ganesh's anger.  Beware of him.  That is why during Kundalini Awakening, you get burning sensation and you start dancing or jumping, all this is Ganesha's anger.  If you have insulted him by any chance, or insulted his Mother, He gets into a tremendous fury.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It is true that after Nirvikalpa, the Ganesha becomes really Jagrut.  Such a person is not tempted by any women.  No temptation for another women will exist, except for his own wife, where he goes on living like a celebrated husband, because husband and wife are united in a bond of matrimony.  Otherwise, he is a sanctified householder.  He does not have temptation for-any alcohol or anything like smoking and is beyond temptation.  A Nirvikalpa man cannot have any temptation.  One man came to me and told me that he was a realized Soul.  I said, "how can it be ?  If you are a realized Soul, how are you taking to these things ? You cannot".  Now for me, I will tell you it is an impossibility.  I have never taken anything.

Once my doctor gave me a little brandy as a medicine.  I don't know why but he felt like giving it to me without informing me, due to which I vomited so much of blood since my stomach is religious or sacred If I see a woman who has dressed provocatively or something like that or sometimes I have to accompany my husband to parties and they start a cabaret or some such thing.

Immediately, I start getting vomiting, sensation like hell and more so when we are the chief guests.  I make their lives miserable, since something happens in my stomach when I see these half-dressed women.  Now what can I do with my stomach is the point because the Dharma is born within our stomach.  So the stomach becomes the Dharma itself.  At this stage the subtle style of things starts.

Your Mooladhar becomes chastity itself.  It just cannot bear these things.  You don't have to tell them.  They have just no interest in such women.  They do not flirt nor have they any interest in all these things.  They do not bother too much to dress up in such a way that they would be very attractive to other women or men and at that time they believe like very simple people.  They get to simplicity dignified, Then suddenly they become very creative also.

&nbsp;

There is one gentleman in Bombay who got into 'Nirvikalpa' State.  He came to me when he was jobless.  So I told him "why don't you start interior decoration work ?" He said that he did not know different types of wood nor could differentiate between one type and another so what could he do ? I said, "now, you are in Nirvikalpa so start it".  Today he is a very rich man.

It just becomes dynamic, because you start seeing the beauty, the 'Saundarya' of the nature.  You see-aesthetics are born in a person who is a realized Soul.  He starts seeing aesthetics in everything.  The beauty of talking improves.  The movements of the hands improve and your style also improves.  You become a beautiful person aesthetics come in.  You can become suddenly a great poet.  We have two people like that who have written beautiful poems and you can also be a great painter if you a already a painter.  You get new ideas about painting, new aesthetics.  In music, you start understanding absolutely.  You may not know what classical music is but you will start understanding the subtle music.  From the classical music you will know which is the best for your Atma.  You see the atma starts judging everything on that level.  If you appoint such a person to judge a drama or a painting, whether it is good or bad, he will correctly judge it good or bad.  Then you put his selection to all the critics of the world and they will say it is the best judgment Now, you will ask me "how does he know?" Because he can feel by vibrations and complete harmony in everything.

&nbsp;

You give him a Statue of a deity and ask him all about this statue whether it is alright or not.  He might say that it is not alright .

&nbsp;

You can feel the subtle vibrations, whether it is in Dharma or otherwise.  Now can we say say that Ashlavinayaka's are living Gods.  How do you know ? Jyotirlingas are living.  How will you know ? Unless you know the integration of all the great souls together and how are you going to judge them ?  That is why you must get Realization.  This is what my father told me.  I should say he was my first Guru, as he was a realized soul.  He told me it is of no use talking about realities etc., because you will create another Bible or Gita.  You do a practical thing.  You find out 'A-mass-media' and I knew that was my mission So I worked on everybody's Kundalini and tried to find out permutations, combinations, of their mistakes and why these people are like this.  You will be surprised that so many-people never knew that they were even in Nirvichara.  They did not know that they were highly placed spirits.  If they would have known, then they would not have told many things which have conditioned you.  They have said, "Sach Bolo".  Who is going to speak 'truth'?  They did not know what Human beings are ?  They are 'Incarnations'-a great people.  They did not know much about the Human beings and how cunning they are or how they are all the time against each other.  They could not come to the subtle human level.  For that one has to have a Human self-realization, as I now have.  As such I know human beings but some things, of course, I do not understand.

&nbsp;

When you get into the Nirvikalpa state, the Ananda starts settling in you.  When you see cities, any beautiful picture or scene , immediately what you find is a great flow of Ananda Coming down.  This is the Grace that you are just lost into it; like the Ganges flowing over you, you are completely drowned into it.  Your consciousness becomes Anand.

In reality you come to know that till now we have never known there is a Sarvavyapi Shakti' but now we are aware of the same.  We can feel it coming in our fingers.  This is the Reality.  There is Chaitanya all around us, which thinks, which understands, organizes and loves us.  All this you come to know the knowledge part of it.  Then the Anand which is the Hridaya starts emitting it.  Later on what you get is Vilaya into Ananda.  At that stage complete Self realisation takes place.  At that stage you can control the sun, you can control the moon, you can control every element.

&nbsp;

Beyond that there is God's Realization.  There are three stages to that also, but just now I have told about this.  'Sat-Chit-Anand' state.  The 'God's Realization' is the stage which, Gautam Budha and Mahavira only had achieved and settled down in our brain, Christ is also here.  These two are not incarnations.  They are born as Human beings.

They were born to Sita, as Lava and Kusha. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahavira and Adishakti' was their Mother once again.  Later on they were born to 'Fatimabi' as Hasan and Husain.  They are the two milestones you have got, by which you can know to what height a Human being can rise.

&nbsp;

Now today they are like incarnations.  There are other styles of personalities like Chiranjivas, Bhairava, Ganesha.  There are all incarnations.  Hanumana later on appeared as 'Gabriel the Angel'.  'Bhairavnath' came as Saint Michael.  The names are different, but they are the same personalities.  Devi has also incarnated.  There is no doubt about it.  The scientist will not understand this but a Sahaja Yogi can.  Because they can immediately feel their vibrations and can ask questions.

You can ask questions about me also and you will get the vibrations.  For that at least your Deities have to rise and say 'Yes'.  You may or you may not get 'Realization' but the answer you will definitely get.

May God bless you.
