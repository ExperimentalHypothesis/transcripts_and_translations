Welcome Talk at India Tour, Alibag (India) 13 December 1987.

Welcome to all of you. This is a great country, it is also passing through a crisis. Nowadays I feel there are so many things that are happening which you could never dream before and at this time you all have arrived bringing peace and joy to all of them. So I thank you for that.

The strife and the pain which is on human beings is perhaps because they are not yet worthy of God's blessings, still as God has created them He tries to do His utmost to see that human beings are kept comfortably all right on this Mother Earth. He creates all kinds of beautiful things that you see and the whole cosmos is in unison and working out something very great today. This new revolution that has started, very, very silently, today it is taking its shape and is providing a new future for all of us. You see those big, big trees, that are on top of your head and as long as you are sitting here no fruit will fall upon you. It's not because I am here but because this Mother Earth knows that there are such great saints sitting here and She is not going to disturb.

This place was called as Shrigaav [gaav means village - SG] I was told, means the village of the Goddess and this fruit is called as Shriphal [phal means fruit - SG] meaning the fruit of the Goddess. But actually if you see a coconut it is something like our Sahastrara and it's very auspicious because it can absorb lot of vibrations, as if it has got its realization. As you people can absorb My vibrations, this fruit can absorb also My vibrations, in the greatest amount. So we are here today in a very big way to advertise the coming of the New Age. The coming of the Golden era people have talked about. Here we are to say what is reality, what is truth, what is joy. Here we are to manifest that and also to create a commotion or a movement in the cosmos so that this new awareness is established in the cosmos which will enlighten this country and the people of this country. Also you will pick up the threads of this movement within yourself which is a very subtle movement going on.

At this moment we are in a strife of an intellectual who tried to describe Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, in a slurry manner. And this is the time I want to bring your attention that if this intellectual strife, you use them intelligence to bring down all the ideals which enlighten our path, which gives us the guidelines and an aspiration then our life become absolutely mundane, useless, joyless. It's very easy to condemn an ideal life but to attain that life is very difficult. And some people because they cannot attain it, try to condemn it so that they feel that they are no less, no way less than those great lives. All these ideals are created, these images are created, everywhere in the world by divine power and people look at them and think that these great lives are beautiful, though they have suffered a lot but they are so much of deeper understanding and deeper balancing and a deeper love. These ideals are very important for human societies otherwise they will be absolutely living in a relatively and they will have no absolute major to find out what is right and what is wrong.

In Sahaja Yoga we are here first of all to get connected with God Almighty, with His power, the All-Pervading Power of Chaitanya. By that we become our own master, in the sense that we get our own guidelines. If some Sahaja Yogi has not achieved that much then it is a serious thing. At least a Sahaja Yogi should be able to see at the minimum of minimum what is wrong with that person. To cleanse yourself and to put yourself right, is of course is a very important duty of every Sahaja Yogi. But these things are not to be taken as condemnation of yourself by any chance. And you should not be identified with those problems that you have but try to face them and cure them.

Many a times I have heard Sahaja Yogis saying that Indians are very simple people they are not complicated Mother so they can achieve their ascent much faster. But it's not that it is very different for all of you, very much. And despite all the complications, and all kinds of brain washing, and all kinds of book reading and all kinds of so-called seeking, and all that non-sense one has gone through, you have come out, you have washed yourself completely and today you are there united together to face all that is absurd, all that is false, all that is wrong. It has to be a very formidable army for us because you should see around, even in this country, you call it not complicated, there are many who are all the time to complicate others and to destroy all their ideals, destroy all their visions and brain wash them. So you have to be very alert your ascent and you have to be very conscious, that it is you who is going to build up this great image of ideal people, not one ideal life but ideal people in all [characters ?].

Now on your way to our tour, you are now on the threshold of entering into a new dimension, it is a subtler dimension and this subtler dimension is within ourselves. And there lies your own being as your Spirit. It sees you as separate, yourself is separate from inside. All these identifications have to be dropped out, all kinds of misidentifications, I was reading one of the marriages list and all that, somebody says that they will marry Indians, some say, "We'll not marry Indians", some say, "We will not change the countries", some say they will change the country". Even after Sahaja Yoga if we stick on to one country as our own then I must say that we have to give up those limitations. The time has come, of course, you have a choice. Nobody is going to force you to do anything but it also expresses your personality that you still are lingering on to these small, small limitations.

As I have told you many a times God created only one world, of course, He created varieties, just to create beauty but how blind we are that we think we are different people, we are of different countries, of different races, of different castes, communities, cities then little, little rows of houses. I would say you become from human being to rats and rats to worms and then I don't know what is the situation later. Let's open our hearts, let's become great, we have to be like lights, not to be small and creepy people like worms. There are many worms everywhere in the world. We are specially chosen people to be something great. So open your heart. That's the main problem. This ego covers the heart and makes you feel that, "Now I am an Indian, I am a Christian, I am this thing, I am that."

Now if I say someone you are not to go to temple then I must be a very cruel person to say that not to go to a temple. But they go to a temple and come back with such a big entity on their heads. Then they go to churches, the other day I had a bad experience of a lady who went to a church in France and she has become something like a minister, may be something like a pope. I mean something very funny, you know, nothing normal. I couldn't discover it when I asked she said, "I went to a church."

"Why?"

"Because they arranged a marriage there."

"Why?"

"Oh, they wanted to have a big social event so they wanted to have our marriage."

But you could just a registered marriage and finish it off. Why do you want to go to a church, where all dead bodies are buried there, to get back some of them on your heads?

So we have to be prepared to give up all the shackles of nonsense from our heads, all kinds of things there are, so much of conditionings, come down even to the color scheme, then it's all conditioning. This is too much, not good, all funny, funny ideas and anything funny and nonsensical that comes up, such funny brains, fix it up. The other day I was telling a lady about her food that a new idea has come that you should not eat any salt and sugar, I mean just imagine! Salt is so important for our breathing. If you ask a doctor, I don't know what is happening to the doctors and sugar is so important for our combustion. But anybody says anything you people just jump at it and you people just try to be, impress by all these ideas and start torturing yourself.

Last but not the least I feel now, I have seen the program on Gnostics, Gnostic G N O. I was thinking it comes from where G N O. In Sanskrit language gyna, gyna we call it, we call it gyna or gya, anyway, that means to know. Gnostics means the one who knew. When St. Thomas came to India, He came via boat and He wrote all about it, what is to know. And He said it is a personal experience of everyone, just He described all Sahaja Yoga there. And, also He said why should God makes you suffer? He is the most loving and affectionate father, blasting all ideas of Christianity. Also so many Hindus believe like that, Muslims believe like that, that you must suffer. But now some or other the exposure of the fruit is also coming out and also there is a kind of a turmoil going on, a kind I would say a tremendous dynamic effects are seen on human mind today, that it starts thinking what is this?

And you are the answer. You are the one who is going to convince them. And somebody was saying that, "Mother, why not we make every year, as a great year of propagation of Sahaja Yoga, propaganda of Sahaja Yoga?"

I said, "All right. If you want to make a year like that and something happens let us have but like our five year plan in India I don't want to do all the documentation and write files and files and files, nothing comes out." But today if you to decide that we are the ones who have to manifest this greatness on this Earth. We are the one who have to do all this. How can we be weak people? How can we be possessed people? How can we be fussy people? How can we be the people who are not saints? We have to come out of all our pettiness, all our conditionings and of all the things of our ego but not to fight it but through meditation, through witness state.

You have to be the witness. Now you are travelling. When you are travelling normally the witness State is how to criticize success. They never see the good points, they say, "Oh, look at that, this colour should not have been used, that's not good, that's not good." What is good is to be seen, what is good in you, how much good you can have and what is good in other people. This time I am telling you that on your way, on your tour, I hope you will all enjoy it very much more and you'll feel the manifestation of your Spirit, all around you, within you and in other people.

May God bless you!

Translation from Marathi:

Now, I was telling everyone that a big revolution is taking place. And I have delivered a big lecture about that in London. That revolution was taking place slowly and secretly, but now it has come to stand amidst you. It is standing amidst you and you are its representatives. If someone becomes a Hindu, he carries saffron flags and goes to fight, if someone becomes a Buddha, becomes Buddha means, what we call, that, the one who attains enlightenment, he is Buddha, but the one who calls himself Buddha, carries some other flag! But the who is Sahaja Yogi, doesn’t carry any flag and go! His attention is only on himself. Now, in our India, the first attention is that my wife is not alright, then my son does not have a job, then, my husband is like this! First of all, it is difficult to get out of that. And after coming out of that, then with our eyes, if we start looking around, then those eyes see that whatever we were doing till today, that was done with such lowly vision! How limited is our vison! How will become Sahaja Yogis with such a limited vision? Aho, those who have to spread the shade over the whole world, and those who want to give joy to the whole world, then such twinkling lamps are of what use? There are those big lighthouses on the sea, unless you become like that, of what use is our Sahaja Yoga? But even in that there such a lowliness and seeing that smallness I feel very surprized. I will tell you as I told them today.

That for marriage, telling the girl or the boy that, “I want a Marathi girl only or a Maratha boy only, (specifically) this boy only.” Is it? Then what will happen to you when he [tha- tha karaney]. Then, “Mataji, this happened, that happened” again another complain! Then,”Mataji, we cannot give up fasting.” Then die of fasting! Why are you telling me? I tell you to have proper food, live comfortably, then say, Mataji, we can’t give up fasting! Is this fasting like a snake or a scorpion that has climbed upon the body, it doesn’t come down? Similar to these, due to such various type of mundane, and very constricted, temperaments, people in our country cannot progress in Sahaja Yoga. Means, these people say you are saints and seers, because you are very innocent, that is their opinion. Maybe, you are, means, I do not differ, but for Sahaja Yoga only naivety is not enough. First, wisdom is necessary and should be understood that today on what wave are we standing? These mundane ideas that if we want to marry, we will marry in our caste only, we are Sahaja Yogis, so Sahaja Yogi is acceptable, acceptable, means, this word is too much here, acceptable, anything is acceptable, means from where are you, Mr.King, that you say anything is acceptable? But this “acceptable/ is ok” This word should go away from Sahaja Yoga. What is acceptable? Instead of saying ok or not, “Acceptable” Means all of you are Shivaji Maharaj or what? This matter should be paid attention to, that today we have come to Sahaja Yoga, is not only for our selfish motive, not for what we have gained for ourselves, whatever Mataji has given us, is so that we spread both our hands and give it to others; and give this joy to people, this happiness is to be given. That love should be given. But people with such constricted vision, how to tell about Sahaja Yoga? And the “Mataji, my lower back is hurting, my back is hurting, my hand aches!” it will hurt! “Day before, something happened at my work, I went there, this happened” Will happen! You are in Mother’s protection, are you worthy of it? Think about it.  The mundane ideas and limited views if you have to discard and today if you have to go to the battlefield, then, if at home “my vegetable / bread is cooked or not” if you keep thinking, then how will it look?  Therefore, our personality only has to grow, and like it is said, [mann kara thor] “Grow your mind” We belong to this religion, that religion, we do not belong to any religion! Religion belongs to us! We do not belong to any religion! We are Yogis, what is religion to us? We are ‘Dharamaateet” beyond religion. This pretence of religions that is going on, the day to end that [pretence] should come. At least let your children get that good fortune! Various type of our mundane ideas that exist, should be removed. Until we give up those mundane ideas, like a kite cannot fly if we tie a stone to it, like that, your ascent cannot take place. Whatever We could do, we have done. In this complete situation like this, Sahaja Yoga has been erected. And have brought all of you in the kingdom of God. Only there should be a capability of sitting there. Freedom of thoughts is required, if someone gives thoughts such as ”I am born in this dynasty, so I have become Maratha or have become a Brahmin” putting such blames on oneself, roaming around with such banners, Sahaja Yogis should be ashamed to do this.” I am a Sahaja Yogi, I am free. I am the one who is walking on the technique of the ‘Self’. Whatever you tell me, I am not going to listen. I am standing on the mechanism of the ‘Self’, my mechanism of ‘Self’ is on now, don’t teach me anything.” Coming out of these nuances of relationship, and coming out of this puddle, unless you come up like lotuses, then you are of no use to me and I am of no use to you. If now I come up with a campaign, like, in Pune “Let’s go to Savarkar’s Statue” means in Hindi, it is said, statue. What is to be done? going there! So, thousands are out! If enmity is to be taught, thousands of people, thousands of women will come out, running! Because it is hostility! But in the court of love, if asked to leave everything and get adorned, then there is no willingness. All that filth will be over the body ‘ we are this and we are that’.  Facing this situation, today, we are standing in Sahaja Yoga. So should not falter. Should be firm. Not only that, but such people should be risen, like, thousands of Mahatma Gandhi s we have made, thousands of Lenin s we have risen, and thousands of people like Abraham Lincoln s are standing, that’s what people should say! There is no difference between you and them! Nose, mouth, hands and feet, remain the same, only the light of the spirit, till where it has reached, should be seen. And we have become saints, we are saints, we [for the saints], all this is an obstacle, all these are blemishes, all these we will break, overcome, caste, creed, all this we will forget! Until you make this resolution, you will not gain anything in Sahaja yoga. And for us as well, this is a bother! Should become great! Whichever shore the sea goes, nobody says, “this is our Alibagh’s sea!” or “Mumbai Sea” Sea is a Sea. Similarly, saint is a saint. Of the many qualities of the saint, the main quality is that such superficial, small, mundane type of things, their vision is beyond that! Full of Everlasting love! So, take this as a challenge for Sahaja Yogis from the whole world, “we will see what you can do”. What lights you can light up that we will see. “We are this, we are that, they are that. “Who are you? Let’s see. Then? What should we do? Only this illusion of intelligence should be removed. That can be removed due to the strength of the Kundalini. You revere me as the Adishakti, agreed! I have to accept, I am. But what is the use? If in my Reverence, if you - the whole world is under our Mother’s Feet, and this is the world She has created, and we are special Sahaja Yogis of this world, take to this thought, then your imagination will change. Then all the wrong assumptions about yourself will be corrected and between you there will be love, and not only that, a tremendous energy is moving among you, this will be realized. And we have come together by a great force and this is the energy that will redeem us, you will understand this.

Translation of Hindi Part.

Today there are some people who know Hindi here so I always tell Marathi people to try to learn Hindi because it is your National Language. But will have to tell Hindi people, that if a little bit of Marathi is learnt, will be good. Although, I have to say, Marathi language, I think, is very mature and its depth is not found in any language. Yes, other than Sanskrit, any other colloquial language, for Kundalini, Marathi language is very facile (effortless) and very useful. But, Hindi language is also very highly placed, so Hindi language should be understood by all Marathi people, similarly, for you people, learning one - Marathi language should not be difficult.

What I am saying this today is that, we are standing on a revolutionary path. At this time, we are facing a great challenge that we are Sahaja Yogis. We have achieved Yoga. We are not like other people, who are full of soiled, filthy, thoughts, who do not love each other and who have violent temperaments towards each other. We are Yogis, we are the ones to bind together the whole world, we are special representatives, and we are saints. The qualities of saints should be completely noticeable. in us. When these (qualities) will be seen, when these will be perceptible, only then people will understand that Sahaja Yoga is a special thing. Otherwise, people will think, what if you are Sahaja Yogis? Your habits are the same. Your methods/ ways are the same. You have same fights, you also have the same groupism. All your habits are similar to other people, so what did you achieve in Sahaja Yoga? In Sahaja Yoga, we did not achieve on the outside but from within, we a tremendous energy existing and in our whole world this energy, its existence (effect) is seen. We can see that this energy exists within all of us and is moving within us. In everyone, its beautiful environment exists. And we know it in mutual love. Not only that, every second, every moment, this energy operates us and ties us to one another. This energy is the core thread that of the universe that we have got. And when we have achieved this, then indulging in such useless things, such absolutely mundane matters and wasting our life, we are not ready for that. We will have to evaluate ourselves. We will have to know what our value is, and what have we understood about our lives. I observe that getting into arguments is man’s nature. Whatever happens, they will start fighting over it. This is not seen even among cats and dogs! Anything happens, it becomes a matter of fights. There should be some discussion of love as well! Sahaja Yoga is a movement of love alone, nothing else is there in it, only a movement of love alone, and you are in that movement, in an extremely beautiful and extremely sweet atmosphere, [you are] enjoy. But this can happen only when your subtle being is so deep that you see that you are a representative of God and God is working this out through us. What a great thing, what a unique thing! Upon obtaining this unique thing, you should be aware about your self, and whatever is your personality, give it a huge form, there should be a greatness in it. This is the first day today that everyone has arrived, look how well everyone is sitting! It is a matter of pride for a Mother that so many of my children have gathered here from the whole world. But I wish every time that you become aware, you realize that a very big revolution Mother is organizing.

English:

I want you all to be extremely aware that your Mother is organizing a very great evolution in this world.

Translation from Marathi:

You all should be aware that our Mother is organizing a big revolution that will involve the whole universe, such a great revolution, and that we are a part and parcel of it. May God Bless you all. May God Bless you all.
