18th January 1990, Ganapatipule, India.

I am happy you have all been enjoying the music so much and enjoying your stay in Ganapatipule. This is the end of our tour where is a get together like a gathering as you call it and there has to be much less talking and much less worrying about things of less importance. We have to enjoy and we have to enjoy each other, to know each other and to understand what is this collectivity is. We are here of so many countries and is best is that we should talk to each other and find out their country, their styles and their names and their families and make very intimate relationships with them. So this is the idea of this Ganapatipule is that at the combination of it, we all meet together and that we have a very congenial enjoyable atmosphere. So I don't want to stand in the way of the music that was on. I would like Babamama to continue and also then we'll have other music.

We have to only see what we have gained, how much sensitive you have become to joy. How much conditionings we have dropped. How much we feel surrendered to the Divine and how our personalities have grown. It is more introspection that I was thinking about in the morning meditation and later on you should have tomorrow morning if you want some people can meet, as leaders can meet or talk to each other and can find out what they can do for the future. What should be the plans, what do you think is needed in Sahaja Yoga, all these things have to be discussed and to be understood. Because we are one family but still there is - everything works out just like one hand works out the other hand, it works out no doubt. It is we are part and parcel of the whole, no doubt. But still there is another communication which is also of your experiences, of how to develop better, how to work out better. How to spread it better? What thing will help, in what country? All these things are - can be discussed tomorrow, if you want, whenever you want to meet. The leaders can come and meet in My room. Say after the program we have had or early in the morning. I would like to talk to them about it. Will be a better idea that I deal with them personally on all matters. Now anybody who has any other problem, individual problem, any other problem, should give them in writing so that they will bring it to Me and I'll see to it what we can do about it. Because every leader must be having some problems somewhere and it should be discussed. So tomorrow morning I think if you come quite early, I get up very early. So if you can come say about seven o'clock or eight o'clock will be all right, we'll talk about it. That ten o'clock will be here to continue we the same presentation business that we did today. So it is going to be a long session. May God bless you all.
