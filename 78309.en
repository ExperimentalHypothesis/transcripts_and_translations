*In the following letter, Shri Mataji is talking about Gagangiri Maharaj and his disciple Madhukar Rao. Madhukar Rao has written the aarti for Shri Mataji. The word Madhu  in the verse "Jab Dil mein aaye tab *madhu* sangeet sun lo" has become *madhur* over the years. But originally it represented his name.

Therefore, instead of including his name, Raol Ba always used to sing  "Jab Dil mein aaye tab *sahaj* sangeet sun lo".

My dear Chhotu,

Many many blessings,

My trip to America has been postponed to next year. There are many reasons for this, but the real reason is that it is just not the right (Sahaja) time now. Therefore, it was not possible to go. Preparation for America will be needed.I will go in August next year.

It is very good that a meeting happened with  Maharaj. He had told me that you should send Sahaja yogis to me and I will guide them further in meditation. But the experiences of people of Mumbai are strange. Therefore, those people hesitate. When Avadhoot and Meenakshi went to Maharaj, both got caught up at their Agya Chakra, keeping them in a state of trance all the time. Secondly, More (A Family Name) and other sahaja yogis went to Maharaj and became unstable. People from Vasai and Bordi welcomed him wholeheartedly, at my behest and all those people deteriorated.

In between, Maharaj sent Madhukar Rao. While he wrote my praise, it was all borrowed (asking from others) knowledge. And the same happened with Khade. Then the people of Mumbai asked me, "What is this matter?"

The reason for this is that Maharaj himself is very great and many evil people are around him taking advantage of him. He has not given realization to anyone. He doesn't say no to anyone. He himself is in bliss and is aware that these all are donkeys. He told me that you are giving to everyone, as a mother you can give. But it is to be seen what these people give you in return. His experiences were bad. Till today, experiences of all saints have been bad. But now the number of saints has been increased.

So you are all brothers and sisters. You should love each other completely. If you give more to one and less to another, then there will be groups. This prevails in Mumbai. I am very tired of this groupism. This is a malignancy in Sahaja yoga. We all are one. We all are several cells of the same Virata. How can one depend on only one organ?

I told you that you should write about Sahaja yoga based on medical terminology. Gavin Brown is writing a book here. Gregoire is also writing a book. Then your writing will be useful. Write on theory and experiments.

Blessings to all.

Always your Mother,

Nirmala.

P.S. Please send the writing as soon as possible. - Your Mother, Nirmala.
