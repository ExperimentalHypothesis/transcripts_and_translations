Words that I would like to learn and I'm very happy that you have come. And I will request Matahi to save you. Now you ask me questions. Come home. Can we feel these experiences. What? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, you should, you should, you should, you should be right now. Why not? You sure you want to feel it first before asking questions. That's the best.

I mean, if you are a seeker, you should ask for that. What's this of asking questions? I'm not a political leader, not seeking votes. Best thing is that, yes, why not, and especially you. Firstly because you're Indians and you come from Kerala where Ravi Shankaracharya was born. White was born. Lake Province. You can, why not? Just put your hands towards me, you can. If you want to ask me questions, you can ask.

You see, it's a, it's a question of what you want. Not only that you can feel it, but you can see with your naked eyes, the rising of the bone. You can see the pulsation on the triangular bone. You can see the rising very clearly. Absolutely, with the stethoscope. Now we have Doctor Borgi with us luckily he's here. You can see it tries. Yes, that's the best. All right, to ask the questions first of all, the way you like, but to move forward. It's, it's a question just a split of a second to immunise, but.

There is a little part, the part of the food sometimes is blocked by your physical, mental, emotional disturbances, which are these different chapters which we have to nourish a little bit. Again, thousands of them are just like this in the villages, especially. That's why I said I'm more interested in the villages than in this 5 star hotel. It's very easy to give realisation treated before them I get it. It's very difficult task to work in London, but in an Indian village just like this house, just like. Because definitely this is a yoga movie. You have to be proud of it, but we have to know what our country is. We have to know our heritage myself. I ask, you see, if you ask me this question, I'll have to ask you one question, so that will explain. If I ask you what state did you realise you are a human being?

If I ask you a question, what state did you realise you were a human being? You won't be able to say. No, no, no training is needed for me. See, you are a human being. It is, it is inbuilt. It is all inbuilt, you see. So supposing you are a human being, so your capacity as a human being, isn't built within you, is it? You don't have to be told that you are a human being. In the series, it has happened. Yes, you are quite aware.

Can you tell me what permit it happened to you that you were aware? You know you are a human being in the same way you know you are this. You know You grow up like a child first of all. Still, you know. Gradually. A dog knows he's a dog. A human child knows he's a human child that he's not a dog. What I, what is the difference of uh between philosophy and the philosophy of mind. Oh, tremendous, absolutely tremendous. Now I would say one thing more again, you see, because I'm your mother and you must guard my, uh, estate about it because you see, the government has sponsored this and all this is the first time I have yielded to a thing like that.

So I don't want to fall into a controversy, but it's just the opposite of mine. I get it. Absolutely just their opposite. You just think of something like you give somebody a name. I mean, why do you need a guru to give a name? All right, then you give a name. There's a big Shasta. If you come to Sergioga, you will know that different datings are after surgery. Then we ch is wrong with you. Accordingly, you have to be told that take that name of that deity at that particular centre.

Then the kundalini moves from that centre to another centre. So you have to be told that there is no talk of kundalini or chakras or anything. You just give somebody a name, you see, it is like saying that, uh, take this, uh, toothbrush and brush your teeth and you'll have a leg. Before and after, sort of, it's all advertising thing. Moreover, it's much deeper. I've seen people who go to transcendental meditation are very difficult to get realisation, very difficult. We have got here 3 people from Transcendental. They had tremendous headaches. They suffered a lot. When they came to me, they were just rattling like this.

Now you might say that I may be wrong too, see, I may be wrong, but now how you determine this way that if you bring a math person, a lunatic person, he also ts this. If you bring a possessed person, he also travel business. In the same way they tremble before and rather difficult to give them realisation, they take time. No, I do not take. I do not take. I'm sorry. I do. They do. You see, these people are not me. That's a different thing, you see, this is the way it is always the human mind is from the other side and mind is from the other side.

Why should I claim? Does the son claim that I'm sad? Why shouldn't you? If you are that you are that. Do you claim that you are a human being to anyone? What is your concept? You see these Alcaras. It is a divine. Now, first of all, do you believe in God? Begin.

Do you all right, if you believe in God, God has to. Take you say from amoeba stage to shoot. How does it? How does he guide you? He has to have some way of guiding you. So, uh, one of his aspects, which is known as the Vishnu aspect, let's say the evolutionary aspect, takes different forms at different stages, comes on this earth, and tries to that like a fish wanting to come out of this. So a fish of that. Like that, all the Otaras are nothing but guiding leaders, which came from divine. There is another psychological way that they describe as Young has said. You was a disciple of God.

He said that through our unconscious, in our dreams they got. The divine power guides, the all pervading power guides. But dreams, when the time we are awakened out of dreams, we forget most of it, so the guidance is not good. After all, somebody has to tell you about the divine. I have to tell you where are your children. I have to tell you how you catch them. I have to tell you what are these fingers for. You will see all that we have done very elaborate. And these fingers, what are these chakras are? Actually, I studied your medicine just to talk to doctors.

I studied also a little bit of psychology to talk to the psychologist. Because God does not have language. So do your disciples claim that you are the second coming of Christ? No, I'm not Christ. Christ has to come, but when he will come, he will not spare anyone. That's what it is. I'm just preparing for that time because I'm a, he'll just come and slash out. He will come, but he is not going to come to give you realisation and to convince you of righteousness and say no, he's coming for the last sorting out what we do to our banana trees when the fruits are out, cut them out in the same. He's going to come for the last one, and that's a very short time, so we have to be careful. So what do you do actually You see what I do is uh this uh come here, come here, it's all right.

What we do is to. Now I'll tell you something about medical science, which is, you know, it's quite boring, but if you don't mind, I will explain to you what happens because you see, if you ask me to put on the sign, it's very easy to press the button, isn't it? But what did I do and how it worked out? What was the electrical thing? What was the history behind it? Of course, there is an organisation. So if you want, I can explain to you what I do. Yes, actually, I don't do anything I would say. It just it just happens that uh you have got already built in in the mechanism, the complete mechanism you you can open the page and see there is a picture of a human being sitting with the mechanism. You can see open yourself so you can have a look at.

Then I got to drive one of that so. Now you can see here, see this one, this is the picture. This is the subtle energy, a subtle instrument within us. This is. Now, Of course, I mean you can't see this with your naked eyes because this is an energy form, but if it is there or not for that, you have to come to Saga and see with your own eyes that this residual energy here, this triangular bone residual energy, rises like this and opens out. This is the baptism about which Christ has told you. He said that you are baptist, but not by the people who are graduated from theological college. You cannot graduate. You have to have it. You have to become a saint.

That means this must open out unless and until you are enlightened like a light. Which is enlightened like a car which is enlighten can enlighten another candle. Now you have to be a candle to begin with, and that is the can you are. You are already made like that. You are an instrument which is already prepared like this. You can say like this tape record. You are made like this like a uh computer, and you are just to be put to the maids and the whole thing starts for. It's the finding of the. Now what I do in medical aid, I have explained in my article here, which means this is uh I had addressed to the medical people and this is the address that you can see for yourself, but uh it was. Now, this one is here.

Now, uh, what you can understand is that God has made you from amoeba to a human being, all right? Now, after a human being stage, what does he want you to be? Why did he make you a human being? Why were you made? Have you got your fulfilment, supposing I make some machine, then you'll ask mother, why are you making this machine? That must have its fulfilment or not. That instrument must have its fulfilment, so you are made like this. It is already made. It's all prepared. I don't have to do anything.

Just what I do is when the kundalini sees because it is a consciousness which knows me. It just, it's automatic. How do you do it? How do you do that? You see, because it is a consciousness which knows which just runs. How do you make a fish rice to a bake? What do you do? It has the hunger. It is just in that. No, no, this is a residual consciousness.

The consciousness has many, many, uh, aspects. See, we have in different ways, we have consciousness. First of all, we have the conscious mind which you are listening to me, all right? You are listening to me. Now all the experiences and everything that you are listening to me is going into your past, so we can say that is the subconscious. Then the with which there is a conscious mind, which also thinks for the future. That is the preconscious mind. Now I'm talking about the super conscious where you become. One with all pervading, so you become collectively. You become that now they can feel your, they can feel your chakra.

They can see what's wrong. You, they are just like you to look at nothing, no difference. But inside they know, and you will also know because it is an actualization, not just talking a brain wave or just a sermon or sitting down giving a process. It is not. It is a happening that happens within you and when it happens, you become into some as collective consciousness. It happens. Just become that, for example, see human beings, they are better than human animals. How, how do you know their their consciousness is better? For example, you take a dog to the field. It won't mind, but human beings will mind.

A human being understands the be, the combination of colours a dog was not. This is a different dimension that you have to reach. All of us have to reach. This is your evolutionary jump now. Where you become conscious of that all pervading power about which should be here. It is so dynamic you can't imagine. Sitting down here, you can feel somebody's vibration. You can cureus. It is already built in, you see, like I come outside and I can push the button, the whole thing can start working because it's all built in. It started from amoeba stage or even from the, you can say from the carbon stage even earlier when it was just just the power which got into many forms and now that is expressed through you.

You go to another level of consciousness when you become collectively conscious, as I was telling Mr. Maharaja the other day, that first you know yourself, you know your God. Without knowing yourself, you cannot know God. Like without eyes, you cannot see the colour. You cannot know God without being in self-reli. If you go to a temple, what do you? You just do it. You have to become You whatever you may do in the name of God. God does not know you because you're not connected. It's like telephoning to somebody. Once your yourself is connected with God, then your own property, the some that you get.

Now you are a capitalist when you get your support, then you have to distribute. If you do not distribute, you're not happy, so you become a real communist. There's no forcing about desert floors. You can't sleep. Like the sun, sun is the greatest communist you can think, but if it did you not have light, how can it be? And then you do not want any divorce, it just goes, it emits. I'm talking of that awareness which we have not yet gone into. Shankaracharya has talked about it. Who has bothered about it? You see, our great politicians, I shouldn't say much against them, but what I'm trying to say, they are all English people.

We are more English than the English are, I can tell you. What we have to project is what we have. So our politicians cannot think that this is the thing we have got in our country, our spiritual heritage. Let us put this and manifest this. We will leave the whole world one day. If you get We are very big. You have no idea. I mean, you have no idea about yourself. Yeah And we are much happier people than them. They have to learn from us.

They have finished their family lives. They have finished their societies. They are very unhappy. The richest country, Sweden, and the maximum number of suicides. And for your information in England, every week two children are killed by parents. Legal children are killed by their parents, mother or father. Can you think of such a thing? Yeah absolutely animals. Where are we developing? Why not short socket and bring them round also?

That extremely unhappy people. And we have got this such a great thing, and I have got it here, you see, now in America I refuse to go there because the doctors there will immediately pick it up, you see, this is your thing, your heritage. You should have it. I have to teach them so they were all he, you see, knows French and he's from Switzerland. I had to teach him what is gonnaia who's sitting down here. He knows about fast because he's a car. But what about others? Ganesha is the same as Christ is. He's the same incarnation. It is Christ who is nothing else but Mahavishnu.

I can prove it on the kunali. You can ask any absolute question once you realised you get the vibrations and you don't know whether it is that. It is fantastic. But you see, I cannot have, uh, as you said that I can't have cheap popularity. You see, if I have pregnant, you will come to. And how can you charge money for such a thing? I mean, it's incentive, isn't it? Even to think like that, you cannot purchase God. And it's nice. I don't have to have ashram now.

I can always bring people to call. You see, you are a building an accident is a headache. Everything is a headache. They wanted to have a son involvement. I said, I will agree to Ashram. You collect, but I don't need any money from them. And how can I take money from my children. But I said if you want to have for this, but one condition is that no black market money is doing off and 70 years they have tried, they cannot have. For such wretched sinful people, why should there be a Just not one person has offered us that Mataji had this place. But I don't mind giving money to this my yogi, this UV that yo, all those people.

They have got loads of now this Rajnee is another fellow you must have. I don't know if I should mention it under your, uh, estate, but you know what sort of a man he is. can you tell us something about your and my education. I did medicine. I, you see, once I never needed an education as said, but I did medicine because I wanted to talk to doctors. I also studied psychology. And uh she's also a very well-known doctor and then she's also Was a professor of medicine. And the lady who have you now they are saying, the one whom they know about uh. In London, you see, her husband was my profess. And he could not believe that this is so they cannot, you see, the scientists cannot believe that there is all permitted.

What can scientists do? See, I don't blame them because if they see this is red, they say this is red. But supposing you have eyes like microscope to which you can see more than this. Then you can prove it to them. So I said, you take your realisation, then you can see this. Now they don't want to take. Now I cured this no doubt I've cured 100%. I've cured so many cancer patients, my disciples, and cancer cannot be proved by anything else but surgery. Take it from me. It was born with me.

So my background is that my father was a congressman, a very fellow congressman, and he also came to Kerala wants to do a lot of, uh, uh, for elections. He was a great speaker and also he was a member of the old central assembly where there were only two from Madar Pradesh, and then he was the member of the constituent assembly, then of the parliament. And like that, I have a background. I myself, I have uh been tortured by Britishers and uh they have really tortured my life because in 1942 I took a very active part. And actually we had to free it was important before getting free how we tested, but as soon as we got freedom, you forgot that you are in. I want. You see, I have no bitterness about it. You'll be amazed the British today, the younger British, the younger people are very different from their fathers. They are such excellent people that in the foreigners, I would say they are the best. Because they do not have a shift in the nature of the Americans.

Americans are doing only good shopping. You see, they're very solid people. They don't take to surgery easily. They see and then they come to. You see, they are the most blessed people. I don't know, maybe they have got blessings of this country or whatever it is, but they're the most blessed people. They are the most balanced among all of them put together. And that's why my husband got elected, and that's how I'm there. So what more background you want to know? I have got 2 daughters and 4 grandchildren.

And you know about my husband. Now what was it? No, who was, uh, I'mumata. Now who could be my room will tell every one of you is really to be very frank, because I have to understand about people through you, I understand. I really don't understand you. And all of these people, so I should say you are my. That's to be How old are you, uh, how young? I'm very old. I'm 40 I'm 56. I'm 57 now, yes.

In terms of what? what? Well quite all Age has to be accepted, you see. Uh, even, even God has to be a normal person to talk. I have to become old. I have to just, I have to be just like you. I'm not here to show miracles. You have to be absolutely a normal person, absolutely a saman, just like you. So that you'll accept me much more. Not at all.

It's all nonsense. It is just a show. What are you doing? You see, if you're wearing, say, uh, those dresses to show that advertising that Amazon. It's just happening within yourself. It's happening within yourself. Nothing. On the contrary, I bless all the families. Family is the most important. And do you know there are some very great souls who want to be born in this country.

Not anywhere. Why do we have overpopulation? Have you ever thought of it? We used to pray for fertility. We remember that a few years back. And why people are trying to be born here in England there is a recession. In Germany there's recession. People are giving money incentives to produce children. Children are not born there. In Sweden they're borrowing children from India and they're also going to Colombia and taking children with them or orphan children and all.

Why are children are not born there? Why? Because this sensible man will be born in those wretched horrible conditions. There is. No sensible map. That's why we have to bear the load. Don't you be afraid of your co. I think they are more. Yes, they are no doubt you are correct there, but I still people don't, still people don't open their eyes. They do not have wisdom to see, you see, because they have a glow around them and they go with a big pomp and show and this and that.

So people are so superficial they accept. Like I was telling about Rane in London, only 9 people started their show, and it's a very funny way they started, you know, basically they had no money, so they took out all their clothes, started dancing and shouting. Some people came round to see them. Now they have thousands. They don't know what to buy. They will buy the whole of London one day. But one simple thing in this respect, in this licence is. Why do they need a guru? I mean, they can teach all of these gurus. There is no rising of the kundalina or anything.

It's all happened. It's not rising, it's pulsation by becoming naked. If people can become realised, and I think in Kerala, half of the people who. It's all absurd, you see, you are intelligent people with a heritage. It's a silly thing that he's absolutely silly and foolish and he's a car. Is to insult the baby, to insult all the chest. He is the one who has taught people to, uh, absolutely. Converted We'll be shocked the kind of people live in that. You have no idea. These people, uh, cannot even tell you.

I mean, you are too innocent to know what sort of people. If you don't give in the paper, then I'll tell you what, but don't give in the paper. It's too much shocking because we think oh they are very happy. There is a law in England and all over the Western country. That a man cannot sleep with his mother. Sleep with it doesn't mean the way we sleep with our mothers, but they did to me, and the daughter cannot sleep with her. There's a law. We don't have such a law that don't do dirty things, but they have a law. Now they are wanting to break that law, and there's a big procession at the parliament. I've seen with my own eyes in the BBC on the BBC.

They are demanding that this law should be broken and we should be allowed to enjoy it. Now, can you think of such a thing? With all your advancement. They are silly people, idiots, idiots. You see, with ego one becomes an 8. You must have read to see that's a ramara. In the rama they have shown how even Narada became an idiot. It is. So even Narada can become an idiot, but they are all idiots, absolutely idiot. You don't know how to talk to them.

Absolute idiots. What they have got. They haven't got even one cotton do that you have got. They have only plastics and nylons. Why do we need nylons for this nice planet of ours? God has given us such a beautiful planet. Why do we need so many clothes? Or we can live in a hut. Now they are coming and living here in heart and we want to have just. Now more questions You must, you must, all of you must ask because you see, I don't, because intelligence is such, you see, it always ties back, but this is beyond intelligence.

It's happening. Supposing a seat. Is to be sprouted. What intelligence are you going to put there? It's a living process. You cannot do it by thinking. It is built in you, it will work. But here the people are very well educated in English. Not in Indian. It's a son.

It's a big sun. Look at it or not. Jessie, not only he but all these, he's an Englishman. Now we have Philippa here. She's a great writer, but she's she's there. She's a writer anyway. Oh, they have sorted it out. Once they have found the truth, they have sorted it out. All mark and they are all Shankara, everything. Nobody did Shankarai who reads Shankara in our country, tell me.

who is he, is he? I mean, that would be very sad. So that really testing. How can people respect us? We don't know anything about our own motherland. So it is a that is not only the. You can see the evolutionary process, but by evolution you reach the reality. And it's a revolution, complete revolution is also a harmic religion, for example, in the temple. Not so much here in the north. What are these pundits doing horrible people, all of them have rues us.

Sitting down and taking money from this person, that person, we want to. Where all these people walk all the way, you must have heard about this cult which the people go singing, walking for miles together for one month they walk and go to that temple, and there are these pundits called the uh that means the beaters. They, they really take the heads of people just like a coconut. Actually, like that, and they are minting money and they need such aa and such a wildlife. In the name of God, actually they are mammals, they are not human beings. So it's a revolution against them also to prove what are the mantras, to prove what are the deities, what is the reality. We have to get rid of all these nonsensical things which are sitting on our body. And on our. Who is the grandma is the one who has sought the grandma, the real realised so. Rahman is not born.

And somebody told me that in the geeka I think who was the one who has written Gita. You know, Ria at least. He was a son of a fisher. That's too legitimate. How could you write that you can be born as a grey? You cannot. See, what we talked of the past was this the aptitude that you are a Brahmin by aptitude. That means you are seeking God in the Brahma. But the ones who are. Who are supposed to be chattis are the people who are seeking power for job.

But joy, you can only get through this all conve through your own being, through your own spirit, which is the beginning. Which has to come into play, but when it comes into play, these vibrations start flowing, which we call a state. They start flowing from like Christ has said, somebody touched his robe, and he said my energy has passed. What do they know these Christians, what do they know of Christ? Imagine this pope wearing all these big, big diamonds on top of his body. How many diamonds did Christ have? And in Colombia, I went down and I went to uh Chile and Argentina and foolishly they said, if Christ was not born a poor man, then he would have been more effective. How to talk see if Christ was. He is a rama. Those who are hanker of kings, how can they be kings?

The king is satisfied so couple you make me sleep. I sleep if you make me sleep that I see. Such a person doesn't need it. How much do you need really? During the 7 days, See, whatever you want to do out of me, I'm here. And I will see you and I told Mr. rather that I would love to meet the villagers. And I'm for them. But here I come. It's a good thing in a way. I, I must praise your minister very much.

I met him for the first time, but I liked him for one thing. He's such a rare person. Uh, I mean, to think, he said that this is the heritage of our mother, Daruha many languages. This is the heritage of mother. We should project this instead of casinos. See, they have casinos. They have ballroom dancing much better than you have. Actually, nobody comes to India with that idea. They come here for peace, for peace, about which they know when they come here, you give them cheap chairs and this and that. They do not want you to ask all of them.

They come for peace and for relaxation. And he said that that we should project this instead of projecting uh their sort of nonsense. That's why perhaps I'm in England, because English can teach usur. We won't learn it directly from it. Is it so that we have to learn some English? Uh thank you. If you want to have experience or anything, you can stay on. I would like to see. And moreover, one more point I would like to see because Baji has there that there is a village where people are suffering from. There's all these things which we have to neutralise it.

How do you leave those things? You neutralise it, you neutralise you're not going to give up one thing to another, but this is what our surgeons tangible. Yes, I know. No, no, no, not at all. Then you go from one extreme to another extreme, you see, you don't become politically, but you be free within yourself. Then you do not jump from one to another. But then how can you win? How can you win? I mean, people are not going to leave. They will, they will.

We can neutralise. We are about to neutralise them. They will, you see, the winning is which ways we have, we have to have, we will get them. We will get that. There are so many other ways we can work it out, for example, cancer. You cannot cure cancer except through this. You must get self realisation. So all the cancer people, let them come down. We have a doctor here, he's practising in London, and now I've cured a doctor's wife of cancer. So they will have to accept this.

They will come, they will come, they will have to accept there are so many other ways you can make them understand. Well, um, do you have a, a car in London because I got a lot of, we had one lady working very hard in Tehran, um, but another branch. And. Like everybody else, they're all refugees now and they're all in a bad state. So if um like you ask to get in touch with. Just, uh, can you give me one of the things? Have you got one? You must have really given a very elaborate all our exhausted so we'll send it over to you. We have given in details all the things about this, how is the mechanism within you, the subtle mechanism, how you get connected with the mains, see. How you are made and everything we have tried to do it in short and in quite a concise way, but we have given quite good information about it and please have a look at it.

What I think that I would like to meet the people of England who are actually sort of are they think they are in charge. I would like to talk to them about it because these young people, you see, they, uh, they have no say. But this is the problem why I say you, you will end up going into politics because there's no way anybody in in a western type that can do anything without having some game, playing some game to do it and to bring it to be recognised because the people are, as you see, prisoners of their material were in life, and it blots out the problems at the moment they're living lives to blot out from escapist lives, to take people away from escapist lives, you have to offer them the most incredible inducement of all. It's not like a backward country where you can, you can like in Iran, you've had first you have the Shah, the monarchy, the glory, then suddenly you had Islam the other way around. But this is the only thing that would take away. The Shah fell simply because he didn't understand that Islam where they where they get all these people. But I mean Englishmen are not concerned about that. Englishmen are concerned, I say about their football and television programmes and and everything else, life is too full, so you have to slowly get things closed down your government is making prohibition, but I would say that your young people are. You see, to get into politics and this and that, it's a good idea. I have my attention on that, but I would still say I have to prepare them.

They have to be something of a higher personality to impress on others. If they have to be defiled like others, I have to prepare it. Can you imagine? I worked only on 6 people for 4 years and now I have so many, only on 6 people. They were all hippies and taking drugs, but now there are 300 people. Who have given up drugs beautifully. And they have had all kinds of experiences and everything. So it is going to work out. But I mean, if you think that some people would be willing to do something because You have to think that you could be the leaders tomorrow. But I mean, do, do you have, um, I never see when I'm in a garden.

I never see any much on yoga and related. You see, the trouble is we, we have been giving it in one yoga today, one article with very big difficulty they've published. And in the TV people they gave all kinds of faith to such an importance and everything.
