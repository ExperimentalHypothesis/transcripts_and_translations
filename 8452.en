(HH Shri Mataji speaking informally, greeting people and speaking to yogis:  All those who have come for the first time, you can come forward as much as possible, closer. He’s your friend? Good. You can come here. … Today I will give again a little gist about Kundalini because they have come for the first time, these people, so I think I should tell about Kundalini. These people are experts now, about Kundalini.)

If you show this diagram to a doctor or someone or a scientist, they will say what sort of a thing it is? And, whether there’s something like this or I’m just telling about some sort of an imaginary thing within us? One cannot see these things within us, which is, they are placed in the spinal cord because they are actually energy areas. These are the areas from where the energy is emitted, a kind of an energy. Because we cannot see them, we do not know that they exist but their manifestation we can see.

For example, the doctors can’t say what has evolved us from amoeba to this stage. They cannot give an explanation as to why did we become human beings. What is the part of our brain, which carries all this instrument, that we evolved ourselves from amoebas to this stage and then, why have we evolved? Why we were made human beings? What is the purpose of nature to make human beings out of us? This cannot be explained by Doctors. Scientists cannot say why so many things happen and, how there is gravity in the Earth. How is it that so many things are moving with such a speed and there is no collision? Now a time has come for many scientists to believe that there is some sort of a power, which is beyond human comprehension, which is all-powerful and which works, in such a manner that we cannot see the working of it but we can feel it.

Now, we have to know that if we were complete, if we had fulfilled our vision from amoeba to human stage, if human stage was the last and the supreme thing then we would have given answers to all the questions. But we have not been able to do so. Why? That means we are not yet complete. We haven’t yet found out our fulfilment. We do not know why we are created like this, what are we suppose to do, what is our aim, what is the aim of the nature?

But when we cannot explain something, we go on probing into it through science, through various ways of human enterprise you can say, the way we want to find out things but human being, being a rational being and his thinking capacity being limited, there are certain things we cannot understand, we cannot transcend. This is a problem, which we are facing today. We are feeling quite lost. You can see the result of this: that people are talking about the destruction of the world. There are many people who are prophesising that the destruction of the world is coming on. We are all going to be destroyed. This comes out of insecurity within human beings because they cannot give answers to many things. They cannot explain why so many things happened which they cannot control. There are so many things that are beyond them.

But there is another way of moving about it. One way, the knowledge can come from outside, probing into everything. As I said, if you want to know about the tree you can start counting the leaves, you can start counting the thorns, you can start seeing a flower under the mic(roscope) but it could be that you can enter into the sap of the tree from inside and you arrive at the outside. That’s another way of going into it.

As I have told many-a-times that in this room if you have come in and if it is dark you can understand about it by probing into smaller spaces. Say, there’s a chair, all right, there’s a chair here and there’s this and there’s that, and gradually you can feel whatever is placed in this room but still you do not get the complete picture and you do not know how to relate to things and, you do not know how to make a complete integrated picture of these findings.

But, there could be a method by which you can just put on the light by which you see everything at the same time. This one is known as Enlightenment. Now, the scriptures have talked about enlightenment. Christ has said that you are to be reborn again. Every scripture has said that you have to be reborn, that you have to be self-realised, that you have to know yourself. There is Self within you, there is Spirit within you. There is Atma within you. Everyone has said that. Those who have read even an ordinary religious book can know this and those who have read a, a very intellectual and a very proving book also can see that they are always talking about a breakthrough. We have to breakthrough!

Surprisingly in the modern times they’re having such an absurd or we can say, such a manifestation of seeking. It was never so before that every person you come across says: Oh, I am seeking. Except for very, very gross people, everyone says that I am a seeker. I am seeking. But if you ask them what are you seeking, perhaps they do not know, they are confused about it. They are not sure what they are seeking or perhaps that whatever they have read or whatever they have understood they have their own conceptions about those things.

But, if truth exists beyond our comprehension that we are not conscious of, then truth has to be as it is. We cannot comprehend it, not only that but we cannot organise it. We cannot command it. We have to accept it, accept-it-as-it-is. We cannot say that this should be the truth – Oh, I expect the truth should be like this. I expected it should have!

Now, when I present before you a case or any hypothesis, as a scientist what you have to do is to listen to Me, open your minds out, not to close them. If you are a scientist you must to keep your minds open. If you are not a scientist, of course then you are dogmatic; I cannot help. But, if you are a scientist, then you must keep your mind opened out. Then when you listen to My hypothesis, then you can experiment with it. Anything that can be experimented with is a scientific thing. You can see for yourself that whatever I’m saying is true or not. If it is scientifically proven, means that if you see with your own eyes and if you can see the results of it then you have to believe. But if you just said at the very outset say, no, no, no, no, how can we believe then how can I proceed, what am I to do? That would be just shutting your self away from the reality.

So this is how it has to work; in any seeking, in any findings, a person has to be an open-minded person. Maybe what he seeks may-not-be what he has so far conceived as truth. May not be at all! Maybe something very different but he should be prepared because he is the ‘seeker of truth’ and he doesn’t want falsehood. When he finds the truth, then he has to say, yes, it is so and has to accept it.

So, second point for a scientist is that he should not be identified with something about which he does not know. That is called as Misidentification. Supposing say, you are an Indian and some Indian has said XYZ, so you are identified with that idea then you are not a scientist. A scientist has to be above all these things and he has to have a very, very open mind to see that the truth that he sees has to be what-it-is. What others have told you, what others have talked about [to] you, or what you have known so far, or because your father has told you, because in the country such and such person says, all these things are Misidentifications.

So, a person who is courageous like that or I would say, a person who is standing on his own feet to face the truth, they only see but who believes into somebody else’s things and somebody else’s ideas, such a person, why should he be believed? Why should he be believed to, or I should say why should he be exposed to truth because truth also has its own protocol. Because Truth is also Love, absolute Love and it will not be exposed to those who cannot fix it. It’s not a jarring thing. It’s a beautiful thing. It’s extremely beautiful.

The truth is that what you have so far known as yourself is not yourself. There is something beyond you. There is something, which is, we call as Spirit and this Spirit exists within you. But you have yet not felt the existence of this Spirit. This is the truth I propose before you. Is the truth what I say, as a hypothesis, as a hypothesis and not being aggressive about it. I’m just saying it’s a hypothesis before you and let us see if it is so; with this open mind for a start and then we have to go further. How do we do it? I say that it cannot be done through your rationality. You have reached your stage of your development now. Rationality has to be left behind. For example, to come to this hall you had to come in your car but you had to leave your car there, to get inside. Supposing if it is something subtler than your rationality can pick up? So how do we do it?

So, we go in the other way that so far we have become human beings without knowing anything about it. What did we do? Did we stand on our, our heads or did we do anything about it? What does a tree do to become a tree from a seed? It does nothing! It’s a spontaneous happening done by the nature. Nature does it by itself. The tree grows by itself. You cannot do anything about it except for giving some water to it, perhaps, looking after it, catering it, allowing it to grow but you cannot make it sprout. The seed sprouts by itself.

So, if you move in this way, then we will realise that whatever so far has happened to us, whatever transformation has taken place in us, in becoming human beings, in our evolution has happened spontaneously. We had no brain. So whatever we have, has to happen further, for our evolution, if we have to go further on, if we are not complete, then it has to happen and it will happen spontaneously.

When we say it will happen spontaneously then one may say then how to do it? Again the same question! You are not going to do it. It has to work out spontaneously. Like a lamp now, here, you can see all these lights. If they were out and there was no light, one enlightened light could enlighten all of them. Now, what did the light do? Nothing! It was a catalyst. It just touched the other thing, which was ready and it got enlightened. It touched the other thing, it got enlightened. In the same way our evolution is going to take place. Somebody who is evolved – like one fish came out of the water, felt the land and became the reptile, then many came, and then many (more) came, and then shoals of the fishes came. In the same way, it is going to happen to you. Even in science if you find out, say if you discover electricity, one person knows about it then he tells ten people, they experiment with it and then the whole world knows about it. In the same way our evolution is going to work out. So, first thing is that it is a spontaneous happening.

Now, there must be something within us to bring forth that spontaneous happening. There must be something that works it out, like in the seed there’s a premule, the germinating part of the seed is the premule. So, as in the seed there is a premule, there has to be something in us also waiting to do this job of our further evolution, where all the Saints, all the Incarnations, all the great people had talked about it, is our heritage. They were not mad people! They never told us lies. Did they? How can you say they told us lies unless and until you have verified, until and unless you have found out that we can do this rebirth work.

This happening is, as I said, is spontaneous. Now, what is the thing within us that brings forth? Now, I say, as a hypothesis again, it is a hypothesis, which I put forward before you, is this that within us is placed this kind of a mechanism. This is not in all details because that will confuse you but it is, I should say, the basic things are placed there and these are the energy areas, which are placed within our spinal cord in this fashion [i.e. as per the Chart of Subtle System] and you can see that germinating force sleeping there, in that pink area.

That germinating force only brings forth this happening. It rises through the various, various forces or we can say the various centres and opens out that portion by which you enter into that subtle area of consciousness by which you enter, through-your-Parasympathetic Nervous System into the Central Nervous System. You start feeling, the Central Nervous System starts feeling the Parasympathetic.

Now it is a very complicated thing and can only be understood by doctors, what is Parasympathetic and the Sympathetic System. But Sympathetic System is that system by which we attend to our emergencies and Parasympathetic is that system which is autonomous, works on its own and it gives Harmony and Balance within us.

So, it so happens that the Autonomous Nervous System, which we do not know what, how it works. It is an auto-nomous, means it works on its own. Who is this Auto? Who works our heart? Who works our digestion? Who, who gives all these a, ideas to our brain? That System suddenly becomes known to our Central Nervous System that means we become Conscious of it. This is the Happening. Once this happens then you start feeling Collectively Conscious. This is the Subtle Happening, that you start feeling about everyone.

Now, this happening of this rising you can see with your naked eyes, in so many people, not in everyone. But, in so many people you can see that there is a pulsation in that area of triangular bone that cannot pulsate otherwise. You can also, with a stethoscope can feel the rising. If you want to feel you can really feel the rising of the thing. You can hear, (Shri Mataji makes a sound that is like a burst of wind forced through a narrow tunnel) the sounds, hard sounds while the Kundalini moves. Clearly you can see.

When the Kundalini rises, the person in whom the Kundalini rises, suddenly becomes Thoughtlessly Aware. He’s aware but there is no thought. Such a situation is an impossibility! Nobody can become that even for a second! All thoughts stop and you’ll start seeing that you are in a realm where you are aware of everything, you are listening to Me but no thoughts are coming. At this time Kundalini crosses this point [Agnya Chakra]. When the Kundalini crosses this point, that time, you have really enlightened your Central Nervous System and start feeling in your hands a kind of Vibrations flowing. You can feel the vibrations flowing. When this ‘vibrations’ start flowing you see first a little heat. Some people a lot of heat depending on what sort of a body you have. The heat rises out. The heat is due to the friction you have had so far within yourself. All kinds of extra-energies you have used for emergencies and for your own whims and for your seeking, or whatever it is, maybe you are sick. Then gradually you will find in you, will cool down and from your hand a cool breeze start.

It you remember Christ, somebody touched Christ and said my energy has flowed from me. It is said that from the body of the Holy Ghost you get the cool breeze coming out. All these scriptures and everything that is said in the scriptures, not only in the Bible but in all of the scriptures of the world, whatever they have said, the time has come that you are to be convinced. But not convinced by just giving you a lecture or a brainwash but by an actual happening, by a complete seeing of it, scientifical.

Now when the Kundalini passes over, the eyes become dilated just like a child’s eyes. Some people can’t see for a second also and then Kundalini rises and you feel absolutely fine. Now with some of you, you must have definitely read some description of Kundalini, I’m sure. I must say I was shocked to hear what these people have to say about it because they have described Kundalini to be a some sort of a hot tempered lady or some sort of a terrible force that is going to ruin you and is a dangerous thing, if anybody has read about Kundalini – that’s why we never put our name as Kundalini Yoga because nobody would come near Me.   But so far now, we have had thousands of people with us. We have never seen such things happening to anyone. On the contrary people become so peaceful and so far - and so joyous, and the joy is so much that some people when they get it, they do not know how to express that joy, they laugh!

The complete integration takes place but as I said, we have problems. It is a very subtle happening. It has never happened like this, so much en-masse, I don’t think so but the time has come! The Blossom Time has come so it is happening in that way and it should happen. But if it happens, you are not going to deny it because it has happened! There are many psychologists who give reasons. I see people that even if they get it they deny it. They deny it at the beginning. That’s human beings! Perhaps they think how are they worthy of it, how could they get it? There are many instances. They get it, they do have it but then they loose it, they start doubting about it because it is the Awareness, it is the last energy that thinks, that understands, that has its own things, it has its own protocol. It’s a living energy, integrated energy.

Some people loose it because they have certain problems within them but it comes back again, it works. For example, in the very rush of it, in the first rush of it comes, it hits the Fontanelle bone. The Baptism takes place. It gives you the experience but then again it goes down. If you are sick it caters to your sickness, if there is any other mental problem, it caters to that. Now here there might be at least 50% people who were physically sick, maybe 25% people who are mentally sick. Absolutely somewhere from lunatic asylum and they are absolutely cured of their problems.

So what happens, when the Kundalini rises She integrates all these centres and then She gives the balance. The power that is being exhausted by the Sympathetic is again refilled. So by that first of all your body, your physical being, your emotional being and your spiritual being is completely soothed.

But then you become Collectively Conscious. Immediately you do. It’s a happening at such a rate that is a real work; you really become something else. Collectively conscious means that you immediately you can start feeling others on the fingers, you start feeling the different centres that are there. Now, all these I can decode and you can find out for yourself. For example, if somebody is suffering with a, say, with a cold and throat trouble, (inaudible) You ask the person, are you suffering from this? Supposing the spark is here, you ask the person is your father suffering, they will say yes. Many people say how do you know that I have got liver trouble, because there is heat here in My hand. It suggests, is the Kundalini suggests that there is liver. All these centres, which is accepted by doctors, that the Sympathetic Nervous System is expressed but they do not know what centres are there, how they are expressed, what is the manifestation, all the details they do not know. Certain things they do but they do not from where they come.

So, when you start feeling all these centres you start understanding that what is the problem. So you do not see what dress he’s picked or what personality, or what sort of a job he is coming (from), whether he is a king, queen or a beggar. You are not bothered. What you are bothered about are the centres of the person. So immediately you say all right, this is catching, that is catching, that is catching.

Now, if you give vibrations there from your hand you can fulfil that plan of Kundalini Awakening. It is so simple that even a child of two years can do that. We have seen that, a child of two years old because if they are born realised, then if they are born with the knowledge of Kundalini they can do it; two year old child can do this. If you put our ten children here and close their eyes and put one person before them and then ask them, what is the matter? They will raise the same finger. This is the meaning, that something is wrong with his father. His father relationship is not all right. If this is so, the mother relationship, only in the heart. There is something wrong with the heart chakra. And it is amazing to see these children, how they work it out. Immediately they will get out the patient and they will work it out they will say: here is the problem, here is the blockage, now see, raise it and they can cure because they can feel it within themselves. It is subjective knowledge, as you can feel the smell, say the dirty smell. Human beings can smell; animals cannot smell. You don’t have to tell your child that there is a dirty smell, he immediately puts his hands to his nose and says, oh, horrible smell! Everybody feels, which is our subjective knowledge. In the same way this becomes our subjective knowledge. Some of them have to put their hands towards the picture but some of then don’t have to put. They just can do like that.

But, you do not suffer with it. You just see it because you become a witness. Then you call, oh, how do you know Mr. So and So, like that. You become a third person, you start seeing how I behave and then your colossal ego that is there and, then you say, look at this Mr. Ego of mine is trying to suggest me. And then you also see the possessions that are within you, also see the ideas that have come to you through falsehood, through reading the books that are false. You see all those things so clearly and then you can cleanse it out. Instead of going into the details and names and things and all that, I would suggest that they have some ..? Have you got it or not?  Those who are interested can get it from these people, the names of the chakras and all that. That is, that, those names are in the Sanskrit language. But all these centres are expressed or manifested outside as plexuses, in the gross, which we know the names in English language. But, that doesn’t mean that if it is Sanskrit it becomes an Indian stuff, it is not. Because, in those days, in India, people had lot of time and they discovered so they gave it in Sanskrit. If they were Englishmen they would have given in English language. As you have found out something about science you have given it English names. In the same way, whatever they found out in India they have given it Sanskrit names because that was the language available at that time. It is not an Indian stuff, an Indian stuff as such but the findings were in India because it was discovered in India one should not, sort of, shut it out.

But there have been also the other side, people, those who have had no knowledge but just heard something they tried to make huge big books. I have seen such huge big books and all falsehood. I was amazed! How can they do it? They write about Mandalas and they write about this and they write about that. All kinds of things they have written without even, without even understanding that whatever is written so far has all falsehood. There is no, no way of knowing how they have written these false things. I just cannot understand because this is after all is subjective knowledge and you can write whatever you please? Who is gong to ask you who is the authority of that? And all such books naturally find their way to your places because they want money. Wherever is the cash, they go there. First they went to American, then Germany then to England and to all the places wherever they have cash. Where they can cash it and can get money. And people think, oh, that is such a great thing, such a great thing and buy it and spend such a lot of money. It’s a sad thing that human beings, thinks they can buy everything. They cannot.

Subjective knowledge has to be achieved. Has to manifest itself. You cannot, if you cannot feel what is hot and what is cold by giving money you cannot feel it. It happens to you because it is within you. It is all built in you. It is like a living computer within you, which is just put to the mains and it just starts working but if you think you can purchase it, you cannot. You can think about it, you cannot. It is a happening. It is something that happens within you by which your Consciousness becomes a Collective Consciousness. It comes into your Conscious-being the Unconscious. This is a happening and not a, just a rational working. Any saint, you can say, Kabira Das or it can be say Nanaka, any saint you read, Kahil Gibran or any saint, whosoever has lived, if you ask him how do you do it? How it is? He will say, I cannot say. You see I’ve become dumb. How do you ask a dumb person what is the taste of the jaggery (made from sugarcane and date palm), of a sugar. How can a dumb person say? I become dumb because the thing is, it is a happening. It happens within you. You cannot describe it but it just happens within you. You can see it happen.

This is the breakthrough which was historically, was described from the time of Socrates it started. He said that you have to seek. Everyone has said and today the time has come for it to happen but as I said, it is a very subtle thing. It is not like, I say, all right, take this the toothbrush and you have it, brush yourself and you have face sparkling. It is not like that. It’s not a quick thing but it happens like a jet, no doubt, but it has to settle down. It takes time to settle down and then you have to know how to do it because the knowledge about yourself also comes into you. You can see your own chakras. You can see this is the chakra catching. You’ll find now they will say: Mother, my Agnya is catching, my this-thing is catching, my Nabhi is catching. They will come and tell Me. You yourself start seeing yourself like, if you are in the car, you cannot see the car. Supposing if you get out of the car then you can see it clearly then you can repair it. Sitting in the car you cannot repair. So, when you see yourself you can repair it. This is the method, which is a very quick method I would say and can be en-masse.

We had another method that people used which is called as Hatha Yoga in which first they thought, why not start with the cleansing of it. Start it from the very beginning. The basis and everything, and built it up very nicely and then enlighten yourself. But it takes too much time. Thousands of years people have spent, from one life to another life they have worked like that building up themselves gradually, keeping themselves aloof from the society. This Hatha Yoga that, these days you practice is all, all absolutely rumble-tum. It’s noting but only all physical side of it, which is very, very imbalanced and wrong but what I was talking about, the Hatha Yoga that they did in the forest. In the forest they used to go and live a celibate life, completely dedicated life and there they used to achieve this cleansing first of all and then the enlightenment.

But Sahaja Yoga is a system first you achieve it, just get into it and then you cleanse yourself, you understand yourself and cleanse yourself and, it goes up to the roots, it completely changes you. That is why it is a living process. Supposing something has gone wrong with this building at the foundation, you cannot change it because it is a dead thing. But a tree, if it is spoilt even at the roots, we can change it. In the same way, Sahaja Yoga completely transforms you, then the manifestation of the Spirit starts and the manifestation of Spirit is this, what we call in Sanskrit, what is called as spunNa (sphuraNa) and that in English is, throb. It ‘throbs’ (unclear).

The throbbing in the heart is called as Anahata, it means it is without percussion. It throbs. That is why it is called as Anahata and that throbbing starts flowing from here. You can feel that pulsation. And with this pulsation you become absolutely hollow and you see the working of the dynamic force and, you are amazed that there are already all kinds of telecommunications and all kinds of tremendous things already built. You are unnecessarily worried and carrying the load, like, sometimes as I say, that people who are sitting in the aeroplane they are told not to carry too much load so they put it on their heads. In the same way we are putting the load on our heads and that whole thing falls down, so call tension, everything goes down.

Now again as I have said many-a-times, again I have to proclaim that cancer is one disease that cannot be cured but for Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is the only thing that is going to cure cancer and that is the challenge because Sahaja Yoga gives the balance to the Sympathetic. An over activity of the Sympathetic causes it, by any means, which can be due to some infection, can be due to anything. Over activity of the Sympathetic Nervous causes cancer and to neutralise that thing we have to activate the Parasympathetic. If you know how to do it; we have done it.

But for doctors it is very difficult to believe in God! They can believe in their stethoscopes but not in God. One step forward you have to come. One step forward that there is God. Not there is only God but He has many aspects and He has incarnated many-a-times on this Earth and, He has tried to save us. And He is the one who has given us these - as one of them was Christ who incarnated on this Earth and there are many other incarnations who came on this Earth to give us guidelines and they are all built in us like the milestones, they are within us. They, they demarcate our different periods of evolution and when it comes to the, our final mode, they all help us and they are the people who are dominating all this, or are bestowing upon these different centres which are having their energy in. They are all there.

But, if you tell a doctor that you have to take the name of Christ if you have to get rid of this problem, they’ll say: What? Take the name of Christ? They can’t believe it. If you say that, yes, you have to say the Lord’s Prayer for this otherwise you cannot be all right, they’ll say: how can we believe that you have to say the Lord’s Prayer for this, it’s an impossibility! Then you say that I’m sorry then I cannot cure you, you have to take that name otherwise it is impossible. If they have to get cured they have to take their names. That is what is known as Mantra. That is what is known as a chant, that you have to awaken these different deities within you, in yourself. That is only possible if you are authorised, it means you are a Realised Soul and that if and when you are connected with that Divine All Pervading Power. Then only you can do it. Only by saying some mantras you are not going to get there.

Like the other day somebody had a discussion that what is wrong with a mantra? I said there is a science. Anybody gives you a mantra? Anybody can give you; even a donkey can tell you a mantra. Why do you need a guru for it? But, does he understand what’s wrong with you? Does he understand where are the chakras? You cannot give one mantra to somebody because the Kundalini moves. It moves from chakras to chakras. The person, does he know where the Kundalini is? What mantra is he giving you? Say the mantra is given for the lower chakras and the Kundalini is standing there, what is the use? There’s a science. They give one mantra and everybody is chanting that. Maybe that the name that is given to them is not of God but maybe of some devil! How can you fall for calling God without having any authority about it? You cannot just sit down, all right, Jesus, come along and there, Jesus, Oh, let me help the child! Why should he? Where is your respect for God! How will he come to you? We expect God to stand, we see all the time giving Him orders. Very demanding we are: I must have a job, my child must be alright, my wife must be alright, my father must get his property and the other person is having troubling things entering the country, so, God, help him also. And, we are waging a war against another country, so God help me there. Poor God must be thinking what sort of these human beings are?

So, it is necessary that we should understand Him in His full way and that you can understand through this knowledge and a rapport is established. How do you know there is God? How do we say there is God? All right, somebody has said, why should we believe whether there is God or not? Then what happens, as I have said your computer starts working. If you ask is there God, immediately your vibrations start, yes! If you ask about XYZ, is he a real man, a guru, immediately the vibrations stop, stop and you start getting tingling or heat: Oh God, throw him away! Automatically it happens.

All the Absolutely Truths you can find out through your vibrations as they have been described since long time back. They are described in the Upanishadas, they are described in the Vedas; they are described in the, later time when Shankaracharya came in. They are described by Buddha, they are described by Mahavira; they are described by all people; they are described by Christ, by Mohammed Sahib. In Namaz that Mohammed Sahib taught was nothing else but Kundalini Awakening. Now if you tell the Muslims they will cut my throat for it. Absolutely that! He never taught them to fight. And the Sikhs were taught by the same person Nanaka; and Mohammed Sahib and Nanaka they were the same people, we can prove it through Kundalini. They were the same people but the Sikhs and the Muslims are fighting, and what he told them not to drink, they are doing.

So, you see there are so many things like that. It is very confusing. If you go to a church, you see a priest, he is telling one thing and then another thing. You can’t believe. How can there be God? Organized religions give you such a fright; you just don’t understand. Then you go to another place, say, to an Indian temple where they are selling ganja (cannabis). What? At a temple they are selling, selling ganja? These are not godly people. These are all satanic. They have captured all these places and are selling God. They are not divine but because they are there that does not mean God does not exist. He exists!

It is only for us to open out ourselves. It will happen but the truth has to come. But it sounds very fantastic! Absolutely fantastic! And when it happens, it is so fantastic that people just don’t believe in it. But believe in this, that the time has come and that you are the people, the very specially chosen ones. Why do you under-estimate yourself? Maybe you are the people chosen for this by God so you have to have a very calm attitude towards yourself, a very open attitude and a cooperative attitude. If you are not cooperative you see I cannot garland you. I say all right, you are realized. See, you cannot give a person a false certificate. If my daughter is not realized I cannot help. If she’s not, she’s not! You cannot force somebody. You cannot give somebody a false certificate about it. It has to happen within you and when this happening takes place then there is no doubt about – they do not start doubting.
