Liberty Radio Interview. London (UK), 12 July 1999.

MODERATOR: (speaking clearly and enthusiastically) Shri Mataji Nirmala  Devi, recognized world-wide for her pioneering work in awakening the natural healing energy that lies within every human being. Apparantly it's called the Kundalini and we'll be awakening yours hopefully this hour. Shri Mataji, that actually means Mother, was on GM TV [for a popular morning TV show] only last week and the switchboards were actually bombarded with calls. We wonder if Shri Mataji  or Mother will have the same effect here today. Keep it on Liberty  for a spiritual awakening in a few moments time.

(WEATHER REPORT AND SONG.)

MOD: Now my next guest, we're very honoured to welcome to the studio today. Her name is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Shri Mataji actually means Mother and She is recognized worldwide for Her pioneering work in awakening the natural healing energy that lies within every human being. She travels throughout the world at Her own expense, teaching this life-changing technique to millions of people and apparantly we don't have to part with a penny. On GM TV, only last week, the switchboard was flooded by viewers who'd all experienced strange phenomena whilst listening to Her. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi joins me now. Welcome to the show.

SHRI MATAJI: Thank you.

MOD: It's a pleasure to have you here. Now, you studied medicine and psychology in your home country of India. Is that right?

SM: I did.

MOD: And now, you travel the world teaching Sahaja Yoga. Is that right?

SM: Yes, correct.

MOD: And, how did you learn this technique? Is it particularly well known in India.

SM: It was used long time back, but the tradition was they used to give this awakening only to one person among thousands. First they used to test them, cleanse them, do all kinds of things. And ultimately they used to give to one person. One person to one person. That was the tradition. Only what work I've done is to I have tried to find out human beings, what the problem with them is. Why can't we have en-masse Realization? And it worked, it clicked and I am doing that work.

MOD: So, the very fact that tradition was passed on to, like you say one in thousands of people. Would you say that is why the tradition was actually lost over the years? The tradition itself, did.

SM: Ya. It's not only Indian tradition. It has been in many countries. But people aren't aware of it. See, everywhere they have talked about it, that there's t  ¥his power in the sacrum bone and that it is to be awakened. Even the Greeks knew about it because they called it as sacrum bone meaning a sacred bone. So, it is not only Indian, it is all over. People knew about it, but they didn't know how to awaken it. In a far-fetched place called Bolivia, they know everything about it. They said two saints came from India and they taught us, long, long time back and but we don't know how to awaken it.

MOD: Now it's called as Kundalini, am I right?

SM: Kundalini.

MOD: Kundalini.

SM: Kundalini means a coil. It's coiled up into three and a half. It has some mathematical relations. That's why it's three and a half coils. That energy's coiled up.

MOD: And we have to unravel those coils, is that right and let the energy flow?

SM: Ya.

MOD: So essentially it's an energy force that flows through all of us.

SM: No, that Energy is within you, dormant. It's not yet awakened. Once it  ¥ is awakened, it passes through six subtle centres. And these centres are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and also spiritual being. So, when it is there, enlightened. When they are nourished, we get rid of our diseases, we get rid of our mental problems, we develop a balance, peace within and, ultimately, what we get is the joy.

MOD: So, why do you think those energies within us, then, have been suppressed all these years?

SM: Pardon me?

MOD: Our energies because you said they're not awakened, so, by definition, that means that, that they are suppressed. Are they just suppressed?

SM: No, not suppressed. They are in a dormant state.

MOD: A dormant state.

SM: Ya. They're not suppressed. But then, they are to be awakened. It's like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten many candles. It's like that. If you get that awakening, you can awaken thousands.

[SILENCE]

MOD: It's fascinating. My gue  §st is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, recognized worldwide for her pioneering work in awakening the natural healing energy that lies within every human being. It's called the Kundalini and, hopefully, we'll give you some tips on how you can awaken yours in just a few moments time.

[SONG]

MOD: My guest today is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Shri Mataji means Mother and that we're awakening a dormant energy in you today. Such is the extent of the awakening in the country when viewers tuned in to GM TV last week, that we thought we must welcome Shri Mataji to the show to see if she can awaken the dormant energy, Kundalini, the Kundalini, within all of us. Now, can you, can you, is it something that you can do, actually, at home on your own or is it something that we need you to help us do?

SM: No, you have to ask some enlightened person to do that.

MOD: Right.

SM: As there is a candle which is not enlightened, it cannot get enlightened by itself. So, you have to go to a person who is enlightened.

MOD: Like yourself. And this is something that you can actually do over the air now, if anyone was listening?

SM: Beg your pardon?

MOD: Is this something you can actually do now, on air 

SM: Yes, I can. I'll try. I'll try. [soft chuckle]

MOD: Okay, great. How do we do that then?

SM: How?

MOD: How do we actually awaken the Kundalini?

SM: "It's a Ñ you want me to do it?

MOD: Ya, ya. Ya.

SM: All right. I would request all of you to put your hands like this 

MOD: So, hands out.

SM: Out like that.

MOD: With palms facing upwards.

SM: Yes. Palms relaxed, like so. And ah, I have to tell you one thing is to, first of all, you have to forgive yourself. Is very important. You have to forgive yourself. You should not feel guilty. Because whatever wrong you have done is finished now. Why to feel guilty? The second point   Ãis you have to forgive everyone. That's a very important point because there's a centre here, here Ñ

MOD: In the forehead. In the forehead. Ya.

SM:  on the optic chasma, which is very constricted and if you don't forgive, it won't open. So Kundalini won't be able to pass through that. So, you have to forgive everyone. Logically, if you don't forgive, you don't do anything. Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you torture yourself. So, best is to forgive. Forgive everyone. Is very simple just to say, I forgive everyone. That's all you have to say. Just to say. Now, put your hands towards me like that, both, I mean towards your, maybe, radio.

MOD: Towards your wireless, ya, ya, ya.

SM: Towards, both hands. Now, what you can do is to put the right hand 
towards Me like this and left hand Ñ you have to put on top of the fontanel bone area.

MOD: Right. So the left hand.

SM: Above the last centre.

MOD: Right. The left, the left hand goes just above, just above the 
centre parting on your head.

SM: Ya, that was the soft bone in your childhood.

MOD: Right.

SM: In the fontanel bone area. You see?

MOD: Right. On top of your head.

SM: Ya, just above.

MOD: Right.

SM: And you put your hand, not on top, but above. And see for yourself if there is any cool or hot breeze-like thing coming, some vibrations.

MOD: Right. So you would you would feel air, warm air or cool air ?

SM: Ya. But they are vibrations that are coming in. They look like air, cool air or hot air. Little higher. All right.

MOD: Uuh, ya, ya.

SM: Now, you put the left hand towards me like this and put the right hand on top of your again, on top of your fontanelbone area. This is the actualization of baptism that you really feel a cool or hot breeze coming out of your own head. Now you can move your hand and see for yourself. If it is cool, well and good. If it is hot, also all right, but that means you have not forgiven, you have not forgiven yourself and you have not forgiven others.

MOD: Not forgiven. So that means if you have your hand above your head and you're feeling hot.

SM: Ya, hot. Then you better understand that you have not yet forgiven everyone. That's there. So, better forgive everyone, so it becomes cool again. Now, it has to be cool is the perfect state.

[SILENCE]

MOD: So, if you feel a cool air, then it means you're in a better place than someone who's feeling hot air.

SM: Now, I'll blow in the mic, if you don't mind. That will have an effect, better. Keep the hands like that only and I'll blow.

[LONG SILENCE WITH SOFT BLOWING SOUND]

MOD: So, what is it people we'll be feeling now at home?

SM: It will be coming out. Now, what you have to see is that on your fingertips, also, you feel the cool breeze.   ÊOn your fingertips and in the centre of your palms you'll feel the cool breeze. Maybe a little bit hot you might feel , if you have not forgiven yourself. Some may be there. You will feel it. And once you feel it, you should know that you are in connection with this all-pervading power of Divine Love, which is known also in the Bible. It's called as the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost. So that's the Ñ you start feeling now that your connection is established. But still, you have to grow into it and there are problems within you, so we have follow-ups and all that. We have centres everywhere where you can go and ask them and they will tell you what's wrong with you. That will correct you physically, mentally, emotionally and also spiritually.

MOD: And we'll give you those details in just a few moments time. Keep to Liberty for more tunes, more chat and more fun and more from Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi and don't forget to give us a call if you've felt anything at home.

[SONG]

MOD: And my guest today is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Shri Mataji means Mother and I have to say we've seen from her quite an effect from ouraudience. We've had quite a few calls so far from people who are experiencing the cool and the warm air that you described. I should explain, if anyone's just joined us, that we just did an exercise on the radio with Shri Mataji, who is recognized worldwide for her pioneering work in awakening the natural healing energy that lies within every human being called the Kundalini. Now there's some awakening going on. What's the next stage then, Mother?

SM: Then you have to perfect yourself. You have to know everything about it. About a month, if you spend on this, you'll become a master yourself. You can give Realization to thousands yourself.

MOD: Is it, is it really that easy though?

SM: Ya, ya [soft laugh].

MOD: I thought some people though 

SM: It has to be very easy, isn't it, because so important.

MOD: Absolutely, so more and more 

SM: It's so vital.

MOD: so more and more people can do it.

SM: It is the last breakthrough of our evolution, last breakthrough of our evolution. And it has to happen to all the people. The kundalini is present in all the people, whether they are this nationality, that nationality, colour, creed, religion, doesn'tmatter. Everybody has this power to rise above to this new realm, which Einstein has described: that once you get your Self Realization, you jump into the torsion area he called it.

MOD: So, if we awaken it globally, do you envision, in time then, where we would reach, I suppose, a utopia, because a lot of people might say, Mother, who were listening, that there are so many bad things going on in the world. Would you argue that is because that Kundalini hasn't been awakened?

SM: No, because human beings are to be transformed. You see, human beings have all these weaknesses like greed, anger, hatred, all that. All these things you just forget. They just drop out and you become a beautiful personality, which loves and which enjoys.

MOD: And you say this is something which can be awakened in all of us, everyone, anyone who is listening has the potential to do this?

SM: Ya.

MOD: And you can actually learn how to do it yourself. There is an eight week series of follow-up programs which you mentioned, Mother.

SM: Yes, yes.

MOD: Mother, in which you can learn more, to practise the techniques of Sahaja Yoga. We must stress, you don't part with any cash for this. The first two of these will be held on Wednesday the 14th of July at 7:30 p.m. and Wednesday the 21st of July at 7:30. They're on at the Great Hall, the Kensington Town Hall. So, if you did feel anything at home or perhaps you didn't but would still like to fi  »nd out more, then you can call the Sahaja Yoga information line. That's 0181-9305621. That's 0181-9305621. There are also Sahaja Yoga centres in over eighty countries around the world. Those details available once again on 0181-9305621. Mother, it's been an absolute pleasure. Thank you very much for joining us.

SM: Thank you. Thank you very much.

MOD: And the best of luck with everything in the future.

SM: Thank you. Thank you very much.

MOD: Not at all. My pleasure entirely

BIG MAN (with deep voice): "Ya, there's one this Wednesday, um, it kicks off, they all kick off at 7:30, and apparently you part with NO MONEY whatsoever - and this must be why, ah, one of the reasons why it's taken so long for This to come to the fore, because anything like this, if you're parting with money, they like to knock it down.
But they're not asking you for any money. You go along, it's totally gratis, and there's one at Covent Gardens (tells all the Sahaja Yoga programs in London).
And I believe there is a number, which I can't see, have you got the number there? There is a number-
