Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Mumbai (India)
Talk Language: Hindi | Translation (Hindi to English) - Draft

(Man) Why has he come into this world? He does not even think, 'Why have I come into this world? Why did God create me? What should I be doing? What is the meaning of my life? Is eating, drinking, producing children and dying the ultimate goal of my life?' Then, instead of living simply, living with simplicity, living with goodness,...... (Pause - audio missing)...Movies are made. People watch them, that they did this sinful act, that sinful act. As a result of that, this happened. This disease happened, that disease happened, got this problem. We keep watching it day and night - which should be called self-destroying. Today, this problem has occurred. Even today, someone comes and tells me, 'Mother, my husband is like this. My child has gone mad. This has happened to my daughter and You fix everything! Fix my husband as well. Fix the children as well. Get my daughters married too.' Arrey, what is your spiritual wealth which you have with God? If you go to the bank and say, give me one lakh rupees, no one is going to give you even a penny. You should also have (earned) some spiritual wealth   with God. What spiritual wealth have we accumulated? Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, many people get realised. After getting self-realization they think, 'Yes, yes, Mataji, I got a lot of coolness (Vibrations). I got peace.' It means, they are (as if) asking Me for a certificate. Haata jhalan thand. Jeev thand jhala. (Marathi). I don't need a certificate whether I helped you get your self-realisation or not. Do I have to show a certificate to God? Now you have received your realization, now you accumulate your rewards. Now you can do so. Now whether you have gathered rewards or not, this should be seen.

Now see, this is a girl. She has no previous spiritual wealth (merits)s. Neither does her mother nor her father. Her mother practiced black magic and her father was involved in innumerable ‘businesses’ (bad/ adharmic acts). He kept running after dozens of girls. So many lives he ruined. Father-in-law is one example and he is another. All the previous spiritual wealth has gone to waste. After that, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, if a person thinks that 'Yes, I should get peace. I should be peaceful. I should get happiness. That's it.' Then you have not received any philosophy (comprehension/understanding) of Sahaja Yoga. you have not received any benefit of it (Sahaja yoga). Discernment should come from Sahaja Yoga. Wisdom should come. One should know through Sahaja Yoga that the lamp which God has lit inside us, this flame of the spirit which is flowing from every part of our body. We are knowing (feeling/sensing) it as Chaitanya. After receiving this Chaitanyas, what spiritual wealth have we accumulated from it? What special work have we done? Otherwise, man lives so superficially. He spends his whole life in this. He spends many lives like this. Eating food, getting married, visiting a guest, inviting someone, that's it, apart from this, he doesn't have any other thought (orientation), not even a little bit towards progress or upliftment. If we have such shallowness towards life, and then if we are killed like insects, then what is the surprise in that? Because what is your importance in God's Kingdom? What hand (contribution) can you have in God's Kingdom? You can see in any government, where people do destructive work in any way, they are thrown out (banished). Or if they cannot do any kind of work, become completely lazy, they also do not get any salary, they die of hunger. Similarly, in God's kingdom, if you do not accumulate any spiritual wealths, you will not receive anything. (Then to say) 'Yes, I have got peace. I have got it. Mother has given it to me’. There is no gain in putting my poster everywhere. There should be “deep establishment” (sincere attention/sincere meditation). There should be depth. Think about it, what all you have done(achieved) in Sahaja Yoga? You have been in Sahaja Yoga for so many years. Read Kabir for learning about Sahaja Yoga. You will observe, (his)‘“deep establishment" (sincerity)/ depth. He was also a human being like you. But his ‘depth’ that means even until now if you listen to one of his verses anywhere, a person sinks deep (in meditative state). There is no depth within us....(Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi). If someone comes, your eyes move there, at least keep your attention here.  Do not move your eyes here and there, sit with a straight attention and listen. There should be a kind of respect towards oneself. There should be respect. Our life is not so useless that we waste it on such (shallow) things. We should not waste our human life in earning a few bucks. Our human life has come here today after passing through many births and after that we have achieved so much through Sahaja Yoga. Now what have we used this life for?

Today I felt very happy, I had gone to a place. They told me that, 'You have a disciple. He cured our son's illness.' I said, 'What is his name?' They told me some name. I don't remember. I don't even remember the name. I recognize my sons by their eyes. But I felt very happy. Otherwise, ‘just cure my child, cure my father, fix my job, fix my so and so’. This one thing happened. When that happened. After that, the second thing was, 'Mother, everything happened because of you. I got this. I got peace.' Alright, if you got it, what should I do now with you? You should also achieve something. You should also accumulate some spiritual wealth. So first understand your meaning. See, today by looking at this girl, today you will know. She is possessed by a bhoot badha (evil spirit). Whenever she comes in front of me, the bhoot does this (these movements), isn't it? You all have seen it! You will say, 'Mother, she is innocent. Why did God give her pain? Why would God ever do injustice to anyone?’ He is the ocean of compassion. He is the ocean of love. He is eager to give you peace. But if you people do not want to take it, then what can He do? He has given you freedom, right? If you people use this freedom for your own upliftment, to add to your spiritual wealth’s, then infinite amounts of His blessings will be found in Sahaja Yoga. There are thousands, lakhs, crores of such blessings lying around for free. To take those blessings, to get that ultimate bliss, you should go deep within yourself. Like if you do not have a cup inside you, then shall water be poured on a stone? A man who has no faith in himself, and no respect at all, who is wasting away every moment of his life; shall the Kingdom of God descend inside him? And even if it descends, what will be the benefit of it? You will have to add this spiritual wealth. Add this spiritual wealth in every moment, in every word. Even a single word that comes out of the mouth can become a mantra. You know that when I speak, the Chakras inside you start spinning. Similarly, when the reign of love comes on your tongue then, every word that you speak becomes a mantra. And whatever you speak becomes ‘the truth’. Now the doors of Infinity have opened. When you have been included in the Kingdom of God, what is greater than this that can happen (with you)? But at this time, if you do not adopt that dignity, that greatness, that seriousness (sincerity), then how long will anyone let you stand at the door of God? The throne has been prepared for you, come and sit. But if you do not have the power to sit on the throne, if you do not have that sincerity within you, then what will be achieved even after sitting there? It is important that the people who enter the kingdom of God should first understand that God is the Almighty and it is so, He who does all the work. He completes all the work. After entering the kingdom of such an Almighty God, we should leave our ego. This can happen only after Sahaja Yoga. Not before that. Until you get self-realization, you cannot leave your ego. At that time, you should say, 'It is not me; it is You. “You do your work”. I am watching. Merely as a witness.' This can be completed/accomplished only after Sahaja Yoga. It cannot happen before that. As I said, if your motor has not started, then how will you progress further? After the awakening of Kundalini, when through the piercing of the Brahmarandhra your chitt (attention), reaches that ‘'region’', only after that this work is accomplished. If such a big crown is placed on the head, but if your gait is not of that level, will that be gracious? Everyone should sit and think about what spiritual wealth we have gathered; and the kind of benefit we have received from Sahajayoga; how many people have we tried to give similar benefits to?

To reap the benefit of Sahaja Yoga only for yourself, is not a big speciality. This is not our personal property. This is not just worldly property, but a universal property. This should be given to everyone. It should be shared with everyone. And everyone should receive this bliss and peace and everyone should get the light of the soul. You know that in this city of Bombay, there are thousands of people who do not even know that the spirit is awakened within them. They do not know anything. However, you have come to know a lot about the spirit. You have recognized the spirit. You have recognized it’s light. That light has awakened within you. Whatever you have received in this birth, you had not received it in any birth before. Ahobhagyam! (Great Luck!) Now, after receiving such a huge wealth (Blessing), we should account for what all different spiritual wealth (punya)s we have accumulated. As soon as we start adding the account of this, waves of happiness will start rising. The way (lifestyle) by which you used to gather happiness till today, the exact opposite of that style is now operating. Like earlier, if you went to the market and bought something, you would feel great happiness. Now if you give something to someone, then, you feel happy. Earlier, if you used to feel happy saying (associating with) that ‘this is my brother, this is my sister, this is my so and so. I have to fix this; I have to fix that. They are my children; they are my father.’ Now, you will feel happy in accepting others. These boundaries and limited tendencies when they will be broken, then, you achieve happiness. Earlier, you used to think that you will get happiness by telling lies or by saying something hurtful to someone. Now you will get infinite happiness by just saying a single loving thing to someone. We do not know how to talk with love. I see people, they do not know how to talk with love to anyone. Whatever happens is so artificial and so bound, totally unnatural. There is no spontaneity in it. There is no pull in it, no warmth. We talk to others superficially. But after Sahaja Yoga, we can talk with utter (sheer) love. You can say even a single word and no one feels bad about it. You just saw how I told this girl, although I had scolded her in a way. But she understood.

Few people have experienced a lot of bliss from Sahaja Yoga. But unless you go deep into it, you are not going to gain anything. You know that in our programs, out of thousands, at least half of them receive their self-realization. And after that, they sit at home. They sit at home. Then sometimes you find them somewhere saying, 'Maa, yes, yes, I felt great bliss that day!' 'Then what happened?' 'Then I kept sitting in that bliss.' 'Then what happened?' 'Then some Guruji came, I touched his feet and from that day onwards, my bliss disappeared!' 'Then why did you go to that Guru? If you had to go to someone, then you should have gone to someone who asked for help. You should have gone to someone who needed help. You should have told him. Why did you go to such a person?' The reason for this is that your vision is not yet fully open. You have not recognized the vibrations. You cannot even be (physically) near such a person. I have seen children who are realized souls, if they see such a person coming into their house then, they will run out from the other door. Or if they are small children, they will start crying, wondering what is this kind of a person who has come? If there are dogs, they start barking. If they see a photo of such a person, they will start barking at it. And if you cannot even recognize through Sahaja Yoga that which person is of what kind? What is he doing? What and in which way is he telling us? Is there any meaning in this or not? Then he may even be a Sahaja Yogi! Whoever he may be. If you cannot recognize this, then you have not yet recognized your vibrations.

So you will have to go deep into the vibrations. There will have to be depth in everything. Why does this depth not come? Every time the same question arises that why is it not there? Because you do not have any respect for yourself. You do not know yourself, what you are? Man does not know himself, what he is? Now everyone (great poets/saints have) said,, yes, ‘you are not what you appear to be outside, you are what you are inside’. This is a mere saying. But now I have shown you in reality (that this is true), right? If a person does not fully identify himself even after being self-realised then when will he do that (recognition)? One should have complete faith in oneself. Everyone is eager to have darshan of Mataji. But first be ready for your own darshan. First, have a darshan of yourself. Put a garland around yourself, perform your aarti, look at yourself. But your own ‘Self’ is lost. Your own’ Self’ is hidden. When your own ‘Self’ awakens completely, then you can see yourself. You should learn to see yourself. And your mirror is your society. Society is your mirror. In society, a man exists. People say about him, 'Oh my God, who is this man? How (from where) did he come?' Absolutely magnetic. Clean, absolutely pure. He is one from inside and outside. Dignified, as soon as you see him, you feel ahaha, how pure his vision is! He is full of love.

As soon as we see him, the society says, 'Ahaha, what a man he is!’ He may die, be it a hundred years, or two thousand years, or five thousand years, the soil in which he shall be buried will spread his fragrance. There is a man who comes with a big pretence from outside. He is a Tilakdhari, so and so. ‘I am so and so, I am so and so’. It works for a few days. People believe him, it happens. Later, they will not see his face in the mornings. Those paths have opened for you. That way has opened for you. But do not be satisfied with only your own happiness. Meditate, go deep within yourself through meditation; and until you do not share this depth, and do not add to the spiritual wealth of others, joy will not be abundant. No matter how much wealth we have, and until we do not share it, we will not get joy. And if we do not share it, what will happen? We will become distorted in a few days. You must have noticed that those who are miserly, their money goes away in other ways. At this time, you should understand that those people who have got their enlightenment should devote (dedicate) themselves completely. You should do the same by bringing depth in yourself, just as the ocean sends many clouds in the sky.  It is not that the ocean is deep, so it pulls all the water upon itself. It is deep so that many clouds can emerge from it and spread across the world; even then, the wealth within it will not be exhausted. And then the same water is pulled back into it. Each one has to accumulate their own spiritual wealth. You have to work hard for that. 'What should I do now Mother, I have children in my house. I have this, I have that. My husband is like this. I cannot do anything. My wife is like this.' You have such examples of such people amongst you, who have a lot of problems in their house. But they are accumulating their spiritual wealth. After all, this house is not going to accompany (be by our side) us but our spiritual wealth shall.

You all know the story of Valmiki. I don't need to repeat it. This doesn't mean that you should be evil towards your family members. People always take the opposite meaning of it. This doesn't mean that. Because whatever I say, you should not presume the opposite meaning of it. I mean that you should love your family members a lot. But unduly whatever happens like you sit and say 'my child, my child', there is no need for you to do this. Well, keep doing everything, like providing them with food and drink, giving them love, arranging everything systematically. I would say up to this extent that you should love others at least as much as you love your children. You find it very difficult. Well, if not that much, then at least do half of it. Start at least. First start, then when you start enjoying it, then you can do more.  Enjoy Love. That is joy, that is it. Love is joy. Love, which keeps flowing all the time. When it returns back to you, waves of joy flow in. When it departs, it is love; when it returns, it becomes bliss. I do not see any difference between love and bliss. Everything is love and this is a very big truth also. Nothing else is true.

Now in Sahaja Yoga some of you have reached there. Some people have reached there right now. Some people even make arrangements to go to hell. About this I will just say that look at those people who have gone higher. How did they go? Merely with the occurrence of ‘dedication to yourself’, then everything will be done. As soon as ‘dedication to yourself’ comes, you will understand that your ‘self’ is happy only when you become collective. ‘Collectivity’ becomes completely your own. It becomes part and parcel of you. Just like you see everything with your eyes, in the same way your attention becomes collective. It is difficult to explain this before self-realization. But those of you who have had realization, they know what collective consciousness is. But now, those who have (their) collective consciousness limited only up to 'my father, my mother and sister' and not beyond that, their boundaries have been made. This has to be broken.

I want Sahaja yogis to progress more and more day by day. May they sit down (grow) deeper. One should have one’s own dignity. One should have one's own seriousness (sincerity) and one should sit (establish) deeper in it. As you sit (grow) deeper in it, you will observe that you will become more and more collective. There is no difference between you and any great soul. The only difference is that they became collective and you remained limited to yourself. The best way to break this limitation is to get self-realization. You have been given self-realisation, but again and again you keep growing in your own boundaries. And even when you grow, you keep on growing the boundaries. You do not break it. That boundary has to be broken. As the boundary breaks, you will understand that you will become collective. Now this many people are enough for me. I do not need more people than this. I can enlighten the whole world through the light of this many people. But even these (number of people) are not so settled! Everyone's lights are wobbling. Sometimes they suddenly go down, sometimes they come up, then they move again, then they turn here, then they turn there. If these many lamps keep burning steadily (continuously) then, Diwali shall be decorated. There is no need for more than this. But this many lamps do not remain lit. You know that people get entangled in small things. They fall down.

Go deeper. Go into the collective. Then you will be the leader of the world. The leader of the world. Not of a particular community or a particular country. But you will be the leader of all the collective people. You are a small cells in the body of Virat. Now the awakened cells shall sit in the place where the work happens the most. Like brain cells, heart cells, liver cells. Now these cells keep on moving. These are special awakened cells. And if they remain unstable, then Virat's condition will also be the same. Like a person whose liver is bad, or if someone's brain is bad, or if there is no love in someone's heart, dryness comes. Whatever God is and whatever Virat is, you are His part and parcel. You never think like this. If there is even a slight pain in my little finger, then also my whole body hurts. Think in the similar way, that if even a single Sahaja Yogi goes on the wrong path, then every part of My body hurts. If you start thinking in this way, then you should really try your best to be aware about how to settle down and go into your depths, go into the profundity. Before Sahaja Yoga, I used to say that you cannot do anything. Do not condition yourself, do not brainwash yourself. Do not read books. By reading them, you will feel that 'I have to get up early in the morning today, I have to sleep in the evening. I have to do Puja at this time. Then I have to go there. After going there, I have to do Hatha Yoga. Then I will stand on my head. Then I have to do that.' Don't do all this. Do transcend in Sahaj. But after Sahaja Yoga, when you are self-realised, when you have entered the Kingdom of God, now you should implement it (work it out). After that you will have to implement (work it out). Now your institutions (instruments) are operational. When institutions (instruments) have started working, then you will have to work it out otherwise it will have no meaning. Your daily work continues. Your daily business continues. Everything keeps happening. (talking in English) But that, which is the real work, it does not happen.

I am going to speak in Kavasji Jahangir hall tomorrow. Bring as many people there as you can, your relatives, your family members, start from there. Bring as many people as you can tomorrow. And tomorrow I shall talk specifically about Sahaja Yoga. God has given such a tremendous power within us and how it should be used. Tell all the people you meet, 'Come to Maa once, see, you will have to come'. Tell all the people, 'No, you will have to come there'.

Through advertising, most of the people who come are those who do not have any seeking and afterwards, get sort of lost. But if you bring your relations, or people whom you know personally, then if each person has twenty-five people, even if ten out of them get lost, one can still keep track of the (other) ten. But through advertising, some fragments came from here, some fragments came from there, some fragments came from there; and after that everyone realized ‘yes yes!  we cooled down’, after they all leave, and afterwards, all the fragments got lost. My efforts go to waste like this. That is why you people, (who are like) points in the middle, or pivotal points- if they bring twenty-five people each with them. Just as you give an invitation for marriage, in the same way give an invitation for Sahaja Yoga. And if you bring such people to Sahaja Yoga, make them benefit and observe them, then a big group of each of your people can be formed. Now sit and think how many people you can bring. Tell them to come once, go there and bring all those whom you have brought so far.

When someone falls ill, you bring them. 'Mother, this is my neighbor's sister's, her so-and-so's, so-and-so's, real father-in-law, please cure him’. The real one! I cured him. Gave self-realisation. Mother’s feet were broken. I kept him here on My feet for hours. After that, that real father-in-law disappeared and so did the mother-in-law. After that, they are never seen again. You are seen wandering alone sometimes. This should not be done. If you think that you have to bring him to Mother, get him cured, just as you think that you have to do good for him; you should also think that their ‘real’ (true) welfare will happen only when they are united with God. Their real welfare will be through this only. It is not that you just say superficially and the work is finished. One should feel it intrinsically, innately, and reflect on how much welfare (good) we have done for them. Was our work only superficially to cure their health and make them wrestlers? If for them, we think that we should help them (in a way) that it lasts till eternity or that we accept them, then did we really give them something really genuine or not? It is just like telling someone 'Come, we will give you diamonds and jewels’, and when they come, you hand them some fake things and say ‘go, go, go’. "We will enjoy the diamonds; you people stay seated". They should be called again and again. You people think how many people have you brought to Mataji for treatment, each one of you have brought! Are there not enough hospitals? Why do I need you people? I can go to the hospital to treat them. First you think ‘Mother, my so and so is ill, I should bring him’. So, you brought him. ‘Mother, this is her husband, he has gone mad’. Then, send him to the mental asylum. Why are you bothering me? So, you brought them all, fine. Alright, in what context did you do this? You felt great compassion for them. Alright, you felt compassion, and you did it. But now why has that compassion disappeared? Why didn't you think that we have not instilled it deeply within them? Today everyone should sit and ponder over this; and take a complete stock of how many people we have done this with. I’ve even observed that fathers come here, but the children don't. Tomorrow your children will roam around as hippies, then you will bring them saying ‘Mother, help them get rid of drugs’. I have seen many such people. When their children went astray, started doing this or stealing or fell sick, then they said ‘Mother, please cure him’. ‘Son, I have never seen his face. Whom have you brought’? And they are sitting here themselves because they have an ‘agency’. ‘We know Mataji- come on brother, let us introduce you to Her’. It is an agency. There is absolutely no infinity or depth in it. They have taken an agency. 'Mataji, we know Her very well. We will introduce your child to Her, come on.' There is no dearth of mad people. There is no shortage of diseases. Please do not gather sick people. But you have benefited the people you have brought here. Okay, this is also My heart. It’s fine, you bring them and tell them, ‘Go deeper, go deeper, go deeper’. You invite them to parties, to meals, you do this and that, and even serve them alcohol to make them happy. Sometimes one should also think about offering them the nectar of immortality. We should also share with them some of the Amrit (nectar) that we have received. Let this be the party that we will offer the Amrit. Just think about it, how joyful it is. What is the need to go to heaven? This very place can become heaven.

For some people it becomes a struggle; and for those who don’t have to struggle, they take it very easily. That is why for some people the struggle has to be created. Otherwise, they won't act (practice). The human brain (mind) is so upside down that even it also needs to be treated. First straighten out your brains (minds). Secondly, look at yourself with reverence and love; and with utmost respect look upon yourself that, if we are this immortal element, and if this eternal Chaitanya (consciousness) is flowing from within us, and this is indeed the reality, then what did we do with this higher life? What honour did we give to this being? What use did we make of it? Tomorrow God will ask you, ‘When you had received so much, then what did you do with it’? There is no lack in my hard work, right?  Or there is no lack in my love.
