1987-12-30 Evening Program, Kolhapur, India,

[After the performance ]Comment 1: You see, this is what you understand that this is how these people are describing themselves at we are musicians ..." Gondhari "are folk musicians ...We are the musicians for amba and they go to the villages and since a long time the villages they use to sing for the people describing how you should get your realisation so one realised soul would be going like that and he would tell how people are making money and deceiving you but what you have to get is your realisation. Then he would sing the song and then what you have seen that we are the musicians for the amba is the kundalini ...When they sing that Oh mother kundalini you arise! And then they say "Haan" You remember when it comes out you say "Haan" means it has reached the fontanel bone ie -it is pierced through. That's how it was done in the villages since long. And then waiting for this and as you have you know the meaning of the words Namdeva's Jogwas is that It describes completely how a realised soul is and what he gets ...So this is what he is describing since long in this country in the villages so as a whole we can say that they have already this background ...You see...Their attention is so much there. The attention is so correct...And so good that they are going in the villages and telling people that you have to get your realisation and also this is time to tell them that they should not be deceived by the people who are asking for money.The whole drama is played like that. And then by their dance, they tried to raise the kundalini of the people ...All of them.So they are singing the song that we are "Gondhar" ..."Gondhar" is also in the Marathi language means... a confused state so its a song with confusion because they accept that we are people... with our music is not that good or we are folk dance musicians but its a very respectable thing to be "Gondharis". And as you know the head of their company is the Mayor of Kolhapur so they are singing the song - of "Kalvir re se" place for the Kolhapur was called as "Kalvir" and amba was called as "kalvir niwasi " means the person who resides and its the Mahaxmi's temple. In the MahaLaxmi's temple they use to sing the song means in the Maha Laxmi's area what they are singing is the Sushumna Nadi ...is ...they are facing the Sushumna and saying that -Let the Kundalini rise up ...You see...This has been in this country, the villagers everywhere consciousness of faith, and that's how they spread it. So today is the time has come for all of them to get the realisation whatever they have done since ages now... in singing the song all over the world Many like these now they have got the realisation. May God bless them.[After one more performance ]Comment 2:Shri Mataji: In this song, they are singing that -Mother you are the compassion for all those who are suffering ...How long you are going to take to save me ...This is the song of a person who is saying that how long you are going to take to have compassion on me and to save me ...So sort of a little complaint ...that you are taking too much time to save something like that ...But it's a very beautiful song and song of a... I don't want anything I just want to be the worthy of your love ...to be worthy of your compassion...I don't want much I don't want anything but What I want is to be the worthy of your love, worthy of your attention and that's what it is ...

[After the performance ]Comment 3: This is the song written by our Damley from Bombay and this you can see...the subtler side of Sahaja Yogi describes in a.....He is saying that my meditation ("Dhyan" is the attention & has got the colour in Sahasrara)My attention has received colour in Sahasrara ...I become colourful at Sahasrara and he describes all the things ...Different stages When he comes in the Agnya he says that ...At Agnya many yogis came and ask the mother to come and to help them for their salvation. Many yogis and yoginis and all those lean down...And then the last he says that the Mother has [unclear 1:53:20 /self ] Now says - my child, you have to come far and then see me in person. The beautifully sung thing But what this gentleman has described also becomes very subtle I think, and he described it in a very subtle way and [Marathi ...1:53:39 ]In a very subtle way, he says that this mother is so loving and so kind, and her love ...Without her love what are we? Because of her, we have become so subtle and we can understand many things which we did not understand then he says ...At the end of it that the river of Ganges is ...It is the emotions of the Ganges is flowing in the sea of Chaitanya ...and he says that in 14 countries these gods have arrived bringing their devotion to pour into the ocean of Chaitanya ...You are all Gods ...He says that ...Wherever you go all the people who will meet you will become Gods ...He said that in our country some stupid people say there is no God ...They are all stupid people here you see how much mother has spread the great aura of God all over ...Its all over and one should come and see how mother has created Gods out of human beings that's what he is describing and he says that-The Mother is sitting in front of you, if you don't want to believe then we can't help you ...To say that there is no God is complete stupidity he says ...We have some intellectuals like that ...You never can betray ...especially in Maharashtra they are trying to give lecture saying that there is no God and this is all Humbug and all that. I would suggest that those who are feeling sleepy must clap more because their sleeping s will go away. It doesn't look nice ...Some people are just dosing off. So you better clap or you can go back and sleep formally ...Look at me I am sitting and listening Why are you feeling so sleepy What's the problem? Their attention will enjoy it ...1:56:16Sahaja yogi: (In Marathi ...)Shri Mataji: He says that whether you call it Rahim whether you call it Ram or you call it Yeshu ...All religion is the same. God is the same and the ultimate meaning of every religion is the same Parmarth...is the same So in his poem he has composed ...He has put all these 3 religions together to describe how they are one ...(After Performance of artists present on stage ...)Shri Mataji:2:06:50 In this they have tried to show the one Hindu gentleman singing the song of ...I mean the bhajan he is singing ...and the Muslim is getting disturbed because he is doing his namaz and they are fighting then the Christian is reading his bible and he is disturbed by both of them and he says that If you do like this I can't read and there is a big fight going on between the 3 of them and he says that my god is correct Another says my God is correct ...Three of them are fighting. Then the fourth man comes in and he says that God is described by all the great people and in the same manner the " Swaroopa " is the same. We only in our ignorance are fighting so let's have the light within us so in the light you can see that they are just the same & there is nothing in only in the bhajan or in the namaz, or in just reading about God ...It is what you have to find and its a very enlightening song I feel very good ...The most interesting part of it which really makes me quite enamoured by them is that this is the folk people ...They go to the villages and they sing these songs and try to remove the ignorance of the people has been going from so many years and this kind of effort has been there ...These are all the volunteers ...Just they volunteer and go round and do this job in the villages ...with the places keep night ...day time they work in the night they sing ...here you all are sleeping I am surprised because you see these people have been working the whole day and now singing the song ...This is how they go to villages. There are singing the songs in different villages entertain the villagers and also convey the message of Sahaja in the way that all religions are the same, one should not fight among themselves, and that you have to achieve your realisation all these very difficult things are sung in simple words and communicated ...And they sing the whole night from villages to villages ...They come back to cities work there and again go back or they gather for the villages ...The whole day they work in the night they sing by that they spread the news that one has to understand God in a subtler way. This is something which is remarkable about them... The way they work it out and that' how you will be surprised that we have 8000 people in Sangamnair and 10000 people in Akola and all of them got realisation. All of them!It took only 5 minutes for me for only 5 minutes ...In both the place ...Just in 5 minutes, they all got their realisation ...This is the great work they have done on their own level ...Nobody knows their names Who people are these ...Who are been going round in the villages and telling them the truth there must be a people who are realised souls who did all this job ...For us and that's how we get the response today ...I would say they sowed the seed which has difficulty They were hard-working villagers working for their fields the whole day and then in the evening they sit down and sing those songs. In the villages there are no other entertainments ...they enjoy this ...Even I have seen When I am ...I mean... my house being built, all the workers there in the night sit down and sing-song beautifully and compose the song and now they have got realisation so they are singing very subtle songs ...And composing the songs and working it out, Spreading to other workers around and to the villages around and they are thinking of going down in other villages to sing to them, to convey the message. So you have to be a little bit alert about it ...I think ...One has to see that this music can carry the message and once in a while, you should be able to do it properly so too much sleepiness is I don't understand ...Too much sleepiness is no need because such a song is going on... In that whole movement, sleep should disappear. But something you don't understand the language but see the effort of it ...See the effort of these people ...There are no loudspeakers anything no way of going to any place ...they use to walk down all the way to all the villages in the night and then sing there the whole night and walk back to their own places for their work. So this is the great work they have done for us and I am thankful to them and you all should be thankful for them ...This is what these people are doing now ...They are doing ...So give them a hand ...(the Marathi language is used by mother for some time )Gods work it is ...Gods work you have to do! Then you will be very alert as they are !and they get up at 5 o'clock in the morning, have their baths, again busy with their work ...But this is in Gods service they are doing ...With that feeling, with that joy. We can do it. You will not feel tired. If you know that it is in gods praise you are sitting here, You won't feel tired at all ...2:14:38[After the performance of the Sahaja yogis in stage ]Shri Mataji: 2:18:48 Hello, This is another very sweet song... you see ...They have composed it. That how can we describe the grace and compassion of Nirmala Mataji. That while describing it our throats are getting choked with feelings that's how there is in the description ...They are giving now about their feelings of Sahaja Yoga ...I would say that you try to shake your body little bit the way they shake...This is good for your Kundalini to rise because I am saying the little shaking is needed ...But at the wrong time, you shake your body is that not at the right time that' s what I feel.I am working on all of you ...Sitting down here ...And please don't sleep. Hear me what's the matter...these English bhoots are [unclear] ...You and also you Philip please get up now! Get up! Get up now! Get up!Haan Lets see! Be alert! I am with you! What is there?No, I am not just listening ...I am also working it out. Come along. Hun...(Marathi)They want to listen Powada afterwards... they want to sing 2 songs ...They want to hear your "Powada" ...But don't feel sleepy otherwise it will look like a doll some sort of a [unclear 2:22:02 ]. And not a "powada"(After Performance ...)Shri Mataji: Hello, this song ...this is all composed by them beautifully very subtle song but he says that you go on working and take the name of mother ...Only saying the name and her qualities and you can do the work that means you don't have to get out of work or get out of your normal life but then he says that because of the Sahaja yoga now we have become detached we have no attachment to things so whatever work we do we enjoy and not only that we never get tired ...Then he says the second point...that it is such a great thing that mother has given us is a simple method of Sahaja yoga by which we can have a Sahaja meditation and we can sustain that within ourselves ...This all poetry is made by these Gentleman...We are all children surrendered to mother and she is the one who is our protector, She is the one who is our guide. In all the directions it is resounding the great name of our mother. The universal song of the mother is resounding in the whole world ...Can you get him there ? just to play the "powada".Come along![Performance by other Sahaja yogis]2:37:13Shri Mataji:He is praising you all saying that you have all come to Kolhapur where there is the place of Mahalaxmi and this is a special place where these people have come all the way and praising the Adi shakti. Its a miracle, that they know it so well ...But he says that it is all our mother's powers that have brought this forth otherwise it's very difficult for all these nations to sing the praise of Adi shakti in Marathi language and we are very proud and we must all take a lesson from them ...How they have managed to learn these songs so well.All praise for you ...There is one thing about the [unclear/name/way ] we are collecting money they use it for going in the villages and doing this work ...So whatever you have contributed they are thankful for their work ...[After the performance ......]3:11:25Shri Mataji : (In Marathi ...)Mother gave presents to them...Sahaja yogi : (In Marathi...)(Other Sahaja Yogi in Marathi ...)Shri Mataji:Now they want to thank you very much.And they said that the way you have listened to our music which was not such a perfect, had lots of defects in it, We have done lots of mistakes so you should forgive us and they are saying that they are amazed that how you are concentration and attention is so good ...That you listen to us so well and that we have to learn from you how to be fully concentrated and to listen to the music which is the language to which you don't understand still you were listening so attentively and enjoying the vibrations from it and it is remarkable he says that the way you all have achieved such a height in your ascent ...So they said we touch your feet and also instead of you learning from us We have to learn from you a lot ...And you have to give us all the assistance to be one ...And then they said that we are here in Kolhapur We will always try to do whatever is possible and every year when you are going you inform us we will have a music program here, We can have a public program, and in the surrounding area, we will be spreading Sahaja yoga as well ...And we will be singing the song of Sahaja yoga ...And all which is possible for us we will try to do but according to them you are at a very high level of realisation And they have to learn really a lot from you. And they are again and again very thankful to you. For listening to their music whatever way it was, a very simple folk song, a very simple folk style of music ... Not so perfect ...So they are thankful to you for that again and again ...
