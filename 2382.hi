New Year's Eve Puja, Kalwe (India), 31 December 2001.

I’m telling them that how a Sahaja Yogi should feel.  You should be satisfied people.  Firstly and foremost you have to be satisfied.  You just see within yourself if you are satisfied or not.  You’ve got the highest that you wanted, you have got the peace, you’ve got the joy, and all the blessings of the Divine.  Despite that, if you are dissatisfied, you want to do something always that is disturbing.  Always some people want to show Me off, want to come forward – or they want to escape Sahaja Yoga.

Firstly, you must spread Sahaja Yoga.  How many people have you brought to Sahaja Yoga?  Just think of it!  We are Sahaja Yogis – Sahaja Yogis means what?  You are saints!  In this world all the saints who became saints, with very great difficulty, going through lots of tortures, have done so much work.  One single saint has so many people whom they have attracted.  Of course he couldn’t give them Realisation, because I have taught you how to do that.  But you just find out what are you doing about Sahaja Yoga.

Only meditation is not the point.  Meditation for what?  For equipping yourself to help others; we need it very much in this Kali Yuga, people who will go all out to help.  On the contrary, I find that they are very anxious just to meet Me, to see Me.  I have seen all the Indians who come to Cabella must  meet Me, must see Me, as if they have a special right with Me.  What is the need?  What is the need to meet Me?  But this is the trouble of, say, our conditioning, that supposing there is some leader, some Minister coming, everybody will go and show off, like to meet him and talk to him – but not a Sahaja Yogi.

You must have self-esteem.  Self-esteem by which you should know what is your dignity and how you should be.  There are Sahaja Yogis who are excellent, who are very good, who are very self satisfied – I know who they are.  And you have to be like that, otherwise you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga, you are like all other people trying to hinder into all nonsensical activities. Now this is it.

Today’s was a real test, because I just couldn’t come earlier.  You know what is the traffic nowadays, I just couldn’t arrive; and still you were sitting here – this gives me great satisfaction.  That they really love Me, and they are really Sahaja Yogis.

If you really love Me you must love others who are not Sahaja Yogis and try to give them Realisation.  Because you know My age is quite a lot, and how far can I go?  I am not going now to many countries, but Sahaja Yoga is growing fast, though I am not going there.  It is growing – why?  Because people of that country understand their responsibility.  You should know what is your responsibility – it is not only towards yourself but it is for the rest of the world, (that) you have to work it out and do something about it.  Whatever people you can approach, or whatever people you can meet, go all out!

I have also said before, I have seen people who go to some horrible gurus go on talking about their guru, describing their guru.  Anybody who meets them, they go on telling them.  Not Sahaja Yogis.  I don’t know, maybe they want to preserve their Realisation.  They think if they tell somebody their Realisation will drop out.  If you don’t spread Sahaja Yoga, what is the use of getting your Realisation?  All my labour is wasted on such people, who are for themselves.  They want something for themselves.

Now for example, so many girls wanted to marry.  There are four times more, five times more than all the boys put together.  But if they are not married, they feel very unhappy about it.  Doesn’t matter!  You are now connected to God!  Marriage is not always a very great blessing, I tell you, it’s not.  On the contrary, it can be very binding, it could be very troublesome.  So better not feel bad.  You should feel bad when you cannot give Realisations to others.
How many people have I given Realisation?  Just think about it.  All the time, like all the ordinary people, thinking about marriage, and this and that.  It’s not going to help you.  You are something special.  And what speciality do you have?  What are you doing about it?

I’m sorry at the end of this, our great Ganapatipule, I have to tell you this.  But sometimes one has to tell, also.  I know you are all, all very good Sahaja Yogis.  Also that you have achieved so much.  But what is My desire is, that all of you should become like a light and start spreading Sahaja Yoga.  In some countries it has happened, it is working out, and people feel so responsible.  I am amazed at them, how they are spreading Sahaja Yoga.
Now the same request I have to make to you.  That please look at yourself, introspect, what have you done?  What have you achieved in Sahaja Yoga?  Such a satisfaction lies when you really, when you really work hard to spread Sahaja Yoga.

Many people think that coming nearer Me I feel pleased – I am not.  That’s no recognition.  You should never do that.  On the contrary, when you will grow really, I will know, Myself.
Today is not the day I should have said all this, because it is the day for New Year’s Day.  But only good decisions are to be taken on the New Year’s Day – that’s the custom with human beings.  So today you all have to take the decision that ‘What are we doing for Sahaja Yoga?’  ‘What are we giving Sahaja Yoga?’  ‘What is our achievement?’  ‘Are we sharing with others?’

It’s the greatest Truth you have got.  Nobody got it – people worked so hard, did so much – nobody could give Realisation!  It’s only you can give Realisation, it’s very surprising.  Kabir could not give Realisation to anybody.  Gyanadeva could not give Realisation to anybody.  All of them have been great, great Saints of great value system and with great understanding.  Whatever poetry they have given, people are singing – that’s all.
But, they cannot give Self Realisation which you can do.  With all that power, if you are not giving Realisation, what’s the use of giving power to someone like that?

So today’s New Year’s message is that ‘Next year you must give Self Realisation to many people.   (To) How many people have you given Realisation?’.  That’s the main thing.  Just find out.  What have you done throughout the year?  I don’t know how to count it.  But you, yourself count.  ‘What have we done all these years?’  ‘What have we achieved?’
Attending My Puja is no favour to Me.  Or doing anything for the Puja is no favour to Me.  My greatest Puja is that of human beings; and if you can achieve and spread Sahaja Yoga that fast, I’ll be very, very grateful to you.
I have worked very hard, I have really worked very hard.  This Body, this Mind, all My Health, everything, I have done for saving people.  And you please also tonight decide and take a view that what Mother is saying is very important and precious.  We have to, we have to rise and give Realisation to people.  But which is not so common – I am surprised why people are behaving in this manner who are Realised Souls.

All my blessings for the New Year, for all of you ‘Happy New Year’!  But – next year should be full of many Sahaja Yogis who have done work and who have achieved something great.

May God bless you
