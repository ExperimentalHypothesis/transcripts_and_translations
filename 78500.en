Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

Shri Mataji: They can come in front, here.

[UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji:There still people down?

Yogi: Yes, only.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] here? Ah, yes. What is it?

Yogi: I'm just gonna stick a microphone here, just in case you decided to talk.

Shri Mataji: All right. It's quite personal though, I'm going to talk, huh? So we can do it later.

Yogi: Okay.

Shri Mataji: So we are here for North America, we can call it, easier is North America and we have now ashrams in all these places. All these places.

If you move forward he can sit.

[Yogis shuffling forward]

You must have heard about the eastern block people and [UNCLEAR] states that in Lithuania there was eight thousand people and I was not there. What a [UNCLEAR]? So they were Sahaja yogis like you only. They went out and got a eight thousand people. So, I think it is, this a land is not spontan that's all. And one has to work very hard. But I'm a -feeling this year in a new... New Year because it is said that after 1990, Sahaja yoga will spread, very fast. But not in America, it isn't stable.

So now, however, if I should be spread Sahaja yoga, to smaller places near your, say, near Boston now? Maybe in the Boston city, the city it would not be so successful. We've tried quite a lot in Boston city, you know that. But the real radiance to Boston you can find, where you can go round a talk to people and find out. Maybe you might be able to get, near Boston city, certainly. And also they have got which is quite suspiring how it is prospered there also. So if it has just prospered there that means then can't [UNCLEAR], that's side. Also I felt that [UNCLEAR] and [UNCLEAR Florida] is also very far there. Oh course I mean, we aren't getting thousands but you get good Sahaja yogis. But Boston I felt is a educational thing, people come for education and more sort of intellectual type of people. But if you can go a little bit beyond, Boston, you'll find people who will be very good. Like they also tried in [UNCLEAR] and they found these very good in [UNCLEAR], they started working in [UNCLEAR]. So we have to get out of such places which we find not so good.

Like even New York, I mean so far, let's see tomorrow what happens. A great hope from Chinese because they are very wise people and maybe I'll be speaking to the other black community also here. Maybe it might work out with that. But is best is to think there we can go a little away from the city. Where we have not been so good because city people just want some sort of a payment and they finished, that's all. They don't want to become something. So for them they will do all right that they can face many [UNCLEAR] they have to do, you see. As they have somebody, a psychiatrist attached to them, they have a guru so they don't want to have somebody who will really do something.

But we have to get as many people as possible in America, that's important and that will help us all. And we have to work it out that we get more people and spit it out, wherever it is possible, that should be the case. So I've also said Phoenix would be a good idea because I have felt the vibrations and [UNCLEAR they are very nice]. In Canada we are working out very in Vancouver but not so much in Toronto because the Indians are quite troublesome. [UNCLEAR] satisfying them is difficult to work it out there. So that's why you are there, [UNCLEAR] you have to see that the Indians have some brains to try to talk to them and tell them that they have to behave yourself. Otherwise the Eastern block will take over the whole world I think. The way they are - imagine the 8000 people. These French people who are there and 8000 people came to the programs of the Sahaja Yogis.

So now Ivan says he has a problem, he thinks he's rather strict and he doesn't want to be very strict with you, he was telling me. But unless and until you have your own self -discipline, somebody has to discipline you. Once you have your own discipline, there's no need to discipline you at all. But certain disciplining has to be done otherwise, Sahaja Yoga will not grow. As it is, American life is such, I mean, every moment is frittered, I mean. Every moment is frittered, I mean, nobody thinks, what is the value of this time and what time we are born, how important. Even Sahaja Yogis sometimes. So it is important that we should have a little strictness about it, one shouldn't mind because is disciplines you. And then once the self-discipline is established, then you are all right. So I do not like to have complaints against people who are discipling and complaining, shouldn't mind it. But gradually then you will find it can help you if you take to the discipline. And those who are disciplining if they go too further, they also know that it's not good. But they have to be cautious about it and that the growth within can only be possible through self-discipline otherwise it will not be possible. You may have thousands of people around you, you might have lot of people you are willing to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga, but inside you'll be all anything, so what's the use? So you have to develop yourself within, and there I find the people in the west are very sort of ego oriented. They think they are perfectly all right nothing wrong with them. Everything is wrong with others, nothing wrong with them, they don't need any correction. They don't have to be meditating or doing anything. Only they can give lectures to others and put them right, they can please kundalini. But Sahaja Yoga is very easy to know, also you get your realisation. You don't have to go to school or anything, you don't have to study, you know Sahaja Yoga. But once you have this kind of an attitude that we are spreading Sahaja Yoga, and we are great Sahaja Yogis and Nirmal lights. But the Nirmal lights have to have lights within. So he, what I always talk about, the horizontal and the vertical, if you have horizontal movement that you are spreading Sahaja Yoga, so must also [UNCLEAR], it should be balanced. Otherwise, you spread all Sahaja Yoga everywhere and you will be left with none. That should not be said. So everybody has to meditate morning til evening. During mediation only you go. Please remember that. When you are thoughtlessly aware, then only you will go. When there are thoughts you cannot. That state has to be improved, increased and maintained. Then in that thoughtless awareness only you will know, is a fact. So if we have to grow, we are not in Sahaja Yoga just because we are coming together or just because it is a fashion or just because you think you are seeking something and that's a nice collectivity, there's lots of people. It is what you are within, it's what you have got. And once you reach a certain state, you see. Then you don't need any self discipline because you get self disciplined, itself. Like we have [UNCLEAR] Shudy camps, who works very hard. She's always relaxed, [UNCLEAR]...who always stands, you see. So I asked her, ''How are you relaxed? And he is not?''. She said ''Because Mother, he thinks too much about. I only know one thing that everything that I've put at the lotus feet of Mother. Whenever I start, anything. I am doing nothing, She is doing everything so why should I not witness''.

But that is a state one has to achieve. That everything at the lotus feet of Mother that state if you can achieve, it's a state. Again I'll say it's a state! It's not something mental but just - maybe tomorrow and try, you'll feel very much light first of all. I think will be [UNCLEAR]. But it is all the time forgotten, even people forget there vibrations. They forget to give bandha’s. Now some you are very senior Sahaja yogis, you have to all the time use your vibrations for everything. And then you will be quite gently with it and you will know, in the security of it.

Now we have here most of the leaders, except for Bhala is not here, I wish he was here so I could have gone to him. But in any case all places are doing well compared to that what we were, I should say. But we can do much more. By surrendering everything, if you can surrender well, you can do that.

Please keep your eyes open when I am talking, you should keep your eyes open.

So now if you have any practical explaining, you must tell be now. I would like to talk.

Nikki: I have a very hard time being thoughtless, and I can say I sit down in the morning and I've been trying to get up at 4 because it seems easier to be thoughtless than what, is there anything I can...

Shri Mataji: I can't hear a single word.

Nikki: I have a difficult time being thoughtless.

Yogi: Nikki, she has a difficult time being thoughtless and she tries to get up at 4 in the morning because that seems to be the best time to meditate, but she has a hard time being thoughtless in her meditation.

Nikki: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Why?

Nikki: I don't know why... perhaps I'm just so right -sided or...

Shri Mataji: Treat it and it will work out, that's one. They put your left to the right, all right, and then any thought that comes in you should say, I forgive, I forgive, you can visualise. All right? Then you can work. The right hand towards the photograph and left hand you have the ice, put it on your liver and both the feet in the water. And that could work out. All right?

Nikki: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: Any other problems?

Yogi: Mother, for spreading Sahaja Yoga, can we go to the church area?

Yogi: For spreading Sahaja Yoga, can we go to the church area?

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR want to give up?] If you want but they won't listen. But you can have [UNCLEAR]. What is this so-called Christianity done for us? Put it like that. It has just given us [UNCLEAR] paying money to them, that's all. It's a money oriented thing, they are not going down to the spirit. And you have to do what Christ has said ''Is to be born again'', like realisation and if you want that thing to be [UNCLEAR] of peace, come and see us. And such and such point. This is all talk, talk, talk, there's no actualisation of baptism. If you can give such boundaries to the people who go to the church, they might turn up. It doesn't give benevolence, it doesn't give you any calmness, it doesn't give you any compassion. Because the behaviour of Christians have been spreading Christianity is horrible. So there's something gone wrong and what is it? Like that you can write something and write parts about the little pamphlets or something or ready and hand to the people. You give your addresses, you can come and he will answer you all these questions if you are... or when you are going to hold a public program, you can put these things out and ask them to come and see it, in the program will tell you what is it.

Because these christians always try and come to disturb our programs. I think they are all paid for the ones who would sort of. This time is happened again and we were in a...? What is that place called?

[Inaudible - Yogis and Shri Mataji discussing]

...You see we have taken everything, the hall and all that and these people just came in and started some sort [UNCLEAR]. But in the church, when people are going to the church can do that. I mean coming out of the church can do that. But if you go to the church, out of question. To them everything is Hindu and Christianity is the last word of evolution according to them. What these horrible Christians have done, [UNCLEAR is just the fall or the steam]. What would they have given [UNCLEAR]. In England for example, there is only one religion, that is Church of England, even other Christians are not regarded as a religion, only Church of England. That is absolutely absurd.

They are also money oriented but people can be brought in, you see with churches are really money oriented but they can be brought in the pool of Sahaja Yoga. But they are not such fundamentalists those who go to church, they are just a social thing on sunday, all right. Just go to church and come back, finished. You might find some people here. But in the university and all that you can try in Boston. Have you tried in [UNCLEAR]?

Yogi: We tried Shri Mataji but not very hard.

Shri Mataji: Not much.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, one hour outside of Boston near Worcester, where [UNCLEAR] lives. They have a lot of success there.

Shri Mataji: Really? That's outside Boston.

Yogi: Outside, one hour outside Boston.

Shri Mataji: Outside that's better. And the students also come tomorrow all over the world and spend so much money to study here and they are busy study, they have no time for all that. So it's better to try people outside. Sometimes I always think that we have not touched the people, the people to be Sahaja Yogis. So far in that in area we have not touched, we have a few people now here, who are Sahaja Yogis. We have not touched that big areas. I have a feeling they must be some areas which we can crack but I don't know when we are going to touch. But look at the East block, we're touching. Only one lecture, one lecture in that yoga seminar, about 35 minutes and 10 minutes for the realisation and they all realised. And here we have to talk, talk, talk years together, I mean to get in your heads. So of course I test your vertical thing you should work out, every day. Plus try to spread it out, I think it might work out. My blessings can.

I went to Russia and it was a tremendous success that i felt my Indian, Australia and Russia. After all you are human beings [UNCLEAR]... allow Russians to go to wherever.[UNCLEAR] Eastern block people I think, they way they have recognise us. They are born [UNCLEAR]. Even this Chinese from [UNCLEAR] mainland China, they have tremendous respect for Me. You see I went there, the minister told My husband, ''Please bring your Wife also to the office''. No, never a wife goes to the office. So I arrive there and they talked to Me, they were nice. They ask Me what, I think they know what I am doing. And also once they had an exhibition in London and they had invite both of us but I didn't go. So they specially extended that exhibition for one day, for Me. And they said She must come and see show. So I think there is something they know about. They are sensitive people [UNCLEAR]. Also we think the...students maybe too much like that you see. They should have got a proper way of saying how they want democracy and all that. You can say give us democracy just now! They'll see that, that's not the way. How can you have democracy which is like that. So that is the reason, [UNCLEAR] I mean we could have just [UNCLEAR] some people would be much better than to have subtler. And talk to them, the ones you mean by democracy. But you want to have, how can we have? There they fail, their intelligence fail and their wisdom fail, like that.

For two days back, you see, I've felt it was for one year. When this [UNCLEAR] took place. It's just an error on the first time. Otherwise, I think you have very wise people, because I've been to China three times, two times, and I think you have very, good wise people. In some feats, they beat even Indians, really. Very wise, sensible, very humble people. Also, every way, see the good they've done. No, no, no we are still learning, we have to learn such a lot more. Now, what about Taiwan? I'm planning for Taiwan, how long?

Yogi: Yes, September, we are going.

Shri Mataji: No. It's already, somebody there, has gone. You contact him.

Yogi: [UNCLEAR] is in Taiwan right now...

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

Yogi:...and he has been in contact with the [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: But you can wish to write to him and find out what the situation like?

Yogi: He doesn't have a...

Shri Mataji: We have an address.

Yogi: Address, yes.

Yogini: Yes, we do. His written, you know [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: He has his address, you write to him. But then I was so surprised, I get this time to see before, and at this airport, there were about 35 Chinese Sahaja Yogis from Malaysia. I was surprised to see them, I mean. In this year, they have done so much work in Malaysia, so I said I'm also said I will go to Malaysia from [UNCLEAR]. Otherwise, I was not going to Malaysia for the last few years. So there, I told them to try more and more, the Chinese and that area. Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan. Because Indians are noble. Once they are out of their country, they are absolutely finished. So don't pay any attention to Indians. Just don't bother. Have nothing to do with them, it's very difficult to [UNCLEAR] with them. We like those about ten or twelve of them there, from British liner, these Indians. All, everybody got realisation except for these. And your colleagues have decided, baba, these, that, and horrible. None of them got the realisation, serious thing, yes. [UNCLEAR Got a glasses]. And also you must pray for spiritual people and give them bandha’s, praying even helps a lot.

You must pray that America should be saved. Has been very difficult, has it not? I mean, we have about 120 people in Sahaja Yogis, in the whole of America. Which we can call as Sahaja's Yogis. Can you imagine? It's very sad. But we will test that area, I'm sure we will test that area. And all the funny false gurus are here, all of them. And those who are not there, are trying to come, even now. And they don't like Me at all because they think I am the one who is just taking out their [UNCLEAR leaders] or something like that. But your response will be doing in India also. India will get lots of people, but there will be about 12,000 people. Only about 13,000, 14,000. And also another place was Noida. They have about 15,000 people. It's quite nice, yes. Everywhere we have in thousands, wherever we go. Even in the two years, you have seen how many people there are in many places, so many people. Even in a small, little village, there are so many people. All the other countries, like Austria, we have much better response. Then Italy is, of course very good, Italy is very good. France, France, so many Sahaja Yogis, so... At least one thousand five hundred, six hundred Sahaja Yogis. It's so nice to see them. It's so beautiful. And also Germany is doing very, very well now. Germany, Switzerland, yeah.

Yogi: There was Swiss... A program in East Berlin.

Shri Mataji: Where?

Yogi: They made a program in East Berlin, first public program in East Berlin.

Shri Mataji: How many came?

Yogi: One hundred fifty people came...

Shri Mataji: You see.

Yogi: ...and thirty five signed for the follow up.

Shri Mataji: Stayed on.

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: See now. And it is America's slow because all those gurus are there and all kinds of things. But I am sure now it will work out. For the first time, a newspaper has [UNCLEAR]... one is Chinese and one is English and then again your program. First time! In New York. We tried everything. We spent a lot of money on it, a lot! We went to Los Angeles and then we paid a lot of money. We went to the one who was supposed to be our P.R.O and then so many programs with the television this, that. It's all waste.

San Diego was good, this time quite good. Let us see how many come. Because when I go there, then of course there will be lots of people. If I don't know what happens to them when I go away, then never bother. They are doing another guru shop, going to another guru to listen to him. From one guru to another guru. I gave a very nice lecture in San Diego and that thing must be taken and you must, you should take these people, listen to that, it's a very nice thing, which, compare them, compare them to [UNCLEAR]. He has got the tape and he must get that tape done as soon as possible, send it to all the centers and they can use it.

So now, I leave it to you, to work it out. I am again coming to Canada of course, going to go to Canada. And then I mean I have to go to San Diego for a reason. I mean I am just around here, then I have to go to South Americas. South America is great! Really, very clear.

[INAUDIBLE Yogi talking to Shri Mataji]

Shri Mataji: He says if you come and stay here for two, three months it will be all right. I think so, we can do that. But [UNCLEAR] so. First, try yourselves. Just now I don't think that I can do it all. Frivolous, very frivolous. Once they've touched their depth, then they're all right but if [UNCLEAR some experience] before they touch their depths. I mean, with that negativity they get lost. The point, that's a dangerous time. So how are you otherwise? [UNCLEAR] your all right?

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: It looks like nice... Belgium is another headache, I'll tell you. I'll wait if you come to Belgium, let's see. That trip from France has given up, it [UNCLEAR] them. They [UNCLEAR] my car. Now, Paul and... you see, he's doing well, Renee. Doesn't go on, but...

Yogi: Henno?

Shri Mataji: Henno.

Yogi: Henno.

Shri Mataji: Huh? Who's that?

Yogi: Henno.

Shri Mataji: Henno, Henno. Henno is a, he's doing well, but he has an Angya problem.

Let's see. He still has Angya. It feels better than the other one. So it's, it's working out. But how many times are you there? Only there are three countries have not been, Norway, Belgium... Norway, Denmark, Sweden, these three countries I have not been. Otherwise I've been to all the other countries in your finger.

All right, we're done, thank you very much. Now pray for this program that many people come, for this program that we are having, and for the follow on. You have to pray that's the only way because your desires are always fulfilled.
