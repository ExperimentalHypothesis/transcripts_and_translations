Public Program, Day 1, Madrid, Spain 18-05-1989

[Talk of Shri Mataji starts after 00:00:12]

I apologise for being late because I was held up in a very great crowds there, I don’t know because it was so unprecedented. Now as we talk of truth, we have to be very honest about it. If you see, in our seeking, whatever we see may not be the truth. For example many people believe in certain ideologies and some believe in certain religions, certain faiths. Some believe in certain political theories and some believe in some psychological theories too but we have to know that truth cannot be through our mental projections. If it were so, we would have all thought the same thing. Whatever one may follow or believe or have faith  their all are capable of doing anything that is sinful.

So everyone has to know that if we have to know the truth it has to be one. It cannot be many. So very humbly we should accept that so far we are not connected with the truth. Now when I’m talking to about truth also you may not believe me blindly but should have an open mind like a scientist . If you put forward before you a hypothesis and if it is true then as honest people we have to accept. Already it has been explained, I am sure, about this subtle system that exists within us.Whatever religion you may follow, whatever faiths you may follow, whatever ideology you live with, this system exists within us.

So Sahaja means ‘Sa’ means ‘with’ and ‘Ja’ is ‘born with you’. Yoga, means ‘union with the Divine’. So the right to be ‘united’ to the Divine or the ‘Divine power’ which is ‘all-pervading’, is  belonging to all of you. And this Divine power exists that we know but we are not yet aware of it. This is the divine power that does all the living work. The seed becomes a tree. The tree has the flowers and the flowers become the fruit and how does it happen? How a seed becomes a fruit? So there is some power which is working it out in a very precise manner.

Now, you see a flower of a rose flower comes out of underneath the rose bush or an orange comes out of an orange tree. What a choice?. If Spanish is born to a Spanish.. But inside ourselves we are all having this system built-in.And above which even in modern times, Yung, one of the great psychiatrist has talked about them. Christ has said that, ‘you are to be born again’. But that doesn’t mean you put a label on your head saying I am born again and think you are great. It is a living process of a living energy which gives you that second birth and one should not accept something artificial. Because that can never give us, whatever  is promised in all the scriptures.All the scriptures all over the world have said one thing in common. That is we have to seek the eternal and [UNCLEAR] to be enjoyed in their own limitations. According to different tongues it was preached differently. In modern times now we only have to talked about self realisationso that we achieve our self realisation. According to Indian mythology this is Kalyuga means the bad Days, very bad days. But built in within it is a [UNCLEAR] Yoga where this will happen, happening [UNCLEAR things]

So today thousands of people are getting their self realisation. Sahaja yoga is working in thirty five nations. It is a living process and you can’t pay for it. If you have to sow a seed, how much do we pay to the seed or to the Mother Earth? Both of them do not understand money. So one has to know one thing you can not pay for any living process. And we should not be deluded by big advertisements and big things because once you - they get money these false people can advertise.

One has to only think of one’s self realisation and one must get that ‘special awareness’ which is called as ‘Collective Consciousness’. There the microcosm becomes the macrocosm and you can feel it on your fingertips the all-pervading power. Not only that but you can feel your own system and your own problems say and you can feel on others on your fingertips. Mohamed Saheb has said that at the time of resurrection your hands will speak and they will give witness against you. So this is a ‘Happening’ that has to take place. Every human being can get it. Some get it very fast and some get it little late because could be some obstructions in those centres subtle centres within us. But it can be cleared out. You have to  have patience with yourself.

Now the time has come for you to know your own growth. I will give you an example of Television. When we take it to the village in India they and told that you can see all kinds of beautiful pictures. They can’t believe it. They think it’s just a box of plastic but when it is put to the mains then they are amazed. In the same way you are put to the mains and you start acting like an absolute computer.You can know about yourself. You can know about others, you can know everything you want to know. Some people are so frustrated in life so disappointed they think that there is nothing like Divine.That is not rue. Even the science can be foretold without even knowing science with Sahaja Yoga. So many such things have happened and the people who have got realisation have got rid of their incurable diseases. Their mental problems have been solved and they live in a life of joy. Joy which is not a thing like happiness and unhappiness. It is single. Today I was coming by plane and I saw people in the plane who were very tense and very unhappy. nd somebody told me that he is just waiting for his death now. So this is the situation because we do not know that there is more for our life.

We have come from amoeba stage to become something more. I hope today it works out with you all and I was not coming to Madrid because in Madrid we found people were not taking to Sahaja Yoga that much. But Barcelona was much better. But this time Rosa and [UNCLEAR]said Mother, ‘this time again Mother please try Madrid’ and I think it has worked that you all are here. But I have to make a request, even if you get your realisation you have to maintain it. For that you have to come to our collective programs. Only once a week you don’t have to pay but give little time thats all to yourself and that will make you the masters. I hope it is going to work out today for all of you.

May God bless you.

Last time there were so many questions in Madrid. I did not know what they were talking about. But it’s still better you ask me questions. Otherwise while you are getting realisation you will think why we did not ask these questions, you see. By asking questions or by answering or by reading books by these webs of words you do not get realisation. It has to work out. May God bless you all.

Question and answer session with the audience.

Sahaja yogi: She says something like can you explain the relationship between your hands and the chakras? The relationship between the fingers and the chakras? That is what she wants to know.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Hello. Now the thing is I think you see, you come in this room and when  you want to become the light you just switch on everything comes because [UNCLEAR you change it]. Now if I start telling you all about the electricities, histories everything it’s a headache, you see. Better have the light on and then you will know each and everything, I promise you.

Sahaja yogi: He says what you mean by collective consciousness? Is it like an image of God , is it like a sense of humanity?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. Again the same thing I can explain to him but as I said it he will know it all about  but I can tell you now if he wants to know. You see, it is ‘the all-pervading power’ which is doing all this living work, that is the one, first time you start feeling on your fingertips. In modern times one should not start talking about God because [UNCLEAR half would be]. Very dangerous.

First of all we must discover whether  it is so or not. It is experiment. If it is so then we can find out more. I will explain to you every thing. I promise you.

Sahaja yogi: Is it related to Sai Baba, is Sahaja Yoga related to Sai Baba?

Shri Mtaji: Which one? The one who is fixed on diamonds?

Shri Mataji: No, no, how can it be? It is nothing to do with diamonds. It is Shirdi Sai Nath, one who is the ‘Real’ one. It is related to all real people. But you will not come to know ‘real’ and ‘unreal’ until you get your self realisation.

Sahaja yogi: Explain to him to get your realisation how do you raise your kundali?How do you do it?

Shri Mataji: That I will do. Later on you can do also. Like one enlightened light can enlighten another light. When you will be enlightened, you can do it. He can do it.

Sahaja yogi: You spoke about conscience but if I recall consciensia in Italian, Latin probably is conscientia that means all our knowledge put together.

Shri Mataji: Yes true,yes, that’s what I mean.

Sahaja yogi: And that's what you mean?

Shri Mataji: That’s what I mean.

Sahaja yogi: Maybe that’s what this gentleman...

Shri Mataji: And I say thank you very much, thank you very much for saying that. Did you follow that now sir?

Shri Mataji: That was [UNCLEAR proper].

Sahaja yogi: I have one more question. Beside the subtle body, is it true that we have sixty four other levels like the [UNCLEAR...] Do we have sixty four levels?

Shri Mataji:No, we don’t have such levels as that but you see, if your attention moves to the side, left or right. There are seven layers on left side and seven on right side and then you do get possessed by this. So as I said that all this you will understand very well when you will be coming to the program. I am very happy to meet you. In any case you must join.

Seeker: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: Alright. So you will know all about it. The levels are, just now, first of all is to get your Self realisation. And then actually the movement now is upwards so the first stage when you cross this centre then you get what we call as ‘thoughtless awareness’. That means if you want you can think and if you don’t want, you don’t think, you are at peace. Then you cross over and pierce through here, on your Fontanelle bone. That is the actualisation of Baptism according to ChristianityI would say and you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head itself. Now you have another state where when you start establishing  your connection. Then the second stage, what we call as, doubtless awareness ‘Nirvikalpa Samadhi’. At that stage you become completely knowledgeable and you you live in joy. Now these are the two stages you have to achieve.

Sahaja yogi: He is asking if Sahaja Yoga can cure problems, mental problems. Can it cure people who take drugs?

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course.We have cured many people of drugs, of course. Oh there are, there are alcoholics, drug addicts, violent people, all that.

There is a doctor we have who was  an alcoholic and drug addict. We cured him and now he is incharge of seven hospitals in (UNCLEAR (Indian city)) . It also cures people who have been to wrong, false gurus and have been affected by them.

Sahaja yogi: He says that he works with drug people with drug problems. He said maybe he could...

Shri Mataji: You get all of them. We will put them right. Yes, it’s very simple. It's very simple. Actually in the West people are taking drugs also because they are seeking truthI don’t blame them.

Sahaja yogi: Last question. She belongs to this thing called UNCLEAR, I don’t know what it is, some organisation and they believe it is the age of Aquarius. And when did you come...

Shri Mataji: It is. It is the age of Aquarius. Aquarius is the Kundalini .The Kundalini that rests in the triangular bone is called as Kumbha. In Sanskrit language kumbha is in English language it is Aquarius. There are so many theories pointing out towards Sahaja Yog but still most  of them are in the air. They have not been able to find something substantial.

Now is it the last one?

Sahaja yogi: Is there any similarity, relationship between kundalini and Japanese word khi?

Shri Mataji: Yes, Tao. Have you heard about Tao?

Sahaja yogi: Whether the khi is a type of yoga?

Shri Mataji: Yes it is. But so far  they haven’t got many people realised.  I met the leader.  He told me that from the third century, there has been no kusyapas means realised souls. He was very honest I  would say. He came for curing himself so very honest.

Sahaja yogi: Shall we have the Realisation?

First and foremost thing is that we have to be pleasantly placed towards ourselves and we should not have any guilt in our mind, at all. After all only the human beings can make mistakes. God doesn’t make mistakes. So there should be no guilt of anything whatsoever. Forget the past at this moment. We have to think of the present .Now we have to understand that though it works spontaneously, we have to little bit help to our centres and I will tell you how to do it. First of all you have to take the help of the Mother earth so if you don’t mind you can take out your shoes without feeling offended.Please take out your shoes.

Second thing is you don’t have to tensed at all. Just stay comfortable.You have to be comfortable.

(Come here.)

It will hardly take fifthteen minutes but I will request you, do not have to get up halfway and walk out.

I will explain to you, what you have to do now with open eyes but then you have to close your eyes because your attention will be drawn inside. There will be no complications, you will not feel anything. Ultimately most of you will feel the cool breeze coming out from your head and also in your hands. So at the very outset I will request you for one more thing,  hat please forgive everyone. Without thinking, without counting mistakes, without counting people, just forgive everyone. Very important. After all when you say, I forgive, you don’t do anything .And then you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything, but when you don’t forgive then you play into the hands.

Now what we have to do is to just understand, that you have to place your left hand like this towards Me. The left side means the desire, the power of desire, that you have the desire to have your Self realisation. Now the right hand is to be used for releasing your centres because this is the power of action. You have to put both your feet apart from each other and when you close your eyes you can take out your spectacles also. Until I tell you please don’t open your eyes.

So now be pleasantly placed towards yourself. You have to love ourselves. Human beings are  the epitome of evolution. They are the highest in the universe and the whole creation of this world. The whole creation of God. So we have to love ourselves. May God bless you.

Now close your eyes before I tell you then afterwards  you close your eyes. Not just now, when I tell you to close them please close your eyes.. Now with the right hand, now you have to put left hand towards me and right hand on your heart because in the heart resides the Spirit. All of you should do it.

Second, we work only on the left side. So take this right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. So this is the centre of your mastery and that is how you should press your hand here. With your fingers press here, inside. Now, then you have to take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre which gives you all your central nervous system, gives you awareness and also you can work out the laws of the divine. So this is the centre of pure knowledge. Now again you raise your right hand in the upper part of the abdomen on the left hand side, please. Now raise your right hand on your heart again. Now your right hand goes between the shoulder and your neck like this from the front side, and turn your head to your right. Now this is the centre you catch when you feel guilty. But this is a very dangerous centre because it gives you also angina and other spinal cord trouble like spondylitis. So please, please do not feel guilty at all. Now for this right hand on your forehead, across. This is the centre of forgiveness. Bend your head. Now put this right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. This is the centre through which we ask for forgiveness but we do not feel guilty or count our mistakes. Now stretch your hand and put the centre of your palm on top of your Fontenelle bone area which was a soft bone. Now stretch your fingers outward and press it hard and now move your scalp very slowly clockwise seven times. Bend your head.

That's all we have to do. If you find your hands are very hot, because of this (Agnya). All right, it doesn’t matter.

Now put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart. Now close your eyes. Keep your left hand all the time towards Me and be comfortable. Now at this point you have to ask Me a very fundamental question, three times, ‘Mother am I the Spirit’? In your heart. In your heart,three times. Now you have to know that if you are the spirit, you are your master, your guide. Your spirit will guide you.

So now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now here you have to ask another question three times to Me, ‘Mother’,or you can call me ‘Shri Mataji’,’am I the master’? Three times.

Now please put your right hand on the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Now I cannot force you to have the pure knowledge so you have to say, six times, ‘Mother please give me pure knowledge’. This you have to say six times because there are six petals to this centre. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge your Kundalini starts moving upwards. So we have to now open with our self confidence our upward chakras, our upward centres.

Now raise your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side. With full confidence please say, ‘Mother I am my own master’ ten times. Say ten times with full confidence.

Now please raise your right hand to your heart because the most important thing about you is that you are the Spirit. You are not this body. You are not this mind. You are not this ego. You are not conditionings. You are pure Spirit. So now here please say with full confidence twelve times, ‘Mother I am the Spirit’. Have no doubts about yourself.

Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and the shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here now you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times, ‘Mother, I am not guilty at all’. As I told you, that ‘Divine’ is the ocean of love, bliss and joy. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness, so you can not do anything that this ocean can not dissolve. Even if you now think you can punish yourself by saying it 108 times that Mother I am not guilty.

Now put your right hand on your forehead, acrossand press it on both sides and put down your head. Here now you have to say, ‘Mother, I forgive everyone,’ from your heart, not how many times. But really please forgive. If you don’t forgive you will not feel the cool breeze coming out of your head , out from your hands.

Now please take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head and press down your hand. Here without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, without thinking of the past. Just from your heart, you say for your own satisfaction,’O Divine, if I have done any mistakes please forgive me’.

Now stretch your hand and put the centre of your palm on top of your head on this soft bone which was there in your childhood. Push back your fingers and put down your head and press your scalp moving very slowly, seven times clockwise, and I will know for sure, self realisation, but here you have to know that I can’t force it on you. So you have to say seven times, ‘Mother, please give me my Realisation’, because I cannot overcome your freedom. Put the hand on your head. On the soft bone which is quite in front. Push back your fingers. Bend your head please.

[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.]

Please take down your hands. Open your eyes. Please put your hands towards Me. Now put your right hand towards Me and bend your head and see for yourself above the head if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Pay attention here. Some people will get hot, doesn’t matter. And some people get very far away. Please bend your head properly.

Now try with your left hand, put the right hand [down]. Now see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Don’t get upset if it is not there. Don't get upset. Now please put your right hand towards Me and see with left hand again.

Now please put both your hands towards the sky and push back your head and ask any question to Me three times, ‘Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?’ Is this the cool breeze of Divine love’. ’Is this the all pervading power?’. Now put down your head, hands towards Me. Now watch Me without thinking,you can do it.

Now those who have felt cool breeze on their head or  in their fingertips, please raise both your hands. Now don’t doubt. You might think because there is a air conditioning. It has nothing to do with air conditioning. Your air conditioner is your head. Those who have felt really, please be honest, you don’t have to feel shy about. Quite a lot of people. I wish I was here for one day more. But in any case I will meet you all just now. Individually and see what is the problem. Thank you very much.
