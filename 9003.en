[Talk of Shri Mataji starts after 5.20 minutes]

I apologise for being late because we were held up in a ..(.UNCLEAR). Now as we talk of truth,we have to be very honest about it.If you see, in our seeking, whatever we  see may not be the truth.For example many people believe in certain idiologies.Many believe in certain religions, certain faith. Some believe in certain  theory,some believe in some psychological thing but we have to know that truth  cannot be through our mental projections.If it were so, we would have all thought the same.  Whatever one may follow  or believe,  all are capable of anything that is... (UNCLEAR).Every one (INAUDIBLE)....that if you want to know the truth it has to be one.It cannot be (INAUDIBLE) So very humbly we should accept that so far we are not connected.(INAUDIBLE)...if people put forward a hypothesis and if it is true,  as honest people we have to accept it.Already it has been explained, I am sure, about this subtle system that exists within us.

What ever religion you may follow, whatever  faith you may follow, whatever ideology you may follow, this system exists within us.

So Sahaja means 'Sa' means 'with' and 'Ja' is 'born with you'.Yoga, means 'union with the Divine'.So the right to be 'united' to the Divine or the 'Divine  power' which is 'all pervading', is  belonging to all of you.And this Divine power exists that we know  but we are not yet aware of.This is the divine power that does all the living work.The seed becomes a  tree.The tree has the flowers and the flowers becomes the fruit and how does it happen?How a seed becomes a fruit?So there is some power which is working  in a very.... (UNCLEAR.) Now, you see a flower, a rose flower comes out of a rose or a orange comes out of a orange tree.There is no choice. But..( UNCLEAR)...all having (UNCLEAR) built-in.

and above which one of the .... (INAUDIBLE). Christ has said that, 'you are to be born again'.But that doesn't mean you put a label on your head saying I am born again or I am great.So that... (INAUDIBLE)

we......(UNCLEAR) to the never give us what is promised.

All the scriptures all over the world have said one thing in common. That is, we have to seek  the truth...(INAUDIBLE)..

We have to arrange a talk on Self-realisation so that we  achieve our Self realisation. According to Indian mythology this is Kalyuga.Bad Days.Very bad days.(INAUDIBLE)...This will happen...

So today thousands of people are getting  their Self realisation.Sahaja yoga is working in thirty five Nations.It is a living process and you can't pay for it.If you have to sow a seed,how much do we pay to the seed or to the mother earth?Both of them do not understand money..So one has to know one thing.You can not pay for any living process.And we should not be deluded by big advertisements and once you get money the people can advertise.

One has to only think of one's  Self realisation and one must get that 'special awareness' which is called 'Collective Consciousness'.There the microcosm becomes the macrocosm and you can feel it on your finger tips (INAUDIBLE) Not only that but you can feel  your own system and your ..(INAUDIBLE)....and you can feel of the others on your finger tips.Mohamed Saheb has said that your hands will speak and they will give witness against you. This is a 'Happening' that has to take place.Every human being ....(INAUDIBLE).Some get it very fast and some get it late because of the obstructions in your subtle centres.But it can be cleared out, but you should have patience with your self.Now the time has come for you to know your own growth.I will give you an example of Television.When we take it to the village in India  they see all kinds of beautiful pictures they can't believe it.(INAUDIBLE).. but when it is put to the mains then they are amazed.In the same way you get connected acting like absolute....( INAUDIBLE)You can know about your self.You can know about others, you can know everything you want to know.Some people are so frustrated in life they are disappointed they take (INAUDIBLE)..That is not

true.Even the science can be foretold with out even knowing science.So many such things have happened and the people who have got  realisation are cured of their incurable diseases. Their mental problems have been solved and they live a life of joy.Joy is not a thing like happiness and unhappiness.It is single. When I came I saw people . (INAUDIBLE). ....and some body told me that (INAUDIBLE)....This is the situation because we do not know that there is a more 'Power'.

We have come from amoeba stage to become something more.I hope today, it works out with you all and (INAUDIBLE).But Barcelona was much better.They said Mother, 'this time please try and come again' and I think it has worked that you all are here.But I have to make a request, even if you get (INAUDIBLE)....you have to put your collective programs.Only once a week you may give little time  to your self and that will make you the masters.I hope  it is going to work out for all of you.

May God bless you.

Last time there were so many questions.I did not know what they were talking about.Better you ask me questions otherwise while you are getting realisation you will  think why we did not ask these questions.By asking questions or by answering or  by reading books...you do not get realisation.It has to work out.May God bless you all.

CLAPPING

Question and answer session with the audience.

Sahajayogi: INAUDIBLE

Shri Mataji:Now the thing is, see you come in this room and when   you want to put on this light you have to just switch on everything comes on INAUDIBLE ...You will know everything, I promise you.

Sahajayogi:: What you mean by collective consciousness?Is it like UNCLEAR..is it like..

Shri Mataji:No,no,. Again the same thing I can explain today but as I said there but they said they did not know.I can tell you now if he wants to know.You see, 'the all pervading power' which is doing all the living work,that is the one, first time you start feeling on your finger tips.In modern times one should not start talking about God because INAUDIBLE... very dangerous.

First of all we must discover whether  it is so or not.It is  experiment.If it is, so then we can find out more.I will explain to you every thing.I promise you.

Sahajayogi: INAUDIBLE.Is it diamond..

Shri Mataji: Which one?Is this diamond.No,no,it is nothing to do with diamonds.It is Shirdi Sai Nath,one who is the 'Real' one.It is related to all real people.But you will not come to know  'real' and 'unreal' until you get your self realisation.

Sahajayogi:When you give realisation how do you raise your kundali?How do you do?

Shri Mataji: That I will do.Later on you can do also.Like one enlightened light can enlighten another light.When you will be enlightened, you can do it.He can do it.

Sahajayogi:You spoke about conscious but if I recall consciensia in Italian, Latin probably is cunscentia that means all our knowledge put together.

Shri Mataji:True,yes, that's what I mean.Thankyou very much.Thank you.It is the same.Did you follow that sir?

Sahajayogi:I have one more question.Is it true that we have 64 other  levels of..Do we have 64 levels?

Shri Mataji:No, we don't have such levels as such, but  you see, if your attention moves to the side, there are 7 layers on left side and 7 on right side...and then you do get UNCLEAR so. as..I said all this you will understand very well when you will be coming to the program.I am very happy to meet you.In any case you must join.Alright.So  you will know all about it.The levels are, just now, first of all is to get your Self realisation, and then actually the movement now is upwards so the first stage when you cross this centre then you get  what we call as 'thoughtless awareness'.That means if you want to think you think and if you don't want you don't think, you are at peace.Then you cross over and pierce through here, on your Fontenelle bone.That is the actualisation of Baptism according to Christianity,I would say and you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of  your head itself.Now you have another state where you start establishing   your connection.Then the second stage what we call as, doubtless awareness 'Nirvikalpa Samadhi'.At that stage you become completely knowledgeable and you (UNCLEAR) God. Now these are the two stages  you have to achieve.

Sahajayogi:He is asking (UNCLEAR) mental problems can be cured?

Shri Mataji:Ofcourse, ofcourse.We have cured many people of drugs, ofcourse.(UnCLEAR) there are alcoholics,drug addicts, these violent people,all that.

There is a doctor we have who was  a alcoholic and drug addict.We cured him and now he is incharge of  seven hospitals in (UNCLEAR..) .It also cures people who have been to wrong, false gurus and have been affected by them.

Sahajayogi:He says that he works with the drug.UNCLEAR.

Shri Mataji:You  get all of them.We will put them right.  Yes.Its very simple.Very simple.Actually in the West people are taking drugs because they.UNCLEAR...I don't blame them.

Sahajayogi:Last question.He is saying UNCLEAR some organization..UNCLEAR age of Aquarius?

Shri Mataji:It is.It is the age of Aquarius.Aquarius is the Kundalini .The Kundalini that rests in the  triangular bone is called as Kumbha.In Sanskrit language kumbha is in English language it is Aquarius.There are so many theories pointing out towards Sahajayoga.Most of them are in the air.They have not been able to find something substantial.

Is this  the last one?

Sahajayogi:Is there any similarity, relationship between kundalini and Japanese word khi?

Shri Mataji:Yeah. Have you heard about Tao?

Sahajayogi: Whether the khi is type of  yoga?

Shri Mataji:Yes it is.But so far  they have n't got many people realised.  I met the leader.  He told me that from the third century, there has been no kusyapas with  realised souls. He was very honest  I   would say.He came for curing himself so very honest.

Sahajayogi:Shall we have the Realisation?

First  and foremost thing is that we have to be pleasantly placed towards ourselves,and we should not have any guilt in our mind.After all only  the human beings can make mistakes. God doesn't make mistakes.So there should be no guilt of anything what so ever.Forget the past at this  moment.We have to think of the present.Now we have to understand that though  it works spontaneously,we have to give help to our centres and I will tell you how to do it.First of all you have to take the help of the mother earth so if you don't mind you can take out your shoes without(UNCLEAR).

Please take out your shoes.Second thing is you don't have to.(UNCLEAR).You have to be comfortable.(Comehere.)It will hardly take15 minutes  but I will request you, do not have to get up half way and walk out. I will explain to you, what you have to do now with open eyes and then you have to close your eyes because your attention will be drawn inside. There will be  no complications, you will not feel anything.Ultimately most of you  will feel the cool breeze coming out from your head and also in your hands.So at the very outset I will request you for one more thing,  that please forgive everybody.Without thinking, with out counting mistakes, without counting people, just forgive everyone.Very important.After all when you say, I forgive, you don't do anything .And then you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything,but when you don't forgive then you play into the hands of false gurus.Now what we have to do  is to just   understand, that you have to place your left hand  like this towards Me.The left side is the desire, the power of desire,that you have the desire to have your  Self realisation.Now the right hand is to be used for releasing your centres because this is the power of action.You have to put both your feet apart from each other and when you close your eyes you can take out your spectacles also.Till I tell you please don't open your eyes.

So now be pleasantly placed towards yourself.You have to love ourselves.Human beings are  the epitome of evolution.They are highest in the universe and the whole creation of this world.The whole creation of God.So we have to love ourselves.May God bless you.

Now close your eyes before I tell you then after wards close your eyes.Not just now, when I tell you to close then you can do it.Now with the right hand,now you have to put  left hand towards me and right hand on your heart because in the heart resides the Spirit.All of you should do it.Second we work only on the left side.So take this right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.So this is the centre of your mastery and that is how you should press your hand here.With your fingers press here.Then you have to take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre which gives you all your central nervous system, gives you awareness and also you can work out the laws of the divine.So this is the centre of pure knowledge.Now again you raise your right hand in the upper part of the abdomen on the left hand side.Raise your right hand on your heart again.Now your right hand goes between your shoulder and your neck like this from the front side,  and turn your head to your right.Now this is the centre you catch when you feel guilty.But this is a very dangerous centre because it gives you also angina and other spinal cord trouble like spondylitis.So please, please do not feel guilty at all.Now put this right hand on your forehead across.This is the centre of forgiveness.Bend your head.Now put this right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head.This is the centre through which we ask for forgiveness, but we do not feel guilty and count our mistakes.Now stretch your hand and put the centre of your palm on top of your Fontenelle bone area which was a soft bone.Now stretch your fingers outward and press it hard,  and now move your scalp very slowly clockwise seven times.Bend your head.Thats all we have to do.Your hands are very hot.Doesn't matter.

Now put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.Now close your eyes.Keep your left hand all the time towards Me and be comfortable.Now at this point you have to ask Me a very fundamental question,three times, 'Mother am I the Spirit'? In your heart.Three times.Now you have to know that if you are the spirit, you are your master, your guide.Your spirit will guide you.Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side.Now here you have to ask another question three times to Me, 'Mother',or you can call me 'Shri Mataji','am I the master'?Three times.Now please put your right hand on the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side and press  it hard.Now I can not force you to have the pure knowledge so you have to say,six times, 'Mother please give me pure knowledge'.This you have to say six times because there are six petals to this centre.As soon as you ask for pure knowledge your Kundalini starts moving upwards.So we have to now open with our self confidence our upward chakras,our upward centres.Now raise your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side.With full confidence please say, 'Mother I am my own master' ten times.Say ten times with full confidence.Now please raise your right hand to your heart because the most important thing about you is that you are the Spirit.You are not this body.You are not this mind.You are not this ego.You are not conditionings.You are pure Spirit.So now here please say with full confidence twelve times, 'Mother I am the Spirit.'Have no doubts about your self.Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and the shoulder and turn your head to your right.Here now you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times, 'Mother,I am not guilty at all'.As I told you, that 'Divine' is the ocean of love, bliss and joy, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness, so you can not do anything that this ocean can not dissolve.Even  if you now think you can punish yourself by saying 108 times that Mother I am not guilty.Now put your right hand on your forehead and press it on both sides   and put down your head.Here you have to say, 'Mother, I forgive everyone,' from your heart, not how many times.But really please forgive.If you don't forgive you will not feel the cool breeze  coming out of your head or  your hands.Now please take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head and press down your hand.Here with out feeling guilty, without counting the mistakes, just from your heart for your own satisfaction say,'O Divine, if I have done any mistakes please forgive me.'Now stretch your hand and put the centre of your palm on top of your head on this soft bone which was there in your childhood.Push back your fingers and put down  your head and press your scalp moving very slowly, seven times clockwise, and I will know for sure, self realisation, but here you have to know that I can't force it on you.So you have to say seven times, 'Mother, please give me my Realisation', because  I cannot overcome your freedom.Put the hand on your head on the soft bone which is quite in front.Push back your fingers.Bend your head please.Take down your hands.Open your eyes.Please put your hands towards Me.Now put your right hand towards Me and bend your head and see for yourself above the head if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.Some people will get hot.Doesnt matter.And some people get very far away.Please bend your head properly.Now try with your right hand.Now see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.Dont get upset if it is not there.Dont get upset.Now please put your right hand towards Me and see again.Now please put both your hands towards the sky and push back your head and ask any question three times, 'Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?'Is this the cool breeze of Divine love'.'Is this the all pervading power?'Now put down your head.Now watch Me with out thinking,you can do it.Now those who have felt cool breeze on their head or  in their finger tips, please raise both your hands.Now don't laugh.You might think because there is a air conditioning.It has nothing to do with air conditioning.Your airconditioner is in your head.Those who have felt really, be honest, you don't have to feel shy.Quite a lot of people.I wish I was here for one day more.But in any case I will meet you all just now and see what is the problem.Thank you very much.
