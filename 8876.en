Shri Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 20 July 2008.

Today is a very great day for all the sahaja yogis.
Because Sahasrara opened in you, you could feel the existence of God. By saying there is God that was not sufficient and to say that there is no God also was wrong, very wrong and people have suffered, who have said like them. Only after getting realisation you know that there is God and there are vibrations. It’s a very big opening all over the world. Today I say that’s why is one of the greatest days for you.
Many of you have felt the cool breeze on your hands and out of your brain. Some have grown in Sahaja Yoga, some have not. Some are still carrying on with old catches. But now I have to say that quite a lot of you can become gurus, means teachers, and you should act as teachers.
To act as teacher you should know Sahaja Yoga, the theory and the practice of it, thoroughly well and then you can become a guru. It’s a very responsibility, lot of understanding, for a guru.
You should not have any ego, first; you should not have any of your chakras catching; you should be absolutely clear all the time and there the vibrations should be flowing in both the hands. If they are moving in one hand at not an other you cannot become guru. So you have to be a perfect sahaja yogi. Then only you can be a guru, and so many of you can be, but you have to ascertain first: are you capable of being your guru or not.
With humbleness you will understand. Those who think that they can be gurus should become gurus, because now I can’t travel from places to places and you have to do my job, is to give realisation to people.
But you have to be able to give en-masse realisation, then only you can be a guru. If you can give an en-masse realisation then you could be a guru. You can use my photograph but the realisation should not be from the photograph, but from you. Then only you can be a guru.
There can be ladies or men, both can become gurus and spread Sahaja Yoga all over.
In my whole touring business, Canada I have missed and I would request some of you to go to Canada because it’s a very beautiful place and we have very beautiful sahaja yogis there.
You have to do now my work. I won’t be able to go all over, but you have to go to other countries and create new sahaja yogis. You can do it. To begin with you can use my photograph but later on you can only put the photograph there but use your own powers and give realisation. You can do it and that is how we can spread Sahaja Yoga all over the world.
I have done my level best now, but I don’t think now I can travel any more, so I’m telling you that you have to take over and work it out. That doesn’t mean you cancel me, no not at all. I am there with you and every place you work you put my photograph, but realisation you have to give and try to give mass realisation. If that doesn’t work out then you should know you are not a guru. If you can give mass realisation, then only you are a guru. Otherwise you are not. I said you can use my photograph but you have to give realisation to people. This is the sign of a guru.
Then you already know what are different centres and what are the things missing in people. I’ve explained very clearly. In the same way you’ll find those who come for realisation, they’ll have some defects and you’ll find out what chakras they are catching. You know how to clear those chakras, so you have to tell them how to clear. Now you have mastered Sahaja Yoga, so you should know what is to be done. If you think that you have mastered, if you believe that you have mastered, then you can become gurus.
But first of all you should ascertain and find out for yourself if you are a guru or not. It is your responsibility now to give realisation to people and you can give if you have vibrations as like a guru. Or ladies also, they called as gurui, not as gurus, but as guruis, but they can be called as guru also. And they can also do this work very well.
Solving the problems of people is not difficult then. Once they get realisation their problems should be solved.
This is a big power you have got, you all should use.
First of all you can use a group if you want and afterwards you should do it individually.
Can you imagine all of you, if you become gurus, how many sahaja yogis we’ll have all over the world?
Whatever you teach you must practice. When a person who drinks, cannot become a guru. A person who flirts and has a licentious life, cannot become a guru. So first examine yourself: are you clean or not?
If there are many possessed people who try to become gurus, they cannot. Honesty, you should see on the photograph if you are possessed, then you cannot be guru.
So now to become a guru is first to criticise yourself, to find out yourself fully, and then you can become a guru.
I don’t want to tell anybody individually but you all can find out.
Say four-five people can join together and they can find out from each other if they are all right or not, if there is missing, if they are catching. But if they say there you are alright then you can become gurus and you can preach Sahaja Yoga. This is your responsibility. This is how Sahaja Yoga will grow. Otherwise after I’ll retire or I’ll don’t go anywhere, then Sahaja Yoga will go to waste. So it is for you to carry the torch, the light, it is your responsibility now. You have got your realisation.
I was born with the responsibility, I was born with all the understanding. And now you are also understanding yourself. Do not condemn yourself, as long as you start your own realisation, but be careful: don’t become egoistical. You have to be very humble, very humble with everyone. And work it out because if they are not realised souls you shouldn’t condemn them but tell them very patiently and sweetly that you are not alright. Tell them how to meditate, how to improve.
It’s now a very big responsibility.
Actually I have done this work and you can do this work also. So you all have to become a guru. This is the day of Guru Purnima and I bless you that you all become gurus.
Whatever you have got now don’t waste it, don’t throw away but use it for the betterment of people. If you want in the beginning have four to five people together. Then you should separate. You have to give time to this. You have got your realisation but you have to give realisation otherwise your state is not alright, is not normal.
So today I want to tell you what are the qualities needed for a guru.
First of all he should be a detached person. That doesn’t mean you give up your family or anything, but you should have a detached attitude that anybody from your family does wrong you should go away from him or her.
Secondly, through your realisation you can see that you can spread happiness and remove their problems. You have seen that whatever I have done you can do it. You have got power to do it but no hypocrisy. No hypocrisy, otherwise you’ll spoil the name of Sahaja Yoga. So if you are sure about yourself then only you should become gurus and carry the work of Sahaja Yoga.
I think I give you all my blessings and all my support that now you take over and become gurus. You can also have all the pujas and then you can use photograph.
You have seen how one has to work it out and if somebody has some defect or some chakras are catching then you should tell that person how to correct it. On the photograph it is the best. And very humbly you should tell them what is to be done and you can save all the people.
So now I am no more available in the sense I’ve done my best and I think I won’t be able to do this again. It is not my old age but I want to give you a complete freedom to spread Sahaja Yoga. You have got it free and you also have to give it to people free – not to charge them.
On the pujas days only, be careful that don’t put yourself on the puja, till you are confirmed and you are sure that you have created at least hundred Sahaja Yogis, good Sahaja Yogis. Then they can do your puja also.
But the best thing is to wait and see. You don’t [get] into puja business till you are – you have done about thousand people each, then you have the right to have a puja. But you could have a puja with My photograph till you are completely all right.
Now how confidence is the main thing. Do not condemn yourself. You are all realized souls, but those who can think they can become gurus, can become and try. You have to have patience with the seekers. You can’t be angry and hot-tempered. Unless until they try to trouble you, you shouldn’t lose your temper. You should be quiet.
Most of the gurus are very hot tempered, or have been before, and that’s why they were busy with their temper and they couldn’t produce anything sensible, I think. They could never give Realization.
So I have to warn you, control your temper. Watch yourself if you get angry, then you cannot become a guru.
Guru has to be a loving person, very loving and understanding. Then you have to be humble, not to abuse people, not to shout at people. If they misbehave, you can ask them to go out, but don’t shout. If you think somebody is misbehaving, you can ask that person to get out, but you need not shout or get angry with that person.
So it’s a very big responsibility now. You got your Realization and so four or five of you should join to form a Sahaja Yoga group, giving Realization to people. Try.
Of course, My photograph will be there, but still you must try. Try to understand that now what is your responsibility. If a position is given, you have to always carry on with the responsibility of that position. In the same way, if you become a guru, you have a certain amount of responsibility, that your own behaviour should be very good, to begin with.
In the beginning, you cannot tell them “Don’t go to church,” or “Don’t do this, don’t do that.” You give them Realization and then you can talk to them. In the beginning, you shouldn’t tell them or they’ll just shun you. Accept them as they are. In the beginning, you should not also cure people if possible. You can use My photograph to begin with, but don’t cure them. Later on if you are confident, then four, five together should treat that person. Curing people is not very easy and you may catch, so before acting on anyone you must take a bandhan. Bandhan is very good. You should, even when you are going out, you should take a bandhan.
You should also make a very good speech, if possible. Now you know so many things and you can talk to them. It’s a very big responsibility.
Now I have been working from the year 1970 and today so many years I have worked so hard, but I can’t now do it. I have to go back and take some rest as everybody has said, and you will also agree. But you can tell about Me, if it is necessary, but use My photograph. Every time you have a meeting use My photograph.
Those who think they can be leaders and, as gurus, they should first see their own vibrations, meditate on My photograph and find out. You have to be absolutely honest that you are hundred percent all right and there is no catch and then you can become a guru. You have to be. First you may get two people, then three people. I started with five.
So you can imagine how one can go with it. Try first of all with two, three, five and more. You can also advertise afterwards, if you have given Realization to people, say about – you have given Realization to ten people you can start your own organization, or whatever you may call it, and can work it out.
Now you have the power, you have the right, but you must have a temperament also. In the beginning, you have to be very patient and kind – very kind. Then gradually you will find that you can cure people. You can use My photograph for curing to begin with and later on you can see you can cure.
First of all on vibrations, you’ll see what chakras are catching, which are good, which are bad. And then you should correct them.
If there’s something wrong, you must correct it and then become guru. It is not just accepting that “I am guru” that you become guru, but you have to be very, very – authority on yourself. You have to judge yourself. First of all you should find out: can you become gurus? And then you can send me your reports. I’d be very happy to know how many you have got now. And that is how Sahaja Yoga would spread, no doubt.
It cannot remain at this stage because I am withdrawing, but because now you are now so many Sahaja Yogis, it will grow and work out. But I think now I can’t travel, and I am going back. I won’t be able to come back again – not possible.
So you better work it out for yourself.
You must write to Me if you have any difficulties, if somebody is catching or something, or you have [a] problem. Now I don’t think any newspaper will criticize you. They have done it for Me, but not for you. All of you promise Me that you’ll try to become gurus. I didn’t take any money from you, nothing from you. I just want that you should spread Sahaja Yoga.
In the beginning, even in the pujas don’t take any presents or money. You can only take little money from them if you have need to have a hall or a big place, but that will be much later. First of all, try with few people. It will grow very well. Now another thing is puja you should not allow them to do to you, to begin with. Till you have done three hundred Sahaja Yogis, you can’t ask them to do you puja. You can use My photograph for the puja to begin with, but be very careful because you have powers now and it might pamper your ego, maybe you start thinking you are great – no. You have to save the world. All My work is that, and I would ask you to write to Me in India if there is any difficulty.
Also write to Me how you are spreading Sahaja Yoga, what is happening, I would like to know. But I think you will understand that I must retire now. I can’t travel.
If you have any questions, ask Me.
Those who are confident that they can become gurus, raise your hands. Oh, so many. Only one hand, not two.
If anybody is making money, you should tell him not to do it and also write to Me. You cannot make money to begin with, but when you have about three thousand people, you can celebrate all the worshipping days and worship. But you must make at least three thousand disciples, each. Then you can ask for a puja.
There are some people who cannot become gurus, who are catching and they have problems. If you have problems, don’t become guru, otherwise it will affect you. But if you think you are clear and opened out, then you can become gurus. Is there any question?
I am opening a centre for international Sahaja Yoga and when you have done with three hundred Sahaja Yogis, you can ask them to do puja and take money. Before that, if you get any money, you can send it to that centre. There would be about eleven members in that centre and I’ll declare it. If you have any questions, ask Me now.
First three hundred people you don’t take any money, except for the hall or except for other expenses. But you don’t take any money for yourself. Now can you raise again your hands how many would like to be gurus?
May God bless you.
Do you have any questions?
You can take money or not, on an organization basis, that you have to have a hall, loudspeaker, and all those things. But you shouldn’t take it for your individual use, you should be very careful. Till you have three hundred Sahaja Yogis. You can form a group of five to ten people and start your work. You will enjoy it. Any one has any problem, ask Me.
I have to go to Canada – I have not been, but I’ll try to find some time. First now I have to go to Russia, and then I can go to Canada. You have to work more in your country than outside to begin with, and then you can spread it all over. Again let us see how many want to be gurus?
Oh! What a big number. Thank you very much, thank you, thank you all.
