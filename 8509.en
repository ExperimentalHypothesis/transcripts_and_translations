Nav Varha Pooja Talk – Sahajayogi ki Pahechan

Place: Delhi, India

Type: Pooja

Speech language: Hindi

Every year comes a new year and the previous year gets completed. For Sahaja yogis every moment is a new year because they stay in the present. Neither do they stay in the future, nor in the past. Every moment for them is a new year, a new hope and a new wave.

Just like while swimming in the ocean, every moment they get risen by the love of ocean, in the same manner every Sahaja yogi keeps on getting happiness, love, peace and excitement. But the actual point is whether we have learnt to swim or not. Whoever learns swimming in Sahaja yoga, he will only swim in happiness, will swim in the sea of happiness. If there is any shortcoming or flaw in Sahaja yoga, it is that after realization, you have to become. Without achieving your becoming, you cannot achieve Sahaja Yoga. Mother has put you in water, but even after becoming a swimmer, you have to learn how to make others swim, how you can save others, how you can make others to swim. You have to become totally. If this is the only flaw, then it is in Sahaja yoga, but it fills many flaws.

Like in the past, Gurus did not arrange for your peace and happiness. Earlier, they used to make you work hard, ask you to “work hard”, make you clean up. Before getting your peace of mind, you were asked to cleanse your mind. Before enjoying body comfort, give sufficient hardship to the body. After great penance, people could achieve God Almighty, and these vibrations which you have achieved in Sahaja, could be understood by them.

But Mother has made a different arrangement for you, first receive your vibrations (“Chaitanya”) understand that God Almighty (“Paramatma”) is there, keep faith in that which is not blind, in the form of truth. And now, with little effort also, you can accomplish a very big achievement. Like you teach somebody that look, do not be frightened of water. Just a lecture be given. First you try yourself swimming on the ground. Try the swimming strokes at that place two to four times with your hand.  And after working hard for some days, then slowly be brought into water. Soon after seeing water, again run away.

Another method is to push into water, then they keep learning. In the same manner, you have been thrown into the ocean of happiness. Now if you want to enjoy this, you have to take some trouble. And the trouble is that you have to become, it is not possible without you achieving your becoming.

You have to call such a person a Sahaja yogi, who has total satisfaction, who has achieved, whose pure desire has been fulfilled. Because, Kundalini is the power of pure desire. A person whose pure desire has been fulfilled, one whose power of pure desire has shown its miracles completely, then there is no desire left for such person. A person who is fully satisfied, is a real Sahaja yogi. If there is any unfulfilled desire still remaining, then it means that the awakening of the Kundalini is not complete. You have not yet become a full-fledged Sahaja yogi.

It is surprising that even without becoming a proper Sahaja yogi, blessings keep coming, and miracles keep happening, you keep getting the benefits. You continue to be aware that “we are on the move, everything is in place, things are happening, and we are moving forward.”

But, the biggest blessing for a Sahaja Yogi is in that he gets the ability of giving, and he gives. And he not only gives, he enjoys that happiness of giving, which is a very unique happiness. And that happiness, you can never get in any worldly matter. And all the blessings and all such things cannot be obtained from any one. The biggest blessings is in that, your power of the Guru principle may increase and you get the ability such that you can give that to others. When this ability comes in you, then understand that the work of Mother is complete, and your work has commenced. Till such time that state is not achieved, efforts should be continued, and you have to achieve your becoming. This is the only flaw of Sahaja yoga, about which I speak in the capacity of Mother, that I will try my best not to leave any shortcomings from my side. I try to do as much as possible to see that nothing is incomplete from my side so that on account of me, my children should not have any shortcomings.

But your penance (“tapasya”) is also important. Without that, no work can be done. But it should not be that such penance is fiery (“ugra”) or scorched (“santapta”). It is a peaceful penance. There is nothing hard in this penance. It is not a laborious penance.

So, first of all Sahaja yogis should learn to love. This is a very big thing. Like, when I hear any complaint from anybody that this Sahaja yogi, you say that Sahaja yoga is a very good thing, he ill-treats his own mother. His wife is dominating. He beats his sister.  He beats his wife. Some do not take care of husband. There is no attention on children. In Sahaja yoga, all this should be spontaneously. It happens spontaneously. If this does not happen, then how will Sahaja yoga happen?  When you have become tree, whoever is sitting in the shadow of the tree, no problem can come on them. A tree can take on all the burden of difficulty. Whoever are under the shade of your relationship, should be very loving and close to one another.

Now, whatever I am saying is being said individually to all of you. Not for anybody else, please understand this and listen. There are many people who feel that when I am telling them, they think of others, perhaps Shree Mataji is telling about them. So one should keep the attention on ourselves, that Mother loves us all individually. In the same manner we also should know everybody individually. When we are unable to love our family, then we cannot love outsiders.

Understanding the requirement of family, agreed many people do not get realised. Could be that they have some faults. But, whatever is essential for them, do that. The matter of realisation will be accepted only when they see some change in you. If you just take a stick and say “why do you not get your realisation, why don’t you come to Sahaja yoga”, then nobody will come to Sahaja yoga. On the contrary, this is not the way of Sahaja yoga. The system of Sahaja yoga is that you have to impress others by your own ideals and your own personality. When the other gets totally impressed, then you slowly bring him into Sahaja yoga. Even if you somehow drag anybody forcibly and bring him to Sahaja yoga, and make him sit, then will he get his realisation, you only need tell. One should be able to come with full freedom.  If not today, he will be alright tomorrow. So, it should be kept in mind that when we are achieving our becoming, then along with us many are getting their becoming. And the attention of all these people are on us. How we are developing, is a very important thing. And in this you should understand one thing that whoever is your Guru, even if he is a realised soul, poor thing he will have to do whatever has to be done, with his own efforts. He will not say that you also become something. He will say that he is already useless, he has accepted me as Guru and that itself is great. We can see about this in their next birth. But Mother has undertaken a slightly big work. Her desire is that everybody should be made a ‘Guru’. It is a bit of a difficult work, and also not so difficult work. You all know that you all are in the making, slowly-slowly. Everybody is getting adjusted and becoming ready. That is why, when you are achieving your becoming, you take more care of others. Are you forgiving your neighbours and others? Have you forgiven everyone? There is a lot to learn regarding forgiving others. Many times I have said that forgiving others is a very big means and weapon available with us. And when we do not use this weapon, we do not apply this weapon, then we will not be able to arrange for anything else in this Kali yuga. After exercising forgiveness, we have to look at people with forgiveness. Peace will come only when you forgive. Whoever does not forgive, will not be able to get peace. Firstly, you forgive everybody and then you forgive yourself also. When you are able to do both these things, then you see that peace will come within you by itself. When the Agnya Chakra opens, then the door of peace opens up.

Mother is talking to a Sahaja yogi in the background (not clearly audible).

Now another thing which is always there before me and I also tell you, is that a kind of discipline is required in the hard work put in by you for achieving you’re becoming.  Many people say “Mother, I do not get time.” And then, you say that “Mother, see I had this problem, and this problem has not become alright.” Then I can also say that I had no time. Whether I meet you or not, I will always have time for you. My work goes on for 24 hours. You have to look only after your work. For this, you have to combine time and discipline. This body, without being disciplined, will become like a motor car which moves dragging all and do not know which pit it will go and fall in.

There is an easy way of disciplining this. First of all look into yourselves that two powers are active, one is the power of desire and the other is power of action. In the case of the power of desire, it should be such that there should be only one desire i.e. Pure Desire. What is this pure desire? That we should unite with our soul. We should become one with the spirit. This is pure desire. You give up all other desires now this moment. Give up at least for a moment. Do not desire anything else from Mother. “Just become one with the spirit.” You ask only for this pure desire. You give up all other things like this should happen, want this, want that, want a house, you give up all these things, at this moment. At this time you just think from your mind “a pure desire is that we should become one with God Almighty, and we should united with our spirit and we have no other desire.” You will see that your Kundalini has risen immediately.

And secondly, in your power of action, it should be such that whatever has to be done, it would happen spontaneously (“Sahaja”). People think that the meaning of Sahaja is we can keep sitting, and all things will come in our lap. This is a very wrong way of thinking. This extremely wrong feeling has come in us regarding Sahaja that we keep sitting and things should come to us. You have seen that there is a seed which when we put it in the womb of Mother Earth, it looks like the seed has sprouted spontaneously. But is it Sahaja? You have seen the effort, the poor small seed has to sprout, which breaks through the Earth. You have seen the efforts of the small root, whose small cell is in the border, in the edge, which roots itself with a lot of effort. Now, what is the pure desire of it, it is how to strengthen the roots of this tree in the Earth somehow. Have you seen any other desire for this? The only thought of it is how to go under the Earth surface, from where the water can be drawn and given to the tree somehow. It does not think of anything else. And with how much of labour, it fights with the stones, fights with the mud, and somebody else roughens it up (“rondata hain”) it or troubles it any other way. Passing through all these slowly and with a lot of wisdom, it goes on its way. If any tree comes in the way, or anything that comes in its way, it will go round it. If any branches of the tree comes, it will go round it.  And if any stone comes across, it will also go round that and makes its way.

In the same manner, a Sahaja yogi has to go about with a lot of wisdom and be a sensible person and should take it up as responsibility in a way that “we have become responsible”. The inner wisdom that we have is our quality, our symbol, our goal. The wisdom within us, that we should put it on us, like we put a vermilion (“tilak”) grandly, we have put a symbol of our wisdom as a tilak, and we are wise. The meaning of wisdom is that, a person who is wise, does not go in for tantrums and does not get upset. He does not slip on small things and does not comment about things not being up to the mark, that being not good. He speaks with wisdom. This is a sign of greatness, a sign of maturity. In Sahaja yoga, a person who cannot be mature, is not fit for Sahaja yoga. You have to become mature, and wise as well.

It seems like a very difficult task, but it is actually not as much. We have seen small children in Sahaja yoga, they are quite wise, and they understand everything wisely. In the same manner, you are also having a tilak of wisdom that you are now a Sahaja yogi. And wise also and this is a matter of grandeur for your Mother. Those who do not have any sense, for them, people will say that they have not been taught anything by their Mother, are useless.  For namesake Mother is Adi Shakti and see some children, they are totally useless. Taking this wisdom, you should look at yourself, “that we have a responsibility. It is essential that we become sensible people before the world.”

Today, on the occasion of this auspicious day of New Year, I would like to tell you that in Sahaja yoga, we people should become very mature. New people have come, it is a matter of great happiness. Before them the wisdom of old Sahaja yogis should be seen. They have come, they have not got their realisation yet, there is something. Some are getting little vibrations, and some are not getting it. There is something lacking, some problem is there somewhere. Some have got their realisation so quickly and they feel that they have become great people. All sorts of mistakes happen. Even you have made mistakes, it should not be forgotten. That is the reason you should show some largeness (of heart) (“badappan”) to them. Showing largeness does not mean that we show tantrums or project ourselves as if we are a big personality. Having largeness means having a kind of fatherly feeling. A fatherly feeling, a motherly feeling. You need to look at the new seekers with this feeling, having love towards them, which is like the love your Mother has on you, you should love them similarly. If we think that the people of the world are absolutely useless, then would we have been able to work out Sahaja yoga? And supposing if we only go on weighing ourselves, then we are alone in this world, with whom can we weigh ourselves ? But that question does not arise at all. Here it is like how many can be covered by us. Now our weight is reducing. In this shelter, how many people can we cover, whom all can we keep, this is the concern.

In the same manner, there should be wise love in your attention. It should not be such that some people call you a very stiff person. In that it should not be such that you tell people that you are a highly stiff person. But, you should maintain very simple, Sahaja love within you. And in that simple Sahaja love, you should have a fatherly approach, and keep a feeling of understanding. I keep a lot of confidence in you. In any matter, whether it is the matter of money, or your understanding (“samajhadar”). I always think that my children can never be mindless. Sometimes they are. But I have full faith that you all are very sensible (“samajhadar”) and are of very high quality.

Now, you see how bad the condition of our country is. Even if you search, you will not get a single proper person. Now even after coming to Sahaja yoga, if you do not improve your condition, then you will be like the crores of other such people who are in this country, how you can you be anything special? You have to be in a special form.

Now, many people say that “Mother, these days if cheating is not done, and then we cannot survive.” This is not correct. You give up and see. In the Kingdom of God, nobody can die of hunger. “Yoga, Kshema, Vahamyaham”. “Yoga, Kishema, Vahamyaham”. We will say again “Yoga Kshema Vahamyam”. After you get your Yoga, your wellbeing (“Kshema”) is my responsibility.  So, there is no necessity to do anything which is wrong work, I will look into the rest. God Almighty has saved you from so many bad conditions and he will continue to save you. You be rest assured in this matter.

That is why, you do not need to fall into any trap. These days thousands of traps have come about. There are thousands of traps from which Sahaja yogis have to come out. What is the wise thing?  Now, the dowry system is still continuing as a practice here. For Sahaja yogis, it does not befit to give dowry to anybody, or take.

Firstly, should not do such lowly things. Secondly, many people feel that we have to marry in our own caste. This is also a sign of foolishness. What is your caste?  You do not have any caste, you have become a Yogi. There is no caste for Yogis. Is there is any caste for a Hermit (“Sanyasis”)? Recently, we had gone to a Dargah, there he said that Sir, this is Oulia Chishti. He said his nephew, even he was also Chishti. Then I asked “What is the caste of this Oulia?” They said Oulia has no caste. We are also Oulia, we have no caste.

The meaning of Caste is aptitude. Caste - a caste which we acquired from the time of our birth. This cannot be acquired from the time of birth that you are born in Brahmin caste, or in Vaishya, or Shudra caste. You have been born, what is your aptitude (“capability”)?

In our country, another problem is caste, which Shree Guru Nanak has broken to a great extent. Shree Guru Nanak has broken it to a great extent, Saint Kabir has broken. But now their followers have made another caste. Even in that caste have been made. In Sikhs is there any less number of castes? They have also become caste based. Sikh cannot be a caste at all. Whoever is a Sikh, it cannot be a caste at all. This is the thing. Whoever breaks something, they become that only. Do not know how?

Amongst Hindus, whatever castes that were there, were all according to their Karma. Now you only tell me Matsyagandha, who was a fisherwoman whose son, who was not born out of the natural marriage process, he turned out to be such a child “Vyas,” who wrote the Geeta. Just think from where the matter reached where. Why? Why so? Why was someone not from a Brahmin family who is so called a pure person, this is a real big joke. Why such a person not write the Geeta? It has to be thought over. Why did Shree Krishna get it written by Vyas? What was the reason? This was because he wanted to break this very thought, and he wanted to get it written by such a person who was the son of Matsyagandha. He went to the house of Vidur, and ate food. Why? Just in order to break the custom. Shree Rama ate an already eaten fruit given by a woman of the Bhil caste. Why? Just in order to break this kind of foolish customs. Could he not have survived without the jujube fruit(“Ber”). And in case even if somebody eats, because Shree Ramachandraji ate, they will immediately go and wash their mouth. Why did he do all this? It has to be thought about. Knowing fully well, why did he do all this?   Because, such type of beliefs were getting strengthened in our country, caste, creed and all such foolish and useless things had to be broken. Just think, thousands of years ago such things took place. Prahalad was born in the house of a Demon (“Rakshas”). Shree Krishna’s own uncle was Rakshasa and see how he jumped from where to where. Shree Krishna also landed where, his own uncle was a demon. Could he not have got anyone better? Why did he have Kansa only as his maternal uncle? Why did he make him? Have to think. Because in spite of being his uncle, he had to kill him.

This relationship, for which we sell our country, these relatives, my brother, my son, my so and so relation, and all this we give so much of importance for these wasteful things. Shree Krishna said that “If Kansa is a demon, even if he is my maternal uncle, I will kill him.” This is the special quality in Indians. It is a different matter with the English people, while talking to them, we have to speak something else. There is a difference while talking to you. Those people do not agree with anybody, not even their own son. If they believe, then there would not be any other closer relationship for them. A son will kill his father, a father kills his son. It seems everybody is a demon in this matter. There are such people in India, that even if their son is a murderer, his mother will say, “Son, it does not matter, you have committed only a murder, just wash your hands, come and have your food. It does not matter, you are my life, no problem. You have your food, no matter you have committed a murder and come.” This is our country. Such blind eyes we have, this has been done to open them only, and this has been done. In the same manner, regarding the blind faith we have developed in temples, mosques and all such things, and even in Gurudwaras also, to open the eyes towards such blind faith, people have done a lot of hard work, put in a lot of efforts, a lot of efforts. Shree Guru Nanak himself wrote the “Grantha Sahib” for the reason that people give interpretations to the religious texts (“Shastra’s”), so he wrote the Grantha Sahib of such Gurus who were realised souls. Now Grantha Sahib is being read, people should at least see what has been written in Grantha Sahib. Whatever real facts he has written, at least understand the essence of that, otherwise you will be disrespecting Shree Guru Nanak. For the very same reason such confusion has badly affected all the religions. To the extent that people say that Shree Krishna had incarnated as Mohammad Ghazni, because Brahmins had been robbing the people (“loot machana”) and that is why Shree Krishna had incarnated as Mohammad Ghazni. This is the story. When he looted the Somnath temple, Shree Shiva (“Shankarji”) ran away from there and reached Shree Bhairavnath temple and said “Brother please save me from this person, he has been following me”. Shree Bhairavnath said “You are Shree Shiva, you are not afraid of anyone, what is the necessity for you to feel frightened, you just open your one eye and everything will be alright.” Shree Shiva said, “You go and see who he is. He is sleeping.” When Shree Bhairavnath went and saw that Virat himself was sleeping. He said, in the name of God, who will kill him?” Then Shree Bhairavnath said “Mother has given me one power, I will use that power”. Shree Brahmari Devi had given the power of Beetles (“Bhrunga”). So by using the power of Beetles, the Bees (“Bhramar”) went and by continual humming, they did allow Shree Krishna to sleep.  It is important for Shree Krishna to sleep at intervals, without which, a lot of havoc would be created in the world. Because his power of destruction (“hanana Shakti”) is quite powerful. People say that Shree Krishna got frustrated and he went away. Whether there is any truth in this story or not, I will not say anything in that matter. But this much I will say that when people trouble a person to this extent, then this kind of a story can also be made out. When in the name of God they are torturing others, having bloodshed (“khoon kharaba”), all these kind of things are happening, then people find it difficult to have belief also in the existence of God. To believe in God also becomes a kind of an impossible task. I do not consider it their fault, because those who are doing such things in the name of God, if they are so evil (“Mahadushta”). Now imagine if Yogi is making a gun (“Banduk”). Now, I am not able to understand what the relationship between a Yogi and a gun is? Brother you tell me, is your name Yogi? Many people have asked me what the relationship between yoga and gun is. I told that neither it is Shree Krishna’s weapon, nor the Devi had a gun. They must be imagining some weapons. So, such type of insane (“Vikshipta”) and bizarre (“Vichitra”) people have come in the present world. Due to such things also God’s name, some people think that God is just a myth, God cannot be actually there. Now, only Sahaja yogis know the actual truth, clearly they know and not just by intellect, but through vibrations, that God is there and his all-pervading power is operating everywhere. Only Sahaja yogis know this. Now, you people have understood quite a lot. Now, I am telling you that whatever you people know, even great yogis do not know – I mean the real yogis. I am talking about real yogis, they also may not know.  But, awareness has become such a thing, it is like music coming from the radio, and the radio has no effect of it. Beyond! (“aar-paar”). Whatever you had to know, you have come to know quite a lot. And you have also to know through the vibrations. But some of these vibrations are not working within us. They are working from outside. They have to be made to work from within as well. That is the reason, I tell you to discipline yourself. Make your instrument alright, and take these vibrations within yourselves.

In this regard, I say that people from Maharashtra work very hard, they are very hard-working. That is the reason their progress in Sahaja yoga is very deep. It is becoming deeper. That is the reason, you should take care of getting up daily, early in the morning. Now in England, it is so cold, and it is the biggest sin for the Britishers, if you want, kill them, you murder them, they will not say anything. But, if you wake them up in the morning, then the person is gone, finished. There is no other sin greater than this in England. If you wake up anybody before 9 o’clock in the morning, there is no bigger sinner, wicked, demon, other than you. In such a country they get up in the morning at 4 o’clock and have bath, at 4 o’clock. Their efforts. Reason being, whatever discipline they had before, now they have put it in Sahaja yoga. We people were never disciplined. We are all liberated people. We have all become Shree Bramha and sitting. When they have done so much of hard work, can we not do? “Now Shree Mataji do not ask us to get up at 4 o’clock in the morning, it will become too much”. I will not say. But you only think when do you have time? They get up in the morning and sit for meditation, in the cold of London. And with that hardwork only, they got realisation. It is hell there. In that hell they have created heaven, then it is not difficult to light a small lamp in the heaven. This is heaven only. Leave alone other matters. This is a big thing. This country is a great country. To do this work in this country, is not a hard task.

That is the reason I am telling you that the future leaders are you yourselves, sitting here. Now, any political or social and any more such “al’s” are there, in all of them there should be the evolution of the spirit, otherwise, no work can be done.

Now, you all are tomorrow’s leaders. From you only, through Sahaja yoga only, you will be ready. Now, I have to ask you as to how many of you are there who want to make your life pure, beautiful and completely dynamic. Becoming fearless, completely fearless, and will become special person and we ‘are’. You have become. As you say, you have become twice-born (“Dwij”). One egg was there, like understand that of Ego, Superego, after breaking open, you have become bird. But a small bird will be weaker than the egg. And for that reason should be given a lot of encouragement. Should be protected, should be cherished (“Sanjona”). And keep purity, love should be pure. Pure love. Very few people have a feeling of this.

What is pure love? Pure love is that which has no greed, nor does it have lust, no greed, and no lust and there is no type of dirt. It goes on flowing.

This pure love should flow as light from within us, this pure desire should be within us. When this starts happening, at that time you will become a respectable Sahaja yogi. Not before that.

And this speciality of becoming should be given due attention. Today, you will say “See Mother, please make this thing alright, Mother please make that alright.” Ok, I will do it. Will do it. But nothing will happen for you. Any child will say, “Mother please give this to me.” Ok beta, take it. You want it, take it. But, you have not become anything special. You have not achieved anything. You just went on running in and around mother. What is the benefit?  Whatever Mother wants to make of you, if you do not become that, then even Mother’s pure desire will not be fulfilled. It is a strange matter that you should be made, and that is my pure desire from within. And you have pure desire from within that you want to become something. When we are together like this, let us just be with pure desire.

And the first thing that is required to be with ‘pure desire’ is pure love. And in order to acquire pure desire, we have to purify our attention. When we go anywhere, then what do we see first “Oh, they have got this good thing, where has it come from? How did it come? The brain starts to run. They do not see how nice this thing is, how has it been made. Praise, Praise, Praise (Wah-wah-wah). See and enjoy. Good, it is not our head ache, it is somebody else’s, and it is very nice.

Like this, when you look at others, you should have appreciative temperament, but mostly the gaze goes on defects of the person. Like somebody says “Sir, the girl is good, but not attractive.” What is the meaning of attractive? What, will you go and stick to her at once, what is being attractive?  Till today, I have not understood the meaning of the word attractive. Especially the meaning of the word attractive, I have not been able to understand till date. Like “Sir, she is not attractive” I said brother, what is the meaning of attractive? What things attract you? Their nose, face, hands, skin, clothes or what? What is the thing?

Only one thing should attract, the spirit of others. That is the giver of happiness to others. Our attention gets disturbed by keeping our attention outside.

The attention should become deep. Penetrating, deep. How is it possible? If you had seen it earlier together, “Sir, that person is not alright, this person’s state is not alright”. The work has gone waste. That person is over, the spirit is also gone. All the hard work done by God Almighty on the person is all waste. “He is not alright” - all is over then. Did you go into its depth? Did you see? Did you search as to what it is? Go deep and see. And then you will see that everything is great at the depth within. Whatever it may be externally, and mostly however they are externally, and those who are too external and think great about themselves, they are sometimes very jumbled up from within.

That is why, you have to see what depth has been achieved. Then you see how the quantum of love increases. “Love is a deep thing.” When you look at anyone, measure their depth. Then you yourself will start going deeper into it. It is like “I am making a way from my heart for somebody.” I am going on making a way in my heart for somebody. I am going on making the path. In a similar manner just get into their depth. By remaining in superficiality, your attention will not be able to go to depth. And till such time that the attention does not go to the depth, your depth will not develop further.

So, you have to first get your attention deeper. The attention is currently on many external things. Like our ladies, I will talk about gents also. Like whether the blouse is matching or not, for that they will break their head. Blouse should be matching. In our times nobody ever wore matching blouse. With a blue sari we used to wear a yellow blouse. It was straight forward. If there was no yellow, red would be alright. Means, previously, there never used to be a contrast border, it would be made contrast. If it was not, then just wear as it is. Now in the past, how many saris would be there with a person? Two or three, however rich they were. Nobody used to keep lots of clothes. Now everything is about matching. Now ladies have so much of problem that if they do not wear matching clothes, then there will be an uproar in the whole city. “What type of clothes she had worn and come like a stupid.” But, if she wears q funny type of jeans and come with two horns, then she is modern. She becomes modern.

Such norms, such things that have been made by us, that we go on getting tied up in those norms. Now gents have a different kind of problem. Where do they have the time to go for matching their clothes? They keep seeing the watch. In everybody’s watch “what is the time”? “How much is the time”? When it is time to leave, instead of leaving the place, being leisurely, they are after the ladies, “Come on , there are only two minutes left, just one minute left.” Must have been a timekeeper. In the meantime, the women forget some twenty five odd things, they also forget, and run out. So much of hurry, so much of hurry. “It has become so late.” Show the watch, tell and remind, this is also a modern aspect. In the olden times, nobody used to behave this way. Because, previously there were no trains, and which train used to keep the time, that you are hurrying so much?  Neither plane, who used to keep up the time? You keep running after the plane. Did you know, yesterday, we sat there from morning to evening, the plane did not arrive. We were just sitting. But while leaving the house, there was so much of hurry, we forgot this, that. Three times, the vehicle was sent to bring it, but the plane did not come. You will say that Mother is only doing all this, because, we are slaves of the clock. It is possible. To be so much of a slave of the clock makes a person also mad.

When you come to Sahaja Yoga, you should know that the plane will be waiting for you. You come leisurely like a King (“Raja Sahib”). The plane will not take off, whatever happens. The plane will be standing there, or may be will arrive late. In case you are getting delayed, no problem, go like a King and in case you miss the plane, then go by another plane. Perhaps, something may be working out of this. Some Sahaja yogi may be getting connected. So many things like this happen. If you go on adding, the links will reach from where to where.

Once, I was going through Geneva. As such I have never missed a flight till now. This is also a surprising thing. One gentleman had missed his flight. He came hurriedly into the plane. By coincidence, he got a seat by my side. He was very nervous. His condition was quite bad. He was a Maharashtrian. I understood that he had come to my fold. I said to myself “Bitter gourd flavoured with neem”, (for him a situation that turned out to be even worse than feared), he has to be taken into the fold now. I spoke in Marathi “Sir, what is the problem?” He started speaking in Marathi, pure Marathi. He said “I missed my Flight. See what has happened.” I said “Nothing has happened to you. Some good thing is going to happen to you in this flight.” He saw me, he asked what good thing will happen? Then he saw “Are you Mataji Nirmala Devi?” I said “Yes”. He was taken aback, he got his realisation, in the flight itself. His name is Dr. Muthalik. He said “Sir, I was so anxious, and how could I know that I am going to get my self-realisation (“Aatma Sakhatkar”). I said “Yes, come leisurely now.” And, after that you know where all the matter reached. It brought it at the UN (“United Nations”), he brought this one, that one. He is a very big personality, he is the Director of WHO (“World Health Organisation”). Perhaps, he would not have come just like that. And by coincidence - Sahaja, he got his realisation. All these have to be seen with interest.

Ultimately, you think about this that after being a salve of the watch for so long, what have we achieved? Just like that, meaning even our fore fathers had tied watches, although their watched used to not work usually. By being tied to our watched, besides nervousness, we have not achieved anything more than that. And on account of slavery to this watch, what we have understood and what has emerged in this modern world is Leukaemia. As such, if you do not want to suffer from Leukaemia, then bid good bye (“tilanjali”) to this clock. Sometimes you keep the time forward and sometimes behind. I also do the same thing. Or keep just only one needle. Like when somebody asks “What is the Time?”, then say “Half past” or “Quarter past”. Ok. You can add the balance time to it, think of any number you wish to. Otherwise, there will be no time to enjoy. If you are always being a slave of the clock, where will be the time for you to enjoy? “Brother I don’t have the time for enjoyment.” But where are you going? To catch this, to catch that. This running race should be stopped by you. Everybody is running like mad.

In this way, women behave differently and men also behave differently. But we have made our norms. Like, have to go on time. I am not saying that this is wrong. Now, English people had made this statement that by going on time they won the battle of ‘Waterloo’. But, they could have lost too. Being on time does not make any difference. When the time came, they won and lost. This does not mean that when the programme of Shree Mataji is at 6 O’clock, you can come at 9 O’clock. For this, this Yogi is frustrated. And when the Mother is giving her speech then wife of Mr. Verma, children all are coming in line. Mother is speaking and they all keep coming. So, it is said that the door of the Mother is not closed for all.

But, it is the Court of your Mother. Many are sitting. All sorts of people are sitting from whom we should be careful. You should know about this. These people have come and gathered and are sitting here from even before I have come. They are sitting here, there and everywhere. That is why we should not take such type of liberty with Mother. We have to reach there before time. This is the work of God Almighty.  You should come equipped for the work of God Almighty. You should know about it. You should inculcate this discipline in yourself, I am not going to do that. When you get two-four smacks, you will realise and come again. Some loss will be there. You should reach well before time. You should take the responsibility, you are all responsible people. You should reach on time. You teach your children also. “There is Mother’s Programme.” It does not matter, if you drink one less cup of tea, does not matter. Come on, there is the programme of Mother, it is a very big thing. That is why we should reach before time. But, I will not tell. I have told these people also, keep the door open.

But, you only have to understand, you only have to know, and you only have to believe, you only have to handle it. Nobody is forced, punished, or any kind of restriction, is there in Sahaja yoga from our side. But it somehow happens automatically, as you know. This restriction is automatically enforced on you, because the happiness in the kingdom of God Almighty has always been eternal (“Aadi”), but the rules and regulations are also there simultaneously, and they are wonderful rules and regulations. And that is why we have to keep it safe and secure. We must bow our heads and think that “Today, we have to go to the Court of the God.” You understand that people used to go previously to Delhi Courts, you may be aware. So preparations used to start two months earlier. Special clothes used to be worn, there would be rehearsal as to how to go, and if you went, you were not allowed to show your back to the Viceroy. You had to bow and walk straight backwards.

This Viceroy belongs to which group? He was not even equal to the dust of the feet of the God Almighty. Much less than that. There is so much of greatness of God Almighty. So even if it is our Mother, the entire Court is full. And all those great Gods are sitting with discipline, laden with all weapons. All the arrangements have been made. They are all standing. They have all come with full preparation. See vibrations have also come. What strong vibrations are coming, they are all garbed (“Sajja”) at this time. When I am speaking, see how strong the vibrations are coming. That is the reason you should also be alert. They are seeing all of you, as to how you all are walking. That is the reason, you should come carefully, with your head bowed down. This you will understand slowly, as to where you have reached, what is your place, which higher state are you in. You start moving according to that state.

Recently, the marriage of the prince took place in London. People had come from far and wide, what a show (“Tamasha”) it was, do not know. But to attend this the wife of Mr. Reagan had come from America. And she was 15 minutes late, she came running in. And the commentary of all people was that “What will this lady understand, she was a model. Now she has become the wife of President, so what? What was real, that has come in the open. What will she understand regarding rules?”

So, that is nothing at all. That is nothing at all. But, you need to understand that what you have got is a big thing, is so high, and is so great. And as soon as you understand this greatness, you yourself will give special respect to this greatness.

I am not going to put any restrictions on you; you only have to grow. And who ever grows by themselves, those who will rise by themselves, will conduct themselves accordingly. We need not tell anything to that person. If any work takes place after telling, then it is not spontaneous (“Sahaja”). You, by your own sense (“Samajhdhari”) should rise, gain greatness and self-respect. You are by yourself distinguished, and you move forward keeping the same. When you talk amongst each other, your movements together, this should be self-driven. Owner driven is called self-driven. But that self (“Swa’”) is missing in that. Your self (“Swa”) has been awakened. You go on in that freedom of the self (“Swa”). That is being independent (“Swatantra”). And walking along on this path (“tantra”), the special form that you take, seeing that, the people will start thinking “What is this (special) thing, which is coming before us?”

This mad world requires this the most now. I need a little help from you. And if that happens, this world is going to change, it will change very fast.

All of you get together and try it. Give your best, understand your greatness. A lot has been written about Shree Mataji’s greatness. Now you must write your greatness. And understand that, from where to where you people have reached, and where to where we have to reach. On the eve of New Year, especially I had to say. “Live happily, live comfortably (“Sukh”), live peacefully, and keep smiling.”  But be connected with your dignity, never to give up your dignity. That day is not far off, when you see that you people will enlighten the entire World.

My infinite blessings to you all.
