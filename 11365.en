Talk During Music Night

You are all becoming now poets. I think the hearts are opening and expression is great, and these kind of songs should put a lot of vigor and courage in all of you. I am very happy that all of you are opening your heart and singing such nice songs, and reflecting My desires. May God bless you.

These songs are like Namadeva's Jogawa which is absolute Sahaja Yoga, nothing else but Sahaja Yoga. Every word is Sahaja Yoga, and this has been sung in our villages, in Indian villages, specially in Maharashtra, for thousands of years now, and still they didn't understand what it was meaning. They didn't know; they were just singing it, and sort of hoping for the thing. Like also Gyaneshwara has written- twelfth century [ie 1200s] - a beautiful poem about Sahaja Yoga, very beautiful. It's regarded as the masterpiece of his work, and that is being read and re-read, and people are hoping for it. I hope you know that song [MARATHI. SOUNDS LIKE "ATTA VISHWATMA KE TO SHAVE TO SHUNI DYAVE"; NO?]. In that song he says that, "The Soul of the Universe (Vishwatma), the Spirit of the Universe, should feel satisfied with my yagna I have done with the language, with the vani, with my writings. He should be happy what I have written, or She should be happy what I have written, and She should now give us- [MARATHI. SOUNDS LIKE, "TO SHONI DYAVE PASAIT"]- and She should come and give the blessings of vibrations". Then he describes you people as beautifully that, he says that, "Come along the forest of Kalpatru" ('Kalpatru' means the tree that gives whatever you want, you see- wishes). And also the sea, full of..."You are the sea"; you see, he has described, "Come along; the seas are full of ambrosia". All kinds of things he had described for you all. And then he says, [SOUNDS LIKE, "HAI CHI APALE SO"]; [UNCLEAR] ("And these people, when they come together, become our relations"). Every word he has described about Sahaja Yoga so beautifully. It's amazing; in the twelfth century [ie 1200s] he sang this song absolutely describing it. [Shri Mataji is refering to the Pasayadan]

So many people have done like that, we can say, with: Lewis has done it, also we can say that William Blake* has done it. But Namadeva's [Shri Mataji may mean Gyaneshwara] description of you people is really very, very beautiful and it is described in such a beautiful poetry- poetry so beautiful. It has personified you people with the Oceans of Ambrosia and the forests of Kalpatrus; see, like that; really it's fantastic. But also, I mean, you have seen that Rabindranath Tagore has talked about our Ganapatipule also. So it has been a kind of a vision for these visionaries (we call them 'drashtras') and they saw all these things, and that's how they have written. And so the song that you are talking also is another vision which is there.

I was surprised that when I read the book on Thomas [the Gospel of Thomas] and the whole thing seems to be nothing but Sahaja Yoga. But they faced such problems, these Gnostics, that the people started calling them heretics, and also said, "This is blasphemy". Even a bishop, sometime later on, said that, "These people should be shot dead because they have no knowledge. They're just talking about this knowledge and all that". So he hid all that treatise, that he had written, in a jar and put it somewhere in Egypt, which was found now after so many years. So you can imagine what was the situation, that time, to talk about knowledge, or about reality. But today it's not so; we can openly talk about it. Nobody can arrest us for that, and nobody can say that we are blasphemy, or doing blasphemy, or heretics. They may say, but they cannot charge us with that. We cannot be arrested, because the Church is not that strong now, thank God.

[A SAHAJA YOGI SAYS: "BY SHRI MATAJI'S GRACE THE CHURCH WILL EVEN BECOME MUCH WEAKER THAN THEY ARE NOW." SHRI MATAJI SAID, 'WE WILL MANAGE' "]
