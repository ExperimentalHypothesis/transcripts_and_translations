Now you have to get up one by one and give it to the uncle. Now because the system has not been put properly, what we can do is to boys must get up, take the things from the girl, and give it to the uncle, and uncle then has to give it to the girl. mama take it and give it to the mama fast be fast.

Now, listen now, the second one is more important, it's rather complicated. Go faster with the coconuts, please. Does the at this time all the mamas must get up.

And give these things in the lap of the girl, like this, in this thing again, all the mamas have to give it to the girl. Not for the signal. Just a minute, just a minute, just a minute. You just listen to the instructions first and we'll give you the signal for doing it. Now, all this has to go to the girl's side on her lap. Now the mothers have to put it in her lap would be better, put it in the lap of the girl. All right? So now it is given to the girl, whatever it is, is her uh her property or everything that represents the the wealth or the lakshmi of the family is given to the girl. And that is given from the mother's side. Because she's the Lakshmi, and she's going away so symbolically the Lakshmi of the house is given this.

So uh. Leo de la smi princier iron depo. No, no, no. The the boys have to give it in the lap of the girls. Now, after doing that, the mother should show the girl the ornaments that are there and make her cover her with the sari. And they, first of all, take out the things. Or even if you do not take out the salis all right, but first of all, take out the things that are meant for the boy. Hello mama vadepore uh. Fran Lepo a la mere the ensuite montrealeppolo. Ma.

Now, when, when they, the ladies, the mothers have taken out the things that are for the boys. These things are to be brought and given to the boys. That's the first thing. The girls should keep quiet with these things in their lap. Now all the other relations of the girls, whatever ornaments they want to give, can give ornaments later, but one by one I'll give you instructions. Don't do it in a hurry. Now first of all, as I said, the mamas have to get up, cross over, and put it in the lap of the girl. Should I do it now? OK. All the mama do is in the lap of the girl. And the girl doesn't do anything.

She just waits until the, until the mother shows up. Mama representing all the mamas. I've also given you Ganesha as present to every boy for the boy and the girl, both of them. We've got 252 are there, so it's it's all right to give both for the boys, all the you sit back at your place. So that would be you come along? You bring the supply. Bring an armful in your laptop. And all the foreigners must get there also. After getting this, the function is over, all the foreigners who have come from the western countries, eastern countries should take one G Ganeshai each. If you only the western you heard.

So. All the boys and all the girls. Remembered the cap's mother, so may I just pass one to each man. No, this is not to be just now because this may be spoiled, we'll have to in the in the bag we'll give them just now or you can give them later when they have got now. The girls, the boys think whatever are to be given for the boys, whatever you want to give to the boys. Now take it out. I have a chain to be given to all the boys. I've got a chain for them. Hello uh male cado for uh le marie argen. Jane for the boys?

Yes, so the mothers should come and tie the chain for the boys. So when we give the signal, not just now when we give the signal of the. Uh no. This is the chair which I have given as a present myself to the boys. What's that but also what is it hurtful hurtful and it's my pool. DJ to foreigners yes are you giving to Indians or let it be all right yes. These are the things I've given to the girls as a wedding present. And also these. Oh, you customised. OK All right.

Just the same for the boys, I, I'm giving them whatever is to be given to the boys apart from that, like someone wants to give the rings and other things should be. Not in. Some people have relations have rings and things have to be done when I give you a signal. First of all, just tie the chain and then whatever our relations are there, they want to give something to the boy. The relations those who want to give something to the world. Sibutala. What's she say? I don't know, he's got a gift for somebody over there.

This mama has for that. All right. Anybody who has after this, there should not be any hurry and scurry. Those who have gifts for the girl or for the boy should give the relations, the friends, or anybody, but don't hurry up just now one by one because it's quite a mess then. See, the girls are sitting with all their things and they should not be disturbed. They have to keep everything inside the packet is better, the girls, so that it is safe. Put everything inside the packet if possible. All the ornaments, everything. Let the mother know. Mothers can help them put everything inside.

Those all the boy ladies who have got the mangalsutra. They should give it to the boys because they have to tie it up so the mothers should take out the magasutras and give it to the boys, and they must keep it safe with them and you must not forget to bring it for the wedding. Hello son quino lilies Lord de Marriage. Well, we didn't know we had to bring presents so we'll give them later on.

That's after marriage. No, this is, this is more direct relations. Did you keep it carefully. These are just the present from the immediate relatives. It's presence. There will be another opportunity later in the day to give them. The other thing is the boys have to be very careful. Not to forget the mangalsutra this evening because this is part of the marriage ceremonial. I say. Now those who.

Now if some people have gold banga sutrast to be given to their bride. These bugalsutras must be given to the boys, all the people relations, those who want to give a gold mangalsutra to the girl, that also must be given to the boys and boys must be very careful.

Whatever you want to give to the girl. The job, the relations also. The relations, close relations.

The close relations, the family who have present for the girl, please, it's now time to give to the girl, for the family, the immediate family, the boys or the relations or goes to the girl, you don't get up, you tell the mama. Mama has 2 games for them. Mama, what gift? You should give it to the mama and mama gives to the girl. But other direct relations can give it to the girl. But the boy, if he wants to give anything. Then they must give it to the mama and the mama should pass it over to the girl. Uh I've got, I've got 51 presents. Am I a direct relation or do I come later? I'm the most.

No. Everybody has given. What about the um the ornaments and the that they have been given. They have been given. No, not yet. All right. Now, where are the ornaments? 51 ornaments. Mm. OK, we'll get them.

We'll need 4 men. On the side where the Indians are, um. Now I'll give you instructions now. What is it you have to have your foot. Take some rest. And I think, uh, not, not just now, I mean after some time because we have to still pass on the ornaments. Now then all the girls should take all these things carefully. The girl's mothers should go with them and the bride bride's sisters, they are important. They should go with the girls. Keep everything carefully.

Take some rest after food, and then. You have to dress up according to the timing because all the girls have to be ready by 6 something and the boys have to be ready at 6 o'clock. Reste uh quasi garde sues monus sebijo a prayer deposeiltro praya Caesar arson refi. Now, uh, the, the bridegroom will have to start from here at 6 o'clock on the horses. But the girls should not get out till the boys are gone. The boys we first come. And then I'll come here for the Gawriujan. By that time, the girls should be brought by the mother. You want them to come to where you live? Why?

Come to. Yes, the procession of the city. Li. Yeah. All right. And then you see they should ladies should be dressed up fully. Like they should have all their saris on with their things on, all their ornaments on. All these things should be done for ladies in the same way, the boys, when they get onto their horses, they should be tied with this. All this should be done for that, the boys, brothers should help them. Lesson re peelle mamaliorola the los colifien pole goripoja in vocals complex mon decorre rabid marriage male lied asatti.

And the mamas and the mothers of the girl and the fathers should prepare an arty. For the Boy who's coming. And that is to be done when the boy comes. He is to be received with and with a after going round the whole thing, I mean after the proced after touching my feet, they go around the place on the horses. at the same time. Can I give these out at the same time let it be. When they'll be getting on the horse, it's better to give them. No, no, just, uh, before that you keep it with you. I'll tell you what you see yourself, what is this? This is for your brides you're giving.

Don't give it to and the other gentlemen. I'll just excuse me. It's beautiful. Subloglena. Except for Jacker and something. This is Don't worry. Dana. Excuse me. Oh You O OK You got the last one I sent you that one. Very good.

Just show him. Another was that 50 or 5151. I gave you the one. That This one again has to be given to the uncle. For don is your mama. And then that one is to be given. To the girl. You have to get up and give it to the girl, and then take the girls with you out from here. All the mothers and the mamas should take the girl. When we give you the signal.

And the. Near by peleka confunuatanahaekarva. Don't do it before I tell you because it's a confusion there. We will give the signal when you have to do it. Don't bi or fiance. The mothers and the sisters, they will escort and make her comfortable and keep her ornaments properly somewhere. When she gets up, she has to wear her sari, her blouse, and everything. Now please slowly get up. Matt no I cross over. Should we announce that the couples eat first, not that they have to kill?

For all the here, it is clear that you let the couples eat first. The couple should not queue, just now the couples, it's a b buffet. So first of all, the mamas of the girl and they should see that they give food to the girl and to the boy. serve them food in the rooms. Yes, they should come take a plate each and take them in the room so they have their food and come back. And the mother should give food to the girls. Actually, in our custom, the mama has to pay for this food. Ha. I'm looking at Mother Day. All right.

So now the, the mothers have to give the food to the girls, make them comfortable, keep all their things all right. And the boys are to be looked after by mamas. You should bring the one plate each, give them food and let them rest. And then, then afterwards the dressing up has to be done by the. Um, so that accounted the best one by the brothers of the boy. I know. In other words, the food is being provided to the couples. No, no, not couples. The girls must be looked after by the mothers, no confusion, and the boys must have their food in their rooms separately by the mamas. The mothers feed the girls and the mamas feed the boys in their rooms separately.

And take down the plates and everything and let them rest. Now the mamas won't meet. The boys till they arrive at the time on the gate where they will do the RT, where they will receive them as bridegrooms. So after getting down from the horses, they'll be received by the mamas. And will be guided down to the places where they have to stand in a queue. So you have to come in the numbers 1234, like that, you have to come and stand in that line and the mamas should provide for the garlets. Now the garlands will be. In the hands of the boys and girls in such a way that the flower garland is first and then another garland behind it, which is a shining garland. uh luminos. All right.

And once that happens, now the mamas can come and sit down. They should stand there. With the garlands sit down sit down. The The With the garlands, the boys should stand in lines and because there are many who are new who have not seen the system, that's what I'm saying. Doc ensuite chakras animerote gas line the clerg lama. Now the organisers should know that time the akhaas must be distributed. Now one thing is that after once, now you are to be married. You'll be tied with a thing in your hand, all of you, the bandage. Once that is tied, you're not to go here and there. It's now you're going to be married.

You can't just run here, then go to the sea or under the tree. No. Keep together. It's very difficult, easy to locate a 51 people. So everything is arranged, but you just do one thing not to run about. Now you are grown up man. You are marrying, be responsible. All the mothers should die kunda for the boys and the mamas for the. Before They get ready. Or after they get rid, actually somebody responsible should do it before it's done, huh.

All right, it would be better when you come here after marriage.

So they have to agree to give the girl. The luxury of the house to the boy, and there are promises to be made. But I will look after your daughter with care. All right, this will be done now. In Sanskrit language, and I need not translate. This is simple as anything that the boys. Have to accept the hand of the girl. The man has to say that I will look after your daughter. This promise has to be done now. That is important that a promise must be given to the parents.

All right, so the father or the mother of the girl or both of them, if they are there, they have to do this ceremony. Now Bla will tell you the procedure. Listen to it carefully. What. It Kalijai. The parents must come forward a little bit on the phone, sit uh uh on the side like Mr. is sitting, the parents. A mama needs to be the the mama should be on one side on the girl's side and uh. Boy's parents should be on the boy's side. Boy's parents on the boy's side, little forward facing me this way. the The boy has to make his hand like this as if he's going to give something.

This is called a goalanjelly, as you call it tan jelly. If that's how you give to someone. So you have to, the boy has to make a hand like this and the girl has to make a hand like this and the. Parents of the girl, the mama of the girl has to put her hands like this on top of the boys and jelly, uh the father or the mama, anyone whosoever. I understand the mama. What if the father is there, well and good if the father is not there, then the mama. Are you on the boys side of the girls? You are on the girl's side, and the mama of the girl has nothing to do just now. This is the bridesmaid have got one just a minute to begin with. The bridesmaid have got one coconut in their hands.

Will they have they put it on top of the Kasha? The bridesmaids. that All right. Kalash has got water. This represents Kundalini. Kalaha represents the mullagara I. The stealla, that is the coconut. Are there? We so. Just a minute.

But yours is so strata. It's just like a plane if you see. All right. I again. I saw. Never now the mother. Of the price. As to take the colour shine and I. And in one hand, the coconut. And now pour the water.

On top of the girl's hand. Which falls into the hands of the boy. Hands have to be crossed, but the girl's hand should be on top of the boy's hand. Now see, it's so significant, that is the shaftti is the power of the Kalaha. Deattara Ah, the power of the colour, the mother has to do. The mother has to pour. Huh, slowly, slowly, very little, very little, just by a little bit sorry should not be spoiled. Be careful with the sari. The mother should look after the sari of the bride. Sorry, be.

Holy. And now now this is the mantra, so the shaft is passing through the girl to the boy. number of I I. You We I I. Kalahari Dewa. Now keep the colour sha down below. The boy has to say 3. It. Now the first reverse was saying that I'm giving you this so that you reach the Brahma state, means you get your realisation ramalo is the realisation. I'm giving you these girls so that all my forefathers may be also realised. With this wish I'm giving you my daughter, so that all my family be blessed with realisation.

All right. Now he says yes, I, I accept the hand of your daughter. All right. So that's how the acceptance has taken place. Now you can take back your hands. Drop the water on the ground. Drop the water on the ground or in the colours. Ground is better. Again, keep back the colours. Cover it with the.

Drop the water, all drop water drop slowly on the graph. Slowly in front like this, just push it like that. Then the boy has to put the left hand on the right shoulder of the girl. I have. To build up my dharma is my basic foundations of. Righteousness And you have to be righteous. Then you have to help me. And also. If I want to have. The subjects for the Sir, our families, you have to produce children.

And thirdly you have to Help me inajo. Now see the right hand is Shri chakra, where you're putting your left hand, getting the energy from your wife, saying that you must help me to be righteous. Because she is the one who is the foundation, and she has to behave in a righteous manner so that the man learns righteous and religious behaviour. Unvarani tin Videla nati charaminati charaminatira. Now the boy says 3 type nati charaminati charami, nati charami, meaning that what you say, I will do that. Well. What. Now the boy says that I will not. Be so. Uh, what, uh, I'll not respass.

What you say as far as religion or Serio is concerned and about the children, I will not overrule. Now you all have got. put The boy now has to promise the girl that he will abide by religious and righteous ways. Keeping a very salivable life, it is quite. And controlling all his senses properly, leading a life that is ideal for surgery. He has to tie. Uh, there is one String you all have. Which is the essence of the mothers as a promise to the girl and that the girl has to try on. Right The boy should die on the left and the girl should die on the right. I What's the boy.

OK Mama I'll put about. The boy has to die on the left hand of the girl and the girl has to try on the right hand. See now, because the girl is the left side and the boy is the right side of one person. What thing is ready to call it that right place. I That's true Oh, that that. Exactly. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Now this rice is coming to you.

You should take it and put it. The, the boy must put it on the girl's head and the girl must put it on the ball. These are the blessings of the mother. Like My mother should have that. I came in, you get. It's not something So you're gonna get one. Sala. Simply, simply, I love you keep it in the hand. I. Yeah I Yeah I don't know. No.

No. Yeah I Yeah But. I. Now this is, these are all symbolic, uh, methods of tying up the thread. The symbolic thing is a promise. See, uh, I'm gonna. marriage have to be such that should be able to be married. You need not be very rich people that you can give a ring or something, just with a thread, if you are married with auspicious men, you have to know that you are married to that person and that you have to remain always very faithful and kind to each other. He just in the test, so now. As you right There is one thing is that now you have got these uh.

This rise, these are auspicious things representing the mother earth's blessings to you. You should now the boy should put on the girl's head. The girl should bend her head and put this blessing her that this is the blessing of the mother earth which I've got and I'm giving it to you. Just the boy should do it first, should do it first on top of the head of the girl. Just like this. That's all. Now the girl has to do it. On the boy and the girl. She's on the first car. On the socara vibrating.

Uh, these, uh, auspicious. Right are just to bless the other. Part of your being because you two are one now and culminated now. The Has to tie the manga sutra. The mongal Mogal means auspicious. sutra means a thread in the neck. So first, you have got one which I have given you is in silver that you put it first, the sutra. And then the second one, whatever you have of gold. Now some of you have also got rings. After doing that, you can put the exchange rings also.

And the boys, uh, mother, mother-in-law and the mama and all those. need not open. The bigger one, I've got some very big ones, so you need not open. Be careful, that's all. Yes, now, are you ready? With which I have given you to begin with. Now put it in the The Now the gold ones. If you have it has to be done carefully by the hands but mostly the bigger ones can be put now if the gold ones. If you have got the gold numbers. That's it.

To. Now the mama, now we start. Now that tied together. How do we believe that the mama are there? And they will tie the end of the. Scarf that you're wearing the boys at the end of the sari. The Mother and the mama of the girl can help mama of the boy. I should be done. I thank you. that.

Let's stay together. You nice together now. Do. I love you. Now we have to worship the parts. Fire is the one that gives us digestion. This is the part that gives us energy. If we don't have energy in the body, we can not work it out. Also, fire represents all the. So the fire is to wash it because the fire could not be too much or too less.

The fire should be such that the fire that you get now should take you. To the light of spirit, the fire should not exceed more or should not be less. It should be in the centre and also fire is the bar which is surrounded by. So the principle of the primordial master should guard your fire. By which you should not become people of hot temper. And the it should be. In the Maradas, the boundaries of good behaviour. Among yourselves you must guard it as a secretary and should not spoil your relations by firing at each other and shouting at each other, saying hard things, saying cruel things, sarcastic things, but try to think something of nice like fire also can be used for cooking. Now the best way to attend to your husband or to deserve the affection of your husband is to do good cooking. So where we use the fire for cooking to please the husband, that means in proper proportion, the fire is used in our auspicious way.

We cook for the husband and offer him the food which is again digested by his fire, so his fire is quenched. And he's kind to us. Now this has to be done wisely. If a girl is not wise, she cannot handle her husband, so she has to be a wise person, and the husband has to feel satisfied with what she's doing for him and looking after him, and there should be a mutual give and take and loving, affectionate understanding. That's the reason now we are praying to fire to give us all the blessings of the fire. Now the another blessing of the fire is that it makes you clean in the same way as if you put the gold which is mixed up and is confused sort of a personality, then it burns off all that. We have used fire for taking out bahas, for taking out all our lethargic temperaments and. All kinds of uh uh ideas of depression, whatever takes us out from life. So this way we perceive fire that it should give us that life by which we should work in a dignified manner and in a way that is like a beacon. It should be like a beacon to guide the path of others of surgery.

We got this one. I. Uh, ladies, the ladies must look after. I think Indian ladies should look after the fire part. But our men are not so good. Ah, you did. I. Thank you. I. I Oh. I.

No the. I don't. I. Every Maybe your sal is all right on the file. There. Hm. We didn't go I Yeah. If that he so it will be if you don't talk. Oh. I tape.

The. The boy should make a hand like this and the boy should make uh put it in the boy's uh uh and the boys under you put the angle of the girl. We like it. Naja. Any boy, uh, or the brother of the of the girl or the mama? Mama. with the I said put a little bit in the in the underly of both of these people. These lis are kept in front. Just wait till I tell you. Just wait till we tell you.

Ah, now put it on the fire, both the hands. All right. One more. The light, the mama said the brothers must cook up. Oh, got it. By the I know. The first is the first is uh for the asking for the enlightened life for both of them. The Second one is that our lights should show us the places. Thank Now the 3rd 1 you put the rice. 3rd time.

we were. And. let us preserve and look after the family. Outside your mouth. Put it down. Have you put it? All right. Now tell me. I can put happiness and joy. It should not be exclusive private life as people have it.

It has to be private when it has to be normally, but whenever it is to be shared, one should not sort of get mixed up that we are married, we should be separately and all that. That is the thing when we are together in collectivity, we are sharing with others. Fully 5th time. Now put it. This time again. Put the hands of the. I. You What the Now the last one is to say that God has created this universe, not only for us, but everybody has to live in this unit. And so our married life should add more to that understanding of peace and bliss. And we must live with peace and bliss among ourselves so that we create a unit of peace and bliss and our Creator will be happy to see that he has created such a harmonious couple which is creating harmony in the world.

And harmony with the rest of the universe in the sense, the ecological balancing and all that so that we should not have no fight with the nature. And understanding the nature's job, we should act in that manner that there should be no imbalances in life. May God bless you. Uh I. Now both the husband and wife have to get up and go round the fire that you have hold the hands. A carefully not to trample over the rice that is put there. Carefully the girl will reach down and holding each other's hands. I, I. I go around the fire so that you worship the fire. You have promised the fire now. So the fire has promised you also.

Go round the fire. Go around the fire and be seated. Once, once, once only be seated. So you have now. You have to say namaskar to the agni as your mother is also at the devata. So say Namaskar to your agni devata. That is the fire within you is symbolically expressed outside. What about lights this side also, none of these people are taken up. Now for the rest of the thing, you should take these people photographs. Y'all be.

No. that And the last most important thing is called a the. I Uh, now we have got. These are the 7 things we have to say when we walk on these 7 mounds of rice, promising each other by letting. Top up just a minute. Pylaine, it's just a Pylaine. Uh, that, huh. Ah. The 1st 3 are to be done. When the girl leaves the boy, and the last 4 are to be done when the boy leaves the girl, so they change places after 3.

They change places after 3, we'll do it in Sanskrit, 1 verse, and thus it will be translated in English by one. So now your stand up it's all right, fire is not needed anymore now, it's all right. Be careful of stand up properly to all the other people's relations must stand up and help the girl. The girl must put down her head carefully and go round the fire without disturbing the. Others. Now the girl must put her foot. On the first mound. Right foot Footla meaning the toe, the big toe on the first bound of the rise, which is on your left side. And hold the hand of the match. Now, standing there, she's promising.

Yeah. Now just stand there till I tell you on the first one. Nobody should stand with the back towards me, please. The Yeah. Yes, all others should move out a little bit so that they Yes, please. All right, now let's have it. A Now wait till Boy, uh, he did sit in English, huh. This is what the bride. I will help to keep your mul in order. You hand over all wealth which is in your possession.

I will take care of those things. You should only eat the food that is cooked by me or your brothers and sisters, and if taken outside the house, you will vibrate it. I will be loyal to you and you will be loyal to me. We mean all that is the spiritual and the emotional wealth means mostly the emotional wealth means you should not uh fitter away your emotions with other, other women. Your emotional relationship is with me, is sacred, is with me, and the other relations like brothers and sisters' relations are different. But as husband and wife, this is our world and money should be kept with the wife so that you just don't spend the money, but it should be understood that the wife doesn't spend any money without asking the husband. I must do it. Now you have to rub off the mound with your finger with your toe, the big toe with your big toe so that You have accepted the first condition of the wife, so now the lady has to rub it off. Now rubbing is just to. That's Just put your hand flick flick it to one side with your big toe.

Yeah, on one side, not both sides, one side. All right, now put your big toe. The girls have to put the big toe on the second mark. P and Yeah The bride says again, I will do all household work with my physical and spiritual powers. I will live with love and affection and will obey you. You should help me in my work and I will help you in the work of Sahajoga. All right, now with this say you again, do the same thing with the mouth. So that you have said what you had to say. On one side, yeah. Now, now the 3rd 1, you put your toe on the 3rd 1. one was Hey.

The bride says, I will keep my Lakshmi chakra in order and you will respect my Lakshmi tatwa. This will keep your Lakshmi tatwa in order too. You should give account of all you bring home. Nothing will be hidden. This you should understand that a woman, no money should be hidden from the woman and the woman should not hide any money from the man, and she should look after her girl Lakshmimi, she should be a woman who can be worshipped. You see, she has to be a Lakshmi of the girl. Lakshmi, she is to be a woman of that category that she is worshipped and when there's such a k is worshipped, there is the residence of the gods and goddesses in that place, otherwise it's a haunted place. So now just rub off the the one the boys. And now the girl again puts her feet, feet on the 4th 1, the girl, guard, the girl, the girl puts. How left hand, left hand.

Like that. The boys want change places. Now the boys who were on the right of the girl should now come to the left of the girl. And come forward in such a way that the girl can put her toe on the 4th mark. Now the girl is led by the man. See, now he accepts her conditions, and now he needs her life. In a proper married life, the man should be the kinetic force, and the woman should be the force of life. The man should lead the. And the wife should be led by. Man, but man has to be wise and respect his wife and her desires and love her is to be judged.

Man needs her. Into rightness, into goodness, into the part of urge. OK Report one Who I. Yeah. Now the groom says I will give you happiness and peace with love and affection, but you will also have to think about my happiness and my peace. You should not go outside without my permission, and I will tell you when I go outside. I will not discuss or think about the past, and you will not discuss or think about the past. And you should not mention anything about your past. Past is lost in. We are now. Forget it, never did it that you did that and you did that, never remember that.

Start the new life of lear now rub it off. Now come forward and the girl should put her big toe on the 5th 1. yeah. Uh in the way. yeah The groom says. You should take care of me and my children, and you should respect and welcome other Sahaja Yoga brothers and sisters when they come to our house. All right, now rub off. This one, the 5th 1. Now go forward and put your big toe on the 6th 1. no. Oh. rose and The groom says If I commit any mistakes while doing sad yoga, you should excuse me, and I will excuse you.

You have to forgive it either. This is the 6th chakras Christ where you have to forgive each other. Forgive is the best way not to think about it, but to forgive. Otherwise, how can we ask for forgiveness from God? So this is the 6th chapter, very important. Forgive and forget. And every night I would say before sleeping, uh, uh, in the room, you all should finish off whatever has happened and finish the subject completely and start afresh every night. There should be no discussion as to what wrong has gone wrong, uh, but what good has done good. May God bless you. Now rub it up.

Now the 7th is very important. Put your finger there. To then now go forward. The boys must lead the girls now. Just uh boys should be forward. You must remember the boys should not be backwards. You must become men, and leave the women. It's all upside down that we try. To be led by women is good, but women really, really control the men by that. Those women who know that it's better to make her to feel that he needs to use the best bet.

OK, all right, now on the 7th 1, you put your toe now. Uh I. And so both Husband and wife say Sriaddi Shakti Mataji Mahadevi has put us in holy bandan by our marriage, and this is a very great fortune by this act of Sri Mataji is Mahayagya.

We will have to take some time for the arrangements.

that. I've been. Yeah. you slow. I'll point out too much. No. It's not good. I, I don't know what she wanted to do. I don't now. What's happening here.

On the. the rub coming over here. I get the drug coming over here. Thank I'm getting the grub coming over. Uh, could the person holding the security room key please come to the microphone? The person holding the security room key, please come. What they're gonna eat. No. Now we have one custom just teasing each other sort of custom one so. But uh.

Price range couldn't Uh, not The bridesmaid has to open the knot and you have to give her something like 15 â‚¹2 just as a token and uh she. She insist on more insist on more that's a joke. That's a joke. Then the second thing is that the girl. The boy has to give a morsel in the mouth of the bird, and while giving that, you have to make a nice couplet in which you put the name of your wife. Say for example, uh, it is, uh, say my name. Then my husband would say something like uh. Uh, For example, a couplet. Which is not. Yeah Uh, in Marrati, I know, but in English it's difficult to say so or in English it is something you have to say that, uh.

I love my wife so and so said in my life. Uh, and, and if it the same, uh, this is the second one. I love my wife, my, uh, in English there's nothing like really ending because she sang a song of la la la. Nothing like that. So you have to take some sort of a couplet and take the name of the wife and then take the uh the then the wife has to give a morsel to the husband and take the name of the husband. Normally we are not supposed to just call our wife uh by name, but that they do nowadays. Because men are easily they give up all these things, but the women even now don't call the husband's name. They will call some like my daughter's father or something like that. They will never take, but in Marrasha, uh, it's a very funny custom that some people even don't say that, uh, they say that, uh. Uh, in the houses, house there are pes, you see where the, uh, where the people have the goats and the turbans, see, so she said, uh, uh, if somebody goes and ask, uh, who's in the house, so she said the turban of the peg has gone up.

You're not supposed, it's very respectful way, you see, not to take your husband but to say that that one on the pay. According to them more respectable. Uh, my brother will tell you another joke. You see, in Maharashtra we have an item of eating a sweet dish known as Shankar pie. The name of that dish is the name of that item is Shankar pie. Now this lady, her husband's name was Shankar. So one day the people were invited and people asked us what the menu was, so she said that it is his pie. He could not take, she could not take the name Sanjay Pare Bonole. There's so many jokes on this, you see, but despite all that, the women don't take the names of the husbands, but nowadays the husbands have become very modern, so they just start calling the names of the wives without feeling any, uh, uh, inhibition about it, and they are not shy people. You think they're not so shy as the women now.

So they are very easily uh they give up. The I So now they, they, I hope you all have made some couplets. Something you have to take the name of the god that I love such and such person very much or something whatever way you can say. Now you have to make a morsel. The boy has to make a morsel, OK, haka. The boy has to make the mors. Yes, the man has to make the m, huh. And now, take the name of the girls. Lovely. I love you.

It's all the mischievous stuff. Now, now it's too small. Make a big one, and that's it. Make a big one. It's a joke. It's a joke. No I do not consider.

All right, let's have it. 123. And now you have to take the name loudly loudly one by one, come along. Get the microphone. I have one. I get it.
