Devi Puja, "Don't get frustrated", Hotel Cumulus Kaisaniemi, Helsinki (Finland), 17 August 1989

1989-0817 Devi Puja, Helsinki (Finland), “Don’t get frustrated”Here we are in Finland and hell, competing with itself a little bit because it’sthe end of the line. All the problems come and settle in the end. And that’show we see here that there are lots of negative forces that have beenworking very nicely, and also there are so many seekers. So, it’s more of anattraction for them to come here and attack the seekers.When you take to Sahaja Yoga, you have to know that Sahaja Yoga is likethe light coming in your life and the light which comes gradually shows youeverything that you have.For example, you are carrying the snake in your hand. Somebody says,“Throw away the snake.” You are in the darkness; you think it’s a rope. So,you don’t want to throw away the snake. But the light comes in, you see thesnake in your hand, you get a fright and you throw it away. And somebodymight just run away thinking that the snake has come from Sahaja Yoga.The people who come to Sahaja Yoga also will be like that. They’ll come toSahaja Yoga, and they will be upset about themselves that, “Oh, God, thisis my condition,” and they will not like to face the reality and will run away.So, you have to be very patient with them and careful. A little complicationpiece.If somebody is coming to Sahaja Yoga, let’s say – if he is coming fromcomplete darkness or from complete ignorance. Maybe he’s already halfmad. You will not know what his mental condition is. Maybe he is sufferingfrom some sort of a horrible disease; it could be cancer, it could beanything. Because if he had been to gurus, there could be anything. Andmaybe they are not suffering yet from that. Or they are suffering so muchthat they can’t feel it. It’s very complicated.One should know the first principle of Sahaja Yoga: Never get disappointed.Sometimes you have to work hard. I’ve worked on people for twenty-fourhours and I found they are good for nothing. They’re just like stones. If I’dworked on stones, at least I would have created a Ganesha out of them.You find there is nothing has come out of all that work that’s important.There is nothing to feel frustrated in Sahaja Yoga. Whatever we have to do,we have to do. We shouldn’t worry about the fruits of it. One of the mainprinciples of Gita is: Karmanye vadhikaraste (Though the karma is there,but not to worry for it). Phaleshu ma kadachan (we should not worry aboutthe fruits).So, that will keep you on the right track. Otherwise you might get frustratedand I have known people, how they have been breaking their heads andone day I said, “Why are you so much worried?” It happened in Boston.They said, “Mother, do You mean to say, ‘all of them are going to go tohell?’ ”I said, “I don’t say that.” But I would say that at least you should not give uphopes. Till the end we should try to save them. And things will work out.And it has started working out there.In the same way, we have to know that in the beginning you never getmany Sahaja yogis. Never, whatever you may try. Even in India I startedwith one Sahaja yogi. Because we have to have a proper foundation, wehave to have proper people. Also the Divine doesn’t want us to have toomany people. Because there would be just useless people joining us.We have to know that, first of all, we have to have solid, good Sahaja yogis.And those who call themselves Sahaja yogis have to build up themselvesin such a manner that they are very good Sahaja yogis, there are nocatches and their attention is good.First, once they are established, then we can build up the whole thingaround them. But otherwise it so happens that if the foundation is weak, thewhole building can go down. So, we have to have few Sahaja yogis. Wecan’t afford to have many. Though you will see when I go there’s a floodand thousands will be there.Everywhere. Italy when I went, Milano, they had never seen my face; theynever knew who I was. But the whole hall was full. I don’t know how manythousand people and you had to just wade through it. Everybody was soenthusiastic. I could see the future also.So, we got about ten people out of all that. Then ten people more, tenmore. That’s how it started gathering. Because since Sahaja Yoga, youhave to become something, becoming is the problem. If you don’t becomesomething, you are no good as a Sahaja yogi.This is a very big problem. You should never get frustrated, never get upsetabout it. If anybody says anything to you, after all he is blind, so it doesn’tmatter. Have pity on him and don’t get angry at him at all. There may besome fanatics who are against Sahaja Yoga naturally because they arefanatics. They are not wanting reality.So, all such things will happen. You will have to show your patience and acomplete forebearance. That’s very important. Never to get frustrated.Remember what we have. We should try to perfect it. The more you’llperfect it, the better it will be for our basic things, our foundation, which hasto be very strong. And once the foundation is strong, then you can goahead with it.But just now, to begin with, you should not talk about Me much. Just saythat, “She is an ordinary human being.” Or at the most, if you don’t want totell lies, you can just say that, “She is all right, we shouldn’t discuss that, letus discuss something else. Let us know about science. That’s better. Thenwe can know Her.” You say, “Keep it for the further discovery.”If you go on making them understand that it is for their benevolence, fortheir own energy and their own maneuvering, they should keep it tothemselves, they will be happy and not to tell them about Me much.Now the miracles or such things of Sahaja Yoga should not be described ortalked to them. Like Heidrich talked to them about the photographs, tothese two persons, but they have been doing Sahaja Yoga. But normally,never show them any miraculous photographs. Because they will alwayssay, “You have managed it and it has been some kind of a maneuvering.”For that you should limit yourself to some things like telling about SahajaYoga, about Kundalini, about all these things. But about Me or aboutmiraculous photographs and all miraculous things, you should not talk.Keep it in a general way.Also, you shouldn’t say, “It’s a puja,” and things like that. Because very fewnew people can come to puja. Everybody need not know about puja. Butwhat you can tell them is that there are chakras, they are to be cleaned outand they are to be kept in balance. And you have to raise the Kundalini,how to raise the Kundalini, and you can say that, “Just now let’s useMother’s photograph for the time being. But later on, when we are free,independent guru beings first, then you don’t have to use Mother ́sphotographs.” Then they’ll never give up. And they’ll fight for it.And thirdly, they are afraid of collectivity. So, you have to say that,“Because we are not collective, that’s why we are frightened, and if goodpeople all collect together, if righteous people...” Like that if you talk, theywon’t be afraid of you. Only the thugs combine, only the thieves combine.The good people don’t combine. So, we have to combine good people.So, then they will understand that part, and they won’t be angry. Otherwise,if you say, “We have to have collectivity,” they must be thinking you are upto something. That will be the suspicion. It will always be because nobodycombines for love. If they combine together, they only combine for what youcall is the fight, or the hatred, or could be some sort of a sinister stuff.Otherwise they never combine.If you say, “We are for love,” they’ll go away, “Oh, we know this kind. Thestory we know, this love.” So, if you have to really bring them round throughdiscussion and argument, you must, first of all, be very good at SahajaYoga. That means that – of course the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is toovast – but you should be in such a mood and such a state and such apersonality that they should see there is something special about thisperson. And then they will accept you much better. That’s what we have todo and not to get frustrated. It’s a fun, that’s all. If we don’t get this, all right,we’ll have another one, doesn’t matter.And now I’ve been going to countries and countries and countries. The firstone I went to was Italy, which today is a great Sahaja yogi nation. I stayedin a hotel, like this and Mr. Gavin had arranged to stay in a hotel and therewas going to be a press conference and there was a very huge meeting forwhich also I paid for a big hall in there.So there, with me was Gregoire’s first wife. We went down. And they gaveus the room and all that was nice, and I stayed there. But when in theevening we went down, not a single soul from the press and not a singlecockroach even for the meeting. And before that I, of all the things, wentout to do the postering.And she was so worried that, “If they catch us” and “something willhappen.” I said, “Nobody’s going to catch you. Take it from Me. Just likethat we will do.” I went and did all the postering, because we were the onlypeople there. Despite that, not a single soul came in. Not a single one. It’sall right. It’s fun. It happened that time so I could tell you today for you tolaugh.They’ll realize it later on in Sahaja Yoga that they didn’t know where to go,what they have been doing, how they were stupid and they’ll enjoy itthemselves. So, all humans are important in Sahaja Yoga. Very important.Because that gives a variety and an interesting theme.Everything has to be taken as fun. I wish you people could completelyunderstand this and relax completely on this point. Never get frustrated. Ifsomebody is not all right, doesn’t get vibrations, you should just smile alittle bit and, “All right, next time.”May God bless you.
