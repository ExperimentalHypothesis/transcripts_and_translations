Shri Devi Puja

So here we are in Finland and that's... are begetting itself a little bit, because is the end of land, you see, so all the problems come and settle in the end, you see? And that's how we've see here, there are lots of negative forces that have been working very nicely, and also there aren't so many seekers. So it's more attraction for them to come here and attack the seekers. So now when you take to Sahaja yoga, you have to know that Sahaja yoga is like the light coming in your life. And the light which comes gradually shows you everything that you have. For example, you are carrying the snake in your hand. Somebody says, "Throw away the snake!" you see. You are in the darkness, you think it's a rope. So you don't want to throw away the snake. But the light comes in, you see the snake in your hand, you get afraid, you throw it away. You get afraid. And somebody might just run away, thinking that the snake has come from Sahaja yoga. So the people who come to Sahaja yoga also will be like that. They'll come to Sahaja yoga, and they will be upset about themselves, "Oh god, you see, I am in this condition!" And they will not like to face the reality, will run away. So you have to be very patient with them. [I HAVE/AM?] A little complication piece. So if somebody is coming to Sahaja yoga, say, he is coming from complete darkness, from complete ignorance, you see. Maybe he's already half mad. You will not know, what his mental condition is. Maybe he is suffering from some sort of a horrible disease, could be cancer, could be anything. Because he would have been to gurus, this, that, there could be anything. And maybe they are not suffering yet from that. Or they are suffering so well that they can't heal it. So it's very complicated. So one should not - first of all - Know, first principle of Sahaja yoga: "Never get disappointed!" Never get disappointed! Sometimes we have to work hard. I've worked on people for twenty-four hours and I found they are good for nothing. Just like stones. If I worked on stones, at least I would have created the Ganesha out of them. You find there is nothing, nothing has come out of that, all that work of puja. So there is nothing to feel frustrated in Sahaja yoga. It's our... whatever we have to do, we have to do, we shouldn't worry about the fruits of it. It's one of the main principles of Gita is: [INDIAN LANGUAGE] Though the karma is there, but not to be thought. [INDIAN LANGUAGE] "We should not worry about the fruits." And that's what it is. So that will keep you on the right track. Otherwise you may get frustrated. And I have known people, how they have been breaking heads and... So one day I said, "Why are you so much worried?" See, it happened in Boston. They said "Mother, do You mean to say, 'All of them are going to go to hell'?" I said, "I don't say that. But that's hope. [THAT'S GATE?]" But I would say that at least you should not give up hopes. Till the end we should try to save them. And things would work out. And it has started working out there. In the same way, we have to know that in the beginnig you never get many sahaja yogis. Never, whatever you may try. Even in India I started with one sahaja yogi. Because we have to have a foundation, proper foundation, you have to have proper. Also, Divine doesn't want us to have too many people. Because there would be just useless people joining us. So we have to know that first of all, we have to have solid, good sahaja yogis. And those who call them for sahaja yogis have to build up themselves in such a manner that they are very good sahaja yogis and there are no catches, nothing. And their attention is good. First ones they are established, then we can build up the whole thing above them. But otherwise it so happens that if the foundation is weak, the whole building can go down. So we have to have few sahaja yogis. We can't afford to have many. Though you will see when I go - like deflected, then thousands they will be there. Everywhere. I mean it's not... Italy I went, Milano... They have never seen my face, they have never known who I was. But the all hall was full. I don't know how many thousands people. And you had to just wait through it. Everybody was so enthusiastic. I could see the future also. So we got about ten people out of all that. Then ten people more, ten more. That's how it started gathering. Because since Sahaja yoga, you have to become [UNCLEAR]. Becoming is the problem. If you don't become something, you are no good in the Sahaja yoga. So, this is a very very big problem, should never get frustrated, never get upset about it. If anybody says anything to you, after all he is blind, so doesn't matter. Have pity on him and don't get angry [ABOUT IT?]. There are maybe some fanatics, somethings, you see, they are against Sahaja yoga naturally. Because they are fanatics, they are not wanting reality. So all such things will happen. You will have to show your patience and a complete forbearance. That is very important. Never become frustrated. Remember we have, we should try to perfect it. The more you'll perfect it, the better it will be for our basic things, our foundation, which has to be very strong. And once the foundation is strong, then you can go ahead with it. But just now to begin with, you should not talk about Me much. You just say, that, "She is the ordinary human being, like person the most." If you don't want to tell lies, you can just say that, "All right, She is all right, we shouldn't discuss that, let us discuss something else. Let us know about science. That's better. Then you see, then we know Her", like that, you see. Just keep it for the further discovery. If you go on making them understand that it is for their benevolence or their own energy and their own maneuvering, they should keep it to themselves, they will be happy. And not to tell them about Me much. And the miraculous things of Sahaja yoga should not be described or talked. Like Heidrich talked to them about the photographs with these two persons, but they have been doing Sahaja yoga. But normally, never show them any miraculous photographs. Because they will always say, "You have managed it and you try to be with it sort of a... kind of a... maneuvering." For that I would say that... [ASIDE:] Smoke is not all right. So, you should limit yourself to some things. Like telling about Sahaja yoga, about Kundalini, about all these things. But about Me or about miraculous photographs and all miraculous things you should not talk. Keep it in a general way. And also you shouldn't say, "It's a puja," and things like that. Because very few people can come to puja, you know that. So everybody need not know about puja, need not know about things. But what you can tell them is that there are chakras, they are to be cleaned out and they are to be kept in balance. And we have to rise the Kundalini, how to rise the Kundalini, also get advanced. And you say that, "Just now let's use Mother's photograph for the time being. But later on, we are becoming, we are free independent guru-beings first, then you don't have to use MotherÂ´s photographs." Then they'll never give up. Isn't it? So, all they'll fight for it! And thirdly, they are afraid of collectivity. So you have to say that, "Because we are not collective, that's why we are frightened, and if good people all collect together, if righteous people..." Like that if you talk, they won't be afraid of. You see, now, only the thugs combine with, only the thieves combine. The good people don't combine. So we have to combine good people. So then they will understand that part, and they won't be angry. Otherwise, if you say, "We have to have collectivity", they must be thinking, "They are up to something." That will be the suspicion. It is always! Because you'll, you only see that nobody combines for love. If they combine together, they only combine for what you call, is the fight. Or the hatred, or could be some sort of a sinister stuff, you see. Otherwise they never combine. If you say, "We are for love," they'll tell, "Oh, we know this kind, the story we know, this love." So if you have to really bring them round through discussion and argument, you must, first of all, be very good to Sahaja yoga. That means that, of course the knowledge of Sahaja yoga is too vast, but you should be in such a mood and such a state and such a personality, that they should see that there is something special about this person. And then they will accept you much better. All right? That's what we have to do and not to get frustrated. It's a fun! It's just fun. That's all! We don't get this, all right, we have other one. Doesn't matter! And now I've been going to countries and countries and countries, now I would say that first venue I went to, Italy, - which is today is a great Sahaja yogi nation - I stayed in a hotel, like this. And Mr. Gavin had arranged to stay in a hotel and there was going to be a press conference. And there a very huge meeting for which also I paid for a big hall. Literally. So where we were there, with me was Gregoire's first wife. Venda. And they gave us the, of course, room and all that was nice, and we stayed there. But when in the evening we went down, not a single soul from the press and not a single cockroach even for the meeting! And before that we got, I for the things went out to do the postering! And she was so worried that, "If catch us and something will happen." I said, "Nobody going to catch you. [TAKE IT with Me?]. Just like we will do." I went and did all the postering, because we were the only people there. So this is how it is. Despite that, not a single soul, who came in. Not a single soul. It's all right. This was fun, you see. It happened that time, so I could tell you today to you to laugh. So that is how. They'll real..., they'll realize it later on in Sahaja yoga. Gradually they [THEY WILL BE KNOW] [THAT FOR] they have been doing, how they were stupid. How they were. And they'll enjoy it to themselves. So all humans are important in Sahaja yoga. Very important. Because that gives a variety and an interesting theme. So everything has to be taken as fun. I wish everybody could completely understand this, and relax completely on this point. Never get frustrated. If somebody is not all right, doesn't get vibrations, you should just smile a little bit, "All right, next that will be." All right? So may God bless you!
