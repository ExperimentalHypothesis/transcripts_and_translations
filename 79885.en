Talk to Sahaja Yogis

Talk Language: Hindi, Marathi | Translation (Hindi to English) - Draft, Translation (Marathi to English) - Draft

Shri Mataji: My pranams to all Sahaja Yogis. Today morning, on seeing you all in such a tapasvita [tapasya/penance]; on one hand, as a Mother I felt bad that you all had to undergo so much trouble. But on the other hand, it must be understood that Sahaja Yoga is now moving to the next level. Getting realisation has now become sahaj. It is difficult to believe that so many can now get realisation. Going forward Sahaja Yoga has kept on growing to such a state that even one Sahaja Yogi can give realisation to anyone; give them the experience of truth. He has formidable shakti and he knows all of Shri Vidya, Shuddha Vidya [pure knowledge of the Divine].

You will find so many sages and saints who, despite being very great do not know this Shri Vidya. Thus, Sahaja Yoga has now reached at a very high state. But whenever something grows too fast and wide, it should also become deep. If it does not get that depth, then the Power that is in the expansion, that becomes somewhat weak. That is why, on the start of this day, which is Dev Diwali, you all had to do a form of tapasya [penance]. We can say everyone was in tapasya anyway. Or we can say in joy on your faces, as soon as I came. Everyone suffered a little, even children. But hardships have to be borne. To go deep, hardships have to be borne. And they are going to start now. Means, you will not have bodily hardships. Nor mental.

But now some tapasya will have to be done. Without that going deeper is going to be difficult. Being at a high level is not going to be acceptable. Sahaja Yoga has multiple benefits, so many benefits. “Our father became alright, mother became alright, the children became alright, the home became alright, got jobs – everything is excellent, we are all well” – all that is done now. “Yoga kshema” is done; we have come up to that point. Now, what next? Now the next has to be earned. And for that, some effort, some tapasya is required. It has started. Sahaja Yogis should know this – “yerya gabalyache kaam navhe” [this work is not for the lazy or inept]. “Yerya gabalyache kaam navhe”. Hard work is required. Meditation is required. Hard work is required. And complete willingness is required. Without that, it cannot be managed.

That is called as consolidation. And if that consolidation does not happen with Sahaja Yoga, remaining half-baked – then further progress will be difficult. We look at everything short-term. “Today, my father’s health is not alright, that one’s health is not alright; this should be done; that should be done. But what depth have I acquired?” Now you will be surprised that in a city like London, when I talked about this subject – all the folks in London, at four in the morning, in a city like London; London – all Sahaja Yogis, in all ashrams, after taking bath and puja, would sit down for meditation.

Chitta [attention] should first be corrected. Chitta should come in line first. Chitta should be concentrated. It must be fixed. With hard work – two, two hours. Started cleansing themselves with two, two hours of hard work. Now you will say, “Mataji, they need it. We have lived in the land of Bharat, we are yogis.” We have some pride about that that Hindustani, that means, Bhartiya are people who have earned some special punya. Even if your collected store is large, the progress still has to be seen. You cannot rely on that store alone. Hard work is needed. Everyone has to do it individually. Should not stay superficially. And this thing has started from today; it should be understood. As such, there was no major trouble or anything. But a kind of inner attention, longing. And in that longing, whatever we are going to need, whatever is going to happen to us; we should have the power to bear that.

Many a time I give you the example – that when a seed sprouts, the beginning is made from the root. And the root starts establishing. How it gets established should be seen. It has that intelligence. That small tip of the root has that much intelligence. How it has to penetrate inside. Now suppose there is a stone in the way, without going besides the stone or fighting it, it goes around a little and coils around it. And holds onto it. The stone. How much wisdom that little tip has. Such wisdom. This wisdom should come to Sahaja Yogis. That our sprouts have to take root deep inside. Then this work can be accomplished very nicely. So it all depends on you now. And it should be done. Tapasya should begin. Now Mataji is here, heard all the prayers, everything is done. Let the children be alright, let everything be alright. Now what next? Why should all this be done? What is all this preparation for? This preparation is for the journey ahead. And to enjoy this journey, all of you must do tapasya. Increase your tapasvita.

Now if I hear somewhere that “Mataji, this Sahaja Yogi of yours treats his mother very badly. He shouts a lot or, his attention is more on women, he runs after money.” Means, what kind of recognition am I going to get from this? Neither will you nor will Sahaja Yoga. Instead by looking at you, people say that “This man’s life has changed; he has become so dignified, become so loving, has so much forbearance. He never thinks ill of others, such a positive man. There is so much beauty in his speech.” If people say this, then I will feel that Sahaja Yoga has truly sorted out and chosen a lamp that is illuminated. Otherwise, people will fall into greater darkness because of you. “Are these Sahaja Yogis? Then we do not want such a Sahaja Yoga. How can they behave this this?” Therefore, how many people are receiving your love, how many people have you given joy, whether you are able to talk politely or not, what is your behaviour – people are watching everything. This should be remembered.

It can be said that people are watching Sahaja Yogis with a hawk’s eye how Sahaja Yogis are behaving. What is the behaviour. Still the same behaviour, still entangled with money, filching money – then what is this? You will not be able to digest it – I had told you at the start itself, when you came to Sahaja Yoga – you will not be able to digest it.  You will be ruined. So why not take to the straight path. That will be benevolent to everyone. Everyone will benefit, it will be benevolent to all, the whole world will receive this benevolence – it is such a great thing. Then why go after this unnecessary thing that will ruin families of all. Instead, everyone should benefit, the whole world has to attain a special form.

Hence in your behaviour, in your speech, the beauty that is there should be visible. Especially in our Maharashtra, our language is also a bit strong. And we have now also learnt to talk with a lot of gestures. And until we do not speak curtly, we do not feel we are Maharashtrian. Means every person has to argue. And if there are no arguments for a while, then people feel something is still left, something is missing. A few, if not actual fights, some swear words have to be there, otherwise we do not feel we have been right. So this argumentative, quarrelsome attitude, rebellious nature – if nothing else then fight with the government. If not government then find something else, if nothing else then argue with a tree.

It’s become a habit. There is not fun without an argument. Otherwise met Mataji. So argue with Mataji. “Why didn’t You do this for us? We had specially come to You. Why did You do it for us?” As if I have taken charge of everyone. Maharashtrians are special in this. So it has to be seen what faults are there within us. Means, we are born with a quarrelsome nature – that should be accepted. Because we all are quarrelsome; from the start. So we must now see how much we argue with one another. Because the society that has this bad quality; this bad quality spreads out to such an extent that, speaking nicely to someone is considered as being a ‘yes’ man. I have now experienced this outside [Maharashtra].

From that I can tell you that man should have a kind of sweetness, a kind of beauty within. This especially, if it can come to Maharashtra; that in respect we have a lot of qualities. Twenty-six qualities if we see, we start to count. There are twenty-six qualities within a Maharashtrian man. But because these two, three are lacking all of these get covered. The way the sun gets covered because of the clouds. We get overshadowed because of these two, three qualities. Main is man is extremely principled; second is being “karmath” [conditioned]. Conditioned meaning, ‘Stand in the water now. Mataji has told this.” They will stand for twenty-four hours. Maharashtrian people. I have no doubt about it. Secondly, [they] are not greedy, will not take money from others; are honest. Thirdly they are not “jadavaadi” [materialistic]. They do not understand it much. Materialism. Like, in the North [India], lots of people are into materialism; not here.

There are numerous qualities. But in all the qualities only one defect is there and that is quarrelsomeness. And that quarrelsomeness has to absolutely go. There should be a “mardavta” [delicacy/tenderness] when talking to one another. Now let us take the example of Shivaji Maharaj. He fought with swords; won everything. But his manner of speaking, so far, has not been recorded. But he was so tender [in speech], that people held him in high regard. People respected his tenderness. Whether speaking to his mother, speaking to anyone else, never used an egoistic word. And because of that tenderness, he became world renowned. So those who have been there before us, we should learn their tenderness.

Now speaking of sadhu-sants [saints], it is said that sadhu-sants have a concession, a freedom. That even if you hurl two-four abusive words at someone, you are still a sadhu-sant. You use shoes [to beat], you are still a sadhu-sant. If you throw stones, you are still a sadhu-sant. You push someone [from a height], you are still a sadhu-sant. They have a free hand. It’s alright if we do it; we are saints after all. And there is no objection if you do it. Even if you hit with a whip in hand, you are Christ after all, so no objection. But Sahaja Yoga a different thing has come; that should be understood. There are many miracles in Sahaja Yoga; out of them this is another. That this will not be allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

Here even if you are saint, agreed – you have become great saints, have grown. But the method of doing the service is different. As each one has to spread Sahaja Yoga, this work has to be done with understanding, assimilation and a loving way. And if you are not able to do this work in a loving manner, then it will not grow. It will reduce. Those who are excellent will come in. But those who are not, they have to be drawn in with hard work. And this effort should be extremely sweet and nice. So, on this first day, we have to say that we have decided to take a “vrat” [fast]. In olden days, a resolution meant, “No food today” and then go on hitting everyone with shoes the whole day. “Today is the day of Hanuman, so fast in name of Hanuman.” Done; Hanuman has entered the house. Then don't ask, people ask if today is Tuesday, then we won't come to your house. “Why?” “Hanuman comes to your place on that day”. That means whoever observes the fast becomes Hanuman, then God knows whose head he will sit on [trouble them]. So, such a vrat is not acceptable to us.

The vrat is one, we want to increase in such a way, it should be done in such a way that we should become a pure vratee. People should know that this person has some special gift, that he is very refined in speaking and behaving with anyone. I have said this many times but today I will say it especially that this vrat should be observed from the morning. “I have spoken nicely how many people since morning?” Whatever someone else may be like, I say, that even if they are not Sahaja Yogis, what is the harm in speaking nicely? It is not necessary to get upset. And for that, now I will have to be upset. And it will be for the good, because till now I was not upset, so even if anyone like some baba from Rajapur [a false person]- because there were things that had to be restrained somehow – “you stay in it, you stay in Sahaja Yoga somehow.” Now you have to do this, only then people will remain; your overall behavior, your overall approach will be seen.

Then no one should think that we cannot keep someone in Sahaja Yoga by insulting or hurting them. First of all, we should pay attention to ourselves, if we look at it like that, you yourself are the Spirit, and you have seen your Spirit. And the people who have seen your Spirit should be happy, because the Spirit is the source of happiness, others should also feel happy in your company. And in that blissful state, where is the time to say any bad words. On the contrary, there are so words flow that everyone feels happy. Then this joy, this joy-giving power is Radha’s. For Radha is the joy-giving power of Krishna's. That power should be visible from your speech, because from the Vishuddhi Chakra, from speech, from your behavior and from your overall demeanour. Everyone should feel the joy. What people these are. What people, one feels the joy by just looking at them.

Now everyone's attention is on Mataji, and everyone loves Mataji, but if the dedication felt towards Myself starts to be felt towards others even a little bit, then Sahaja Yoga will blossom. Just struggle a little. You have to make a little effort, and you have to set a goal. “Today, I am going to take a vow of silence and see who I can help.” How does it happen? How does happen? How do you do it for Mataji? As soon as Mataji comes and sits, the attention comes to Mataji. What does Mataji need – the attention is there. Where does Mother sit? What does She need? I bring it to her. Like that. You have to remain in silence, then what is the need of others? Do you need this? Take it. Do you need that? Take it. When you behave in this way, you will be surprised that a new type of organization is going to be created, and in that organization, everyone will flourish.

Now only the blossoming is left. A lot has happened in Sahaja Yoga. I think you have gained a lot. Now the time has come to give, and it is time to give, that beauty, that comfort, that joy, that is to be enjoyed. And for that, you just need to open your heart, if you open your heart, that's it, you need a heart. If there is no heart, nothing will be achieved, everything will seem superficial. It should be done from the heart; if you want to do something for someone, the heart do it. So! I remember everyone, whose is hot-tempered, who gets angry a lot, some get angry silently, some get irritated.

I know everything, and I am noticing how people are changing. But if we want to do something new now, we think of something special. And after thinking that special way, you people go into meditation and decide that we should call four people, talk to them with love, sweetness, diplomacy, and explain to them that Sahaja Yoga is a very big blessing of God. Everyone should take it, we have been blessed, you should be blessed as we have been blessed. It is all in your hands, you are so strong, you have no idea how much you have received.

I met a guru who is realised. But he does not know any Shri Vidya, does not know pure vidya, does not know anything, does not know Kundalini awakening. [I] said what is this to a person, even though he is realised. What is the use, you are a pure man, [but] what is the use, you have understood everything and do not know the wealth of it. But you know everything, and it is very big, you have received so great, it is so great. Suppose you get a diamond; you do not set it in a stone, in the soil, you set it in gold. That is how your life should be like gold. Beautiful, elegant, to set this diamond in it, of your Spirit, that is how beautiful it is.

Everyone has so much attraction for Me, and I have for you. Everything is fine among you, but how should we pay attention to others, how should we treat others, we should pay attention to that. Everyone should take responsibility. It is small responsibility, yet; very great. The most important thing is that it depends on your nature. It depends on your behavior, and you should do it, I am ready to do whatever it takes for that, you know that My tapasvita is still going on. If you see how many journeys I take, you will be surprised that you run a little in a relay race, but I am in a marathon. That is, My entire race is going on, and it has been almost six months now and the journey is still going on. So you should take a little trip within yourself, and see what questions there are, and improve your path.

So from today onwards, should take a vow, which means that we will meditate, cleanse ourselves and clean our own lamp. Sahaja Yoga is not much; Sahaja Yoga is a simple thing I have discovered. That is, first light the lamp, first light the lamp and then you should clean the lamp. Without lighting the lamp, you cannot see the dirt in the lamp, clean it from the top and, work hard, and do penance, and chant and what is not good, light the lamp when you see it, take it if you like. Does he drink alcohol? No problem, light the lamp. Is he a bad person? Light the lamp, this is a debauched person, light the lamp. Then he sees in that lamp how debauched I am, then he will be clean like this.

You don't need to tell him anything, nothing. I have discovered this simple path of Sahaja Yoga, and with that, whatever you see now in this, look at yourself and clean it. That how do I do this, I am a soul, does this suit me? And how will my light go on? This lamp is full of dirt inside me, it needs to be cleaned. So this is your job, I have done what I have to do. I have explained everything, including how to clean this lamp.

I have explained everything to the Maharashtrians in Marathi, now I will talk to you a little in Hindi, because there are some people who do not understand Marathi language. But learn Marathi language here in Maharashtra, otherwise you will be left nowhere, because everyone learns the language of Hindi speaking people, that is why Hindi speaking people do not learn Marathi. See, Marathi is a very high language, and especially whatever has been written about Kundalini in Maharashtra, it is not there in any other language. Not in any language, it is surprising, because there are so many saints and sages here.

That way, Nanak Saheb has also written like this, and Kabirdas Ji has also written, but whatever they have written in their life, these people have written. But here every sage and saint has read Kundalini, many people have written, and many kinds of things have been written. Starting from Ramdas Swami onwards, and even before him there have been so many avdhoots here like Machindernath etc., such accomplished people, all of them have written a lot, and because of this there is a lot of knowledge of this in Marathi language, that is why you people should try to learn Marathi. I have also learned Hindi, and you people should also learn Marathi. Try to learn Marathi.

These people have also learnt a lot from you people. Like in the conversation of Hindi speaking people, it may be because of the Muslims that their way of talking is very beautiful. Although abuses are in Hindi language, there are no abuses in Marathi. You will be surprised that Marathi people use Hindi abuses. If they have to loosen their tongues whenever they have to abuse, they use Hindi abuses. I think they must have a few abuses in Marathi; one is that they say something like foolish and stupid. But if they want to give special abuses, then they have to learn them from there, specially they learn abuses from “bhaiyya” [colloquial term for people from the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar etc. in India] people. But they are very clever in fighting and quarrelling. It means that the arrangement for a fight is done quickly, and the people on the other side, they think that they will fight. Then they keep thinking that if they fight then they will have to invite trouble. So why fight, leave it, we will see the next day.

In this way, there should be an exchange among each other. The exchange should be such that the people who have come to Sahaja Yoga have gained a lot, gained a lot. I Myself am surprised. When I started with one person, in such a short time, gained a lot, and after gaining that, [they] made a lot of progress as well. Because the method was designed in such a way that first a lamp was lit within everyone. First the lamp was lit, then they themselves will see what are their shortcomings. There is no need to tell them, they themselves will see where the soot is applied in their room, otherwise they cannot see anything in the dark. I have developed this small method, that is why you all have crossed over. Without crossing over, you cannot understand, I have told you all this, that is why I helped you cross over. After making you cross over, I also taught you all the Shuddha Vidya. Now, a new aspect has emerged, one should say, that one has to reach a new destination, one has to decide on destinations, and this destination among them requires tapasya.

People of Maharashtra are great in tapasya, no doubt about it. They fall when they get into fights, meaning that two Maharashtrians cannot sit and do tapasya, it is good if one sits. If two sit, one of them will survive, the other will be gone. No brotherhood. And the rest of the people, there will be more brotherhood, they will sit together. But they will get involved in abuses, they will get involved in conversations, superficial things. So both should think that the superficial thing is also important, that how to talk to others, how to maintain relations with others, how is the exchange. Now if you go to any Maharashtrian's place, you will get just tea. If you get tea then it is very good, you will get sugar and water. But getting more than this becomes a little difficult. But if you go to any other place, even to a washerman's house, they will also give you food and drink by taking out whatever he has in his house, saying, “Brother take whatever you want.” And he will talk nicely, will have a nice conversation.

So, that very thing is very important for Sahaja yogis, because now we are coming to a new destination. Now in that new destination, till we do not cleanse ourselves with tapasya, till we do not rectify ourselves with hard work, until then other people are not going to accept you. That when you do something to others, then you should also see what you are doing to yourself. Like you are torturing your mother and sister, you are not looking after your children and you are flattering the whole world, then even that is not going to have any effect on people. And if you are looking at yourself, your family members, and you are looking at others as well, then the world will say, yes, this man is of some standard, there is something special about him, there is some miracle in this man. How is this life like this, how is it so wonderful. A man of the highest order. People should say that he is a man of the highest order. No matter how he was earlier, now it is difficult to understand what has happened to him.

In such a way when such things happen, by witnessing this, people will come to Sahaja Yoga and grow. Otherwise we will remain where we are. We have increased by four, then four decreased, eight increased, ten left. The stories that you must be hearing that, a man came for work, did half of it and ran away, then he came again, did this much and ran away, the same will keep happening in Sahaja Yoga. That is why people who run away cannot work here. One will have to sit, meditate and settle down, then they will go deeper. And how great is this wealth, how great is this power. This power should be increased. And how great is its joy; the joy which cannot be found in all the powers of the world. The joy which cannot be found with all the wealth of the world, is obtained with the wealth and power of the Spirit. With It’s abundance.

And when it is so deep within us, then why are we running after these things in vain? We hear from someone that that Sahaja Yogi runs after women. Has anyone got happiness by running after women? Forget about happiness, they don't even get respect. Have you seen anywhere till today that a statue of someone has been made because this man used to run after women, or someone has garlanded him because he used to run after women. It is not the work of Sahaja Yogis to get stuck in such low, petty things. It is a very lofty thing, he will have to rise to that height, if he does not rise then Sahaja Yoga cannot rise. What is going to happen because of Me? People will say that if You are [that] then You are. You are one. There have been many like You, and they have been there, but what have you created? If you have created something lofty, then we will also change after seeing it.

And that is why I repeatedly tell you to bring yourself to that height. Don't dwell on petty, lowly things - money, shells, all these things are useless - you won't get anything from them, you don't get any happiness from them. The country I am coming from just now, Riyadh, has so much money, so much gold. That if you go to the market, just like they sell necklaces here, necklaces - there are all gold [necklaces] on display all over the place. And they are so afraid that they don't even steal them, everything is hanging on display. Just as we have here garlands and decorations – miles upon miles - and no one steals them. They are so prosperous, but if you look at their faces, it seems as if someone has died in their house. All the gold, all the shine is in gold only, there is no shine at all on their faces. This is their condition, even after having so much Lakshmi, it seems that Saraswati is not there at all, intelligence is also completely absent, people are foolish, like donkeys. And the second thing is that there is no elegance, no beauty, no glow on the face, it flourishes in a strange state of nervousness.

That is why the peace that should be found inside a Sahaja Yogi, that love, peace and love, should be established, should flow inside, its glory should increase. Peace and love, inner peace and outside, the same peace and love. There should be peace in your tongue and love in your behavior. And if there is any kind of lust in love, then it cannot be love at all, it is a dirty thing. The love that is with any desire, any greed, is the only pure love, and that is the real thing, the rest is all imitation and useless. Just like we don't eat something rotten, similarly we should not get after these rotten and spoilt things because we are Sahaja Yogis. And you all are engaged in such a great task of Sahaja Yoga.

May God bless you all, and you should engage in this penance, and you should flow in this tapasya. You have My complete blessings. I Myself am engaged in this tapasya, that this is something you should see. You should try it, it is such a blissful thing that you are fascinated by your own virtues and qualities, you are enjoying your own qualities. You are enjoying, when you are giving something to someone you are enjoying, when you are having a nice conversation with someone you are enjoying, you are enjoying the conversation, it is such a wonderful thing. You should get it, and you should get into it. This thing should start from today, there should be a kind of exchange of love between all people, among themselves as well as with others. May God keep you all happy.

Today mainly all the yogis who have come from out of town and if they have any questions should meet Me is My desire. Today I don’t have time to give realisation as I see most of them are realised and since all these realised people setting here why should I give realisation. Everyone has become realised. Now you should work individually on how to attain your next steps in your individual spiritual ascent. That cannot be a general attention. You should start it; you should start from tomorrow. First of all, the tongue should be given a little twist. But the tongue turns as the mind turns, so should the mind. Now, if there are any people here who have something to tell Me, they should come up here.

I want to talk to the organizers who have come from outside. Extremely miraculous things have happened outside and have happened here too. So you see, Sahaja Yoga has been experienced, it does not need evidence. Just step into it now and let people see your growth in its light. If anyone has any questions, ask them, and if there is a group like that, come and meet Me later. Because now we have very little time for this thing overall. Today, I have come to you today for all this and I will be leaving on the 12th. So, on which date do we have our program here? [Inaudible reply by Sahaja Yogi] There is a puja at Chowk on the 11th. Let's all go there and meet there? After that? [Inaudible reply by Sahaja Yogi]. There is a program is from January 10th. But when will there be a seminar for everyone?

Sahaja Yogi: February.

Shri Mataji: Our seminar will be held on February 10th at Bordi. So, those who want to come or anything, should give the message here. And then those who want to work and help him should also give the message here. What is happening is that those who are working are doing so since 12 years.

Sahaja Yoga: Seminar from 10 to 16th.  

Shri Mataji: Those who have been working for ten, twelve years, I am seeing only them. Everyone should come forward that, “Mother, give us some work also. We will help you too. Let us also help.”  This is God's work, God's work. In this work everyone should be aware, What is the need? Who needs what? How can we help? It should not happen that only one person is working. It is wrong. You should give your cooperation. Now our program is not too much, now you see, for Bombaywala’s it is very little pressure. The only program which is from 11th? 

Sahaja Yogi: 10 to 16 January.

Shri Mataji: 10th January to 16th January [34:00] means only 7 days. What next? [inaudible reply by Sahaja Yogi]

Well, the tour of Maharashtra will start on the 17th. Now about the Maharashtra tour, all the groups are going up like this, I don't want to do it like this. At this time, those who want to go should inform Me. We want one or two persons to go on the tour with these people and those who want to go directly should reach the place directly and make their own arrangements. But this should not be done in this arrangement or with the money of these people. It happened last time, it happened before, it happened before, it should not be done like this.

Everyone should have their own self-respect, everyone comes for free and leave for free. It is not like that, on the contrary, one should contribute. This thing is very common in Sahaja Yoga and when new people come, I have specially observed that they just board on this [bus or train]. Now, if there was a bus of 50 people, seven more people get on board. And if questioned, “Why you?” “No, we came to serve Mataji.” What kind of service? Why do we need service on the bus? You come in your own bus if you want to serve. “No, we are coming along to serve you. The service is that they [bus inspectors] stop the bus on the road and make them disembark - why so many people are coming? Then give them money to eat; My service is going on for them.

So this time, please do not do any service for Me. The service you can do is spend some money and arrive there on your own. You should not be freeloaders. Freeloading does not suit Sahaja Yoga. On the contrary, if it costs a little, “Mataji we are there, don't worry.” I don't want your money, but still. And what is after that, after the tour, we will return to the Bordi here, on what date, Modi?

Modi: February 10 to February 16 [inaudible].

Shri Mataji: February 10 to 16. But still are you going to keep the foreigners for two days?

Modi: 14, 15 January [inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Foreigners are coming here on January 14, 15 and 16. Then we take a vow that we will not sit with them to eat. This need not be told; I am telling you because I am Mother. I saw that there are more people than them [foreigners] sit down to eat. Otherwise, who will pay for this? Mother has to pay from her pocket, now I don't have any facility to pay from My pocket; I have already given a lot. So please, don’t eat with them. Do not eat without paying. It need not be said, but it happens – what can I do? And these people have to suffer. Then everything should be done in a proper manner, how should one behave in a proper manner, royal, everything royal. What is your Mother’s behaviour? After asking ten times one says alright. I am sixty years old, have done this for sixty years, now no more going forward. A khadi saree, that's how a person should be royal. It is alright when giving but there should a royal dignity in taking.

That is why such scams should not be done at this time, if someone does it, then they should be exposed. You want to grow in Sahaja Yoga isn’t it? With this what will you get? By getting one [free] meal, what is the benefit? I don't want to get involved in such small things. Big people should be seen everywhere. Everyone should be respected, Sahaja Yogis who come – taking them somewhere, showing around [the city] - this should be done. But there should be no freeloading. When is this – 11, 14,15, 16? [Inaudible reply by Sahaja Yogi].

14, 15,16 these [people] are all coming back, you should show them hospitality. It should not be that you become guests, all that load is put on Me. You should be very good hosts to them; it will be a great enjoyment. Saints and sadhus are coming from foreign countries to our country, what is the objection to doing something for them. We are all giving, very hospitable people, we enjoy giving, so it should be done. It is a thing of enjoyment. When the saints come to your home, that is your Diwali, make something. The ladies should make something and bring it. They will also enjoy it. Instead, all of you come with friends and family here by a special bus saying that we are at Mother’s home and we will eat here.

I have seen there are two types of people which becomes a big problem. I have seen people who they will bring basket of fruits. “Mother, we got this basket for you, but since You won’t eat them please distribute these fruits to all the foreigners. They have come here, why should You have to spend; we will do it. It doesn’t take much [effort and money] but how beautiful it looks they made these things for them.

Now you ladies make karanjis [Maharashtrian sweet] and other things, get them. It will be so enjoyable. Bring karanjis for saints. What? Decide now what you want to cook. Each one bring one item each day. They are just hundred people. Even if you give one karanji each -like you do that for Diwali morning sweets. When you all are here why should you get anything from market?

They are exactly opposite of this, when you go to their country, everyday there is some program out. There someone gets something, someone brings a cake, someone something. So you should have it in your mind; when your mind is in it, you ladies know everything. You should bring some new food items for them. They will not lose anything. They have paid money for food, that is not a problem, they will not die hungry. But how are you going to show your love?

So the ladies should take this responsibility, to make some sweet dishes. It should not be that only two ladies are working daily, everyone should say I will cook this today, Mataji - that’s all. Even if four or five plan to cook; you can split your work – someone makes sweets. They are going to stay only three days in Mumbai. We should show them good hospitality for three days. You can decide on programmes for three days. You can make it exciting like Diwali, “jiwachi Diwali” [Marathi idiom means time of your life]. Then it will not feel like a burden. How to arrange and all, now let the women arrange this they will do it better than you.

You should do it with an open heart, it doesn’t need money, just in the mind. They are going to stay for 3 days until 14th then where are they going to go? To Vaitarna. Now those want to come to Vaitarna, can come but make your own arrangements. You should not put your burden of food arrangements on them. Next? What after Vaitarna? Nashik. Those who want to come to Nashik are welcome, but you have to make your own arrangements; everyone. Even in all this work, we can arrange the trip within a month, but you have to make your own arrangements. Ten of you can arrange your own conveyance – hire a bus, a tempo or anything else and you can start with that. You can do it. No objections. “We want to accompany Mataji for a month, we are going”. You are going with Shri Mataji you must plan for your food, accommodation and transportation. Don’t put that burden on Me, if you can do this much how nice it will look. 

Last time this was done in Kolhapur. And the arrangements were excellent. I had no trouble at all. What after Nashik?, Dhule, yes then we are going to Dhule. Like this you know the complete tour and plan where you can be and cannot be. Modi will give you the details of arrangements at all locations. You should write a letter to them know that you are coming but let them know that they should not arrange for your accommodation, or else they will end up getting busy for making your arrangements. You can go with a group or your family or if not even individually. But plan for the complete month; it is fun. And we will meet and do it again the following month. Those who can manage in this month should come this month who can manage next month can do that next month. Overall the experience is fantastic, so all these foreigners spend so much money and come for tour. You are staying here locally but don’t take benefit of it is not a good. So whoever can get leave should come but they should make their own arrangements.

That is all.  It is not difficult for the Maharashtrian people as you have your relatives all over, if you don’t you can plan for your accommodation somehow. If you have relatives it is good as you can get more people to Sahaja Yoga. When you are staying with your relatives, you tell them you are here for Shri Mataji’s program and get them here it becomes a reason.  Now next? What is to be done now? Just go?

Sahaja Yogi: I will give them a copy of the program.

Shri Mataji: The program is chalked out; we cannot change this. No one should say that this don’t suit us, so on and so forth. Make it suit you. If you have the desire, everything will work out. “We cannot do this, Shri Mataji this time we cannot do this, we cannot change this hall” – do not do all this. Everyone has organized with full joy and heart into this. You should not say you cannot do this. I tried to do everything you wanted me one day [inaudible] – I am ready. You should also show flexibility. If this starts everywhere then it becomes a big problem. What other point?

Sahaja Yogi: Programs are chalked out; we will give them the copy.

Shri Mataji: Now the programs are chalked out, take the copies of this. And pay attention. “Today Mataji is here” - so you should keep your attention on that place and meditate. Sit. Everyone should take the program copies. Now we are going to get lot of land and properties, everything has been obtained. But collectivity is less within us, so we cannot get the work done. We got a very big palace in Geneva; a big palace. It has everything; it is completely furnished. We get everything outside but not here, pay attention - it is because we are not collective. Only a handful of people always work, rest are only complaining about their health – “my heart attack, it is paining here” and all health problems but when it comes to help it is zero. When it is about contribution they say we have given once and not more, that is not the way.

Everyone should have your complete attention on Sahaja Yoga how you can help. No one is going to ask you for your money, but you should have the mind. You should have mana [desire] without desire it won’t work out. Now who want to volunteer give your names to Modiji. All those who are going to be there for 3 days or more with the tour give your names, give your time and offer to help wherever required. It is nothing great - just to get something from market, do something everyone should get ready. India is our home when we have guests visiting that too they are so close, affectionate, our relatives from all over the world are coming. You should have that attitude and thinking towards them. All others come for some personal reasons, but these Sahaja Yogis are coming for the work of Paramatma, and they are the people of Paramatma. How great this thing is, think it from this viewpoint and you will be overjoyed.

Now you should not fight for petty things. Like “you gave to my brother but did not give it to my wife”, I don’t want these types of things, for ladies. It is like we have things in marriages you have arguments and then keep sulking; I do not want to see these things. It is disgraceful. But it is common. Now what next; anything to discuss? Now all the organizers from each place should some and meet Me. Call from each centre. Any one from Nashik, from Dhule.

Sahaja Yogi: Dhumal.

Shri Mataji: From Rahuri.

Sahaja Yogi: Gaikwad.

Shri Mataji: From Pune.

Sahaja Yogi: Mr Mehtani. [inaudible/some snacks].

Shri Mataji: All this. For Me?

Sahaja Yogi: For Saheb [Sir].

Shri Mataji: What about him. He [inaudible/is not here]. Come, all of you. Hello, when did you come, Warren?  Very good, so nice to see you. May God Bless you. Now these people are going to leave, we will talk to all of these and ask Me if you have any questions. Distribute to everyone. Alright?
