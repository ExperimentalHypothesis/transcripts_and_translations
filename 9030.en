Talk to new Sahaja Yogis

Shri Mataji: Yes, they can be. Because you see, you don’t understand them so they play pranks and tricks on you, you see. So best thing is, to get realized, bring them to the ashram here and then they will start, you see, because they cannot manifest their realization, so then they get naughty with the parents, you see. They really get naughty with the parents, they don’t know what to do with them. Like my own granddaughter, oldest one, she told Me one day very seriously that: ‘You are after all the Goddess I know,, grandmother, but one thing is there: Can you do some mistakes in life?’ I said: ‘Why?’ This one thing I don’t understand, why don’t You give realization to my mother when she was born. Now, she is very difficult for me (everybody laughs). I said: ‚Really?’. ‚Yes’ she said, ‘now she is become hard. It’s difficult, but in childhood You should give her realization.’ But I said you must ask? ‚Not for children. It is all right for elder people that they should ask, but as children, You could have given her realization, it would have been much better for me. Now, she is very hard.’ So, on their side they cannot understand.
