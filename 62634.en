Interviewer: What is the Kundalini?

Shri Mataji: The kundalini is the power of pure desire in the triangular bone. All our desires are impure, because when the desires are fulfilled, we are not satisfied. Only desire which is pure is this one. When it ascends, then we know that the desire was to be one, to be united with the Divine Power which is All-pervading.

Interviewer: [Question in Italian]

Shri Mataji: One must understand that you cannot pay for Divine work because it is a living work. Like the seed, when it sprouts, you don't pay any money to the Mother Earth. You see, it is a living work of the Divine. You can't pay for it. The first thing is you should not pay for anything. Anybody who takes money in the name of Divine or lives on that in the name of Divine is sinful.

Interviewer: Why you don't have practical exercises, physical and all these things?

Shri Mataji: No, no practical exercise is needed. It's a living process, again. It's a living process of the living energy. And for living process you don't do any exercise. It has to work spontaneously. Sahaja means spontaneous.

Interviewer: If there are no exercises and there is nothing to do. How is the Kundalini awakened? And if people don't meet you. How can they get the Kundalini awakened?

Shri Mataji: They meet Me somehow, now for on the television now there will be so many. Those who are seeking the Divine meet Me. They will meet Me somehow. And if they don't meet Me, they'll meet Guido. Tomorrow you get enlightened, they'll meet you. Like one light can enlighten another light and it can enlighten another light.

Interviewer: You had the lucky to meet Ghandi in your life. Did you take something from him? Did you take this practice of Kundalini awaking from him?

Shri Mataji: No, not from him. Actually, he was busy with the independence movement. And if he had survived, then he would have taken to this, and he would have propagated about Sahaja Yoga. But that time he was busy with the problems, which were very different and immediate.

[Self-Realization]

Shri Mataji: A cool breeze in your hands.

Interviewer: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: You will be atmosphere is artificial. It's working out inside. And you will feel thoughtless. There's no thought. You will feel very relaxed. All kinds of diseases are also cured with this and you feel extremely relaxed and peaceful and blissful. But it is to be established. And you all have to master it so that you can give it to others too. Even the young people like this can master it and they can become real masters. They are better suited because they are not so complicated and they are innocent. Also ask them to put it on top of their head. A fontanel bone area. The cool breeze is coming out of your head. And his eyes are sparkling because his eyes are sparkling.

Interviewer:Thank you very much.

Shri Mataji: Thank you.
