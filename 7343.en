Mahashivaratri Puja (Hindi/English). Delhi (India), 9 February 1991.

[Hindi to English translation]

Today, we have gathered to perform the worship of Shri Shiv. It is said that Lord Shiva is very simple and innocent, which is why understanding Him is very difficult. The work of Kundalini is the work of Devi. It is Devi who creates this entire universe, and in the end, she manifests within us as Kundalini, leading us to the realization of Shiv Tatva.

While performing Shiv puja, we should remember whether the virtues and qualities of Shiva have developed within us. Therefore, it is important to first understand the movement of the Kundalini. When the awakening of Kundalini occurs, it first makes your body healthy. Because it is necessary for the body to be healthy , this is why our attention initially goes toward our body. In the beginning, people often share their ailments, struggles, or material worries. Some people are so attached to their bodies that they talk about their worldly troubles. When we are in the awakened state, our attention naturally gravitates toward these things, and this often causes us distress. As you progress in Sahaj Yoga, you will notice that people initially talk about their physical ailments, worldly concerns, or mental states.

In the past, it was thought that one should completely renounce the body, meaning one should not pay attention to the body or give it comfort. There were practices where, if someone was sleeping on a mattress, they would be advised to sleep on the floor, then on a hard surface, then on stone, and even in mud. These methods were used to toughen the body so that later it would not cause any discomfort. Comfort for the body was not accepted in any way. For example, if someone had a night of sleeplessness and felt discomfort, they were advised to stay awake for seven nights, and then 24 nights if necessary. Similarly, with food, if a person had a strong desire for food, they were instructed to fast for one day, then seven days, and even 40 days. Anything they disliked, they were told to eat, and to leave everything they liked, even to eat only roots and vegetables. If someone was fond of wearing fancy clothes, they were asked to wear simple clothes, then even lighter clothes, and eventually go to the Himalayas, strip off all clothes, and endure the cold. Likewise, if someone had desires for a comfortable home, they were told to live in a hut. If they felt insecure in a hut, they were encouraged to live in the jungle. They were also encouraged to visit holy places. For example, if someone was from Kanchi, they would go to Kashi, and if from Kashi, they would go to Kanchi. On the way, a lion would devour them, and if the lion spared them, a snake would bite them. If the snake spared them, a crocodile would take them. By the time they reached their destination, only one in a thousand would remain. In this way, people were made to endure extreme hardships, and only after that, the concept of self-realization was introduced.

However, in Sahaj Yoga, the approach is completely different. In Sahaj Yoga, you don’t have to renounce your home, family, food, or clothing. You don't need to leave anything behind. You can remain as you are, and through the practice, you will achieve spiritual growth and realization without having to endure unnecessary hardships. "And in such a state, your Kundalini will awaken. Kundalini will only awaken in such a state. "First, they used to spread a deer's skin and sit on it, then meditate, and their penance would begin. After that, they would remain hungry for many days, and their bones would start to show. Even then, they would be tested; they would be hanged upside down, thrown into a well two or three times, and their condition would be observed."

In Sahaja Yoga, the responsibility is reversed. First, we created the peak, opened the summit, the Sahastrar, and after opening the Sahastrar, we said that you should fix yourselves. But even then, we cannot understand that Sahaja Yoga is as difficult as it is simple, just like Lord Shiva. Because there are many channels within us, and the way to open those channels is to ensure that our mind does not get entangled here and there. In Sahaj Yoga, no one tells you to leave food and drink, to fast, or to go and sit in the Himalayas in the cold. No one tells you that. But what should be done for our progress? So, the first thing we should do is reflect on our inner mind and think, 'What am I doing?' For example, if you went somewhere and saw that you didn’t get a place to sleep, you would immediately start complaining, 'Look, we didn't get a place to sleep.' At that time, you should think, 'Why am I saying this?' Because I am worrying about my body, that I didn’t get a place to sleep, and I am getting my mind tangled in this. Now, at that time, you should think, 'It’s good that I didn’t get a place to sleep.' Now, just sleep as you would; look at your body and say, 'This is how you sleep; you have to sleep like this, you are a Sahaj Yogi. Why do you need a good place to sleep? How many people in the world sleep on the road? Who are you to need a good place to sleep? People even sleep standing up, why can’t you sleep standing?' And is it really necessary to sleep? What do you think of yourself? One should question their body like this. If someone doesn’t eat for one day, they would feel as if disaster has struck. I have seen it. People suffer greatly if they don’t get food for a day. But if you don’t get food for a day, you should think, 'This is good, now let me see what will happen to you, will you die?' One should start scolding their body like this, and from their own side, start scolding the body. Nowadays, people are obsessed with the body’s whims. Like if we wear clothes, they must match. This is the latest trend, meaning these modern things have emerged, and their standards are so artificial that we don’t even realize we are becoming slaves to this artificiality. This doesn’t mean you should become completely mad. It doesn’t mean you should wear clothes in a strange way and roam around. It doesn’t mean you should become a hippie. And understand this, if a woman doesn’t find a matching blouse, she feels like she is finished. In old times, no one even cared about matching. Now, if she doesn’t find a matching sweater, it’s the end. Who cares what you wear? Who notices you? What difference does it make if you wear or don’t wear something? And what significance does your attire have that by seeing you, someone’s Agyna chakra will open or some device will be activated? Nothing will happen. On the contrary, if someone sees you, they might get stuck. Sometimes I walk with my eyes lowered. People ask why do you walk with your eyes lowered? I say, "Brother, it's fine, let me walk, but sometimes it requires courage to say that this is an eye, it has to work, and it has a lot to do."

But in this Kali Yuga, the amount of assault is more than ever before. Similarly, if something begins, like in the West where your hair should be completely tangled, then everyone starts walking around with tangled hair like that. Hey brother, you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are special, why are you doing this? You should ask yourself, why am I doing this? Why do I care so much about the comfort of my body? Why do I want to make myself like others in the world, why do I want to live in the same way? I am special. But how can one be special? If you go somewhere, and pour water all around the room, saying, "We are special," or sit anywhere and eat without washing your hands, saying, "We are special." Being special means you need to stop the running and restlessness of your attention. You need to merge your attention into consciousness. Listen again, you need to merge your attention into consciousness. But if your attention is wandering here and there, how will it merge into consciousness?

So first, this body and the desires of the mind need to be controlled. The mind has fifty desires. In your heart, where Lord Shiva resides, there are four channels. One of these channels goes down to the Muladhara and beyond that is hell. So people say, "What's wrong with this? What's the harm?" But you are a Sahaja Yogi, why are you going towards hell, Baba? Your path is already set, so why are you going towards hell? So, you should pay attention to your attention and ask, why do I have this desire within me? Why is it there, and for what purpose is it leading me towards hell? I have one foot raised upwards, and the other foot is placed in the grave. So, either sit in the grave, or remain upwards. In this suspended state, you should tell your mind, "Where are you running? Do you want to go towards hell?"

Its other channel leads us towards desires. That’s why Buddha clearly said that any desire we have is the cause of our death. This is why we grow old and become ill because we have desires. That’s why we should be desireless. Our desires should be completely eliminated. But they don't get eliminated. Only a pure desire should exist. How should it be? A pure desire should be such that you think, "Why do I have this desire? Why am I running after this desire?" I have had many desires like this, but what did I gain from them? So, accepting whatever you have and finding joy in it is the duty of a Sahaja Yogi. Now, this happened that someone had the desire to sit right in front of Mother, or some had the desire to go first and stand there.

Why did this desire arise? Because in ignorance, we did not understand that Mother is everywhere, so what is the need to go anywhere? When you have a pure desire, and when the Kundalini rises, the desire channel, which is turned downward, shifts upward, and it fills with pure desire. The desire that a human has is driven by the thought that it will bring happiness and pleasure, but nothing really comes from it. So, this desire should be immersed in joy. The essence of Shiva is bliss, and his nature is bliss, so one should find bliss in everything. Then, nothing will seem flawed. We often see people who always find faults in everything. For instance, while walking down a road, someone might say, "Why didn't they plant flowers here?" Then, they might say, "Why is there no proper sign here to show the way?" or "Why isn't this path turned in a different direction?" Oh, Baba, you're not in the municipality, why do you care? Whatever is there, is there, why are you complaining? But when it comes to others, they will always say, "If this was done this way, it would have been better." But even the thoughts they have cannot be implemented. It doesn't concern you. Like when many people go to the cinema, and if a scene shows a man walking and about to fall from a hill, they will shout, "Oh no, you're going to fall!" But he is just in the movie; will he listen to you? Similarly, people take it upon themselves to manage others and create a complete chain of thoughts in their own minds. However, what you see should only be seen, and when it is just to observe, it becomes pure observation. Even in a single glance, inspection happens. And a picture forms inside you. But that is not true seeing; that is called ‘Niranjan seeing,’ meaning there should be no attachment, no reaction. Just look, and what’s the benefit of reaction? This is what I explained earlier—if someone is doing something in a movie, and you’re saying, ‘Oh, oh, don’t do that,’ is the person even listening to you? This is also the element of Shiva. You might reach the place of Shiva, and even have the vision of his idol, but until his light comes within us, everything is in vain.

Now, the third channel is where love rises. Love means your son, your daughter, your brother, your father, your husband—these are all relationships in the world. Even after coming to Sahaj Yoga, many people remain entangled in them for years. I still see how they don't let go of them. The same old talks, the same old things, again and again. ‘Oh, my brother’s situation, my sister’s situation, my son did this, my daughter did that.’ To say that these relationships are futile is not the right way to approach it. Attachment is such that for your children, you might even kill someone, end someone’s life, do anything for that attachment. For a wife, for a lover, or for a husband, a person wastes their life in this attachment. And then, when you see that the very people for whom you did so much are your enemies, they’re the ones tormenting you, they cause you the most pain. The pain increases because you did so much for them, and they did this to you in return. If you’ve done a Favor for someone and they caused you pain, the grief increases even more—‘I did so much for this person, and they did this to me.’

In the past, people used to say, ‘Renounce everything, leave home, leave your children, leave your wife, leave everything behind and go to the forest to live in solitude. In Sahaj Yoga, it’s not like that. In Sahaj Yoga, you do not have to renounce anyone. You have to accept everyone. Because Sahaj Yoga is not an individual act where you sit in solitude, perform penance, and become highly elevated—what is the benefit of that? If you become an ascetic, what’s the use? Yes, fine, a person like that may be able to give good speeches or might even shower some consciousness, but that cannot fix the whole world. We need to fix the entire world. So, think about why I only hold attachment to a few limited people. There’s a reason for this. There was a gentleman who said he liked someone a lot. I asked why. He said, ‘Because their hair is very beautiful.’ I asked, ‘Do you like their hair, or do you like them?’ Then some would say, ‘Their behaviour towards us is very nice.’ Someone might speak sweetly and they’ll seem nice. Someone may wear certain clothes and they appear good. Then, ‘Oh, they are from Delhi,’ and after that, ‘Well, these are from Old Delhi, even closer,’ and ‘They are from the vegetable market.’ The person we bought our bull from is the same person they bought from, even closer! I don’t know how far this goes—‘Their barber and our barber are the same.’ And they embrace each other saying, ‘Wow, wow, wow.’ Otherwise, ‘They’re from Delhi, Mumbai, this, that, etc.’ But now, you are a citizen of the world, so where is the distinction between Mumbai, Delhi, or Madras? If that is in your mind, then you have not understood Sahaj Yoga yet. When will this happen? It will happen when your attachment is merged in compassion. Compassion, which is the ocean of mercy, the ocean of Shiva. You should merge in compassion, then you will understand what should be understood, what should be done with whom, and how to remain untouched.

I have often given an example that if you pour water on a tree, the sap that rises reaches every branch, every leaf, every flower, and every fruit of the tree, and then returns. If it doesn’t return, it will get blown away, but if it gets stuck in just one flower, the tree and the flower will both die. This is what is called unconditional love. It is said in the descriptions of the goddess that her love is unconditional. If she does something for someone, she doesn’t even think about whether it was done or why it was done, whether it should have been done in another way or anything at all. It’s done, it’s gone, finished—forget it. It doesn’t stick in the mind. Day and night, the mind does not keep humming about it. It doesn’t get entangled in anything. Because she is merged in compassion, in the ocean of mercy. And when one is merged in the ocean of compassion, the moment someone comes with a problem, they will think, ‘Baba, fix their problem.’ Later, if they go and bring a knife or do something, that thought doesn't even arise. If there is a problem, just fix it. This person has an issue, fix it. Although I know that some issues have no meaning, still, I listen to them with great seriousness and ask, ‘What is the problem? Tell me, what’s going on? Yes, this is what’s happening, that is what’s happening.’ People meet from their own circles. I may not fit into their circle, and if they are not able to fit into my circle, it’s not their fault. They should fit into it. They should fit into such circles—that is what compassion is. Compassion is for compassion’s sake, not for any work, any reason, any relationship. There may be a great person, a small person, a beggar lying on the street, anyone. Compassion is such that, as you may have seen, if there is a sea, no matter where there is a hole, it will fill with water. No matter where there is a flaw, it will fill it. Similarly, the nature of compassion is such that when it sees someone in trouble, it just wipes their tears, removes their suffering. Not because it wants something in return or to take something—there is no ulterior motive. It is simply because that is the nature of compassion, the nature of water, the nature of the ocean. The word 'Swabhav' is so beautiful—'swa' means soul and 'bhav' means feeling. When the feeling of the soul arises within you—just compassion—then all distinctions like 'from Delhi,' 'from Mumbai,' 'this person,' 'that person' will break. They will no longer hold importance. You will remember who everyone truly is—their pain, their suffering—and as soon as you look at them, you will remember. Where has your gaze gone? If your gaze is searching for 'who is from Delhi,' 'who is from Mumbai,' 'who is from Calcutta,' if your gaze is searching for these things, then you haven’t yet understood where compassion is going. If your gaze is searching for where compassion is going, towards whom it is heading, who it is drawing you towards, then you will know. There will be a suffering person, a great seeker, and your heart will immediately feel drawn towards them. It is compassion that gives you both wisdom and memory —because the closeness you get from compassion is not possible from any relationship. Compassion is a special thing, and merging yourself into compassion is the path to progress in Sahaj Yoga. Because I have never said, ‘Leave your children, leave your home, sell everything and bring all your money to me.’ That’s what some so-called saints say nowadays.

But Sahaj Yoga is the opposite. No matter who you are, wherever you are, keep growing inside. It won’t happen without looking within. Then you must think, ‘Am I full of compassion?’ If someone asks you for something and you tell them, ‘Sorry, I can’t help this time,’ they get offended. This shows all attachment is about you—what will I get, what will I gain, what will be my benefit? But attachment is not outside. No matter what state someone is in, no matter how they are, compassion finds its way on its own, beautifully. It is very blissful. To experience compassion, to be immersed in it, and to work through it brings bliss, but there is no greed in this bliss—there’s no desire to experience it again and again. Its experience is simple—done, finished, like listening to music. You enjoy it, and once it’s over, it’s done. Similarly, if any task is done, it’s completed—immersed in it.

Now, the fourth channel in our body is extremely important in the heart. This fourth channel is awakened through the awakening of Kundalini, and it rises from the left Vishuddhi chakra, going up to the brain and making the lotus bloom. When our consciousness is immersed in all these things, it’s as if life or energy enters the lotus, or as if water falls on a plant and it grows on its own. In the same way, when a person’s consciousness becomes pure, the bud of their heart blooms and transforms into a lotus that expands into the Sahastrar. Then its fragrance, its scent, spreads all around and such a person becomes completely prostrated, completely bowing in front of everyone. If someone says that you have done a big thing for me, a great miracle, then that thing does not touch them. Just like waves of bliss go towards the shore and make noise, but they don’t return, in the same way, when a person reaches this state, all their work makes a sound outside, it makes a noise. Its effect is visible outside, on the shore. There is no result of this inside them, no thought even comes, no idea even comes. Now, sometimes when you all started singing the welcome song, I thought, are you doing it for someone else? I was looking here and there, for whom are you singing, whose welcome are you doing? I get scared sometimes that I might start singing along with you. Sometimes when you all chant my victory cries, I get very scared that I might also start saying "Jai Shri Mataji." Truly, it doesn’t touch. Whatever you say, whatever your sounds are, they go and touch the other shore, they don’t touch me, they don’t reach me. Yes, it might be that the deities inside might become happy and send forth the consciousness or do something, and it might reach that shore, but as far as I am concerned, I never feel any trace of it. That you are singing my victory, I might not even be there. This state may not be so nurturing for you all yet, but one thing is for sure, when you sing praise, the deities are happy, the deities inside you also become pleased and send forth an infinite amount of energy from infinite channels, such rays of light inside you. You must have seen this in photographs. They work so hard for you. So, it is also very necessary for you that when they are working so hard for us, we should also achieve this purity. So, the body we are cursing, the body we are not acknowledging, that same body becomes a Yagya. Yagya means now this body of ours, if suffering is happening, then it is necessary because this is a Yagya, a good thing. Just like the burning of wood is necessary in a Yagya, in the same way, the burning of this body is also necessary in a Yajna. But in Sahaj Yoga, the most important thing is that this Krit Yuga starts from your previous virtues, and you don’t face much difficulty specifically. Everything comes and stands in front, all realizations keep happening, you say miracles are happening. Everything becomes available to you easily. Many tasks become simple and easy for you. It is called a "beautiful, easy pace." In such a glorious life, you can easily achieve it. There is no need to do anything inauspicious or shameful. So, this is a subtle illusion too, that one shouldn’t think that all these miracles are happening for us because we are some great heavy Sahaj yogis. But it should be thought that these miracles are happening because our faith in the Divine, Shiva, and Kundalini has become firm. This is why the miracles are happening, and the task to strengthen this is to purify our mind. Because Shiva is the embodiment of consciousness (Chitta) and the power of that consciousness, which is considered a form of divine awareness, is called as as Chitti, He is Chit.  

Chit means consciousness which is all-pervading, you know, the consciousness, the mind of that consciousness is the grace of Shiva, it is the essence of Shiva. This means their consciousness is spread throughout the universe, and when you say that a miracle happened, it occurred, then you should understand that this consciousness, which we call "Chitti," is the one who did it. His attention is in every atom, every particle. But the meaning of attention is that it is the witness, it is observing. Attention means that it is the witness, it is observing, and the one who is executing is Brahman consciousness. But just like a musician, as you saw yesterday or when you see, they play looking at the audience, in the same way, Brahman consciousness executes the work after seeing the consciousness's sight. Brahman consciousness knows that sight, that "chitti," and it executes the task when it deems it appropriate after looking at that sight. Just like when we came, immediately, a gentleman came and as soon as he saw me, he said, "Water, Mataji is coming!" He immediately became flustered upon seeing me. He looked at me, I didn’t say anything, I did nothing, just by looking at me, he became flustered. In the same way, whether they say something or not, because Brahman consciousness is this divine power, and it is executing, and it knows the one observing. And the role of that power all the time is the same, to keep that one observer happy. So, sometimes you might say, "Mother, why did this mistake happen?" Yes, it happened because the direction of that Chitti  had changed. If you are worshiping Shiva today, then pay attention to the four channels I mentioned, and as I told you, how you should align your consciousness with these four things. This is not a deep thing but subtle, and then you let me know that by doing introspection, whatever dialogue or penance you did or conversations you had, and by purifying your consciousness, you will immediately find that you have fully immersed yourself in the ocean of Shiva. And I sincerely wish that this state happens for all of you.

[English transcription at 00:50:12]

Today's lecture was quite big for all of you who are here, I'm happy that you could all come down for the Shiva Puja and now as they have requested in Europe, also we are going to have a Shiva Puja on the 17th I think in Rome.
They have never had a Shiva Puja in the West. And that's why I have decided that we'll have two pujas, though it is quite a difficult thing to have Shiva's puja in such close proximity. Today I have told them how we have got four channels in our heart where Shiva resides, and how we have to introspect ourselves and control our attention, because in Sahaja Yoga there is all freedom to be the way you are, nothing must be sacrificed or to be given up as they were told before, to go to the Himalayas, take out all your clothes and shiver there in the cold and all sorts of things. The body, importance of the body has to be reduced. and for that you have to put your attention inward and try to find joy in everything.
To put your attention inside is very easy because you are meditative. Supposing you are going by bullock cart. If a man is used to Rolls Royce he will be all the time complaining what is this nonsense, why I have to go by a bullock cart, horrible, this that...But a child if he is in a bullock cart, he will be enjoying it,
what a nice thing, you are jumping up and down very nice, how the bullocks are arranged beautiful, you can watch everything so carefully outside. Because he is so innocent like Shiva. Like you want to have a proper bathroom, you want to have a proper bed, you want to have all these things.
But if you want to make fun out of it it's very interesting. Once I went to Lucknow, I went to stay with a relation of mine. And there only one cot, not so rich, they've lost all (inaudible), they said we have only one cot, if you want you can sleep on the cot or on the ground.
I said all right, I will try this cot business. That cot was made of (inaudible) and it was all touching the ground like that, so it was just like sleeping on the ground, but it was all like this. But in the night I found lots of rats running over my body, I was watching them so the people got very much worried, they said what's these rats are crawling upon you and going round and round, yes I said, one of them is still here under my foot. So they said aren't you disturbed? I said what it is to be disturbed? I'm just watching them, I've never seen so many rats together. Just enjoying them.
And then they said you are sleeping in this kind of a cot and you might get little pain tomorrow and I said no, no, no I'm just enjoying, this is like a nice swing here, you see nicely you can move about, it's very nice, very interesting. and the next day I was very fresh and they were surprised how am I so fresh.
So all these discomforts of body and all that, and the way we are correcting everything and grudging about everything, complaining about everything is just a myth. Now you don't have to go to that austerity, what you have to do...Surrender all these things into the ocean of joy, or dissolve it into the ocean of joy all these comforts. Then also the artificial norms of life that have come up - like you have to have disheveled hair, otherwise you are not in. You have to be really crazy to be in. There are many other things stupid I think very much that have come in vogue and people are following them, because they are the norms.
If you don't do that, then you think you are not all right or others may start thinking oh, what funny man he is. That doesn't mean you should be funny or you should be hippies or anything. But not to be so much worried about the norms. Like one day I saw one gentleman who was extremely upset, in England, Indian gentleman. I said what happened? Why are you so upset? He said you know by mistake I used the fish knife for eating meat. So what? Everybody watched me, you see. I said it's all right. You didn't thrust into anyone. It doesn't matter if you have eaten...fish knife...if you have used a fish knife for this.
So you must use fish knife first, then this, that, all nonsense. it's not so important. then, your equanimity, then your balance. so, all these little little things can also upset us. on the contrary, I would say oh - really? I did eat ha? with the fish, very good. it is a good thing that I broke something, a big image of formal dinner it was broken. so it was good, next time everybody will do that. it may start as a fashion, possibly. if you just put your attention in such a way, that body is not for the penance, but for the Havana. is to be used for the Havana. for the YAgnya, and then you can tell your body nicely that now - please behave yourself, or say. so first you have to denounce it. all it's demands. and then it becomes a thing that you use it for doing God's work. I must say compared to Indians, westerners are much better in this respect, I must say that. Indians wanted first the best rooms there is, to fight for it. now gradually they are coming round a little bit but still, sometimes they are starting grudging about this grudging about that. but that way I do not know how, but I must say that in the west or even in Australia people are not so much bothered about this deal. I remember once, we had gone to Ganapatipule long time back. and there were no arrangements for sleeping, because the empty (Inaudible), they said we will do it the next day. so many of them just went to the seashore and slept there the night. they said - Mother we enjoyed it, it was a full moon and we really enjoed among ourselves. the second part is the attachments are there, with people. we can say first of all, it's the desire. the desire to have this, desire to have this have that. all kinds of desires. as you have seen, they were never fulfilled, and we are never satisfied with them when they are satisfied. so, what do we do with our desires? dissolve it into "Shuddha-Iccha", into to the pure desire of kundalini. and third thing is that, we have our relations, I mean I have seen with the westerners especially when they get married, I do not know what happens to them. then suddenly they think they now married so now they have become Romeo and Juliett raised to power 108. and of course Indians are the other way round. I mean that both are just the same.
so, one has to understand that's alright - that is an event of marrying. but the attention should not be entangled with any person whatsoever. as I have told you many times the sap of the tree has to rise vertically, to give it's attention to all the parts of the tree and go back. if it is attached to any one of the parts the whole tree will die as well as that part will also die. so every relationship whatever you have to give whatever you have to do to your sister, to your brother, to your children, to your wife (Inaudible)... so what you will do about attachments? dissolve it in compassion. a compassion that (Inaudible)...the nature of the compassion is that fulfills all the (Inaudible), all the balance, all the defects, just (Inaudible).. a fourth one is the one which is for your ascent. then your attention is so pure that it manifests its fourth channel which blossoms (Inaudible) through your left Vishuddhi into your Sahasrara and becomes a Lotus, Lotus of fragrance. then the Sahasrara starts giving the fragrance of the heart (Inaudible) combination of the heart and (Inaudible). So this attention itself, is a power of shiva. this attention as we call it "chitti", and this attention is spreading (Inaudible) all-pervading power "Chaitanya". and this attention.....(Inaudible)....Chaitanya power go into action. finally, this attention is quiet. it just watches, it just sees. It doesn't react, but you see, this attention is just watching. and they know what it is and accordingly they act. so Shiva is just spectating, watching the work of the goddess. he is the only spectator, and if he sees that human beings are not respectful to this power then he (Inaudible) and destroys the whole world, destroys the whole work of the Goddess. so, it is important that you all should join hands to work it out - the work of the goddess. so that Shiva is happy, and we create a new world of spirituality and beauty. may God bless you.
