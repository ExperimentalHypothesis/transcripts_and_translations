1983-0925 Picnic in San Diego, USA 

Yogi: – quite a lot of newspapers [UNCLEAR] but not here in Los Angeles…

Shri Mataji: But nobody can come in and interview? 

Yogi: There are three main newspapers they were approaching: the Times, the Daily News, the Harold Examiner and none of them wish to make an interview.

Shri Mataji: What about this gentleman [UNCLEAR] what was he saying? How will he be making contact with you? What was his idea?

Yogi: His idea was we should mount a reception and he would invite various notable people and members of the press. But then he found that the notable people he wanted to invite were either not available or the mayor said that he didn’t attend such functions. At that time my wife said that she didn’t know what to do at that point. 

Shri Mataji: But when will he be available? We should find out. Also they could arrange an interview with anyone of these people also. Yogi Mahajan has arranged something, I think, in San Francisco. San Francisco, there is some article coming in?

Yogi: Yes, he has arranged for some fellow with the unlikely name of Randy Schultz who is attending the first program and will be reporting on that. I’m not quite sure whether they intended, or have asked for, an interview or not. I will know that tomorrow. Certainly he is attending the first program. That’s the main San Francisco newspaper. 

Shri Mataji: That’s a different thing altogether isn’t it? The kind of thing we have had really in Australia is the best type. So nobody would be interested in interviewing or something?

Yogi: Not in Los Angeles. 

Shri Mataji: They are also just reporting but no interview as such?

Yogi: Mother, there is some story with a woman from the Daily News that [UNCLEAR] was talking about interviewing You. She [UNCLEAR] something about Muktananda and there’s trying to be some negotiations that You would speak against Muktananda or something. All I know is that the people from the Daily News said that she’d run a number of people in the Indian community to see if  they had ever heard of You and they hadn’t.

Shri Mataji: The ambassador knows Me. 

Yogi: We did get the names of the people who did know You but she still wasn’t interested. So my next  attempt was to try and get at the truth of the Rajneesh Rancho. There was a series of articles about Rajneesh.

Shri Mataji: Against him?

Yogi: No, it seemed more for him, really. So we thought that if we could say that when You have a lot against Rajneesh that we could get some headway, but that would be negative from our point of view. That’s what happened in Los Angeles.

In another area of Los Angeles I met and spoke to one fellow when I was across here last year, a fellow called John Dart on the LA News. I gave him a lot of information and since then I’ve been sending him information with a view for preparing him for this tour of Yours. But when it came down to it he said that no, he wasn’t interested in doing an interview. That was after about six months of …

Shri Mataji: They are more political-minded people but there must be somewhere in between, something that gives – like Yoga Today or someone.

Yogi: That’s what I asked   What is the thing that is interesting? Do You know people that could write some editorial in Los Angeles Times? I told him there was an editorial return on false gurus from India and there was an editorial return on this man from Bombay [Rajpal] who controls the industry. So I said that why not write the editorial. You know somebody that could write any column?

They only seem interested in sensational news. We could approach them and say there is a controversy at the church.

Shri Mataji: It cures cancer which is the most sensational thing one could think of.

Yogi: We could try that. We have played that aspect of curing down until now but we could try it.

Shri Mataji: Wherever it is needed it must be. But now there is no question.

Yogi: I think the press agents have been talking to the press in that area because one of the things that interested them most was the fact that there was a cure for AIDS.

Shri Mataji: But still they are not interested?

Yogi: It seems that the interest here lies in Los Angeles, in television. It is of course a television town, it’s the television capital of America anyway and probably the world.

Shri Mataji: And nobody reads the newspapers?

Yogi: I think there are people all over the world that probably know what Los Angeles looks like better than cities in their own country, just because so many shows are filmed in Los Angeles.

This is the place more for the show on the television. The East coast of America are more oriented towards newspapers. I think newspapers are taken more seriously on the East coast than here on the West.

Shri Mataji: Something like Readers Digest or something because Sue Arnold from – what is that bakery in London? [UNCLEAR that BNC] interview. You could use that. Have you got that article with you?

Yogi: Yes I have.

Shri Mataji: Readers Digest is something substantial and I have great faith in them.

Yogi: Mother, there are weekly newspapers that they sell in the grocery stores that just deal with things that are sensational and if we went and said something of the sort like, “UN diplomat’s wife claims to be Holy Ghost,” I’m sure they would publish it and it would reach millions of people. I don’t know whether that would be acceptable.

Shri Mataji: That’s a bit too much but we could say that people say, “She’s the one prophesied by Christ as the Holy Ghost, many believe.” But don’t give UN. Diplomat’s wife you can use.

Yogi: Mother, they turn any kind of a story into that kind of story and they reach millions of …

Shri Mataji: But UN may not be. You can say diplomat’s wife. “Many believe that She’s the prophesied Holy Ghost of the Bible.”

Yogi: Often when you speak to the newspapers on that point, Mother, they become extremely careful.

Shri Mataji: But you said that they are sensational type, another type.

Yogi: If they actually came and met You, what they would write would be unbelievable, I’m sure. They would really take it to an extreme.

Shri Mataji: I must read them.

Yogi: I think it would be a question of whether it would be appropriate.

Shri Mataji: Then why not?

Yogi: Okay.

Shri Mataji: “Claimed by many or [UNCLEAR] by many.” Something like that. It’s not that I claim but others say. 

Yogi: They’re always right there in the store.

Shri Mataji: But you think they’ll listen to you?

Yogi: It’s a great story.

Shri Mataji: Can you try that?

Yogi: Mother, we’ll try.

Shri Mataji: Where do you find them?

Yogi: They’re published in different places. I think in Florida, but their reporters are everywhere.

Shri Mataji: You should find out who are the reporters? You could ask these boys [UNCLEAR] and Company.

Yogi: Don’t know if they would like that idea.

Yogi: Maybe we could show Mother one of those papers.

Shri Mataji: If it is done by somebody else I don’t mind. As long as you don’t say that I claim. You could say, “Claimed by so many.” But don’t you think we had a good response yesterday?

Yogi: No.

Shri Mataji:  It was not so good, pretty ordinary?

Yogi: I think Monday maybe more.

I told that woman who was running the place that there was going to be controversy, beforehand. She said that was no problem. But I don’t think they were expecting [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] are vague people. They do it everywhere. We had one in Geneva. They became so furious we had to call the police. And the police came and they said, “You are here too? Again you are here.” As if he was some sort of a professional man doing that.

Yogi: Hired troublemakers.

No, I think that wasn’t so many, Mother. Better than last Los Angeles. It wasn’t what we were expecting.

Something over two hundred.

Shri Mataji: It depends on like Australia has more newspapers. Or we can say that – one of you can be called to be interviewed, also. You can say that She is the One. You all can say that, because She does counsel you, She does tell you all these thing, She does redeem you, gives you realization. Four – five of you can just tell who came [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: Usually they can make up their own story. They try to just get the sensational part out front with a Photograph.

Shri Mataji: These people can go and say that.

Yogi: Danny and I thought of doing that a long time ago, Mother.

Shri Mataji: It’s a good idea, I don’t mind. You people can do. If you take these people they can say that yes we do claim. You can say. Why not? You all can say.

Yogi: Let’s try this. I’ll get in there and say it.

Shri Mataji: You can claim. They can’t prosecute you for that.

Yogi: Why don’t You put it to the PR people, see if they can get us up front with the…

Shri Mataji: They should say that there are some people from Australia, other people, doctors. They claim that She is the Holy Ghost which is being proclaimed… There is no harm in that.

Yogi: Let’s have a go at it. Let’s do it. Let’s get into these people tomorrow, see if we can ring them and line them up for tomorrow – or even tonight.

Shri Mataji: You should say that you are fed up with the Christian nonsense. You are looking for answer for this, went round seeking a person who would be…

Yogi: I could say that I had done this reading into the scriptures…

Shri Mataji: All this and that’s how Gregoire did this with his newspaper and he actually claimed…

Yogi: There’s nothing wrong in that.

Shri Mataji: What did she say?

Yogi: She is worried that they might turn it into something ugly about You.

Shri Mataji: What?

Yogi: Or ridiculous.

Shri Mataji: How?

Yogi: They are sarcastic and cynical.

Shri Mataji: But how? If you claim something, why would they say something sarcastic. They should say, “She’s the one who understands consciousness, the one who talks about consciousness. She’s talked about all the religions, She’s talked about all the great people.” I don’t understand how we can be worried. If you go to the last limit, what can they say about it?  People who criticise Me the most are these news of the world. They said, “She’s the head of a sect, that’s all.” But if you talk to them you can say She doesn’t have any sect or anything.

Yogi: I think we can keep the standard of it high. They can’t mis-report it.

Shri Mataji: If you people go and speak…

Yogi: The way to stop them from mis-reporting it is to have the cameras there. That way if they distort anything at all then they’ve got a slander or liable suit on their hands which will cost them many millions of dollars.

Shri Mataji: That gets into left side. There are things like that. If you think like that then the thought works out. Don’t worry. There’s nothing to worry about is there? You can always claim something. 

Yogi: We did it in Sidney and we just said who She was and the audience shut up.

Shri Mataji: It’s a religion there. Americans are not so bad like English journalists. 

Yogi: I think the Americans will accept that. That audience that came and shook hands with You at the end of the program, Mother, is ready for that.

Shri Mataji: What I’m saying is not so bad as the English journalists are. Actually you don’t know how you stand with these English journalists. There I don’t think you can do like that. English journalists are becoming like barking dogs. Who is that horrible fellow – Robin Bey. People like him would not exist in any country but England because he is so arrogant, isn’t it? You can’t put slander on Me. They should know I am having a position if life. At the most what can they say. What is there a thing to worry. Somebody tried to criticize Me in India saying that people claimed She is Adishakti. She stole My photograph at My puja and she published it and people came in thousands after seeing the photograph. And then I heard that  horrible people came from…

Yogi: Had a double effect.

Shri Mataji: Six thousand people for that program in Delhi, can you imagine?

Yogi: My parents read that article.

Shri Mataji: [Mother talks of people having a big bar in the home.]
If you don’t have a bar, no Sikh will come to your house. They put all their money into it. Such stupid people. [UNCLEAR] which means service by only giving them something to drink. I haven’t seen any western home with a big bar in the first hall you enter into. Have you seen?

Yogi: Yeah, I have seen.

Yogi: In upper class quite a few of them. 

Shri Mataji: Not that kind, they have a cabinet or something

Yogi: Not a full bar.

Shri Mataji: Mm. It is just like a pub. That kind of a table.

Yogi: How do we get up front to our media people if we’ve got something more sensational.

Shri Mataji: No, you don’t worry on those points. What I’m saying, that you can claim anything. What is the harm when you can prove it also? That way they can publish all these ugly things about Me if they want to even after meeting Me. They do. So why to worry. Beforehand he could not form any ideas. Whatever comes forward we’ll face it then.

Yogi: The question arises now whether we want to make it a news item in the sense that I can say publicly at the program tonight who you are and so on and therefore he would stay in San Diego and they would have something with. But whether we have some sort of an interview lined up which I feel would be better in Los Angeles with these PR people who in turn would go to the other people.

Shri Mataji: The PR people, do they know about this? One of them is a Jew. That’s the problem.

Yogi: They are professional people.

Shri Mataji: You should say that you should use us for that, I mean as professionals, that we are claiming like this. You can ask them. Not that they are involved in it, they need not believe in it, but they can use you as professionals. It will give then a story. As long as you give them a story. 

Yogi: As long as we commission them they will do.

We’ve got to give them the line though, that we’re prepared to push and stand by.

Shri Mataji: Whatever is written in the newspaper has more impression, I think, I don’t know. In Los Angeles it may not be as you say. It has much more impression and you have something in the hand.

It’s a permanent record.

Yogi: The press agents, Paul and Larry, were both working very hard on newspapers for that very reason. But in fact you can put a press clipping into a book and that we did this whereas it’s much more difficult to put a radio interview or a television interview into something a client can turn over. They were actually working very hard to get the press to respond.

Shri Mataji: The press won’t have it without some sensational declaration is made about a person. There is no harm. We can even send you to the Pope. There’s no harm in declaring. That will have no repercussion on you, I’d say.

Yogi: The problem as we see it, Mother, is that we have looked some of the fringe publications here in California and there are page after page of people claiming to be various things. They claim to be the supreme being and they’re claiming to be all sorts of things and there’s page after page of that. Were it anywhere else but here it would be sensational. Here I rather feel they likely [UNCLEAR] that here is another one that claims to be.

Shri Mataji: It’s mundane. But why not? Let’s say it doesn’t matter.

Yogi: I mean we’re saying, not that She’s saying.

Shri Mataji: Why not? What’s the harm? I keep saying. It will have some effect.

Yogi: What’s in the back of my mind, Mother, is that last night’s incident may well lead to repercussions on the part of the church people tomorrow with those [UNCLEAR] whole lot of time.

Shri Mataji: Ah, nothing.

Yogi: But if there was a repercussion with the church people then all of a sudden there was a reason for story and a reason for something to happen.

Shri Mataji: No, no, Methodist church I have spoken not once here but many a times. They are not bothered about [UNCLEAR]. Everyone has freedom here to speak what they like. Methodist church is not bound because I have spoken at least – when I came in 1973 I spoke in a Methodist church and last year I spoke in a Methodist church, this year I spoke in a Methodist church, so no question. But today when these people come you can tell them that She’s the Holy Ghost and behave yourself. We can prove it to you She’s the Holy Ghost.

Yogi: There’s a newspaper interview here tomorrow morning, Mother.

Shri Mataji: We can have?

There is one already arranged in San Diego tomorrow morning. We could begin with that…

Shri Mataji: All right, you can say that there are people who claim. You can ask the interviewer to ask what we have to say.

Yogi: It only needs, Mother, for some of us to be present before You come in. You must be there and then let Mother come in and then when you come in…

Shri Mataji: All right. Let’s just leave it.

All say, “Jai Shri Mataji.”

Shri Mataji: I’m reminded that horrible Rajneesh claiming to be God. That’s another Mahishasura claiming to be God and then why not Me?

[UNCLEAR talking off mic]

Yogi: Karan didn’t bargain on this.

Karan: I’m very much looking forward to it. Very interesting day tomorrow. 

Yogi: After all what’s the name of this town? San Diego.

Shri Mataji: Dio is God. Saint of God. Los Angeles is…?

Yogi: Lost Angels.

Shri Mataji: Los is the plural. The angels. They are working here. They could be – can be. Thank you very much for the nice picnic.

Yogi: Mother, we have something from San Diego that we’d like to give You.

Shri Mataji: You are not yet married. You cannot give me a present if you are not married. Thank you very much. I hope it is not expensive. Otherwise I will not take. Little boys, you cannot give presents to Me. Oh, Baba, it’s so expensive. You cannot give Me this. It’s too much, too much. Mexican? Very beautiful. Let’s have a look. But it is too much, I tell you.

Yogi: Abalone shell, Mother.

Shri Mataji: This is abalone. Shell. Beauty. This is a very significant thing, though. In evolutionary stage, first of all. Then Vishnu became this and then the whole mantra was done on His back. Stage two. Very artistic piece. Conch shell?

Yogi: Abalone.

Shri Mataji: What does that mean?

Yogi: Kind of like an oyster. Shellfish. Crustacean.

Shri Mataji: Very beautiful. But it’s too much. I am embarrassed to take from you people such an expensive thing. Very beautiful.
