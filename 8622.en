1993-10-09 Persian Public Program, Los Angeles (USA)

I bow to all the seekers of truth. I’m very, very happy to meet you people from Iran. Because the first country I visited was Iran at the time of Shah (King) and I found there were many people who were seeking the truth and they had freedom to do that and we had very few people because I was staying with my brother and we didn’t have a program like this. But at least 20 people came to my brother’s place and got their Realization. 
After that, you know what happened in Iran and I lost completely contact with them. But even now there are some people who are in Iran and who have got their Realization. 

So, I think Iran is a very old country of great culture and before it becomes Islamic, it had Zoroastrians living there who had great philosophy also. Then these Islamic people also took to Islam in a very serious way. I don’t know but before Islam came the people used to make art with human figures and after that, they started making things of descrying were there were only flowers or cubes or geometrical drawings. It happened that. I went to Shiraz and I went to metropolis also. So all the places is full of Divine vibrations. That means there have been even before Mohammad five times Zoroaster came and then came Hazrat Mohammad who did such a lot of work for all of us. But I think there was a little problem which took place with that, people have twisted many things by which we are put into trouble for nothing at all.

Quran was not written by Mohammad Sahib, you know that. Because he did not know how to read and write. So he told about it to his friends who also did not know how to read and write. So then he the children of these, we should say his friends, they were educated and after forty years, after the death of Hazrat Mohammad Sahib, we can say, the Quran was written. At that time, before that also a big problem started. Because you are all Shias, I’m quite happy to tell you about what happened. That Abu-Bakr became the head of the Islam, Abu-Bakr and he was a fundamentalist. Actually, it was Hazrat Ali who had to become the head, Ali had to become. 

But some way or other Abu-Bakr managed. He was a very ambitious man to become the head of the Islam. Is a history I’m telling you. Now when he became, he tried to argue with Hazrat Ali and he said that whatever written in the Quran is alright and he added his own things also to it. Now Hazrat Ali you know had a fight with him. I know the whole history about it, because My father translated Quran into Hindi language, So I’ve read Quran also, quite nicely. 
Now, what happened? It’s a history where the turning point took place. As you know Hazrat Ali became head but later on, he was killed and his two sons were killed. And the wife of Mohammad Sahib, Aisha, was told that you will go and fight against the truth and you will know it when the dogs will bark. So when she went on the other side, it’s called as Hava [?], it happened and dogs started barking, but still, she didn’t listen and she went and told the other side of the people that “whatever is Abu-Bakr is saying is alright, you listen to Abu-Bakr”. So the drift started that time and as you know later on Hassan and Hussein both were killed in Karbala. That’s how Shia and Sunni two party started. 

I must say thank God you are Shias. Because Shias believe in many things which are the truth. One they believe that you will become a “wali” [spiritual guides, saints]. You have to become a wali. We have Hazrat Ali who was himself, according to our Sahaja Yoga, he was an Incarnation as Mohammad Sahib was. We worship Mohammad Sahib, Hazrat Ali and Fatima. For us, they are much more than you know in Quran, which later on you’ll find out how they are related to India. They are very, very great souls who came on this earth and because these fanatics didn’t understand them, they killed them. So then these Shias started feeling sad and having the "matam" [mourning; acts of lamentation], you know. For that they started wearing black clothes and having matam. But the time is over now. 

In that, most of the Quran was written according to Mohammad Sahib but I think something more was added by these people who read Bible. In the Quran, Christ has been praised, his mother has been praised, Moses has been praised, Abraham has been praised. And [Mohammed] said that there are- have been one lakh [a hundred thousand] walis before myself. And when he said also that: “I am the seal” it has double meaning. It doesn’t mean that he was completely finished, after him nothing will happen, but it meant that he was the stamp of a Wali, He was the stamp of a prophet. But Mohammad Sahib never said that he was divine. Because he knew that if he said he was divine, they will attack him and kill him also. So he never said he was divine but not he was divine, but he was the incarnation of a Primordial master.

Now, the only thing where we have gone wrong is one place, where we talk of Qiyamah. Qiyamah is the Resurrection. Resurrection time is described according to Bible. You don’t know how much bible has been ruined by John, John who is- I’m sorry not John- by Paul. Paul is the one who came into Christianity just to use a forum for himself. He was a political man and just wanted to use it. So he gave his own ideas and the most absurd idea he gave about Qiyamah was this: “That when the time of Qiyamah will come, then the bodies of the people will come out of the graves and they will get their Resurrection”. This is absurd! You know very well that in the graves what is left of a human being: nothing. His soul goes away and his body is there, which decays, decays and only the bones are left. So it’s absurd idea that people will come out of the graves after so many years and our forefathers also will come out of the graves, it’s impossible. You see, religion is logical. It is not absurd, it is not nonsense. It is the greatest sense, but we should understand how these things have been brought in. So the idea of Qiyamah was ruined. I think by Paul first to begin with and these people must have taken from there something of that. Because it’s an absurd idea. 

On the contrary, as Mohammad Sahib has said, there has been one lakh of walis, means there have been incarnations before. So, the idea of Qiyamah in the Indian scriptures is much more sensible in a way. Because it says that all the souls which are dead, which are hanging in different states will take birth when the Qiyamah time will come when the last judgment will come and it’s happening. That’s why you see, these days, there are such nice people, there are saints, there are such beautiful people and also at the same time you find there are such horrible, cruel, immoral, all types of people are born. Some of them look like animals also, worse than animals. 
So all these souls now are taking birth. And these souls are here for their Resurrection. Now, this is your Resurrection time, no doubt. This is the time when you have to be resurrected. And this Resurrection takes place luckily amass. 

Here we have few Iranian sitting but in say- I went to Russia we had never less than 16 thousand people, never less, always in a big stadium. Because it is the truth you have to know. So far, if we had known the absolute truth, there would have been no quarrel, no argument, no war. Everybody will think the same way, isn’t it? If it is one truth, then why you should think separately? Why should you sing separately? Everybody thinks the same way.
So this is what has to happen to us: is to know the absolute truth. To know- Please be seated now, don’t disturb- To know the absolute truth what has to be done? Because at human awareness we cannot know the absolute truth, at human awareness. If we had known, there would have been no problem. Everybody thinks differently. Somebody thinks this is truth, somebody. I mean if you ask Christian, according to him, the Muslims are the worst people. If you ask the Muslims, according to him, the Christians are the worst people. If you ask the Jews, they’ll say the Muslims are the worst, they all think they are the best. Is a wrong idea. Is absolutely wrong.
So to understand it fully, what we have to do is to know the absolute truth. And the source of absolute truth is your Atma, is your Spirit, is your Ruh. And that is what one has to know. 

Unless and until you feel the Ruh, unless and until you are connected to Ruh, you cannot know what is the truth. It is like this. You see, this instrument [mike] which is-if it is not connected to the mains, it has no meaning, it has no identity, it doesn’t work, it is useless, it won’t carry my voice. In the same way Namaz [prayer] is very great. But Namaz is what? Is nothing but for your Resurrection, a kind of a movement where you should get your Resurrection. 

The other day I had a Muslim gentleman who came to Me, because he had angina and all kinds of physical problems. So it was Namaz time. I said you do your Namaz now. He did his Namaz and he felt the Ruh at that time. He felt it. In the same way you have to first feel this Ruh which is around us. So what is the truth? The first truth is that you are not this body. You are not this mind. You are not these conditionings, these feelings, this ego. But what you are, you are the pure Spirit. That’s the first truth. Because you say my ego, my body, my mind. Who is this mind? Who is the owner? Who is this I who call itself "my"? So this one is the Spirit which is within ourselves. 

The second truth is that there is an All-pervading Power of divine love, which we call as Ruh. It’s all over. Now we see these flowers. It’s a miracle. It has come out of one seed. Everyone is different, every leaf is different. Every color is different. Who does all this living work? Who runs your heart? You ask a question to a doctor. He’ll say: "It’s autonomous system". But who is this "auto"? Who runs your heart? You have to find out who runs this heart ? And then we come to the point where we say we don’t know. Then if you go to the science, the science cannot answer many questions. First of all, science is amoral, there is no morality about science. It deals with matter. But when you ask a question, why are we on this earth? Science cannot answer this question.

So, we have to find out why are we on this earth? What is our purpose? Have we come here just to live, earn some money, pay some insurance and die? Is that our value? Have we got something more that we have to achieve? So, we have to find out that the purpose of our life, why we are here. Now You’ll be amazed [to] understand that this all is done, as he must have told you, through a power within us. Now this power is your individual mother. Everybody has this mother and this mother is knowing everything about you. She is the power of mother. Also, Abu-Bakr didn’t want to talk about women. He fought with Aicha and also later on he fought with everyone and he said that women do not count. That’s how they put the women on the other side. But Mohammad sahib respected women out and out. You see, despite every effort, there is so much of truth in the Quran. 

First of all, he said that a woman should be married. At that time, there were lots of war was going on, you know, as they were tribes. They even gave poison to Mohammad Sahib, horrible times! I don’t know you must have a great courage to enter in to these Arabic people, because they were very, very hot tempered people. But he said one thing: so many young people are dead and with this so many young people dead, what should women do? They will become prostitutes, there will be no family life. So, doesn’t matter, have five wives but marry. He didn’t want women to become prostitutes. And that’s why, to establish the sanctity of married life, he said: "Alright" at that time "to marry five wives, you can." But there are so many rules and regulations about it. It’s not compulsory, because you are a Muslim you must marry five times. 

Now people have misused all these things to a very great extent. That I’ll tell you in India we have a problem that women, we have a separate law for Muslims. So their men marry sometimes four times, have eight children, eight children. So many children and suddenly they say "Talaq, Talaq Talaq" [repudiation], finished! At this, three poor women, they are thrown out of the house and the "meher" [dower] is nothing. So just thrown out of the house and they are on the streets, absolutely living on the streets. 

One day I was travelling, I’ve had gone to one place and I saw on the, our car had stopped, because of some problem. There was one tap and women were coming to fill the water, absolutely very poor, I mean in India I’ve never seen such poor people. Extremely poor, their children absolutely bones, in such bad conditions! And I just couldn’t bear it, I mean, I felt then an ocean of compassion for them. And I asked them: "What is this? How are you like this?" Then they told Me the story: "This is what has happened and we have in no way help from anyone."

So, this nonsensical idea have brought some much of brutality and cruelty to women also. Now we have to understand that whatever Mohammad Sahib has done is for our good, for our benevolence. All this he told us to be moral people, because we have to be moral. If we are immoral then our humanity goes away. But he said you have to have Rahmat (blessing), Rahim, all the time he talked about love. Now so far, we have used hatred in the name of God, everywhere. We have used the power of hatred. But now the time has come to use the power of Love, of divine love. Because you can feel it. It’s all around you and you can feel it. If this realization takes place, you can feel it on your fingertips. This is what in the evolutionary process, now you are human beings and then just a little jump, just a little break through and you can feel it on your fingertips. We have so many Muslims from different countries like Algeria, also from France.

As you must have heard about Rouhani, Ayatollah. He was surprised the way I gave realization to thousands of people in Paris and they were of different races, different religions and different nationality and he was so sweet. I told him now you don’t have to wear black. Those days are over. Now you have to think of resurrection. So, he agreed and I had taken for him a white unique and white turban, so he wore it very sweetly and made me wear his turban also very sweetly. He was very very sweet and then he wants to go Algeria because there fundamentalists who were really very cruel. So, he asked me: Mother, what should I do? I said: see, now you are protected, you better go. Nothing to worry. He went there and I’m told he was very successful and he tried to control the fundamentalist and told them that the Qiyama time has come, now take to your Qiyama. That is how he solved the problem.

So now we have to live in peace. No more fighting, [UNCLEAR] to our children. In the name of God. These are some people who are interested in making money or getting power and making everybody fight. Now these Bosnia people I feel so sorry for them. One of them I met, happened to meet. So I asked him, I said: why are you fighting? Forget it. Now just accept whatever is there and these horrible Croatians and these. Serbs are terrible people. You just now give up and don’t starve and die. There are not only starving but they have nothing to eat, they are just frozen. It’s worse than gas chamber. Because gas chamber in a short time, but they in fifteen, twenty days they starve and then die. Just imagine. Only because they are Muslims. They are dying.

So, the reason he gave me was very bad. Because he said now you see we are dying in the name of God and we’ll be resurrected. If we are now died in the name of God, we’ll be resurrected. Absurd! Of course, not.

One should not care for this land, this, that. One should care for oneself and for the well- being of your own children. This fighting fighting going on, thank God Arafat has some sense, it’s a little bit less now. But still, still I would say that people have to take to peace, understand that we have to live in complete joy and happiness.

Now this Sahaja yoga is working in 55 nations. I’ve never seen these people quarreling with each other, fighting with each other, Saying bad things to each other. Of course, I mean they pull each other’s legs, you see, joke and all that. But that’s different. It’s lot of humor, all the time laughing and enjoying. When I was in Russia, they had this problem of the [Koo]. And I asked them, I said: Aren’t you worry? There is a [Koo] on. So They said: No mother. We are in the kingdom of God. Why should we worry about this Russian? It’s like that. So all this is within you reach and get it and really this will happen. God wants you to be happy. He wants you to be in the kingdom of God. He has created you to give you all this joy and happiness. You know a father, how he treats his son, Does he make him suffer? No, So God is the father of all the fathers. Why will he make you suffer? Think of that, is impossible. It’s a wrong idea that for religion you have to suffer, not at all. On the contrary, be kind to yourself. You are human beings and you all can get your realizations in no time. Only thing is, it is not meant for stupid people and idiotic people. There are many idiots also. I was surprised from Egypt we had some people.  [UNCLEAR] Would tell you the story. They were communism and they were 8 people who came and they said we want to have a conference on anti-Rationalism and anti-fundamentalism and 30 persons can come. you look after your food, everything but put us up in the hotel and we’ll have a conference. But then I just thought that this will happen automatically if you become the spirit, Automatically. Because you transcend. You become a different person all together. So, what’s the use of this? I said: alright, we’ll have a conference on self-knowledge or self-realization or Qiyama. He [UNCLEAR] there were Qiyama. Because they were communism, you see. So, I said alright. Let us have it on self-knowledge. So, what they told me that if this is the subject then only seven people will come and you have to pay for their travel also. So, I went to Budapest and asked what is this? Why do you want me to pay for your travel and only 7 people will come? So, you know what they said? This is a stupid part of it. They said that the idea of self-realization is yours. So, you must pay. The first one was our idea. These are Egyptians. I must say Iranians are much better. I’ve never seen such people. That it’s your idea to have the self-realization. do you pay for our travel? This was too much. I tell them, you see. Not the way, that I would like to [UNCLEAR]. So, I gave up. I mean I say I give up. It’s primitive. I mean you have no idea at all that what religion is and what you have to have? How can you say such a thing? I mean it is absurd and this absurd idea they gave me, then I gave up. I said: Ah, finished. With the Egyptians are communism, I don’t know from where they have learned these things than? They are unprincipled, you must pay. So, this is what it is.

You can understand, I know Iranians are very wise people compare to all other Muslims. But the problem is this fundamentalism that has gone into their heads. Iran is in a very bad shape. We have in no Iran shipping company. My husband was chairman of shipping corporation, he used to go to Iran and come back and they said shipping company working then he became secretary general of the maritime organization of the UN and that’s how we became in contact with lots of Iranians and lots of people who were living there. Among all these, I think they are the first ones, because they are also very ancient, very traditional. They will be the first one to take to resurrection, I have no doubt and it has worked I think I’m so happy to see you here. I was always hoping that I’ll meet you and this is your own that should happen. This is your own power, is all your own and you all should have it. There are very beautiful, nice people in Iran. I have very good experience of them. But only maybe, coming to this country, you might have become very materialistic. You were not so materialistic there. that much I know but I don’t know because coming to this mad country, everybody becomes materialistic, it’s such a materialistic country and people become very superficial. That’s also true, no doubt. But even Indians have become materialistic here. You know. It’s a funny country but still you have emotions, you have feelings for your families. It’s not that bad as it is with others. But I must say this country is quite mad in so many ways, you see. For example, somethings you will never do. I mean we Indians can never do something that they do like this lady Elizabeth Taylor getting married eight times. That’s alright. Then on top of that she got married and there were people, four thousand people went to see her honey moon. She married a very young person and there were ten helicopters hovering on their head and there were people who are coming down with parachutes to take her photograph. I mean this kind of a madness, I tell you Iranians cannot do, we Indians cannot do. It’s beyond us. I mean first of all if she has divorced eight times, nobody will go and see her. Because it is inauspicious to see such a person. So, it’s such a mad place. It’s alright but there are also very nice saint people, I mean he had lots of [UNCLEAR, seen]. American are sitting who have got realization and they don’t mind because they are the ones who told me all these things, what stupid things that they are doing here. See it happens, after realization they start finding their own faults and they relate to me: “Mother, we are like this, we are like this.” So, you start seeing you know clearly.

Now of course I think you can ask me some questions and then we can have realization. But this subject is very great. It’s like an ocean, the knowledge is like an ocean. Now when you come in this room, when you have to put on these lights, you just have to put on a switch and all the lights come. But if I have to tell you all the history of electricity, how it came to this place and How this that… it is a headache. So better is to put the lights on. First put the light on and in that you can know everything. In this short time, actually this meeting was arranged very [UNCLEAR, ad hoc] and despite that I’m so happy that you all could come and I could meet you. It was my heart’s desire to meet you. It has worked out. So, at this time I may not be able to tell you much about it. But if you have any questions you can ask. But as I said first of all we must have the light. Alright, come along.

[UNCLEAR]… A person welcome and thanks Shri Mataji for this program]

It is very promising, you see. Young people saying this. I don’t know how to thank you. To see young people saying this is extremely promising. Because you know what is the conditioning of young people here. What’s happening to them? They are going to drugs, absolutely and young people are to be saved today is very important. They must have right values, right understanding. Do you know that in Sahaja Yoga people have given up overnight, overnight they have given up drugs? Overnight alcoholism. I never say don’t. If I say don’t half of the people will go. So, it’s alright. I just say take your realization.

The case is like this that supposing there is darkness and my eyes are close or maybe open but darkness and I have a snake in my hand and I am [UNCLEAR opsonic] person. Some will tense me you have a snake in your hand. I’ll not give a pulsate. This is a rope. Why do you say such a thing? No! Till the snake bites me, I’ll go on holding. So, you have to have little light. Immediately you leave that snake without anybody telling. This is what has to happen that you all should have that and then you will realize how fantastic you are. How great you are, how glorious you are and what a great work for you to work for god. It flows to you this Ruh. Is something such a great happening, and it just become like an enlightened person. Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten many candles. You can give realization to so many people. Only thing you have to little bit practice it and understand it. You go into three stages as I told you that first of all you become thoughtlessly aware. You come in the present, you don’t think but you are aware that you are in the present. The second state is where you are doubtlessly aware, where you have no doubts. Then you start giving realization to people, curing people. As a result of this happening this kundalini, your centers get corrected, they get integrated, nourished and also, they are enlightened. These are the centers which are our fundamentals and they look after our mental, physical, emotional and spiritual being. As a result, you can get cured also. I must say that we have seen people being cured of cancer, of lunacy, epilepsy, asthma even AIDS, even AIDS. And after getting this you don’t get sick and if you get sick, you know you are getting sick. It’s something is the self-knowledge you get first of all you know about yourself, about your centers and also you know the centers of others. Because you develop a new dimension within you, the collective consciousness. When we say Allah-u-Akbar. Akbar the great. When you say that. You just say it with the lip but then you become part and parcel of Akbar. You can feel others. Who is the other then? You can feel others on your fingertips. Now if you know how to correct the centers, you can correct others and also you can correct yourself. Now there are many doctors who are doing this such on them, we have a very great doctor who has come here from London. He is looking after seven hospitals and we have some doctors who have got their MD through Sahaja Yoga, who have shown epilepsy, asthma, all diseases. These diseases can be cured, is all tangible. It’s all tangible. It’s all your own power and you become that fantastic thing. It’s like say you take one television set to a remote village somewhere. Where they have never known electricity and you tell them from this box you can see lots of films and things. They say this is just a box. That’s what we think about ourselves. We are just a box. No, we are not. Once we are connected, then we are so fantastic that we start wondering how is it I never knew all these things that I have all these powers within myself. Thank you very much for saying nice thing.

AN AUDIENCE: We have five doctors… Persian doctors.

Shri Mataji: Five what?

AN AUDIENCE: Five doctors, Iranian doctors are in the audience. We have five doctors. Iranian doctors.

Shri Mataji: What is she talking with me?

Yogi: She said in audience we have five doctors here.

Shri Mataji: Here?

Yogi: Yes, five doctors.

AN AUDIENCE: Today, Today We have five doctors here.

AN AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR] … Asking about spirit and spiritual ascent.

Shri Mataji: now you become the medium of God. See now you become the medium of God. His powers start flowing through you and what’s you know the laws of divine laws. Then you become a saint, become a Wali. That’s what it is and once this light when it was not enlightened, you see it was needed a light. Once it got the light, it is giving the light. That’s what happen.

AN AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR] Do we need the body?

Shri Mataji: of course, This is a body which can only reflects the spirit. You see the idea that in the air you will be, No No. This body is very important and this body is needed because in the body is this mechanism and in the body only this will be reflected. So very important it is. Not only but after realization you need it more. Now see I am 70 years of age myself and still I’m going strong because this body is needed for people. I think this is going on and on and on and I travel, All the time I’m travelling. That’s all.

Shri Mataji: what is she saying?

AN AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR]… Asking about centers there.

Shri Mataji: Yes, we have. We have a very good center in L.A. very surprising and the leader of this center is sitting there, [the name of the leader is UNCLEAR] get up and he is the leader and he is the one who is looking after this place but I don’t know the address exactly where we are. But whatever [UNCLEAR] you have. One thing is you cannot pay for it. You cannot. It’s a living process. As you do not pay to your mother earth for getting this flowers you cannot pay for it. God doesn’t understand money. Please remember this. He doesn’t understand money, he doesn’t understand bank. So, all those people who are collecting money in the name of god and spirituality, know that they are Hypocrites.

Shri Mataji: alright? Should we have realization? You have to ask me something?

An AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: you are going back?

An AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: in Tehran, there are people who are doing.

Shri Mataji: In Tehran?

SHRI AMATJI: and how many people you have who are doing Sahaja Yoga in Tehran?

An AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR]… 10 Yoginis and one yogi…[UNCLEAR] Is it possible to have center in Iran and when [UNCLEAR]…

Shri Mataji: you see all my attention is there and all this nonsense must finish. It’s in a terrible mess, Iran I know. People are in a terrible condition. They are fighting. It’s terrible because you know I know the first-hand news from there. We have I told you the company is Hind-o-Iran. Shipping company is there. it’s so sad even the children are in a bad shape. All my attention is there and I’m sure within one year’s time should happen… it should happen. Everywhere something is happening. Maybe they all should understand what is Qiyamma is and give up this nonsense of fighting. Even the children are fighting. They are carrying pistols and all that. Now he asked me a very nice question, what is your religion now? To be very frank my religion is a universal religion. This is the religion that Gandhiji, mahatma Gandhi preached. That we not only respect but we worship Mohammad sahib, Hazrat Ali, Fatima Bi, all of them. Worship. Also, we worship Christ. We worship Moses, also we worship Shri Krishna and Shri ram. Because they are all flowers of the same tree of Spirituality. At different times, they came. So, what we’ve done? We have plucked the flowers, plucked the flowers and we are fighting with the dead flowers. Once you get your realization, you will know what I’m saying is absolute truth. Because it’s a truth. When the truth is there, you know on your fingertips. Some people don’t believe in God. Just ask them the question, is there God? Three times they ask, they start getting the Ruh on Their hand. That’s how you can make out the truth. You were born say in a Islam religion, so you are Islam. Supposing you are born in Jew, then you would have been a Jew. It’s just a chance. But once you are a realized soul, you understand that they are all one. We are the ones who are fighting. So, we believe in a universal pure religion, which is within ourselves. Another thing is say a Muslim, for [UNCLEAR] I was in Riyadh with my daughter. I was coming from Riyadh and we got to the plane to London I was going and I had gone off to sleep. When I woke up, I found all different people. Ladies They wearing skirts six inches, smoking. I said who are these ladies and the men who are wearing very dandyish type. I said who are these men? They said they are the same. I thought the plane has landed somewhere else. No No they are the same. That means Muslim religion is just lip service. Nothing inside. So, a Muslim can do any crime. A Hindu can do any crime. A Christian can do any crime. But after realization you become really a real Muslim, become a real Christian and real Hindu. Because you just don’t do wrong things, you become righteous. It is the becoming. You become religious. We have religion, our religion is outside. Absolutely outside. But it becomes inside. Innately. So, this is a innate universal religion which is pure religion we follow and we respect every one of them. Alright. That’s a good idea.

Do you believe the Pop and Imam Khomeini? What does that pop means Pop? No not at all. They are just the same. Useless people. Not at all. How can I believe? There is no truth about them. If you want to know I can tell you hundred things about them. How horrible they are. Useless.

Do you believe Imam Zaman Mehdi, who is he?

Yogi: Mehdi

Shri Mataji: Twelfth Imam, The Mehdi? Of course, You will find out who is that, Alright?

Do you Believe in Bahayi? No No No not at all. Bahayi is all not correct. No, it’s not correct. Bahayi is not a prophet.

Are you a new Prophet? OH, This I will not tell you. You see Mohammad Sahib did not tell that he was divine. Of course, that truth I cannot deny because you will know very soon that I am Divine. But I will not say anything about myself. You see Christ was the son of God. Despite that they crucified him. Mohammad Sahib was the Prophet. They gave him poison. I don’t want to get killed. No I don’t want to tell anything about myself, alright?

Because people are so stupid. If you tell them I’m a prophet, tomorrow they’ll be there with the swords cutting my throat.

AN AUDIENCE: you are an Angel.

Shri Mataji: now you have to find out. When you find out, then believe. You should not blindly believe in anything. because you blindly believe in everything and what happen? Now first get your enlightenment and then believe not before that. Nobody should believe blindly. It’s no use. Alright?

So should we now… have you finished or you are asking some questions?

AN AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR] asking about culture and tradition.

Shri Mataji: culture you see should be natural and moral. But all the culture that we follow is according to the Ruh. The vibrations. Supposing you see we have stupid cultures all over, but what is good and what is bad. We cannot discriminate normally. So, on vibrations, you can ask. But automatically people become, you know, religious. I don’t have to tell you. Now you know in the west Christ has said that “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.” what a subtle thing. Even the eyes should be without lust and greed. But look at these Christians. All their eyes are moving like this, like that on women. So, after Sahaja Yoga eyes become innocent. Your attention becomes so innocent. Not only that, But the attention becomes active. In Is the becoming, again again again I’ll say it’s not just talking and sermon and lecture. But it is becoming of you is important. You become that. Alright? You become religious. Is there any other question or should we have our realization? Yes please.

AN AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: alright… Sit down. Now see first what I have said that we have to have the light. Then I have to teach you any lessons. You become your own master. Your own prophet. In the light, you know everything. Of course, I mean if you ask me anything I will tell you. But you see you become so wise yourself. Suddenly you grow. So, I’m not going to tell you do this, do that, nothing. I just say take your realization. That’s all to begin with and then you will know what is to be done. I’m sorry madam I don’t know any Iranian but some words I knew also I have forgotten now.

An AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR]… asking about dreams and night mares.

Shri Mataji: I don’t believe in them but they are there, no doubt, yes.

AN AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR] they become true?

Shri Mataji: not necessary. Not necessary. That different types of dreams you have and they come from different sources. This all will be known in Sahaja Yoga. Alright?

Now you will have no night mares and very few dreams after realization. No fear nothing, Finished. No worry. No tension. Nothing. So, it’s your own.

AN AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR] asking about Karmas.

Shri Mataji: Karmas? Ah… you see all these karmas come to us through our believe that we are doing something. Alright? Now here is the you see is here. When this center in the optic chiasma here, you see when it opens out and the kundalini passes through it. It sucks in both the things. One side is your karmas, another side is your conditionings. Both are sucked in. then what happens? Then you go in to akarma. Means you don’t think you are doing anything. It’s just happening. It’s happening. You talk in third person. You don’t say I believe. Because we believe that we did it, that’s why we think we have done the karmas. I think the I is not there, then no more karmas, finished. Alright? That theory was eight thousand years back. Now today is over.

So, should we have the realization? Ha... yes.

AN AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR] asking about bahayi.

Shri Mataji: because bahayi has not done any resurrection work. They just making money and building big big bahayi temples. That’s all.  Are we on this earth to build temples and mosques and this and that? We’ve had enough of them. What have they done? You see we should see the work they have done. What work have they done? Nothing. Just somehow rather they make money. I don’t know how and they build very nice, big big temples that’s all. That’s how going to achieve anything. Is the same that the one who meets you god is a real master. The rest is all nonsense. What is there in building this place or that place, you see. In India one king built Taj Mahal, so what? They can call him godly person? Or a religious person? Alright? He built a big Taj Mahal, finished. Or there is dining tower of Pizza. So, what? We don’t call them godly people. Alright. they are building nice buildings, alright good idea. But they are not religious people. It’s logically. Logically when you reach that point you will understand that first thing is that it has to be spiritual. And spiritual doesn’t mean talk talk talk talk spiritual. People talk too much. Is it? talk has been too much. What have they done to human beings? I tell you once I was travelling by plane, but two bahayi sitting, one this side and one that side. Both were emitting such horrible heat from their body that I have to get up and go and both were fighting. You must see their disciples, you must see the people who are following that person. What sort of a life they lead? Are they moral people? Are they good people? What have they done? What have they achieved? Isn’t it?

Hah, first is do you believe life after death? Of course, Of course, There is life after death. But we should worry about the present, not what will happen to us. Alright? Once you get your realization you will just play with your death. It’s nothing. Just a joke. So, this is.

Do you believe in Paradise? Yes of course. You have to enter in to paradise means the kingdom of god which you will enter. Alright?

Do you believe religious political mix? No. but once we had the people who are religiously enlightened, then the government also will be religiously enlightened. That’s how this means the mix up is not good.

So, who is last prophet in the world? That’s what I will not tell you. Because this case has created lots of problems.

Are you vegetarian or you eat meat? No I do eat meat. I cannot be vegetarian and try to understand what’s the use of saving chickens. Am I going to give realization to the chickens or to goats? This is all sad. Vegetarian is all this that. In India, we have vegetarians such hot tempered people they are. That though they are vegetarians, they are good for nothing, useless, absolutely. quarrelsome. Fighting. See whatever soothes your body you should eat. Eating is not so important after Sahaja Yoga. You eat whatever you get. You’ll just enjoy yourself. That’s all. You never get bored. It doesn’t become so important.

Now are there more questions?

AN AUDIENCE: is the last one…

Shri Mataji: Ok.

AN AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR] in one dollar says here in god we trust. You see here? In god we trust

Shri Mataji: they all talk like that.

AN AUDIENCE: This is the political dollar.

Shri Mataji: Yeah, Yeah

AN AUDIENCE: Governmental Dollar,

Shri Mataji: Oh, I know

AN AUDIENCE: It’s not my dollar. Is political dollar. American dollar.

Shri Mataji:  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.

AN AUDIENCE: For money we have to trust god. You know and what is your [UNCLEAR] whatever is not political are religious. Everyday meaning you remember god, you know and {UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: You better ask them

AN AUDIENCE: No I ask you. This not advertising for Christian and to people always remember the god?

Shri Mataji: Yeah, must be.

AN AUDIENCE: In America or in the world?

Shri Mataji: You see it is true.

AN AUDIENCE: what you think [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: I tell you they do it everywhere. Like this. In God, we trust alright. Trust then. Is alright.

AN AUDIENCE: Ok.

Shri Mataji: If God is one what is there to fight? You see your god is the same and their god is the same. This what they don’t realize. There is no Christian God. Muslim God. Hindu god. Only one God.

AN AUDIENCE: [UNCLEAR]… asking about killing animals.

Shri Mataji: I don’t kill. I don’t kill. But they are killed by somebody. and there is no harm. We are killing human beings, first stop that. We are more worry about animals than about human beings. You see, I’m not going to give realization to animals and if you eat animals, it not going to harm to them. On the contrary in evolutionary process they improved.

AN UDIENCE: [UNCLEAR]… asking about suffering the animals during killing.

Shri Mataji: it is alright?

Actually, they don’t know the pain part but you see they are ways by which you can reduce their pain also. The ways of reducing pains but we need meat. important. See, those people who are eating too much meat, should eat vegetarian. Because they are very aggressive people. Those who are not at all eating like Indians you know. They don’t eat. So, they should eat meat I think. Because they are very weak people. Supposing an Iranian slaps an Indian, he’ll go just flat on the road. Not only that your meat but you have almonds and everything in your country. So, you are much healthier people. No doubt. So, if you stop eating that would be alright for you. Doesn’t matter. It’s a balance. You must have a balance.

So, this is a long subject which has been asked that where does the spirit goes and about spirit and power of God and the body what spirit goes and all that. I have given many lectures on this subject which you can always hear, alright? And just now I wanted you worry about present not the future. Alright?

So that’s what it is. But it’s important which you will know I have many lectures for this subject. I mean in in  English language I think 4 thousand lectures must be and I know in many other languages. So you can imagine I’m just lecturing, lecturing, lecturing all the time. That’s what it. But it is not the lecture that is important. What is important is your realization.

Alright now should we have the realization? Now my question, should we have the realization?

AUDIENCES: Yes

Shri Mataji: Alright. There is one thing I must tell you at the very outset that I cannot force self-realization on you. I cannot force. It’s your freedom. Whether you want it or you don’t want it. If you don’t want, then you should leave the hall. But if you want it you’ll get it. But I cannot force. Because this power that I’m telling is the power of pure desire, this power. Other desires as you know in economics, are not satiable in general. This is the only desire which of it one should not be aware. Which gives you complete satisfaction. So, those who do not want, I cannot force on them. So please, those who do not want to have, should leave the hall and leave others to do it. It takes hardly ten minutes to do it. If someday ask questions I know is going to go out. That’s the sign. Because they just want to have mental acrobats and I’m very good at answering questions because I have been doing this for so many years now. I met all kinds of people but they are all mental acrobats. There of no help. What you have to have is your realization. That’s the main thing. And there is one small thing I have to request that you have to take out your shoes because this mother earth helps us a lot. There is one simple condition. I should say that they are three conditions which are very very simple. The first one is that you have to be absolutely confident that you all will get your realization through that. That tonight you all will get your self-realization. Be completely confident about it. Alright, so the first condition is that. So, this condition follows that you should have no guilt of any kind in your mind just now, no guilt. I’ve must seen her. I must have done this. You see I drink, doesn’t matter whatever you might do. To err is human, to forgive is divine. All pervading power of this divine love is the ocean of forgiveness. and at this time, you forgive yourself, completely. Have no guilt for anything whatsoever. Means forget your past. Also, I tell you if you have guilt, what happens at the center we have on the left-hand side catches very badly. When they tell, you are the sinner, This, that. This center catches. Very bad center. And when this center catches you get a disease called angina, spondylitis and lethargic organs, it causes many problems. So, what’s the use of feeling guilty. Now supposing you have done some mistake. Take it, alright. If you have done some mistake, then face it and at that point forget it. Face that, forget it. Don’t keep it here. I mean I have seen people feeling guilty, I drop coffee here. So, doesn’t matter. what is it if you drop coffee? For small small things, they go on worrying. I should not have done this. I should not have done this. Nothing to worry. Whatever you have done is alright and God forgives you. Believe me. He is your father. He wants you to enter into his kingdom. So, you don’t have to really punish yourself and judge yourself. This kundalini will judge. She will judge you.

If some people want to come in front they can. There is room here.

You can come here. There is room for you.

Alright, so the second condition I’ve told you not to feel guilty about anything at this moment please. It’s very important. Because this center is caught, then kundalini cannot pierce to. Then the third condition is even simpler. Is to forgive everyone. Not to think about them. Just don’t think about them, in general. Now logically whether you forgive or you don’t forgive what do you do? You don’t do anything. But when you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. The one who has hurt you or troubled you Is happy, while you are torturing yourself. But at this moment this center here on the optic chiasma is like this and if you have to open, you have to forgive. Otherwise very constricted. If you don’t forgive, kundalini will stop at this point. So please forgive everyone, don’t even think about them. Because It’s a headache. Just saying [UNCLEAR], finished. Just forget. Everyone. You’ll feel much lighter. Just forget.

Now as you have seen here, we have two powers, left and right. The left power is the power of desire. Normal desire and kundalini is the power of pure desire. And the right one is the power of action. So, we use our left and right separately. It will hardly take 10 to 15 minutes for you to get realization, absolutely. Not more than that. It’s very simple. Because I said is built in within you, it is there. alright.

So first you have to put your left hand towards me like this. you can keep it here. It is recording in any way. Alright. So, and left hand like this and the both feet away from each other. Now you have to sit comfortably, not slouchy but comfortably. You have to sit very comfortably. You don’t have to go to Himalayas to stand on your head and nothing of the kind. you have to be extremely comfortable. Put the left hand like this and the right hand you have to use for nourishing your centers which is showing here, your heart first. In the heart resides the spirit, in the heart. Put it on the knee, it will be better. In the heart reside the spirit. Now please put left hand towards me and right hand inside inside the, alright.

Now we keep left hand like this which is suggestive or symbolic that we desire to have our self-realization. Only we move our right hand on the left-hand side. So now, then we take our right hand in the upper portion of abdomen on the left-hand side. Now this is the center of our mastery, mastery. It created by great prophets and great seers and saints. Also, Mohammad Sahib. It’s created by them, by Ali specially. Then we take our right hand in the lower portion of our abdomen and press it hard. Lower portion of it. This is the center of pure divine knowledge. It’s surprising it is here. Pure divine knowledge, which manifests on your central nervous system. By which you know that you have become divine and you can use your power. That starts manifesting. Now raise your right hand on upper portion of your abdomen. Now in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to right, tight hand, right hand. It’s correct. To the right. Now I’ve already told you that when this center is in trouble what happens.

Now please raise your right hand on top of your forehead and bend your head as far as possible. this is the center where you have to forgive everyone in general. Full hand, full hand, across like that. Alright.

Now please take this hand at the back side of your head, here the back side hold it tight and push back your head. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this divine power that is Ruh.

Now stretch your palm, fully. This is very important. Last center. Stretch your palm and put it on top of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood, please put the center of your palm. Now here you have to push back, backward your fingers, so that there is a good pressure on your skull. Now please bend your head. Now here you have to move your skull with the pressure, seven times clockwise. This is the most important center. Bend your head, bend your head. Little bit, Ha. Bend your head. Bend your head, please.

Now push back your fingers. You didn’t push back. now that’s all we have to do.

You have to now remember to put both feet apart and left hand like this and then you have to close your eyes. Before closing the eyes, I have to tell you that you don’t have to open your eyes till I tell you.

Now put your right hand. Please close your eyes. Not very tight. Just mildly. But not open at all. Put your right hand on your heart. Now here you have to ask me a very fundamental question about yourself in your heart not loudly, you can call me mother or Shri Mataji. “Mother, am I the spirit?” You ask yourself. “Mother, am I the spirit?” three times.

Now please take down your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. Here you have to ask another fundamental question about yourself. Please ask three times: “Mother, am I my own master?” Ask this question three times.

Now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here is the center which has got six petals. I have to tell you that I cannot force divine pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. Please ask six times: “Mother, please give me pure divine knowledge.” As soon as you ask for pure divine knowledge your kundalini starts rising. So we have to nourish higher centers with our self-confidence.

So now please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here you have to say ten times with full confidence: “Mother, I am my own master.” I’ve already told you that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego but you are the pure spirit.

So now raise your right hand on your heart and here we have to say with full confidence twelve times: “Mother, I am the pure spirit.” This all-pervading power, Ruh is the ocean of compassion and love, is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of bliss and joy. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistake you commit it forgives your mistakes and completely dissolved by the power of this ocean of Love.

So please forgive yourself and raise your hand in the cornet of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to the right. Here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence in yourself: “Mother, I am not guilty at all.” Say please sixteen times: “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

I have already explained to you whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you make yourself miserable and play into wrong hands. This you have done already to yourself but at this moment if you don’t forgive this center of Agnya will not open and the kundalini won’t come up. So please, please raise your right hand on your forehead across and please put down your head and here please say from your heart, not how many times: “Mother, I forgive everyone in general.” Say it from your heart. Not how many times. It’s very important. If you don’t say this from your heart, this won’t open and you’ll again miss the chance of self- realization.

Now, please take your right hand at the back side of your head. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistake, just for your satisfaction you have to ask for forgiveness from the divine power. So please say: “Oh all-pervading divine power or oh Ruh, please forgive me if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly.” Say it again from your heart. Not how many times. Please push back your head, please say it from your heart. Not how many times.

Now stretch your palm and put this center of the palm on top of the fontanel bone area and push back your fingers as far as possible. This is very important. There has to be pressure on your skull. Now you bend your head. Here again I cannot force self-realization on you. You have to ask for it. So please bend your head and move your skull seven times slowly, saying seven times: “Mother, please give me my self-realization.” say it seven times.

Yes, on the head and push back your fingers. Push back and now press it hard and move it seven times.

[Shri Mataji Blowing in the Microphone]

May God bless you. Now open your eyes. Now please both your hands towards me and watch me without thinking, just try. Can you do it? Watch me without thinking. Now just put this right hand towards me like this and bend your head and with the left hand please see if there is any cool or hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Sometimes it comes very far away also. Don’t put your hand on top of the head but away from it and see for yourself there is a cool or hot breeze coming out of your head. Some people get it far away as I told you. If it is hot that means you have not forgiven. So please forgive. The heat is coming up, it’s alright.

Now, try with the left hand again. Put the left hand towards me and put down your head and see for yourself with the right hand and see for yourself if there is a cool or hot breeze is coming out of your fontanel bone area. Please put the right hand towards me. Bend your head and now see for yourself, if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your heads. See with your left hand.

Hmm… Good. Now please both your hands towards the sky and push back your head and ask a question, anyone of these three questions. Ask anyone of them: “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” or “Mother, is this the all-pervading power of Ruh? Or “Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya?” ask anyone of these questions three times. Push back your heads a little bit. See upward.

Alright. Take down your hands. Feel very relaxed first of all. Now all those who have felt cool or hot breeze from their fontanel bone area or on their fingertips or on their palms, please raise both your hands.

I know, I know. All the Iranians have got it. May god bless you. May god bless you. You all have got it. Among Islam, Iranians will be the first, I knew will get it. This is Qiyamma. You ask a question: “Mother, is it Qiyamma?” just ask a question. Put your hands: “Mother, is it Qiyamma? Is it our resurrection?” just ask a question. See and there is a shine in your eyes if you see. You can see each other and now you will enjoy. It’s there. Just enjoy yourself.

But now you don’t have to pay at all for anything but this is the sprouting as we can call is the beginning, you’ve felt the Ruh. But you have to grow and for that we have a center here where they will call you for a follow on. those who didn’t get also should come. All of you should come and they will see and tell you and teach you and make you experts. Some people become experts within find their styles. But some take about a month and then you start giving realization to other Iranians. You can do it. It’s very simple and it is absurd, you feel free. It’s not that in one lecture you say something and there is a catch nothing. don’t have to pay at all. Any your problem, anyone of your problem. Physical, mental, family, social, anything, any problem. You can write to me. Alright? I’m with you. I’m your Mother. All the time and I love you very much.

May God Bless you.

Beautiful. Beautiful, He’s got it. He’s got very well. See this gentleman. His vibrations, is very good. You got it. I know you got it. But now don’t waste it. Because you have to come to the collective. It’s a collective happening. It is a collective happening. Supposing it is a nail is cut. It won’t grow. You have to come. Understand. Gradually you know all about it. About me. About everything. She’s got it. She’s got it. Yeah yeah. Let them, let this boy. You see, see on your head. You see on their head. You see. You can see also.

AN AUDIENCE: [ UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: it’s something happening, no doubt. Isn’t it? It’s like the mother earth, now Alright? So, you are the seeds, so you have to sprouted, finished. No obligation, nothing. Is my job, is my job, is my love. I can’t help it. Alright? May God bless you. May God bless you.

So when you come, they will tell you all about it. Gradually you have to grow into it. They will tell you all. Watch your faces have changed.

Did she feel? No that’s what I know.

She’s Got it. You’ve got it now. Alright?  [UNCLEAR] thoughtless awareness. Such good vibrations Iranian have special.

So, this the real Jihad now. This the second Jihad. Is to evolve. That one Jihad is over now. This is the second Jihad. The first Jihad when Mohammad Sahib had to fight and now it Is the second Jihad when we have become one with Akbar.

May God bless you. Thank you.
