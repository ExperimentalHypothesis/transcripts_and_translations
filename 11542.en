Informal Talk. Mr Ng’s house. Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia. 2 November 1990.

During the initial few mins of the talk, Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi interspersed with some English words. Shri Mataji appears to have done some shopping and asks the man “You are saying that you will give 50% concession” after which the man is explaining that if it is a 200% export there will be a duty of only 1%. In reply, Shri Mataji says, “no duty and no income tax” and “also your material is at half price. It’s tremendous...”

(The English talk begins here.)

Shri Mataji: ( Laughter) [UNCLEAR] This they used for the bridegrooms (referring to the headgear worn by Sahaja Yogis). (Laughter) But they can come as their ... can come as their father, uncle or someone else.... I had to tie it for so many of them myself with my own hands. When your wedding who tie?

Sahaja Yogi: It was a different one, Mother. It was a [UNCLEAR]...

Shri Mataji: Another type?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, another type.

Shri Mataji: When we had it in Delhi, we had 16 marriages. There we use this type. So they did not know   how to tie this style so I tied up for everyone. And the television came to see who has got 16 sons to marry like this (Laughter). That was the first. Now of course .... It was the seventies ... It’s terrible. Marriage is a ... last minute one fellow appears from somewhere. He ... did not know how to wear the dhoti.

Sahaja Yogi: Must be fun.

Shri Mataji: Such fun it is... (Silence) ... Great fun. Ganapatipule is nothing but fun (Laughter) because it is very spartan. Now we built up something for you. I hope it is all right. I have not seen it. But now we have built up about 7 or 9 dormitories something like that. Big rooms she has. So... permanently. Covered with grass roofs with the (attached?) ...[UNCLEAR] ... I am sure it is better than what it was. And the bathrooms are permanently made. Beautiful bathrooms. Let us see now how it works out. Even in {Pave?} thanks to this Mr Warren ... When he left me I could save some money. I do not know how, know how much he contributed... the money. I suppose pound also has gone up very much. But still, Warren was another lesson to me. Gavin. Same thing with Gavin... [UNCLEAR]... But the saving has been so much these three years. We could build so many things. I built an ashram in New Delhi. Very big one...[UNCLEAR] ...built one ashram in Vashi. One big one in Ganapatipule. Bought the lands. I do not know what was this fellow was doing. But they are saying that they had about 300,000 pounds with them. It is too much. ...[UNCLEAR}... His wife told me he perhaps has cancer. He is vomiting blood and all. It is too much. [UNCLEAR]. I would have known you know. We di not have a proper committee... everything. I do not know how he managed. Very clever.

Sahaja Yogini: Very clever.

Sahaja Yogi: Very silly, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Very silly.

Sahaja Yogi:  Very silly.

Shri Mataji: Of course .... I did not say that how much ...[UNCLEAR]... it has doubled down. But still the amount of money I have saved and I have been able to achieve ...cannot understand. This is the fourth year ...(Silence).

Now there will be permanent bathrooms for you in Vashi, (Lucknow?) and also in Ganapatipule. Bathrooms and WC . And now you can also start... that of course I was telling you 21 ashram (drafts?) of India [UNCLEAR] same like Ganapatipule... because they have not been able to do the [window?] ... I said  forget it. Just now there is no need...(Silence)... They are real (thieves?) I tell you. Even Terence did the same I think. They collected money for some sort of project. I don’t know which project they gave.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s a...  India Project... [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: What was the need to give cash for them?

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR)

Shri Mataji: What was the need [UNCLEAR}

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: American Dollars ...

Shri Mataji: Warren and company.  Terence and Warren ...They made such a lot of money out of Sahaja Yoga. I just don’t understand (UNCLEAR]. [Hindi]

Last 3 years only I have been saving such a lot of money. I don’t know what they have been up to.

Are these India project [UNCLEAR] or ...

See that lady came and approached us. I did not know about it ... But one thing nobody tells me na. You must tell me what’s happening. How am I to know? Nobody told me anything. I told everyone. Anybody ask you for extra money let me know. Even to (UNCLEAR). You can always write to me telephone to me ... (Pause). Even [UNCLEAR} as well and he behaved in such a manner know... I mean you cannot have any contact with him. ...  his [UNCLEAR] has gone off. The other day he came to receive his wife. I said call him but he said I would not come because [UNCLEAR] I’m not all right in my dress for Mother...[UNCLEAR] protocol... He never came. He never came. Otherwise I would have asked what about this India project business. Even if have ...(Pauses)...He is going to give some cock and bull story  (UNCLEAR).

Sahaja Yogi: I think a lot of the money probably when he got back to Australia...(UNCLEAR)...he bought a car, practice, he got into  a practice, a house, driving a Mercedes...

Shri Mataji: His wife was telling he’s got lots of money.

Sahaja Yogi:  So this is where ...[UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: From where did he get it?

Sahaja Yogi: (UNCLEAR)

Shri Mataji: But I told Steven don’t have a fight with his kids. Because they will go and do propaganda against Sahaja Yoga. Be friendly with him. Gradually we will see that he goes off. So he was rather friendly. Because I said that these people are very, very dangerous. Asked him to just make peace do not fight. Even with Warren. But James was not such a bad man... But why? (Pauses)...(In Hindi). You see if you had given any money...Indian Sahaja Yogis are extremely honest because they are afraid of me. They know what it is. They’ll never touch it. The trustee is my brother only, the chartered accountant, Baba Mama. I have not get to my trustee. You better go and check. Because I must have someone to check it because I have no time. He told me he has never come across such honest people, the way keep all the money, the way they look after it.

[Shri Mataji looks at a Sahaja Yogini.]

Shri Mataji: What is your name?

Sahaja Yogini: Sheila.

(Shri Mataji looks at another Sahaja Yogini.)

Shri Mataji: You are with the same ...which family?

Sahaja Yogini: Myself? Different family....(UNCLEAR)

Shri Mataji: You see that gentleman? What’s his name?... the other Indian...the old one.

Sahaja Yogini: No. No. I’m different. Different family.

Shri Mataji: You are not related to him.

Sahaja Yogini: No.

Shri Mataji: What’s his name? Ariaratnam or something.

Sahaja Yogini: Rajaratnam is it, Mother? Rajaratnam? Ariaratnam.

Shri Mataji: He has been to gurus something like that ... I think I’ll go upstairs. (Pauses)) I don’t think he’s all right.

Sahaj Yogini: I saw him.

Shri Mataji: Also, I think in Sahaja Yoga if you really seriously work it out everything, you can get rid off anything... guru or anything you can get rid off. If you do not want to work it out and then it’s half way, this way, then of course nobody help you. I think this is the main thing. You have to seriously think about it.

Shri Mataji: Suits you... this colour suits you people. Hmm... That’s nice (Laughter)... I didn’t know where were you. In the car I think... with all of them

Sahaja Yogi: Thank you, Mother.

Sahaja Yogini: It’s so nice.

Shri Mataji: It’s all plastic... so tomorrow we’ll go and buy those jewellery for the ladies and...

Sahaja Yogi: Some cameras... camera...

Shri Mataji: Yeah... Cameras also we’ll see. You didn’t buy any camera.

Sahaja Yogi: I’m not not ...?

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]These people are (UNCLEAR) coming via Singapore or (UNCLEAR)

Sahaja Yogi: (UNCLEAR)

Shri Mataji: How are they coming?

Sahaja Yogi: (UNCLEAR) Sorry Shri Mataji

Shri Mataji: These Sydney people are coming via Singapore?

Sahaja Yogi: I’m not sure yet...we still haven’t finalized their tickets yet. They can come via Singapore

Shri Mataji: They should.

Sahaja Yogi: Because you need to take Visa (UNCLEAR). I’ll call Steven.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Sahaja Yogi: I’ll give a phone call to Steven and find out.

Shri Mataji: Just find out. It’s better if they come and these people can go...they can go by plane and meet them...(Pauses)...It is a big thing this time. 100 people are coming free from the Eastern block. 100 people. [UNCLEAR] Last time also 35 of them. Just ... still I would save money (?) I am sure. But this time, you also have to ... pay their tickets. They were saying, Mother we’ll manage. (Pauses)

We have purchased 2 beautiful ashrams in Rome, very huge...nice with 12 acres of land.

Sahaja Yogi: Outside of Rome or...?

Shri Mataji: That one?

Sahaja Yogi: Outside of Rome?

Shri Mataji: It’s about 1 hour’s drive. Not even that. From the airport it’s about 35 minutes.

Sahaja Yogi: Hmm.

Shri Mataji: Very close...All right. (Shri Mataji does the ‘namaskar’ to the Sahaja Yogis). I’ll just have my [UNCLEAR].
