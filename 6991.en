Public Program Day 2 at Audimax University. Vienna (Austria), 13 October 1987.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

As I told you yesterday that truth is not a concept. When people start establishing something as truth there arises the problem. Because truth can not be organized, can not be ordered, can not be changed, it is what it is. And today the truth is that the time has come for people to get their resurrection. That's the time has come where people have to ascend to their higher being. As in Koran described very clearly as ''Kiyama'' - is the time of resurrection. Said very clearly that your hands will speak. And they will give witness about you. This is the time of Last Judgment. God is not going to weigh people or to judge them. It is you only in your ascent are going to judge yourself. And there are people who are a special category today, who are seeking something higher.

Now yesterday a question was raised about the religion part. All these religions which have come on this earth are product of Divine force. All the prophets and incarnations, all of them came on this earth to propound a special milestone within us. On the Tree of Life all of them grew one after another. But people took out or removed them from the Tree of Life saying, "This is my religion, this is my religion." So believing into something that is dead.

So, what we see today is a mess. And people can't understand how those who profess a particular religion act just the opposite of it. I've seen people who live say in Riyad. They don't drink, they don't look at woman, because they are frightened their eyes will be pierced through, or they will be put in the jail, if they do these things. But when they come to London they drink like nobody's business. They have all kind of relationships, which are very ugly. What happens to them that under fear they work this way and under freedom they behave in a different manner. Same we can say about political theories. I went to Russia and Russian people in Russia are quite all right, under fear. But when they are given freedom - when they are given freedom they behave like anybody else. And also in America if you go the freedom of people is abandonment. You can't walk on the street of New York with your purse in your hand. They are all crazy people there. They are so immature, worse than children even. Sometimes you can't understand them.

About two years back we saw a feature from Hollywood where they showed the very old, above 80, all the actors and actresses coming for a dance. They were very stupidly dresses with all their bones are showing. And they had come for a shake dance. Right from the limousine where they were getting out they were already shaking. So they tried to compete with the young. So there's no maturity in their freedom. It's such an abandonment of all value systems, of all relationships - such impurities. I went there in the year 1973 and told them about this AIDS will be coming very soon to them. And all the homosexuals were so angry with Me, they were about to beat Me. And even today it's a martyrdom there for them to get this disease. Schizophrenic are so common. So what's the use of this freedom? Man has no wisdom to use his freedom. Nor has he any wisdom to use his money. Anybody who gets an extra money he goes to something which is self destructive. The wisdom is so much lacking, there's no discrimination also to decide what is right for you and what is wrong for you. So under these circumstances the religions, so-called also have to take the shapes. They are not religions in any way because there is no enlightenment within. You do not become anything.

In Sahaja Yoga we have Jews, we have Muslims, we have Christians, we have Hindus - people coming from all sides. But they do not fight, they do not quarrel. There is no hankering after positions. Because they can see themselves clearly and they can see others also very clearly. This is wisdom. In the animal kingdom no animal kills another animal, even a tiger doesn't kill another tiger. There are certain qualities of a tiger will remain with the tiger. But human beings are so unpredictable because of their sense of freedom. They could be a scorpion one day, tomorrow a tiger and third a serpent.

What is the reason for this kind of absurd behavior? The reason is that we live with rationality and not with logic. You know even if somebody murders someone there is a rationality behind it. The logic can only come when you have achieved an absolute sense. As you see here the flowers, everybody sees there are flowers here, nobody is going to quarrel whether it is flower or wood. Because they see it, absolutely they know it is flowers, everyone knows they are flowers. In the same way unless and until you have knowledge of propriety of right and wrong how will you say what is right, what is wrong? One goes on compromising with wrong. And thinks they are doing the best things in the world. Everyone thinks they are the chosen ones of God. Jews think they are chosen ones, Muslims think they are chosen ones, the Christians think they are chosen ones. These brands are not going to help anyone. In the Bible in the second verse of second chapter of Matthews, Christ has clearly said, "You'll be calling Me Christ! Christ! I won't recognize you." What is written between the lines is that just by calling yourself that you are a follower of this one and a follower of that and a follower of that, doesn't give you the right to establish yourself as a religious person. A religious person has a religion within himself. Who has no temptations, who has no weaknesses, who doesn't consider money that important. Who is love and compassion and generosity. Who is peace and joy. Such a person has the whole personality which is so auspicious. Auspiciousness is a co-efficience, which emits the rays of Divinity all around. And such a person wherever he goes or wherever he moves, he spreads auspiciousness. Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." How many Christians we'll find who don't have adulterous eyes? It's a very subtle thing Christ has said. The eyes of a religious person has to be innocent, devoid of lust and greed. He doesn't profess any religion whatsoever, but he's religious. And the eyes are so innocent that when such a person even looks at someone, he can bestow benevolence on that person. This should happen, then we can say that there is a person who has religion built in his central nervous system, in his whole being. But everybody can be enlightened. Everybody can get to that state where he can judge on an absolute level.

We live in the world of relativity but then we start living in the world of absolute. Now somebody looks a very good person, he knows how to play flute maybe or he is trying to be very nice and good outwardly. He can make gestures like a saint. How are we to make out? There's a way. When you are enlightened then from your hands the vibrations of Cool Breeze flow. You can feel on these fingertips the centers of another person and if, supposing somebody has cancer, you can feel that person on your fingertips. If you know how just to put the centers all right, you cure the person. So you jump into a new awareness, higher then the human awareness, much higher - of collective consciousness. That you can feel others and you can feel yourself. But there are people who are still very limited and stupid. They identify themselves with some sort of an idea and get stuck with it. But if you are an open minded person I have to tell you the good news - that all such people can become enlightened. You have to have purity of intelligence, is not brilliance that dazzles others or gives big lectures and all that. But pure intelligence means that sees directly the truth. Which is not maligned or spoiled by ideologies and theories. The intelligence which is sold out or is a slave of others' domination cannot be pure intelligence. But today as people are getting disillusioned many honest and sincere people are there seeking the truth. And if you are honest in your seeking you will have to have it. That is your right that you have to get it. Then you'll be surprised that you will transcend all limitations of the world. You won't have all these ideas which make you small. Like a drop becomes the ocean. That's how your personality becomes very great.

I'm very fortunate that I am born at a time when this special work has to be done. It's mentioned in one of our old text that, "At the time when there will be Ghor Kali Yuga, means the worst times in the modern times those people who are seeking the truth, in the jungles and in the Himalayas will find the truth - their Kundalini will be awakened. And today that time has come.

You have been already explained about this, the knowledge of the roots - the Spirit. The Spirit is the truth. Truth is the love, the pure love, the all-pervading Love. And that you know through your central nervous system. Not just by reading something. But as you see the flowers, in the same way you know the truth. The another thing is in the nature of Spirit it is the attention. That means when the Spirit enters into our attention, our attention becomes enlightened. Sitting down here we can find out about anyone in the whole world. As if we enter into the subtler side of ether. And sitting down here we can also correct. This one is just at hand for you - so close to you. The distance is not even three feet. The journey is so small. And it works out.

May God bless you!

So today we'll have some questions, but not from any fanatics please.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, he is asking why are human beings getting ill? And does it have a significance, a meaning why they get ill?

Shri Mataji: Yes. I was about to tell you today but he told Me that he has already talked about it, so I'll just now tell you. But I'll tell you in short. Now here you see - let's push forward everybody cannot see.

What she says?

Yogi: She was asking why the question is not answered, but You just started, Shri Mataji. (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: Now, this is what you are inside, let's see. Now on the left hand side you see a blue line which is - what we call is the moon channel or you can say the left sympathetic nervous system. This channel gives energy to the left sympathetic nervous system. And the another one is the right side one which is yellow colored, goes up there and like a [bile] color it is. It's called as the sunline or ''Surya Nadi'' which gives rise to the right sympathetic system. Now the central one is the one what we call as the ''Sushumna'' is the central path of ascent which is actually - gives, I mean, nourishes the Parasympathetic nervous system. Now, in a human being out of his freedom he can either go to any extreme of left or right. Supposing he is overactive and futuristic, and thinks too much and works too much and physically all the time working out like jogging, this that - all sorts of things. Then he goes to the right side too much. Because he's futuristic, he's speedy, or he may be successful. But he develops a tremendous thing called 'ego'. Ego is there that, "I'm doing this and I'm doing that." Actually we are doing nothing. Whatever is dead we convert it - say the wood is dead, we made the roof, we think we made something great. From dead to another dead. Or from whatever is dead matter we try to discover something out of that and use the energy of that. But we cannot even create one little atom. This is the situation. But we think we are doing this, we are doing that.

As we give stories about some Indian villagers going by plane were told not to take too much luggage, because the plane will feel heavy. So they took all the luggage in the plane, but put it on their heads. (''Laughter'') They were asked, "Why do you do that?" They said, "We are trying to reduce the weight of the plane." In the same way in our ego we think that way. Now this over activity on the right hand side - ego harm others, doesn't harm you. But physically it can give you tremendous effects. First of all as you see it starts with that yellow second center called as Swadhishthana, which is very much responsible for all kinds of physical and mental activities. In that sense that it converts the fat cells of the stomach for the use of the brain, to replace the grey cells when we think too much. So when we think too much this poor chakra cannot look after other functions. Another important work it has got: the liver, the pancreas, the spleen, the kidney and the lower intestines. Large intestine, the descending colon of the large intestines, they say. Now, when these things are neglected the first thing you get is tremendous heat in the body. Tremendous heat, because the liver is overactive. Then this heat passes to higher side and one gets asthma. Because it melts the phlegm. As a result of that you get hay fever, you get sneezing, you get running nose and you get asthma. Of course in the medicine they don't say this. (''Shri Mataji laughing'') They only treat the symptoms. I'm telling you the root cause.

Now, then on the other side is the - you have got the pancreas. The pancreas becomes overactive, so you develop diabetes. You'll be amazed that in India in a village people take so much sugar that they say that the spoon must stand in the sugar. Nobody gets diabetes. But if you think too much all the energy spent in thinking you get diabetes - specially people who sit down and plan, plan, plan. (''Shri Mataji laughing'') Then you have the third problem which is more serious. Is the spleen which is like a speedometer, which keeps the rhythm of life with us. Now, the way our life is, modern life is we invite shocks. Early in the morning we see the newspaper, finished. Horrible news, horrible things, this one fighting, that one killing, that all horrible things. This poor spleen has to produce more red blood corpuscles for emergency. So under shock it start producing more [arbacies ?]. Then you eat your food in a hurry - your breakfast, you push it in your mouth somehow, because all the time is wasted in newspaper reading. So you have no time to have your breakfast. You get into the car and then you find a jam, finished. Then you are breaking your head with worry. Again another shock to poor spleen, it goes on producing [arbacies ?[ without any rhythm in it, it becomes hectic. It is such a hectic life we lead.

Formerly in the times of My father I remember - My father used to get up very early, go for a swim and have his breakfast on the table. And My mother would be fanning him and he would eat with that rhythm. My mother used to give him that rhythm, I used to feel. But nowadays we are so very hectic. Slaves of our watch, every time trying to reach in time. I've known people if you just tell them that, "I have to go to the airport," they go crazy. I have to go not you, but still they are crazy. (''Laughter'') And they'll go on telling, "Now time go." I am going, why are you worried? I'm going, not you are going. (''Laughter'') This kind of behavior spoils the rhythm of our being.

Then is the big problem, the vulnerability is established in the spleen and you get blood cancer. But the cancer is pathological, it comes from the left side. In the sense it is triggered by the left side, by some proteins. But the vulnerability can come from the right side or from the left side.

Now if you go too much to the left also there are problems like that. I must have given at least hundred lectures on this. You can get My tapes and find for yourself. In all details. But in this short time I think I have already told you not to have a futuristic mind. Try to be in the present. Not only it has happening within us in our everyday life, but also in religious life I have seen it happens. When Shri Rama came on this earth they said, "We believe only in ''Parashurama,'' because he is dead now, finished. If he is dead is better to believe in a person who is dead." Then Shri Krishna came. They said, "We don't believe in You, we believe in Shri Rama, because He's dead." They never want to believe in something that is living today, from where you can gain. But they want to believe in something that is dead and finished. Because you can keep such a person in the pocket. Nobody is going to ask you if Christ is not living. He's not going to say, "Why did you do this wrong?" So people don't want to take anything in the present, but present is the truth. The past is finished and the future doesn't exist, so why not get it in the present moment? Because we cannot live in the present moment with the [tempered] life we get into troubles - physical, mental, emotional, material, economic, political, all kinds.

So, how to come to the center? The Kundalini goes through your centers and brings you in one line. She integrates you. But this knowledge is difficult to digest. One of the reasons is I am living. When I will be dead then you might build temples for Me. But just now in your time I'm telling you then you won't accept. You won't try to understand and learn. This is human nature. And this is the reason why all the people who came on this earth could not give Realization to anyone. Even the Christ disciples felt the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost when He was dead. Till the end they were doubting Him. They were doubting His Immaculate Conception.

God is miraculous. You have to see those miracles after Sahaja Yoga. One after another you will be amazed. But one has to rise to that awareness.

Now, one of them I've told you one side, but the another side is people becoming schizophrenic, mad. And all the pathological problems come from the left side.

I think this has taken too much time, this answering. So at length I cannot answer it.

We also have a workshop for you. You are not to give any money to anyone. There's no business going on. You can go and ask them what you want to ask. And they will work on you and explain to you. In such a short time these Austrians have become so knowledgeable. In the same way you all could become very knowledgeable. And all this knowledge is available to you because it is your own. And the new revolution of a very peaceful type within us is working out in the whole humanity today. Which will manifest all over. And as I told you that the One who has created this world will not allow this world to be destroyed.

Now I have to make one humble request is, to take out your shoes to take the help of the Mother Earth for a while. Apart from that shoes are little tight so it's better to. Now put both the feet on the Mother Earth. So the Mother Earth sucks in the left and right side problems within us. Automatically She sucks in when we start feeling the all-pervading Power.

So the first thing that happens to you that when the Kundalini crosses this center you become absolutely peaceful without thoughts. You become thoughtlessly aware. That means at this center the ego and the superego, the conditioning is sucked in. You can think if you want to, but no thoughts can invade you. Then you feel the Cool Breeze emitting out of your own head, which you have to feel yourself. You have to give yourself the certificate. You have to be convinced about yourself. And then you start feeling the Cool Breeze all over in your hands. But sometimes this center if is not all right you may not feel, though you may get your Realization. But you may not feel on your fingertips. If this center is catching the nerves are little dead and then you may not feel. But with little practice you do. Practice means understanding where is the problem is and how to remove the hurdles - you get it.

Now as we are going to use the left hand to express our power of desire like this on your lap. Comfortably you have to sit, but little straight, not like this nor like that, but straight. And if there is anything tight, in the waist or in the neck or anywhere you can little loosen it. In short, you should be comfortable. The right hand should be used for nourishing or helping the Kundalini by putting on different chakras. All of you must do it. It's very simple.

Now I'll show you and then later on we can close the eyes and do the meditation. First we put the right hand on the heart. Where is the reflection of the Spirit. You can put it under the coat, would be better please. Is very good. So many people have heart troubles and things. It's very good thing to put your right hand on your heart. All right. Now, second center we have to attend to is in the upper part of the abdomen on the left hand side. Upper part of the abdomen on the left hand side.

This one gentleman doesn't want to do it - so let him go away. Please. You are already looking not well, why don't you do it?

Yogini: It's his freedom not to do it.

Shri Mataji: Yes, but here others have the freedom that they don't want that you see them. Let them have the freedom. You have to respect their freedom now. No one likes others to watch them. All right. You have to respect their freedom. All right?

Seeker: All right.

Shri Mataji: Thank you! When they close eyes you'll have to close eyes also. We have no right to disturb other people. They have come for their Self Realization and they have their right to have it. And it would be sinful to disturb them. So I would request you not to disturb them.

Now, please put this right hand in the lower part of your abdomen. This is the center of your Divine work. So you have to have in your consciousness the knowledge of the technique. Like when I have to hold something I know what to do - is My consciousness. In the same way you have to have the pure knowledge in your consciousness. And this is the center that works it out. Then you go back on your stomach on the left hand side of the abdomen. This is the center of your mastery. You have to be the master - master of yourself. No slave of any stupidity or of any habits or any kind of temptation. And you have to be the master of the knowledge. So this is a very important center within us.

Now put this hand back on your heart, where resides the Spirit. Now this center is very important about which I was told you have been informed - is the center what we call the left Vishuddhi on the left hand side here, between the neck and the shoulder in this corner, to push the hand that side and turn your head to your right. And push your hand as much as you can on the back side. Now this center is caught up when you have a guilt or you think, "I am guilty." Nobody has to feel guilty at all. Nobody has to feel diffident also. This catch gives you diseases like angina and also spondylitis. So it's better that you put your hands here clearly. Put your head this side when we do meditation later on I will tell you. Now please, you have to put your hand on your forehead. Right hand, right hand. Left hand is towards Me. Right hand. Now press it on both the sides. And press it hard. Now you have to put your hand on the back side of your head and put the load of your head slowly onto it. Lastly you have to stretch your hand. Stretch your hand and you will have to put your center of your hand on top of your head in the fontanel bone area, where it was a soft bone - for your final baptism. This was a soft bone in your childhood and you stretch your fingers up and press the thing down, slowly move your scalp seven times. Clockwise. Slowly. That's all. As simple as that.

I hope all of you will do it and don't watch other people doing it, it's not proper. Now again I request you those who don't want to do it should leave the hall to be civil and kind.

Thank you! Thank you very much! There are nice people. Thank you!

You are not going to leave or you are going to meditate, are you? Now, this gentleman in front. No? Then why are you so adamant? Why don't you leave please.

Yogini: He says he wants to experience something.

'''Shri Mataji:''' Then experience you will have but you must accept what I'm doing. How will you experience without having something? I'm just experience your obstinacy, that's all I am experiencing from you. Then he should go because he cannot have the experience. Then he will say that I must have that experience, how am I going to tell you to raise the Kundalini, how to raise it. You don't want to do it, like I must have the water but I am not take the cup in my hand then what will I do. All right, thank you - let him go. Yes. It's all right, don't get upset, it's all right. You should not be upset at all. Nobody should be upset. Nobody should be upset. It's going to work out.

Now we close our eyes. You may take out your spectacles. Don't watch others. This is the time when we have to look to ourselves, not to others. And please keep your eyes shut because the attention has to go inside. Till I tell you please don't open your eyes. You have to gain something, nothing has to be gained by Me. So be kind to yourself. It's for your benevolence. All right. So if you put your left hand towards Me and both the feet on the ground straight and sit little straight and close your eyes.

First thing we do is to put our right hand on our heart. Here is the Spirit. So you please ask Me a very fundamental question, you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this fundamental question three times.

Aside: Open the door a little bit - too much heat.

Now. Please put your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side please. Now here is a very important center and you have to ask Me a very fundamental question which is followed by the first one. If you are the Spirit you are your master too. So please ask Me a question, "Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times please.

Now please move your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side. Keep the left hand towards Me. This is the center of pure knowledge. But I cannot force on you. In your freedom you have to ask for it. So please ask six times, "Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?" Six times, because this center has got six petals.

By asking this question the Kundalini has started - She is awakened. To help Her cross all the centers properly, you put your right hand on the left hand side of your stomach in the upper part. Here with full confidence please say ten times, "Mother, I am my own master, I am my own guru, I am my guide." Say this ten times.

Now raise your hand on your heart and here we have to see the greatest truth. So now with full confidence in yourself please say, "Mother, I am the Spirit." Please say it twelve times.

Now we have to know that the Divine is the ocean and love, Ocean of Love and Grace. But above all it is the Ocean of Forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you commit it's capable of completely neutralizing it. So have faith in the power of forgiveness of the Divine. So raise your right hand in the corner of your shoulder and your neck and place your right hand, right head towards the right. Now here forgive yourself. And say, "Mother, I am not guilty at all," 16 times. Now if you still feel guilty then better punish yourself by saying 108 times. You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself, because you are entering into the Kingdom of God. So now say 16 times, "I am not at all guilty."

Now raise your right hand to your forehead across. Put your left hand towards Me. Now press on both the sides. On this center you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone." Now some people think it's difficult. But it is a myth whether you forgive or you don't forgive. But if you do not forgive then you play into wrong hands. So from your heart you have to say, not how many times, "I forgive everyone."

Now take your hand on your back side and put your head on that and put the load of your head, slowly. Here for your own satisfaction you have to say, "Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes please forgive me." But only for your satisfaction, not to feel guilty or counting your mistakes.

Now please stretch your right hand, left hand towards Me. And both the feet on the Mother Earth. Now put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area. Now press it hard and you have to move it 7 times slowly clockwise. Here also I cannot force you, so you have to say seven times, "Mother, please give me my Realization." If you like you can bend your head a little, it will make it easier. Now press it hard, stretch your fingers.

(Shri Mataji is blowing into the microphone)

Now take out your hand. Open your eyes slowly. Put both the hands like this. Watch Me without thinking. Now put the left hand, left hand on top of your head. You can bend it if you like and see there is a Cool Breeze coming out. Some people get it very far.

Now put your left hand towards Me. Now put your right hand on top of your head. Some will get it hot, doesn't matter. Now see for yourself if there's a Cool Breeze coming out of your head. Or a hot, could be hot also.

Now please take your left hand on top of your head and put the right hand, try again, try with the left hand.

Good. Now put your hands up like this. And here you have to ask Me a question putting up your head, "Mother, is this Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the ''Brahmashakti''? Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of God's Love?"

Now please put down your hands. Now put your hands like this, don't think. Now those who have got Cool Breeze out of their heads or hot breeze or in their hands, please raise both your hands like this.

Everyone! May God bless you all! So many of you have got it. May God bless you! I bow to all of you.

And there is invitation to you all to take your thrones in the Kingdom of God. And enjoy all the blessings. Very few have not felt, but we have a workshop. Please, please, please all of you should go. Clarify yourself, grow yourself out like a big tree. Respect your Self Realization. You have to grow. That's the important part. Otherwise next year you'll come and tell Me that, "Mother, I've got cancer, I've got this, I've got that." I want you to be the most beautiful people on earth. And I wish you lot of wisdom. And love yourself as I love you all. Now I'll be coming next year again to see you.

May God bless you! Thank you very much!

(Applause)
