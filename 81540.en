To start with, Kay, give me an experience that you can remember from this year that was notable in your heart.

The wallpaper story just triggered a memory for me. We were wallpapering in Shri Mataji's bedroom, and it's a story that shows how she's correcting us all the time. There were three of us wallpapering on the one wall, so it was chaotic. We were crisscrossing each other, and I was getting glue on my head as somebody was up the ladder.

I was looking at their other pieces of wallpaper, and they were kind of skewed, with creases in them. I put my piece up, and when I finished it, I looked back. No creases. It looked absolutely perfect. I was looking down the wall at the others when Shri Mataji swept past and said, "Hmm, upside down."

By the time I realized, it was too late; she was already in another room.
