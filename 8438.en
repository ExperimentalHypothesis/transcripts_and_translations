b'\nUnderstand your importance, Mumbai (India), September 3rd, 1973\n\n[Translation from Hindi]\n\nOut of you many are there who have just got their realization, some are there who have got their realization a few days back and some are there who have got their realization from a long time, who have understood this thing that what is our consciousness and how it works and how we make it our own.\n\nBecause of the three types of people here I will have to repeat again and also explain what is the meaning of realization, what is the speciality of a realized person and how we should stay in a realized state. Whatever you have read before, for now just forget it.\n\nThe first question is: what is the meaning of realization?\n\nWhen you come to My feet many are told that, "You have not got your realization" and many are told that, "You are realized."\n\nThis means that realization has got nothing to do with your outer body, mind, intellect, but it is with something within which connects in some and in others it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\nIn realization, when you come to My feet, the people can feel that the flow starts coming with a force on the hands.\n\nAnd you also feel that something is happening within you even from the feet. In all the directions of you the power of consciousness is playing, inside and outside, like every tree has power of consciousness inside it; its leaves have power of consciousness. And in this way the power of consciousness has its abode in the whole world.\n\nJust like the ether is in all four directions, in the same way this power of consciousness is flowing in all directions. Its abode is inside and outside.\n\nAnd the same power does the work of the material power.\n\nThis power is the Kundalini. It is only a word. Actually God has given no name or meaning to anything, but man has given it the name of Kundalini.\n\nThe power that is called Kundalini is situated at the base of the spine in the sacrum bone.\n\nI am going to write an article explaining the meaning and the scientific explanation about it.\n\nWhen you live as a normal human you live in the body, mind and emotions, and you keep on searching for that thing by which you get joy. When you become one with that power of consciousness by the awakening of the Kundalini, and it comes to the Sahastrara by becoming one with it, then your attention goes on to your Kundalini.\n\nBy going on your Kundalini your attention goes onto the Kundalini of others too.\n\nIt means that till now your attention went to three places and now it goes to a fourth place which is the formless power and by doing that you go beyond thoughts and you start witnessing the mind, emotions and body as a witness.\n\nNow those people from whose hands the vibrations are flowing, they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that \xe2\x80\x9cWe have got these so easily that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a great thing we have got\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nNow the biggest problem is that how did we get such a great thing so easily.\n\nWe must understand that we get the human birth so easily that we cannot understand that how difficult it is to get human birth.\n\nIt is got after many births. And to get reborn again is also after a lot of seeking and many lives.\n\nBut this happens so easily that we are not able to understand its value.\n\nWe also think that how did it happen so quickly.\n\nThe reason is that until now you were seeking outside and it is with you. Like there is a diamond within you and you are searching for it all over the world. Then someone tells you that the diamond is with you and you will say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy was I searching all over the world while the diamond was with me all along?\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThis is an actuality which we have got through Sahaja Yoga.\n\nIn actuality we get it so easily that we cannot understand from where to where we have reached.\n\nOr one can say that in modern times you can go to the moon at once.\n\nIf there is a method that you can go to the moon in a second, then you will feel the same way as to where we have reached, "How can it be?"\n\nIn the same way this happening is so spontaneous that to feel like this is natural. But something that happens spontaneously or happens with a lot of difficulties, then we remember what we got with lot of difficulties. This is the nature of man. And man considers what he earns through his effort as important.\n\nIf one gets lakhs of rupees from his father he will not have value for it. But if with his own effort he earns even two rupees he feels that he has earned through his own effort. This is a sign of his Ego.\n\nBut in Sahaja Yoga when ego gets broken, then to get anything through ego has no significance. The ego is dissatisfied within and thus raises such questions that, "Why is this in sahaja?"\n\nMany of you have seen the methods of realization. In every book you will find new methods, that what such and such happens after realization.\n\nNow from these how many are realized and how many are not? God only knows! But you people who have got your realization know that when you first get realized then your Sahastrara breaks open and you become one with the vibrations.\n\nThen after that he remains here. His sight comes onto his and other\xe2\x80\x99s Kundalini.\n\nBut the vibrations that are coming from within him sometimes stop at once. If he puts his hand on top of head where there is a soft spot is he will see that it calcifies.\n\nNow you got realization yesterday and it calcified. What is the cause of that? The cause is that our ego and super ego get parted and our attention comes into the center but then they grow back again and become one so the calcification takes place and the flow stops. But still you can understand the Kundalini. How?\n\nIf you come back and put your hands towards Me and go into meditation you will be able to see that this hand or thumb has caught because they have their realization. But an unrealized person when he sits with his hands towards Me he will not feel anything.\n\nThey will feel that this finger of mine is caught. It is coming in this one and not in the other. And from those who are knowledgeable will understand which is the finger associated with which Chakra.\n\nThis cannot be known through mental calculations. I did not tell you. Because if I told you people will say that Mataji is just talking uselessly.\n\nSo I felt better see for yourself.\n\nThen when he put his hands towards the other, his finger started burning. So then I said that, "Keep your hand on his Nabhi chakra and see. Close your eyes and see what chakra is moving. You will see that your Nabhi is moving. So when you put your hands towards him you saw that the finger associated with the Nabhi chakra was burning."\n\nAnd all will feel the same finger on themselves when they put their hands towards that man. You can write any books about it but the way it works, it works like that only.\n\nJust yesterday a person was arguing with Me about Gyaneshwari. If Gyaneshwar was here we could ask him today. He too was trying to find a way on how to explain it. But he could not do it as he died at a very young age.\n\nBecause of many people dying before their time a lot of misunderstanding has spread in the world.\n\nAnd then the second mistake they did is that they wrote a book about this. That is why I am afraid of writing books.\n\nBecause the moment I write a book people will start learning by heart and with that also a conditioning comes in.\n\nSo now instead of thinking what is in it and what happens you must think that this is a new experience, a new thing, we are new people and we have to understand something new. We are going to sit here as new.\n\nLike a small child from childhood listens to every new word and then learns by repeating many times. So in the same way you all who have come into this new Divine Region, must understand this divinity.\n\nIts sight (way of seeing) should be different.\n\nWhen I used to read this name \xe2\x80\x98Divyalok\xe2\x80\x99(Divine Region), I used to think that the person who kept this name must have kept it after a lot of thinking. What a beautiful name\xe2\x80\xa6 Divyalok. The Divine Region that you have come into, you must understand that this is all new for you. All the experience in it is new. It is not something written somewhere and experienced by others. It is what we have to experience.\n\nNo one has experienced something like this before. And nowhere in the world has this experiment been successful anywhere before this because I too have come on this earth many times before. I have thought of doing this many times before and this is the first time in this lifetime that this work has been successful.\n\nThat is why whatever unfinished that is left you have to complete it. You have not come to belittle or pull down anyone. Whatever incompleteness has been left, you have to complete it. Just think that you are new persons in this modern world with an expanded vision, and you have to guide the whole world.\n\nIn this, all realized people are sitting under one roof and getting this Supreme Shakti. A very great power is flowing from within you, which is not there in other people in this world. You know this.\n\nYou should have no doubt on that because now you are realized. Those who still doubt is because they have just got their realization. In a few days they too will not have doubts.\n\nThen it becomes necessary that you understand your importance.\n\nThe greatest importance is that you have now got the fourth dimension.\n\nWhich fourth dimension? That how you can go from this to that.\n\nPlease understand this. Now from this how you can go to the other, stay there, stay steady there. This is a very important point. If you look at your attention, you will see that there is a kind of an expansion.\n\nLook at your attention and you will see how it goes to something and how you are able to remove it. It is expanding and you can see it. Just like a balloon, which will expand like this. In the same way you watch your attention.\n\nYour attention can go to something and even come back. See how our attention has gone onto something. For example, your attention is on a sari. Now when it is on a sari you can pull it back from there. You can take your attention and expand it or contract it. And you can take it wherever you want.\n\nBut you are completely spread out within it. Like the sea. In the sea the water goes to every corner and goes back. But its reality is in the center of the ocean. The reality, the is-ness that which happens, is within. And the reaction of that is consciousness. It goes to anything and then comes back again. With this you learn detachment. Just become detached from anything.\n\nNow, for example that vehicle came. There is a very bad smell coming from it. If you take your attention to the bad smell then it smells bad.\n\nIf you take your attention away then the bad smell is not coming. You have got the power of Detachment come within you. Slowly, keep practicing on your attention.\n\nMan is sitting in the midst of the entire drama. He sees, "What is this? What is this? What is this? This is also, this is also."\n\nPeople say that this is all theirs.\n\nPut your attention to it. As you put your attention to it you will know, you will know that you can also remove your attention from it. Your attention does not involve with anything. And whatever love you send towards it [with your attention] will just go around it and will come back to you but [thanks to your attention] will not get lost.\n\nUnderstand this. Before when you used to observe something with thoughts, like if something moves from here, it will keep moving and its circumference will be kept. So [now]it will circle and then come back to you. It will not catch. It will not catch hold of it. Attachment will also finish off in this way. Every attachment of mind, body and intellect gets released but also of all the other things within us.\n\nThis truth that we are humans first and last also gets released because we have broken our attachment. The way to break the attachment in meditation is to always increase your attention.\n\nSee? Now it has increased, it has gone to a point and now bring it back. This special power has come to you after realization.\n\nUntil now I had told you many things and besides that also, pay attention to this.\n\nIn deeper meditation what you have to do is the expansion of your attention and its pulling back. When you will start doing contraction and expansion, you will be surprised that your depth will grow.\n\nFor example, if a person who spread a lot of wheat his spread is more. Then you gathered the wheat and made a pile, then its height grew.\n\nIn the same way if you gathered your attention then see, your inner depth grew and knowledge came in. Then you started to laugh that \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I was wrapped up in all this? Is this anything to cling on to?\xe2\x80\x9d You will feel that this is not anything great.\n\nThere is a boy from here who got realization, went for an interview for a job.\n\nWhen he came back I asked him whether he got it. He said that he did not feel whether he got it or not and will get it or not.\n\nHe got selected for the job. The people on the board told Me that this boy was amazing and was not scared. He came, said very clearly what he had to say, was not frightened and went. How did this happen?\n\nI had told them that he is now realized soul and, "Watch him and examine his uniqueness."\n\nThey said he came and gave straight answers, there was no deception, he spoke clearly, and stood in a way that, "If you want to take me or not that\xe2\x80\x99s fine." Neither did he insult us nor hang behind us wagging his tail.\n\nAttention is also like this. When the attention has nature, then divinity comes into man when he gets realization.\n\nWhen his attention is entangled in every place, then his attention becomes just like tendrils come out specially the climbing ivy. They come out and catch this, then catch the other, and then she slowly climbs upwards.\n\nIn the same way a man who has not got realization catches onto this, onto that, then another, and that is how he sustains himself this manner. Sometimes he thinks: \xe2\x80\x9cI have no position, how will I move in the world? Oh! I have no money, how will I move in the world? Oh! I do not have this, how will I move in the world?\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nBut a tree which stands on itself stands in its own independence. Now this is happening with you too. You are standing in your independence but because of fear you are taking out tendrils from within yourself and catching this, then that, then another.\n\nAs soon as you know you are standing there, first thing is not to oppose the attention. It should not be stopped.\n\nThat attention will not be entangled anywhere, you try, but it will not get entangled.\n\nTry this in deep meditation.\n\nAny big question comes before you, just look at it, and you will be surprised that the attention goes there and comes back.\n\nThe attention does not get entangled.\n\nNow think that a very great tragedy has taken place here but the world is going on.\n\nPain and Pleasure is our mental calculations: what is the great thing that makes us unhappy or makes us very happy, or what is it that is painful or joy-giving that we hate someone or love someone? There is no great reason that this should be. Slowly your attention will grow tremendously. Then the attention becomes absolutely proficient.\n\nYou have seen that your hands start burning, you work on someone and something happens to you. In the beginning this will happen. And should keep away from such a person. Wherever possible don\xe2\x80\x99t put your hand in fire. When a girl learns to cook she learns first on a small stove. She puts a cloth to lift hot things and learns slowly.\n\nOnce her hand has learnt how to burn then she works on a bigger stove.\n\nFirst she takes a tongs then a tava [on which Indian chapattis are made], and then when she becomes an expert she makes rotis with her hands. She can put her hands on a stove directly and flip the rotis.\n\nIn the same way what we in the beginning call evil also goes away. So that which is called evil will run away by itself. It will have no effect on you. When this state comes then what is the need for Mother\xe2\x80\x99s protection.\n\nYou yourself will become great. Then you will not catch or anything.\n\nWherever you go there negative people will run away. When such a capability comes then such a question does not arise.\n\nLike I have said that there\'re only two ways for this: one is meditation from within and to watch the outside.\n\nNow it is working out by itself. They say that first \'do\' good karmas. \'Good\' or \'bad\' is also the thinking of humans.\n\nWhen Doing becomes Non-doing it means, that we no more feel that we are doing anything, like the light of the sun, it is in non-doing though work is being done through him.\n\nWhen the non-doing comes into one fully, which means that the cool breeze is flowing through the hands and is happening, then whatever is within, then whatever karmas that are gathered within us from before, which we say that we will have to bear the results of our karmas.\n\nLots of sick people come and ask Me that: \xe2\x80\x9cThese are our karmas, will you suck them in?\xe2\x80\x9d. I say: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will. Nothing to worry about\xe2\x80\x9d. You have come to the river Ganga so you should wash yourself. If because of your karmas your hands and feet pain, then doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, I can absorb it all.\n\nBut your karmas went up from your body into your mind. Now how will the karmas be removed from your mind?\n\nThey ran away from your body due to Mataji. But the karmas are sitting in the mind. You have got your realization, but still, will this filth get removed?\n\nThat is why if you keep doing these actions (of Sahaja Yoga) again and again, then all this gets drowned in akarma (non-action). And however much you do in this life, that much your karmas will finish off.\n\nSlowly as you do your karmas, and so slowly get out, and when you are completely cleared out from within, then from within that same good faith then this like, dislike etc., nothing remains.\n\nIf you are sitting, you are just sitting. If you get food to eat then fine, or don\xe2\x80\x99t get to eat that is fine too.\n\nWhatever you do, you are doing the work of the Divine. You are not doing anything of your own work. The work of the Divine is being done through you and you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know like the sun which is giving its light. The moon is reflecting the light of the sun from itself. This is the ocean is rising and ebbing and sending clouds from within itself.\n\nAll these karmas are being done. But no one thinks that we are doing. There are trees and from them come the fruits and from the fruits come the seeds and then from the seeds the trees. They are doing such a great work. But none of themfeels that we are doing something. Everything is moving leisurely. This question has come only into humans.\n\nThey all are in harmony. But we have this question because in humans God has specially given the boon of Ego by which we can know Him.\n\nWe have seen that by killing Ego it does not die. That is why if it gets released by itself, then this is the way of Sahaja Yoga.\n\nIt gets released from within you. What one has todo that whatever karma we can do with our hands we should do. And the other is going into deep meditation, till that state does come within you where nothing is \'bad\' or \'good\'.\n\nYou have seen that wherever I go neither any negativity catches Me nor bhoots catch Me or nor My finger catches nor My hands catch.\n\nAt each time the flow is the same. If you people feel any heat from Me, then it means that there is some fault within you. This is an example in front of you. I am also like you but I am an example in front of you.\n\nSo in the same way you become like this then no devil or evil will remain.\n\nWhosoever will come in front of you should dissolve in your love. And if he does not dissolve then he will run away. A day will come and that day you will not need this protection.\n\nYou people have found many ways of protection. These people can tell you about some of the ways if you want. You can ask them. Like taking vibrations on the photo. Taking out (vibrations) with feet or taking out with water. How to put your own bandhan etc. Taking different names, etc. There are many types. If you want to know about them then you can talk to these people, then these people can tell you all this.\n\nBut a realized person when he sits for meditation firstly must see that what is coming from Mataji is there any of our catch in it? Are we getting vibrations? If they have stopped then we should remove the cause.\n\nThese people can tell you how to remove it.\n\nIn the same way the vibrations have stopped then the cause of it can be removed.\n\nIf the hand is burning then how to remove it? Just blow on it, and remove it, and take the name, and it will just get removed by blowing it away. It will get removed in such a way that you will feel that it was never there. It is in the atmosphere so one catches. Just like a small girl learns how to cook.\n\nAnd when you become learned in this method then only have you become a real Yogi. When this ability has come fully, then you become a real yogi. You get the perfect knowledge. When you get the perfect knowledge about this then you become the knowledge.\n\nMeans that you don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything, it keeps happening automatically.\n\nIf microphone becomes perfect and My voice is going through it perfectly then it does not have to do anything, it does not need to know anything. All this records by itself. So the Speaker, the Doer and the One who looks after everyone, is the Divine who is on the head of everyone.\n\nRealized people should know one more thing. This is also a very important point, by knowing which a kind of self-reliance can come, that the Devatas are hovering over each realized soul.\n\nThey say that on top of an evil person the bhoots hover, in the same way the Devatas are eager to help those people who are realized. They get the fragrance and they hover precisely around them.\n\nFrom among you some must have told, this lady was telling that there was a bhoot, badha on her brother-in-law. and at about three thirty his condition deteriorated. And he started screaming. And then after that she said that such a bad smell came and they could not understand what to do. Then they started taking My name and started giving vibrations and just as he cooled down a fragrance started coming and he became alright.\n\nYou people should also before getting realization or after realization get fragrance many times. So consciousness gives fragrance.\n\nChaitanya gives a lot of fragrance. And is Joy giving. So with this you get fragrance. There is so much that is non-fragrant, but it can fall by itself if you keep your meditative state alright, means that you keep yourself steady.\n\nThere is nothing to feel bad about it.\n\nYou have seen that we are unique. We are higher than the common man. So-and-so [Uncertain. Names may be: Chandu Bhai, Devade, Lal Sahib \xe2\x80\x93 ed.] is very great.\n\nMany have gone much above.\n\nIf you take their names then I think mostly all have gone ahead. And still all catch a bit. All catch a little bit.\n\nOne person had got caught up very badly.\n\nA few days before he had got caught up very badly. It\xe2\x80\x99s ok if he got caught up. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. At least they understand that they are caught up and that is why this has happened, that he understood that he got caught up.\n\nTo remove it is very easy. For a realized person it is very easy. It should be removed in any way. How to remove it, what to do about it, are the methods these people know.\n\nAnd experiment on yourself with different methods. Like it can be removed by standing near the sea.\n\nEarlier many realized people used to go and sit in water. It is true.\n\nThey used to get so disturbed that their fingers would start burning.\n\nThere is a Gagan Baba Maharaj who used to sit in water. His fingers had got small with burning. He had got curative powers but he could not understand why his fingers had become small with burning. His fingers got so small by burning; like you know how your fingers burn.\n\nBut poor thing he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that.\n\nNow he does not come to Bombay city because in Bombay the hands burn so much and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to make it alright so he has gone away from here. And he keeps sitting in water. Now there is someone who knows and can tell you. There is someone who can explain that if your hands are burning how to cure it. Save your hands.\n\nOur Mr Devade\xe2\x80\x99s hands got burned very badly by working on 2-3 people, that now if he looks at someone he gets nervous.\n\nHe says, \xe2\x80\x9cMataji, yesterday when that bearded man came his hands started rotating in the air."\n\nSo now think that there is someone who can tell you, make you understand that after realization it is such a dangerous thing. Anyone can catch you. You are just like small children. And such a small child that it is very necessary that you should look after your state. My hand is on you all, all the time. And each moment I am thinking of you.\n\nI have a lot of Love for you all and I feel very proud and also get joy that so many are My children today.\n\nIt is a feeling of great pride for a Mother that they have got realization.\n\nBut what you have got, don\xe2\x80\x99t waste it on petty things.\n\nJust now Mr. Jadhav had experience and was telling Me, even Mr Patil and ladies can tell about it. How they got experiences and how they can make someone alright.\n\nMeans that whatever problem there is you can solve it. But you too should also learn. You too learn. You too get to know. You are the doctor and you are the medicine.\n\nIt is going to go through your hands and you are going to understand it. So if you got a little hurt somewhere Mother is sitting here to heal you.\n\nWhere were such people before? Because now, poor things, the ones who have got their realization say that: \xe2\x80\x9cO God save us, from where have we got our realization\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nEarlier when people got their realization they would sit with tongs in their hands (to save themselves from negativity).\n\nIt was not their fault.\n\nAnybody who came they would beat them. If anyone came who would radiate heat or cause burning sensation, they used to beat them with tongs. I have seen them in My childhood.\n\nThey used to be called \'the Baba with the tongs\'!\n\nI used to be surprised that whoever came he would hit with a pair of tongs. But I have never hit with Tongs. Then who would go to them? The reason for this is that there was no one to explain to them or guide them.\n\nNow you people are curing so many diseases. You have cured diseases like cancer. You are able to cure cancer. You have removed so many types of badhas. You have done so much work. Naturally then something or the other will catch you. But then there is a cure for it. There is a hospital for you and there is someone sitting here to guide you. And there is someone to explain the intricacies of it. So there is no need to get frightened. But if you are still scared then you cannot progress in this lifetime. This is the question of realized people.\n\nBut we should understand another thing.\n\nThere are many Saints who are have died but they are not able to take their birth. They have not been able to find such a person.\n\nThat is another question. Such Saints are also reaching a viewpoint that among us there are people who can never be realized.\n\nThere are many among us who will never get realization because they have done such karmas before.\n\nSome have done planchette [calling spirits] where they have got stuck or some such similar thing. Where they say that we should come into them. You will find badhas in them. But they are stuck and there is no need to fight with them.\n\nIn fact the very clerical people among you will feel that Mataji is saying such things.\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t provoke them because if you provoke them then it can happen that the bhoots can go into them. Bhoots are already within them. If there will be no bhoots then the saints will come. When the saints come, then our work will be done. That is why in many people the saints have [come in/entered?]. They have expressed this to Me that they want to come.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if we come in the form of little children then what kind of help Shri Mataji can get?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo it is better that such people who come and one can see that they can\xe2\x80\x99t get realization. There are many people like that.\n\nThe ones who are not getting their realization there is no need to fight them, but such people will keep coming. They will come for 4 years or perhaps 10 years but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\n\nMeet them. They are coming and you know they have not got their realization. The ones who have got their realization will remain realized, but the one who has not got realization and they are going in and out, there is no need to get involved with them.\n\nThis I need to tell you today.\n\nOn them is the influence of the saints because they can\xe2\x80\x99t do without it also. To drive away the bhoots and badhas only the saintly people will work. Because you people can\xe2\x80\x99t see and you cannot go to those worlds. So let them do this work.\n\nThese people come and say that they will keep working and will help you in your work.\n\nThey will not cure you or anything but they will do such a work that they will work with others. They will drag people to come (in Sahaja Yoga) and bring many more people who want to come.\n\nThere was such a person who had even written an article on Me. But someone scared him so he ran away. He was never going to get realization. There was someone else who rose against Me. Then, after that, poor thing got stuck into his vortex, then another thing started and he got stuck with it. So you should save such people.\n\nKeep them in the company of saints and at least they will remain in morality and no bhoots and badhas will come to them and if they have no bodily or mental sufferings and their brains will remain alright, because the saints do not trouble anyone, that is why the saints should come into them.\n\nBut even the great souls are also hovering over you. They are also helping you. They too are helping and will help you with many things: your body, mental, emotional will remain balanced and will see to your worldly affairs: they will look after your house: they will look after your children. This is what these people hovering over you will do.\n\nBut you should completely [be] one with God.This is a great responsibility on you.\n\nToday I wanted that if any one has any questions then they want to discuss then please do so. Mr Shroff had \xe2\x80\xa6.\n\nYou have to be like a gardener in a garden. You have to see how to maintain this garden, how to plant it, how to move it, you will have to think it all out. You think about it and tell how it can be done. One thing he said is right. He was saying that if we give realization and we don\xe2\x80\x99t follow up with it, then the realization gets lost.\n\nIf we, after giving it we don\xe2\x80\x99t follow up and protect them we don\xe2\x80\x99t look after them, take them forward and it can be that their realization can be lost. And then it will again awaken and till then they will be in difficulties.\n\nAnd all should meet at least once a month. Each and every realized person should meet once a month.\n\nMake it such a way that every month a letter should go to each one. Or make a newspaper where you can distribute it and no money should be taken. Do not give money anywhere or borrow money from anyone. Do not get involved with money. Even the land the government gives for ashram never think that you will plant vegetables, then you are selling vegetables. There is no need to get into such enterprises. We are not to earn money.\n\nYou must have read what happened to the Chairman of the State Bank. He went to the ashram and gave 90 lakhs there, 20 lakhs were given elsewhere for making furniture.\n\nWhat a senseless thing to make furniture in an ashram. Please do not make furniture and then sell it, otherwise tomorrow we will see that, "These people are making furniture." There is no need for that. It is forbidden for you to do gardening. For this there are many people.\n\nYou are here for a special work. You have to help in meditation, vibrations, and alleviating the suffering, and take time out to give them realization and giving vibrations. And where it concerns money just keep far away. And take so much money, keep its accounts, there is no need for it. If you get involved with money and its accounts, you will get caught up always.\n\nMoney and God have no connection. If someone gives you a place for free, then it\xe2\x80\x99s fine, and someone who does not give it for free, then that fine too. It is all God\xe2\x80\x99s work.\n\nIf someone gave you a place to sit, then he was God\xe2\x80\x99s man who gave it, and if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a place to sit, then it does not matter.\n\nNo one becomes God with a position.\n\nThere are many ashrams. Don\xe2\x80\x99t put your attention there. That we are going to do this or that, or do business in an ashram, I will never let such a thing happen.\n\nAnd when I see that you are stuck in some business then it is not My responsibility.\n\nYou have to do no business whatsoever.\n\nYou have not to collect money in any way, for nothing at all. One person said to Me that he will sell My photos and then that money he will give to the ashram.\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich ashram? What money? Who said so? Why do you listen to others?\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThere is no need to worry for all this. The One who is doing and looking after us is Him. We are not doing our work. We are doing His work. If He wants, He will give, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to, He won\xe2\x80\x99t give.\n\nAnd the same work we do night and day of eating \xe2\x80\x98filth\xe2\x80\x99, and if we are going to come here and do it, then it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use. Don\xe2\x80\x99t give Me ideas like this, because two or three have given and I am very pained.\n\nPlease do not give these kinds of suggestions. That way I am very straight and innocent but this way I am very clever.\n\nI am not going to come into these tricks.\n\nI am telling you this beforehand, that if you try to trick Me into money matters, I am not going to get conned into it, whether you get realization or not. It does not concern Me at all. You must realize that there is no connection between money and realization anywhere.\n\nThe other thing is that there is no connection of politics with this. There will such people who will come to you who will say to you to stand for elections as you have such a large following.\n\nIf you want to go into politics then you do that, but politics has been created by humans and not God. The one who stands with the Divine has nothing to do with politics and government. You must understand this first.\n\nAnd there is no connection with your position. If you think that you are a very big trustee, or someone who thinks I am a very big secretary or a big chairman - \xe2\x80\x9cI am a Chairman\xe2\x80\x9d - then there is no connection with any \xe2\x80\x98chair\xe2\x80\x99. And neither is there any throne or seat.\n\nRemember this first of all.\n\nAnd nothing to talk about it. It has neither seat nor throne. There is no seat.\n\nUnderstand? There is no need to make a special seat (in the future).\n\nWho is sitting on Adi Shankaracharya\xe2\x80\x99s seat now, someone who is non-realized, so nothing doing. Nobody is going to sit on any seat. All are sitting on their own seats.\n\nWhen we sit on someone\xe2\x80\x99s seat we are afraid of losing that seat (position).\n\nBy sitting on your own seats and ruling over your own selves from your own seat, then a lot will be done. Just tie a knot of these things I have said and remember them.\n\nThird thing that, a good character, good conduct and purity, without this you cannot rise. If you have some bad habits you will have to make an effort to leave, take this vow on My feet.\n\nActually it is this, that now you have shakti within you. Indians have a very bad habit of criticizing others. We are now connected with love. We are all brothers and sisters. If something has happened amongst each other, can be that someone\xe2\x80\x99s foot slips, then it is not necessary that you go and discredit him all over the world.\n\nBut you should put in all efforts in if necessary for saving your brothers by giving up your life for your brothers and sisters. For that whatever you have to do, we will have to save him.\n\nIt is moral responsibility. It does not mean you have to pay money for that.\n\nDo not lend any money to anyone. If someone asks for money don\xe2\x80\x99t give a penny.\n\nThere is no need to lend money to anyone.\n\nIf some person, in his spiritual life, where his Kundalini is being destroyed or falling down then help him. If someone has got into some bad habits then all of you should make a chakra with one\xe2\x80\x99s love to help out.\n\nTill the Purity does not come into us fully, our work will be left incomplete.\n\nYou should know this that the eyes of the whole worldare on you.\n\nBy lighting diyas celebrate Diwali with this. People do not have their sight on a house, but on the lamps that burn.\n\nThe people\xe2\x80\x99s attention is on you, in sense they are watching that those who have got realization and are curing many sicknesses in the world, how are they leading their own life.\n\nSometimes you criticize this one, criticize that one. Though I have not seen such criticism. At this moment such negativity has not come. But it can be.\n\nIf there is anything, just come and tell Me.\n\nNo one has perfect as yet. So come and tell Me. I will cure that problem. And whatever failings (problems) you have, never feel shy talking with your brothers and sisters. If you say that, "This is catching in me", then it can be cleared. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell them how can it be cleared.\n\nThere is no need to feel bad as you know that all catch, and all are doctors and doctors give free treatment among themselves.\n\nSo all of you can get cured among yourselves. You must have brotherhood among yourself, and keep your attention on an extremely pure life.\n\nSo purity is very necessary. Without that nothing can be done.\n\nIf I had spoken about purity before, then it would be a question of perversion, that you clear out on one and catch another. You clear out on the third thing and you catch a third thing.\n\nBut after realization this problem does not remain.\n\nAfter realization, a hole (Sahastrara) has been made on top of the head from where everything will go out from here. You leave one thing and it will go out from top of the head. It will go out fully.\n\nIt will not enter anywhere else. That is the advantage of the hole that has been made here. If you have some habits you have in keep it in your mind and then take it out from here. Wherever the habit is there, you feel heavy.\n\nOn the Nabhi some like to eat a lot. It does not look nice overeating. So pay attention to your Nabhi.\n\nFrom Nabhi then slowly remove it. Then everything will come out from here, all the filth. Look at him. This gentleman told Me that I can now take breath from here (top of head).\n\nThis is good.\n\nWatching your breath, watching, hearing, moving are all from here (Sahastrara).\n\nEverything happens due to consciousness, and when consciousness has come on top of the head, then it will happen up here. The beating of the heart, the work of the whole body is done from here.\n\nSo anything that you want to take out from within yourself, then just press it and take it out from here. It will release by itself. It will all be released from here. Because there is now a hole, it is of great help. The hole was not there so\xe2\x80\xa6 Like they say that if you press the ocean on one side, it grows on the other. But if a hole be made in it then it will flow out. So, if you press it on aside, it will not go to the other side.\n\nMake an effort and look towards yourself as to what is impure within us. Like our Mother\xe2\x80\x99s name is Nirmala, so too we have to be Nirmal (Pure). And what is impure within us, and not within others. I was watching that some were looking at others. No, no, I mean what is within us. Which Ham [Spirit] is it? What is it that is within us? These are our misidentifications, means that we have thought of ourselves as Christians, we are Muslims, we are Hindus and the rest are useless.\n\nThis is a misidentification, \xe2\x80\x9cWe Indians are the best, and the rest are useless\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThese all are misidentifications and all are false. There is just one truth that we are humans.\n\nThat is the reality. First thing is, if you know this answer, then you will understand the rest that you are. One must keep watching all your misidentifications at each moment.\n\nWhat are we thinking at this moment?\n\nWe are thinking that I have to go home and make food. Some are thinking that tomorrow is office. What will happen in office tomorrow?\n\nPeople are thinking various things, and I know what all they are thinking.\n\nYou should listen to My lecture in Thoughtlessness. The One who cooks for us is sitting here. We do not make the food.\n\nThink about this once that such a miracle has happened, that just sitting here you have become thoughtless.\n\nBecause matter is also made from that Conscious Power. See this. The Cook is sitting. Such questions will get answered. As soon as you go into Thoughtless awareness you will understand that you have come under the protection of God, and in thoughtless awareness His light has come into you.\n\nIf you have any questions please ask Me now as a lot of time has gone for meditation. Next time we will have meditation. And at this moment let us have a puja by which you will be specially given a Protection by which no problem comes to you.\n\nThere are many devils roaming around outside and you can get into trouble.\n\nAfter this the program is in Pune. Those who want to come to Pune they can come, but try to attend this two -week program.\n\nNow, what I have said, just think about it.\n\nNow with My lecture you will not get conditioned. Your conditionings will also fall away.\n\nThe greatest benefit of realization is that nothing will now stick to you.\n\nIts gross will not stick to you, only its conscious may stick.\n\nEven if I speak in Urdu, Farsi or French, but the conscious Power that is flowing through the words that will come into you. So with this the vibrations will flow into you, even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the language.\n\nThe love that is flowing from within is what is touching you. Like you may not know the name, but the fragrance is flowing into you.\n\nThe fragrance is the Consciousness and the flower is the name. So, even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the name, the fragrance comes through. Each human can smell it and he can tell even if he is English, French or Indian. There is no need to speak about it.\n\nSo, in the same way, God\xe2\x80\x99s fragrance which is the consciousness Power, can flow into anyone, whatever may be his language, "It is a different what I wanted to say, and what I wanted to give is different, that has got established inside."\n\nAnd any problems that were inside will be taken out from here [Sahastrara]. A churning goes on inside, and whichever thing the chakra is blocked take it out and get rid of it, throw out it.\n\nSome may get a heavy head, If you are catching from someone, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry even your heaviness will also go out with it.\n\nLike I said yesterday that take out with the left hand.\n\nIf anyone wants to ask questions please do.\n'
