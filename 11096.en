INCARNATIONS

Different stages of human evolution took place when all these incarnations came on this earth.

Incarnations have to come. If you reason it out you will understand why an incarnation is needed to come on this earth. The unconscious can guide you through symbols which appear in your dreams. There are so many other ways by certain happenings the unconscious, the Divine can guide you; but It is all vague, extremely vague. The conscious must have a mouth to explain itself. It must have proper body to be able to communicate what it has to say otherwise

how are you going to have a rapport with unconscious.

You cannot have any rapport with the divine unless and until you know you are Atman, your Atma. Before that whatever you may try may create a depth in you, a cerenity in you, a character in you but still you cannot have a direct rapport.

You are to be connected. Now somebody has to do this job. That is why many incarnations came on this earth.
