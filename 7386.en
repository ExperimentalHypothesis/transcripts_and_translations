Public Talk (in Marathi). Dr Antonio De Silva High School. Dadar, Bombay (India), 26th Nov 1984.

I bow to all of you who are the seekers of truth. TODAY’S SUBJECT IS “PRAPANCHA” AND ‘SAHAJ YOGA’. FIRST OF ALL LET US SEE WHAT IS THE MEANING OF WORD “PRAPANCHA”. ‘PRAPANCHA’ , “PANCHA” MEANS ‘FIVE’(CINCI), THE FIVE ELEMENTS THROUGH WHICH OUR EVOLUTION TOOK PLACE. BUT “ PRA ” WORD IN FRONT OF IT CHANGES ITS MEANING. IT MEANS THE LIGHT OF FIVE ELEMENTS “ PRAPANCHA”.( PRAPANCHA ALSO MEANS MARRIED FAMILY LIFE) “ Avghachi Sansar Sukhachakrin” ( I shall make the whole world joyous) this joy we should get in Prapancha. You cannot find God except Prapancha. MANY PEOPLE IMAGINE THAT “YOGA” MEANS TO GO TO HIMALAYAS AND SIT THERE TO DIE OF FREEZING COLD. IT IS NOT YOGA. IT IS ‘HATHA’( OBSTINACY/ INCAPATINARE). IT IS NOT EVEN OBSTINACY BUT LITTLE STUPIDITY. This imagination about Yoga is absolutely wrong. Specially in Maharashtra all the saints were married. They practiced Prapancha. Only Swami Ramadasa did not do Prapancha. But in “Dasa Bodha”( Marathi scripture by Saint Ramadasa) ..Prapancha is flowing in every page. Leaving Prapancha , you cannot find God. He said this many times. To find God by leaving Prapancha has been the imagination of people of our country since ancient times. This is the reason why Buddha left Prapancha and went to Jungles and got self realization there.. But even if he would have lived with family, he would have got self realization. For example; if we have to go to Dadar ( place in Bombay), we can reach by staright way there. But instead we go to Bhiwandi then Pune and after roaming in four-five places then we reach Dadar. One is straight path and other is zig-zag. The zig-zag way is correct, it is not so. That time there was no easy way so they chose the difficult path. They made the easy path very difficult. 

So, shall we also make the same difficult path for us? Therefore everyone has described about the easy and straight path. ‘Sahaj’. We should go in Sahaj Samadhi. All the saints said “ Sahaj Samadhi Lago” ( go into sahaj meditation). KABIRA GOT MARRIED. GURU NANAKA WAS ALSO MARRIED. FROM THE TIME OF KING JANAKA ALL WHO HAVE BECOME GREAT REALIZED SOULS GOT MARRIED. AFTER THEM MANY CAME WHO DID NOT GET MARRIED BUT NEVER CRITICIZED THE MARRIAGE ORGANIZATION. And it is not that what we call as Prapancha is wrong. 

So, first of all we should remove this imagination from our minds that if we have to go through path of Yoga then we have to leave Prapancha. Instead,if you are in Prapancha then you must come to Sahaj yoga. In the beginning when I started Sahaj Yoga in Dadar , everyone used to come with the complaints of Prapancha. “My mother in law is not alright, My husband is not alright, my wife is bad, my children are not alright etc ..all these small complaints of Prapancha people used to bring in Sahaj Yoga. It happens only in the beginning. We come to God with the problems of Prapancha by getting upset of them and for solving the problems of Prapancha. And we ask God, “ Oh ! God My house should be alright, my children should be healthy my married life should flourish , everyone should be happy in my family” that’s all. HUMAN INCLINATION IS LIMITED AND SO MUNDANE, AND HE LOOKS EVERYTHING FROM THAT MUNDANE LEVEL. BUT THIS MUNDANE LEVEL IS REQUIRED. IF IT IS NOT THERE THEN THINGS WONT WORK FINE AHEAD. ONE CANNOT COME ON SECOND STEP BEFORE CROSSING FIRST STEP. SO PRAPANCHA IS THE FIRST STEP AND VERY IMPORTANT IN SAHAJ YOGA. I CANNOT GIVE REALIZATION TO A “SANYASI” ( ASCETIC). I CANNOT ! WHAT TO DO? I TRIED MANY TIMES BUT IT DOESN’T WORK OUT. THE REASON IS THAT WE WEAR THE EXTERNAL CLOTHES OF ASCETIC…BUT ARE YOU AN ASCETIC FROM INSIDE? ASCETICISM IS THE FEELING INSIDE. You cannot become a saint by wearing just the clothes, that we are saints, I have left the home and family, I have left this, I have left that…by saying all this if people think that they have found out path of Yoga then they are absolutely mistaken !. If you are an Escapist, and you have tendency of escapism then there is no cure for it. Wise person should think that we are in Prapancha and if we get anything by running away from it then what is the use? SUPPOSE YOU ARE TAKEN IN SOME JUNGLE AND YOU SIT THERE AND SAY, “ SEE I CAN LIVE WITHOUT WATER” THEN WHAT IS THE SPECIAL THING IN IT? LIVING IN WATER IF YOU DON’T NEED WATER, YOU ARE DETACHED FROM WATER, WHEN THIS STATE COMES THEN IT IS TRUE PRAPANCHA. THEN ONLY IS TRUE PRAPANCHA . AND WE NEED IT TODAY. WE NEED THAT PRAPANCHA. You all might be knowing about King Janaka. Nachiketa thought that this King Janaka who has crown on his head, he has all slaves and servants, there is dance going in front of him. When he comes in our Ashram my guru touches his feet? How is it that he is so great? So his Guru said to him that he should himself go and see. Nachiketa went and stood in front of Janaka and said, “ Please give me self realization, My Guru has said that you can give self realization, so please give me self realization” King Janaka said, “ look , if you would have asked me whole universe I would have given but I cannot give you realization, reason being that one who doesn’t know the subtle aspect of it then what is the use of giving it to such human being? The one who will understand its subtle aspect can only get deeper into it.” So, the tattwa of Prapancha is ‘Pr’ which means the light. Untill unless it is awakened within you all……you will remain in ‘Pancha’ and cannot enter in ‘Prapancha’. When Nachiketa asked the above question to King Janaka. King Janaka asked Nachiketa to be with him. I hope you know rest of the story. So I don’t have to repeat it. But at last Nachiketa understood that this man (King Janaka) has no attachments. He is not worried at all, neither he has any sticking with worldly things or what we call as world. He is like an ascetic. He will wear crown on his head of king and sleep on the ground, like a real Emperor. He doesn’t need any comforts, somewhere he will sleep on soft bed…sometimes lie on the ground….like an Emperor within. He is not worried of anything, he is not caught by anything. THE ONE WHO IS IN PRAPANCHA NEVER GETS EFFECTED BY ANY COMFORT OR ANY SLAVISHNESS TOWARDS MATERIAL. EVEN IF YOU ASK HIM TO SLEEP BY RESTING HIS HEAD ON STONE, HE CAN SLEEP. ASK HIM TO EAT ANYTHING, WITHOUT TASTE…HE CAN EAT AND ALSO HE CAN EAT IN PARTIES. IF YOU ASK HIM TOMORROW THAT, “ WHAT IS TO BE DONE NOW , WE HAVE TO MAKE AN ASHRAM SO HOW TO DO IT?” HE WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING PERFECTLY ABOUT IT. HE WILL GIVE YOU DETAILS OF MATERIAL TO BE USED AND THE QUALITY ETC…EVERYTHING. HE IS NOT STUCK TO ANYTHING WITHIN. THIS IS THE MATTER OF TATTWA. YOU ALL SHOULD UNDERSTAND IT. Namdeva has written one poetry and same has been added in Guru Grantha Sahib( Holy scripture of Sikh Religion) by Guru Nanaka. It is very beautiful. I would like to certainly describe it to you . It is written in that poetry; “The Kite (Zmeu) is flying above in sky and one child is holding its string. He is laughing, talking and moving to and fro but his attention is on Zmeu”. In another paragraph it says; “ Many women are going on street with pitchers on their head filled with the water from river and they are talking and joking, talking about their home etc but their whole attention is on the pitcher (Cana) that the water should not get spilled”. 

Same way there is one more description about the mother; “ One mother has child on her lap and she is doing all the work of house and kitchen, she does all the job in the house…sometimes bends down sometimes runs here and there….but her attention is on the child that he should not fall down” Same way is with the saints and yogis. They know to do all kind of work. They do all kind of work but their attention is always on their spirit. These all saints were like you people, living with their family, wife and children. After having all that they have one speciality and you all should understand that speciality by coming in that Tattwa. What is that speciality?…it is Sahaj Yoga ! You must also see that after getting that state what beneficial changes come within you. Because in Prapancha you always see profit and loss. What will you gain? What will you loose? But you must understand that God is beyond all this gain and loss. But many don’t know the meaning of it. In modern times if you talk about God then people think that ‘ this lady has never got modern education and she is reciting stories like our grandmothers’. But God is and he will ever exist. But we have to see how God works out things being in Prapancha. First of all see that is there any problem? Someone said to me, “ SHRI MATAJI MY HOUSE PROBLEMS….I DON’T HAVE ANY JOB” . SUCH KIND OF TALKS, MEAN TALKS, GROSS LEVEL TALKS, “ THIS IS LIKE THIS, LIKE THAT.. ETC”. AFTER SOME TIMES THE SAME FELLOW COMES AND SAYS, “ SHRI MATAJI EVERYTHING IS SOLVED, EVERYTHING BECAME ALRIGHT”. So, how all this happens? You must see this. Once it happened, I have one disciple from foreign country. I generally don’t call them ‘disciples’…I call them ‘children’. So both were girls. Both were going in a car in Germany. In Germany there are big highways called ‘Autoban’ and there are many vehicles moving very fast on it. So they wrote to me one letter, ‘ From both the sides there were truck , big buses, big cars which are double lords were going. Our car was in between…..its brakes were not working and the car was vobbling( shaking) So she thought that she is going to die now and she cant escape. If the break was alright then there were some chances, but it was also out of order. So, in that condition she got ‘inspiration’. The inspiration of emergency. It worked out. That is; now everything is finished, nothing is left, the time of destruction has come. So, she surrendered and said “ Shri Mataji now you only do something…whatever you want I am going to close my eyes”. She closed her eyes, it was written in her letter “ After some time I saw that the car was properly parked on one side and the break was also working.” Now , Shri Mataji did not do anything, you must see this. How does it happen? Means that whatever has happened , it has happened due to some cause. Means Cause and result. SUPPOSE SOME QUARREL HAS TAKEN PLACE IN YOUR HOUSE DUE TO YOUR WIFE, PARENTS OR SOME ‘X’ PERSON. THE RESULT IS DISTURBANCE IN HOUSE. THE ONE WHO HAS SIMPLE THINKING WILL KEEP ON FIGHTING WITH THE RESULT. “I HAVE TO FIGHT WITH IT!!” THEN SOME OTHER REASON WILL COME OUT TO FIGHT, THEN THIRD. NOW WHAT IS THE CAUSE? HOW MANY THINK ABOUT THE CAUSE OF QUARREL? THOSE WHO ARE WITH SUBTLE UNDERSTANDING FIGHT WITH THE CAUSE OF THE QUARREL. FIGHTING THE OTHER WAY MAKES THE RESULT TO FIGHT BACK AND THEY GET INTO THE CYCLE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT AND THE PROBLEM REMAINS UNSOLVED. THEY CANNOT GO BEYOND IT. THEREFORE TO PRACTICE PRAPANCHA IS VERY DIFFICULT, EVERYONE SAYS LIKE THIS. WHAT IS THE CURE OF IT? THE CURE IS THAT WHATEVER IS THE CAUSE OF IT, YOU HAVE TO GO BEYOND THE CAUSE. The cause was that the break( of Car) was broken, She was fighting with the break. But when she realized that there is something beyond it….Shakti (power) and by going beyond that cause , the cause got terminated. Also the effect got terminated. It is like this. You believe it or not, but it happens like this. It is not blind faith. Many people come to me and say, “ Shri Mataji we remember God so much but we are suffering from Cancer, how is it?…we go to temples, Go to siddhavinayaka and stand there for hours. Specially we go there on Tuesdays, but nothing good happened with us, this God never did anything good with us so why should we worship him?” Alright. But the God whom you are calling…..is he connected with you? Till you are connected with him, how can something good happen with you? You must have telephone connection with God. You keep worshipping God day and night, but whatever you are praying..is it reaching to God? Whatever stupid things you do and behave in stupid way and then you come and say that God did not give you anything. Why should God give you something? Once you are connected with Government of India then you can ask some favour because you are citizen of India and not of the Kingdom of God. First become the citizen of Kingdom of God and then you will see that even before thinking about the problem it will be solved by God. Now imagine that by sitting here if you start saying that the queen of England did not do anything for you. Why should she do something for you? So, here is God and why should God do something for you? You have not entered into his Kingdom. Only to dictate on him “OH ! LORD”. As if he is in your pocket. 

Now even people don’t know that they should remember God. They have not said remember but they have said to auspicious remembering ( Susmaran ) of God. ‘Su’ word is just like ‘Pra’. ‘Su’ means where you have become auspicious by becoming human beings and you are blessed. Otherwise you keep on taking the name of God like Parrot (Papagal). It influences the young generation. They say, “ What is the mening of this God? Two people came here taking the name of God and took money from our mother, there some people came and tied black thread in the neck and took away money. What does this kind of God means?” Then some people start talking like them and say that there is no God. But first of all we commit the mistake that are we connected to God? You must see this. First establish the connection with God!. Now, Sahaj Yoga means to connect yourself with the Divine. ‘Sah’ means ‘with you’ and ‘Ja’ means ‘born with you’. Yoga within you since birth. The right to get Yoga Sidhhi is Sahaj Yoga. God has kept within you a Divine Energy called Kundalini. Whether you believe it or not. BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE PEOPLE WITH EXTERNAL EYES TO BELIEVE. SPECIALLY THE INTELLECTUALS AND LITERARY PEOPLE MOVE WITH MENTAL THOUGHTS. AND UPTO WHERE WILL THEIR THOUGHTS REACH…NO ONE KNOWS. ONE THINKING DOES NOT MATCH WITH THE OTHER. THIS IS WHY THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENCES. SO THE POWER WHICH IS BEYOND THESE THOUGHTS OR MENTAL ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED SINCE ANCIENT TIMES IN OUR COUNTRY. IT IS NEEDED TO PUT YOUR ATTENTION ON THAT. BUT THESE INTELLECTUALS HAVE SO MUCH EGO THAT THEY ARE NOT READY TO PAY ATTENTION THIS SIDE. MAY BE IT IS SOMEWHERE CONCERNED WITH THEIR LIVELIHOOD. BUT AFTER COMING TO SAHAJ YOGA YOU ARE BLESSED WITH WELL BEING. AFTER GETTING CONNECTED WITH GOD YOUR PROBLEMS DISAPPEAR IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU ARE SURPRISED. “ WHAT DID WE DO?” “HOW DID GOD GIVE US SO MUCH? HOW EVERYTHING GOT ARRANGED IN SUCH BEAUTIFUL WAY?” YOU ASK YOURSELF THESE QUESTIONS AND GET AMAZED. You might have read the last paragraph of Gyaneshwara’s Pasaydan. What he has described is the condition of today. It has to work out in this way. Whatever one will desire will be fulfilled. But before desiring it you have to awaken your Kundalini. I cannot promise you anything before that. Neither I assure you like ministers and leaders. Whatever the truth is, I am speaking it in my language and in my way. I am not speaking to you in literary or philosophical way. I am teaching you in the same way as a mother teaches her child about household things. You must receive the treasure within you. You say that you are tied in Prapancha. ‘Tied’ means what? It means that you are giving importance to the stupid and useless things. “ I must get a good Job, why I am not getting it? because unemployment is there , means unemployed are increasing. It will keep on increasing. So, how to go beyond all this stupid thinking? The cure is that you have to awaken the power which is around us. We have that Power in Mooladhara Chakra. You will see that how this Power within you in your Mooladhara works out in this Prapancha. Your attention should be towards that power. And first of all you must know that this power of Kundalini which is in your Mooladhara is due to Shri Ganesha. Now , we should say that this Maharashtra is blessed. Here we have Ashtavinayaks( Eight forms of Shri Ganesha) which are great blessing of God for you. This is the reason that I have been able to establish Sahaj Yoga in Maharashtra. Because the power of Shri Ganesha covers you. I have been helped a lot because of that covering. This Shri Ganesha is sitting in your Mooladhara. Now, if there is some doctor, he will keep the photograph of shri Ganesha in his house. He will construct temple also. He will go and bow there. But he will never understand the relation of medical science with Shri Ganesha. He wont even accept it. But without Shri Ganesha even medical science is worthless. Because of this Ganesha’s Power you can produce children. Imagine that the face of child resembles the face of parents. There are millions of people all over the world but every child resembles his parents or the grandparents or some relative of that family. Who controls this balance and regulation? It is only Shri Ganesha. 

YOU ALL ARE SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT THE CHILD LIKE INNOCENCE OF YOUR CHILDREN. THAT INNOCENCE SHOULD COME WITHIN YOU. THERE ARE SMALL CHILDREN IN HOUSE. HOW INNOCENT THEY ARE. WE SPEAK BAD WORDS IN FRONT OF THEM. WE BRING THEM UP IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE EVERYTHING IS INAUSPICIOUS. NO ONE PUTS ATTENTION ON THEM AND WE LET THEM DO ANYTHING. THESE CHILDREN ARE SHRI GANESHA OF YOUR HOUSE AND FAMILY. YOU ARE NOT EVEN BOTHERED TO LOOK AFTER THEM AND TO BRING THEM UP PROPERLY. NOWADAYS EVEN 80 YEARS OLD WOMEN MARRIES IN ENGLAND. I DON’T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING WHAT TO SAY. PLEASE DO NOT BRING THE FILTH AND DIRTY THINGS OF WEST HERE. LET THE DIRTY THINGS OF WEST REMAIN IN WEST. “ TE ATI SHYANHE TYANCHE VAIL RIKAME ( THOSE WHO ARE TOO CLEVER HAVE EMPTY HEAD). SO IF SHRI GANESHA’S CURSE SHOULD NOT FALL ON US, WE HAVE TO ASSURE IT. SHRI GANESHA SITS INSIDE US AND BRINGS UP OUR CHILDREN. FIRST GIVING BIRTH AND THEN UPBRINGING. AND THAT INNOCENT GANESHA( CHILD) GIVES JOY TO EVERYONE IN FAMILY. THERE IS TREMENDOUS JOY IN THE FAMILY WHERE A CHILD IS BORN. HOW MANY WAVES OF JOY FLOW FROM COMING OF THAT CHILD. BUT THE HOUSE WHERE CHILDREN ARE NOT BORN, THERE IS SO MUCH FEELING OF EMPTINESS. YOU FEEL AS IF NOT TO VISIT THAT HOUSE. BECAUSE THERE IS NO GIGGLING OF THE CHILD THERE.NO JOY AT ALL. THERE IS NO SWEETNESS IN SUCH HOUSE. BUT NOW THE TIME HAS CHANGED. CHILDREN ARE NOT BORN IN THE COUNTRIES WHICH WE CALL AS AFFLUENT OR RICH COUNTRIES. THEIR POPULATION IS DECREASING. OUR COUNTRY’S POPULATION IS INCREASING. PEOPLE SAY IT IS VERY BAD. YOUR COUNTRY’S POPULATION SHOULD NOT INCREASE. WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE CHILDREN WHO ARE TAKING BIRTH ALSO HAVE WISDOM. WHY SHOULD THEY TAKE BIRTH IN THOSE WESTERN COUNTRIES. THEY WILL SAY THAT THERE HUSBAND AND WIFE DIVORCE EVERYDAY AND KILL THEIR CHILDREN. THE SAME WILL HAPPEN TO US. BECAUSE ONLY HERE( IN INDIA) PARENTS HAVE THAT DEDICATION AND LOVE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND HAVE THAT SAHAJ WAY OF LIVING WHICH IS NOT IN RICH (WESTERN) COUNTRIES, NOT AT ALL. YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT IN LONDON CITY THE PARENTS KILL THEIR TWO CHILDREN IN ONE WEEK. EVERYDAY I GET SHOCKS. AND THEY ARE NOT AT ALL EFFECTED BY IT. THEY ARE LOST IN SO MUCH EGO THAT THEY DON’T FEEL THAT WHAT CRIME THEY ARE DOING. AFTER LIVING THERE I REALIZED THAT HOW NICE IS INDIAN MEN AND WOMEN. HERE IN INDIA THE TELEPHONES DO NOT WORK, MICROPHONES DO NOT WORK, TRAINS DO NOT FUNCTION…..I AGREE BUT THE HUMAN BEINGS FUNCTION PERFECTLY. The subtlest of subtle in that is Ganesha Tattwa. And the house which does not have good Ganesha Tattwa has everything improper. I BLAME THE SPOILING OF CHILDREN ON THE PARENTS. NOWADAYS EVEN THE MOTHER GOES OUT TO WORK. MEN ALREADY WORK. STILL IT IS IMPORTANT TO SEE THAT HOW MUCH DEEP IS THE TIME YOU DEVOTE TO YOUR CHILDREN. Now what happens after coming to sahaj Yoga. Means how sahaj Yoga is related to your children is very important to see. In sahaj Yoga your Ganesha’s Power gets awakened because of Kundalini. The first thing which comes is wisdom. We call it Vinayaka( Ganesha). He only gives wisdom to everyone. People bring children to me who are very poor in studies. I have seen such children whom the parents bring to me and say that their child is zero in the class. He only does mischieves and speaks stupid with his teacher. I asked the child, “ why do you do like this?” He said, I don’t know anything and teacher keeps on scolding me always. “Then what should I do?”. The same child came first class first in his class. How did it happen? That power starts flowing within you as soon as Ganesha is awakened within you and a new dimension starts in human being. That dimension is called collective consciousness. The things which a person cannot see or feel before now through this new awareness he starts feeling them in Sahaj way. This new dimension or say this new consciousness makes a person truly capable. And through that capability a miracle takes place. The children who are useless and are of no worth, like those who drink wine etc. You know that nowadays there is lot of drugs used. I never saw a thing called marijuana. Now I have come to know that they sell it in schools. This all stupidity is because of no wisdom. When this wisdom gets awakened , all those living in England and America became very good citizens. 

This is the power of Sahaj Yoga. Children get disciplined. I SEE THAT TODAY THERE IS NO DISCIPLINE IN CHILDREN BECAUSE MOTHER AND FATHER FIGHT AND QUARREL WITH EACH OTHER AND DO NOT RESPECT THEIR CHILDREN. THEY BEHAVE VERY BADLY WITH THEM. THE CHILDREN BEHAVE LIKE THEIR PARENTS AND DO STUPID AND INDISCIPLINED THINGS LIKE THEIR PARENTS BEHAVE. AFTER COMING TO SAHAJ YOGA IF THE PARENT’S KUNDALINI IS AWAKENED AND ALSO OF THE CHILDREN THEN EVERYONE BEHAVES IN PROPER MANNER. FIRST THE SELF RESPECT IS AWAKENED WITHIN. BY GIVING LECTURES YOU CANNOT AWAKEN SELF RESPECT IN THEM. BUT BY AWAKENING OF KUNDALINI IN SAHAJ YOGA, A PERSON GETS SELF RESPECT. In our country there is a process of respecting the one who is in power. But the true power is of shri Ganesha. Whoever has his power, you should bow to his feet. Rest all will come today and go tomorrow. They have no importance, they all are useless people. Those who have awakened Ganesha within them, you must bow in front of them only. There is tremendous change in a person when Ganesha’s power is awakened. AS YOU SEE TODAY THAT THE EYES OF MEN IS ALWAYS FLITTERING HERE AND THERE…AND THE AGNYA CHAKRA IS BADLY CAUGHT. LIKE FOOLS THEY KEEP LOOKING HERE AND THERE. THERE IS BIG NUMBER OF SUCH MEN TODAY. IT HAS ALSO STARTED IN MAHARASHTRA. WHEN I WAS SMALL AND WAS STUDYING IN SCHOOLS. I NEVER SAW SUCH STUPID MEN AT THAT TIME. BUT NOW THESE NEW CREATURES HAVE COME. THEY ALWAYS KEEP ROTATING THERE EYES HERE AND THERE. ALWAYS SEEING HERE AND THERE, LIKE THE ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE WAY. YOU LOOSE MUCH POWER AND ENERGY BY THAT. THERE IS NO JOY IN DOING LIKE THIS. IT IS JOYLESS PURSUIT AS WE CAN SAY. THEY PUT ALL THEIR ATTENTION ON THAT AND KEEP ROVING THEIR EYES HERE AND THERE. IF THEY MISS SOME ADVERTISEMENT BY MISTAKE THEN THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE LOST SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT. THEY WILL ROTATE THEIR EYE AGAIN AND READ THE ADVERTISEMENT. IT IS VERY NECESSARY FOR THEM TO SEE EVERYTHING. THIS DISEASE OF EYES GETS TERMINATED AND THE PERSON BECOMES CONCENTRATED AT SPIRIT IN SAHAJ YOGA. THEN YOU GET STABLE VISION. IF THIS STATE OF EYE IS AWAKENED THEN WE CALL IT “KATAKSHA NIRIKSHANA”( INSPECTION IN EVERY GLANCE). WHERE EVER YOUR GLANCE WILL GO YOU WILL AWAKEN THE KUNDALINI. WHOMEVER YOU WILL SEE WILL GET PURIFIED. SUCH PURITY WILL COME IN EYES….THIS IS ALONE THE TASK OF SHRI GANESHA. YOU HAVE NOT RECOGNIZED YOUR GANESHA. IF YOU WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THEN YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN STABLE IN YOUR PURITY. WHATEVER IS PURE , ONLY THAT YOU MUST DO. BUT YOU DID NOT WORSHIP YOUR GANESHA. DOESN’T MATTER. YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN YOUR HOUSE, WATCH THEIR GANESHA. MAKE THEM ADORABLE AND YOU ALSO YOUR GANESHA. Get your Kundalini awakened. But the speciality of Sahaj Yoga is that it all happens spontaneous. You have to do nothing for it. By awakening of Kundalini, man gets wisdom and his whole personality becomes special. Now if there are some intellectuals, they would say that Mataji is telling some illusionary story. But you will be surprised to hear that in Ahmadnagar( Loc in Maharashtra) 10000 people left drinking. I don’t say that there should be prohibition of liquor…I don’t say anything like this. However you are you must come to Sahaj Yoga. You must come and enlighten the lamp of your spirit. After enlightening of that lamp all the faults will be seen clearly. Till that lamp is lightened, you cannot see if something is sticked on your Sari. In the same way you can see everything clearly. Even if it is lightened a little, you will be able to see your weaknesses.You become your own Guru and correct yourself.Make yourself pure. There is no limit of the joy amongst those who are purified. Someone has said, “ jab mast hue tab kya bole?”( Once we drowned into joy then what is there to speak?). this becomes the condition once we come into the state of bliss. Purity is blissful !, not only blissful but it makes the complete personality fragrant. If such a person is standing anywhere, people will say, “ This gentleman has something special” . Sahaj Yoga is not for the persons who don’t want to become Special!. Those who have to become , will become special. It is well known that you are going to become extraordinary and special people. You have to earn this blessing ! sahaj yoga is for all those who are living with family and children and want to become special people. THOSE WHO THINK THAT THEY DON’T WANT TO BECOME SPECIAL AND THEY ARE ALRIGHT AS THEY ARE AND SAY THAT THEY DON’T WANT ANYTHING FROM MATAJI, THEN ITS ALRIGHT I DO NAMASKAR TO THEM. THEY CAN VISIT BUT WE CANT FORCE REALIZATION ON THEM. IF YOU WANT COMPLETE FREEDOM, THEN I HAVE TO LOOK AFTER YOUR FREEDOM. IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO HELL( IAD) SO BETTER GO THERE AND IF YOU HAVE TO COME TO HEAVEN(PARADIS) THEN YOU ARE WELCOME !! I CANNOT FORCE YOU AT ALL. FIRST OF ALL IN PRAPANCHA( FAMILY LIFE) A CHILD IS SOURCE OF JOY. FROM THE BEGINNING OF PREGNANCY, THERE IS JOY IN THE HOUSE. AFTER THE PAINS OF MOTHER ARE OVER THE CHILD TAKES BIRTH IN HAPPY SURROUNDINGS. I HAVE SEEN NOWADAYS THAT THOSE WHO ARE REALIZED HAVE THE CHILDREN WHO ARE REALIZED FROM BIRTH ITSELF. NO MATTER THEY ARE LIVING ANYWHERE. THERE ARE MANY REALIZED SOULS WHO HAVE TO TAKE BIRTH. I AM SEEING EVERYONE, THEY SAY, “ WHO IS THE ONE WHO WILL KEEP OUR SPIRIT ENLIGHTENED” SAINTS DO NOT TAKE BIRTH THROUGH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WORTH IT. SUCH GREAT SOULS HAVE TO TAKE BIRTH AND FOR THEM SUCH REALIZED YOGIS ARE REQUIRED. THEIR PRAPANCHA WILL BE TRULY ENLIGHTENED. AND FOR SUCH ENLIGHTENED PRAPANCHA CREATION YOU HAVE TO COME TO SAHAJ YOGA AND AWAKEN YOUR KUNDALINI. 

After this we come to second chakra which is called Swadishthan in which there are lot of Prapanchas. There are many benefits in your Prapancha through it. Swadishthan’s first work is to make your Guru principal strong. I have seen in many houses that the father is not respected at all, mother is not respected at all. The small 15 years old children are everything there. I see nowadays in the market that it is very difficult to get a Sari for an elderly person like me. All Saris are for young girls. For elders and old people they don’t make Saris anymore. There used to be money with elders in previous times. Everything used to be good for them. Now no one is concerned about old and elder people. It has become difficult for them to even get one sari for some marriage occasion etc. When this Guru shakti is awakened within you then this old age which comes is full of radiation. Now if I take some elderly and old person. The father or Grandfather also behave like stupids sometimes. Mother behaves like a stupid fool. She doesn’t know how she has to live in front of the other people who come from outside. She always keeps on shouting. All her attention is on the keys of the house or on the quarrels of caste system. A konkanastha( A caste in south Maharashtra) should be married to Konkanastha. THE COUNTRY BOY SHOULD BE MARRIED TO SAME COUNTRY’S GIRL. IF IT IS NOT SO THEN THE MOTHER IN LAW QUARRELS WITH HER DAUGHTER IN LAW. THIS STUPIDITIES OF ELDERS END AFTER COMING TO SAHAJ YOGA. INSTEAD OF IT IN THAT OLD AGE THERE IS A KIND OF RADIATION. THAT PERSON STANDS IN HIS PRIDE. YOU WILL FEEL THAT OH!MY GOD WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MY FATHER. YOU WILL FEEL THAT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE FROM ANCIENT TIME OF SHIVAJI . AND YOU WILL GET BOWED IN FRONT OF THEM. So the agitation which is in this youth of today, talking divorce on little problem, fighting with wife, not having good relations with parents, cannot live in house, running away from house. This all is happening today. There is no job, no money and all bad habbits inside. From all the direction our youth is moving towards destruction. In fact their background in India is very great. But I tell you that Maharashtra’s background is very great. 

hey forget everything and don’t study or understand. Now, how much knowledge of music they have in Maharashtra. There is lot of literature of saints in Marathi language. But who reads such books now? They purchase dirty books from the street and read. Very superficial things…not going deeper but floating on top. This is the condition of Yuva (young ) generation. If it continues then they all will be lost. They will become useless. ASK ME ! I WENT TO AMERICA AND THERE ARE 65% JOBLESS PEOPLE. THERE THEY ARE AFRAID OF A DISEASE CALLED AIDS. ALL YOUNG GENERATION IS DYING AND CANT UNDERSTAND HOW TO ESCAPE FROM IT. ITS REASON IS “WHATS WRONG”. “THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAINT RAMADASA WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH HIM , KEEP THIS ALL WITH YOU, WE ARE BECOMING MODERN NOW”. THIS STUPID MODERNITY!. WHERE THOSE MODERN AMERICANS ARE GOING? YOU GO TO THOSE COUNTRIES ONCE WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THOSE MODERN PEOPLE. THE WRITERS HERE KEEP WRITING ABOUT THOSE COUNTRIES SITTING HERE. GO THERE AND SEE WHATS HAPPENING IN THOSE MODERN COUNTRIES. THE ELDERS THERE KEEP THINKING DAY AND NIGHT THAT HOW TO COMMIT SUICIDE. THEY HAVE ONLY ONE THOUGHT AND THAT IS SUICIDE. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY LEFT WITH THEM. YOU WANT TO BECOME MODERN LIKE THEM WHO WILL VANISH IN THIN AIR ONE DAY. THEN I BOW TO YOU, YOU MAY GO OUT OF SAHAJ YOGA. BUT, YOU HAVE TO BE FIRM ON YOUR SHAKTI AND YOU HAVE TO BECOME SPECIAL. THEN YOU HAVE TO STOP A LITTLE FROM YOUR FAST JOURNEY. THINK IN SILENCE THAT “ AM I ALSO RUNNING WITH ALL THESE WESTERN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN RAT RACE?” YOU MUST THINK PEACEFULLY ABOUT THE HERITAGE OF INDIA. DURING PARTITION OF PROPERTY IF THEY GET EVEN ONE CLOTH LESS THEN THEY GO TO COURT TO FIGHT THE CASE. BUT IT IS GREAT HERITAGE OF OUR COUNTRY WHERE NO ONE IS PUTTING ATTENTION, IT IS GOING TO FINISH NOW. HOW MUCH WE HAVE TAKEN BENEFIT FROM IT. THE ELDERS GET THIS KNOWLEDGE AFTER COMING TO SAHAJ YOGA. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT HOW MUCH HIGHER THEY HAVE GONE FROM THEIR STATE BEFORE REALIZATION. IN MY CHILDHOOD MY FATHER SAID TO ME, “ FIRST OF ALL THIS YOUNG GENERATION SHOULD BE AWAKENED”. The sages sitting on 10th floor( state of realization) cannot understand the state of the person who is on the first step. These common people sing bhajans but do not know the feelings which are connected with the songs. When they will reach to first stage then they will realize that there is further steps ahead. So , beyond this human awareness there is greater awareness called “Ritambhara Shakti” you get it in Sahaj. After achieveing it you will be able to have vision of your life. What are we , how great we are and is it good to play with your life? How much treasure you have, how much have you kept your self respect? You don’t know anything about yourself. Try to understand this and get realization in Sahaj Yoga. What is the condition of young generation today. All of them can come to sahaj yoga. It is very easy to give realization to younger generation. They commit mistakes in their innocence. It is all innocence. One boy smokes cigarrete then I should also do it. If someone is wearing good clothes then I should also wear. All innocence, but sometimes this innocence can be destructive . What is lacking today in our country. Someone will say that it is food. But I don’t see any such problem. I feel that we eat too much and give to others. Whenever I come here, I do namaskar and say, “ please finish it, I don’t want anymore food” Every person there says that there is no problem or scarcity of food in India because they request you to eat a lot that they feel not to eat at all. So what is deficient in our country? People are very smart in discussions and arguments. If they are standing here, they can give great lectures than even mine.

We are very smart in everything else. A little oversmart.. We have everything, Gold, silver….what is not there? Think and find out where we are lacking? Only one thing lacks and it is that we don’t know who we are? It is not known that “ who am I”. When this will take place within you then your whole body will get filled of joy and vibrations will start flowing from your body. It is not guaranteed that it should happen inside you. It can and it cannot. If not today then tomorrow it will take place. In this Prapancha( family life) you have economic problems. In Maharashtra they say, “ Shri Mataji how will the poors get benefits from you?” What are you? Poor , Rich or Middle class? What profit you want whether you are rich , poor or middle class? No one is satisfied. If you have Radio then you want Vedio then air condition then Aeroplane. God knows what more…… It is great principle of Economics that Demands are never satiable. If one desire is there then it will be fulfilled. But generally it is not so. Today you have one desire, tomorrow another. One thing is clear that what you desired was not pure desire. If it was pure desire then you might have got complete satisfaction and contentment after getting it. But it is not so. Means your desire was not pure but impure. That is why you kept moving from one to another. Now,pure desire is your Kundalini. Because it is the desire of God. After its awakening you will desire and it will be fulfilled. So much that you will say that You don’t want anything more. Whatever desires you have are fulfilled. But those desires are not for gross things. It has a kind of benevolence. And all your little desires are fulfilled as said by Krishna “ Yogakshemam Vahamyaham” When your Yoga will establish then you will get blessings. But he said Yoga first and not the blessings. Sudama(Poor friend of Krishna) had to go to meet him and after that only His city was created in Gold. Why do you show your domination on God ? why did you buy flowers of four rupees and gave to God? So you are mistaken on that. I have seen many people who are Shiva bhaktas( devotees of shiva) They keep on reciting shiva’s name and get heart attack. Shiva is sitiing in your heart then how is it? why did they get heart attack? Because Shiva got angry. If you keep calling some person continuously then even that person will get irritated. If you go to Prime minister’s house ,repeat his name then you will be sent to prison. This is happening. Neither they getGod , nor the Prapancha. 

This is the state. This is why it is very important to come to central path. When Kundalini is awakened through it then a person gets established. He becomes contented within. The rules of God have science in them. You must learn them first . you commit mistakes without knowing the protocols of Divine. Then if something gets spoiled then why do you blame God? I have come on this Earth to prove if God is there or not. Certainly to prove it. Divine cool breeze will flow from your hands. You will receive God on your finger tips.But the preparation is needed. THIS MIND ALWAYS FOOLS. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN WITH COOL MIND WHATEVER I SAY, THEN IT WILL WORK OUT. IF YOUR PROBLEMS WOULD HAVE RESOLVED BY YOUR MENTAL LEVEL THEN THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ME TO WORK SO HARD FOR YOU ALL. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET RESOLVED BY YOUR MIND.NEITHER YOUR FAMILY PROBLEMS, POLITICAL PROBLEMS OR SOCIAL PROBLEMS WILL GET SOLVED BY YOUR MIND. POLITICAL PROBLEMS ARE LIKE, “ WE ARE CAPITALISTS” AND WE FIGHT FOR IT. ARE THEY HAPPY? CAN THEY CONTROL THIR FREEDOM? OTHERS SAY THAT WE ARE COMMUNIST. BUT, WE ARE TRUE CAPITALISTS BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THE POWERS. ALL THESE ARE MUNDANE LEVEL TALKS. DON’T GET STUCK WITH THEM. YOU MUST BRING THE GOD’S KINGDOM WITHIN YOU AND BECOME ITS CITIZEN.THEN YOU WILL SEE WHAT YOU WILL BECOME. FOR THAT YOU DON’T HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR FAMILY LIFE. NO NEED TO GIVE MONEY FOR IT. THIS IS THE LIVING THING. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU PAY FOR A TREE TO GIVE FLOWERS? WHAT DOES IT KNOW ABOUT MONEY? SAME WAY IS GOD. HE DOESN’T KNOW ABOUT MONEY. IN THE VILLAGE THEY SAID THAT SHRI MATAJI DOESN’T TAKE MONEY. SO, THEY SAID ALRIGHT THEN LET US GIVE AT LEAST 10 PAISE OR 15 PAISE. BUT FOR WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PAY? SELF REALIZATION IS YOUR OWN. WILL YOU PURCHASE IT FOR YOURSELF FROM YOURSELF? EVERYTHING WORKS OUT WITH THE POWER OF LOVE. YOU HAVE TO RECEIVE THAT LOVE. YOU DONT FIND IT TODAY PRAPANCHA. YOU SEE THE LOVE IN VERY DIFFERENT MANNER. YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN SOME TREE. ITS NUTRITION RUNS UPWARD FROM ROOT AND WHICH PART NEEDS AND HOW MUCH IT NEEDS IT SUPPLIES. IT DOESN’T GET STUCK OR ATTACHED WITH ONE FLOWER OR LEAF.IF IT GETS STUCK THEN THAT LEAF WILL DIE AND ALSO THE TREE WILL DIE. SAME WAY WE ARE ALSO THERE. OUR LOVE MEANS , “ MY SON, MY JOB” YOUR SON BECOMES THE EMPEROR OF WORLD! MY DAUGHTER ETC…. MY MY. IS IT ALL YOURS? BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND BY LISTENING OR TALKING. WHATEVER YOU SAY, THIS ‘MY’ DOESN’T GO AWAY. TO GET DETACHED FROM ALL THIS YOUR KUNDALINI SHOULD GET AWAKENED. AFTER AWAKENING YOU SAY “ YOUR – YOUR”. Kabira has said that when the Goat ( Capra) is alive it repeats “ mein- mein”( Eu –Eu). But after its death its intestines are taken out and an instrument is made then that instrument says “ TU HI TU HI” ( Numai Tu). 

Once your Kundalini gets awakened then you feel that everything is yours and nothing belongs to me. People are surprised and amazed to see this. In this Bombay city itself so many have got better life through Prapancha. But if you don’t want to do then don’t do it. SHRI KRISHNA CAME WITH A PURPOSE. HE DID KRASHI ( AGRICULTURA). HE SOWED THE SEEDS. TODAY THAT HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS STAGE. YOU ARE GOING TO BECOME FRUITS OUT OF FLOWERS. YOU MUST ACCEPT ALL THIS. IF YOU MISS IT THIS TIME THEN YOU WILL MISS IT FOR EVER. All your problems get over and you come to kingdom of God. you are not going to get joy anywhere except his kingdom. The sorrow of whole world get finished after coming to the lotus feet of God. That doesn’t mean that you go to Vitthala temple and break your head. You have to awaken Vithala( Krishna) within yourself. How you have to awaken? For that you don’t have to do anything. He is present within you. After awakening of Kundalini as lamp is lightened, it lightens within you. In the house where the lamp of God is lightened then how can sorrow and pain come? How can there be poverty and problems? There has to be the world full of joy. This is the reason why I go from village to village. It is my humble request to you all that you must get your this power awakened and become auspicious for whole world. I FOLD MY HANDS TO YOU AND REQUEST YOU !.
