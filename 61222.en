1987-0506 Meeting with Sahaja Yogis., Sydney, Australia.    Starts at: 0.21.39

I was thinking there's one point which you can tell them that, you see this human awareness is not at its best, it not at its absolute. So what the evolutionary process is working. And because of that natural evolutionary process the time has come for many to break through, when that goes into their head. It it better. That is one point. And I was thinking why not have [unclear] at tomorrow's interview [unclear]. For tomorrow's 8.30 interview. You can say that. A psychiatrist is coming all the way from Viard and all that. So you could have them for the interview tomorrow, 8.30.

Sahaja Yogi: Excuse me Mother, between your radio interview tomorrow and the television there is one and a half hours and if it would be possible we could take you to the man himself in that one and a half hours.

Shri Mataji: One and a half hours between My interview.

S.Y. Between the ABC interview at 10.00 and the Ray Martin show at 12.00.

Shri Mataji:  Yes, that's true but to there's the 8.30 one which?

S.Y. That's the same one Mother. Instead of at 8.30.

Shri Mataji:  That's the one they have put it at ten o'clock.

S.Y. The one today that;s now, they've put it at 8.30 but we could stop that 8.30 and between 10. o'clock and 12. o'clock. In the car take You to the radio station, instead of them coming out here because we will be in the city of Sydney.  We will be in the city at 10.00 at the ABC.

Shri Mataji:  All right in between we can do that.

S.Y He's very anxious. He's very anxious to do it.

Shri Mataji: Nice marathon for doing it. It's very good. It can work out. It's not difficult that way.  We can. Once we are in the city we can do from one to another, to another, it's good. So now shall we go out for a while?  And we'll be back. Don't worry about lunch we can have some lunch somewhere outside and we back here for little bit after.
