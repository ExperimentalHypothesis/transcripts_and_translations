1987-05-06 Meeting with Sahaja Yogis., Sydney, Australia.    Starts at: 0.21.39

[Shri Mataji is listening to a pre-recorded interview where Sahaja Yoga is being explained to a reporter by two Australian Yogis – Stephen Taylor and James Blackley. Yogis applaud when it ends.]

Shri Mataji: Very well done. I was thinking, there’s one point which you can tell them that, you see, human awareness is not at its best, is not at its absolute. So the – what is the evolutionary process is working. And because of that natural evolutionary process, the time has come for many to break through, then that goes into their head, I think is better. That is one point. And I was thinking why not have Rustom for tomorrow’s interview – Rustom and [unclear/him] for tomorrow’s 8:30 interview. You can say that: there’s a psychiatrist coming all the way from Viard and all that. So you could have them for the interview tomorrow, [replying to someone aside: 8:30. Yes, of course.]

Sahaja Yogi One: Excuse me Shri Mother, between Your radio interview tomorrow and the television, there is one and a half hours and if it would be possible, we could take You to the man himself in that one and a half hours.

Shri Mataji: One and a half hours between My interview...

Sahaja Yogi Two: Between the ABC interview at 10 o’clock and the Ray Martin show at 12 o’clock.

Shri Mataji:  Yes, that’s true but there’s one 8:30 which...

Sahaja Yogi One: That’s the same one Mother.

Sahaja Yogi Two: That’s the... instead of at 8:30...

Shri Mataji:  That’s the one; they have put it at 10 o’clock.

Sahaja Yogi Two: The one today, now, they’ve put it at 8:30 but we could stop that 8:30, and between 10 o’clock and 12 o’clock, in the car, take You to the radio station, instead of them coming out here, because we will be in the city of Sydney.  We will be in the city at 10 o’clock at the ABC.

Shri Mataji:  All right, in between then we can do that. Yes, it’s all right.

Sahaja Yogi One: He’s very anxious. He’s very anxious to do it.

Shri Mataji: It’s a nice marathon working out; I like it. It’s very good. It can work out. It’s not difficult that way.  We can. Once we are in the city we can do from one to another, to another, yes, it’s good. So now, should we go out for a while?  And we’ll be back soon. Don’t worry about lunch; we can have some lunch somewhere outside and we’ll back here for little bit afterwards. [speaks Hindi aside]
