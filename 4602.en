Evening before Guru Puja. Gmunden (Austria), 5 July 1986.

Shri Mataji: ...who has seen the Sahaja Yogis dancing and singing the praise has seen Me in the villages of India. It is very clearly described in that. You can have a look at it how they saw the real picture of truth.

And the second one, we'll read it out to you about the great poet in India, called Rabindranath Tagore, what he saw at Ganapatipule. Where you might see the word called Bharat. Bharat is the real word of India. India was given the name to us by Alexander (ed: the Great), but actually the real name of India is Bharat. Because there was a great king called Bharat. From there this word comes - Bharat. All right. So first they will read out the part which is about the vision he saw. Which is so clear cut. Those who have been to India have been dancing on the streets of India in villages, Indian villages. We remember exactly what it is how he saw you right there.

Sahaja Yogi: So this is an excerpt from a book by C.S. Lewis, called 'The Great Divorce'.

Shri Mataji: C.S. Lewis from - Lewis means he is a welsh by birth, welsh people have something to do with Maharashtra, I must say, because they called Bombay as Mumbai, still. They don't call it Bombay. And that means they must have been going to India much before the English reached there.

Sahaja Yogi: The reason why I asked: if there was another river was this: all down one long aisle of the forest the undersights of the leafy branches have begun to tremble with dancing light.

Shri Mataji: Slowly. Slowly, because they don't understand English. So, do it slowly and deliberately. First of all, again.

Slowly, Warren, now it's too speedy. (Laughter) Very speedy. Speed should be less, I asked you because your speed is normally very low. I think, why not ask James. James, you come along. Let's have James.

He's still not there.

All right. Start it.

Now he's there. Come along. Warren is in a big speed today, I don't know why. What are you up to? (Shri Mataji laughing) You see, because they don't understand English, you see. So I also require little pauses.

I think it should be raised a little more to the mouthpiece. Meant for you, not for Warren. (Laughter and applause)

Again.

Sahaja Yogi: Forgive me, I'll start again.

Shri Mataji: It's good now.

(reading of poem)

Shri Mataji: Bring it down that height. All right.

This is about Ganapatipule, just see, how it is described. Both the poets are no more now.

Sahaja Yogi: From Gitanjali by Rabindranath Tagore: ("On the shores of Bharat where men of all races have come together. Awake, my mind...")

Shri Mataji: So, just to begin with the whole thing as I said in the morning that Austria never gave Me any problems. We have to admit beyond doubt that in Sahaja Yoga Australia is the most progressive country. (Applause)

Credit must go to Dr. Warren, who has started Sahaja Yoga there and to James, who is carrying on the work of Sahaja Yoga in the absence of Warren. It's something great.

(Gregoire translates)

Shri Mataji: And a full progress can be seen as far as the schooling is concerned in that great country of Shri Ganesha. Where school has to be established first, because it's a Ganesha's country, but the way they have got beautiful remarks from the government saying that whatever they proclaimed, whatever they preach, they practice. It's such a big thing to say.

And beautiful reports they have got. And I hope that all the schools that you are going to start should be on the same pattern, same sincerity.

And for Europe we have to give full credit to Gregoire. (Applause) Sending him to Me we must give all the credit to Rajesh Shah. (Applause)

He is also doing with his friend [Jahlal?] tremendous work in India to establish a very good school.

And for England we have to give full credit to Gavin Brown who has really - despite all kinds of problems - has stood up strong and fought all the negativity in that country. (Applause)

And for America we have to give full credit to Christine, who - though being a lady - has done such well. Slowly and steadily she has established Sahaja Yoga in America. And also in Canada, in a way. (Applause)

We have to think of many people like them and those who have been very helpful to Me, from the very beginning - like Mr. [Modi?] in Bombay. (Applause)

And Rustom in Riyad. (Applause)

Now, UK we have a joint leadership and we have really a very, very strong leader there, is Dr. David, who is doing tremendous work and he is helping Gavin in a very big way. (Applause)

In Switzerland we had Arneaux, who has. (Applause)

And in Spain we have Patrick now, who is doing very well, and he's brought these French round very well, I must say. (Applause)

But wisest of all is Guido from Italy. (Applause)

Who has come from Spain? So, please convey also to Spanish people that we have thought of our leader there, Jose. He is another very wise man.

This Austria is doing so well under the - I should say now - joint leadership of these two great people, who have organized all this and we really must admire the way everything is moving so smoothly, thanks to them. (Applause)

And Richard and Pat from Holland and Belgium.

And the most difficult one, Germany, by Hugo. (Applause)

The most formidable was started by Jamel and carried on by [Al Jahal?] in Algeria.

So one more, one more, but otherwise - there's Sierra Leone is another very great surprise to Me, beautiful surprise came from Sierra Leone, by Peter and Christine, both of them are here, very sweet lady, and they have been able to manage it so well in that farfetched country. (Applause)

And the most fantastic is from Nepal - Herbert and Lisa. (Applause)

South - in the - we can say - East and West we have two sides of America. And in Canada also we have two persons on two sides. And one is [Laury ?], another is Steve in Canada, and we have Dave on the west coast of America.

We have to think of all of them, because they are really the Adi Gurus for you. (Applause) Steve in Boston.

Adventurous were Peter and Rosalyn (?), who went to Hongkong to establish Sahaja Yoga there. (Applause)

(part 3 after music)

We have not been to Scandinavian countries and to Greece. And we have to somehow or another start going towards Greece as well as the Scandinavian countries, if possible. But that's rather a difficult case, let's see what happens. (Shri Mataji laughing)

So, if we have to think from countries point of view we have had really such great leaders to help, to guide, to nourish the Sahaja Yogis.

And I'm really thankful to them all for keeping their balance and attending to Sahaja Yoga work without asking for a single pai from Me.

And we have to know that we are not going to start priesthood in Sahaja Yoga, at any cost.

The work has to be done absolutely freely. Free, I mean, free and freely.

Otherwise we'll end up like another Christianity or something nonsensical like that.

So now, after all this you heard the description of yours that was found in some visions of these great poets. I would request you all to find out in your own languages, in your own countries there must be poets who must have described at length about Sahaja Yoga. Try to find out and we have to compile more and more of literature that announces the coming of Sahaja Yoga.

Also those who are making any poems or anything should be sent to your leaders first and then the leaders must sort it out and send it to Me. That is a much better idea, because sometimes, you see, people write all kinds of trash, nonsense, this that, they will send to Nirmala Yog. It's not proper. You must send it to the leader. Let the leader see. The leader can appoint two, three people who understand poetry, music and should scan it properly, establish it properly and then we should put it. Because we have to show that we are quite expert in everything.

Nothing should be done haphazard, but we have to be really methodical.

We have to be very organized and in a way very understandable for others. That's how people will be convinced that we are following Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

All right. Thank you very much! (Applause)

Music

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. That's a folk - innocent dance, the folk people so innocent. They dance so innocently expressing their joy for gratitude. Beautiful! Thank you very much! (Applause)
