Mahashivaratri Puja. Delhi (India), 14 March 1994.

It's a great pleasure that from all over the world people have gathered to worship Shiva. Actually we should say it is Sadashiva that we are going to worship today. As you know the difference between Sadashiva and Shri Shiva. Sadashiva is the God Almighty and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.

The combination between Sadashiva and the Primordial Mother Adi Shakti is just like a moon and the moonlight or the sun or the sunlight. We cannot understand such relationship in human being, among human marriages or among human relationships. So whatever the Adi Shakti's creating, which is the desire of Sadashiva, is being witnessed by Him. And when He is watching this creation He is witnessing all of it into all details. He witnesses the whole universe and He also witnesses this Mother Earth, all the creation that is done by the Adi Shakti. His power is of witnessing and the power of Adi Shakti is this all pervading power of love.

So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father we can say, expresses His desire, His Iccha Shakti as the Primordial Mother and She expresses Her power as love. So the relationship between the two is extremely understanding, very deep, and whatever She's creating, if She finds, if He finds there is some problem or there are people, human beings specially who are trying to obstruct Her work, or even the Gods who are not the deities are trying to express their egos, He is the one who brings forth their destruction. So He is the one who is responsible for the destructive power.

He is reflected in the hearts of human beings, among all the creations He pulsates. But that pulses, pulsation is the energy of the Primordial Mother. And He can destroy anything that goes against the plans of the Adi Shakti. Adi Shakti is love, She forgives and She loves. She loves her creation. She wants the creation to prosper, to go up to the same level for which it was created. She wants human beings to go to that level where they enter into the Kingdom of God, Kingdom of Sadashiva where there is bliss, there is forgiveness, there's joy.

All this is only possible if you have seeking, that you have also a innate desire to be there. This desire within us is reflected as the reflection of the Primordial Mother. Now this desire is there and other mundane desires are also there which stop the progress of your ascent.

In Sahaja Yoga we have never tried to overcome the desires by taking sanyasa or running away from the house or for all kinds of things that has been suggested. The first thing that is done is that you get the light of your Spirit. Spirit is the reflection of Sadashiva. In that light He shows, He is just showing the path. The spirit is just like a light which is burning and which is showing the path. In that path you yourself become so wise that you walk in the light of wisdom, that you walk in the light of righteousness, because whatever is destructive is seen through the light of your Spirit. You start giving up all that is destructive. Nobody has to tell you that: “Give up this, give up that.” You yourself realize that: “This is wrong and we should give up.” This was, I should say, my own understanding of human beings. Because these are the days where people are in complete illusions. They are in a conflict all the time struggling even to exist. Under these circumstances, everything would have failed if you had started with taking a sanyasa and then going to Himalayas and all that. 
If you have to do this for the masses, something has to be done radical and luckily I’ve been able to find out a way by which you can get your sprouting, your Realization.

Now some people who get Realization have to understand certain things because as you know there are many people who have got Realization. I don’t know how many, I don’t keep count. But what is lacking in them is surrendering. It’s embarrassing to say but is a fact. This is the only condition of modern Sahaja Yoga that you have to really surrender. If you start using your brain, if you start using other methods to understand Sahaja Yoga, you cannot. You must surrender and  - as Islam is nothing but surrender, Islam means surrender - and if that surrender is not there it is impossible to establish anyone in the Kingdom of God.

Surrender is not that you should give up your family, give up your children, or give up your houses and homes and your properties. Surrendering is here: give up your ego to begin with and then give up your conditionings. 
For example, the other day I met one gentleman and he is suffering a lot. So I asked him: “Who is your Guru?”, so he gave Me one name of a guru. I said: “He’s not done any good to you, will you give him up?” He said: “Tomorrow.” I said: “Why not today?” He said: “Today, but I have to throw away all his things. So tomorrow morning I will do it.” I said: “All right, do it.” “What should I throw away Mother?” I said: “Then all the things with which you worshipped him, throw away, throw away.” 
Then he went around the whole house, found out whatever was there which was used for worshipping him, everything he gathered together, threw in the sea. And then he told the sea that: “I am sorry. I have suffered a lot because of this man, now you please don’t suffer.”
So this kind of a very penetrating intelligence if you don’t have, you cannot give up. One sticks to that. 

I know of so many who find it so difficult to get rid of their conditionings. That’s more difficult than ego. Mundane conditionings and condition schemes that you have. We have first conditioning that supposing you are born in India or England or any place. After Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen most of the people they suddenly start seeing what’s wrong with their countrymen, what’s wrong with their country, what’s wrong with their religion, what’s wrong with the books they were reading. Immediately they start seeing it clearly, that this was the mistake, this is wrong. They all make fun of them. I’ve seen people all over the world. 

Nobody says that ‘No, no, no, no, because we are English we are the best, we are Russians so we are the best, or we are Indians we are the best’. Immediately they find out what’s wrong with them and why these people are not getting Realization.
On the other hand they feel such compassion that ‘Mother so many people haven’t got their Realization. Why shouldn’t we try to give them Realization?’ This is the double action of this light. Firstly you know that there is light and that you have become the light. So wherever your attention goes you start seeing the reality and then you understand that this has been the conditioning of our country, of our society. And then they abhor all that is wrong, they never identify with it.

But first thing as I said, is surrendering. In surrendering actually, you develop a kind of a state where I would say, you become a sanyasi from within. That means nothing can dominate you, what is a sanyasi is a person who is above everything else. Nothing can stick to him. He just, looks at things and he knows what it is. He may not say, he knows everything and he doesn’t do whatever is wrong. He’s so detached, that in that detachment only he can see what’s the problem. He starts seeing his family people, he starts seeing other surroundings, everywhere he starts seeing what’s wrong. And he does not identify with them, is very surprising.

I have seen it, I mean, I went to Turkey. In Turkey I met one gentleman who was running a big Swiss hotel and he came himself to Me and said Mother give me Realization. I was surprised because I didn't see this in Switzerland such a anxious personality would ask for Realization, very surprising that in Turkey he should ask for Realization. And I gave him Realization and immediately he said, "I am not going to go back to Switzerland." Just imagine!

It's, you see, it is so clear-cut that this light definitely gives you tremendous wisdom and balance. Supposing you are walking and you can't see the road, you may fall down. But if there's little light also you can see it. And this is what Sahaja Yoga has done, is given you very little light. That little light itself has been sufficient for you to give up so many things.

Now the other side of it is the ego part. Ego is very subtle stuff with human beings. I don't know how they gather it, but they do and some of them have such a gullible ego that with the slightest thing it shoots off. And they get very angry for small things or if they find somebody whom they can dominate, they can dominate also that person. Now this ego when you start seeing it, you just start laughing at yourself and think that, what's wrong with me.

Ego is not like conditioning which is coming from outside but ego is something that comes from within. It can come from anything. Human beings have ego of all kinds of nonsensical things. One day I met one lady and she was very proud and was not even smiling. I said, "What's the matter with this lady, what is she?" So they told Me, "She knows how to make dolls that's why she's so proud." I said, "Eh, to make dolls, she's so proud!" "Yes, you know, she can make dolls, so she's so proud." I said, "What is there, anybody can make dolls, so what is so great?" "No, but she thinks she is very great because she makes dolls."

So a man becomes stupid and stupid. That is first sign of a egoistical person. He is so stupid that when you are talking to him, you just get flabbergasted that without paying anything you have got a buffoon before you who is showing all joke, jokes of his buffoonery. Is, eh, something very surprising, I mean, you meet any egoistical person and you just watch him: "I did this, I am, I, I, I ..."

Then you start seeing the person, what's the matter, he's not even ashamed to say things that should not be said. Then it goes even to the sinful life they lead. They lead a very sinful life, they fond of women, they drink and this and that. Then they start boasting about that also: "I drank that day so much; I had five women around me." They start boasting of that also. So, for a egoistical man there is nothing like shame. He'll go on telling about his nonsensical things and everybody will say 'My God with whom are we talking?'

And then, whatever they do they justify. I asked one fellow, "You had such a bad heart attack why do you drink now, give up drinking." He said, "But even this person Kirloskar" - we have one in Poona who is now, I think, 95 - "he drinks". So I said, "You are not Kirloskar, and even if he drinks, what's the use, what is he gaining by that?" "No, no, you see he's very good, because, see, he drinks and he's so successful." "Is he successful without, because of drinking?"

But even ordinary reasoning is not there, ordinary reasoning. And in the general way if you see, even if you see the greatest drunkard countries, I have never seen a statue of a man who died of drinking, never. I've not seen in any country people are praising a man because he had ten women or he died of drinking. So far! I don't know how far human beings can go in their ego.

Now this ego is spreading very much in modern times where they start saying, "I like this, I don't like this". "What, what you don't like?" "I don't like this kind of a sari, I don't like this kind of clothes, I don't like this." But who are you, you are not going to see yourself, others are going to see. So what difference does it make whether you like it or not? But is very common with young people, to talk like that "I like." And this is a sign of complete destruction.

Because ego is not only, is, makes you stupid, you see all these days the way people dress up and we find they are very stupid because "I like it, so what?" Anything they like it, you know, if they want to walk on their heads "I like it, what's wrong?" All kinds of stupidity can be explained through ego. So those who get Realization somehow or other, thank God, see it: This is my ego talking. Then they start laughing at themselves, making fun of themselves: This was my ego.

But also in Sahaja Yoga there are people, I said, "Why don't you go and organize?" "Mother because my ego will come up." I said, "What's this?" "My ego will come up so I don't want to organize." How can your ego come up? If you see your ego, supposing you see, er, something is burning, you see it there. How can you get that burning onto yourself? But this is a very subtle type of, er, avoiding work of Sahaja Yoga to say that "No, I'll get into ego." I said, "All right you get into ego, I'll see to it, get in, what happens."

So all kinds of things there are which makes a person quite idiotic and stupid. I mean, I don't know how many things I can tell you today. But also I've seen in marriages this is very common. They'll say that, 'Mother, I married this girl at that time but now I don't think I should have been married.' Bah, bah, what, that time, what had happened to you, why didn't you marry at that time? I have to tell you these things because I've been facing all kinds of problems of this stupid, idiotic ego. One has to see it clearly, how this ego is working in me and how it is keeping me down.

So when we talk of ascent, we talk of a higher life. We have to become sanyasi like the lotus that comes out of the pond and no water can stay on them. Even the leaves of lotus, no water can stay on them. Just like that we have to become. We don't have to wear Sanyasis dresses, nothing of that. But from inside, a kind of a detached attention is there which immediately locates the problem, within you and without.

And also in Sahaja Yoga, you know how to overcome that. It's a very effective, efficient system. But for that again, to achieve that you have to become Shiva within, means detached. As Shiva is completely detached, you have to be detached. And that detachment will give you the same wisdom as Shiva has. Shiva sees, we should say, Sadashiva sees the work of Adi Shakti, silently. He doesn't get proud, he doesn't develop a kind of a ego 'Let me see now what my Iccha Shakti is doing', nothing, he's just watching. But when it comes to destruction, he sees that this part is going to destroy the work, immediately he destroys, removes that portion. In the same way we have to be, we have to see our life itself is a big field. How do we consider ourselves to be? I have seen people talk, "Oh, so what, I am a Sahaja Yogi!" You can't talk like that if you are a Sahaja Yogi. With folded hands you have to say, "I am a Sahaja Yogi". In your behavior, in your talk, in everything, you have to be a person who is extremely humble. If that is not so that means Sahaja Yoga has given you double ego. As it is you know that Shiva is known for his innocence, for his simplicity, his forgiveness. He forgives. He forgives rakshasas; he'll forgive everyone that is his quality. But anybody who goes against the Primordial Mother, he doesn't spare.

So this is his, the quality one has to understand, surrendering doesn't mean outside things to be surrendered. What is there, these are all stones, what are you surrendering? Surrendering means cleansing yourself completely, getting completely detached. Detachment is the only way you can rise. Some people get sick, they make such an ado out of it: "I am sick, the whole world should know I am sick, sick, sick, sick, sick." But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you just watch, how so, I am sick, all right, let's see. Just like a sport. Just watch. I am sick. So, what's happening now? The temperature is coming nicely, now is going down, just sort of a playful, mirthful attention. Ah, when I came I had temperature, but nobody believes I had temperature. I was so tired in the marriage they said, "You don't look tired." I said, "All right, I'm not tired." In the same way, life also is to be played. It's just a play, and that play has to be seen through the light of wisdom. Nothing is so serious, for Sahaja Yogis nothing is so serious. But he becomes very serious and he makes too much ado about himself.

There are lots of things which we have to learn. When we worship Shiva, we praise him. You are this you are that, you are that. When you worship Me also you praise Me, you are this. I am not aware of all that that you say. But you say all right, if you say so, it's all right. You are this you are that, the thousand names of Shiva, thousand name of the Goddess, thousand name of Vishnu. These are their names you are worshipping, what about you people, how many names you can have? Actually in the puja when you take the names of these Shaktis they also get awakened within, no doubt. After puja you do feel that way but you don't utilize them. So many people I've seen have come in the puja and they have got that power within themselves, same powers. But by the time they are out, it's finished, it's gone.

So, surrendering has another side: assumption. Assumption that I am a Sahaja Yogi and I can absorb all these powers within myself. So one side is surrendering. Why to surrender? To absorb. Automatically when you are surrendered you absorb. But once you have absorbed, then you should retain and assume within yourself, know that you have these powers. There, where Sahaja Yogis fail more. First time it happened, no Sahaja Yogi would touch anybody raise anybody's Kundalini, this thing, that thing. We had at least fifty Sahaja Yogis by then. I said, "Now what to do, I have prepared these channels and nobody is even raising their fingers. How am I going to work it out?" Very difficult!

But once it happened we had a program in Nasik Road and I was staying in Nasik. It's about, I think, thirty miles from there. So, we reached halfway and our car failed and nobody no other car was coming, nothing, no support, nothing. I didn't know what to do. But these, all the Sahaja Yogis had arrived there, and such a big crowd. They started saying, "When is Mataji coming? When is Mataji coming?" Such a pressure! So they said, "It's all right, we'll give you Realization, sit down." And they gave Realization. That's the first time the Sahaja Yogis started knowing that they can give Realization, they can do this, they can do that. They all started after that. So assumption should be there, that I have these powers, I am not going to waste them, I am going to use them, I am going to look after others, I am not going to just keep to myself. This assumption has to come.

Once I was traveling by ship and one fellow got caught up in the freeze room and he got pneumonia. So the captain came to Me ‘That see this boy has got pneumonia, we have to get some doctor by helicopter.’ I said, “Captain, I’ve given you Realization, you are a doctor.” He said “Who, I?” “Yes, you.” “If you want, I can go down.” “No, no, no, but tell me what to be done.” I said “Just go and put your hand on his heart, finished.” “I?” he said. “Yes, you!” Went down and put his hand and the fellow got all right. He was amazed. He met Me now in the wedding – and he was amazed at himself. “This I can do to anyone?” “Yes, yes, you can!” 
But if you do not assume, and just sit down meditating, meditating, surrendering … what’s the use? So, you have to do, now after achieving Shiva state you have to start doing the work of Adi Shakti. You should get this desire that we should spread Sahaja Yoga, we have to work it out. But be careful sometimes you might be conditioned, you might be egotistical, watch yourself. 
With watching you can, I’m sure, you can achieve a lot. We have done, some people who have taken it upon themselves have done it, everywhere, in every country.

So the first thing of surrendering is important to reach the state of your Spirit, of Shiva and Sadashiva. But the second state is that you have to now think of others. First it is as they say in Sanskrit is vyashti [success; individiality], means individual gain, you get the individual gain. And then it becomes samashti [attainment;collectiveness] , means the collective. 
You have to work it out on collective. People who never even got Realization, nothing of the kind, have been doing so much organization and this and that. While you have got it, so now it is important that you should now extend this light to others.
