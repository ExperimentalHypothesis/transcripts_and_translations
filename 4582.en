Navaratri Puja, New York (USA), 29 September 1981.

“It was so pre-planned today by the Divine, I should say, that today is a very great day. In the first advent of the Holy Ghost came on this Earth this day. That was about fourteen thousands years back. And today is the day that is celebrated as the first advent. And there are nine advents She has had, before She came as the Mahalakshmi. So first, today I will be telling you about it –how She is placed within us, where She resides, what is Her work, how She protects us. I will be today telling you on the Heart Chakra. And that’s why today they celebrate this special day of Her worship.

Now, today, as some of you are new people, I would just say that you don’t think too much about it. Try to receive more vibrations. Because when all these things are done only my centers start vibrating yours and opening your centers. That’s what happens.

And as you know, we have asked very few of you to come here because it is difficult for people to bare the vibrations if they are not fully prepared for it. And because of this preparation, we wanted to have some more time. But we have risked it this time.

I hope you’ll be able to bare the vibrations. They will open your centers, they’ll raise your Kundalini much higher, they’ll give you a much greater dimension and also powers. But one thing is there, don’t think about it. Keep your mind away so that you receive it more and understand it more.

We tried this experiment in Australia and just after Realization, within three days, so many people came not for the puja but for washing of my feet. And they got very well established in Sahaja Yoga. So it is one of the easiest way to grow. But it is to be understood, in the Western life it’s rather difficult to understand adoration, because now I am in form. I’ve came in form and you should make fully use of me. Get full advantage by exposing yourself to these powers so that they enter into your being and you are empowered much more. Alright? This is the idea. Now, this is a very secrete ceremony opened to very few Sahaja Yogis and it is done in India everywhere and we select people as I told you. Very few people are allowed to come in. Not all the people. But, as you know we had very little time, we could not sort of do that to you. So please don’t think about it, just be in thoughtless awareness and try to receive as much as you can. I would suggest those who have come for the first time should sit in front. So that it would be – please, come along. Tracy, have you attended any puja?

Tracy: The Wale [?] Mother.

Shri Mataji: You have, alright. Who else? Christine and you have not been to any puja. You both come forward. [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi with a Sahaja Yogi].

How many are there for the first time? Gavin? Please come, come, come forward, come forward. [Shri Mataji counts in Hindi]. Come along Barbara.

Sahaja Yogi: Nine.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogi: Nine.

Shri Mataji: Good number, nine days, nine people. It worked out. Somehow it worked out. Alright.

Sahaj Yogi: [Unclear]. Some more want to come.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear].

So while washing my feet, they will be reading the adoration of Shri Ganesh who is incarnated as Jesus Christ - alright? - who is embodiment of innocence. And that will be in English. Have you got that part?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: So that will be read. And I would like you to pay attention to what is - plus you have to wash my feet so that you receive your vibrations in a clear cut way.

I wish you could have read Hanumana also. That would have been better than this. Ah, is he coming? This Baptist gentleman?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

[Unclear, Betani ? will come].

Shri Mataji: Alright, bring that. That Baptist should come, you know, as you said that he should come, because-

Sahaja Yogi: We gave him the address.

Shri Mataji: It’s quite late now, look at this. What time you told him, ten o’clock?

Sahaja Yogi: Eleven.

Shri Mataji: Eleven. Come along, come forcward. Barbara, you also come here. Come to sit here, you see. You also.

Lady: What we’ll be doing here?

Shri Mataji: [Unclear]. Three o’clock they started, there are vibrations that’s coming out, tremendous. Ah, you’re almost there, can you feel it? Try to put your hands, alright?

Have you got Devi Purana? [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi with a Sahaja Yogi]. Marakandeya’s you don’t have, otherwise you could have read about Mahavishnu, about Jesus Christ, but it’s alright now.

[Shri Mataji is reading a book]

A lady: Is that book available?

Shri Mataji: Eh?

A lady: that book that you have in your hands?

Sahaja Yogi: Can you buy it here?

Sahaja Yogi: We certainly, we find if we can get it here.

Shri Mataji:. It’s Puranic. I don’t know, I have no idea if it’s available, but it is translated.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi with a Sahaja Yogi].

Sahaja Yogi: Devi Purana.

Shri Mataji: Ne, ne. Acha, doesn’t matter.

[MARATHI part].

This is, this is the book which he has got in English language, is the, is the praise of the Goddess, you see, of the Holy Ghost, you see, all that is there: how She was created, then how She get into forms, how She incarnated on this Earth, and how She killed these horrible people who were trying to, I may say we call them rakshasas or devils, we can say satanic forces, and all that is written in this book, but it is translated in that book, in the Devi Saptashati. And I do not know if you can get that book in America or not. But these people have got it, we have to find out that one.

Lady: I think Samuel Wiser in the village might be able to order it, if they don’t have in stock. They have all those things.

Shri Mataji: Yes, maybe. Because this is the, this is the happening much before. She actually came as a human being on this Earth. You see the first incarnation was of Sita, then of Radha, and then of Mother of Jesus. So She came, thrice She came as a human being, this is as Mahalakshmi. But this is the Mahakali, is the one which is the Primordial and that is. And then, out of that, these three powers came. Right?

Lady: And this is the next one after Mary?

Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

Lady: This is the next one after Mary?

Sahaja Yogi: Mahalakshmi.

Shri Mataji: Mahalakshmi.

Sahaja Yogi: Mahalakshmi was Mary.

Shri Mataji: Mahalakshmi. She has three powers. She is one is at Mahakali, with which She is the one who exists, and when She gets angry, She can kill also. That’s the point. That’s Mahakali. And from Her two other powers came out. Was Mahasaraswati, who is the creative power. And the third one is the evolutionary power, is Mahalakshmi. And Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi. She was born out of the water. That’s why She is called as Mary. Even in English language we call Her Mary, Mary words comes from marine, you see. And My name also, the first Neera means the one born out of water. It’s a very funny combination, everything if you see My whole name. Nirmala means immaculate. And Neela, I have two three names because they’re made short, and that’s how it has a different meaning. But in any case, when you get the book Advent, you might get lots of information. Also, we have a magazine, I don’t know if you have that.

Sahaja Yogi: We keep it downstairs.

Shri Mataji: Alright. So you also get that magazine from India, they will send it over to you. Alright? That we’ll all arrange. Now.

So, Gavin, please start.”
