Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - Reviewed

It was so pre-planned through the Divine, I should say, that today is a very great day, when the first advent of the Holy Ghost came on this Earth.
That was about fourteen thousand years back. And today is the day that is celebrated as the first advent. And there are nine advents She has had, before She came as the Mahalakshmi.
So first, today I will be telling you about it – how She is placed within us, where She resides, what is Her work, how She protects us, I will be today telling you on the Heart Chakra.
And that’s why today they celebrate this special day of Her worship.
Now, today, as some of you are new people, I would just say that you don’t think too much about it. Try to receive more vibrations.
Because when all these things are done, only my centers start vibrating yours and opening your centers. That’s what happens. And as you know, we have asked very few of you to come here, because it is difficult for people to bear the vibrations if they are not fully prepared for it.
And because of this preparation, we wanted to have some more time. But we have risked it this time.
I hope you’ll be able to bear the vibrations. They will open your centers, they’ll raise your Kundalini much higher, they’ll give you a much greater dimension and also powers.

But one thing is there, don’t think about it. Keep your mind away so that you receive it more and understand it more.
We tried this experiment in Australia and just after Realization, within three days, so many people came not for the puja but for washing of my feet. And they got very well established in Sahaja Yoga. So it is one of the easiest way to do it.
But it is to be understood, in the Western life it’s rather difficult to understand adoration, because now I am in form. I’ve come in form and you should make full use of me.
Get full advantage by exposing yourself to these powers so that they enter into your being and you are empowered much more.
Alright? This is the idea.
Now, this is a very secret ceremony opened to very few Sahaja Yogis. And it is done in India everywhere and we select people as I told you. Very few people are allowed to come in. Not all the people.
But, as you know we had very little time, we could not sort of do that to you.
So please don’t think about it, just be in thoughtless awareness and try to receive as much as you can.
I would suggest those who have come for the first time should sit in front. So that it would be – please, come along.
Tracy, have you attended any puja?
Tracy: Diwali (?), Mother.
Shri Mataji: You have, all right. All right. You come forward. Who else? Christine? And - you have not been to any puja. You both come forward. [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi with a Sahaja Yogi]. How many are there for the first time? Gavin? Please come, come, come forward, come forward. [Shri Mataji counts in Hindi]. Come along, Barbara.
Sahaja Yogi: Nine.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Sahaja Yogi: Nine.
Shri Mataji: Good number, nine days, nine people. It worked out. Somehow it worked out. Alright.
Sahaj Yogi: [Unclear]. Some more want to come.

Shri Mataji: They must wait for these people. Now, while washing my feet, they will be reading the adoration of Shri Ganesha who incarnated as Jesus Christ, alright? Who is the embodiment of innocence.
And that will be in English. Have you got that one?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: So that will be read. And I would like you to pay attention to what is – and plus you have to wash my feet so that you receive your vibrations in a clear-cut way.
I wish you could get Hanumana also. Would have been better than this. Ah, is he coming? This Baptist gentleman?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Gavin: This time he will come.
Yogini: Pardon?
Yogi: This time he will come. The Baptist.
Shri Mataji: Alright, bring that in, you know. That Baptist should come, you know, I would say that he should come, because...
Sahaja Yogi: We gave him the address, Mother.
Shri Mataji: It’s quite late now, eleven o’clock. What time you told him, ten o’clock?
Sahaja Yogi: Eleven.
Shri Mataji: Eleven. All right, that’s all right. Come along, come forward. Barbara, you also come here. Come sit here, you see. Yourself.
Lady: What we’ll be doing here?
Shri Mataji: Today’s tremendous vibrations. See, three o’clock they started, see vibrations that start coming in (unclear), tremendous. Ah, you’re almost done, can you feel it? Try to put your hands straight, alright?
Have you got Devi Purana? [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi with a Sahaja Yogi].
Markandeya’s you don’t have, otherwise you could have read about Mahavishnu, about Jesus Christ, but it’s all right now.
[Shri Mataji is reading a book]
A lady: Is that book available?
Shri Mataji: Eh?
A lady: That book is already available that you have in your hands?
Warren: Can you buy it here?
Gavin: I think we - we certainly - we’ve found it and you can get it in England, but that’s, that’s what.
Shri Mataji: Devi Purana it is. I don’t know, no idea if it’s available, but he can translate it.
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi with a Sahaja Yogi].
Gavin: Devi Purana.
Shri Mataji: Ne, ne. Acha, doesn’t matter.
[MARATHI part].
This is, this is the book which he has got in English language, is the, is the praise of the Goddess, you see, of the Holy Ghost, you see, all that is there: how She was created, then how She get into forms, how She incarnated on this Earth, and how She killed these horrible people who were trying to, I may say - we call them rakshasas, they are called devils, we can say, satanic forces, and all that is written in this book, but it is translated in that book, in the Devi Saptashati. And I do not know if you can get that book in America or not. But these people have got it, we’ll have to find out that one.
Lady: I think Samuel Wiser in the village might be able to order it, if they don’t have it in stock. They might have all those things.

Shri Mataji: Yes, maybe. Because this is the, this is the happening much before. She actually came as a human being on this Earth. You see, the first incarnation was of Sita, then of Radha, and then of Mother of Jesus. So She came, thrice She came as a human being, and this is as Mahalakshmi. But this is the Mahakali, is the one which is the Primordial and that is... (Aside: “Thank you”). And then, out of that, these three powers came in. All right?
Lady: And this is the next one after Mary?

Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?
Lady: This is the next one after Mary?
Warren: Mahalakshmi.
Shri Mataji: Mahalakshmi.
Warren: Mahalakshmi was Mary.
Shri Mataji: Mahalakshmi.
She has three powers. She is - one is that Mahakali, with which She is the one who exists, and when She gets angry, She can kill also. That’s the point. That’s Mahakali. And from Her two other powers came out. Was Mahasaraswati, who is the creative power.
And the third one is the evolutionary power, is Mahalakshmi. And Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi. She was born out of the water. That’s why She is called as Mary. Even in English language we call Her Mary, Mary word comes from marine, you see. And My name also, the first, Neera means the one who’s born out of water. It’s a very funny combination, everything if you see My whole name is. Nirmala means immaculate. And Neela, I have two-three names because they are made short, and that’s how it has a different meaning.
But in any case, when you get the book Advent, you might get lots of information.
Also, we have a magazine, I don’t know if you have that.
Gavin: I’ve put it downstairs, it’s not here, Mother.
Shri Mataji: All right. So you also get that magazine from India, they will send it over to you. Alright? That we’ll all arrange.
So, Gavin, should we start? Gavin, I think you should stand up and let Neema tell them how to do it. Yes.
Loudly.
Water of my feet can be used for your skin.
It’s very good for your skin problems. Or anything, like if you want to give it to your plants, kind of thing. They use it in India, they have used it in that Agricultural University, and it has worked wonders. Because it gets completely vibrated, that water.
[Aside in Indian language] Let Neema come down there. She has to tell them how to do it.
At a time two persons can wash, all right?

So, yes. [Aside in Indian language]
[Recitation of mantras by Gavin begins]
Shri Mataji: We are awakening all the Goddesses, Gods, you see, and especially the twenty-one aspects of our evolution. Twenty-one aspects of our evolution, that he is awakening now.
There are twenty-one aspects in our evolution which are to be worked out. This is the machinery he is working it out.
[Recitation of mantras by Gavin continues]
Gavin: So we do this puja on behalf of all the sahaja yogis of all the centers of Sahaja Yoga around the world, on the 29th day of September, in the Autumn season, on the first night of Navaratri. According to all religious scriptures, all of us, with all our families, pray for well-being and for spiritual well-being. For victory, fearlessness, longevity, health, wealth, and for nullification of all badhas of the sahaja yogis.

To become the masters of eight siddhis, to give peace to all, on two legs and on four legs.
We pray for health, satisfaction, and for all auspiciousness. For all those who are handicapped, for the emancipation of all people, to give them the highest knowledge.
And whatever are our powers, whatever is our knowledge, whatever offerings we could get through meditation or by whatever means of different types, these we surrender in the puja.
Shri Mataji: Now, one point I would like to say. Now yesterday a person raised the question that actually, the Brahma, the God’s Divine power is all-pervading everywhere.
Unless and until you get realized you cannot feel it, you see. After realization what happens that your centers are awakened within, and without here too. And then you start feeling it.
See, this cool breeze is existing everywhere. But you don’t feel it, because you are not awakened. And once you are awakened you start feeling that Brahma, that all-pervading Divine power. All right?
And that is the power of God Almighty which is represented in us or reflected within us, as the Spirit. And once the Kundalini touches the Spirit, your chakras get enlightened. And because of that enlightenment, you start feeling that all-pervading power which is everywhere.
Which exists, but it’s not there, unless and until there is enlightenment you cannot feel it.
So to feel the cool breeze means you are awakened, you are realized. That means your chakras are awakened, do you understand my importance? And you will see that how it absolutely acts, so clearly.
Lady: It was very cold over here, I feel very cold on my hands now.
Shri Mataji: Yes, just now it is very powerful. You see? And now after washing my hands you’ll feel more, now see yourself.
(Aside) Much more, much more, it improves, all right, come along. And after the puja we’ll be blasted, with these vibrations. All right. Now, come along. Who else? Now come along. You first. Come along... all right, now.
Gavin: Now also to the seat of the Mother, to the water jar, the conch and the bell...

Shri Mataji: The puja things which are auspicious. (23.18)
Gavin: ... we do puja to all of them. We request all the rivers to cleanse our bodies...

Shri Mataji: Did you say what river is here? You must say what is the river. Eh?
Yogi: Hudson river.
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: Hudson.
Shri Mataji: Did you say Hudson river?
Gavin: No, I didn’t mention it.
Shri Mataji: Hudson river. And in New York?
Lady: East River. It’s a junction of the Hudson River and the East River.
Shri Mataji: All right. And the sea itself!
Lady: And the sea itself.
Shri Mataji: And the seashore.
(Aside: Rub, rub, because it has to be hard. And nothing happens to you. I’m very straightforward (20.47-23.56) Rub it, rub it like that. All right. With care)
Gavin: Above all we worship Mahaganapati, and request Him to continue this puja without any hindrance.
Shri Mataji: So you have to take the help of Shri Ganesh that there should be no hindrance.
Gavin: Shall I read the twenty-one names of Lord Vishnu, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Now these are the twenty-one aspects of the evolutionary power within us.
Gavin: Om Keshavaya Namaha. Means: Having all the powers. Controlling the Trimurtis. Illuminating all.
Om Narayana Namaha. The cause of all.

Shri Mataji: Shri Krishna is the complete formation of the evolutionary power. It’s the complete, Shri Krishna. It’s the complete form. Means we are dealing now only with the evolutionary power. By which you raise is the Kundalini, is the evolutionary power.

Now, this is the worship of Shri Ganesha.
Gavin: Yes. Last thing before...
Shri Mataji: Is the worship of Shri Ganesha, who is the embodiment of innocence within us. Who is Jesus Christ, at Agnya. Now you see the completeness of it, how He is described. We have no idea about Jesus Christ, what He is. No idea what powerful thing He is, we have nothing.
But in the Puranas He is described at length. Absolutely. Now this is a short form.

Gavin: So first we will make a formal invitation to the Goddess to be present for our puja.

To the Goddess who has all the thousand Purushas in Her, who has a thousand eyes, who has a thousand powers, I request You, I invite You very humbly, to be present for this occasion of the puja.
Warren: “Let our ears hear that which is true; let our eyes see that which is pure; let our beings praise that which is divine; and let those who listen hear not my voice but the wisdom of God.
Let us worship with the same song...”.

Shri Mataji: This is a song written about I don’t know how many thousands years back.
Warren: “Let us worship with the same song, the same strength and the same knowledge; and let our meditation enlighten and enrich. Let there be amongst us compassion and peace.
Now the prayer:
Salutation Shrī Ganesh, sākshāt Shrī Jesus Sākshāt Shrī Nirmalā Devi namo namah.”
Shri Mataji: Sakshat means person.
Sahaja Yogi: “It is You who is the beginning of all the beginnings. It is You who is the doer of all deeds which have been done, are being done, and will be done. It is You who supports all things that are supported. It is You who protects all things that are protected. It is You who is the complete, all-pervading Spirit, God’s divine energy. Think clearly brain; speak only the truth.
Let Your presence in us speak;
let Your presence in us listen;
let Your presence in us bless;
let Your presence in us protect;
let Your presence in us, Your disciples, be the disciple.
You are all literature, and the ability to understand the literature”.
Shri Mataji: The abstract (? Unclear 31.15)
Sahaja Yogi: You are the divine combination of complete truth, complete happiness and complete energy; and You are more. You are all the knowledge, and You are the use to which the knowledge is put. You exist until the end of all things, and, after the end of all things, You are.
You create the end of all things, and, after the end of all things, You remain indifferent.
You are the earth, You are the water, You are the fire, You are the air, and You are the space above the air. You are the gunas and You are beyond the gunas. You are the body and You are beyond the body. You are the essence of time and You are beyond time. You and only You exist at the Muladhara chakra. You are the Spirit and You are beyond the Spirit; and those who would join God meditate upon You. You are Brahman, Vishnu, Rudra; You are Indra, Agni, Vayu;
You are the sun at noon, You are the full moon; through all these and more, You are the all-pervading energy of innocence and wisdom. You are the divine servant who stoops to wash the feet of saints...”
Shri Mataji: See now. See, wash the feet of saints is described thousands of years back. Come along.
Lady: Does it have anything to do with Christ saying washing each other’s feet?

Shri Mataji: Eh?
Lady: When Christ has washed each other’s feet, is that washing?
Shri Mataji: No, no. He washes the feet of the disciples, that is His quality, you see? The humility.
Yogi: “You are the divine servant who stoops to wash the feet of saints”.
Shri Mataji: You see? This was written thousands of years back.
Yogi: Talking of Lord Ganesha.
Shri Mataji: And the same Christ does.
Yogi: “You are the tiny core of all things, without which the larger have no purpose;
You are the key to the libraries of all the scriptures, without which the truth is hidden; You are the full stop which completes the sentence, and without which the sentence loses its meaning. You are the crescent moon, You are the stars and You are beyond the stars; all things, from tiny dot to universe, is You. You are in the future and beyond the future; You are in all forms; You are where the sounds combine; You are the silence between the sounds; You are the rhythm of all music and all prayers. This is the knowledge of Nirmal Ganesh, and You, Nirmal Ganesh, are the master of that knowledge, and all knowledge. You are the God and You are the Goddess.
Aum Gam Nirmal Ganapataye.
To Your powers, Ganesha, let all surrender; let the left side of memory and the right side of action surrender to You and let Your enlightenment prevail.
Your first tooth You have, and four hands: one holding a rope, the second a goad, the third is raised in blessing and the fourth offers sustenance. Your banner is that of a humble mouse. You have long ears and are clothed in red; red decorates You and You are worshipped with red flowers. You have compassion for those who love You, and it is for those who love You that You come to this Earth. You are the force that creates, the energy that pervades and the Spirit that protects. Those who seek union with God pray through You; those who seek union with God worship You.
Aum Gam Nirmal Jesusye
To Your powers, Aum Jesus, let all surrender; let the left side of memory and the right side of action surrender to You and let Your enlightenment prevail.
You are the Word that was the beginning...”
Shri Mataji: Alpha and Omega.
Yogi: ... You are the Word that will be the ending. You are He who was born of a Virgin, and died on the cross; You are He who absorbs all sins, and who died to live again; You are God in man, and You are worshipped with red flowers.
You have compassion for those who love You, and it is for those who love You that You come to this Earth. You are the force that creates, the energy that pervades and the Spirit that protects. Those who seek union with God pray through You; those who seek union with God worship You.
Shri Ganesha, salutation to You.
Shri Jesus, salutation to You.
He who is the beginning of all worship, salutation to You. He who destroys all the powers of evil, salutation to You.
Sākshāt son of Lord Shiva, who is unending blessings, salutation to You.
Sākshāt son of Mary Mātājī, who is unending love, salutation to You.
Sākshāt Mātājī Nirmalā Devī, who is unending joy, salutation to You.”
[Aside to the people coming to wash Her feet: “May God bless you. See the vibrations now, you just see”]
... What time you have to leave?
Yogi: Mother, at least at one o’clock. We should leave at one o’ clock.
Shri Mataji: You leave at one. It will take one hour to go there. What time you have to reach?
Yogi: A quarter – one hour quarter, maybe quarter to one. Quarter to one, the plane is taking off at three o’ clock.
Shri Mataji: All this is how, if you leave at one o’ clock it will be all right. All right? So. We’ll just – how many names would you like to have?
Gavin: We do hundred and eight names? We do the hundred and eight names.
Shri Mataji: Thousand names can we take? Only today, it’s first day, we must take thousand.

Gavin: If we don’t give the translation, we can do it then.
Shri Mataji: You don’t have the English?
Gavin: Yes, but I can do it with just the names, without the translation.
Shri Mataji: It’s not there.
Gavin: Yes, you can.
Warren: It would take less time without the translation.
Gavin: If we don’t translate.
Shri Mataji: Yes. Do it in English.
Gavin: No, in English it would be much slower.

Shri Mataji: No, but better do it in English otherwise they won’t listen (unclear). We are lazy. Because they won’t understand otherwise, isn’t it? In Sanskrit language. It will work, but they should understand everything. It works better.
Lady: I think it should be done in English.
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Lady: I think it should be done in English.
Shri Mataji: Indeed. All of them. (She laughs) You should understand it. So, it’s not a mental activity, you see? These are mantras, which work out in your chakras. It’s not a mental activity. You can translate it, it’s much longer than the mantra itself, but it’s better. These are the thousand powers of the Goddess, is the names of the Goddess, all right? So, will we start?
