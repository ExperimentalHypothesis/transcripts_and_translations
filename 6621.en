Public Program. Caxton Hall, London (UK), 9 June 1980.


(The other) day in the ashram, I was telling you about our subtleties, the subtleties we have already within us which we do not understand. Could be from our sub-conscious mind, could be from our supra-conscious mind, could be from anywhere that is unknown to us; but the subtleties that lead us to our universal being is the one we should bother about. 


We have sometimes heard about people who get a hunch. Like somebody says, "I must buy this house, I get a hunch that I should buy it." Or sometimes people say that, "I always hear something, somebody tells me that this should not be done." But all such suggestions must be judged that they come to you to tell you about something of the beyond or something that concerns the mundane life, like buying a house.


God is not interested in what house you buy or how much money you are making, He's not. It's not important to God. One can understand, that isn't it? Also that God is not interested in telling you against someone in the ear that, "Beware of this man, he's a dangerous guy." What if somebody is going to harm you physically? Maybe, to some part, we can say that God wants to preserve your body. But this body is also not so important to God because He can create it again.


The most important thing that God has to give us is His love, His connection with us, His kingdom, His powers. So the subtleties which we should really accept within us should be which takes you to the realm of joy, to the realm of collectivity. 


Like suddenly you see a little child weeping on the street. You feel your heart is weeping, not that you feel guilty about it but you feel one with the child and you feel you are the... Then definitely that subtlety of compassion that is God, is felt. But you don't feel guilty about it and you don't give him two p's or something to insult his ego. You do something very constructive about it, extremely constructive and you do it secretly; you don't like to tell anybody about it because you think it is vulgar to talk about your compassion. You do it so sweetly that the other fellow doesn't feel it. The whole act is such a beautifying thing. You don't announce it in the paper and you don't publish it in Who's Who or you do not go for a Nobel Prize or something. This is all very vulgar for the subtle thing that you worship within yourself, because that element within you is so much higher than all these gross considerations that you just care for that. 


That is what God is. That's how God shines within us. Even before our realization, before our connection with God, He shines in some people even before they have been realized. You see that; they're quiet people. They're not show-offs. But they're very sincere, extremely kind-hearted. Such people when they face Sahaja Yoga, immediately they get their vibrations. They're not people who are worried about money, or they're worried about the gross things of life or achievements that are so stupid. Such people may exist as very ordinary people; they need not be at the helm of affairs, mostly they're not; because they're not ambitious. They do not want much success in life; they don't see any point in being very successful. They might be something very ordinary; they might be something, doing something very important also. 


But in their lives, those who come in contact with them remember that, yes, there was a life or there is a life, definitely there's a spark. Because such a person being so subtle does not assert. Such a person cannot be very dominating, assertive, argumentative; such a person is quieter, his attention recedes from all quarrels and all squabbles of life. But such a person has a great position in the domain of God. That you've seen how in Sahaja Yoga suddenly you find people manifesting their divinity. Maybe such a person is too na√Øve for all practical purposes. He might have been cheated, might have been misled by some horrible people who try to exploit his seeking but still it remains. This element suddenly gets ignited in Sahaja Yoga and for such a person, this is the most important thing is to feel that being which always kept him away from all the rest of the ideologies and greetings and have always given him strength and confidence and joy. He sees that clearly in Sahaj Yog; he adheres to it and when he nourishes it, he's amazed that he has found himself. Then it becomes his life. 


There are thousands and thousands of people, everywhere. I say thousands, I don't say millions, I'm sorry, because they are not in millions, I'm sorry for that, I wish they were.  They could be counted in thousands, maybe twenty one thousand altogether, of that quality.  There won't be millions but they'll be making millions later on.  There has to be few.  These are people of special calibre, as I've said.  But it is necessary that everybody must be given self-realization, every seed must be germinated, but how many would sprout into the trees and would render fruit is a different point altogether.  First and foremost thing is that first let them all be germinated. In due course, all those who'd come back, but some would prosper into their complete manifestation in their full bloom in a very short time and that's what matters the most.  


The Divine is not interested in useless people, it is interested in that special calibre. As I've told you, such a person may not be at all rich, maybe absolutely poor. That doesn't mean that rich cannot be so, can be very rich also. The outward appearances and status and all these denominations do not matter. I'm talking of the spark inside; they can be called as gentlemen, in simple words, or the . A serene dignity manifests through their being. Sometimes it happens with their lives also, that they find it very difficult to keep to the norms of the mad world and they may be little cynical, sometimes, could be.  But cynicism is not that subtlety, but they may appear to people little cynical, but they have to be very delightful and extremely cheerful people. They cannot be morose, sad, emitting unhappiness all around, and big bores with a B capital and O capital, R and E, all capital. That cannot be possible. They're extremely enjoyable and magnetic and dynamic. They're complete in themselves, because they feel their subtlety, they live on that. Still, their seeking is there, and the meaning they try to find to their own being. And they want to identify their subtlety with something that is universal.


In their expression in any field that they are, they appeal to the universal being within everyone of us. Maybe, and they may not get a Nobel Prize, but a personality that appears that, emits that kind of congenial behavior. Now if somebody is a person who is absolutely satanic, will abhor such a person, possibly, but this does not concern to the subtler being because he is at a level which is not tarnished by gross attacks.


That is what one has to recognise in oneself and one should feel very proud and fortunate that, that exists within us. No more one has to feel lonely, because now we are so many of us, of the same creed and the same type. And so many of us who have found out, what is the reason, what expresses it, what manifests it within us. What are the deities that govern this subtlety within us, what you may call the archetype images; which archetype images are there which are real, not imaginary, within us. And all these discoveries, that makes you feel confident of all these great subtleties you've been enjoying so far.


Long time back, I had given a simile like this: that a mother bird puts the little child, or you can call, the baby bird, away from her. And the baby bird feels the mother's warmth, and she wants that. And she's calling for the mother. That calling itself is the last thing it knows of. That's the highest thing for the baby bird, nothing else matters. You may give anything to the baby bird, it won't be happy, it needs that; it needs that warmth, that love.  And then it expresses itself by spreading its tiny little wings around and tries to hop and to express it. And then out of complete joy of its hopping, the mother bird herself comes down and engulfs that child into the wings, giving all the warmth necessary.


It is that happening within us, which takes place within us when the Kundalini rises. The Kundalini is the part of that warmth within us, of that compassion; it's a part of that beauty, it's the part of that desire. Desire, what's the matter, the door is open or not, come in, come in. They're waiting because they think, what's the matter. It's all right. 


So the desire of God is placed within us as Kundalini. And when the, all the external desires dim out within us, and the real desire to be one with the Almighty remains, the Kundalini can rise spontaneously. That has happened to few people, very few people; you can say like Buddha, Mahavira. These people were human beings and they achieved godliness, not by forcing yourself to get rid of your desires. But through wisdom, understanding that, this is stupidity, this is foolishness. Where am I going? Just the wisdom acting, not a rational understanding. But the being itself projecting. First thing is our achievement through one's own evolutionary forces, also, there are so many other happenings, or we can say, the other supports, which bring forth this kind of spontaneous rising of the Kundalini.


There is somebody who wants to come and see me because he said, "Mother you are an authority on Kundalini and there are many books written about Kundalini, and I have to write a criticism, that the Kundalini when she rises, you start jumping; when she rises she gives you heat, or you burn off yourself  or you jump through the roof or something like that."  All sorts of horrifying things; nobody wants to listen to anything about Kundalini.  If you read those books, you'll be really frightened.  I think it is absolutely satanic.  And he wants to know about the authentic description of Kundalini. I told him that these books are all of them should be thrown away into the sea, because they're written by people who have had no experience of Kundalini awakening. Because they were people who must have been doing some sort of an adventure somewhere. 


Like some people believe that even finding of God is another job. If you've no job, better find God, at least He might tell me to survive. Some people do believe that instead of sitting idle, why not try to find God, would be good idea. And when such a thing happens and they venture into the search of God then first they're hit by the God of holiness. Because they're not entitled, they're not holy, they have no protocol about God Almighty, they have no respect, they're just doing it because they are ego oriented, they want to have another ego trip and they want to become great explorers of Kundalini. 


You cannot do it; you have to have proper protocol. They lack all humility, all holiness, righteousness and all that is needed to ask the help of the Kundalini. And they're hit by the first deity, which sits in the triangular bone, this they can also see sometimes, they have seen him, with a temper, in red colour, they call it or maybe in orange colour. Let him come, somebody's waiting there.


This deity is a very powerful deity, and it is the wisest deity, because it is the deity which gives us wisdom. You need not argue with the gentleman, it knows you out and out, it knows every bit of you. If you tell some story, it would say, "All right, I've heard all this story before, now will you please keep to yourself." It understands how genuine you are, how truthful you are. And this deity is the one with has given these bad experiences to these Kundalini seekers and writers of Kundalini.


It's a sad thing that a thief comes to the town and is caught up by the police, is put in the jail, and when he goes back to the village, he tells them, "Oh God, terrible, never go to the city; they catch hold of you, put you in the jail, don't give you food to eat, and then you cannot meet anyone for three years, and then they send you back." And everybody is frightened of going to the city. It is like that. 


Or the thief who goes to the bank from the backdoor, or sometimes they dig a tunnel or something like that, you see, great people in this world, you know, they have time to do all kinds of nonsensical things, to dig a tunnel to get some gold pieces, or something and dig aother tunnel to go to the jail directly. So these stupid people, when they try to do all these gross things, like going to a bank through the backdoor and are caught up. If you go and ask them their experiences, they'll say, "Oh horrible experience, never go near the bank, you don't put your money there, no, not at all." You ask them, "Why, what's the matter?"  They'll say, "Oh, they'll catch hold of you, you know, terrible people in that bank." 


They could even go further with it to warn you. If they're cunning, they may come by the front door and tell you, "Why go and put money in the bank, you give it to me, I can look after it better. It's better idea and if you want, I can you to twenty percent more than the bank does." And if you trust their cunning faces, you just hand over the money and you're lost and the bank is lost to you. And then you may say that, "What is this bank?"  In front of the bank there are people standing like this. What are these religions after all, what are these gurus in the name of God, standing in front door trying to rob others.  What sort of a God is this? So you start blaming the bank for the thieves who have cheated you. You must learn to separate both. 


This discretion is important even when you try to know about Kundalini, that Kundalini is the desire of God to bestow upon you His kingdom. The prince has to become the king. And such a beautiful desire, cannot be gross, cannot be ugly, cannot be painful, cannot be troublesome, cannot be hedious and serious. Once you understand this, then you will respect your Kundalini. She's your Mother, because She's going to give you your second birth and She has been with you for ages in so many lives, just waiting for this great time when She's going to give you your realization.


I'm telling you this because I know how beautiful She is. So many have really tortured Her, have frozen Her, made Her into a stone by cursing Her, but still She's breathing feebly with a hope that the day will come when She may be able to give you what She has been living for. 


This is Kundalini; this is Kundalini awakening. We have to give up our gross understanding of Kundalini. Like you would see in Sahaja Yoga when you'll be coming, you have seen it all your life and you'll see it more that so many of them just come to Me for getting all right in health, only for that. "I've got a back pain, I've got a stomach trouble, I've got arthritis," or, "I've got diabetes," there's nothing that is not there, "and I'm sure you'll cure me."


It's quite a queer situation because the request that I should cure is all right, but what is the right for this request? Why do you want that Divine should cure you? For what, for what purpose? If Divine has to only cure people, it would open lots of hospitals and get some Nobel Prizes, something. But it is not the desire of Divine is go on to just cure people who are just good for nothing, useless, absolutely useless, thoroughly wasted. Why should it work, it has intelligence, it has wisdom. Is it going to waste its energy on curing people who are good for nothing, useless? Are you going to clean this lamp if you cannot put any light in it? If you have no utility in the Divine sense, why should Divine cure you?


So all those who believe, "Oh Mother, you must cure people and that you should cure people," must know that all this is the work of Kundalini when She rises. She nourishes you, She cleanses you, because in this being of yours, God Himself is going to manifest. Because this temple of your body is to be cleansed, because God has to enter into it. That's why the Divine respects you as truth and helps you. Even it may help your, let's say, mother is there and her child is not all right, she's worried, so the Divine may cure the child, just to give peace to the mother, who is going to manifest God's power. Because God's power is the integrated power of all the powers. 


You can see here, on the left hand side, all the desires are manifested, the power of desire. That means all the desires you have can be fulfilled and blessed by this power. Can you believe it? It has the power to fulfill all your desires, but after realization, not before that. And after realization, your priorities change and your desires become different. Then you do not ask for money or for children, or something like that but you start asking for something of very eternal nature. The priorities change. You start seeing your desire in a different aspect because light has come. For example, in the darkness when you're walking, you find that there's a big black bank in front of you, you can't walk, so you desire, "Oh this bank should be removed." But when the light comes in you find there's no bank, nothing, it is all open for you. So your desire is that you should be able to see everything. The whole priority changes. So this left side has the power to fulfill all your desires. And the right side, where you see this yellow line, which looks so slender, has the power to act, to fulfill all your desires and the desires of God.


Here I'll take you little subtler. What are these acting powers? Tremendous. For example, this side is manifesting all the five elements. All the five elements await your asking. See this fire? You ask this fire, "Take away my problems," it takes away. You have seen it, water element, you go to the sea, and just go and stand in the sea, after realization, you find the whole thing is sucked in. The Mother Earth sucks all your problems. It's so fantastic. 


I was in Kuala Lumpur, you may write to him and find out, he was the speaker of the assembly, at his residence, and there were at least thousand people. And sixty percent were sick, and forty were attending to them. I was alone, no Sahaja Yogis, nothing. Luckily, they had a big garden, and it was quite warm day. I said, "All right, let's go in the garden." I made them sit in the garden and I asked the Mother Earth, I said, "You better now do the job and I'm sitting down." And everybody started feeling better. One thing I've never before seen being cured was, what you call this, what you call in English language, polio, and a little boy, about eight years of age was sitting on the ground, his parents had brought him on the back and put him down. He just got up and started walking, and the parents suddenly realized he's missing, "Where's he gone?" And he was running in the garden. It's a fact. Some blind started seeing things, it's most remarkable. You may write to him, I'll give you his address. It's a fact, it happened. And for everyone the whole miracle was so simple that they took it for granted, they didn't find that there was anything so fantastic, you see, after all Mother is here, so it has to work out. They did not rationalise it or anything, took it for granted. And even today, if I go there this may happen.


All the elements are waiting for your orders. So the great angels on the left hand side communicate to the right hand side angels; all the angels of the world, though it may sound fantastic to many, but they exist. You have to just ask their help. That is what is a mantra, is the awakened calling, or you can say, calling which has meaning. For example, a policeman blows his whistle, it has a meaning but anybody else starts whistling, people will put him in the jail. In the same way, the mantra is the authority which is applied with the word. And with this you can awaken all these forces within you, they're so tremendous that I'll take at least seven lectures to describe, which I'll describe some time, of which you are aware already, most of you. How they work and how they help you. Even we take them for granted, Sahaja Yogis. 


Because if you notice in life has one great mystery, I don't know if you're aware of that mystery, that whatever fantastic we get, somehow or other, we get it in such a way that we take it for granted. It's very sweet, isn't it? Supposing everytime we get a shock or we get frightened, we said, "Oh God," we would become neurotic, or funny people. But the way it settles down within us like a leaf falling from the tree drying out and just touches the ground softly and the ground also takes it for granted. In the same way, all these we take for granted. For example, our eyes, our nose, our forehead, everything we take for granted, our human bearing, everything we take it for granted, in the same way take even Sahaj Yog for granted, and that's the best way. 

But do we take it for granted, the way we take our being for granted, is the question. For example, we take it for granted our hand, all right, so if I have to lift my purse, I lift my hand, like this. When we take Sahaja Yoga for granted, do we use our vibrations for everything because now in our vibratory awareness, if we have taken it for granted, we should completely stand in it and work it out, I mean, I work that way. 


To Me everything is nothing but vibrations; everything I do is nothing but vibrations, all my movements and everything is nothing but vibrations. I take for granted Myself very well, I wish you could take for granted all that within you, the way we take for granted. Say, I give you a television and you just take it and you put it to the mains and you see the thing, you do not jump and say, "Oh God, look at the miracle, imagine!" Nothing, you just take it for granted. Anything, computer or any marvellous thing that you see, you take it for granted. In the same way, maybe in the beginning one feels, "How is it possible?" One may start thinking like that for a while; too much thinking is also not good, because then you're not take it for granted. But afterwards, you must use it left and right, just try, you're empowered. Now your television is open, it has started working. You are a great instrument and created thousands of years with such care. You do not know what forces have been used, how delicately and how dynamically. You have no idea as to how all the stars and all the heavens are moved up and down to create this beautiful being that is the human personality, you've no idea of that. And now when Sahaj Yoga takes place also, you must know that Sahaj Yoga's working has been worked out in the very dynamic manner. 


There are tremendous subtle forces which are working it out; you cannot make your Kundalini pulsate without something special happening there, just think of a remote control that works out your Kundalini, just think of it. There must be a tremendous mechanism. Why I say, take it for granted, because if you try first to open all your remote control and see for yourself and then breaking all of them, you start starting your television, you'll find the whole thing is finished, you have a headache, don't want to see anything. That's what happens to Sahaj Yogis, specially in the West, because as soon as they get their realization they go home and make a nice mess of themselves by thinking about it. They didn't get realization by thinking, it's a simple thing. And then they go back and then after seven months they come back, say, "Mother I have been to you seven months back, now I think I was wrong." So I say, "Why you say seven months?"


Today I hope you all will feel our subtleties flowering. Let us take ourselves down, those subtle points which we respect and the Kundalini will nourish the attention. Wherever your attention goes now, this attention is enlightened.


Today I received a letter from Australia, somebody had written, "Mother, we had sent you a picture of someone, husband and wife, and they're better since you gave them bandhan." And they were very serious faces, they're really better. But I did nothing, really I don't do anything. I just looked at the photograph, that's all. I didn't even give bandhan, you know, to be very frank. I just looked at it, that's all. I didn't think, I just looked at it, and it worked. Really I don't do anything, people thank me for nothing at all, you know. When you don't do anything and people thank you, you don't know what to say, "Thank you for thanking me."


Thank you for being here and we'll have some meditation. I hope you'll catch some deeper stratas within yourself.


May God bless you.


You've come for the first time, both of you? You been once before, what about you? First time? Are you feeling the cool breeze? All right, so you haven't lost it. What about you, are you feeling the cool breeze in the hands, not yet? All right, it will work out, it will work out. What about you? Are you feeling the cool breeze? No? How are you? Good, good, good. Are you all right? Good. What about you? You are thinking! Now, please, please!


See, thinking stops it. How? Between the two thoughts, for example, a thought rises and falls off, and another thought rises and falls off, between these two thoughts there is a little gap, that gap has expanded. For example, the thought that was, is the past and that is going to come is the future. In between is the space called as vilamb. And when you start thinking about it you jump onto the cusp of these thoughts. You're beyond thought. An Indian will understand it faster, because it's called as Nirvichar Samadhi. It's a state where you become thoughtlessly aware. They know that that's what it is. You cannot think about it, because rationality is a limited thing. So you have to jump into the space. When you are in the space then you are not in the capsule. But if you're in the capsule you're not in the space.


Better now, see how it works. Even your problems, I mean, I've given big lectures on this, how to solve your problems, in your thoughtless awareness. That's the mouth, that's the mouth where you have to put the problem in, and it works in your thoughtless awareness. It's the most precious thing, is to keep it up.

Are you getting now cool breeze? What about you, not yet? Now watch me here, are you thinking? All right, you watch me without thinking, that's another way you can do it. My face is such a funny thing that if you watch it for long time, you'll have no thoughts. Just it is something very funny. Today it happened, I went to the tailor and he just looked at me and he didn't... My husband said, "Is he stunned or what happened?"


Now watch me, without thinking. Better? This is the face, you need it. What am I to do? This is the problem with me, I don't know how to explain myself. . How are you now? Better? Everyday you'll be better and better and better. How are you? . That means you're going down a little, all right. So now keep it up. See, it is like a washing machine, goes round and round, a little bit, for cleansing, all right? They call it Maha Maya, we call it the great illusion, Mother is a great illusion, because She puts her people in illusion, I do not, you know we used to tell God, "Lead us not into temptation." Now why will He take you to temptation, but you do go, so you tell God that you keep us away from that, that's all you tell God, that you keep us away from thinking, it works. Better?


Your face looks different immediately. But you must come every Monday, see how , how many people they are giving realization to, all right? You must come, this is the most pleasurable thing, you don't know. It is little bit you have to develop the taste. Because you're used to the gross stuff, you see. Like somebody who is used to wine cannot give up but once the wine from within starts pouring in, you just don't want it.
