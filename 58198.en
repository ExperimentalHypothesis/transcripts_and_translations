Pre-wedding talk, Founex Ashram, Switzerland, August 24, 1984

Shri Mataji [to the children]: Ah! All the beautiful people are here? Good! All the little children are, let’s see!Hello, come along, come along. Now.Arnaud: Should I ask, Shri Mataji, if I could translate, maybe.Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.Arnaud: Not so many. Should we translate?Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.Arnaud: OK.

Shri Mataji: Now today, especially, we meet here for a very special, joyful program. Now the first thing is that we had, in Switzerland, a very important function: Guru puja. This is the proof of your achievement to have such a great puja over here. Second is to have Shri Ganesha puja itself is another great, very great blessing. This puja can only be performed in a place which is very pure. And the mountain that we have seen is such a pure symbol of that purity. Maybe the innocence in that country is flowing through that mountain. And the whole place is filled with vibrations, I could see. So, to have a puja there is a very big privilege and also will definitely help this country to achieve their lost innocence. So, now, I am looking forward to that puja. But the most joyous thing that should happen in this country, is the marriage of twenty-four persons.[Applause]

Oh, twenty-four couples! Now she got a fright, poor child. Oh, no, no, no, no. It’s all right, you should also clap. You should also clap. Poor dear, you should also [Shri Mataji smiles] She’ll get used to our madness very soon. All right, take her up. No, no, no, no. All right, all right, she got a fright.

Now these marriages are of twenty-four couples not persons, but twenty-four couples. Now the proposal was that we should have the marriages on the mountains. So, we didn’t know how to arrange it. In the Sahaja Yoga marriage, there is first the girl has chosen the boy, it’s called ‘svayamvara’. So, she walks up to the boy and garlands him first. And then the boy garlands the girl. But there is no place which is so plane. So, we thought that we will place them on top of the mountains and they will come skiing down, and garland each other.[Laughter]

And there is a custom of applying that ‘haldi’, a kind of a yellow powder. It is very good for the skin, if you have any, sort of problems on the skin, or any-what you call- scratching or anything you are comforted during the wedding time otherwise you’ll be uncomfortable.Arnaud: Mosquitos.Shri Mataji: Mosquitos. So, because of all these problems, we did not know how to manage it on the mountains. So, we thought of having the weddings in here, in the ashram. Already, there were forty-five couples who wanted to marry. But, I requested them if they can wait till India, it would be better for me. But some are re-marriages. Now this marriage, we have quite changed for our use, for our Sahaja Yoga use: the marriage system. Of course, basically, we have used the system of India because it is a very joyous style of marriage. It’s not a very serious occasion.Arnaud: Black and white.[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: So, but we have changed it for our use, for our own purpose. Now, in this marriage, we have avoided all that was funnily introduced by our priests. Or all of their useless rituals which were no good, but keeping all the delicate points, that give a little sweetness to the temperament of the people and a feeling of involvement to everyone. Even to, you see, perform this kind of a marriage in Bombay, was also very difficult. Because in a real traditional marriage, you need seven days. And so many small things are there, that it is impossible, you see, to comply all those necessities.

But our family is very traditional and my husband’s sister was very particular on traditional marriage. We had to have seven days marriage for both my daughters in Bombay. But people were so kind because they were so attached to me, all of them, that they were very, very helpful. They were not Sahaja Yogis, but they helped us in so many ways. For example, we had our cooks in Lucknow, in my family. And I go very seldom to my family people. As it is, I am busy with Sahaja Yoga. And in little time, I see some of my friends in Bombay or Delhi. So, you can imagine, we had about two thousand people staying with us for about one month. [Laughter]And for the reception, we had about 16 thousand people. But in India, the thing is, everybody thinks marriage is a very auspicious thing and everybody must help. So, we had a guest-house in one big building, and when they heard that we are going to marry our daughters, they all others vacated the house and gave all the seven floors to us. Because it is regarded as very, very great punyas, great achievements of spirituality if you can do or give or donate something for a marriage of a daughter. 

And I had written to my cooks also that they should come for the wedding of my daughters. So, they sent us a telegram, "Bring two trucks to the station". My husband keeps off everything, so he was quite amazed at this demand. So these cooks, you see, they came with huge, big utensils and huge, big – what you call them - ladles and all that, very huge, big things, in such a big number, they thought if my daughters are getting married, there would be about thousand people at least. So, they brought such huge things with them, the two trucks were filled with them. Another fellow came. He said, "You bring a big car or some sort of a very huge van". And he brought for me, chicken’s bred [unsure] in one year. Because my daughter’s marriage, engagement, it took one year to marry them, between marriage and engagement. So, he developed so many chickens, you know, I think, five thousand chickens during that time.[Laughter]
