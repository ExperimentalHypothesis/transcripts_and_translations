Pre-wedding talk, Founex Ashram, Switzerland, August 24, 1984

Shri Mataji [to the children]: Ah! All the beautiful people are here? Good! All the little children are, let’s see!Hello, come along, come along. Now.Arnaud: Should I ask, Shri Mataji, if I could translate, maybe.Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.Arnaud: Not so many. Should we translate?Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.Arnaud: OK.

Shri Mataji: Now today, especially, we meet here for a very special, joyful program. Now the first thing is that we had, in Switzerland, a very important function: Guru puja. This is the proof of your achievement to have such a great puja over here. Second is to have Shri Ganesha puja itself is another great, very great blessing. This puja can only be performed in a place which is very pure. And the mountain that we have seen is such a pure symbol of that purity. Maybe the innocence in that country is flowing through that mountain. And the whole place is filled with vibrations, I could see. So, to have a puja there is a very big privilege and also will definitely help this country to achieve their lost innocence. So, now, I am looking forward to that puja. But the most joyous thing that should happen in this country, is the marriage of twenty-four persons.[Applause]

Oh, twenty-four couples! Now she got a fright, poor child. Oh, no, no, no, no. It’s all right, you should also clap. You should also clap. Poor dear, you should also [Shri Mataji smiles] She’ll get used to our madness very soon. All right, take her up. No, no, no, no. All right, all right, she got a fright.

Now these marriages are of twenty-four couples not persons, but twenty-four couples. Now the proposal was that we should have the marriages on the mountains. So, we didn’t know how to arrange it. In the Sahaja Yoga marriage, there is first the girl has chosen the boy, it’s called ‘svayamvara’. So, she walks up to the boy and garlands him first. And then the boy garlands the girl. But there is no place which is so plane. So, we thought that we will place them on top of the mountains and they will come skiing down, and garland each other.[Laughter]

And there is a custom of applying that ‘haldi’, a kind of a yellow powder. It is very good for the skin, if you have any, sort of problems on the skin, or any-what you call- scratching or anything you are comforted during the wedding time otherwise you’ll be uncomfortable.Arnaud: Mosquitos.Shri Mataji: Mosquitos. So, because of all these problems, we did not know how to manage it on the mountains. So, we thought of having the weddings in here, in the ashram. Already, there were forty-five couples who wanted to marry. But, I requested them if they can wait till India, it would be better for me. But some are re-marriages. Now this marriage, we have quite changed for our use, for our Sahaja Yoga use: the marriage system. Of course, basically, we have used the system of India because it is a very joyous style of marriage. It’s not a very serious occasion.Arnaud: Black and white.[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: So, but we have changed it for our use, for our own purpose. Now, in this marriage, we have avoided all that was funnily introduced by our priests. Or all of their useless rituals which were no good, but keeping all the delicate points, that give a little sweetness to the temperament of the people and a feeling of involvement to everyone. Even to, you see, perform this kind of a marriage in Bombay, was also very difficult. Because in a real traditional marriage, you need seven days. And so many small things are there, that it is impossible, you see, to comply all those necessities.

But our family is very traditional and my husband’s sister was very particular on traditional marriage. We had to have seven days marriage for both my daughters in Bombay. But people were so kind because they were so attached to me, all of them, that they were very, very helpful. They were not Sahaja Yogis, but they helped us in so many ways. For example, we had our cooks in Lucknow, in my family. And I go very seldom to my family people. As it is, I am busy with Sahaja Yoga. And in little time, I see some of my friends in Bombay or Delhi. So, you can imagine, we had about two thousand people staying with us for about one month. [Laughter]And for the reception, we had about 16 thousand people. But in India, the thing is, everybody thinks marriage is a very auspicious thing and everybody must help. So, we had a guest-house in one big building, and when they heard that we are going to marry our daughters, they all others vacated the house and gave all the seven floors to us. Because it is regarded as very, very great punyas, great achievements of spirituality if you can do or give or donate something for a marriage of a daughter. 

And I had written to my cooks also that they should come for the wedding of my daughters. So, they sent us a telegram, "Bring two trucks to the station". My husband keeps off everything, so he was quite amazed at this demand. So these cooks, you see, they came with huge, big utensils and huge, big – what you call them - ladles and all that, very huge, big things, in such a big number, they thought if my daughters are getting married, there would be about thousand people at least. So, they brought such huge things with them, the two trucks were filled with them. Another fellow came. He said, "You bring a big car or some sort of a very huge van". And he brought for me, chicken’s bred [unsure] in one year. Because my daughter’s marriage, engagement, it took one year to marry them, between marriage and engagement. So, he developed so many chickens, you know, I think, five thousand chickens during that time.[Laughter]

And then one fellow bought fifty-one goats. But the worst was, I told one gentleman that I will need some cow dung because it's regarded as very pure to do the little of the havana to be covered with it, you see.Arnaud: Cow dung?Shri Mataji: Cow dunk. So, I told him, "Little bit, I will need". And he brought one truckload! [Laughter]It's only good relationships, what could I do? You see, one truckload of cow dung! And then a very touching thing was there, that when I came home, I saw, I smelt beautiful fragrance in the house. So I went up and I asked people, "Who are- how do you get this fragrance?" They said, "There are some people who have come from some village and they said that, ‘We are just doing it to express our love’ for me because I have helped them a lot. So, I said, "Who are those?" He said, "They are just wearing one little linen cloth and they are from some forest". So, I went down to see who they were. I was amazed that about 12 years back, I was a chairman of a committee in which they collected lot of money for the emancipation of the poor people in that area, who are living on trees to make sanitoriums for them. And I did not know, I had forgotten about it. But they had brought by tonnes those incenses, in tonnes, by tonnes. And the, what we call the Halva are the sweet makers of Bombay. I never knew they liked me so much that when they heard about my daughter's wedding, every gallery was filled with sweets. And the guest said that, "Whenever you open the outside door, you find all the big, big - what you call them - baskets of sweets put there". I mean, so much it came that we didn't know what to do really it was so great, that we are- somebody sent us five trucks load of bananas! In India, they launch a ship with bananas. So, my husband said, "We can launch a ship with it". I really did not know how the whole thing went on. And so many people came and they had food and when my daughter went back, you see, she sent me a letter that as if the Annapurna has filled us up: they all were carrying big, big baskets of sweets and this and that. I said, "Who gave them? " I don't know all the people who had come for her wedding.

Even at a station, where they were to change the trains, you see, actually this train was one bogie they were going in, but they were changing the train. And they wrote to me that, "At the train somebody came with lots of ‘puris’ and ‘mincemeat’ and this and that", and fed all of them. And the name of the person they said, wrote to me saying that, "This was the gentleman who brought and he said, ‘You don't know how kind your mother has been’". And I don't know what kindness I had done to him anytime in life!

Even my elder brother remarked that there is a cinema actor called Rashkapur. He married his son and he spent 65 lakhs of rupees and it was not so grand! So, the whole thing was such an involvement. But that is the basis of Indian marriage: everybody must be involved. Like the barber, now, every family has a barber and the barber has to come to dress up the boy. And the barber’s wife has to, on the wife side, all the ladies of the barber’s family have to come. Then the washerman: his wife is to be given five ornaments either of gold or of silver.Arnaud: Washerman.Shri Mataji: Washer woman, you don't have. Doobies we call.Then the lady who sells these things [bangles], all her family people come and make you wear the bangles. And you are not to count or anything or find out the prices you have to give a lump sum of quite a big amount, at least 10 times more than the price. And then the one who makes the haldi, you see, prepares the haldi, you have to give her a sari and some ornament. Everybody is involved even - what you call- silversmith and the goldsmith and ironsmith, everybody's involved.

Now another thing is, you have to have leaves of at least 21 trees. This is sometimes not possible from one village or from some other village. So, you have to have those 21 leaves. But the worst of all, you have to have water from, at least, from seven rivers of India. Then you have to have the water, the leaves, and flowers of all kinds. But the worst is the condition of the mother of the daughter. [Laughter]

On one side, she has to sit on, with a ‘dholki’, singing songs. On the other side she has to take all these ladles like a sword and go to the kitchen rushing and doing the work there.And practically, every day she has to change three, four times her dress. Now this dress also is not of the same type. Like the sari that we wear, has to be from, say, from Benares or the lenga, that is a skirt, a big skirt very well carved. That is, say, from Rajasthan. And now the top of it has to be from another place. Then sometimes you have to wear a south Indian sari. Sometimes, you have to wear a north Indian sari. Sometimes, you have to wear a sari from Chanderi [Madhya Pradesh]. It’s another central part. All kinds of complications. And all that you have to do it for seven days. But it's nice in a way, you get lots of clothes. [Laughter]Because your brothers have to give you and your relations have to give you. For every occasion they have to give something.

Our marriage was done with the North Indian style. There is a kind of a thing with which you clean the rice, some sort of made out of kale, we call it ‘soup’ [sieve]. And the Bombay soup, they would not accept. You see, in Bombay, they don't even use it, because you see, they are too modernized now. So, one lady who was my friend she thought of it that I might not get this particular soup. So, she decorated it beautifully and brought one for me.

But Sahaja style marriage doesn't have any tension. But not in this marriage, you see. My husband was very particular about time. [Laughter]He made these poor people, you see, run up and down for the time. "Now time, have your breakfast". They would eat fast. "And run for your bath". They would have baths fast. [Laughter] And he achieved his result that the boy has to reach our house exactly at five o'clock and he did reach. He didn't come on a horse because my husband thought horse may take more time. So, he came by car. Or it may go wrong with the horse, you don't know, sometimes it starts running the other way round. [Laughter]

And all with him, you see, all my family people, my brothers are very meticulous you see. And they fixed that the girl should start with her garland at about 5 45. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi] I’m repeating all this to remember if anything is missing in your marriages, so I’m telling him now one thing more I remembered. [Laughter]So, when the boys arrived, you see, at the gate, you are supposed to receive and garland them. And they do a little puja there, the boy does.Arnaud: Bridegroom.Shri Mataji: Bridegroom, bridegroom. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi].But he came all right, the puja was all right, and the boy was about to walk to the stage, you see. And exactly at 5:45, my daughter started walking towards the stage. Because it was only one daughter, we had arranged very dramatic stuff, you see. We just went up and all that and she started walking. But there was no boy on the stage. [Laughter]So, you see, poor daughter was putting her head down, she was not supposed to raise her head. And walking slowly, I just looked at the stage, it was all vacant. So, I brought her back. And I rushed up: I found that the boy had gone to the toilet, you see. Because he was feeling uncomfortable with his dress, so he wanted to put it right, you see. So, half an hour it took more and my brother got angry he said, "Did you play any tricks in this?" [Laughter]"No, no" I said. The ‘bandwalas’ have not yet come, so it's all right, the band players. Because as soon as you garland, they are supposed to make a big sound with the band and all the crackers have to go up and all that. But it was all very timely, I should say. So, that's how the marriage was a great fun.Arnaud: I’m sorry Shri Mataji, there is no word for ‘fun’. You cannot translate in French.Shri Mataji: Fun? No ‘fun’?[Laughter]
