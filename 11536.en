I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, we have to know one thing that truth is what it is. We cannot conceptualize it with our human awareness nor can we organize it. It is what it was and it is what it is, it will be what it is. So to know it you have to rise higher than this human level into the level of spirit. Unless and until you do that whatever you think whatever you conceptualize creates problems.

That’s why all the scriptures have said one thing that seek the eternal and treat the transitory with all its understanding and limitations but this is only possible if you have become the spirit. All the saints have said that you have to know yourself, unless and until you know yourself, the illusion and ignorance won’t go. If you see in the Chinese right from Confucius, Lao-Tze all of them have talked about it.

For Christians, Christ has said the same thing, for Sikhs guru Nanak has said the same thing that you must seek the truth. And when these people have told you all these things about Sahaj yoga, it is very important to understand that you should not blindly believe anyone of us. Blind faith will lead you nowhere because you are seeking the truth. So unless and until you have found out the truth you are not to believe into anything blindly. If you just believe blindly into something or because you are born into something then you must know that there is something beyond it.

Moreover, Sahaj means ‘Saha’ means with, ‘J’ means born. Born with you is the capacity to this yoga means the Union with the all-pervading divine power. So the truth is the first fundamental thing that you are not this body, you are not this mind. You are not these emotions, nor you are this ego or conditionings but you are the spirit. This is the truth. That’s the truth is and unless until you become the spirit you will not know the truth and the second thing you have to know is that all living work that you see, all these beautiful flowers coming out of one seed, one bulb. All living work is done by this all-pervading power of God’s love.

So by becoming the spirit you know the second truth that is this power that is all-pervading but you do not know it only mentoring. All our knowledge is mentored but you know it on your central nervous system and this is what  all these Christians called it is Agnostics, the people who knew ‘Gno’, ‘gna’ word comes from Sanskrit word ‘dhyna’ or we also say ‘gna’ in marathi language, we call it ‘‘dhyna’’. So this Agnostics means to know and that’s what is the knowledge that is the gyanis, that is the real people who know not mentally but on you central nervous system you must feel this all-pervading power. Unless and until you do that and establish your connection fully you will not know what it the truth. Till then whatever you do is blind faith.

So you have to go beyond blind faith. You have to go beyond this and all of them have said the same thing again and again but we are forgetting it. We just read, we read about the prescriptions these saints have given us. As guru Nanaka has said that  unless and until you know yourself you will not see the illusion, we go on reading it, no use reading or the same thing Christ on thyself, now go on saying ‘know thyself’, ‘know thyself’. By saying ‘know thyself’ will you know yourself?

So, there is an arrangement within us, whatever is there they have shown you  just now and told you about is Australians have come all the way for Malasia. Now, these arrangements exist within yourself. Even here I would say that you should not believe when we tell you about all these arrangements we have within ourselves. But as a Scientist, you must accept what I am saying as a hypothesis and if it is proved to be true, as an honest person you must accept because it is for your benevolence. It will prove the existence of all these saints and what they have said it.

It is for the benevolence of your human body, for the benevolence of his mental side, his emotional side and it is for the benevolence of your country, of all the countries of all the world. So this has to happen, is called the resurrection time. As in the Quran, even Mohammad Sahab has said it’s ‘Kiyama’. At this time he said that your hand will speak, your hands have to speak and this exactly what happens in Sahaj Yoga. Your hands start speaking, you start feeling on your five fingers as shown their these 5-6 and 7 centres on the left side on the emotional side, on the right-hand side you feel mental and your physical sign. Now in certain countries,

I think some people are very introspecting like Russia. They must have told you about Russian experience. They are extremely introspecting and that’s the reason why it settle down with them in such a big way even the scientist, 200 scientists came and they took to Sahaj yoga, 600 doctors have come to Sahaj yoga, they are working it up. But it could be a cock and bull story, but one must know that falsehood can be found out very easily. When you go to anybody false, they will charge you money. First interest would be how much money you are going to give them.

Their interest is how much money you have in your pocket or they will have some other interests which are not in any way pure interests. The pure interests should be that you get your self-realization. Of course, for which you cannot pay and you cannot put in too much of effort. This is the basic thing if you understand, you can get rid of many false people who are running here and there. But if you are frivolous, you may do start guru-shopping and all that. There cannot be a guru shopping, the guru has to give you the real as they call it the ‘asal’.

The real, the reality has to be given. If reality is to be given, you cannot charge for it because it is so invaluable. So, those people who are seeking God, or those who are seeking their peace, seeking their own self-realization should understand one thing that you cannot pay for your self-realization. But, it happens like this that we are deluded by the way people advertise, by the way, people are pretentious. But there cannot be pretentious about Sahaj yoga because it is reality.

Now as it is the time, quite a lot has passed and these people have told you about you, today being the first day it was my style is that I am likely to have some questions from the audience. But sensible questions not aggressive questions. Because it is within you, it is your own power, its your own mother and tomorrow I will explain you everything this power that resides in you. This is the power of your ascent. So, is it possible for you to ask me some sensible questions about it, I will answer then we will have about 10-15 minutes session of self-realization.

16:58 Of course, I will let you know. I am now going to be here, I decided to be here only for 2 days, but I think I will be here for 3 days now and I would like to be meet the people of Malaysia, will be good idea. May God bless you!
