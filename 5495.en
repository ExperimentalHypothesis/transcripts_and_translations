"Illusions". Northampton (UK), 6 June 1978.

There must be some reason for having rationality in us. Why God has given us rationality? He doesn’t believe in values like that. Rationality gives us the sense to understand that we cannot reach there through rationality because unless and until this thing happens to you, you are not going to believe. You are not going to believe in it that this rationality on which we depend which is our support, which is we, we all the time think that our identification is complete with rationality and we are very rational, we are proud of it, the rationality also. So then you reach a point by, through rationality where you will understand that this is not the horse which will be useful any further. This is the use of rationality; one way it takes you to that culminating point where you think it is to be decided or cannot be dependent upon, on the other side rationality gives you a view, a view which can be related later on, when you get realized. You start understanding why rationality must be obtained, so it's, it's a teacher on a negative way, it's a teacher on a negative way, but it's a deception, because man was given freedom and he started using his freedom, he started using his rationality, when he reaches that point then he starts depending on his wisdom and wisdom is the balance between his emotionality and rationality, in the center, between his heart and his mind. It is a center somewhere there, in the central or you say in the fulcrum. So if you are too much on the emotionality or too much on the rationality you have to move further into the center and balance it. Then only you are in wisdom and that is how you are guided by wisdom. Any extreme behavior on the left or the right or dependant is not going to happen.

This you can understand through even emotionality. A person who is very emotional, he sort of loves, so what, everyone loves and he goes ahead with sincerity after that love, and then he realizes, “Oh! This is not joy. How could I fail in it?” So he says, “I have a broken heart”. Its better that he realizes that, so he turns to his head. But he turns to his head, his head to such an extreme that he gives up his broken-heart completely. It is in the center, in the center of your heart and your brain like the fulcrum point. Rationality and emotionality are two extremes but in the center so wisdom is an abstract word, what is wisdom? You ask somebody, “Is it wisdom? This is wisdom? That is wisdom?” Then how do you understand the meaning? By discarding, by saying no, this is not wisdom, this is not wisdom, this cannot be wisdom, here is you, watch your emotionality and your rationality when you start [questioning]. That is why I said these are negative teachers in the sense that they drive you towards positivity. In the sense that they drive you towards the reality. They teach you that this is not the correct, take any one of your, say politicals, political enterprises I would call, they are political institutions, take communism, you take capitalism and all these sorts of isms that you have all around, all experiments, all your political experiments which you have found through your rational mind, they cannot give a solution.

Democracy failed, communism also failed, any other monarchy failed, in the same way the demonacracy also failed, everything fails then you realize, is there any truth in going through these things, is this the way are we going to reach anywhere? Then you start understanding that “no, no, we all have made some mistakes now” but this is not possible for people who are running the race, who are running the race is not possible, for example I cannot talk to bureaucrats, because they are holding, they are carrying the bags, so some are democratic some are communistic, I don't know what sort of brains they have. So these big jollies are not going to get it, because for them that is identified, to them that, what they call is a perfect political institution in the whole of life and everybody must come. That's why when these different ideologies and different isms start flowering you find that they have not yet reached any flowering and they just shrivel up. They loose their existence, because rationality doesn’t give you that complete picture, it doesn’t give you the complete idea as to how far man can progress with rationality and how far he is going to achieve the result, what is the result, what do we expect, is to have joy. 

But any democracy or any communistic countries or any despotic countries, anywhere you go, you'll find people have no joy, they have forgotten how to even smile, we have give them an injection to make them laugh. So this rationality gives us an understanding that all our endeavors or all our enterprises which have been brought forth through rationality are not fulfilled. They show something but finish off, wither out. Same with our emotionality like we have, we have faith in God. You have faith in God, so anybody who says “I'm God” people run after [them]. They are many who are crazy like that. The other day only I was watching a TV show where they showed a man who said “I'm Christ” and he was the follower of Hitler, and he was killing people and he was doing all kinds of things and he had a big following. And the people were crying and weeping for him when he was facing his trial. One cannot explain these things. How these things happen? How can God do that poorly? And how could people who are talking about God could do like that? 

Because they play on the emotionality of the people, they think “oh I can bear fine”. I could cure many people. Oh I can make fine, you know, somebody that thing this thing, “oh I feel very happy with you”. What is the use? How you feel fine? What does it appeal to you? It is such a subtle type of diversion from reality, such a subtle type, that you cannot even make up. Specially the rational people cannot, they are befooled the first. The so called ego oriented people are befooled the first, this emotionality, to them anybody who comes with emotions. No, ties up with very big emotions and tears in the eyes and shout like a loud speaker. As he is actually going to die, appeals so much because that's the balance for their rational mind that they fall a trap. So this kind of a emotionality also can go to another extreme of madness, like you've seen people singing songs of separation from each other, sickens sometimes, you know.  Sickening, I don't know how people like it. The other day we had that musician came to Me, so I said “you sing Me a song”, he said “What type of song, Mother, You want to hear”? I said, “Sing us some song of Joy”. “Song of joy?” he was asking. He said “We have produced no song of joy for the last twenty years in this country anywhere”. None of them in the English society or the Western see. I said “No song of joy?” He picked up something somewhere, and which also has a sense of crying and weeping in it. I said “Oh! Now there is no absolute joy anywhere?”

Just think of it, the emotionality has reached to such an extent that you have lost all sense of joy, completely. You cannot depend on that kind of an emotionality, that in the church, you go and somebody stands at the pulpit and says “Oh, I am like that you see because my brain thinks, sounds and all that drama of emotionality. I mean. “Oh! What a saint?” So what. If such a thing is accepted in that, I can tell you, the rest assured, that when such a thing appeals to you, you must know that you are not facing the reality at all, you are not prepared to face the reality, you do not want to face the reality, you might give any excuse about it, you might, will identify yourself as “No, I am too much of a rational person, I am too rational, I cannot, I cannot accept,  this is beyond me, I just cannot” or you may even say “I am English with twins I cannot. Or somebody may say that I am too much of an Indian, I cannot accept this and that”. But when you say you are an Indian, first of all, you are misidentified and secondly you are misidentifying with one extreme or the other extreme. So before starting about your seeking, you have to understand yourself, which extreme you're standing, very important, very important it is to understand this part, where do I stand before I ask for self realization?.

The another thing about self realization is Kundalini; specially in the Western mind which I must tell you, why say western because you still have not gone to that end of rationality, that one has to understand that we are asking for it and truth is not going to fall at your feet, it is not a clinic opened out here where you have paid the money and you go to the doctor. I tell him “do I have fever?” in spite the fact you gave him money and you report to him that “what is this? I paid you ten pounds and nothing has happened to me so far, what about my health?” You cannot demand from the truth anything like that, now this is difficult for a western mind to understand, to Me also they treat Me in the same manner, while I risk good at receiving something. So I must warn you, nobody is going to fall at your feet or run after you that you get your self realization, no. That’s absolutely must be understood by all here. You cannot purchase it. You cannot pay for it. You cannot control it. You cannot ask for it. This is the great sense. This thing human beings cannot understand. They have never done like that. They have never seen like that. Everything is a shopping for them. So our shopping style of mind has to change the rhythm. We are not shopping God. There is no shopping involved. 

Whenever I meet people I find this attitude in them as if you have gone to the river Ganges to fill the bucket and the bucket instead of putting from the side where there is the place for the water to enter it, you are putting from the other side and then you say “How is it Mother I didn't get? There must be some trick about it”. Yes, there is. So please give me. It is difficult because we are used to pampering. Even doctors pamper us. They tell us lies even if there is nothing wrong, they give medicine, water injection within […] because they have to do their business. Everybody pampers their life, but here there's no question. There's no need to be pampered, you must know that those who come for you, will never leave you. They are doing it because they want to make money out of you. They want to befool you. They want to take advantage of you. They will never tell you. Why should they? If they tell you the truth you will never give them money because truth cannot be purchased through money. They will never say the truth. They will pay attention to your purse, to your position. They are not bothered at this stage that the human race has reached a stage where it has to jump. It has to break-through. It has to get into that collective consciousness. It has to become the new pot. That is most important.

They are very low key, but they appeal to you, because they appeal to your baser sense. Even rationality is a baser sense in man, take it from Me. Through rationality you can do all kind of baser things. Too much rationality can give you ideas how to plan, how to rob a bank, what perfect that is? how to rob a bank, how to kill a President, how to disturb somebody who is doing something good. This is possible very well through rationality and people wait through all that, without feeling any compunction of their conscience so what. So even rationality if somebody appeals to you for God, you should know God because many times you pampers your ego, “Oh, what an intelligent man, you are, you are very intelligent”, done for ever, “oh, you are very well read”, done for ever. Never believe. You cannot read truth either you cannot understand God through your ego. If you have such ideas, you cannot get to Him. How much was the reading of our Lord Jesus Christ, how many professorships He had?, what school He went to, and all the saints of the world if you ask, any one of them, how much did they spend, so keep away your rationality outside, there, just like your shoes. Be humble. 

This of course doesn't appeal because rationality pampers the ego and the ego is a big balloon. You press it from one side from the other side it comes and attacks but they are quite clever and I'm a Mother. I'm a Mother so I know how get it down slowly. You are not your ego by any chance you are neither your super-ego, you are joy. You are eternal. You have lost so please find. And those dwell upon you out of the ideas I cancel it but on reality. On reality, I'm not or something that is false. You must have seen the history that whenever a great sage came a great incarnation came on this earth, they could not talk to intellectuals. Kabir Das, again I would say who was very outspoken fellow, very outspoken, he said “padi padi pandita moorakha vahen” meaning that by reading the learned became damn fools. And the, and the Hindi poets you see, even today they criticize him that his language was very vulgar, was very rude, was very crude person, called himself as cult. Whatever you may say but he said that. 

This is the big Himalayan task for you I can tell you that, with all the rational people you are trying to solve the problem. Everybody very capable. They will talk like this “I believe”. Now what do you believe, what do you know? Wisdom you know. “I believe that this should be done this way”, lecture, what do you know, do you know that not even a leaf can move, be moved by your beings and [doings] and by your talking and jabbering and you do nothing. It is He. It is He who moves everything in this world. It is He who manages, organizes. It is who He looks after each and everything, and it is He who has created you and He who has created this great universe it is not you or your this stupid rationality. Please try, please try to understand, because I want you to find, that which is joy, which is beautiful, which is beautiful, the time has come. The time will come, you will come. Time will come but in your freedom you have developed such a big balloon in your head. Rather difficult sometimes, they can come and the divine exists in such people, lots of things and such people do not know what they want and you cannot ask God to get crystallized in your own bones. You have to accept Him and that's it. You have to just say “Lord, you can't”. Now, let us just enter into Your kingdom. Let us see for ourselves what is it like, come with an open mind, but you cannot get the mind that we know  this is not the kingdom of God and that is not the kingdom of God, this is not the kingdom.” See for yourself, humble down, have you found it so far?

The other day somebody came to Me, he said that “I want to meet God. I don’t want self realization”. As if they have voted for him and elected him for it. You want to meet God. Who are you? This simple question I am asking. How do you demand? What have you done? Do you deserve Him? Why should God meet? First of all your self must be cleared. In that mirror only you can meet God. What I want is not the point, because we have seen in the BBC people go round on the streets and ask them questions “Now, what is this? What do you say, What do you have to say? What do you have to say?” It is all right for political elections you see or if you have to sell some material, but for God your opinion does not matter. It is the opinion of God.
