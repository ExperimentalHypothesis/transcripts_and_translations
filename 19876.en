Public Program Day 3, John Muir School, Santa Monica (United States) 14th October 1981

Today I want to talk to you about the spirit which you have heard about such a long time. You have known that you have to be the spirit, you have to become the spirit. The spirit is going to give you rebirth. And what is that spirit is supposed to be. And actually so much has been said about it that spirit is the truth, it is the truth, you have to seek the truth. Now we must understand at the very outset there’s a big difference between something that is true and something that is truth. Like it’s a true statement, it’s an adjective. True is an adjective is a true statement that you have to become the spirit. It’s a true statement that you are to be born again. It’s a true statement that spirit rules. But it is not the truth. In the sense that unless and until you become the truth, true statement is like an advertisement you can say like a place or a sign board that indicates. For example somebody says that this is Saint Monic but that is not Saint Monica it just puts a sign board. If you see the sign board and you see the arrow going towards it unless and until you go into it you are still standing at the sign board. At this discrimination we should understand very clearly that the truth is the thing that you become and true is the thing that indicates. Many people believe that if you read about the truth you become the truth. They talk like that, I mean mostly ego oriented people I have seen, when they start talking about Geeta they think they have become Vyasa or they have become the Geeta themselves. To become truth is different from just talking about truth relating to it, saying something about it, to be the truth is the main thing which is the same thing if I tell you about the truth you don’t become, you have to become. But in any case I will try to describe because so many of you have to have your realisation you have got atma-bodha, the awareness of the spirit and that’s why I wanted to speak about it today. It is said that truth is the spirit and spirit is the truth. The rest of it is just an illusion, or the Brahma the all pervading power. Now what is the relationship between this all pervading divine power that you feel and the spirit. Spirit within you is the reflection of God Almighty Who is a witness and the spectator of the play of the divine power which is His power. So now we have three entities if you see clearly that first of all is the God Almighty you can say then His power, the power of His love which has another entity. And the spirit is the reflection of that God Almighty within you. We have another fourth entity you can say which is reflected in the spirit is the essence of this all pervading power. That essence and this spirit is the same thing. Once you touch your spirit you touch the collective being within you, immediately get collectively conscious should happen to you automatically. This one of the powers you get when you get collectively conscious. And also you get connected to the All pervading power because that is the power which emits collectivity. It is such a concord that we cannot understand. Concord between these three things, these what we call the Father and the Holy Ghost and the spirit. We call Him Jesus Christ. So these three things are so much connected with each other that as soon as you touch one you touch all of the other. Because they come out of one thing and one thing gets divided into three things which are absolutely connected. We cannot understand such a concord in human relationship. I mean you cannot find husband and wife or a child so much one with each other that you touch one you touch everyone. You get connected with one you get connected with everyone. Now the spirit within us connects us on one side as I said to this All pervading power. As soon as you become realised the spirit, the seat of the spirit is here. Immediately you become collectively conscious. You become. This is the first part of it. Now how do you become collectively conscious. What happens to you is that in your central nervous system you start feeling this All pervading power. First of all. This one thing happens to you. Then secondly you start feeling the centre of another person on your fingers. Thirdly you start feeling the centres within you. This is all the part of collective consciousness. That happens because first of all you get to the truth, you become the truth. And the truth is that you are the part and parcel of the whole. You become that. You are the part and the parcel of the whole. You are the microcosm you have to become the macrocosm. You have to become again I say it’s not just a brainwash or anything. You have to become. The becoming has to take place. When the becoming takes place then you become that truth. Means I don’t have to tell you - you are brothers and sisters now lets form you and something like that an organisation. It just happens you just start feeling another person on your finger tips. You start feeling yourself on your finger tips. And you start feeling that absolutely boundless love for another person and you feel like giving that person that relief out of love. Is not a love which is bias, which ends up into sex nonsense like that. It’s a love that just works compassion, just works out the compassion and it is such a flowing thing it emits free. As in Sanskrit it’s called Nirvajya which you cannot pay any interest on it, without any interest. There is no return for it. It just flows. And that’s possible only when you become the truth. You cannot help it. Even if you want not to help somebody you will help. Now what happens when you become the truth your attention, your attention sitting down here you are paying attention to Me. If I tell you can pay attention to somebody else. Sitting down here you can think of somebody else your attention is mobile. This attention of yours becomes the truth means gets enlightened and the beauty of it that when it becomes the truth it has got the purification power. Your attention has got it. Not only that, but all the information you get through this attention is the truth is the absolute. Like you place your hands now like this you get your cool breeze coming in. Alright? And you want to find out the vibrations of anyone, anyone of these people who is the realised soul among them. Now let’s see. They are dead they are no more. You want to find out who was the realised soul among these people. You just think of them. You need not put your hands towards the photograph like that. Just put your hands like this and you will know who are realised who are not. You get the absolute value of a person as soon as you start feeling the vibrations. Absolute value. Means you get the truth that is absolute. It cannot be challenged. Even if you have ten people or hundred people or thousand people, if they are realised souls if they are feeling this all pervading power then you just have to put your hands towards it and you can say all of them will say the same thing. When I gave realisation to one English man in London he couldn’t believe that his attention has become collectively conscious just couldn’t believe, because you see for these people who have too much of brain activity. They cannot understand. They believe in God but I don’t know what sort of belief they have. They think God is something in our pockets or some sort of a thing but if it is God or if you really become realised soul then you have to have certain powers of collectivity. So he said I am worried about my father I would like to know how he must be feeling now. Must be very easy. You just put your hands like this and think of your father. And he started getting the terrible burning on this finger at this part. He said what is this Mother what does this mean. I have come here to decode all these. I said this finger this part is of your father and this finger denotes Vishudhi chakra. This center. Now if Vishuddhi chakra is caught that means he must be down with very bad bronchitis. He telephoned. His father was in Scotland. He just telephoned there. [UNCLEAR] To his father how are you feeling? Father didn’t come to the phone. The mother said that your father is down with very bad bronchitis. This is the fact. Can you imagine you could get the information all the way from nerves. Nobody can believe. Not only that but sitting there one can cure also that problem. So the truth not that you get the absolute answer not only that but you can work it out with that purifying power that your attention has got. Other day I told you that if you take a television set send to India where people in the villages have not seen it. They will say what is this, just a box. But if you put it to mains they will see the [UNCLEAR] here with the fantastic way it is made. You are human beings who have made this box. A television. So how great you must be. The one who has created all these machines must be something great inside. Or we have no self esteem. And when it happens we just can’t believe it. We have no faith in ourselves. Leave alone faith in Me but you don’t even have faith in yourself. And thats the big problem that puts a barrier between you and the truth. When you become the truth then you start understanding what is good and what is bad, what is real and what is unreal. Yesterday you saw one gentleman who was here who is running a big foundation. I don’t know how he runs foundation in this place. I mean here no brains at all I don’t know how he is managing Americans so well. Somebody told Me he is minting money. I mean the one who was here you saw that dressed in the Kashaya – orange dressed fellow who was here. He has got a big house in Beverly Hills minting money. He said why do You talk of truth and all that. Just start some sort of a foundation and you can make lots of money. He is minting money here and people go to such people very happily and he said all the people of Beverly Hill are visiting here and paying him a big money and he calls himself a big foundation. Now the thing is you have to go because you have no discrimination. You don’t know. You have taken easily by a person who is on surface. I don’t know what impresses you so much. Somebody is a person wearing those dresses. Why should it impress you? It’s such a superficial thing. You can get it coloured in India only for two rupees. It’s not difficult to get these coloured clothes. I don’t know what impresses you people what makes you. He said I am charismatic. He thinks he is charismatic man the way he is minting money and he mints money here. No doubt. He has already got a house in Beverly Hills so you can imagine what sort of a thing it must be. Now all these things happen because you have no discrimination. Now discrimination should be logical to a point. Logically you can reach at a point but still it is indicative towards the truth. You don’t become the truth. But when you become a truth even a child when he becomes a truth he can say this is so and this is so. Even a little child can say. He does not have to have too much of logical sense or anything. That this is a thug. He can make it out from the vibrations that he is a thug. He is good for nothing. He is a thief. He can immediately say that is what it is. But you cannot because you are ego oriented. Anybody pampers your ego or somebody who mesmerises very good he is a very nice man. Like somebody told me yesterday that I went to this man and he just pushed my eyes inside and pained me a lot and whole thing and he said this is the knowledge, this is the knowledge, this is the knowledge. What is the knowledge ? What is the knowledge in it. The knowledge is that you become. Then I don’t have to tell you. Just have the feeling. You become[UNCLEAR] . I mean like this the discrimination has to be a part and parcel of your awareness. It just becomes. You just cant feel it. There are many people who can say that O I didn’t like to go to that house I don’t like this person I went to that person I didn’t like. [UNCLEAR] But this could be due to some conditionings , due to some ideas about it, its not absolute. And these absolute values have to be absolutely universal. We’ll take a simple example. Say for example we have the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci of this lady you know the smiling Monalisa. The mobile smile of Monalisa. Now she is appreciated all over the world. She cannot be compared with any cinema actress or anything. She is a very different type of person. Now if you see the vibrations of that picture you feel there are vibrations coming because it soothes your spirit. Thats why she is universally liked. Your ideas of beauty and all that may change but the spirit doesn’t change. Anything that gives happiness to your spirit is eternal. And that thing when you start feeling then only you can say that my judgement is correct. Before that it is either ego oriented or super ego oriented. Means either it is you speaking because you are an American, you are used to a kind of a thing, thats why you like it or may be I am an Indian I like particular a thing and I am this thats why it is happening. But absolute is universal. Its an universal character. It could be anywhere. Its just the same. Its just the same that a particular thing is universally having that co-efficience which emits vibrations. When a person is realised the whole being changes. Complete change takes place in that person. And the whole body frame, everything is so made that you start feeling the vibrations from that person. First time a human being really enjoys another human being like a flower fragrant is after realisation. Before realisation he cannot enjoy another person and then it becomes a beautiful work to give realisations to other. Because when you see a person becoming his realisation you feel as if the person has blossomed into that beauty. You enjoy that person. There is no question of then hatred. You just start enjoying that person because the beauty of that person has manifested. So is the beauty. Truth is the beauty for us truth in the normal sense mostly truth is extremely harsh, is very dry. Its horrifying. At the time of Manu the earlier days he said that you must speak the truth and you must speak the thing that is ‘priya’ means is dear to others. So at the time of Krishna they raised a question how can you combine these two things to speak the truth as well as it should be dear. If you tell somebody that you are egoistical as it is, he will blow you off. If you tell somebody the truth about a person he will be very angry. Or if you say you are possessed he may hit you back. So what to do with the person like that. How to tell him something that would be dear as well as its the truth. So he put another word inbetween. He said you speak the truth, you speak the ‘hita’ means for the wellbeing of the spirit and you speak the thing that is dear. Because if you speak something that is good for the spirit that will be truth no doubt. Today you may not like it. But in the long run you are going to like it. Because if I tell you something today that supposing somebody is attached to some horrible guru and I tell him O he is horrible don’t go to him. He might not like it. Its quite possible. He may not like it. But tomorrow he will discover. Tomorrow he will discover that what She said is the truth. Because he will go down everyday and everyday and then he will find out that what She was saying was truth. I should have listened to Her at that time. But supposing I just to passify I say all right very good you go to that guru and you do this. For the time being he may like it but once he discovers later on he will say what a cheat. She didn’t tell me the truth. So the truth is for the wellbeing of the spirit. And this is how Krishna solved this problem of making the beautiful thing as the truth. The beauty becomes the truth because then only you become the beauty. So this spirit gives you the absolute. The absolute. Before getting into it you live on relative values. Everything is relative and that is why there is a confusion. You don’t know who is a truthful person. You don’t know whether this is good or not. One person may say this is good and another person may not say it is not good. For example if you put one painting here for example this one or any one, any painting and you ask a person about ten persons to come and mark which part is bad. The whole picture will be off. If you call them again and say now tell us which part of it is good the whole picture will be off. You wont understand why the same thing which was discarded as the bad is now regarded as good. Why there’s such a confusion. The confusion comes in because you have not reached your absolute. If you become the absolute knowledge then you don’t have this confusion. Then you know for definite it is so and not only you will say but everybody will say the same thing because truth is only one. There cannot be two opinions about the truth. Then it is not truth. It is a relative thing. But the truth has to be one. For example whenever we have problems here, anybody coming from a problem I don’t have to tell them. They all will show Me the same thing here Mother this is he is catching. Everybody gets the same feeling. Everybody gets the same finger burning. Same thing is said by everyone whether its a child, its a grown up person or a person who has come only yesterday. He can also feel the same thing. This is what it is. For that you don’t need any brain washing, any teachings, nothing. You just become. As everybody who has eyes can see what is the colour of this thing, or you can see the colour of this wall. Everybody in human awareness. May be for an animal this colour may not mean anything. May be to fishes it may be but not to some animals. But to you it means yellow means yellow. You all know its yellow colour or cream colour or whatever you may call, in your language, is this colour. Everybody will know that this is red or this is blue or green. If somebody says that it is blue and it is green then you will say that this man is confused. You see because ten people are saying the same thing and this person is saying something else. So as far as our sense organs are concerned we know about them whatever we know is the truth. Like if it is hot , it is cold we know. But after realisation we go much deeper. Our sensation becomes our sensitivity become much deeper and we start feeling the deeper side which we cannot feel with our sense organs. This is the point is that you don’t know these things before realisation. After realisation you start feeling them, the deeper part of your being. And that deeper part of your being and of other people is felt because you become aware. So, spirit gives you the truth. You become the truth because you become one with the spirit. This is one quality of the spirit. Now as I told you that your attention becomes effected, it becomes the truth, it only picks up the truth and it accepts the truth as you grow. You would not like anything that doesn’t give good vibrations. I don’t even tell people that you don’t do this and you don’t do that because if you tell them before realisation they may not come to realisation. But after realisation you just discard automatically they are discarded. And you get finished with them. So, this gives you the power. The truth gives you the power. The will power to stand on your own feet and to take a stand as well. Like Christ you see when he saw this lady Mary Magdaline who was a prostitute and Christ had nothing to do, a saint has nothing to do with a prostitute, I mean there is no relationship that exists in a way and when he saw she was stoned he stood up he took a stand and he said those who have not sinned can stone at me. Such people when they have the truth the truth has that strength that you take up the stand, you take up a stand and that should happen to all the sahaja yogis. As soon as they become realised souls they take up a stand. But, some people start confusing those who do not want to be truth can confuse it with the fanaticism. Now, then when we see so clearly that a how fanaticism is different from a realised soul’s stand on the truth. Now supposing you have eyes and you can see this whole thing looks like a cord. You know this is a cord. But a person who doesn’t have proper eyes who is confused may think its a snake crawling in. So the person who sees can only see that it is a rope and he go on saying that it is a rope, it is not a snake it is a rope. I can see it is a rope. He will always say that whatever you may say it’s a rope. You are just frightened. And he can prove it to you that it’s a rope. So a person who is a realised soul will stand up, take a stand on his truth, on his finding and not only that but he will prove it to you that it is the truth. But which way can he prove it to you. Not by mental activity by telling no no it is the thing then you may go even worse. Only by opening your eyes. He can open your eyes and make you see putting on the light and he can say now see for yourself. Is it not a rope ? now can you not see? Because you understand the other person hasn’t got the eyes to see. He hasn’t got the light to see he must have the light. So he opened the eyes of the person and makes him understand that this is the rope and not the snake. This what happens to you when you become the truth. You become extremely gentle, very compassionate. You understand that they are planned you understand that this is slate. You also understand that they may fumble, they may ruin them. They understand all this, and then you are extremely compassionate and kind and patient with them. And you feel that they must be great. You see that they are getting drowned. You see them in the water being drowned and finished and you want to save them and you go all out to save. Like we have some people in England who got their realisation. They were Americans and I told them I am going to America and they all jumped in. mother if You are going we are going ahead of you to work it out. Because this is the truth let people find out. They gave up everything just came up to work it out. They paid their own money. They came on their own. They spent all their money. Everything they settled because they thought people should be saved. But when people do not have the truth they have some sort of a bile, they will come here either for money or for something to do this work and its untruth is such a thing that it drags many people in it. You have a friend, you will take him down, another friend you will drown, you think if my nose is cut why should others have their nose intact. It’s the other way round thing and so many people start getting drowned and drowned into ignorance and into darkness. Now whatever I am telling you about truth has been said thousands for years back and is been said again and again. But it was the true saying and whatever I am saying is true saying but again I am saying that you have to become the truth. Unless and until you become the truth, this is also just a true saying. When I was born my father told me one simple thing. He said I know you are born on the 10th storey but nobody is going to believe. They may crucify. First of all. If they don’t crucify if you write something when You die there will be another Bible [UNCLEAR]. You give realisation to 2-3 people, they’ll think these people are gone crazy they are mad, they are good for nothing. So You find out a method by which you give really en-mass realisation. Let some people go atleast to the 1st floor. See that, something is beyond and they take to it and they give to others because no use giving realisation to 1-2 people here and there and thats what I worked for many days and I worked it out and I found out the permutations and combinations of human beings and I should say that human realisation when they got I found out a method by which you can give realisation anywhere. Then I came down to America, the first country I came to was America because I knew I was sure, I felt the vibrations of the people here, and I thought this is the time I should go and tell them about this great happening. But, you know as Americans were that time very shifty people and I thought they have no value for reality. Just now. They have no value. They’ll have to go through all this nonsence of these gurus and all that otherwise they are not going to understand and thats why when I went back for 9 years I was there. Even now you can see how people are. They cannot take to reality, is very difficult. It is very easy to make plastic things you see. You can make thousands of plastic things. But if you have to convert a person into a flower that is very difficult, a reality, a real living flower and then to make it grow is even more difficult. People like something that is artificial and something that is convenient which you can manage, manipulate. You see like some people said Mother if you want we can give you money. But we cannot take realisation because it is too much. I mean for them it is easy to be member of some guru. They think this guru will be going to heaven and he will give them a pass and Pope can give you a pass, ‘Alright! You can come along!, you are here in the kingdom of heaven’. Come along and settle. This is what they feel. They feel that this should happen to us and then he is sitting down there. He is giving us all these passports and we just go there and it is very easy to pay some money to a guru and [UNCLEAR] and this is kind of a thing when it happens. Then people get more and more of these and they start evading the truth which one has to be, which one has to become. But this truth the spirit exists within you it is there, all the time it exists. It is very watchful, alert, all the time alive and its an eternal thing within our heart. The seat of the spirit is here on top of your head. In Houston I met a lady and she told Me that ‘God is sitting on my head!’ I said it’s a perfect thing, you know that. But, even if you know that it’s just the true thing you know but you have not yet become the Spirit. It’s the true thing she knew that God is sitting on her head! but she had not become and that becoming is very important and that should work out. And, when that works out you will be amazed how it helps you to understand all the absolute things of the world. Everything, all kinds of absolute problems can be solved but people have to be really prepared to accept the truth. Unless and until they are so, you cannot be forced, you cannot be forced! If you do not ask for it, it cannot be forced, because it is your free will which is respected. If you want to go to hell, as I said yesterday you can go very fast. But, if you want to become the spirit you have to ask for it. If you ask for it, it is there, you are made that way. That’s what you are finding, that’s how you will know the purpose of your life otherwise you have no purpose at all. Like this machine unless and until it is put to the mains it cannot work. In the same way unless and until you are put to the mains you cannot work it out. That is the source or which I am saying the plug. All this Divine force is your Spirit which resides in your heart. The second quality of the truth is that it is the source of joy, it is the source of joy. All the joys of the God. Joy is not a double thing like happiness, unhappiness. Happiness comes through your ego. If your ego is pampered you feel happy. If your ego is hurt or your super ego gets into problem then you feel unhappy. It is a double thing. But joy doesn’t have double. Joy is absolute. When you are in joy you become the witness of the play. And you start seeing it like a silent witness. That state of joy is a permanent thing if you achieve it. And you dwell in that permanent state of joy and this joy comes to you in case you have that heart to express that joy. That special heart if it is within you, if it has to work out then it opens. But in a place I would say where people are of more sort of thinking and using their attention too much and are busy with other things it takes time. Their brains are more developed. The light goes more to the brain. And thats how they first get the knowledge. The knowledge part of it they get. They understand all the chakras, they will know all about the kundalini, they will know how to move it, they will know how to give realisation, they will like My lectures. They will have all these things. More on the mental enlightened they will be. The brain will be enlightened first. But the people who are more on the left side as I told you yesterday about the right side people. The left sided people are the people who indulge into the bhakti, into the worship of God. Those who develop their heart more. They first feel the joy. They cannot get into too much into this acrobats of mental activities and trying to analyse everything and find out. So these people just jump into joy and they are enjoying. For example you have read Gregoire’s book. Now so many people have got this book and it is a very well written book. Of course we have worked together and it has come out very well no doubt. And you will enjoy it very much. But if you give to an Indian sahajyogi from a village or some place or even from Bombay they say what is the need to go to all this. I mean you have got it now you enjoy. I mean its like you cook something for someone very[UNCLEAR] you have done everything cooking and all. A person who is analytical whose brain is developed he comes from where did you buy this? How did you cook it? He will eat but he will ask that. So the enjoyment will be first starting in his understanding the knowledge of it. The another person will just eat it and very nicely just enjoy the taste. So there are two types of people. One type which enjoys first the knowledge and everything of it and then goes to the joy part of it. At the another side is the one who just jumps into the joy and finished with it. Specially children are like that. They just see the joy. They enjoy My company. They are here. They just enjoy , they relax , they sleep off and enjoy the vibrations and they just go off to sleep. They relax and they feel very happy about it. And they are not bothered as to find out what Mataji is saying and what intellectual joy they are getting. So there are two types of people. One of them are the people who are right sided and another on the left hand side. Now the left hand side people have other problems also. Because they are so emotionally bound. They are so emotional that they can get attached to things in a very wrong way. For example here you find that the people are not so much attached to their children in the west. Now in India you will find horrible people who are at the healm of affairs. Who are attached to their children that they can even sell their country for their children. And we have such horrible experience of these people that for their own children they will give up all that is collectivity. So the people who are on the right side have an advantage as far as the collectivity is concerned. While the left side people have an advantage as far as the joy is concerned. So the people who are fond of their own children, their own family, their own wife they will come to Me and they will say Mother –left sided, like in India, please help my mother, please help my great grand mother who died in a possession. Means she is dead. But you better have it. Mother can you help my brother’s wife real something you see. It goes on like that. Still for about a month he gets his realisation he is bothered about all the relations that he had. All the connection he has and its a big headache for Me. They will say why don’t You come to the hospital to cure my sister who is very sick. All these things start working out with people who have emotional type and the attention goes diverted. When you get diverted in those attention your growth is definitely hampered. And can be very dangerous also because these people to whom you are attached may not be the type of people to whom you should be attached to. You have to be detached with them. So a kind of an attachment which develops, which drags you down. While the people who are attached to both knowledge and to intellectual feats also develop an ego that oh we have come to know so much about sahajyoga. Oh we are very clever. Now we know this and know that and they too are dragged. Both sides there is a problem. So one has to be in a central line central path of evolution which Buddha has said that you should be in the center. Not to go to too much to the left and too much to the right. Because as I told you if go to left side too much you jump into collective subconscious and if you go to the right side you jump into the collective supraconscious. Now the supraconscious people who are there, dead, those who are ambitious people are giving lots of information even about sahajyoga. They are telling you see there are people who are writing on the walls about Me. They write poems about Me, stories about Me. Thats the truth. They are telling about them they are telling the truth but they are not the truths. There are many people who have prophesised about Me. But whats the use I tell them why don’t you take the realisation. Like this lady—what was her name? ..... she announced about Me, My birthday everything she announced. And when I came to America I told her why don’t you become realised – she said I am not interested. I had told about You finished. I am not interested. She didn’t want to get realisation. Can you imagine? She wouldn’t get her realisation because she was thinking that she will lose her powers to prophesise and that she didn’t want to give up. Because they are so identified with their ego and supraconscious activities that they don’t want to give up. Like this Bible of …is also one of the advantages of that. You see people can find out about Me written very clearly in those Bible and all that. But 10% of that is still missing. And that 10% you get it you get the whole of it . if I go on talking the writer of this he will never accept to get realisation. It is absolutely true because he wants to see talk about. Like people there are psychosynthesis people. [UNCLEAR] and all these people talk of the same thing I am talking about. They want to talk about it. They don’t want to become. They have made the stage completely ready for sahajyoga to happen. But if I go and tell them you become realised they will deny. They wouldn’t like it because thats their profession. They want to have it. I have seen people in India specially there are some people who are writing books about Me. There’s one gentleman who saw in a photograph that was given to him by Sainath his father and sainath had told him that Mother is going to come and you will see Her picture on my robe. He is wearing a robe and My face is shown there on the folds. The folds are there. This man wrote a big book and was published and he invited so many people I didn’t go for that but so many people were there and he talked about Me. He said that this what happened there that this is the photograph and this is the Mother who has come and all that. But when I asked him why don’t you get your realisation he would not. Because he thought he is making money out of telling these things. I mean even it can become a very subtle thing. I would say there are people who are really thugs and those who are really we can say devils or anti Christ. Forget them. Even there are people who are like this who talk about the truth, no doubt, but they don’t want to be the truth. Its very surprising how people live with that. They want to live with it. They just want to continue. I will give you a very good example of the person like that – In India somebody told Me that somebody is writing about You on the wall. I said who is this one. And he said I would like Mother to come to my house and this and that. I went to his house. But he told Me that I am getting all kinds of statues of gods and goddesses from somewhere I don’t know. He showed Me. And they were wearing even diamonds. I said now what are you going to do about it. He said that this I am getting here I don’t know what to do I said throw them in the sea. Just don’t have it. Some dead bodies or some dead souls are trying these tricks on you these are temptation. You throw them away. He would not. He said but Mother I am writing such great things about You. But whats the use of that. You better get realisation I am not interested. Whatever I am let them find out. Who are you? Whats the use of it. He said many will come to you and I said you don’t try to tell Me all these stories. You better get realisation. And I think I have heard that he is very seriously ill. I mean he is mad now. Its not good to do that. You should become the truth. Thats the main thing that My interest is that you should become the truth. Even if you are few people doesn’t matter. you become the truth. I don’t want thousands to come here who are just living with the idea of the truth. You become- is the point. Those who don’t want to become I have no interest in them. I have no interest. Like some people would say that Mother You are so good at curing. Why don’t You cure these people and cure that people. I am not for curing at all. I did cure a very important man in India and they said the secretary of the health to talk to Me about that. And he talked to Me about that and he said that why don’t You cure this person and why don’t You cure that person. We can have the whole government can help you I said I have nothing to do with the government. I have nothing to do with the curing at all. Because its truth, is to be assimilated. The by product of that is that you get well. That’s all, its a by product. But whats the use of curing useless people who cannot oblige. In the house if you have a light which will never give light to others. Will you try to repair? I mean it is common sense. You would not like to waste your energy. Let that thing go back into the process of remaking and come back. Unless and until you are a seeker whats the use of giving you anything that is so material. What can anyone gain by this kind of artificial or outside happening. You have to become the truth. That is the main interest of God. God has no interest in people who do not want to accept the truth. He has no interest at all. They are just the waste. They are waste they are useless. They should say they are garbage. In the ultimate thing that is going to happen when the sorting out will take place such people will be nothing but the garbages. Good for nothing. Let them live with ego super ego whatever they like. But God has no time to waste on these people. He is not interested. May be as we can see that sahajyogies are very difficult to get into. In London I worked on 17 people for four years to crack their heads. Now we have thousands in London no doubt. English people have that innate scholarship with which that they have understood it so well. And I am happy that they are establishing so well in England. Say in America if it establishes well and good it has established in Hauston very well. If it does not in Los Angeles it will. Its alright. One is not bothered. Its only one thing one can do is to work it out. If it doesn’t work out you are not bothered about it because what can you do? I mean you cannot make a person enjoy some food that you have given. The enjoyment must come from within from that person. You cannot just say now you enjoy. How can you. Unless and until you develop the sensitivity. If you do not want to have the sensitivity of enjoyment you cannot force people about it. You can cook for them. You can put it into their mouth. Even if you want you can just little bit bite it for them but they have to enjoy with their own tongue. You cannot enjoy that food. Isn’t it? So that tongue has to be enlightened and if they do not want to be enlightened what can we do about it? You just cannot force him. It is very simple as that. Because if they think that they are happy let them be happy. We cannot force things into them. This is the fundamental truth about sahajayoga. Whether you like it or not. It is you who has to ask for it. It is you who has to get it. And it is you who has to enjoy it. Its all your own. I have nothing to do with it. Only thing is it is placed within you. And I can just help you to enlighten it because I am enlightened. And you can enlighten other people also. But if you are not interested in enlightenment no use coming to My lectures. I have seen many people you see who come to me, say, O She speaks very well. We should go and listen to Her. And this is very good speech and all that. And then they walk off. They don’t want realisation. At the time of realisation they won’t even take out their shoes. They won’t even put their hands. So why I say yes? I mean such superfluous people also come to Me. Absolutely superficial. But they come. And in India I have seen many villagers have come. They just sit down for a while. And they say now we have taken the darshan of Mataji, now we are very happy , we are going. They will come all the way from miles together in their bullock carts, settle down there in their villages. Thousands. When I go there ‘Mother we have taken Your darshan now’. Now they won’t take their realisation. They say we just want to touch Your feet. I mean My Feet can be swollen like that those thousands of people coming on My feet. If you tell them you are not to touch My feet, nothing of the kind you get your realisation. They say no we are only interested in touching Your feet. They are brought up that way. They are conditioned that way. I said you are brought up in listening to lectures. See you go to this lecture. You go to that lecture, go to that lecture. O [very well] you want to assimilate all these things to your head and think O we know all about kundalini. You know but you are not. So in the first lecture I said you have to be honest. Truthful to yourself. Do not cheat yourself. And know that you are that spirit. You have to become that. No use just cheating yourself all the time and being away from the truth for which you are born on this earth, at this time to get it. You are here for that. If you have no self esteem what can I do? I cannot pump it into you. And this is the problem I always face, whether here or in India, with many people. That their idea about God, the idea about getting to it is so superficial. Why they are deep? They are made so deep. They are being built up for thousands of years. They have just to become – its so simple. But they are not. They are not aware of their depth. They are so superficial. They live with superficiality. And they have managed their life with it and they think we are alright. This is the way people look at it. I want you to be aware of that depth. But not mentally only listening to Me- Oh! yes Mother said so. you should get it. Thats My anxiety that you should get it. And you should get to it. If you don’t want to have it I will be the last person who will say that I can do it. I cannot. I am sorry I cannot. First time when I came to America there was a lady who came with Me, travelled all the way and she called her son from Honolulu. She had only one son and he came to Me and we tried to give him realisation. He couldn’t get it. Just couldn’t get it. This lady said Mother all the way I have called you from there, I came only for this. You see these Indians are very attached to sons and things and that. So You must give him, You must do it. I said but how? You give it, you are a realised soul. Why don’t you say he is realised. She said how can I say he is not giving any vibrations. He is not realised soul. How can I give false certificate. So I said thats what it is. If he doesn’t get it, he doesn’t get it. He may be your son. He may be anything. What can I do about it? It has to work out. Because there is no seeking. There is a problem is of his seeking. She said he is a very good man, a very dharmic person, doesn’t do anything wrong. I said it makes no difference. You must have the seeking within you. Even a person may have done mistakes, may have done anything. But if he is a seeker, if he is a true seeker, he will get his realisation. But there are many people in India who never drink, never smoke, eat vegetarian food, you see they put their eyes on the ground. There are many like this. But if they do not seek God and they are just satisfied with these virtues, they are only at this point which is what you call is a void, is a center of it where dharma is there , balance, they are just balancing. Still they are balancing. They have to rise. And how will they rise above. They will only rise if they are seeking. And once you seek you become your own master. You all have become. Only thing is you just have to desire it. But that desiring you cannot pump into anybody. You cannot force into anybody. It has to come from within, within yourself. If My saying that can create that desire, I think whatever I said has some meaning, atleast some effect. And that would be the best that I could expect. I wanted to talk to you about the centers but today I don’t think I will be able to cover but tomorrow at Panorama I will again speak about all these centers that are within you. And how you are built in but gradually we are moving towards that today they wanted Me to talk about the spirit. So I have talked to you and you also asked Me question yesterday what is the spirit. So tomorrow and day after tomorrow these are the only two days and now in this place Los Angeles which means something great – Los Angeles. And lets see now when the angels get awakened and get to it. Then I will tell you all about it. Tomorrow about the chakras and day after tomorrow how [UNCLEAR]. Luckily we might get a place here somewhere we are trying to find out a place for a center. And if we can really manage to get some place for a center we would like to start a center and we will inform you about it where you can after getting realisation learn the divine technique by which you become the guru. You can give realisation to others. And you can grow by giving to others. You cannot grow if you keep it to yourself. Its the question of collectivity. If you just sit at home Mother we do Your puja, we worship You, we take vibrations from You, nothing happens. You do not. You have to give. Otherwise you stagnate. People grow only when they give. Sahajayoga today is for giving and not for preserving yourself. That time is finished. You have to become a complete capitalist in the sense that you know all your powers and you have to be a complete communist that you distribute it. You cannot enjoy, you cannot go unless and until you give. So such a combination it is and this is what is. The artificially we are doing politically these things. Artificially it is. But inside when you become that collective being all these artificial things find their meaning. May God bless you all. You can ask Me some questions. And then we‘ll go for our realisation.



Sahajayogi-She would like know little more about supra conscious and the sub conscious.

Shri Mataji- collective sub conscious is on the left hand side. See now you can see from the character of a person on the left hand side. The left handed person is the person who is emotional. He is not aggressive. He takes aggressions upon himself but he is sly. He can be mischievous. He can be very cunning. He will work it out in such a way that people will not know how he works out the things. Thats the left sided person. And he might be sort of ..... so the supra conscious is the other side of it. It is the right side of a person. Is the right side when a person aggresses. She aggresses or he aggresses the other person and he doesn’t feel any harm from it. When you go to the collective sub conscious on the left hand side the entities from the left side who are sly who are busy bodies who want to show off, see in a way can enter into you, can possess you. They make your body pain, you get pain here, you get pain there. You get all kinds of things like accidents. All such problems, even cancer. Cancer is only caused by that. Epilepsy and all troubles of the mental troubles like madness, lunacies, schizophrenic and all those confusions that you get out of these possessions, they take place from the collective sub conscious. Some of these horrible people who are working on you, these techniques of mesmerism of different types push you most of them push you on the left hand side. Some people do put you on the right side. Some of them who just make you overactive for a while, you become very speedy and another personality comes on you and you start becoming extremely active and you start seeing things in a way that as if you are riding a very fast horse. And this happens to you, you become very successful also sometimes for the time being. But then you are tired because one horse is carrying two personalities and it could be ten personalities. You get tired. By the time it is our 3-4 years you start shaking, rattling you get troubles from the nervous system and could be very serious [for being]. Now the collective sub conscious people as they enter into you I mean even I would say alcohol can take you down there to collective sub conscious. All these so many drugs also take you but not LSD. LSD takes you to the right side. But so many drugs can take you to the left side and if you are driven too much into it then you get possessed and you get confused. Right hand side movement in the supra conscious gives you illusions, hallucinations like LSD does, and if you go further with it like I would say there were supra conscious people in South America many many. I went to Columbia and they used to use a kind of, even now you are getting them imported from Peru these stuff they call them embrosa, is a kind of a LSD of very fine quality. They used to take that and with taking that you see they had a special type of thing in which they used to grind it and take it. By that doing that they went into their ego, projected their ego too much, to such an extent that they could see things on the right hand side like they could see the gods and the most amazing thing I saw was that they had the concord as the emblem of their navy – concord. I asked them how can you have condore the condore as the emblem of their navy. So I said how do you have condore as your emblem because navy has nothing to do with a condore the very big event. They said our old people our old people tell us that an Indian god means from Bharat – from India, Indian god called Vishnu came on a condore. Can you believe it? They get all knowledge in this dousing business. They get the knowledge about say the moon and the stars and like [Cyrus] see they knew about it. They know all about these things – the material things and about the stars and the moon and the galaxies and all that, prophesies. All these things can happen to them which looks like truth. Which is truth. Which is truth. But the superficial level on the right hand side. The left hand side people can work out in a very subtle way. I will give you another example how these left hand people work out. Very surprising how they know things – they can read your mind and they work out, they are very much concerned with each other. Like there was one gentleman who wanted to bring his friend for his treatment who was suffering from some sort of possession. And he went to receive him at the station and he couldn’t get him there. So he wanted to telephone and he went to the post office to telephone and in the post office the post master himself was sitting and the post master said that why are you going to Mother? She is doing very important work. Why do you want to trouble Her? He was shocked how did he know all these. He said you see this gentleman requires lot of help. So I will tell you how to help him. There is a Ganesha’s temple at such and such place. Go there and just take one coconut and give it in that temple and this fellow will be alright. So he went with one coconut. He gave the coconut there. This fellow felt little better because he had a possession by which he used to get drowsy, he used to sleep too much and he used to feel very funny. So when this was cured you see the second thing that happened to him that he started drinking. And drinking like hell. So they went again to the temple. He said this time you better give sawa tola of gold to that temple. And the fellow got addicted to that and this sahajayogi also went down. When he came I said where did you go? Oh! He said I went to that temple Mother – just Shri Ganesha’s temple I didn’t want to trouble You. Very subtle I said really? I said it was a wrong thing to go and this fellow died of an heart. Can you imagine? I mean that is what it is. I mean they are so clever so cunning. And they know so much. I mean you go to these gurus beforehand they will know who you are. The ESP business. All these things work out though left side. I mean there I can write a book on this left side and right side. Better thing is to read Gregoire’s book. He has written something about it. There’s no end to it. But best thing for this to know is to really experience them and see what sort of people they are and how they behave under the influence of these things. And how they talk. They talk the same way, behave the same way. Its very interesting.

Sahajayogi(to audience)- any further questions?

Sahajayogi- You mention not only about determining what a problem is with another person but also help to correct that problem. Could You Explain that?

Shri Mataji- you see that I will cover up in the last lecture. Alright? Because that’s quite a big thing – how to correct others, how to give realisation. We will keep it all that the workshop we can call it. The last day in Panorama. Alright?

Sahajayogi- Is Your house in Mount Abu in India?

Shri Mataji- its true. She recognised. You can find the answer. Saptashringi. Its correct. She knows. I have houses all over my child. Alright? See the vibrations.

Sahajayogi- 24

Shri Mataji –(laughes) can you recognise the face?

Sahajayogi- [unclear]

Shri Mataji – and the fragrance also you get of gugul. Thats the beauty of Indians. They know quite a lot. Easy for them to recognise Me. See they know all these things. While here people like some charismatic person who comes and makes you just blunt. Oh! he is charismatic. I don’t know what appeals to people. I just cant understand. There is a guru who is only 5 feet 4 inches I tell you. An ugly looking person, absolutely ugly from every angle. And I have atleast seen 10 ladies who came and told Me that they are in love with him. He is only 65 years of age. And young ladies just falling in love with him. I just can’t understand how can they be falling in love with him. They are just in love with him Mother. I said alright go and love him. Stupid people I tell you. With all this intelligence how can you behave that stupid. To be mesmerised like this I mean imagine a guru falling in love with the disciples. Can there be greater absurdity than that? I mean I just can’t understand. Like these nuns marrying Christ. I mean this is really [unclear] What do you think of Christ? He is innocence, He is purity. What business have they got to marry? They better marry some human beings. All sorts of things are going on in the name of God I tell you. I just can’t understand how can you judge God that way? You must have some sense of purity, of holiness, of auspiciousness. But we are so mixed up I tell you so mixed up.

Sahajayogi- [unclear]

Shri Mataji- I will be in Panorama city. And you all are welcome there. And two days we are doing there programs. But I hope next year I will come definitely here. And we’ll have better organisation and better way of putting up things. Next year. But we are going to start 3 centers. Atleast two. One in this area or Beverly Hills area. There’s one gentleman who has offered a place for center you see. And we have some people who have come from England who would like to start in Los Angeles. And one center we can start in [Ceretos] because we have somebody son of one of our trustees who is staying in [Ceretos] there also we can start one center. One day in a week we can have it there. Just now we will start only two centers. And you people should look after it. I mean there’s no question of money or anything but you have to go there, attend to it and they will have my tapes. And you have all the arrangements for you to receive. All the information and knowledge and also we have got a magazine from India. Have you got it? We have a magazine from India which is also circulated. One magazine from Australia which is also going along. Thats how we all get connected with each other. And the people from England would be visiting they are very good. They are very well off now. I mean they know such a lot about sahajyoga. There are about 300- 350 tapes of My lectures in England which they would like to bring it down here. 21 they have got here which we can copy. You can take the tapes with you. Also you can copy them or you can give the tape and tape it. I mean only whatever is needed for the tape you have to pay for the tape you see. In sahajyoga we don’t believe in exploiting anyone. Neither the sahajyogies should exploit the other people. Like you see the people will ask for free. They say that give us this thing. Even the tapes free and all that. Because we are not collecting any money. So if you want to have a tape just give a tape to them for taping or what you can do is to pay for the tape itself, see whatever is needed so that there is no pressure on the person who is running the center here. You see it should be mutual understanding between you people. And somebody gave money yesterday I was told that we don’t take money from anyone so that should be returned to that person. So we don’t take money. Only the sahajyogies themselves can collect money. Supposing this hall is to be done. Now its all partly My own money and partly from the sahajyogies in London. They have paid for it. But lateron when I come let Americans pay for a hall like this. And I can come here. You have to pay for the hall not for Me. You have to pay for the hall. That’s how it works out everywhere so that I do not have headache of money because I am hopelessly bad I don’t understand. So you manage everything where ever you say I will come and I will give lectures and I will give realisation but as far as money is concerned I am hopeless. I don’t understand.

Sahajyogi: - any other questions?

 Shri Mataji-(some conversation with a person) I must tell you a good story about China and Russia. Its very interesting that Sita had two sons twins called Luv and Kush and you see Rama had sort of sense in the wilderness because people criticized her staying with Ravana whatever it is, so these two boys didn’t accept his kingdom – Ayodhya. And they went across India. One of them went to Coccacious, another went to China. This Coccacious fellow went actually to Russia because he established his kingdom there and that’s why it is called ‘Slav’ from Luv. His name was Luv. And the another brother who went to China is Kushan. His name is Kush. Now imagine these two brothers are fighting what should I feel about them. I mean there is nothing to fight. Nothing to fight. I mean this fighting is all nonsense. And that all these problems can be solved if they get realisation. That’s the only way if you become universally conscious. Everybody is just the same. There’s no difference at all. Fighting for what? [ UNCLEAR ] I am sure some wisdom will come. It will happen. But you first become proper foundation. You have to be good foundation. Solid foundation. Then one can work it out.
