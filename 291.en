b'\nSahastrara Puja, \xe2\x80\x9cJump into the Ocean of Love\xe2\x80\x9d, Sorrento (Italy) 6 May 1989.\n\nLast night was a night of complete darkness, that they call it as amavasya; and just now only the first phase of the moon has started.\xc2\xa0Today we are here to celebrate the day when the Sahastrara was opened out. Also you have seen in the photograph. It was actually a photograph of my brain, which showed how the Sahastrara was opened out. The light of the brain now could be photographed. It\xe2\x80\x99s something great these modern times have done.\xc2\xa0So the modern times have brought a lot of things which can prove the existence of the Divine. Also it can prove about me. It can convince you what I am. This is very important because, in the modern times, this advent has to be recognised, has to be fully recognised. This is one of the conditions for all the Sahaja Yogis.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now let\xe2\x80\x99s see what\'s happening in the modern times, in the brains of the people. In the brains of the people today, if you see, there is an attack on the Sahastrara. There has been an attack since long but in the modern times it\xe2\x80\x99s the worst time. They are trying to make the limbic area very insensitive. Very depressive novels, very depressive thoughts and very depressive music, you can say, like Greek tragedy nonsense. All these things came from the medieval period till, we should say, this new age has started. That one itself was no good for our limbic area. That made us very depressive. We took to alcoholism to escape from the so-called miseries.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But then came this modern age in which people became overactive - over-activity started. With that the brain also became overactive. In addition to the dullness before, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the other extreme of over-activity. So to dull it again they took to drugs, they took to very horrible music. That\xe2\x80\x99s how they made this limbic area very, very insensitive. So a drug which was just a stimulus to begin with was to be taken in greater quantity and later on they had to take the drugs which were of a much more severe nature. It went on like that and now we know that this drug is the only way people think they can survive. Why? Because of the tension [that] they talk of.\xc2\xa0In the modern times we have something called \xe2\x80\x98tensions\xe2\x80\x99. It was never there before. People never talked of their tensions. Now every body says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in a tension!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou give me a tension!\xe2\x80\x9d What is this tension? It\'s because of my advent. The limbic area wants to know about me. And the Kundalini also, as Sahaja Yoga is increasing, is trying to rise in people; because you become the channels. Wherever you go, you generate vibrations, and these vibrations give a challenge to the Kundalini, or a message, and in various people it rises. It may not rise up to the Sahastrara, or it may even rise up to Sahastrara but it falls back, because there\'s no recognition.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So every time they do something, this Kundalini comes up and gives them a pressure, because their Sahastrara is not open. It\xe2\x80\x99s a closed door. Because of the closed door this gives them a kind of a pressure in the head, which they don\'t understand, and they call it as \xe2\x80\x98tension\xe2\x80\x99. Actually the Kundalini is trying to push it out, itself, but it cannot. And those also who get their Realisation, if they do not make their Sahastrara alright, they go on getting into tensions. So, though Sahastrara has been opened out so many years back, still we have some things to be done - is to clear out our Sahastrara, first of all.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara, then once it opened out, the brahmarandhra opened out, then we started feeling the grace, and it moved onto our Ida and Pingala - the grace not the Kundalini. And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round, soothed down our Left and Right sides by which our chakras opened more, and more threads of the Kundalini started piercing through.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that you must meditate. If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras will be alright because, as you know, that the peethas, or the controlling centres of all these chakras, are in the brain around the limbic area. So if your Sahastrara is clear everything works out in a very different way.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0How to keep the Sahastrara alright, is the big problem [which] always people ask me. You know that I reside in the Sahastrara. I have incarnated on the lotus of one thousand petals. That\'s why I could break it also. As I am today, as you see me. Of course they say, \xe2\x80\x9cSahastrare Mahamaya\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe0\xa4\xb8\xe0\xa4\xb9\xe0\xa4\xb8\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xa4\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xb0\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xb0\xe0\xa5\x87 \xe0\xa4\xae\xe0\xa4\xb9\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xae\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xaf\xe0\xa4\xbe) So this is the illusion which is all the time there for you, which is very elusive. It had to be that way because you could not have faced me otherwise with all the lights coming out of me or the way you saw yesterday Sahastrara - some sort of abstract colours thrown on all sides and the lights thrown outside.\xc2\xa0Please don\xe2\x80\x99t take photographs when I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking, alright? You can take later on. There\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry about. Just pay attention to My lecture. Please, pay attention. It\xe2\x80\x99s important. It is to be, this, told beforehand, that nobody should take photographs during puja because it is a very intense thing [that] one has to work it out. Please, pay attention. Even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, it has effect on you. So I would request you to pay full attention to me when I am talking. It works better.\xc2\xa0Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after by you. It\xe2\x80\x99s the temple of your Mother. When you say you put me in the heart, actually you put me in the Sahastrara. Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here (Shri Mataji touches her brahmarandhra) is the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha, the centre, which controls the heart, which is the seat of the Sadashiva or you can say of Shiva. So when you put me in the heart actually you put me there. So to raise it from heart to there, or to bring it from there to the heart, is the problem of two types of people.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some people who are sensitive in their heart - I would say in Europe we can say Italians are very sensitive on their heart - the first thing they do as soon as they see me they put their hands to their heart. And that is what it is, that, if you try to feel me in your heart, to begin with, it\xe2\x80\x99s much easier. To feel me in your heart. Now you might say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d You have to love me as I love you. You have to love each one of yourselves, because you are all within me.And you cannot teach someone how to love. Love is within. And love manifests if, just, you open your heart. Now what stops it, we should examine that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Firstly, the conditioning. In the West to express your love is regarded as sinful actually. It takes them time to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI love you,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cI hate you!\xe2\x80\x9d even a child could go on saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI hate you! I hate you! I hate you!\xe2\x80\x9d But to hate someone is sinful. To anyone, to hate, is sinful. So to say that, \xe2\x80\x9cI hate you! I hate you!\xe2\x80\x9d is a sinful act. So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d After all, you must love a person who is so dear to you. Anyone who has done something good for you, you love that person. But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you the rebirth, it should be the easiest thing to love. And if She says that, \xe2\x80\x9cThey are all within my body,\xe2\x80\x9d so it should be even easier to love each other.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is done through this love, this love which is not conditioned, which is not inhibited, which doesn\'t want any respite or doesn\'t want any return - nirvaaj. But the conditionings are too much. First the problem of conditioning comes to you when you think that, \xe2\x80\x9cThis condition makes me hate someone,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot love someone because this is the condition!" But actually the conditioning itself is so absurd, if you see it one by one.\xc2\xa0To make it simple, I would like you to understand the conditioning part where I read once an article, an interesting one, \xe2\x80\x9cWho killed the romance?\xe2\x80\x9d So he said \xe2\x80\x9cthe hairdressers\xe2\x80\x9d. I was wondering how is he connecting romance with the hairdressers? Because people used to go to a hairdresser and one hairdressing was liked by a person. So he would say that, \xe2\x80\x9cI love that hairdressing!\xe2\x80\x9d Now supposing his fianc\xc3\xa9e, or his wife wore another type of hairdressing, because everyday new things are coming, then immediately the husband would say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh I hate you because of your hairdressing!\xe2\x80\x9d Because he loves one type of hair dress, that\'s why he loves. Otherwise if you have another hair dress you hate it! \xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t like it!\xe2\x80\x9d To say that \xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t like it\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI like it\xe2\x80\x9d, itself, is a sign that the conditioning is too much.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You make a proper hair dress and you dress up properly and you come out and then suddenly people say, \xe2\x80\x9dOh I hate it!\xe2\x80\x9d Who are you? What right we have got to say that to anyone? You are not a judge appointed by any law courts. So why do we say, to hurt someone, to say \xe2\x80\x9cI hate it\xe2\x80\x9d? On the contrary you must say that, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright, I like this but you could do better.\xe2\x80\x9d That\'s the sign of love when you want a person to be dressed up in a way that is appealing. But this is on a very, very baser level that we see people. Then we go further to see a person: how intelligent he is, how smart he is, how charismatic he is, how charming - that\'s another word which is very elusive.\xc2\xa0These are also kind of conditionings of the mind that you think that a particular style of a person is a loveable person, that you love that person. It\xe2\x80\x99s so much outside. Or some people actually do not love but show they love because somebody has more money. And the money, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to part with, no doubt, but you love that person because he has more money, or he has a better car or he\'s better dressed, whatever it is. So this kind of an idea one has also is a killer of love. If love is killed, the joy is lost, you cannot have joy without love. I say, joy and love, both are just the same.\xc2\xa0Then it gets even subtler and subtler and subtler. Then we start loving our own children, that\'s very common. I mean, of course, also some people don\'t even love their children, I mean there are all kinds, you see. But then they go on, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my child, this is my child, this is my child!\xe2\x80\x9d That again is the death of love. As I told you before: the sap of the tree rises, goes to every fruit, goes to every leaf, goes to every part and comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s not attached. If you are attached to one part or to one flower because it is more beautiful then the tree will die and the flower will also die. So that\xe2\x80\x99s the death of the love. So you have to have love which doesn\'t get entangled or attached. Every time I tell like this they say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d The love of the Spirit is of that kind. Love of conditioned mind is different. A conditioned mind can love in a limited way because it is conditioned.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within us, which is like a balloon on top of our head. And this ego gives us a very big tension.The conditioning of course, like they see a carpet. Now it is, according to their conditioning, is not good. So they say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh what a carpet it is!\xe2\x80\x9d Or something. This kind of conditioning of very low level. And the higher level at the most, is that you love your own country, so \xe2\x80\x9cMy country is the best!\xe2\x80\x9d Whether it is killing people, whether it is destroying the world peace, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right because \xe2\x80\x9cI belong to a particular country which is the best!\xe2\x80\x9d We can never criticise our country and countrymen.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It goes on subtler and subtler. But on the intelligence side it is even worse! Because intelligently if you have understood that something is good then nobody can save you! Because through your brain you have understood. Actually it is very surprising: I was reading the book written by Rabindranath Tagore and an Englishman had given a very beautiful preface to that, an introduction, and he said that the creativity is killed in the West. So he asked a gentleman who was an Indian critic. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t you criticise your poets? You don\'t have people who are critics?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes we have, they criticise,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSo what do they criticise?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh, they can criticise that, this time there was no rain so we had problems and things.\xe2\x80\x9d He said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no, no! We are thinking about the poet, do they criticise the poet, do they criticise an artist?\xe2\x80\x9d So he says: \xe2\x80\x9cIs it meant for criticism?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cIt is created, whatever he felt is created. But supposing he has put something very vulgar then of course we don\'t like it. But if it is created by a beautiful mind, it has to be beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\'t criticise?\xe2\x80\x9d He says, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, because we cannot create like that. So what business have you got to criticise?\xe2\x80\x9dThis is how, \xe2\x80\x98intelligently\xe2\x80\x99, what we have done: we have norms about everything, about art about every creation. We don\'t like this carpet. Why? Because it doesn\'t appeal to our intellectual understanding of the norms we have reached and in that frame it doesn\'t fit in so we don\'t like it. Can you even create one inch of that?\xc2\xa0So this ego gives you an unauthorised action. It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta (\xe0\xa4\xa8\xe0\xa4\xa7\xe0\xa4\xbf\xe0\xa4\x95\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xb0 \xe0\xa4\x9a\xe0\xa5\x87\xe0\xa4\xb7\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\x9f\xe0\xa4\xbe). Un-authorised. You have no authority to criticise. You can\'t do anything, so why should you criticise? Better [to] appreciate and see for yourself that you are not in authority, you are not worthy of it, to criticise. If you are not worthy of it why should you criticise anything?\xc2\xa0And, otherwise also, you must know [that] you are a slave of your ego. Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence, so-called \xe2\x80\x98intelligence\xe2\x80\x99, brings you to a point, to have some norm. And then it becomes a collective ego of a particular community, of a particular country, of a particular ideology. It\'s collective. So then they say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh we think this is no art!\xe2\x80\x9d That is the reason we cannot have masters any more in art. We can\'t have Rembrandt, we can\'t. Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered a lot. You know Gauguin suffered a lot. All these artists suffered a lot. Even Michelangelo suffered a lot. Not only monetarily, not only monetarily, but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise. So I think people have given up.\xc2\xa0I met an artist who had done lots of art work and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\'t you show me?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo I don\'t want to show you. It\'s created for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to see!\xe2\x80\x9d I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\'t you show?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo use. People will just criticise. I do it for my own pleasure. They\xe2\x80\x99ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0So one of the basic things we should avoid is to criticise others. Better to criticise yourself. Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers and sisters, criticise your country, criticise all the habits you have and laugh at yourself, is the best way. If you know how to laugh at yourself then you will not object or will not stand in the way of any creativity of another person.\xc2\xa0So with ego you become so unauthorised. You can criticise anything. You think you have a right. Who has given you this right to criticise? Is the question one should ask to oneself. How can we criticise anyone? As saints, as you are now, of course, you can make out who is caught up, who has given bad vibrations, who has the problem. You know that. You know it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not conditioning. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just you are doing because there\'s some ego, but you are feeling it on you fingertips. It\xe2\x80\x99s an actual feeling within you. It\xe2\x80\x99s the bodha (\xe0\xa4\xac\xe0\xa5\x8b\xe0\xa4\xa7: knowledge), by which you know.\xc2\xa0Then what should you do? In your love, you have to tell the person, if possible, that, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is wrong with you. Better be corrected!\xe2\x80\x9d But in a way that he does it. On the contrary, if you tell him in a way that he becomes even worse than what it is, you have not loved that person at all.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Allow everybody to grow. There are many people in Sahaja Yoga who are very, very good, excellent, no doubt. But also there are some people whom we can call as very difficult; very! There\'s sort of a crack in their head or something, that part is missing sometimes. Some screws are loose I think. Sometimes they behave like clowns. And we have known some people. We just can\'t help them. They could be very intelligent otherwise, they could be very sharp otherwise, but in Sahaja Yoga they cannot come down to that level where you can say: now the growth is possible.\xc2\xa0Supposing the Mother Earth was very hot like the Sun, there would have been no growth. Or [if] it was cold like Moon, there would have been no growth. It had to come to the centre where it had both the things in proper proportions to grow. In the same way, a human being has to work out that you keep a moderation and a balance, and understand not to go to extremes of anything. That balance you learn when you love someone.\xc2\xa0In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, we have to ask some people to leave Sahaja Yoga. This is out of love for them, because once they go out, they improve, I have seen, they tremendously improve. But when they are inside the Sahaj Yog community they become a nuisance, and they want to be more nuisance because their ego plays the part, maybe the conditioning plays the part, whatever it is, they want to be a nuisance. So we have to ask them that, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease now, depart for a while.\xe2\x80\x9d Now if that nuisance value is lost in a person then he has to be straightforward. He cannot be any more a nuisance and logically it can appeal to a person, if you tell that person, that this is the reason why we want you to be out. But they can be very disgustingly troublesome, I know that. But you have to show complete patience and complete understanding and you must talk like a person who loves.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Love has such a power that nobody wants to do something that will suggest that they don\xe2\x80\x99t love; very powerful thing it is. It binds people in such a beautiful manner that one wants to do something: for example you want to give me flowers, because you know I love flowers. So you want to give me flower to suggest that, \xe2\x80\x9cMother we love you,\xe2\x80\x9d Just to suggest. I know you love me but you just want to, sort of, reinforce it, the thought in me. So you want to give me a flower to show your love and expression of your inner feeling for me. So all these material things can be used to express your love. They can be very easily expressed in such a manner that another person knows what is love.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the whole power of Sahastrara is love. So, if you see that, this brain has to love; brain has to love. After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga, through your brain and intelligence, if you reach a point where you understand that: No, it\'s no use analysing, synthesising, doing all these things. It\xe2\x80\x99s just love. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple love.So the same Sahastrara which has been used before, this brain, for analysing, for criticising, for doing all kinds of nonsensical things, now wants to love and enjoy the love. And there is the culmination where the brain just loves. That is the situation one has to reach. It just loves. It knows only love because it has seen the power of love. You reach a certain logical conclusion, and then you see the point. Like Adi Shankara wrote so many things like Vivekachudamani, this, that, and all those treaties, and then he gives up, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d He just writes the praise of the Mother - finished!\xc2\xa0So once you reach that point, we can say now you are in nirvikalpa because there is no vikalpa, there is no doubt in your head; because you love. In love you don\'t doubt, no question. Only when you think you doubt. But when you love you don\'t doubt, you just love, because you enjoy love. And that\'s why love is joy and joy is love.\xc2\xa0So after so many days the Sahastrara has been opened out. We have to open out our Sahastrara again: through our meditative processes, through understanding ourselves and others. Maybe logically reaching that point: there\xe2\x80\x99s no way out now. We have reached to the end of it now. The whole logic has ended up now. Jump in the ocean of love - finished!\xc2\xa0Once you jump into the ocean of love there\'s nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed - every wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of it. That is what one has to learn by reasoning that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.\xc2\xa0May God bless you all.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n'
