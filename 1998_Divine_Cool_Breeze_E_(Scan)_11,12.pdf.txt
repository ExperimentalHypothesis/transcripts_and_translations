 In this Issue: Editorial Sahasrara Day Puja 2. Shri Mataji's 75th Birthday Celebrations 12 News From Around the Worid 24 Edited by Yogi Mahajan : Vl. Nalgirkar Published by 162, Munirka Vihar New Deihi-110 067

 Editorial Looking at glass of water one may observe that 'it is half full', another may observe that 'it is half empty'. When we look at the leaner side of life we only defeat ourself, For instance if some one is asked, 'please phone Mr X' without even trying, the answer comes, "he may not be home". Even before making an attempt if people start imagining the difficulties then they create an invincible mountain by which they defeat themselves. The mental process has a ready explanation or an excuse for everything. For instance a Sahaja Yogi suggested "let us do a public programme;" pat came the reply "we may nat get the hall". We have to realise that the mental process is lenear and has to recoil back. So let us overcome it and change our outlook to saying", Of course we will get the hall, we are doing God's work." We know very well the power working behind us. Let us yoke our mental process to it and leave it to work out everything. By our imagination we block the flow of vibrations and tire ourselves. Thus we are defeated and exhausted by our own reactions. When our attention is centred there is no reaction. We can be in action and achieve many things without getting overwhelmed. The depth of our faith can cause anything to happen. Sahaja yogis have many experiences of the power of bandhan. "It was raining, we had to conduct a public programme outside. We gave a bandhan and behold the sun suddenly appeared." "It hadn't rained for a long time, the crops were drying, we gave a bandhan and it rained." Whenever Shri Mataji arrives or departs in any part of the world, the weather shows exuberance and turns favourable. Very recently at Shri Krishna Puja, Cabella in August it was very hot. There was the largest congregation of sahaja yogis. Sahaja yogis were even sleeping in the open. Therefore it was important to have dry weather. The weather cooperated till the puja was over. The next morning there was such a heavy downpour, but by then every one had left. The temperature became very pleasant and heavenly. In September, Navaratri puja, Cabella it rained throughout the music programme. But on the day of the puja the sun beamed everywhere and there was no trace of any cloud in the sky. There are many other experiences where it was very hot and Shri Mataji brought the temperature down by bringing down her right side. Thus we know very well how nature is so obedient to her. Also there are the miracle photographs and thousands of cases of healing. From these experiences our faith has grown into enlightened faith. We know that vibrations actualise into reality, our pure desires. Our confidence in the power of the paramachaitanya has become absolute. We apply its power not only to our problems but also to the problems of our society, country and the whole world. Sometimes the paramachaitanya may take its time to work out things need time to overcome negativity. We should remember that time is a human concept. Paramachaitanya is beyond time. As our brain is monitored by time we bind ourselves in time schedules and are panicky if things do not work out in those time schedules. It may However, since paramachaitanya is not bound by time it functions its own freedom. Maybe something we wish to happen tomorrow may be worked out by the paramachaitanya after ten years. For instance many things Shri Mataji told us ten years ago are happening now. Whatever paramachaitanya takes up it achieves. It always keeps its commitments but it cannot be bound by time. Whenever it performs is the right moment for that event. For the moment our job is to put our attention to world problems and pray fervently to our Divine Mother for the solutions. At our level we should continue giving bandhans and rely completely on the paramachaitanya to work it out. Our Divine Mother is the Mightiest of the mighty and even the impossible must yield to her or perish . We pray at her lotus feet and marvel at her miracles; O Devi, Let our eyes only behold the world redeemed by your miracles, Let our ears hear only your praise, Let our lips only sing Thy glory. Let our hands perform only Thy commands, Let our existence be only to please you.

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume: X Issue 11 &12 1995 Sahasrara Day Puja Pravachna (Talk) by Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi foday, it's a great day because Sahasrara Day T. must be something that Would be just a very damaging or could be very harsh, could create problems between human beings which should not have. It was not meant and Mother's Day have come together That's I Ã  very Sakaja happening, I think and that is what we have to understand, as to how Sahasrara to be but whenever they talked of truth, the people and the Motherhood go together Sahasrara was definitely opened and Mother had to do it. Because about human beings that they start using things for a formerly those people who came on this earth, tried wrong attitude, for a wrong message, and try to use to teach people about Dharma-to bring them to the it for their own purpose. It is such a common thing Central path, to the straight forward path of ascent. with human beings that they want to have power over used it for a wrong purpose. It is something special They tried everything, whatever way they thought was other men. good for a particular area, particularly community. Now, I have seen in my own country when people particular country They talked about it and lots of wanted to have separate nations. Those people who books came out of it. But instead of all these books wanted to have separate nations actually did it, not creating people of religious, spiritual and a united to achieve anything great but just because they can nature, created people who were all against each become something great in their own country. So they other Absurd! It is an absurd thing. But it happened. So all these books that were written, all this knowledge that was given, was all misused by human beings, just countries, and by separating I have seen, all these to get their own power, I should say. So it was all countries are suffering, suffering very much. There is a power oriented, also money oriented game going no growth, they have financial problem, all kinds of on When we see the outcome of all these religions, is you feel it's all empty. They talk of love, they talk of suffering because they have now developed enmity compassion but it all is for a purpose. It is all a and all this is working out against the main country political game sometimes because they still feel that So to have a separatist idea itself is against Sahaja, they should have power. Not the spiritual power, but say for example, a flower growing on the tree looks never wanted to be in a country where they may not rise to that height: So then, they separated those problems are there And also the main country the worldly power so that they can dominate the whole world So this domination started working so very nice, it develops there, matures there and it produces seeds also. But, supposing you cut the flower, and take it away, then what happens? The tree loses the flower no doubt, but mostly, it is the loss of the much in the human mind that we had lots of wars, killings. all kinds of things And when it subsided. I felt that now, may be, opening Sahasrara might help flower Now, this they did all of them and when they people to see the truth. did it you see what is the result that people who tried to have their own country, their own domain At the level of Sahasrara you know the truth. So all kinds of illusions, all kinds of misunderstandings, all kinds of self imposed ignorance, they all have to they were killed, murdered abused and some of them are o in jail So the attitude even outside Sahaja Yoga has disappear Because, what you know is the truth. The shown that it doesn't help. So we must learn to be truth is not sharp, its not harsh Ii is not something one So after Sahaja Yoga, after your Realisation, if which is difficult to assimilate. People thought iruth you do not understand this message that we all have

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume : X Issue : 11 & 12 1998 right thing to do, what is the best thing to do. But after realisation in the light of the spirit you get the truth and you know what is to be done. For example after self realization you can judge people on their to be one, one single unit, one single body, if you can not be, if you are identified with other things, then it is no way you have grown, you have not matured, very important point. vibrations. You don't have to use your brains for that. On Sahasrara Day one has to understand that all Just on your vibrations, immediately, you know what the seven chakras have their pithas in the Sahasrara. is wrong with yourself and with others. So here it is a double correction. One is you see your own midriff of your brain. And they act, through that area being, your own self, your self knowledge comes to All the seven chakras are nicely settled down in the wherever they are, on the chakras and work it out. you and secondly you can also make out another Now all these seven chakras become one I should person-what sort of a things he is doing. If somebody is not Sahaja, and claims to be Sahaja you can easily say or go into unison. Complete integration takes place in these centres. Because these are governed by find out that he is not Sahaja, his behaviour is not these seven main chakras we can call them, you can Sahaja. call them by any name, and they govern all the other chakras and because they are in unison completely integrated, that's why all your chakras are integrated, absolutely working out within ourselves. We should So best thing is for all of us, is to get this integration not shun it but we should accept that whatever defects we have, whatever wrong we have been doing, what Pithas which are enlightened I should say by Kundalini, also blessed by the Divine power immediately wrong thinking we had, whatever destructive we had become integrated. They say that like pearls in one taken to, all this has to disappear because you are Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogis have a special job to be string. It is even more than that. All these pithas within you get integrated in such a manner as if there is no done. They are not like other people, who are just difference in their manifestation. Supposing you have working for money, working for power, working for a chakra which is not alright, something wrong domination, you are not. You are working in Sahaja physically, mentally emotionally whatever it is. The Yoga for the emancipation of humanity. So whole other chakras try to help this sick chakra and try to thing is that this Sahasrara is a global field where we evolve a personality as a Sahaja Yogi in a way that enter in. We enter into a global field and when we he is integrated. Now integration within yourself is are there, we just become ourselves, a global very important. Unless and until you are integrated personality. So all these minor things like your race, your country, your religion and all these which are artificial barriers between human beings just drop out within yourself, you cannot be integrated outside And the within yourself, the integration is such a blessing of Sahaja Yoga that a person who gets this realisation becomes a personality which is above the normal personality. It is not attached to all the negative forces become a realised soul and you know what and you is humanity, you understand the humanity. This has to happen in all the Sahaja Yogis - when they are together. They should understand that we are not, no the destructive forces. It just gives up so many things which are normally very difficult to give up. All these more ordinary human beings. We are special people, seven chakras that we have within ourselves are then guided by these pithas in unison. Just the help that Cchosen for a very special work, which is the most comes from the unison, helps all the chakras to get important thing today. Now as you know what is going on in Kaliyuga. I need not describe all that to you. But what is the completely integrated. As it is we are not integrated because our mind goes on one side, our body goes on another side, our heart goes on another side, our light of the spirit which is going to show you what you can do to remove the ills of Kaliyuga. Starting right emotions are different. We do not know which is the

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume :X issue: 11& 12 1998. over Agnya, goes above and is now stationed in the Sahasrara, in thoughtless awareness. Then the reality of Sahasrara, the beauty of Sahasrara starts pouring in your own character, in your own temperament. Unless and until you meditate, not meditate just to get well or just to feel that I was meditating but meditation is very important for all of you that you develop your Sahasrara in such a manner that you imbibe the beauty of your Sahasrara. If you don't use your Sahasrara in this way, after sometime you will find, Sahasrara will close down. You will have no vibrations and you will have no understanding of yourself So very very important thing is to meditate. I can immediately make out a person who has been meditating, and the one who has not been meditating. Because a person who does not meditate still thinks that oh it's all right, am doing this, I am doing that. from yourself, you just see for yourself, with great amusement what you have been doing was all stupid You should not have done that but you have been doing, so it is alright, you can forgive others who are dong it And you will understand that those who have heen doing it, have been doing all this out of ignorance. But now you have your Sahasrara open. In the open Sahasrara divine is pouring its grace all the time. With that reception, with that, we should say the nourishing of your Sahasrara, what happens is something really great One thing happens that you get detached from yourself You can see yourself, You can see your past, you can understand yourself that you have been doing so many wrong things, and misunderstanding people: This sometimes takes you too far away from yourself But once this light comes, and the Sahasrara is nourished, in that light you see clearly what wrong Meditation is the only way you can enrich you have been coing to yourself. Then as a person you can see your faults. But also you see the faults yourself with the beauty of reality. There is no other way, I can not find any other way but of your society, where you live. I have seen immediately after people get their realisation, they start meditation by which you rise into the realm of telling me Mother I was a Christian but see this is divinity. For example, I would say, that myself whatever Christianity. Somebody will say Mother I was very I have done is this that I have been able to find out a method-how to give you Self Realisation, to masses. But that doesn't mean that if I give to masses, they are all Sahaja Yogis. No. You must have seen whenever patriotic but see now what patriotism is. Like that everybody starts seeing its own background, its own styles in which he has lived And Just gets out of it. And Once you are out of it, its no more identified you have your programmes, people get realisation when I am there and they come to programmes for a while and then they drop off The Reason is that they have not meditated. If they had meditated, they would have known, what is their quality, what are with you and it is such a spontaneous happening, only thing you have to learn to be spontaneous. And that's what I find that in Sahaja people, though they are out of this ocean of illusion, still sometimes their one leg is there in the ocean and still they are pulling it out they Without meditation you don't understand what is and pushing it back That should not be. That is only best for you. So today is a day when you have to because people don't meditate promise me that you will meditate; every night, every evening, may be in the morning also. Whenever it is possible if you can go into meditative mood, you are a kind of ritual, or may be a kind of a style of Sahaja in contact with this divine power. Then whatever Yoga No: Meditation is for you to go deep down good for you, whatever is good for your society, for into yourself, to achieve all that your Sahasrara wants your country, all is done by this divine power. You to give. To achieve that height of detachment, of don't have to overpower the divine power, you don't say you must meditate, people think it is Now to understanding is only through meditation So that have to order, you don't have to ask. Just if you happens in meditation is that your awareness crosses meditate you are one with this all pervading power.

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume : X Issue : 11 & 12 1998 complete insight, what is happening, what the truth is, about any situation. So this detachment helps, the Unless and until your Sahasrara is open, all the greatest thing of the detachment is that you are not which is another great blessings to us. blessings of the divine power cannot come to you, affected. No use saying that oh if you are not affected Mother, so how can you feel for another person, how can you have compassion for another person. Because if you feel for another person then only you can solve cannot, may be you might get some money you might get some job you might get this and that. But your own development is only possible when you meditate and your Sahasrara is completely open and open to truth. Now the truth is that this divine power is compassion, is love. This is the truth. They say God is love, God is truth. So the equation has to be made that truth is love and love is truth. But it is not a truth the problem. But this feeling that you have is again a kind of an attachment. It is not a real feeling. Because it doesn't help. The person is crying, you are also crying. The person is in trouble you are also in trouble. And this does not help that person; nor will it help you. So to have detached in no way means do not feel the another person. You do feel, you GERT that as you have for your children, you have for your family. Attached love is not truth. If you are attached you to somebody then you never see the bad points of feel the agony of that person, the trouble of that that person. If you are angry with somebody then you can never see the good points of that person. But it is a complete detached love and that love is extremely powerful. Because wherever you project never full faith in the capability of this all pervading that love to anyone, you will be surprised, the problems power. As soon as you are detached you say you do of that person will be solved, his personality will it. Finished, once you say that you are going to do improve, everything will work out in a very big way it, it is you who is going to do it - whole thing and his life will be changed. But if you are attached changes completely. Because you transfer all your to anything what so ever, that attachment itself causes responsibilities, all your problems to this divine power problems and doesn't allow Sahaja to grow. This which is so powerful which is so capable, which can attachment could be of any kind. For example you work out anything. So whenever you think that this person, of the whole society sometimes and of the whole country. But, that your feeling is so detached that the all pervading power takes over. First we must can be attached to your country, attached to your problem you are going to solve. You are the one who society, attached to your family. is going to do it then alright, Divine Power says, alright try your luck. But if you can really put this problem to the Divine power it will work out. But when Sahasrara is open you learn one thing is detachment. It just happens that you get detached. Though I mean you are not running away. As it is in Sahaja Yoga we don't believe in people, who run specially when we find that people are not so much away from society and go to Himalayas. For that I attracted to Sahaja Yoga, they are few in number, call it escapism. That is not the point, what happens then feel very bad about it. But have you tried is that you are there you see everyone, watch everyone, you know everyone, you are close to everyone but you are a detached person. It is a state of mind that worry, when we have divine power available through you achieve when Sahasrara is open. In that state, our Sahasrara. Why should we worry why should we you are dealing with people, you are dealing with think about it? Just leave it to the Divine Power. If problems, you are dealing with situations but you are that is possible if that you can achieve which is very We have all Kinds of problems in Sahaja Yoga, you to meditate on this point, and have you tried to put this problem to the divine power. Why should we not involved in it. There is no involvement and that difficult for human beings because they live with their involvement which you had before can never give you ego, they live with their conditionings. But if that

 Dlvine Cool Breeze Voluie:X Issue 11& 12 1998 leave it to this Divine Power to stop all these things happening I don't want it to rain and to have any problem till I come back home and go off to sleep. attachment to all these things goes away, then what you do is just leave things to this power. Krishna has said in His Gita, 'Sarava Dharmanam Pratyajyam Mamekam Sharnam Vaj And it was surprising, people told me, that Mother the clouds and everything were there, all throughout Forget about all but it did not rain, did not do anything and there was have a dharma of a wife, of a husband, of a member no chaos of any kind. He went to another island of the society. All of them have their own dharma. But where he had to go, he did Sahaja Yoga and came He says leave them and leave them to me and I will back. And then, when he went to sleep, then only manage. This, we have to learn, is to say that it is everything started pouring down the Divine Power which will solve our problems. As human beings its a very dificult state, and this state can only be achieved through meditation I am not saying that you go on meditating for hours together Not necessary, but with full faith in yourself and in the your dharmas Dharmas means we So nature, everything every leaf, every flower, every thing is worked out through the Divine Power So we should not have our ego that we can do something ourselves we can manage ourselves. Onee you have that kind of a thing you are not yet that much developed, you are not that much grown in Sahaja Yoga. But to grow up in Sahaja Yoga should not be difficult for you because you have guidelines. Those people who got their realisation, very few of them like sufis and we had some saints in India, how much they Divine Power, if you work it out, I am sure, it is not difficult to rise to that state of consciousness. That is what we have to achieve It is possible for men as well as for women They don't have to think how can we, Mother, do it All such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga. Those who have diffidence about nust have struggled, no body to guide them, nobody to help them, no body to tell them about what they can achieve and despite that they were very satisfied themselves can not do anything But those who are surrendered and those who are surrendered and those who think they can do it, can manage all this transfer of their power to the Divine power. Just put it on the people, very happy people. And they worked it out so well, they saw the whole world with another angle as you can also see. But they were not upset, and Now supposing I have a car which can drive they had such self confidence, they had such knowledge me down. So if I have a car, then 1 dont put of their own, that they achieved through their meditative bullocks on it. I dont push my car, I just sit inside process and the way they have written bookS, some and use it. In the same way if you heve this great of them are so great. It is very surprising now they power around you, if your Sahasrara is ahsolutely. have achieved these great verses, such full of then you will be knowledge One cannot understand that they had no amazed how things work out for yourself. I will guidance, no body was to tell them. But one thing Divine Power. completely submerged in it, give you an example of a Sahaja Yogi who is no more now. He was a fisherman, ordinary fisherman but also he was educated so he was working in a bank This Sahasrara, is the movement of your Agnya into one, was going one day to do some Sahaja Yoga thoughts. That is the only thing that stops your entry work, and he had to go by boat. So when he came into Sahaja Yoga. Thoughts are coming all the times out he saw the whole place was clouded and it was because a human being is born who reacts to about to burst out into a big havoc. So he get very everything React to this and react to that and thoughts, much perturbed about it that what is this. His Sahasrara coming and thoughts going There is a big crowd of was so open and good, immediately he said now I thoughts because of that your attention cannot cross with them was that they always tried to look after their Sahasrara. Now one thing is there, obstructing

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume : X Issue : 11 & 12 1998 transfer, to give you all the help that you need through the all pervading power. Your connection of Sahasrara with the all pervading power is established and by that you will be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you, how they help you, how they try to give you whatever is the real knowledge about everything. This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving. You can see this real knowledge in everything, you don't have to start reading any book about it. In every situation, and in every person, in every flower, in every natural happening, you see clearly the hand of the Divine. Once you see the hand of the divine, once over Agnya and cannot reside in the Sahasrara. So first of all one should see, what sort of thoughts are coming. You have to condemn yourself sometimes. You have to say what nonsense, what have I been doing, what is the matter with me, how could I do all that? Once you start doing that, these thoughts will start disappearing. These thoughts are coming from two angles- one from the ego and another from your conditionings, and these are so much built up within you, that they don't allow your agnya to be crossed. That is why we have two bija mantras of 64, TH. First one is when it is conditioning, you are endowed with this kind of fear, I should not do like this, I should not do like that, this is not allowed, that is not you say that it is you, you do everything your ego starts disappearing. Kabira has said something great about this. He said that when the Goat is alive it goes an saying I, #, #, I am, I am. But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings, which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it says 8, you are, you are, you are. See in this symbolic way, they have suggested that you have to dissolve allowed. That is the conditioning part of it. Conditioning can be of many types. But the ego part is that I must overpower everybody, I must get this, I must be able to rule everyone. These two things are there in the mind which are all the time crossing. So it is important into this divine power. It is the divine power that does everything. What am I, I was just a drop that fell into that we should go into thoughtless awareness, and that thoughtless awareness is the real way that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini. Because this ocean of awareness of the divine power and that Kundalini cannot go through, cannot pass through and for that as I said, there are two bija mantras, one is is taking over and working it out. That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi. another is &H. à¤¹à¤®, You develop curing powers but still you are not proud of it. You develop off course awakening powers So if you are conditioned, you are frightened, you are afraid and you had ideas about yourself. These days the way people are describing. They say, I am powers and you are not proud of it. You become an extrovert, somebody will say I am introvert, really very very creative, extremely creative. But the somebody will say, I am hippy. I am that, I am that, greatest thing happens to you that you become a all kinds of things they can have attributed to global personality. So you start seeing the problems themselves. But these ideas are all coming from outside, of every country, of every other nation where they you are not proud of it. You develop so many creative they are not from inside. To get to the inner side of have problems. But these problems when you see, yourself, the subtler side of your being, you must you don't see like other people because others may allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya. like to use it for their own purpose, may be for media, To cross the Agnya is a very important thing in the may be for something. What you want to see is that modern times. And for that you have to meditate. If these problems are solved. Your powers are so great you can meditate with complete faith in yourself, with this kind of a mind I would say which is this agnya can be opened up. You have to surrender dominated completely by the Divine power that yourself to the Divine and when this Agnya opens, whatever disturbs you is immediately taken over, and it starts working out. will be amazed, your Sahasrara is just waiting to you

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume : X Issue : 11 & 12 1998 You will be surprised I have got so many letters from people, how Sahaja has helped them. How, at Many problems have been solved by Sahaja Yogis, and also they can be solved on a very universal level, if you are a global person. If you are a global person the right moment they got the help at the point of then what happens is that you become sort of a complete destruction, how they were saved. So many vehicle or you can become like a channel for this people have written to me but I am not surprised because if you are one with the divine, it looks after Divine power to act because you are purely a global personality. Not attached to this, attached to that but you. It has all the powers, all the powers, only one pure Sahaja personality which can be used by this power it doesn't have, to control, if you went to ruin divine power very easily. For that as I told in the yourself it gives you freedom, complete freedom. If afternoon also that we have to be careful about few you want to ruin yourself, ruin. If you don't want to things that we have. Firstly anger, anger is the worst accept divine power, alright, don't accept. It is a thing that we have. Angry for what? There are people complete freedom to do what you like with yourself. That is one thing it has given and that is why, you must curb down that freedom and respect the divine who talk like this 'I was very angry. They are proud of their anger. Anger is a sign of complete stupidity, absolute stupidity. There is not need to get angry with power. anyone. Because by anger you don't solve the problem. With anger you spoil yourself, with anger you ruin your own nature, with anger you really spoil the whole situation. So no use having any anger-about anything But if anything happens that angers you, you should settle down and see for yourself why is it wrong, why it is disturbing you. Your seeing itself will help this Today is, I should say Mothers day also. Because I think only a mother can work it out that way, one has to have lot's of patience. What I have seen about all these great incarnations who came, they just disappeared in a very short time they lived, very short time. Somebody was crucified at about 33 years of age. Somebody took a samadhi at 23 years of age. Because problem to be solved. You must first of all, realise that I think they couldn't bear, the way the people were you are a special personality, that your Sahasrara has stupid.? They couldn't see the point that they could do been opened out, to this all pervading divine power, something for human beings. They lost their confidence as if you have entered into the realm of divinity. You I think or may be they thought it is useless to work for are a great guest, in the great court of divine domain. these people. Like that they took a position that it is You are not an ordinary person, and so once you better to disappear. But mother's position is different. understand why you have Sahaja Yoga and why you She will go on struggling and fighting for her child. She have got realisation, is that there is something special. will fight it out to the last to see that the child gets all But that should not give you any ego. It is not for the benefits, and this patience, and this love and this ego that you have to have this but it is for understanding forgiveness is innately built in a mother. Because her you have to play into the hands of the divine. It attitude is very different, not any achievement, not any that is this play, something I could explain like this that, big name or what you call a sort of an award or anything. It is just she does it because she is a Mother, and that is what is a sign of any mother, is a real Mother, at least if you are supposing an artist, then in the hand of the artist is the brush and the brush never thinks that it is doing anything. It is the artist who is doing everything. In the same way when you are one with the divine power, you just feel 1 am not doing anything. It is the artist who is doing. It is the artist who is managing & who is the artist? It is this Divine Power which for her own children she will go all out. She will work out everything, day in & day out and try to save the child from disaster. But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family and for that you really have to be worked out through the Mother's principle. You cannot take any loves you, which cares for you, which looks after you, which absolutely is identified with you. other principle.

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume X lEsue 11 & 12 1998 who are affectionate and then gradually all these complicated people will also join Your way of dealing with others has to be motherly Motherly relationship has to be there, I was surprised that in a Western literature don't find any description of a child and a mother's relationship. Very surprising There is no description at all, how the mother sees the child, how he walks, how he falls down then how he gets up, and out as warriors, then we had some who were very sacrificing, all kinds of people they had They worked very hard to establish Dharma in people. but they could not I thought of one thing that no uIse establishing dharma First of all give them realisation. When in the light of the spirit they see what is wrong they became dharmic automatically Best way is to do that, not to force dharma on them. Because you put dharma on them, they don't how he talks. All kinds of beautiful things have been described but not in the wvestern countries. I don't know, know how to bear it, they can't digest So this will be they never saw this point I think. That is very important. that to describe the attention of a mother. How she is loving, how she is kind, how she tolerates so much nonsense and how she keeps it as sort of a forgiving thing, Not just to use it against the child or to trouble. Sometimes you have to correct, you have to tell but at the right time, at a right place if they are told the child also sees the point whatever is there the best way, is to just make them aware of their spirit. Once the light of the spirit comes, in the light they see everything clearly then no problem is there and that's why this Mother's quality is very helpful. I mean in every country there has been a manifestation of the Mother's principle, in every country, and it has been depicted and said, but later on it was taken over by people who didn't want to talk about Mother. Because they could not justify themselves, the way they were behaving. So they said best is not to talk of the Mother The first most convincing thing is the affection and the love of the Mother She goes on forgiving and giving that assurance that I have a mother. Nothing can happen Also those who are very much advanced people, very mature, who were really incamations did talk about and this assurance works very well. But the same the Mother all the time but still talk was talk Now this assurance you have to give to other Sahaja Yogis who has to be worked out as a Mother has to do So in are getting realisation from you Let them feel that you your own way when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there are not angry with them. They are stupid I know, they also you have to be a Mother More Mother's quality are sometimes violent, I have gone through all kinds of then the Father's quality. That there is no ambition, people. But the only thing that has worked is pure love, there is no competition, there is no jealousy, nothing pure love has no attributes of expecting something You Just you want your children to come up and to grow in Just give love & try to improve that person with full their spirituality If that is the only attitude we have then attention But in divine work you don't have to get you will be amazed how satisfied you will feel because attached to that person. this is a very very joy giving thing to see people growing in spirituality. Not only talking about it, not only reading point, is also troublesome, gets angry with you, annoys about it, but actually happening, actualizing within you and insults you, so forgot it, there are many others. yourself. So this quality is very helpful and that really There is no need to run after one person, to get attached helps every Sahaja Yogi - to be patient, to be kind, to be humble but you have to correct also. There is a way Sahaja Yogis always feel that I am their own which is of correction of another person, of people who are a fact whether I talk to you whether I meet you or coming not from the divine world but from the normal whatever it is, you have to know that I am your Mother world. So it's a difficult task to correct them. Some And any problem you have you can always tell me. But people are so hot tempered they can't bear it Doesn't sometimes the way people tell me problems also. I fel matter, you have to forgive them. But best is to how low they are. Their mentality is so low, what are concentrate on people, who are simple, who are loving. they asking me. Supposing you go to some king and Supposing, there is somebody who is not up to the to that person. Now main thing is that I feel all the

 10 Divine Cool Breeze Volume :X issue 11 & 12 1998 ask him, say, for half a dollar. What will the king say, well. what is the matter with this person. He doesn't know, what he should for? In the same way, one feels that is growing, and you are part and parcel of that society way that when you are asking anything to your Mother, which is Sahaja Yoga. It is a very rare society, which it should be of some value. Some great value, it should they never had. They had one or two sufis here and have the value of complete satisfaction When you ask there, one or two realised souls here and there, who It is what we have to think globally that Sahaja Yoga for something it should give you complete satisfaction only suffered. All their lives they were tortured. No But I have seen people asking for this thing, for that body looked at them. I had great hopes about thing I mean it is to such an extent that sometimesI Maharashtra but I was so disappointed because they feel, oh God, how am I getting all these people around me, who are desiring something very low, very mean, very insignificant. But if you are one with the Sahasrara. then Sahasrara itself works. It will bring you in contact with such people that you are amazed, how it works? I went to Turkey and my experience of Turkey has proved that beyond doubt. I never expected but the Turkish people of all the people of the world have taken to Sahaja Yoga just like a windfall, can't understand, how they have accepted, and they were at least 2000 people in the follow up and people were finding it impossible to get them around and tell them. And when they had very close meetings also they had so many people, and they continue to be there. Now, may be that it is a very disturbed country, with fundamentalism tortured all these great saints, all throughout, so badly, in such a mean manner that I think they are still paying for it. And despite the fact that I have done so much for them, what I feel is that their Karmas are not good because they still, I would say, it is a rotten country It t has become so rotten. You can see that the way people are behaving, whole thing is so bad. Though Sahaja Yoga is there, no doubt but I would not say it is of that level as it is in the North, North of India. Very surprising, North Indians never know anything about Sahaja Yoga. They were not such religious people either, but how the North people have taken to Sahaja Yoga is very surprising. So you can't say where the light will show. Just can't say, and wherever it shows we should accept. Where it doesn't show, we should not feel bad about very much working out. it What can you do? You can not, sort of, break their heads for Sahasrara. Their Sahasrara has to be opened out and with your motherly love, with your motherly understanding I am sure you can do it. May not be, to the same extent in every country but I am sure I feel that may be the 'punayas" of these great saints will work. And may be where I felt little bit disappointed, I feel that all these places will work out and Sahaja But everywhere, every country has problems and has, you should say, a kind of very destructive image- every country has. But in some countries I do not know how it sparks, and once they become Sahaja Yogis, no problem. There is no problem about anything if they are Sahaja Yogis. You see you don't have to tell them. They themselves work it out. They understand it, what Yoga will grow. But first and foremost is your Sahasrara. Only your Sahasrara can reflect the light of divine. So your Saharara is extremely important. You must meditate to enrich your Sahasrara, to cure it, to make it completely nourished by the Kundalini. There is no need to do is it? Like we have every country which has problems. which has people who are not of a very great level, who are not great seekers. May be in some countries. I feel those who were great seekers are lost. Like England I feel that all the seekers are lost by drugs. hippism, all nonsense America is the worst of all which many rituals but meditation and also little bit of taking bandhan, even now, today is necessary I think when you go out because still Kaliyuga is working its own is so much lost into wrong seeking and it is difficult to find people there who have right seeking. Gradually it is working out, but still I must say, we should not think pangs and the Satyayuga is trying to come up. We are the ones who are going to support, look after the of any one particular country where Sahaja Yoga is not working out so much or in some places working out so Satyauga and that is why Sahasrara opening is very,

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume X issue 11 & 12 1998 The first group of speakers were Western leaders who spoke of their love for Shri Mataji. As one said, it was like being a grain of sand standing before Mount Kailasha Shri Mataji has shown us the path to Heaven within our heart. Another said that She has collective, accommodating all facets of each others' personality They possess a beautiful and natural affection for each other which allows them to avoid the disputes one normally sees between young children They live day by day within a natural and spontaneous universal brotherhood, united in their Sahaja collectivity They teach us that the things that divide us are an illusion, and the most important union we have beyond that with Shri Mataji is with each other. Shri Mataji once said our children would be teaching us how Sahaja Yoga should be freed us of our confines and has brought lasting peace words being inadequate to express our feelings of love and gratitude, but with a humble heart we bow before .

Shri Mataji arrived to find the pendal absolutely full, with hundreds of people standing along the outer Those of us who were sitting close to the stage were able to notice the amazement and awe in the perimeter of the pendal and large crowds outside unable to gain entry. faces of these politicians and dignitaries while the Sahaja Yogis were speaking These dignitaries were Many prominent Indian politicians and citizens were all very deeply touched to see the miracle of people invited to speak, as well as several of the country from all over the world being so united, without regard leaders in Sahaja Yoga.

An Tonger binds us, and we become responsible for the present moment Then Dharmateet, beyond human expectant air hung around the camp as we prepared for Puja It seemed most appropriate that the maximum nature, beyond dharma, meaning we are not bound to any particular pattern, or ritual, entering that awareness number of people possible would gather to celebrate the 75th Birthday Puja. where all solutions arise.

A match the collective desire of those wishing to be realized soul sees himself, what is wrong, and knows Shri Mataji went on to say that a Sahaja Yogi is present. By 6 p.m the pendal was completely fÃ¼ll with thousands of people still queuing to gain entry. The when to correct himself In Sahaja Yoga we have become the spirit and then everything changes. our audience was continually nsked to move forward to genes change, we become people who know joy, can extract all available space to accommodate those still outside Crammed to bursting in the hot, hot pendal no question of big bags placed out on either side- give joy, and who enjoy the company of others. Then we can live anywhere, sleep anywhere, beeause our everyone with a shawl, a bottle of water, and their spirit is always with us to give happiness. Then we knees up to their chest We waited for a miraculous become one with all Sahaja Yogis, crossing the extension of the pendal, which did not materialize By boundary which stops one from seeing the truth. 7 p.m. the pendal was fill like never before, with over seven thousand people inside, and a further three sari held up by seven ladies.

Balloons were popped with great gusto on all sides of the pendal, in a collective effort to symbolize The flags were presented to Shri Mataji before the commencement of the Puja Shri Mataji asked that these flags be carried back to their countries with the message that the time has come for our resurrection. the deflating of the Ego. At the conclusion of the puja, the international gift was presenteda very large oil painting (large enough to fill an entire wall, like a mural) with large figures of Shiva and Parvati in the centre, surrounded. by small scenes depicting stories of Shiva.

Looking at glass of water one may observe that 'it is half full', another may observe that 'it is half
empty'. When we look at the leaner side of life we only defeat ourself, For instance if some one
is asked, 'please phone Mr X' without even trying, the answer comes, "he may not be home". Even
before making an attempt if people start imagining the difficulties then they create an invincible mountain
by which they defeat themselves. The mental process has a ready explanation or an excuse for
everything. For instance a Sahaja Yogi suggested "let us do a public programme;" pat came the reply
"we may nat get the hall". We have to realise that the mental process is lenear and has to recoil
back. So let us overcome it and change our outlook to saying", Of course we will get the hall, we
are doing God's work."
We know very well the power working behind us. Let us yoke our mental process to it and leave
it to work out everything. By our imagination we block the flow of vibrations and tire ourselves. Thus
we are defeated and exhausted by our own reactions. When our attention is centred there is no
reaction. We can be in action and achieve many things without getting overwhelmed.
The depth of our faith can cause anything to happen. Sahaja yogis have many experiences of the
power of bandhan. "It was raining, we had to conduct a public programme outside. We gave a bandhan
and behold the sun suddenly appeared." "It hadn't rained for a long time, the crops were drying, we
gave a bandhan and it rained." Whenever Shri Mataji arrives or departs in any part of the world, the
weather shows exuberance and turns favourable. Very recently at Shri Krishna Puja, Cabella in August
it was very hot. There was the largest congregation of sahaja yogis. Sahaja yogis were even sleeping
in the open. Therefore it was important to have dry weather. The weather cooperated till the puja was
over. The next morning there was such a heavy downpour, but by then every one had left. The
temperature became very pleasant and heavenly. In September, Navaratri puja, Cabella it rained
throughout the music programme. But on the day of the puja the sun beamed everywhere and there
was no trace of any cloud in the sky. There are many other experiences where it was very hot and
Shri Mataji brought the temperature down by bringing down her right side. Thus we know very well
how nature is so obedient to her. Also there are the miracle photographs and thousands of cases
of healing. From these experiences our faith has grown into enlightened faith. We know that vibrations
actualise into reality, our pure desires. Our confidence in the power of the paramachaitanya has become
absolute. We apply its power not only to our problems but also to the problems of our society, country
and the whole world. Sometimes the paramachaitanya may take its time to work out things
need time to overcome negativity. We should remember that time is a human concept. Paramachaitanya
is beyond time. As our brain is monitored by time we bind ourselves in time schedules and are panicky
if things do not work out in those time schedules.
It may
However, since paramachaitanya is not bound by time it functions its own freedom. Maybe
something we wish to happen tomorrow may be worked out by the paramachaitanya after ten years.
For instance many things Shri Mataji told us ten years ago are happening now. Whatever paramachaitanya
takes up it achieves. It always keeps its commitments but it cannot be bound by time. Whenever it
performs is the right moment for that event.
For the moment our job is to put our attention to world problems and pray fervently to our Divine
Mother for the solutions. At our level we should continue giving bandhans and rely completely on the
paramachaitanya to work it out. Our Divine Mother is the Mightiest of the mighty and even the
impossible must yield to her or perish . We pray at her lotus feet and marvel at her miracles;
O Devi, Let our eyes only behold the world redeemed by your miracles, Let our ears hear only
your praise,
Let our lips only sing Thy glory.
Let our hands perform only Thy commands,
Let our existence be only to please you.

You have to say what nonsense, what have I been
doing, what is the matter with me, how could I do
all that? Once you start doing that, these thoughts will
start disappearing. These thoughts are coming from
two angles- one from the ego and another from your
conditionings, and these are so much built up within
you, that they don't allow your agnya to be crossed.
That is why we have two bija mantras of 64, TH.
First one is when it is conditioning, you are endowed
with this kind of fear, I should not do like this, I
should not do like that, this is not allowed, that is not

about this. He said that when the Goat is alive it goes

slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings,
which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it says

way, they have suggested that you have to dissolve
allowed. That is the conditioning part of it. Conditioning
can be of many types. But the ego part is that I must
overpower everybody, I must get this, I must be able
to rule everyone. These two things are there in the
mind which are all the time crossing. So it is important

everything. What am I, I was just a drop that fell into

thoughtless awareness is the real way that your
Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini. Because
this ocean of awareness of the divine power and that

They were not such religious people either, but how the
