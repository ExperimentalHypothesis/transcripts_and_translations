Welcome Puja Talk, Madrid, Spain, 22d of May, 1986

May God bless you all. Oh! Beautiful. You are all already here. You arrived by some other side or what? You cam, Mark? [Shri Mataji is laughing]

Mark: Yes.

Shri Mataji: You're quite in time. We were worried about you they are going to do the same to you

Mark: Really?

Shri Mataji: Because they didn't inform about us correctly so I was wondering whether they are going to do the same to you.

Sit down, sit down, please.

How did you enjoy the Sahasrara day? Sahasrara surrounded by snow! [Shri Mataji is laughing] Tremendous it was! Snow. Do you get snow here?

Do they get snow here? I don't think so. But you saw the Pyrenees on the way?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: All full of snow, yes. Sorry.

How much time you took to come, Mark?

Mark: About sixteen hours.

Shri Mataji: Sixteen hours. But it was comfortable.

Mark: Yes.

Shri Mataji: It was a French train or a?

Mark: Yes it was a French train.

Shri Mataji: French.

Mark: For some parts [inaudible].

Shri Mataji: You had to change.

Mark: No, I just change gate [inaudible]. It's not much.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. But you were in the same compartment they got down.

Mark: No.

[To the ladies] It's good.

Nice vibrations.

Sahaja Yogini: Very, very beautiful.

Shri Mataji: Yes.

We're worried really about you because the way they had informed, we were wondering what was happening.

Sahasrara Day, it must be quite an experience for you to go in that snow! [Shri Mataji is laughing]

It’s a wonderful place.

Hello Avya! You are here! So nice to see you, really so very nice to see you.

How did you come?

Sahaja Yogi: [in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Good, very good. Very happy you could come here. Oh, that’s fine.

I was just now talking about Italian's Sahasrara Day. It was such an experience for every one of them were so deep, so deep.

And all these people that had come! That gave them very great hope and very great joy.

Very happy to see you here, I didn’t know you would be coming. [Shri Mataji is laughing] Such a pleasure. Guido has come, had come.

Sahaja Yogi: To Paris?

Shri Mataji: To Paris, yes. And we had a very, very successful programme there, very successful. Lots of people came, the whole hall was filled. And when I asked them: “If you want to go, you can go, I cannot force on you.” So, they just smiled. Nobody left. But I then, later on, said that those who suffer from epilepsy should go, then three, four people went out. Because epileptic people get defeat [unsure] sometimes.

Good, Maricruz is having lots of vibrations.

So now, what subjects should we talk to them? We have to decide on that, on what subject.

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible] How you always program.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: The same as you usually do.

Shri Mataji: Usual introduction.

Sahaja Yogi: No, he will give the introduction.

Shri Mataji: All right. So, as the usual, I should say.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Because there will be mostly new people now.

Sahaja Yogi: Three people.

Shri Mataji: There will be mostly new people coming. Or the same?

Sahaja Yogi: I don't know if they know you, perhaps, yes.

Shri Mataji: Perhaps it might be the repeaters.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, maybe. Neetlam, Neetlam will give the basic introduction.

Shri Mataji: Ah.

Sahaja Yogi: He wants to do the program after you?

Shri Mataji: No, he should, you see, what they did was to little bit, tell about Me. And second day Gregoire told them about the chakras. But first day, he told about Me, then I started off with the Kundalini, what it is, what it does and all that. And second day, because Gregoire got about half an hour to tell about the chakras and the nadhis, I talked about the sat-chit-ananda state of the Spirit. So, that turned out to be very good. 

And if you think it proper, then first day, I can talk about the general thing like an introduction to Sahaja Yoga. The second day, I can talk about sat-chit-ananda, it would be a better idea.

Or else, in Italy, as it happened that Guido had one hour because there was some demonstration so we reached late. So Guido talked about the whole thing, practically he touched every point and he told Me: "Mother I have told them everything." So I said: "All right". So I started all the way round, describing what goes wrong, how our awareness goes down. It was such a lengthy lecture but everybody was silently listening and was very good.

And that Milano fellow, do you remember? The one who met us, that director. He is now going to have some sort of a -I don’t know what- meeting with very- patient people.

Sahaja Yogi: It's the most important people of here in Italy.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: It is a programme for all television channels meeting, and the main newspaper “Correo della Sera” organising one day for each day very important person interview and have set a programme for the “Grande Madre”.

Shri Mataji: That’s my name then, “Grande Madre”

[To the children] Very happy.

Let's keep the Spanish Sahaja Yogis.

May God bless you.

May God bless you. Wonderful. Wonderful children. You're getting the cool breeze? Are they getting the cool breeze in the hands?

Lot of it.

In France also, in Paris, the vibrations were so great that some of them started saying: ”Ventilator is open, it's the ventilator open somewhere.”

[Shri Mataji is laughing]

But they were very bad, you know, in the beginning, such a lot of heat from their bad livers! And I was perspiring and perspiring and perspiring. Such heat! I said: "What to do with this heat?" Then after the lecture, I sat down for two minutes, I said: "Let the heat come down a little bit". Too much heat I absorbed.

I was perspiring, bathing in absolutely perspiration. And then, it cooled down. They got Realization. First day, at least 60 person got, then second day, most of them got it.

Shri Mataji: How is Alganesh? As she was sick that time.

Sahaja Yogi: She little bit shoebeat.

Shri Mataji: She still has?

Sahaja Yogi: No, no, no.

Shri Mataji: She's alright now?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, she is. I have shoes, tennis shoes for you [unsure]

Shri Mataji: She sent shoes with you?

[Shri Mataji is laughing]

Sahaja Yogi: Yesterday in Milano, the program, was made by my wife and Alganesh.

Shri Mataji: Then?

Sahaja Yogi: Alganesh and Sylvana my wife, they had-

Shri Mataji: How many you had? For follow-up.

Sahaja Yogi: We had for follow-up, forty people. It’s going very good, beautiful nice people.

Shri Mataji: Good.

Sahaja Yogi: Beautiful.

Shri Mataji: Very good. 40 people is very good.

Sahaja Yogi: Guido is going now to Milano.

Shri Mataji: Yes, last night he told Me. I ́m very happy. Guido is doing very well.
