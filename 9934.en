Welcome Puja Talk, Madrid, Spain, 22d of May, 1986

May God bless you. May God bless you. Oh! Beautiful. You are all already here. You arrived by some other side or what? Please be seated. You came, Mark? [Shri Mataji is laughing]
Mark: Yes.
Shri Mataji: You're quite in time. We were worried about you. Because they didn't inform about us correctly. So, I was wondering whether they are going to do the same to you.
Mark: We will work it out.
Shri Mataji: That’s good.

Sit down, sit down. Please, be seated.
How did you enjoy the Sahasrara day? Sahasrara surrounded by snow! [Shri Mataji is laughing] Tremendous it was! Snow. Do you get snow here?
[Two ladies washing the feet of Shri Mataji]
Do they get snow here? I don't think so. But we saw the Pyrenees on the way.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: All full of snow, yes. I saw it.

How much time you took to come, Mark?
Mark: About sixteen hours.
Shri Mataji: Sixteen hours. But it was comfortable?
Mark: Yes.
Shri Mataji: It was a French train or a?
Mark: Yes, Mother. It was a French train.
Shri Mataji: French.
Mark: Actually, there were some parts from other countries.
Shri Mataji: You had to change.
Mark: No, they just changed the gauge of the wheels to match the Spanish ones.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. But you were in the same compartment, never got down.
Mark: No.

[To the ladies] It's good.
Nice vibrations.
Sahaja Yogini: Very, very beautiful.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

We were worried really about you, because the way they had informed, we were wondering what must be happening.

Sahasrara Day, it must be quite an experience for you to go in that snow, isn't it? [Shri Mataji is laughing]
It’s a wonderful place. Hello Avya! You are here! So nice to see you, really so very nice to see you. How did you come?
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Good, very good. Very happy you could come here. Oh, that’s fine.
I was just now talking about Italian's Sahasrara Day. It was such an experience, for every one of them were so deep, so deep. And all these people that had come! That gave them very great hope and very great joy.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Very happy to see you here, I didn’t know you would be coming. [Shri Mataji is laughing] Such a pleasure. Guido has come, had come -
Sahaja Yogi: To Paris?
Shri Mataji: To Paris, yes.
And we had a very, very successful programme there, very successful. Lots of people came, the whole hall was filled. And when I asked them, “If you want to go, you can go, I cannot force on you”. So, they just smiled. Nobody left.
But I then, later on, said that those who suffer from epilepsy should go. Then three, four people went away. Because epileptic people get the fit sometimes.
[A Sahaja Yogini is drying Shri Mataji’s feet].

It’s good.
Maricruz is having lots of vibrations. [Shri Mataji is laughing]

So now, what subjects should we talk to them? We have to decide on that, on what subject.
Sahaja Yogi: How you always talk, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: The same as you usually talk, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Usual. Introduction.
Sahaja Yogi: No, he will give the introduction.
Shri Mataji: All right. So, as the usual, I should say.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Because there will be mostly new people now.
Sahaja Yogi: New people.
Shri Mataji: There will be mostly new people coming. Or the same?
Sahaja Yogi: I don't know, I don’t know. Perhaps, yes.
Shri Mataji: Perhaps it might be the repeaters.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, maybe, Mother. He can, he can give the basic introduction.
Shri Mataji: Ah.
Sahaja Yogi: If you want to talk about something else.
Shri Mataji: No, he should, you see, what they did was to little bit tell about Me.
And second day, Gregoire told them about the chakras. But first day, he told about Me, then I started off with the Kundalini, what it is, what it does and all that. And second day, because Gregoire got about half an hour to tell about the chakras and the nadis, I talked about the ‘sat-chit-ananda’ state of the Spirit. So, that turned out to be very good.
And if you think it proper, then first day, I can talk about the general things like an introduction to Sahaja Yoga. The second day, I can talk about ‘sat-chit-ananda’, it would be a better idea.

Or else, in Italy, as it happened that Guido had one hour because there was some demonstration, so we reached late. So, Guido talked about the whole thing, practically he touched every point and he told Me, "Mother I have told them everything." So, I said, "All right". So, I started all the way round, describing what goes wrong, how our awareness goes down. It was such a lengthy lecture but everybody was silently listening and was very good.

And that Milano fellow, do you remember? The one who met us, that director. He is now going to have some sort of a - I don’t know what- meeting with very special people.
Sahaja Yogi: It's the most important people of the year in Italy.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: It's a program for all television channels in Italy, in the main newspaper, 'Corriere della Serra', organizing one day for each very high, very important person in Italy, one day for interview. And they have decided of course, that “Grande Madre” is the-
Shri Mataji: That’s my name then, “Grande Madre”.

[To the children] Very happy. Vey nice, very nice. You keep the Spanish Sahaja Yogis.
May God bless you.
May God bless you. Wonderful. Wonderful children. You're getting the cool breeze? Are they getting the cool breeze in the hands?
[Children say ‘yes’.]
Shri Mataji: Lot of it. Nice

In France also, in Paris, the vibrations were so great that some of them started saying, ”Ventilator is open, is the ventilator open somewhere? Ventilator?”
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

But they were very bad, you know, in the beginning, such a lot of heat from their bad livers! And I was perspiring and perspiring and perspiring. Such heat! I said, "What to do with this heat?" Then after the lecture, I sat down for two minutes, I said, "Let the heat come down a little bit". Too much heat I absorbed.
I was perspiring, bathing in, absolutely in perspiration. And then, it cooled down. They got Realization. First day at least sixty percent got and second day, most of them got it.

Shri Mataji: How is Alganesh? She was sick that time.
Sahaja Yogi: She had little bit of Vishudhi.
Shri Mataji: She still has?
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, no, immediately.
Shri Mataji: She's alright now?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, she is. I have shoes, she sent me shoes for you.
Shri Mataji: She sent shoes with you?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

Sahaja Yogi: And yesterday in Milano, the program, had been made by my wife and Alganesh.
Shri Mataji: Then?
Sahaja Yogi: Alganesh and Sylvana my wife, they have-
Shri Mataji: How many you had? For follow-up.
Sahaja Yogi: We had for follow-up, forty people more or less now.
Shri Mataji: It’s good.
Sahaja Yogi: Going very deeply, Mother. Beautiful nice people, nice.
Shri Mataji: It’s very good. 40 people is very good.
Sahaja Yogi: Guido is going now to-
Shri Mataji: Yes, last night he told Me. I ́m very happy. Guido is doing very well.

I think we need some sensible people to go to France now. We have some nice people coming up. But they are all little boys, you see, like Patrick is a boy and another. We need some serious elderly people there to guide. So, I was thinking who can go and help them there, with the French language. Michel is there, but he is pestered by his wife. So he’s so fed up.
Let us see.

The good news is that, most probably, the house that we are trying to purchase in London will be done now. So, it's something good and there we are going to get the small children in a school-like thing, from next year.

Juan, I would like to rest for a while.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: That would be better because last night till three o'clock, they were discussing. And we slept after that. So, you can imagine.
Sahaja Yogi: Would you like a cup of tea, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Oh, not necessarily I'll have my sleep and then we'll have it.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Some water I'll have, I think.

In Spain, you need more water as you need in India, I see. And less of tea. Already, it's quite warm for you.

September, that would have been better for Me to come here. But when we thought I have to go all the way to Los Angeles, and then come back to London, then go to India, then to Australia, it would have been too much. So it's better to go from Los Angeles to Australia, and then to India.

I'm in my eighties now, I'm sixty-four and the amount of travelling I’m doing [Shri Mataji is laughing].
So much travelling all the time. All right. Somehow, I managed somehow. Even normally, if you travel so much one may go crazy. But I think, when I give Realization to people the whole thing gets compensated. You just feel so happy. And all your fatigue, everything, disappears into thin air.

Let [unclear] at a rest.
Thank you.
