Talk to Yogis. Mumbai (India), 20 January 1975.

[Translation from Hindi to English]

In Kali Yuga, there is no greater method than forgiveness. The larger the power of forgiveness, the more powerful you will be. Forgive everyone. Only the one who is big can forgive. What can a small minded person forgive?

I had said this morning to know the Dharma. Know the Dharma that is within you. You are standing in Dharma. The one who is standing in Dharma has such tremendous powers within. Know this Dharma. Aah! It is so beautiful, those who are standing in Dharma. The one who is standing on Adharma we do not have a competition with him. We are standing in Dharma. Our ways are different. The one who is standing in Dharma his method is different from the one who is standing in Adharma. The one who is standing in Dharma cannot have any accord with one who is standing in Adharma. We are having problems, discomforts but we are standing in our Dharma. It is the greatest thing. Know your Powers within which is only based on Dharma.

And Dharma is nothing but love. And if love is everything then forgiveness becomes its part. How much can a person commit atrocities by seeing our love? How much evil can a person do? How much can another trouble you, upset you? Let them. Everything will be washed away with love. This is the only way in Kali Yuga that works out. I can't understand any other way. If you think that there should be some old methods to use then it is not possible.

There is only one reason which I have told you before and I am telling you again that there are no complete saints or sadhus in this world. In each sadhu, they have sent one, one rakshasa. They must have gone into your attention. Have you understood? If it is some sadhu then its all right. "Paritraya Sadhunam vinashaya cha duskritaam" ( for the redemption of the saints and the destruction of the devils). But if with the sadhu there is the devil sitting inside then he will have to be removed with a lot of love, isn’t it? What a difficult work this is! You are standing in the saintly position and there is also the devil within. But if you are standing as a saint and there is a devil within, you can remove it. But tell me how many pure souls are there in this world? It’s a difference of degrees. And those who are going towards sainthood should collect saintliness. They should have nothing to do with those who are not saintly. They are unsaintly, thieves and bilanders! What comparison with them? They are thieves and we cannot be them, they cannot be us. It just cannot be. They are moving on another line and we moving on another line.

To rise in Dharma is the aim of Sahaja Yoga. There is no other aim. It is a straight calculation. Sahaja Yoga has nothing to do with any of these things. You have to be awakened in your own Dharma, you have you get your own light and to know yourself. Someone says, "Mataji, what to do? My chakra is caught this way, this or that has happened." To move them this way or that are all primordial movements, which I am telling you. "Adi gati", Primordial movements, primordial. These have been made. But to make it flow in a pure manner....if there are mixed things within then when you move your hands then it is moving mixed.

Without forgiveness, purity cannot come within. When purity will come then the light of Dharma will be spread...Pure and Nirmal. Means the one who has Dharma will have to come into the light. Will have to talk about it, speak about it. But he should note in his own behavior whether he is seeing Dharma or Adharma. If I had given you a lecture before Realization, it would have been very wrong because it is a conditioning and that is the reason that all psychologists have finished the dharma. They teach that whatever Dharma, they teach don’t do this , don’t do that. So, the mind gets conditioned.

But now this will not happen. Now whatever you want from the mind you can do. There will be no conditioning at all. Because I have taken your chitta and put it between ego and super- ego. Dharma is rising by itself and you have done that. You have found its way. And whatever worldly things you have known...that it is like this or that in the world, with that you cannot measure the Divine. You cannot join the value of Divine with that. I am talking about Divine and you are joined to the worldly. The three dimensions of worldliness have finished. Those who want to move to the fourth dimension with seriousness and depth... I am talking about the fourth dimension... You cannot know the value of the Divine through worldly things.

What or how have we been troubled? Not at all troubled... I say that we are very comfortable. The way I have seen difficulties and seen people in terrible difficulties and you will not find their descriptions also. These are such super rascals and such descriptions I cant explain. But the state of society is much better now. And even your state is very good. But you must not deceive and cheat yourself. It is a straight calculation.  Whatever you are doing with Sahaja Yoga you are doing with yourself.

Now this question arises many times in administration. Such a question arises that what should we do? Is this correct or not. But this is so easy, so easy that before taking any decision go into Thoughtlessness. Whatever decision comes in front do that. That can never be wrong. But the decision will be spontaneous in thoughtlessness. And if you took that decision in thought then it will be biased because your ego and super ego both will work in that. Whatever are your "samskaras", or worldly things you have earned will be standing behind you. But if you do it in thoughtlessness then it will be an "abhinav", Divine, a miracle. A miracle. So, when I am talking about Divinity then whatever worldly created ideas - pre-conceived ideas of human beings cannot guide God. You must know that. He has His own standing and His own Being. If you desire that God becomes like you then it is similar to the one who sells God for four rupees and says I will place him there. You will reach that level. He will as He is give Light and you keep seeking your path.You must know your Dharma within. To know your Dharma is very necessary, as to what a beautiful thing has been placed in you. In this destructible body what an indestructible thing is flowing. Just like a confluence of the three rivers, Ganga, Saraswati and Yamuna.  Its stream is flowing. You cannot know this thing with the destructible within, or that which is worldly. For a second, go into thoughtlessness and when you take decisions, you will take such decisions which is not in the likes of many- dynamic! Absolutely dynamic! Then worry, fear, anger, servility, slavishness, inferiority and all complexes will all fall away. He will speak in his grandeur. He has his own humility. Because he is so gentle, so gentle and delicate, that it is impossible to know how he came in. Just like the moonlight came in.

So, now that you have been chosen then your importance is very great. Now you maybe thinking that I am such an ordinary person, how come I have been chosen?  The choosing will be among ordinary people only. And these very, very great people whom you see in this world who are highly awarded, they will all become missing links. It has always happened. In every stage of evolution this has happened you have seen. All those who were great mammoths, became over developed physically, they are all finished. They were missing links. Only the elephant got saved. In the same way those who were over-developed mentally they are now coming like the fox. And from those also there are much more developed. But from them the dog got saved. In the same way it is in the humans who will rise from the ordinary. This has always happened that it has risen from the ordinary. And the so called extraordinary who are the third dimension, they are not going to do anything. They will become the missing links in the evolution stage. People will not know them as they don’t know that the chimpanzee was a missing link.

In evolution only ordinary people will be chosen. One has to be normal. All these big Sanyasis who are roaming are not going to reach anywhere, you will see. They will all go into the missing link. And these highly awarded- I have given Realization to all these kings, secretaries, but to what avail? They are all sitting on their positions. Do they feel that why the light should be lit within us? They write to me that I am feeling great joy... Do they think of doing something about this? That we have got it and should share it? When you have a special place then you have to be special too. From this ordinary only will the extraordinary come out. Only that will blossom. Slowly, you yourself will understand that they all are extremely foolish; who can talk to them?  They might be big doctors, so what? They are just sitting. They have done nothing of value.

Our position is very high. For this you cannot be educated. There can be no education that I am going to teach you A B C D. This is to be experienced with your daily experience. This morning I had told you something very great that in Sahaja Yoga you are a part of the whole, not of the individual, but the whole. Know this point.

Gagangiri Maharaj is very great. At a much higher position than you people, let us assume. But for twenty-on thousand years he was just going around in circles, poor man. Where did it happen spontaneously. He took rebirths twenty-one thousand times, kept falling at the feet of God and lived in jungles then only did he get these vibrations. And now how come you are getting it so easily? Because this is a new world. It is a new thing. You are the parts of this body of the Virata. He was made a symbolic man. But you are all in the Collective. The one who wants to get out of the collective he must know that he will become cancer and be destroyed. None of you is good or bad. One finger pains and the other finger will press it. If this hand pains the other will press it. You are all joined together. You know that. When you can share your badhas, then why cant you share your wealth? You catch badhas immediately, but why not wealth? The entire reason is this that at the moment we are just walking. You are still very little children. We are going to burn ourselves, fall down a bit. One day when you grow up you will take the hands of thousands and make them walk. If you get cheated, doesn’t matter. You are little. Come into innocence. But those who are cheating and thinking that they are very clever must know that they will be removed like cancer.There is another way too, where the one who goes never returns. But there is also a way to hell. Lot of people walk on that way. They think that to come in front of Mataji, touch Her feet, wash Her feet means they are great Sahaja Yogis. This way is also moving alongside. When the flower blossoms then anything that has to fall off the bud falls out and breaks and the fragrance comes out of that. That which has to grow, grows; and that which has to fall, falls. They both move together. Life is like that. That which has to grow, life will make it and the one that has to die, life will finish it. But there is a time for its storing and they go too. And some go in such a way and they never return.

From the animal state you become humans and what is the use that you become insects after the human birth. Your competition should be on Dharma. Are we in Dharma or not? Think like this for yourselves and about others think that how deep are they in Dharma. And if they are in Adharma then why are they so? What chakra of theirs is catching? Look at it without expectations. Its only a chakra catching? Then you can remove it by just sitting here by your desire. If he is a gone case then let it be. He has got cancer. Leave it. But the one whom you feel sympathies with and one whom you feel will become all right, can be improved, you have the ways. These are primordial movements and you can put them right with those. Share with each other. Increase each others chakras. You should not feel bad at all. The one who feels bad he will be as wrong as the one who is troubling others. To feel bad and to trouble are the same; are the two parts of the same movement. So one should not feel bad at all. If someone says your chakra is catching you should be grateful to him that he could recognize it and you could not. If someone points out to you that a snake is biting, you are grateful to that person, so the one’s whose chakra has been caught up should feel grateful that person that he has pointed it out and you can clean it. Never feel bad.

You are so different from others because you have felt the vibrations. How many have felt it? You are greater than the big people. But as yet you are children. You are children in Sahaja Yoga. Pope doesn’t have any vibrations. All these so called Great people, these Shankaracharyas, and all, no one knows what kind of vibrations they have. You people can give realization and take them beyond. And you are twirling the Kundalinis of people. What a great thing you are doing. Besides Ganesha no one else could do this before. That is why the snake which is in Shri Ganesha’s hand is symbolic. With that he would twirl the Kundalinis of people. At least you have got one of the powers that you can raise the Kundalini of all. And still you are looking at the worldly. It is Divine, timeless. It has no location. It puts everything right. Just as much as it is delicate and loving that much it is destructive. It will move according to its way. You just move the way you have to.

First of all put your Heart Chakra right. Clean your heart. Is our heart clean or not? Do we have anger towards anyone? Do we have suspicion for another in our hearts? Check your heart. Heart is the greatest thing because the heart controls the brain, and it is from the heart that we do all work. Yours and My connection is with the heart only. So clean you heart chakra completely. On our part we think that a thing is like this Why the heart chakra? How much love have we given? How much did we trouble another? Mr Desai wrote to me that you have helped my wife so much. I was very Happy. Then Mr Desai wrote a very helpless letter about his wife. I said to so many people I have given so much and how has did she die? I sent her vibrations from London. You must help each other in every way. Love each other. We will all become one in this bandhan. We are one body of the Virata. And you people are sitting there on the Sahasrara of the Virata. I have made you sit on the Sahasrara of the Virata. And what madness are you doing! I have to make one thousand humans sit on the Sahasrara of the Virata Purusha. It looks like a big thing. By my saying this how many of you are feeling vibrations in your hand? You understand about the Kundalini, there is no doubt among any of you? What of Me? I have ploughed the land and will wait and watch.

I know everything. Whatever you do anywhere I know it. Nothing is hidden from me. Within you all there is a lot of mess. You should live in your Dharma, Peaceful and balanced. You have got a very big thing. Be satisfied. What is this making plans? What is this, like a stupid person. Other people may do this but you all? For little things...this is not done...that is not done. What is this? this is not done...that is not done....? In which direction are you going and thinking? You have to go to Delhi from here, and you think what is the price of flour there? But you have to go where no flour or anything works.

Dharma works there so know the value of Dharma. What is the need for Dharmic people to know the price of lentils and flour? Or what politics is cooking there? You know it. If you did not feel vibrations then it is a different thing. This flowing of vibrations is very little. As yet you are babies. I am not ready to even celebrate one year of your birth so at this stage a Ram Ram (taking god’s name) has been done forcefully. Look at yourselves. I am not going to tell you. ‘Has any change come into me or not? Has peace come within me or not? Has any change come or not?’

I have pulled you out from the very subtle nadi within the Sushumna. I have pulled you on a very line which is as fine as a strand of hair. The Sushumna itself is as wide as a strand of hair, and there are 4 layers on top of it. But it is through these vibrations that people are getting better. One lady came whose face looked different. She said her asthma got cured. What is so great that asthma got cured, cancer got cured! This is bound to happen. Whats so great about it? If you got electricity in your house then everything will become visible. If the electricity came in it brought light. What is so important about that? But by the light coming in what knowledge did you get? What new dimension did you see? What new thing did you do?

What I am saying, is it going through your head or your heart? If it goes through your head then there will be arguments. A dogma will be made of it. Let it go through the heart, there will be light. If you want to enjoy love then bring it to the heart. The Heart Chakra is what the Christians call the Sacred Heart. Within it is the place of Bhavani, Durga which is a very great place. It is not within you to understand Durga. That all the rakshasas are also Her children. The whole world is Hers. A mother’s Shakti destroyed them for the sake of Her love for Her children. To pull one’s own hands is very difficult. To give an injection to oneself with one’s own hands is very difficult. So, to kill one’s own children to protect other children is even more difficult.

But to kill is a very great act of the Shakti; a very great act of forgiveness. That is Her power of forgiveness but in Kali Yuga there is no need for you people to become Bhavani. Just become peaceful. Very peaceful...very peaceful.  Your peacefulness will take forward the work of Sahaja. You will see that people will say that in Sahaja Yoga we have seen such people who were so full of anger, who were statues of servility and completely suppressed, have become miraculously changed. You are your own advertisements. What other advertisement do you want? People should say what a man he is. He has such a large heart and is so wide in all aspects. It is happening. There is a lot of change from before. But it can be done with full force. It is now all upto you. Just as you understand, feel, listen to others, hear others peacefully. Feel others. You have got it en masse with others. Like this hand knows from the other hand; and from the same hand the brain also knows; the heart also knows and all these are moving together integrated.

In the same way, you will have to integrate. Then only will the thousand hands be ready, which in human form will be used. The same thousands hands which have come out from the Sahasrara of the Virata will come out from human beings. And these humans will be very ordinary. No great Rishis or Munis are needed for this to make them sit on the chakras. All these big people are sitting on the chakras. Only the ordinary will come out from the Sahasrara.

I am saying that start bathing each other every morning in your own homes with vibrations. First check your chakras between yourselves and then go out after bathing. Keep on cleaning. Everything becomes pure.

There is such turmoil in the world. You have no idea as to what is going on. A criminality is about to come. There is such a rule of the rakshasas which you are not aware of. And the rakshasas speak in such a way that they have a great fraternity. They stick to each other like glue. And among us, the way they work that they fall in an instant. Another falls there! That too in freedom. The rakshasas have a great unity. What fun they are having by killing one and throttling another.

When the group of saints will be made, then just think what can be! Saints have never had a group. This is the first time. But if the saints give up their sainthood then what is the use of such a group? All the qualities of a saint should shine through from you. Now tell all your worldly and gross problems before. Then we will do the puja at leisure. Take all this questions’ cow dung and throw it out. If someone has more faults then you can get together and put him right. But keep it without expectations. You are not you and the same with the other. So, have no expectations and be awakened to another in that state.

If someone has a lot of problems then put him right. But you should not feel bad. If someone feels bad then do it subtly. Treat him like who is sick. When you are coming to my feet then you can always tell by signaling. Each one will point out the same thing. So clear out the problem. We should all clear out each other together. There is no difference but it actually happens that one moves five steps ahead and then six steps behind. So the question is, "After how many years  will they reach? Or will they ever reach?" When you are in awareness then all will move in unison. Like the ocean is huge but its waves move together. The movement should move together.

Man: Please don’t feel bad, may I say that I am neither here or there. In a small group this happens that they think that he is big, or he is small, his chakras are new, he has this "badha" and this or that. I listen to both...

Shri Mataji: Now it is like this, you have one stick. Either you hit yourself or hit another. Better that you hit yourself. There is no big or small. There is no seniority in this. There is a reason for this that you have come from the worldly. Where you see that one is big, one is small, one is officer, one is below, one is this or that, one is king. Then one is sadhu, one is sanyasi. This is nothing but a churning. One is up then down, up and then down. I am just churning and nothing else. But we have to see who steals the butter. This churning is going on. Sometimes the cold will come sometimes the heat will come. The butter will come on top. The butter will float as it has become light. There is no high or low in this. Look at Modi, where he is. I purposely pushed the Kundalini there. Did you see that? No one is big or small. The one who thinks that I am big, or small, then remember then there is the Mahamaya sitting there. I will catch hold of the Kundalini in a such that I will see who is superior or inferior. The ones who think they are very great will be out.

I will deliberately make the Kundalini go down a few times. Because if I don’t make it go down then raise it and again I make it go down, and again raise it then it will not work out. I will deliberately make it go down.

[The man who is talking to Shri Mataji is an old man. So, Shri Mataji says:]

Old people will also have to be a little wiser. This is for all the old people. I too am included in this!! All the elderly people should know that in the worldly life you people are the leaders. You are the elders in the worldly way. So you all should be especially better. All of you become one. You should tell the children in this worldly way. Like Mr Modi, he is a very great man no doubt. But he also goes down. But one thing I have noticed that in every letter he makes a confession. His attention is on himself all the time. That is why I am fond of him as he confesses as to his faults, that Ma you are right. Such a person will be able to climb the first ladder. He wants to go higher he will climb again and again. But the one who thinks I am on a very high ladder..... We should look within and think within and see that we are climbing and falling, climbing and falling. It happens to everyone, because a churning is going on. In the churning [Samudra Manthan] there is no special position for anyone. The way of Sahaja Yoga is like a drama and is something that is new and never been tried before. No one has ever done it or such a churning has taken place.

One Gagangiri Maharaj sat for years in the forests doing tapasya. His churning did not take place. He made himself on his own power all alone. His matter is different. Yes he got the guidance as Ganesha’s guidance to you all. But who shakes his head many times? How to make him understand? You are Ganeshas. In fact, you are babies. They are stuck in My churning, poor things. One thing is true, that whether he is Shankaracharya or someone else, but no one knew so much about vibrations, the technicalities, the primordial, the movements. Read Shankaracharya or others, where is it written? It is not written anywhere.

[Shri Mataji greets a little girl who just came and related a story about her granddaughter, Aradhana.]

These highly realized souls have come on this earth, who are amazing! They are all getting ready within the age of 10 or 12 years. But till then you people don’t break my platform by wrestling among yourselves!!  If this is done then will my children do then?! They have come to play a big game. Now a little bit is alright but no dance of destruction! The organization will become harmonious when this movement becomes one. If one man is speaking more then just cool down. Cool down! Cool down! You feel cool so become cool also. Not hot, just cool. Coolness...Seriousness.... I am cool, on absolute zero. Earlier one went to the Himalayas. Now there is no need for the Himalayas. You can all start your air-conditioners here. Be alert towards yourselves. Look at your own faults. Look at your own chakras and help the chakras of others secretly. There is no need to tell. You can move your hands secretly. When realisation is happening while walking on the road then what! The more secretly you do the more pure it will be. The more love-filled it will be. It feels very good when something gets done secretly. It is happening with the land. They are saying it is being done, it will be done in whatever way. For that one person should get after the land. Ring up Swami Sahib and phone him and find out about the land. They will do it. (The Sahaja Yogis discuss with Shri Mataji whom they have to meet for the land.)

I want a program in April and I wanted to talk about the incarnation of the Adi Shakti. But at this stage perhaps it is too early as yet people do not understand what the Adi Shakti is. This Dilip Kumar the cinema person has also got his realization as he knows my brother very well. My brother told me that he can ask Dilip and get the cinema people to help as well. So please tell me. If you want then the poetry on the Adi Shakti, different types, then we can quote them but I don’t know how much people will have interest in this.... (one Sahaja Yogi suggests quoting Meerabai as she is very well known). If some lady comes who is made ready on this subject. Like Gopi Krishna (the dancer) who has many small children, or give it to some organization.. (the Sahaja Yogi says that for that one will have to prepare the song, then a list. It cant be done so fast)

So, I think, lets have a variety entertainment. Because the subject of Meerabai is of ‘separation’. We are talking of ‘union’ (with Divine). So, better than that is to have a variety entertainment. On the subject of the Adi Shakti, every religion will come in. So, for the variety entertainment there should be the subject of the Adi Shakti.

We should make 3 teams. One team to collect money, second team should see to it that the program is done properly and the third team should see to the expenses. There should be coordination. There should also see to the printing of a souvenir where the printing etc can be seen to. For the program arrangement get the musical minded Sahaja Yogis to see to it.

[Conversation goes on].

1975-0101 Dharm Va Adharm [Hindi] Mumbai (India) 40min

Part 1 – 30 mins

First line (Unclear). In Kalyuga, for human beings, there are no other means except forgiveness and more the power of forgiveness is with you, more you will be powerful. Forgive Everyone. Only those who are big can forgive, how can a small person forgive. Today morning I said, know the Dharma, know the Dharma which is inside you. We are standing on Dharma. A person who is standing on Dharma is so powerful. Know the Dharma. Aha ! how beautiful it is. We are standing in Dharma. We have no competition with those standing in Adharma. But we are standing in Dharma. Those standing in Dharma have a different way from those standing in Adharma. A Dharmic person cannot have a relation with an adharmic person. Even if we have a problem and hardships, but we are standing on our Dharma. That's the most important thing. Know your Shakti from inside which is Dharma and Dharma is nothing but love and when love is everything then forgiveness becomes one of its aspects. Who can oppress and how much in front of our love, let us see. Who can be evil, who can strike behind the back, who can give suffering, who can...(word unclear) ? Let them do it, in front of love everything...(word unclear). This is the only thing that fits into this kalyug. There is no other method in my understanding. If you think any of the older methods can be used, it cannot be done. There is one reason for that which I have told you earlier also and I am repeating now, there is no complete saint in kalyuga. Every saint ..(word not clear). They have entered into your attention. Have you understood? If there is someone who is completely saint, then its ok, paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम्‌), but there is an evil sitting with every saint person, then you have to separate that with extreme love. Now how difficult that task is? Whether you are standing on saintliness or evilness, is up to you, but if any evil is glued on you, you can remove that as well. But how many of such pure beings we have in this world today? There is a difference in degrees. And those who are going towards saintliness should collect (qualities of) saintliness. They should have no relationship with unsaintly. Those who are thieves, shrewd are unsaintly. What is their comparison with us ? That is theft. They cannot become us and we cannot become that. It cannot happen. They are on a different line and we are on a different line. To awake in Dharma is the only aim of Sahaja Yoga, there is no other aim of Sahaja Yoga. This is very simple, Sahaja Yoga doesn't have any relationship to all this. We have to rise in our Dharma, we have to achieve our enlightenment, we have to know ourselves. Some people ask, what to do Shri Mataji? Do we spin the chakras like this, like that? All these are primordial movements that I am telling you. But it will have a meaning only when it flows purely. If there is mixed (impurity) in you, and when you move hands then mixed (impurity) moves inside you. There cannot be purity inside us without forgiveness. And when purity comes inside us then the light of dharma spreads around, pure, Nirmal. Means, those who have dharma have to come in light, have to speak, have to share. But there should be dharma in his every gesture. He should think by himself that whether dharma or adharma is reflecting in his behaviour. If I would have given this lecture before realization, it would have been wrong because there is conditioning. That's why all psychologists have finished dharma and taught that each dharma has made us more conditioned by telling us do's and dont's. This is correct. But it is not going to happen now. Now whatever you want to do, you can do. There will be no conditioning at all. Because now your attention has been brought in between ego and superego. Dharma is rising by itself within you. You have yourself awakened it. It's way ..(words not clear). And whatever worldly knowledge you have known, you cannot compare it with divine knowledge. You cannot attach the value of worldly knowledge with divine knowledge. I am talking of divine and you are seeing it as worldly. The three dimensions of worldly knowledge are over. Those who have to move into the fourth dimension with depth and seriousness, I am talking of walking into the fourth dimension. You cannot benchmark worldly with the divine. Words not clear ...the suffering which I have seen and the people which I have seen, you won't find any abusive words for them, you won't find any description for them. Very evil people. But that state of society is very good these days. And your state is also good. But don't do trickery against yourself. Simple thing. Whatever you are doing with Sahaja Yoga, you are doing it with you...words not clear. Yes, words not clear....in administration, the question of what to do? Whether this is right or not? And This is so simple, before taking any decision, go to nirvicharita. Whatever decision comes from nirvicharita, juts do that. It cannot be wrong. Decision taken in nirvicharita will be spontaneous, and that taken by thought will be biased because your ego and superego are working in that. Whatever conditionings and worldly you have earned is behind you. But if you do in nirvicharita, it will be never like that. It will be divine, miraculous, miracle. Because in hindi, miracle means something very high and in Marathi, it means something odd. One will be miraculous of Hindi meaning and another will of Marathi meaning. So when we are talking of divine, your worldly formed pre-conceived ideas cannot guide God. He has His standing and His being. You want that God should be like us, so this same as those selling God (idol) for money. That level ...words not clear. God is what He is, He will enlighten your way. You keep opening your way.

Awaken Dharma within you. Know Dharma within you, it is very important to know this Dharma. How beautiful it is inside. There is so immortal thing flowing inside this mortal body, like confluence of three rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati, stream flowing. Hence you cannot know it through which is worldly and mortal. If you go into one second of Nirvicharita and take any decision, you will take such decisions which even these big people cannot take, dynamic, absolutely dynamic. Worries, Fear, Anger, Servility, Slavishness, Inferiority, all complexes will shed. He will speak in his pride. He has got his humility because it is so sweet so sweet, how it goes inside one doesn’t know. Words not clear. And when you are elected (by God), your importance is very high. Now you are thinking I am ordinary person, how am I chosen ? It will elected from ordinary persons only. And all these extraordinary person whom you see in world, in big big positions, will all become missing links tomorrow. It has always happened in the history of evolution. In every stage of evolution it has happened. Those who became mammoth, developed very big physically, became extinct, became missing links. Elephant was saved in them who was in the middle (path). Elephant ...words not clear. Likewise those who developed too much mentally, for ex. Fox became missing links and many like that but dog was saved. Similarly among human beings, who will rise from ordinary only. It has always risen from ordinary. And the so called extraordinary in three dimensions, are not going to do anything. They will become missing links in the evolution stage. People will know them as they know chimpanzee was a missing link. In evolution, from ordinary only will be chosen. One should be very normal. Those who are roaming like big sanyasis (saints/ascetics) are not going to reach anywhere, all are going to become missing links. And those who are in big positions also are not going to reach anywhere. So many have been given realisations, kings and words not clear. All are sitting in their thrones, does anyone feel like why this lamp is lit inside us ? They write letters to Me that they are in bliss, does anyone thinks to give it to others. If you have a special place, you have to be special. From ordinary only, extraordinary is going to come. That is going to refine. Slowly you will understand that these are big fools, who is going to talk to them. They are big doctors, what to do ? Big fools they are, they have not done anything in whole life. Lets leave it, what we have to do with it. Marathi words ..Our position is very high. And there cannot be education about this thing to human beings. It cannot be that I educate you and teach A,B,C,D to you. This you have to see in daily experiences. And the key thing which I told you today morning, you should know it that in Sahaja Yoga you are in Totality, not in Individuality. Now there is Gagangiri Maharaj, he is on a very high position as compared to you (Sahaja Yogis), he spent 21000 years, 21000 times he took birth and remained in jungles and he kept at Gods feet every time and then he got these vibrations. And why you (Sahaja Yogis) have got it instantly ? Because it’s a new world, it’s a new thing, you are part and parcel of body of Virata. He was made a symbolic man (apparently She is speaking about Gagangiri Maharaj). Its done. Forget about him. You all are in the form of totality. Those of you who want to be away from totality, should know, he will become cancer and will be finished. No one is bad among you and no one is good. If one finger pains, press it with another finger. If this hand pains, press it with another hand. You all are connected together, you all know that you all are connected together. When you share your badhas, why do not share your Dharmas. You call catch Badha instantaneously. Marathi words .. You all catch Badha instantaneously, then why not catch Dharma. What is the reason ? Simple reason is that we are now rising, we are small, growing up, we are small children now. First we will burn a little, fall a little. One day when (Sahaja Yogis) will grow up, (they) we will make thousands walk with (their) fingers. They are small now. No issue if you get robbed. Be in your innocence. But those who are robbing are thinking they are very smart, they should understand that they will be thrown out like cancerous cells. That’s also another path, where one if goes, never returns. There also a way to hell. Many people walk on that path, they don’t know, they come and think that it will be a big deed if I touch Mothers feet, if I wash Her feet. That path is also there, parallely running. When a flower blooms, the remains of a bud falls off and there is fragrance from the remains. Whatever has to fall, falls and whatever has to blossom, blossoms. Both happens at the same time. Life evolves like that. Those who have to fall, life will make them fall, will make them finish but they also have a storing time, a storing period. They also go and some go in manner that they do not return. From animals, they became humans. What is the use if from human life, you go to insect life ? There should be mutual competition in Dharma. Think that whether I am in Dharma or not ? And think about others that how much are they in Dharma. How much I am into Dharma and how much he (others) is into Dharma, and if he is in Adharma, why is he in Adharma. His which chakra is catching ? Only because of Chakra catching (he might be in Adharma), there is no other thing. See from detached point of view. Only chakra is catching, so it can be corrected by desiring. If it’s a gone case, then leave it, it will be a cancer. Leave it. Bury it. But if you think that he (other) can be corrected, if you have compassion, if you think his condition can be improved, then you have all the methods. These are primordial movements. You can correct them by those. Share between yourselves. Done feel bad. To feel bad is same as to give pain to others. To feel bad and to give pain to others is same thing. So do not feel bad. If some (sahaja yogi) says that your chakra is catching, then you should be grateful to him. If someone informs you that a snake is biting from here, you are greatful to him. In same manner you should be grateful to one who tells you about your chakra catching. Remove that (catch), cleanse that. However you are bigger than the rest of the world, because you have got the vibrations. How many people in the world have got it ? Even such a big Pope doesn’t have it, I have seen it. You are bigger than these big big people, but still you are children. You are children in Sahaja Yoga. Even Pope doesn’t have vibrations, these big big names, Shankaracharya etc. whom world bows down, don’t have vibrations. You all can give awakening and self realisation. You all are managing kundalini’s (of others) on your finger tips. How big a thing this is. Noone else except Ganesha could do this. The small snake in Ganeshas hand was symbolic of this because he used to manage everyones kundalini. At least now you are capable of raising others kundalini. (Speaking to Sahaja Yogi Mr Damle in Marathi). That is divine. There is no (word not clear). Word not clear. The more delicate and loving it is, equally devastating it is. It is going to move in its own way. You just move like this. Marathi words. First of all, cleanse you heart. Is my heart clean or not. Do I have anger against anyone in my heart. Do I have apprehensions about anyone in my heart. This is the biggest thing because heart controls the brain and we do all work by heart and you and Me and connected through the heart. That’s why first of all completely cleanse your heart chakra. We think from our angle that this is how it is. Towards heart chakra. How much love we have given to others. How much ...words not clear. I got letter from your Desai. He has written for him he helps my wife very much. I was so happy to read this. My joy knew no bounds listening this. Words unclear. I said I have given to so many people, how is it that she is suffering. Why I am bothered, I can send vibrations from London but why you have been given this (vibrations) for ? Words unclear. Love among yourselves. We will get tied in this one knot. There is one body of virata aud you are on Sahastrar of that body. I have put you on the Sahastrar of the virata and what these mad people are doing ? 1000 people have to be made sit on Sahastrar of the Virata. It look like a very big thing. It is. How many people have got vibrations on hand. You have received it. You understand kundalini, there is no doubt in that. What about me. I have ploughed the field, will see. Marathi sentence. Worldly people might complain, but why you (Sahaja Yogis) complain of small small things ? This thing didn’t happen, that thing didn’t happen. What does all this means. Which line are you in and what you are thinking. Now if you have to go to Delhi from here, you have to know the rate of flour there. But if you have to go where this flour etc. doesn’t exist, Dharma exists, then you should know the price of Dharma. For Dharmic people, What is the need to know the price of Flours & Pulses ? In place of what Dharma is running there, (we pay attention to) what politics is cooking there. You know all this. If you don’t get vibrations, then it’s a separate matter. This flowing (of vibrations) is a very small thing. It is almost nothing. You are just children. I am not even prepared to celebrate your 1st birthday. As of now, it is coerced (chanting of) Ram Ram. You should look at yourself, have I changed or not ? is there a difference in me or not ? Am I peaceful or not ? I have pulled you from the ultrasensitive nadi of sushumna (central channel). Drawn on one single thin line which I should say is equal to a hair strand. If you see Sushumna itself is that thick (hair strand). And it has four layers, one upon the other. But it is due to these vibrations only that people are getting cured. Today a lady came whose face was looking totally different. She was saying her asthama got cured. So what is the big deal in that ? If your asthama, cancer etc get cured, what is big deal in that ? It has to happen. There is no big deal in that. If electricity is brought in a home, then everything will be visible. Least of least this will happen. If light has come, then what is its purpose ? At least you should be able to see everything. There is no special thing in that. But after coming of this light, what is that you have known, what you have learnt, which new dimension you have seen ? This is the speciality. Whatever is being said, is it going above the head or from the heart. It should go from the heart. If it will go from the head, then arguments wlll be there, there will be dogma. If you allow it to pass through heart, light will be there. If you want to experience joy of love, then bring it on heart. Sacred Heart in Christianity is Heart Chakra only. And it is the place of Goddess Bhawani, Durga. And it is a very big place in the heart. It is not possible for you to understand Durga. All these rakshasas (evil people) are also her children. This whole world is her place. Sentence not clear. It is not easy to give onself an injection from own hands. It is not easy to kill your own children to save another (set of) children. But that killing is also a work of Shakti (power) and Kshama (Forgiveness).

It is very big work of forgiveness. In Kalyuga, you don't have to become Bhawani. Become peaceful, become extremely peaceful, extremely extremely peaceful. Your peace is only going to help our work. People will say we have seen Sahaja Yogis who were ambassadors of anger, servility, and fear who became so gracious. You people only are our advertisements. Who else is advertisement? People should say to you, you have such a huge persona, first class, you have so good temperament, you are wider in every sense. It is happening, happening a lot. Lot of difference from the past. But it can happen even faster.

Part 2 – 12 mins

Now everything is up to you. Up to how you think about it, understand it. Listen to others, understand others peacefully, feel others, identify with others, like one hand knows the other, this had is connected with brain also, heart also and all things are moving in an integrated manner. All of you have to integrate. Only then those 1000 hands will be prepared which will be used in human form. Those 1000 hands which are in Sahastrar of Virata, they will come out of human beings and from commoners. Big rishi munis are not required, those have been made to sit at chakras. Those who are big are sitting at chakras and doing their work. At Sahastrar only common people are going to come. Marathi sentence. First, clean the home. I am saying that you start cleansing each other with vibrations. You give to him and he gives to you. First, see the chakras among each other and then move out (to give others) after having cleansed and getting ready. You met Sharad, Sharad cleansed you, you cleansed Sharad, cleanse and move forward. It is done then, the situation is Nirmal. There is a lot of trouble going on in the outside world, you do not know what all is happening. Criminality is going to come, there is a kingdom of demons. Demons talk to each other and they form a group, they get stuck together like glue and those who work for us, they go here and get separated and they go there and get separated because they are in complete freedom. And see these demonic personalities, how they are collective, how they are enjoying, they kill, they murder. When there will be collectivity of saints, think what can happen. There hasn't been collectivity of saints till now. This is happening for the first time. If saint leaves his saintliness, what is the use of such collectivity? All qualities of saints should reflect from within us. (She speaks to someone) "Lal Saab, you all had a meeting, you do it and then do puja. Word meaning not clear ...I will not be able to speak then. Words meaning not clear. Now you tell, any problem, worldly, gross, everything, lets talk. And then do the pujan with comfort. All this dung, please collect it and cleanse it and throw it and then we will talk. Marathi (What are the problems). If someone has a problem, you all can help and correct him but keep neutrality (nirpekshita). You are not you, you are nirmal inside. You remain alert about others with neutrality, if you see any major problem with someone, then correct it. Don't feel bad. If someone feels bad, then communicate with signs. For ex. If you come to touch my feet, and someone feels bad, so it can be told in gestures. All will signal towards here. Let's remove it. We all can collectively cleanse each other.

Yogi: There is no difference between each other

Shri Mataji: There is none. But it happens so that we move 5 steps forward and then 6 steps backward. And again 5 forward and 6 backward and then the question arises in how many years they will reach. Like this, they won't reach at all, they are standing there only. This is the thing.

Yogi: Sound/Words not clear.

Shri Mataji: That also is correct. When you get to your awareness, it will move as one. For ex, in such a big sea, all its waves move as one. Your all movements should be one. Now it is that either you hit this one stick to yourself or to others. It is better to hit a stick to yourself only. There is no big and small in this. There is no seniority here. It has a reason, you all are coming from the mundane world where you have seen that there a big, a small, an officer, a king, a sadhu (saint), dand sanyasi (ascetic). There is nothing as such here. It is churning going on here. One up and one down, it's like that. I am doing churning only and nothing else. Now, who steals the butter remains to be seen. The intelligent one will steal the butter. This churning is already going on. Sometimes it will be hot, sometimes cool (vibrations) and butter will come on top. It will float in lightness. No one is high or low in this at all. One who thinks he is higher or lower, then there is Mahamaya also sitting, understand it. Their kundalini will be held in such a manner that they will see who is big. This is churning. Sometimes kundalini will also be brought down intentionally, also because reason is that unless it is brought down, then up and again brought down and up repeatedly, it is not going to happen. Intentionally she (kundalini) will be brought down. Those who are old should know that from a worldly point of view, they are the leaders. You all aged and old and hence you all have to be even better. You all get together and tell children from the mundane world view. Yes, spiritual anyone can. Those who are looking higher, even if they are standing at the first step, they will rise. Even if they step down, again and again, they will rise. But if anyone is thinking that only he is at a higher step, that is wrong. You should see and think from inside that you rise and you fall, you rise and you fall. It happens with everyone. Because churning is happening. In churning, there is no permanent place for anyone. The way of Sahaja Yoga is absolutely new and till now no one has done it and neither churning has taken place.

One man Gagangarh Maharaj, who sat in the jungle doing penance for years, you have no relation with him in this matter and he will not be able to make you understand anything because his churning has not happened. He has made himself on his own, alone. His matter is different. His guidance is just like Ganesha, who strikes his head many times as to how to make these people (Sahaja Yogis) understand. Now you are Ganesha (apparently Gagangiri Maharaj), these (apparently Sahaja Yogis) are not Ganesha, these are children. Agreed that you (G.Maharaj) are very big but these are children. And they are tied in my manthan (churning). I am the one in between and making understand. One thing is there, whether it was Shankaracharya or anyone else, no one knew about vibrations so much. So many technicalities, primordial movements, no one knew. You may read Shankaracharya or anyone else. Is it written anywhere? Nowhere it is written. Some 200-250 living beings have come on this earth. What beings are they, My God! They will be prepared in 10-12 years. Now till that time, you (Yogis) don't break my platform (laughter). If my platform breaks, what will my children do? They have come to play in this world. A little bit is okay but do not do Tandav Nritya. Organisation says that everything will fall in place if you all remain one. If anyone tries to be bigger, then others should remain cool, cool, cool. You get cool vibrations, no. Should remain cool also. Coolness. Deep. Dharma is cool. It exists on absolute zero, minus 275. On absolute zero it exists. That's why people used to go to Himalayas. Now you don't need the Himalayas, you open your air conditioner (vibrations) here itself. Look at yourself, be aware of your chakras and help in chakras of others, first secretly. No need to tell others when you can lay hand secretly. When awakening is happening on roads by just walking, so what is it? The more secretly its done, purer it will be and more lovingly it will be. Feels very good when you do something very secretly.
