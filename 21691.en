Welcome Talk

Shri Mataji: This is the first time I have come to Tunisia. I am so much enamoured by this kind of invitation and I am thankful to your government, thanking you all for inviting me and message from all of you for our benevolence. Tomorrow, of course, I will talk about it. I am so very thankful to you all to have come. And I hope tomorrow you will listen to me with an open mind. Thank you very much.
