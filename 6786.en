[First Warren introduced Sahaja Yoga]

"Doctor Warren has clearly told you about these subtle bodies within us. And we should think why this subtle boy was created? What was the need to create this body within and how it was created?
These, all these centers are the milestones of our evolution. And as we started growing, higher and higher, developing higher and higher awareness, we developed all these centers one by one. And at the human level it’s this center where the man raised his head up. Still why? What was the need to create a human being?
Supposing I’m trying to get some nuts, bowls and things, and try to fix them up, make it into a good instrument. One would ask what are you doing? Why are you assembling all this, what are you making out of it? After all, it cannot be a waste, why such a special thing has been made, for what purpose?
And that is what we have not yet discovered, what is our purpose.
But if you go to any of the Scriptures, you’ll find out that they have said, all of them has said, that you have to become your Self, that there is All Pervading Power around us. Now this All Pervading Power we cannot see. It exists. As they say, if you have to believe it, or not. But you should find out if there is such a Power or not. For example if I say that there are lots of beautiful pictures and beautiful music in his area, you won’t believe it. But if I get you a television set and if I plug it to the main, ou starts seeing that it is receiving something.
In the same way, when you become connected with the whole, then what should happen to you is that you start feeling that All Pervading Power. This is Self knowledge.
And it’s written at length, very clearly, by many people in the Indian Scriptures. The reason was, the people who came in the other parts of the world had such a tapasya [hard time] there were not given any chance to say anything much about it. Hardly they could utter anything and they were crucified, poisoned, beaten up, tortured, all kinds of problems they were given.
So this had to happen within us that you we should feel this All Pervading Power... "

"So we have the subject, the God Almighty is called as Sadashiva and His Power that is the Primordial Power, in Sanskrit is called as Adi Shakti, and we call it as Holy Ghost in the Bible.
So, they separate, I mean it’s a – some drive (?) has to be made now but doesn’t matter- I just tell you in short.
And this spectator, this Sadashiva, this God Almighty starts watching His own Power. Now we cannot understand the complete concord and complete understanding, complete oneness and integration between these two entities, God Almighty and His Power. It’s like the Sun and his rays or sunshine, Moon and moonlight. But even more than that. Nothing can come in between them. They are absolutely in unison with each other and every thing works simultaneously.
In human relationship, no husband and wife can be like that, it’s impossible.
Then the Spectator, Sadashiva, forces His Power, which forms an entity, to create. First, She refuses. And then He gives Her- I mean in a very poetic way- it’s called as a “Lasya”, means a launch and that gives the first sound, Omkara. That’s the first, logos, the first sound, the Verb. That’s the word She says, She creates.
Then She starts creating. She creates, She divides Herself first of all, She is nothing but the Power of desire. Because, first it is to be desired! It’s the God’s desire! She exists as a desire. Unless and until there is desire, nothing can work out. So She is the Power of desire. Like we have also the Power of desire within us. Then from this desire, comes the other Power which makes it an act. So the other Power of action comes in. These two Powers bring forth a system in between themselves like left and right, which starts giving sustenance to things that have been created. As I told you that carbon has four valences, it’s a tetravalent, I don’t know if you people have studied chemistry or not, there’s a chemical periodic table if you see, it’s all divided so beautifully and it is so well arranged, that one has to believe that there is a great juggler or a great planner who has done it, otherwise it’s not possible. It’s so well arranged! The all valences system and everything is so well arranged. All this is done by the central path which gives them the sustenance, the quality that they have.
Then the sustenance starts growing till you become a human being as shown here. In this void, here as carbon then you move into the void and here you go through all the evolution starting from a fish up to the human level where you become a small man. Once you become the small man, Vamana, is called that. First the man who came on this earth was a small statured man. Then a man came who was Parashurama, a very, very - Poseidon, a very large man, huge. Two extremes. And then, came the man who was in the center. And the leadership of all this evolution was done by the Incarnation of the aspect which is the evolutionary aspect. So the first aspect She creates is the desire aspect. When the desire dies, the all thing is destroyed. And the Spectator is watching. Spectator has a desire. As long as the Spectator is happy, the play goes on. As soon as He doesn’t like the spectacle, He disappears.
As soon as He disappears, then the whole show is over. It’s for that only Spectator the whole show is done.
So this Power of desire has to be till the end. Once the Power of desire is finished, then there is no more show; there’s no more Spectator, there’s no more His Power, they’re all much together and again become the Parabrahma [inaudible].

Now the other Power as I said which is the aspect of creation so the Creator aspect is there. One is the one which is the existence and the other side of the existence is the Destroyer. And then another aspect is of the Creator and the central one is the Sustainer, is the Protector. Out of these, this one incarnates, only one aspect because it has to give a quality and the leadership. For example, when there was a great flood, then He [Vishnu] incarnated. He incarnated as a fish and the dolphin-fish. Dolphin. I don’t know if you know about dolphin or not. But dolphin is a mammal and is a friend of human beings. So He incarnated as a dolphin-fish and saved the boat [Noa’s Arch]. As you know, there was a boat in which people were saved. He saved the boat. He is the dolphin who incarnated on this Earth.
One by one, He incarnates. Then He incarnates as a turtle, four legged which comes out of the water to show the fishes that you can come out. Then, gradually He incarnates as a quadruped. Like that, the Incarnations — He comes as a leader. Somebody has to give that confidence. One fish comes and takes them out and others come, they follow them up. As they go on improving, every time there is an Incarnation. And between one Incarnation and another Incarnation, there is a very great [long] time and that is called as Yuga. Like that the Incarnations come on this Earth.

Last incarnation of the Primordial Being comes in this area [Void] - where we can say this is the Ocean of Illusions - and try to save the people from getting too much to that side [right] or to this side [left] as I told you yesterday. And that time, when they become human beings, the seekers are born, the cores which are the epitome, epitome of human evolution.  

Now these seekers are engulfed by forces of ignorance and these ignorance forces also form anti-Christ. They can be devilish because they think: “why are we not there?” like a competition setting. And they try to retire the progress of the saints. That’s why a seeker, when he’s born, is attacked, from very childhood, immediately he is attacked.  Even the parents will attack the seeker. They may act through the parents. If not the parents, then the society, the schools. They’re all the time attacked. The people who are attacking may not be aware of it but they are used as mediums and these people are attacked.

And with that attack, when they are absolutely in a mess, and they don’t know how to save themselves, then, another Incarnation is specially made. It’s the One that manifest here, who is the desire Power of God, but is the Destroyer part, who is born to destroy these evil forces, to kill them. This is 14 thousands years back, the first incarnation of this great Lady. She’s called as Jagadamba, the Mother of this world.  She comes in here [center heart]. She saves us. Today is the first day, we celebrated the first day of an Incarnation and that is a very, very important day for Indians, because they believe in Shakti and She is the Shakti, that she came on this earth to kill the horrible devilish incarnations who are called as rakshasas. So this part is represented within us at the heart level in the center in the ?? culomn and it manifests in the children till the age of 12 in the sternum and creates antibody. She creates Her army as the antibodies. Till the age of 12 years the children develop those antibodies within themselves and whenever there is a danger, whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual danger, these antibodies fight. That’s why, when you are frightened, the sternum starts breathing fast and it sounds that all the antibodies should join hands to protect the subject. 
These antibodies are created here [center heart]. And the left hand side, left had side of this [left heart] is the essence of Motherhood. If in your childhood, your Mother had played a role which has given you fears or kind of frightening experience, then this center goes out, is said the left heart is catching. Sometimes, if you are a bad mother also it might catch.

The right heart is the one, is that of the father. And the fatherhood is expressed by the leader who came on this earth about 8 thousand years back, who is called as Shri Rama. If you see here, He’s in the center [Shri Mataji shows the right heart]. To make him a complete human being, He must push on to the right hand side. He is shri Rama. Shri Rama came on this earth to establish the institution of benevolent king. The political development and the political evolution started from this side [right side]. He is the one who gave leardership as a benevolent king, the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Shri Rama. But the modern Kings are not like that, they have no relation with God. On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people, absolutely Satan is there and you can see from the way they lead their lives, and they have led their life before. So the benevolence of Shri Rama is here [Shri Mataji shows the right heart] to be followed by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. He is the ideal that was created for human beings, to run their authority as the head, or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, who has to govern them by making them respectful, by respect. And if human beings create such things who are not respectable, those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage, those who are selfish, those who are self centred, then they have nothing to do to be there.
So this is the position of Rama who is the father. So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects, that’s what He has tried to show by his life. So much so that He had to sacrifice His beloved Wife, whom He loved so much. 

But these days, you know, how people do for their own children, they’ll sell the all country. In our India, they do it. Here it’s just the other way round, nobody cares for children at all and nobody knows whose children they are. But in India it’s the other way round, that they will even sell their country for their children. All these two extremes go against the character of  Shri Rama. Now this is the character that was created 8 thousand years back. 

So I’m explaining to you all these things. Now this is the heart. In the heart resides the Spirit. 
The Spirit is watching the game of this creation, and is watching what is happening to this person, this person, to this person, to this person. Every body has got in their heart the Spirit which is watching; it’s called as the “cetana” [consciousness], means the one, the knower of the field. He’s watching every minute; he knows what to do, where you go, what mistakes you create, he’s watching, he doesn’t interfere. He’s only- the interference comes from here [Swaddisthan?], from that thing, he tries to give you conscience, he tries to improve you from here sometimes [Mooladhara chakra], the wisdom part. He tries to tell you are not in the center by punishing you and showing it is wrong. But he’s just watching the game: “let’s see how far it goes.” He is the knower of your field. He is the Universal Being within you. He is the reflection of that God Almighty who’s the Spectator within you. And His Power is this All Pervading Power  which has created all this [subtle system]. So to feel this is this All Pervading Power, we have to become the Spirit. All this creation has no meaning if you don’t become the Spirit. In a way, that’s the first, the very first time I say that by reading Vedas, if you do not become Vedis -Vedinies- Veda word comes from vidya, vidya means to know; if you don’t become the knowledge, then it has no meaning. 

But knowledge doesn’t lie in dancing and shouting and all the monkey tricks that people do; it’s no monkey tricks there. Knowledge is that you become the Self, you feel the All Pervading Power and by which you know everything else. That is Self knowledge and that is what we have to achieve. 

If you do not want to become your Spirit, I’m sorry, I’ve nothing to offer. If you have some other things in your mind, you can go away from here, but no use arguing it, there should be no argument about it.  If you don’t want to become, I have nothing to say, I’ve nothing else to offer or to request you. I would request you that you become your Spirit, then we’ll talk about it. And when you become your Spirit – there’s a very good book written by Adi Shankara charya in the 6 century, the one who was the first Adi Shankara charya. Nowadays all of them are horrible ones. One of them is now making a big umbrella of gold, set [?] with diamonds, imagine! He’s a short fellow, I said this umbrella will fall upon him one day. He’s trying to compete with Pope. 
And this Adi Shankara charya has said that nothing can work it out, no Yoge, no shankye, [Sankhya, Yoga] all these philosophies are useless. It only works out- no discipline, nothing- by the Grace of the Mother; by the Grace of the Mother who is the Kundalini herself, She’s the Primordial Kundalini. Only by the awakening of the Kundalini it works out. It’s clearly given but you people do not read those books. 

Today is the day of the Goddess, ten of them are nothing but the different chakras, where She resides in the Mooladhara, She resides in the Swaddisthana, She resides in the Manipura, She resides in the -what you call- the Hridaya [heart] chakra, She resides in the Vishuddhi, then into Agnya, then into Sahasrara. All these names are given here. Of course, it was not as clearly said as it is said today because the time was not there to say. But all these things are there: how she rises, how she breaks all these "granthis" with are between these two charkas, and the "granthi" means the nodes. It’s so clearly given. It’s never given that you start jumping like a monkey, or you take out your clothe, all this nonsense is not there, on the contrary, it is said that this is all possession. You get "bhootagrasta", means you get possessed by the dead. It’s so clearly given! But people don’t feel these bhoots: they jump onto people who have come here to show some sort of a mesmerism and accept it. But you are seekers. 
I would request you, you are seekers, first of all know that you are seekers and don’t be deluded by these false things. Do not waste your energy on these false things, you’ll become your Self. Of course, it goes without saying that the change, the transformation, comes in, in your awareness first of all, in your awareness. Not in jumping and not with all those nonsensical things. I mean people think that if you become a stupid fellow, then your awareness has improved, is transformed, after all, after all your are transformed, you see, your are a sane person you’ve become stupid: you are transformed in any case. If you become mad, then is it a great transformation? Mother says: "Alright transformation, we have become mad. We were sane people, we are landing in a lunatic asylum, we are transformed. And also transmutation has taken place. Because now we wear dresses like lunatic people, we behave like lunatic people, transformation has taken place."
It’s an ascend of the mind, you have to ascend. Your awareness has to ascend and not to descend. It’s very easy to descend. To move on to the left or to the right is not the way, but to move here [Shi Mataji puts her hand above Her Sahasrara] into Super Consciousness. And that’s one thing one should know, should happen: that is the Self knowledge. That is the thing one has to get, is to awaken these centres within you which are represented on your fingers here, seven of these are shown here and then to feel the All Pervading Power to begin with. Once it has happened, then to know how to design, how to decode, how to find out, how to improve, how to go further. First of all, get the connection. If your car has not yet started, what are you doing about it? It’s so simple and such a common sense, but I don’t know how these people are taken over. 
The only problem, as I told you before, is this, that God has given you freedom and that freedom is to be respected. 
But if you go to this people you don’t ask any questions, you do as others do just like monkeys, you don’t even think why they are doing it. I mean you see that it is so filthy. 
Like a gentleman who came to me, who went to a guru, and he was absolutely ruined. I said:  "How could you do? You are an Indian, don’t you know that this is not to be done?" He said: "I just tried to see. Just out of curiosity I went there. And I also started jumping and I got into it. " And for five years he was in it, he could not know that he was in it. I said for Indians they have some wisdom because they have read all these things, they know all about it. "How could you do it?" They know that unholiness is not the way to God. Now, some of them can give you also an explanation that all your- you are to be cleansed. And you pay for it as if you go to some a laundry here, you pay for it, you put yourself into it, it goes into some turnings and you become clean. You are to be cleansed. You must see their life pattern, you see, you must see how they live. 
The person who cannot even smell a flower how can he cleanse you?"
