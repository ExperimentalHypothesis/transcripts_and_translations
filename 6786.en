"Then the sustenance starts growing till you become a human being as shown here. In this void, here as carbon then you move into the void and here you go through all the evolution starting from a fish up to the human level where you become a small man. Once you become the small man, Vamana is called that ... First the man who came on the Earth was a small statured man. Then a man came who was Parashurama, a very very ...

"One is the one which is the Existence and the other side of the Existence is the Destroyer. And then another aspect is the Creator and the central one is the Sustenance, is the Protector. Out of these, this one incarnates. Only one aspect because it has to give a quality and the leadership. For example, when there was a great flood, then He Incarnated. He incarnated as a fish and the dolphin-fish. Dolphin. I don't know if you know about dolphin or not. But dolphin is a mammal and is a friend of human beings. So He incarnated as a dolphin-fish and saved the boat. As you know, there was a boat in which people were saved. He saved the boat. Is the dolphin who incarnated on this Earth. One by one, He incarnates. Then He incarnates as a turtle, four legged which comes out of the water to show the fishes that you can come out. Then, gradually He incarnates as a quadruped. Like that, the Incarnations -- He comes as a leader. Somebody has to give that confidence. One fish comes and takes them out and others come, they follow them up. As they go on improving every time there is an Incarnation. And between one Incarnation and another Incarnation, there is a very great time and that is called as Yugas. Like that the Incarnations come on this Earth."
