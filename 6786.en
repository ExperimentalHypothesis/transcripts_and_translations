[First Warren introduced Sahaja Yoga]

"Doctor Warren has clearly told you about these subtle bodies within us. And we should think why this subtle boy was created? What was the need to create this body within and how it was created?
These, all these centers are the milestones of our evolution. And as we started growing, higher and higher, developing higher and higher awareness, we developed all these centers one by one. And at the human level it’s this center where the man raised his head up. Still why? What was the need to create a human being?
Supposing I’m trying to get some nuts, bowls and things, and try to fix them up, make it into a good instrument. One would ask what are you doing? Why are you assembling all this, what are you making out of it? After all, it cannot be a waste, why such a special thing has been made, for what purpose?
And that is what we have not yet discovered, what is our purpose.
But if you go to any of the Scriptures, you’ll find out that they have said, all of them has said, that you have to become your Self, that there is All Pervading Power around us. Now this All Pervading Power we cannot see. It exists. As they say, if you have to believe it, or not. But you should fid out if there is such a Power or not. For example if I say that there are lots of beautiful pictures and beautiful music in his area, you won’t believe it. But if I get you a television set and if I plug it to the main, ou starts seeing that it is receiving something.
In the same way, when you become connected with the whole, then what should happen to you is that you start feeling that All Pervading Power. This is Self knowledge.
And it’s written at length, very clearly, by many people in the Indian Scriptures. The reason was, the people who came in the other parts of the world had such a tapasya [hard time] there were not given any chance to say anything much about it. Hardly they could utter anything and they were crucified, poisoned, beaten up, tortured, all kinds of problems they were given.
So this had to happen within us that you we should feel this All Pervading Power... "

"So we have the subject, the God Almighty is called as Sadashiva and His Power that is the Primordial Power, in Sanskrit is called as Adi Shakti, and we call it as Holy Ghost in the Bible.
So, they separate, I mean it’s a – some drive (?) has to be made now but doesn’t matter- I just tell you in short.
And this spectator, this Sadashiva, this God Almighty starts watching His own Power. Now we cannot understand the complete concord and complete understanding, complete oneness and integration between these two entities, God Almighty and His Power. It’s like the Sun and his rays or sunshine, Moon and moonlight. But even more than that. Nothing can come in between them. They are absolutely in unison with each other and every thing works simultaneously.
In human relationship, no husband and wife can be like that, it’s impossible.
Then the Spectator, Sadashiva, forces His Power, which forms an entity, to create. First, She refuses. And then He gives Her- I mean in a very poetic way- it’s called as a “Lasya”, means a launch and that gives the first sound, Omkara. That’s the first, logos, the first sound, the Verb. That’s the word She says, She creates.
Then She starts creating. She creates, She divides Herself first of all, She is nothing but the Power of desire. Because, first it is to be desired! It’s the God’s desire! She exists as a desire. Unless and until there is desire, nothing can work out. So She is the Power of desire. Like we have also the Power of desire within us. Then from this desire, comes the other Power which makes it an act. So the other Power of action comes in. These two Powers bring forth a system in between themselves like left and right, which starts giving sustenance to things that have been created. As I told you that carbon has four valences, it’s a tetravalent, I don’t know if you people have studied chemistry or not, there’s a chemical periodic table if you see, it’s all divided so beautifully and it is so well arranged, that one has to believe that there is a great juggler or a great planner who has done it, otherwise it’s not possible. It’s so well arranged! The all valences system and everything is so well arranged. All this is done by the central path which gives them the sustenance, the quality that they have.
Then the sustenance starts growing till you become a human being as shown here. In this void, here as carbon then you move into the void and here you go through all the evolution starting from a fish up to the human level where you become a small man. Once you become the small man, Vamana, is called that. First the man who came on this earth was a small statured man. Then a man came who was Parashurama, a very, very - Poseidon, a very large man, huge. Two extremes. And then, came the man who was in the center. And the leadership of all this evolution was done by the Incarnation of the aspect which is the evolutionary aspect. So the first aspect She creates is the desire aspect. When the desire dies, the all thing is destroyed. And the Spectator is watching. Spectator has a desire. As long as the Spectator is happy, the play goes on. As soon as He doesn’t like the spectacle, He disappears.
As soon as He disappears, then the whole show is over. It’s for that only Spectator the whole show is done.
So this Power of desire has to be till the end. Once the Power of desire is finished, then there is no more show; there’s no more Spectator, there’s no more His Power, they’re all much together and again become the Parabrahma [inaudible].

Now the other Power as I said which is the aspect of creation so the Creator aspect is there. One is the one which is the existence and the other side of the existence is the Destroyer. And then another aspect is of the Creator and the central one is the Sustainer, is the Protector. Out of these, this one incarnates, only one aspect because it has to give a quality and the leadership. For example, when there was a great flood, then He [Vishnu] incarnated. He incarnated as a fish and the dolphin-fish. Dolphin. I don’t know if you know about dolphin or not. But dolphin is a mammal and is a friend of human beings. So He incarnated as a dolphin-fish and saved the boat [Noa’s Arch]. As you know, there was a boat in which people were saved. He saved the boat. He is the dolphin who incarnated on this Earth.
One by one, He incarnates. Then He incarnates as a turtle, four legged which comes out of the water to show the fishes that you can come out. Then, gradually He incarnates as a quadruped. Like that, the Incarnations — He comes as a leader. Somebody has to give that confidence. One fish comes and takes them out and others come, they follow them up. As they go on improving, every time there is an Incarnation. And between one Incarnation and another Incarnation, there is a very great [long] time and that is called as Yuga. Like that the Incarnations come on this Earth.

Last incarnation of the Primordial Being comes in this area [Void] - where we can say this is the Ocean of Illusions - and try to save the people from getting too much to that side [right] or to this side [left] as I told you yesterday. And that time, when they become human beings, the seekers are born, the cores which are the epitome, epitome of human evolution.  

Now these seekers are engulfed by forces of ignorance and these ignorance forces also form anti-Christ. They can be devilish because they think: “why are we not there?” like a competition setting. And they try to retire the progress of the saints. That’s why a seeker, when he’s born, is attacked, from very childhood, immediately he is attacked.  Even the parents will attack the seeker. They may act through the parents. If not the parents, then the society, the schools. They’re all the time attacked. The people who are attacking may not be aware of it but they are used as mediums and these people are attacked.

And with that attack, when they are absolutely in a mess, and they don’t know how to save themselves, then, another Incarnation is specially made. It’s the One that manifest here, who is the desire Power of God, but is the Destroyer part, who is born to destroy these evil forces, to kill them. This is 14 thousands years back, the first incarnation of this great Lady. She’s called as Jagadamba, the Mother of this world.  She comes in here [center heart]. She saves us. Today is the first day, we celebrated the first day of an Incarnation and that is a very, very important day for Indians, because they believe in Shakti and She is the Shakti, that she came on this earth to kill the horrible devilish incarnations who are called as rakshasas. So this part is represented within us at the heart level in the center in the ?? culomn and it manifests in the children till the age of 12 in the sternum and creates antibody. She creates Her army as the antibodies. Till the age of 12 years the children develop those antibodies within themselves and whenever there is a danger, whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual danger, these antibodies fight. That’s why, when you are frightened, the sternum starts breathing fast and it sounds that all the antibodies should join hands to protect the subject. 
These antibodies are created here [center heart]. And the left hand side, left had side of this [left heart] is the essence of Motherhood. If in your childhood, your Mother had played a role which has given you fears or kind of frightening experience, then this center goes out, is said the left heart is catching. Sometimes, if you are a bad mother also it might catch.
