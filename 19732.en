Interview with BBC Radio Broadcast

Reporter: Vibratory awareness. Now I need to place you in collective consciousness, the second birth. The places we call the hippy trend in the 60's with yellow roads and the solemn gurus. [And today, After those days] it's [all] going very strong, and today a new book is published to claim yet another new dawn to [call as] very good things to [present] out. The book is called tie Advent and it deals with the vibratory awareness available through something called Sahaja Yoga and has been UNCLEAR written by Gregoire de Kalbermatten of the Swiss diplomatic corp. Built in its London [precincts] [UNCLEAR at/to] India House of the Indian High Commissioner and to the founder of Sahaja Yoga, Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi. And it's very true and he set out to meet the lady [UNCLEAR who is/he's] not yet vibratory [UNCLEAR- ].
Another Reporter: The [UNCLEAR movement/London] starts with Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi [UNCLEAR ... documents have been personally decorated with tapestries and traditional Indian wood carvings ...].
The lady was introduced: Shri Mataji which means Mother. [UNCLEAR So the/A] plump middle-aged woman dressed in a sari [UNCLEAR] [ UNCLEAR speech/and here over tea and Indian sweets] we discussed how to achieve vibratory awareness. And here comes the difficult part: in a debate lasting several hours She parried all my objections [UNCLEAR with/through] Her talk of thoughtless awareness and [evolutionary moot] with simple solutions. Then how is it done? The answer it seems, is Sahaja Yoga, the releasing of the potential in every human being but [for their] spiritual integration. I sat on an armchair, palms upwards, and Mataji made these curious passes over my hand — in fact various parts of my head — in an effort to encourage my natural [UNCLEAR life/vital] force [to expand it from within me]. She [ UNCLEAR claimed/told me] she could see it; I certainly couldn't. She told me I had sinus trouble, which is true, and liver problems which [such] as far as I know is not. I did feel relaxed, peaceful, exalted. Shri Mataji explained the benefits of vibratory awareness.
Shri Mataji.: You'll get complete integration of your mental, physical and emotional being. Secondly, your mental, emotional, physical being is completely benefited because you get connected with the main source. For example, if you are going by a car and if your petrol is finished, then you built up a tension. But if you are connected to a source, from where the energy is all the time coming, all your mental, physical, emotional energy is coming from one source, and if that is opened out, in the medical terminology if you can master your parasympathetic nervous system, then there is no problem coming. And all the time you are [getting] dynamic and you start working the twenty-four hours. Also, you don't feel tired and you are absolutely relaxed. The tensions are lost and your diseases, [especially your, physical] diseases disappear, [UN-CLEAT your/emotional] problems disappear and you become a very [UNCLEAR normal/healthy] person.
Interviewer: This sounds absolutely marvelous, [it sounds so easy] and why isn't everyone doing it? Shri Mataji: It's the easiest thing [that anyone can do, people don't want to do]. You see, if I tell
people to stand on their heads they will be very happy. They'll pay money for that if I tell them to stand
on their heads. You see, people don't want to do easy things because that challenges their ego. Interviewer: Do you charge for your knowledge?
Shri Mataji: Not at all. What can you pay for love? You can't pay [single pie] for God's love. It's so perfect.
Interviewer: [UNCLEAR.] quite hard to swallow, and so I was surprised to learn that the is endorsed by the Indian High Commission [UNCLEAR ] Indian Government. Mataji is not the first Indian guru who claims to give increased awareness. [Religious or psychological jargon Indian] [Yoga itself] is quite acceptable [UNCLEAR nowadays/these days]. But how is Shri Mataji's new method [is] different [ UNCLEAR all the from/from all the/all the from, from all the] others [as that is supposed to be an escape to the nonsense]?

Shri Mataji: Some of them are robbers, some of them are fakes, some are affected [ UNCLEAR]. I agree that they entirely that exists but if there is a method which is fake [UNCLE-iR], must be of these people, there must be something genuine also because if you find so many fake people, then everything fake must have some genuine basis and there must be something genuine. The only trouble is how to go about it? How do you find [UNCLEAR out/that] the reality? You need a proper understanding what you have to find out, what is an experience, all that you must know, you must be very strict about it, and then only you can find out. But if you are nice they can make money out of you. Why not? That's how they are. They're all just like that.
Interviewer: So why then should I or anyone else listen to [ UNCLEAR this belief/those believes/this belief, those believes] that You have something to offer?
Shri Mataji: You see, because I don't want you to believe, as I have told you. You don't have to believe into anything. You have to experience it. The power is to experience. You don't have to believe into it at all. There is no need to believe but you should [ JNCLEAP]. Keep your eyes open just like [JNCLEAr ]. But to say that this is a new idea, it's not true because this has been there. You are your own guru. Everybody has said that you are guru, is within you. Only thing, is just to be awakened. I'm not a guru. I'm just a Mother.
Interviewer: [And that is] Mrs. Mataji Nirmala Devi. [...]
