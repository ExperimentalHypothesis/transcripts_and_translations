Interview with BBC Radio Broadcast, London, 17 March 1980

Lady interviewer: Vibratory awareness. Now I need to place you in collective consciousness, the second birth. The places we call the hippy trend in the 60’s with yellow roads and the solemn gurus. After those days going strong and today a new book is published to claim yet another new dawn to call as phrases from its present out [unsure].The book is called The Advent and it deals with the vibratory awareness available through something called Sahaja Yoga. It has been in congress [unsure] and written by Gregoire de Kalbermatten of the Swiss diplomatic corp. Based in London and press-launched in India House to the Indian High Commissioner and to the founder of Sahaja Yoga, Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi. And it’s very true and he set out to meet the lady who was not yet vibrating the sample [unsure].

Second interviewer: The London flat where lives Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi [inaudible] has been redecorated with tapestries and traditional Indian wood carvings. I removed my shoes and have been sitting. In the living room was introduced to Shri Mataji, which means Mother. She’s a plump middle-aged woman dressed in a sari, intelligent from birth in mid-life. Here over the tea and Indian sweets, we discussed how to achieve vibratory awareness.

And here comes the difficult part: in a debate lasting several hours, She parried all my objections to her thoughtless awareness and evolution releasing with simple question: how is it done? The answer, it seems, is Sahaja Yoga, the releasing of the potential in every human being to conceive their spiritual integration.I sat on an armchair, palms upwards, and Mataji made these curious passes over my hand — in fact various parts of my head — in an effort to encourage my natural vital force to spring from within me. She claimed that she could see it; I certainly couldn’t.She told me I had sinus trouble, which is true, and liver problems which, as far as I know is not. I did feel relaxed, peaceful, and positive. Shri Mataji explained the benefits of vibratory awareness.

[The interviewer presents an extract from Shri Mataji’s interview.]"You’ll get complete integration of your mental, physical and emotional being. Secondly, your mental, emotional, physical being is completely benefited because you get connected with the main source. For example, if you are going by a car and if your petrol is finished, then you built up a tension. But if you are connected to a source from where the energy is all the time coming, all your mental, physical, emotional energy is coming from one source, and if that is opened out, in the medical terminology if you can master your parasympathetic nervous system, then there is no problem coming.And all the time you are little dynamic or lethargic. Must be- potential from [inaudible], you don’t feel tired and you are absolutely relaxed. The tensions are lost and your diseases, physical diseases disappear, emotional problems disappear and you become a very normal person.

Interviewer: This sounds absolutely marvellous! I mean, if it’s truly prone to be easy, why isn’t everyone doing it?Shri Mataji: It’s the easiest thing, people don’t want to do. You see, if I tell people to stand on their heads they will be very happy. They’ll pay money for that if I tell them to stand on their heads, you see. People don’t want to do easy things because that challenges their ego.Interviewer: Do you charge for your knowledge?Shri Mataji: Not at all! How can you pay for love? How can you pay a single pie for God’s love? It’s not proper. "

[The interviewer resumes his monologue.]But all of this is quite hard to swallow. And so I was surprised to learn that the movement and the several [inaudible] in Indian and British [inaudible] is endorsed by the Indian High Commission and claimed to assist the Indian Government. But Mataji is not the first Indian guru who claims to give increased awareness, accompanied by impenetrable religious or psychological jargon.

Yoga itself is quite acceptable these days. But how is Shri Mataji’s new method different from all the others? When it get proven to be an expensive nonsense?

[Extract of Shri Mataji]:"Some of them are robbers, some of them are fakes, some are enterprisers. I agree entirely that it’s false. But if there is such a thing, an export working of good people, there must be something genuine also because if you find so many fake people, then everything fake must have some genuine basis and there must be something genuine. The only trouble is how to go about it? How do you find out the reality? In your proper understanding, what you have to find out, what is an experience, all that you must know, you must be very strict about it, and then only you can find out. But if you are naïve, they can make money out of you. Why not? That’s how they are. The world is like that.

Interviewer: So, why then should I or anyone else listen to that [?] that You have something to offer?Shri Mataji: You see, because I don’t want you to believe, as I have told you. You don’t have to believe into anything. You have to experience it. The point is of experience. You don’t have to believe into it at all. There is no need to believe but you should also deny everything. Keep your eyes open just like you would to any knowledge. But to say that this is a new idea, it’s not true because this has been there. You are your own guru. Everybody has said that your guru, is within you. Only thing, it has just to be awakened. I’m not a guru. I’m just a Mother.

Interviewer: Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi.

"... Exhaustion causes the diseases and sicknesses, even mental sicknesses at different levels. Now this exhaustion takes place because we go to extremes, you see. That extreme use of things that’s why it gets sick faster. And these exhaustions are fulfilled or nourished or, we can say, vitalized by these, so the person feels all right. It’s very simple.

Lady interviewer: So, that’s what Western medicine or what medicine in general calls organic diseases. It’s nothing more than an imbalance of the forces of love and the Spirit.Shri Mataji: Of course, of course, no doubt. But I would put it like this, that the modern medical science as they are, they talk of the autonomous nervous system. Autonomous, what’s for?Lady interviewer: Autonomous nervous system.Shri Mataji: In that, we have got the left side autonomous nervous system and right side the autonomous nervous system as sympathetic nervous system. And in the center, we have parasympathetic nervous system.

Now, the sympathetic nervous system acts for all emergencies, for all our extreme behaviour. Under these two, form the centre in- and in the centre lies the parasympathetic nervous system.

Now the parasympathetic nervous system has got limited energy which it supplies to the sympathetic to keep a balance. But if you go beyond limits when you exhaust it completely, then parasympathetic also fails and there is no balance brought in.Now if you ask any doctor and if he is honest, he will tell you that they don’t know anything about parasympathetic nervous system. Now, who is this "auto"? We should find out. This "auto" is the Spirit. And when this Kundalini rises, she enlightens and nourishes this parasympathetic nervous system which again, by itself balances.

I don’t have to tell you that, "You don’t drink, you don’t do", I never say that. You yourself will not do it because religion gets enlightened within you, the living religion and you just don’t do it. I mean, you just don’t do it because your attention is not there anymore, finished.

Lady interviewer: I’ve heard you saying, "Never try to give up a bad habit but if you think first on the Lord and trust on God then those things give you up" like a-Shri Mataji: They run away, they run away. You see, there was a gentleman, a doctor. He came to Sahaja Yoga and he lost all his habits. He became master of its own.But once he came to Germany, after two months, and he said, "Let me try" the wine he likes. "So, let me try the wine, doesn’t matter". And he regretted, he felt this horrible [inaudible], got all the smell of the molasses in it, he threw it and started vomiting. He said, "What is this nonsense I have been drinking?"Let that it happens to you, I mean we have had alcoholics, people who have been taking drugs for years! People came in coma to Me. You won’t believe, they all have given up. I never tell them. I am a mother, I’m not here to dominate or to curb your personality. I’m here to nourish you, to make you grow into your own being to be your own master, to be your own guru.

Lady interviewer: Then suppose that somebody listening says, "My greatest desire, my greatest slack rather, is companionship. I’m living in this town, I’m alone, I don’t have any friends, I go to the office every day and I just come home at night to a lonely place. What can I do to find companionship and love?"Shri Mataji: You’ll get companions and companions and you’ll have no time to feel alone. That’s what is one thing definitely promised in Sahaja Yoga. Because what happens, you become collectively conscious. And once you become collectively conscious, there are so many who become collectively conscious with you because it’s a mass thing that is happening today. It used to be individual before now it’s mass, that’s what I have done. That’s my- I should say, if you say it’s my discovery, how to become a mass evolution.Lady interviewer: How to do the mass?Shri Mataji: Mass, a-mass, this happens a-mass.Lady interviewer: A-mass?Shri Mataji: A-mass.Lady interviewer: Collectively?Shri Mataji: Collectively. So, thousands of them can get Realization at the same time.You’ll be amazed, I have taught one gentleman from India who has come. He has given Realization to ten thousand people himself in India.Lady interviewer: How do you give Realization?Shri Mataji: I mean there are no words to say, it manifests I mean to say. There is no giving as such.Lady interviewer: So, you open yourself to the being, [?] brilliant?Shri Mataji: No, you see, it is simple, as I would say an analogy, like a lamp is ready; say, a candle is ready. Now another candle which is enlightened can enlighten another candle, isn’t it? What do you do? Nothing.

Lady interviewer: So, you just, you just are.Shri Mataji: Manifest, yes, you are. And you become that.Lady interviewer: And-Shri Mataji: then you become the same, you can give it to others.Lady interviewer: So, you are recognised, each person that is ready for that enlightenment recognises there.Shri Mataji: I don’t rationalize.Lady interviewer: Yes, [inaudible].Shri Mataji: I don’t judge anyone. I just stand there and people put their hands toward Me. And finished! Some people are declared to be the worse sinners, this, that, they got it. I don’t know how people judge others; you see? It’s better to leave it to God to judge; I don’t judge anyone. And it works out. Thousands can get it so what is there? There’s no time for judging anymore left now. Those who want should have it.

Lady interviewer: What about somebody that listens and says, "But I believe three quarters of my life and I realize now that I’ve done the wrong thing. I took the wrong path and nothing is working out right. And I look back at my life and I see series of crashing, failures and broken relationships and all those things. How can?"Shri Mataji: You see, for such people, I would say that they must think of the present, not of the past nor of the future. Because past doesn’t exist, it’s finished. And the future also doesn’t exist. Think of the present. Now, I ma before you want to have your Realization, do have it. Why to think of the past? So, fix it, it’s not important. And more you’ll think of these things you will develop against which will give Me trouble because I’ll have to clear out one side of your centre, you see? So, not to feel guilty. Whatever has happened, has happened. Everything is forgiven, forget it! You’d better forgive yourself.

Lady interviewer: So, forgiveness is very much a part of the-Shri Mataji: Of course, that is the greatest weapon we have got. That’s one of the mantras we have to use that you forgive yourself and you forgive others.

Lady interviewer: Then, basically, the enlightenment runs through all the thought system as you said in the beginning of our conversation. That much of what you say is Christian in the getting rid of the guilt and in the forgiveness and you’ve run through other religions as well.Shri Mataji: Everywhere, they are just the same, you see, I have to just see how they are related to each other. Christ himself has said that, "Those who are not against Me are with Me". Who are those? Nobody has tried to find out.It is said that, "I’ll appear before you like tongues of flames". What is that? These are the centres. It’s clearly said. Even Muhammad Sahib has said that, "You have a power in your bone, triangular bone called as Assas". Even the Greeks believed in that. Not only that but even Muhammad Sahib has gone to this extend to say that, "When the Resurrection time will come, your hands will speak". But no one wants to talk of Resurrection, everybody wants to talk of the Doomsday. Nobody wants to talk of the Comforter, they want to talk about the white horse. But when the white horse will come, no argument, no explanation, no interviews, that will be the last sorting out. So, please, this is a very important time. Everyone must now that we haven’t achieved anything so far, whatever we have been doing. So, give us a chance. We have to be fair to ourselves and to our Creator. Because he has taken so much care to make you a human being. He has put in all his efforts. He’s anxious that you enter into his kingdom. You must give him a chance and don’t stick onto things, don’t get misidentified. What have you got? Just measure that. Now what you have to get is so simple.
