Greetings to all the seekers of truth in Jaipur. Every individual lives according to their beliefs. Whatever beliefs one adopts, they shape their life. However, there comes a point in such a life where one realizes, "What I have thought so far, the beliefs I have held, have not borne fruit. I have not attained joy from them, I have not found resolution, and I have not attained peace." When that point confronts a person, they become doubtful of their beliefs. And at that moment, they begin to search for what lies beyond, what lies beyond this, what world is beyond this, which I must attain. When this journey begins, only then can we say that a person becomes a seeker. In the pursuit of truth, one wanders far and wide. Sometimes one thinks, "If only I gather wealth, then through that wealth I will attain joy." Then one thinks, "Let me attain power – through attaining power, I will attain joy." Then someone thinks, "If I just love a particular person, then I will attain happiness through that alone." Moving beyond this, when one rises to expansiveness, they think, "If I serve all beings, do some good for them, perform actions for their upliftment, then I will attain the Divine." But these are all human beliefs. Through human belief, one cannot reach towards the Divine, because the Divine is infinite, and with limited intellect, we cannot dive into the infinite.  If we think of the progress we have made so far, everything has been natural. Even the fact that we have become human today has happened naturally. We haven't done anything for it. Whatever about Kundalini and so on has been explained to you, all these things, you didn't create them, they were already within you. You have discovered them in your evolution. And in this evolution, all this asset that you have found, you just have to attain it, understand it, and accept its ownership. Now, whether what we are saying is true or false, whether it is within you or not, if we look at it from a scientific perspective, we would say that just like someone presents a hypothesis which you can call a hypothesis, then another scientist calls that hypothesis, 'Alright, demonstrate it.' If it is proven, then it is considered a rule. People accept it as a scientific fact because it becomes a recognized principle of science. Similarly, in religion, when we accept something, we must understand whether what is described in this religion, we are experiencing it or not. But in matters of religion, our vision is very blind. We do not think that whatever is described in it, we have achieved it. Especially this morning, the conversation was going on, so I said that most Hindus are very unfamiliar with their religion. The reason could be that these people have never been organized – there is some benefit to that. If a religion organizes you more than necessary, then a person becomes like he has tied something in front of his eyes like a bull or a horse. But another flaw is that he also knows nothing. That's why we, who inherited the spiritual knowledge accumulated here for so many years, are completely unfamiliar with it, we know nothing about it. It is very surprising that when I mention Kundalini to many people, they think I am talking about Kundli, which is called horoscope. It's very surprising that we don't even know our fundamental elements. In this country, the wealth of knowledge earned for so many years, for thousands of years, we know nothing about it. Our vision is not towards that, our vision is outward; we don't even want to know about it. The knowledge that is our heritage, accumulated for thousands of years, we are so unfamiliar with it, there is no eagerness, no thought, and we think as if we are just statues created by the English. Moreover, we cannot even conceive how much tradition, how much wealth our ancestors have left for us in this country. Now to say that the point is, that this system is fully present within us, fully established. But those who seek truth should first understand that the truth, as it is, cannot be made by you. If you say, "No, we believe that our concept is about the truth," then that cannot be the truth. The truth is what it is. Like a humble student, you should know that, "Right now, we haven't known the truth, so we will know and want to know what the truth is." Until this awakening of thought occurs within us, our self-made mountains, barriers, become very difficult to overcome. What is truth, what is it?

What we call 'truth, truth' – what is truth? Truth is simply that you are the soul. You are not the body, mind, intellect, ego, etc., you are only the soul. You are the soul, and that glow of soul has not yet come into your consciousness or your mind. When this comes into your mind, then you will know that this soul is within us because you will feel it in your nerves, in your central nervous system. For this, you won't have to ask anyone anywhere, you will know it yourself that this thing is happening within you, it is present within you. If I tell you that this creation [separately – come in front, sit in front, come, sit in front] this creation, the animate and inanimate creation, is being carried out with the involvement of some great, heavy force that is completely immersed in this task, you won't believe it. But think can we create such flowers? These flowers turn into fruits; can we produce them? Can we perform any living activity; just perform things that are dead? Understand, if a tree dies and we turn it into a table, we think we've done a great job. We've turned something dead into something dead. And when we turn something dead into something dead, even that inert object sits on our heads. Because there's always a conflict between the inert and the conscious. And the soul, inert always runs away from it. Once you've made a chair, the chair sits on your head because you can't sit anywhere else but on the chair. You have to move around with the chair. Once you develop a habit of something inert, that inert thing sits on your head. This means directly that we are fast influenced by the inert compared to the conscious. And even if we become conscious, we are not as oriented towards the soul; our attention is not drawn towards it. The reason is that we haven't been able to look up that much, we aren't that evolved yet. Now, many people in the world have become such who, by accomplishing great deeds, have explained about the Supreme, about their kingdom, about their greatness, about Kundalini, everything. But this was just theoretical. People think such things that there is nothing like God etc., such talks are going on, people only talk about God and use the name of God to extort money, create disputes, put someone in trouble, sell drugs in temples, etc. They keep doing all sorts of dirty deeds and there is nothing like God. It seems right at the level of intellect. If one thinks from the level of human intellect, it seems that if there is a God, then why are all these spectacles happening? Similarly, once in Algeria, many people thought that if the fundamentalist people come here, they will do the same thing that Khomeini did. Due to this reason, many young people there thought that it would be better for us to embrace communism, only by relying on it can we be saved. So those people became communists - five hundred people established their own communist party. Among them, one lost wanderer reached London and got into Sahaj Yoga. I don't know how he got there, poor guy, and then he transcended. He's a very clever boy, a very pure natured boy - Muslim, but very pure natured. When he found it, he went and said, "No, God exists, but we hadn't found it yet." He got all five hundred people realization and brought them all to London by plane. But the excitement in those people was so tremendous and profound, very intense and deep. Until such inner desire to know the truth exists within a person, they can lose the truth even if they attain it. Therefore, it is hoped that there will be many such people in Jaipur who will be deeply interested in knowing it with great faith, that "What are we, why have we come into this world, why has the Supreme Being given us the human condition, and what is our position beyond this." Knowing this is the truth. Whoever knows this that is the truth? As Adi Shankaracharya has said, "There is only one soul, one Brahman, which is truth, and everything else is an illusion." Now, the discussion about Brahman is like this: currently, as you are understanding this thing, consider this: if you think that this person is very good, it's possible that you are deluded, thinking that this person is a great guru. It could be an illusion; you cannot say with one hundred percent certainty that this thing is absolutely correct. The reason is that you haven't yet attained that solitary thing, that absolute thing, which is your soul. Because when you attain the soul, you don't perceive anything relatively, meaning you don't perceive things as "this is like this, so that is like that," but you have full knowledge that this thing is correct. But what should be its path? How have we found its path in our evolution? Like an animal, if you tell it to walk down a dirty alley, it will go. It won't question whether there's a foul smell or dirtiness; it will just walk straight ahead. But if you tell a human to do the same, they won't be able to. The reason is that your consciousness, your central nervous system (the central nervous system), feels it's dirty. This is something you've found in your evolution. Whatever you've found, you've found in your central nervous system, and in the same way, you should find the soul in your central nervous system too. Otherwise, if people say to themselves, "We are great, we've achieved, we've arrived, we're beyond," and give themselves a certificate like this, then that's not believable. But when something becomes like this, then its powers should also be obtained. Suppose someone says, "I am the governor," then they have their own power of governorship. Similarly, when you attain your soul, you obtain the power of that soul. If you can't attain that power through your central nervous system, then I would say, if it cannot be obtained, if it's just mental exercise, then that's not power. Let's say first you attain collective consciousness. Collective consciousness, also known as collective consciousness, where you can understand the chakras of others, your own chakras, because first and foremost, you attain your own self, your own soul. This is what we call self-realization, meaning you know yourself; you know what faults are within you. Another thing is you can read the signals of your fingers to know the faults in others. This awakening of collective consciousness within your central nervous system, awakening on your nerve centers, is self-realization. It's not about verbal exchanges, it's not about arguments, it's not about wordplay, it's not about someone saying, "You have become Yog-anand, Bhog-anand," it doesn't happen like that. It's not achieved through certificates - it's internal. This action is a living action, it's the action of living energy, which occurs within a living person and which completely confirms and validates them. But we humans tend to get entangled in external things first. This is an event, happening within. Now, many people say that one should wear ochre-colored clothing. By wearing ochre-colored clothing, you become a renunciant. If you dye a cloth for two rupees, will you become a renunciant? By wearing ochre-colored clothing, you're just targeting everyone else's property. How did you become a renunciant? Your eyes are on everyone else's pocket, how did you become a renunciant? Why wear ochre-colored clothing? Wear ochre from within. When you wear ochre from within, externally, you become like King Janak of Videha. Wherever you stay, whether in palaces or in jungles, anywhere – you are an emperor. It means nothing in the world can defeat you, nothing can pull you down, you cannot bow before anyone, and no one can buy you. When you possess such priceless gems, then it should be understood that you have truly achieved something. Otherwise, whoever sees you will purchase you. Whatever they see, they will buy you with money or with something else. So, then what difference remains between you and others? I say, even more than others, it's you who are living on others' money. At least the common person living in the world is living on their own earnings, not on the earnings of others. By wearing the attire of a renunciant, you are living off the earnings of others, so the benefit is that instead of abandoning the clothes, earn by the rules. But most people who cannot earn otherwise resort to this kind of earnings. But there is a delusion in our minds that as soon as we see the monastic attire, we become charmed by it. Especially, this is true of our ladies. Just today, I saw that all the women who had gurus, they didn't attain realization, but their husbands did. When our attention turns towards religion, we tend to accept wrong things as right - these are tamasic tendencies. And when our nature moves away from religion, we don't know what is right and what is wrong. We remain in this dilemma of what is right and what is wrong. For example, in Western countries, people don't even know what is white and what is black. Such people are said to be walking only on the crutch of ego, they say, "I like this, so it's good, I like this." But who is the one who likes it - it's just your ego. When the ego is happy, a person says, "I am happy today." The day the ego is sad, he says, "I am sad." By living on the crutch of ego, humans remain trapped in this cycle, "One moment wealth, another moment ashes." But when you come to your soul, the soul is not only of the nature of truth, but it is also of the nature of bliss. This is the source of happiness, and happiness cannot be obtained from anyone else. If someone says, "My husband is not good, my wife is not good, my father is not good, my mother is not good, that's why I am unhappy or because of society I am unhappy," then one should understand, you are not unhappy because of that, you have not found that source from which happiness comes; that is your soul, which is inherent within you. One should attain this soul, in which there are no dilemmas of pleasure and pain - which is only bliss. One should attain that bliss, because by getting involved in the complexities of pleasure and pain, humans oscillate between happiness and sorrow. That is not an eternal thing. Once it is destroyed, sometimes that is destroyed. Therefore, one should attain the soul, the very nature of which is bliss. The bliss of truth is such that when you attain the soul; you can know what truth is. Imagine someone tells you, "There is a self-manifested deity in such-and-such temple." - Understand if someone said it, it's done. It's possible that they themselves brought and placed it there, saying the self-manifested deity has arrived. How will you know if it's self-manifested? How will you recognize that it's self-manifested?

The way to recognize him is that when you receive it from the soul, then the waves of consciousness, which Adi Shankaracharya has described as the waves of beauty, start flowing from within you. And you can know whether it is real or fake. Once we went to Kashmir. While roaming around Kashmir, at one place, I felt strong waves of consciousness, so I asked the driver "Is there any big old temple here?" He started saying, "No, this is just a jungle." I said, "Okay, let's go this way then." As we passed by, we saw some poor Muslims' huts. So I asked them, "Brother, is there any temple here?" So, they started saying, "No. There's one thing here, Hazratbal." I said, "Okay." Mohammed Sahab's hair was kept there; I caught it five miles away. Even Muslims don't know who fight for him. Namaz (Prayer) is the awakening of the entire Kundalini. Mohammed Sahab described this in their scriptures as ‘Maha Megha’. But what do these Muslims know and what do Hindus know until we attain the soul, we do not know Krishna, nor have we known Ram. When they talk about Akbar, they talk about Shri Krishna, the Virat. Do we know that they have a very close relationship? Jesus Christ clearly said, "Whoever is not against me is with me." Who are these people? Christians can never even think that they are directly Mahavishnu. Their description comes in the Devi Mahatmya. Perhaps very few people have read it - that was the actual Jesus Christ. And Jesus's name is Yesu - Yesu, from Yashoda, and Christ, from Krishna, his mother kept his name. But to understand this, first of all, you must attain the soul. When you attain the soul, you can see whether what we are saying is true or false. If it's false, the consciousness within you will be blocked; if it's true, it will start flowing. If you ask whether there is God or not, then a cool breeze will start blowing strongly in your hands. And if you ask about a wrong person, whether he is right or not, you will know through collective consciousness what kind of person he is. Sometimes, there might even be a small blister in the hand. Yesterday, I got a blister on my hand because a wrong person was going to a wrong guru, so a small blister appeared, indicating that this person kept going to the wrong guru. In this way, you can know who is right, who is wrong, completely within your own consciousness, your own awareness, your own central nervous system, you can know who is right, who is wrong, who is true, who is untrue. You can know all kinds of truths and untruths about this. As you progress, you can know so many things that you couldn't even imagine. Sitting here, you can know everything. The reason is that your telecommunications and so on, their concept is also derived from that universal telecommunications. When you enter into that universal telecommunications, then you can understand everything in the entire creation, that's why it's said to be the seer. Look at Markandeya, how much of a seer he was, but now we have gained knowledge of a great seer from a hundred years ago who was in London. His name was William Blake. He wrote such profound things about spontaneous yoga, ‘Sahaja Yoga’ a hundred years ago, that where this will be in London, where its school will be, where its college will be, where its ashram will be, where my house will be, where I will stay first, then where I will go afterwards. It's astonishing; he was such a great seer and the English people say he was crazy. English people never understand saints and ascetics. They think they have a bad mind. But we, who have known so many saints and ascetics, either they used to lie - or if they spoke the truth, then we should consider our own soul, whether we have attained our soul or not. These words should not be just a trap. If someone comes and spreads a web of words in front of you, engages in conversation, entertains you, then you should inquire from that very person. In this way, you reduce the significance of your spiritual vision. Spiritual vision should be kept only as far as the place of the soul. Until we attain the soul, our spiritual thirst can never be satisfied. For this, at the lowest part of your spine, which we call the sacrum bone, there is a triangular bone, inside it is ‘Power’ called the Kundalini. This power is in the form of three and a half coils, it is in the coils, so it is called Kundalini. You will be surprised that when we went to Greece, Athena - this word comes from 'ath' - ath means primordial - primordial mother Athena and in her hands, she has three and a half coils, giving a circle, she holds Kundalini in her hands. There are countless statues of hers made there. And when we reached her temple, there was a statue of Lord Ganesha placed outside. I asked, "Brother, who is this?" They said, "This is the Child Deity." So I said, "Who told you this?" They started saying, "The Indians told us." I said, "When, when Alexander came?" "No, no, Alexander came much later. We had relations with Indians thousands of years ago." They just connected that thing, and we didn't even know what Kundalini is. Not only that, you will be surprised that the stairs there, they also said, 'These are three and a half.' I asked, "Why?" They said, "The power of Athena is in three and a half rounds, and if you complete these rounds, it will spread all over the Earth. Why are these three and a half, it's a mathematical calculation. Due to this calculation, it is three and a half. We call it Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, and the half measure of the Adi Shakti. In this way, these three and a half are Kundalini. Now if we talk about Mahakali, Mahalakshmi in front of educated people nowadays, they will say, "She's talking about something from the time of Adam and Eve." But what's from the time of Adam and Eve is all true and will remain true; and our only task is to give you the truth. Whether this is proven or not, whether what our ancestors talked about is true or false, whether it was lies or truths, it is for you to verify today. But this verification will come from within you. Only when the soul within you awakens, then this can be verified, otherwise it cannot be. This power is pure will. All our other desires are impure. You must have been taught the law of economics that, 'Personal desires can be satisfied, but generally desires cannot be satisfied.' The meaning of not being satisfiable is that if our desires are pure, then when that desire, if the desire is a pure desire, then after that there should be no desire at all. But because the desire was not pure, therefore one desire arose, then another desire arose – today build a house, tomorrow build a mansion, then buy a third helicopter. But the power of pure desire is one, and that desire is that our union should be with this omnipotent power. This is the pure desire. Until this pure desire is completely integrated, we cannot attain bliss through any worldly desires. But as I mentioned yesterday, there are two meanings of yoga. One meaning is 'yoga' which means union, our union with our soul, our union with our Kundalini, or our union within ourselves with all-pervading power – one this union happens and the other meaning of yoga is skill, expertise. Once this power is awakened within you, you should know what this power is, what its impact is, what its usage is, how it should be utilized, and how its benefits can be obtained. Because Sahaja Yoga, which is today focused socially; today Sahaja Yoga is not just for one or two individuals only. Thousands of individuals need to be transcended – thousands of people can be given realization, that's what Sahaja Yoga is. It is not individualistic to carry one person realized – this is society-oriented. Because its benefits are for society. Firstly, the health of a person is restored without money, without a doctor, without diagnosis, without anything. Mental health is restored; financial health is restored, because the element of prosperity is corrected. In our country, people say, "You have so much yoga power within you, you are such yogis, so spiritual, why are you poor?" Because in our country, no one has ever achieved yoga. No politician has ever attained yoga; they keep wandering in useless pursuits – until today, who has attained yoga? When yoga is attained in one's own country, then Lord Krishna has clearly said, "Yogakshem vahāmayam." First attain yoga. When Sudama went to meet Lord Krishna, that's when he attained prosperity. Similarly, until we enter the kingdom of the Supreme Soul, it is not the responsibility of the Supreme Soul to look after our welfare. Right now, it is the responsibility of those who are in power. When you enter the kingdom of the Supreme Soul, then it becomes the responsibility of the Supreme Soul to provide you with welfare. This does not mean that they shower money on you – that would be very wrong. But you attain such a state that in contentment, you acquire so much that you no longer face any difficulties and now have no demands. You start saying, "I don't need anything now, Mother, and I am swimming in the ocean of joy." Not only that, your sense of righteousness awakens within you. If I tell you, "Don't do this, don't do that," you will definitely do it. This is a special trait of humans. If someone says, "Don't do this," then why not do it, they will surely do it. Therefore, it is better to awaken Kundalini within you, awaken the sense of righteousness within you, and you become righteous on your own. That is, Jesus Christ didn't have to tell them not to do wrong deeds. They themselves didn't do it. Similarly, righteousness awakens within you on its own; we don't have to say anything. Today's Sahaja Yoga is special in this regard that no matter what kind of person someone is, awaken their Kundalini first. If even a little flicker of light starts swirling inside them, they will see, "What turmoil is within me?" Make them their own guru; let them keep correcting themselves so that there is no conflict with me. They will themselves know that these faults are within them, and they will rectify themselves. Whenever a snake is seen in the hand, it is not thrown away immediately; if someone says, "There's a snake," you won't be the one to throw it away. Therefore, if even a little light shines within a person, they start to see that light is something. And beyond this, there is a divine power. When he starts to understand such things on his own, things that he didn't consider wrong before, he immediately discards them. This should happen naturally. Until this happens, through speeches, explanations, teachings, nothing will happen. Today, Sahaja Yoga is at a level where I can say that its impact will be known to people very soon. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to visit Jaipur yet. And even if I did visit Jaipur, it would be on that specific day, which we call "Gudi Padwa" in Marathi, the day when King Shalivahana established it in Hindustan. But in reality, as you know, they went to rule in Maharashtra, and their lineage was specifically from Jaipur. I came here on that very day, and I am from that lineage too; I am also a Rajput, but over the years, for thousands of years, due to living there, all the descendants of Shalivahana have become Maharashtrians. In a way, it's good because as much as some people in Maharashtra know about Kundalini, no one in the rest of Hindustan, or the world, knows. The Nath sects have put in so much effort there—whatever is written about Kundalini in the Marathi language, you won't find it written in any other language. Although Kabir Das wrote quite a bit, not many people read it. It's a continuous text; they continue with their continuous reading. Someone comes; they point a finger, "Brother, you read now." Then someone else comes, they point a finger. The continuous reading goes on. No one thinks about what's inside. Nanak wrote, "Says Nanak, without self-realization, doubt is not dispelled." They're singing, "Doubt is not dispelled." Hey brother, take the medicine that's prescribed. If you roam around with the prescription they've given, what's the benefit? The prescription itself says, "Doubt is not dispelled." But who will take it, who will do it? Everyone has said, "Attain self-realization." When we become Hindus, the initiators like Shankaracharya, they have always said, "Neither in Yoga nor in Sankhya; leave all these useless things aside, first attain the soul - it happens only by the grace of the Mother." But where do people believe them? Who knows what kind of skepticism they are sitting with, who knows what they have started?

The fundamental essence of all this, even though it exists within Hinduism, has turned Hinduism into a strange medium for conflict. What could be a means for peace for the entire world, what could guide the entire world towards happiness, is being wielded like a sword, which could be the shield for the entire world. I am greatly astonished by what is happening. Talking to your big leaders about its fundamental essence, it's surprising to see that they are not even aware that the fundamental essence of all this is to attain the soul and awaken the Kundalini. It is not written as explicitly in any religious scriptures as it is in our scriptures. And it is written in places - like in the Bible, it is written in many places that it is called the Tree of Life. "I will be present before you like the flames of fire," it is said. Many things are said elsewhere, but as clearly and systematically as Markandeya said, Adi Shankaracharya said, or Kabir Das ji, Nanak ji said, no one else has said. But whose mind is there? Our mind gets attracted to such places, where it should not go to. Because, as I have told you, everything that has happened with these people is external. As a tree grows and even when it reaches such a height, if its roots do not go deep within, then there is an apprehension of it falling. Your entire Western world is sitting in this shock today. But in Hindustan, its roots are there, all its heritage is in Hindustan, obtain it, you are its rightful heirs. You have performed many virtuous deeds to be born on this land of India. Besides that, you cannot be born on this land. And what have you done for this country? Such a profound thing of it that you have not found it, have not recognized it? It should be known, it should be attained. This work can be done in a moment. And that's why I have come to you, so that you can attain it. Everything is yours - your Kundalini is your mother. She is your birth-giver. Your souls are within you, which are the light of the Supreme. All this wealth is yours to attain; we have nothing to do with it. I hope I will come to Jaipur again and again. Here, I have seen many people recognize the Divine with devotion, and this work will progress further. If you have any questions today, feel free to ask. It would be good to ask a few more questions, and then we will plan its program, so that everyone can attain that soul with which the conversation has happened.

Seeker: You mentioned that we should attain the soul, but you didn't explain how to attain the soul?

Shri Mataji: Yes, you are indeed true seekers. They are the ones who will do it. Alright. They have already asked this question, which is very good. This is the recognition of a real seeker, that they want to know, "First tell me about the activity of the soul. Mother, I am hungry, give me food." This is the real thing. It's a very good thing.

Seeker: And another thing is, the chakras you mentioned, to explain them (vaguely), what is their physical existence inside or is it just our imagination that they exist like this?

Shri Mataji: No, it's real, my child, it's real. Physical, mental, emotional - it's real, power, meaning, reservoirs of power.

Seeker: Is there a physical form?

Shri Mataji: It is also a physical form. It's physical in the sense that in that place, where your chakra gets imbalanced, you will see that the bumps on your back will come out. It also works physically, but they are reservoirs of power, those are reservoirs of power.

Seeker: The three and a half coils, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Seeker: Where? Which place is it?

Shri Mataji: Where? They are describing the three and a half coils.

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Seeker: Where is this? Is it near which bone?

Shri Mataji: I am telling you, it's inside the sacrum bone - the triangular bone that is there, inside it. Look down here. Below the lower back, below the spine bone, there is a triangular bone inside. Seeker: Inside it?

Shri Mataji: Yes, inside it, there is this power.

Seeker: Where this resides, the Meru...

Shri Mataji: Below the spinal cord.

Seeker: Inside.

Shri Mataji: Yes, below the spinal cord, there is this power, but the spinal cord is also there; consider that as the base of the spinal cord.

Seeker: Where does it meet with the anus?

Shri Mataji: No, above that. The triangular bone is above - it's above that.

Seeker: Is it necessary to cleanse the nadis before Kundalini awakening?

Shri Mataji: No, it's not necessary, not required at all.

Seeker: Is transfer of power necessary for Kundalini awakening?

Shri Mataji: No, not at all. This talk about needing power, it's a new disease. Absolutely not required. I got quite flustered hearing this. Just sit down. Let me explain what they are saying, brother, they must understand this talk about needing power; I am a mother, I get quite anxious. Then a gentleman came. He started telling me about "Arunoday, Barunoday," I said where did this come from, Bhai? So he started saying, "They are spreading, they wrote a book that says one must attain power." I said, "Look, you are a Brahmin by caste," - they were Brahmins by caste. "You should understand one thing that whatever knowledge there is, it too has been attained through evolution. It also has its own tradition. You just pick one out of the middle. Like Rajneesh took out Neo-Sannyas, someone else took out something else (unclear), they took out a third. In this way, you cannot invent anything new. If flowers are to bloom on a tree, they come from the root before the branches, then the flowers bloom, which is a living process." But they just pick it up from here, attain power, somewhere holding this - all this is not described in the scriptures - we shouldn't believe in such things. But this appeals to intellectuals because it comes with novelty.

Novelty is there. Today, Sahaj Yoga has also come with novelty but it has its foundation. It should be practical. Until its foundation is not there, it doesn't make any sense.

Seeker: Why is there a need for a Guru in this?

Shri Mataji: Yes, there is a need for a Guru, but understand that the Mother is a kind of Guru as well. But we don't consider ourselves as Seekers because just now you said, "Mother, you've come, so how can we sit?" Alright, you said that. But one doesn't just stand before the Mother. She is the Mother. Even if you sit on her head, she is still the Mother, even if you come to her feet, she is still the Mother. There is a big difference between a Mother and a Guru, a very big difference. We see some Gurus - they are in poor health, those who are real. They ruin the condition of  one by one.

Seeker: Is this above the [unclear] or in the [unclear] mouth?

Shri Mataji: In what? On the shishna (spine). Yes, you said this point correctly, you said this point correctly. It's very important, let me explain it to you. So, have you understood? No, then. Your point is indeed very confusing. Whether it's above or below - it's above. Below, there is the Muladhara chakra where Lord Ganesha sits. Above is the place of Gauri, which is that of a virgin. People have made a big mess of this because, due to being in the form of the Mother, we won't outrightly say that they were so wicked, but due to misunderstanding, they might have understood the trunk of Lord Ganesha as the Kundalini, because what they have seen is from the outside, they haven't gone inside. But this is pure knowledge, pure Kanya (virgin), which is Gauri sitting there.

Shri Mataji: This is all what they teach, sitting on the shishna (spine)? This is all there is.

Seeker: One more thing, sir, that we have a few educated people here. Magazines, books, etc., a few people read them. These days, within our country India, where 80% of the people are not aware of ABCD, they spend their lives working from morning till evening, passing 80 or 70 years of their lives. So what does it mean that the lives of these people have gone completely wasted?

Shri Mataji: No, not at all, absolutely not.

Seeker: What are your comments on that?

Shri Mataji: No, no, most of them come to Sahaja Yoga, depending on those who have time. Those who have time stay in clubs. Those who don't have time, they come here. But a special feature of Sahaja Yoga is that when you attain it – as most sons work in villages and less in cities – and when people come to villages, they get transformed, all their bad habits disappear, all their addictions vanish, and they become so dynamic that you don't need to ask anything. Once we were going like this into the fields; we saw one field shimmering. We asked, 'Whose field is this?' They said, 'It belongs to a Sahaja Yogi.' I said, "Okay, what did he do?" They said, "Nothing, Mother, I just sprinkled a little charnamrit in it, and it started shimmering with its vibrations. So, there was an Austrian Sahaja Yogi; I told him, "Okay, you experiment with this." He experimented, and he was so amazed that when he gave plain water – he had done it on maize, which is called corn; the corn plant was so tall that when he vibrated the water, it became so tall – he took photographs of it. And he is a very prominent scientist, who is employed in the UN.

And he has written a paper on it; we are going to send it to the Government of India. But who will inquire there, who will see it. They don't have time. Everyone has other diseases. No one has time here. Those who work all day, they have time for God.

Seeker: It is said that a person who earns his bread in less than twenty-four hours mostly thinks about these things.

Shri Mataji: Nonsense!

Seeker: What is God, what is divinity?

Shri Mataji: No, no, they think less about them.

Seeker: A person who works hard from morning till evening.

Shri Mataji: He thinks more, son.

Seeker: While keeping work in front and not paying attention to anything else. Is it considered that such a person's life, with the help of some higher power, avoids the cycle of rebirth?

Shri Mataji: No, no, it's not like that. The people who work a lot, those you are referring to as work-alcoholics - you're not talking about them?

Seeker: No, ma'am. I mean the people in rural areas.

Shri Mataji: No - I mean the people in rural areas.

Seeker: Yes, ma'am.

Shri Mataji: The people in rural areas. Our country resides in rural areas. Yes, so the people in rural areas, they easily transcend and become dynamic after that. But those who are work-alcoholics in cities, no one can treat them - they themselves cannot treat it, they are useless. But others, who have more leisure than necessary, like those who always roam around wearing watches, ask them, "I want to go to London." "Why, why so much fuss?"

"I have to attend a ball there." Half the time - imagine - we, now, our age, now sixty-sixth years is going on; we have seen a lot of life. Earlier, there were neither so many parties nor anything - real friendships used to exist. Nowadays, there are parties every day. Go to someone's house for dinner, go to someone else's house for dinner. In London, you have to attend five receptions. After making arrangements to waste time completely, what can we say, that we don't have time? Time has become too much because everything has become so convenient. All your things have become so convenient - your food starts cooking easily, you get things so easily, but arrangements for wasting time have also become a lot.

We waste so much time from morning till evening without any limit. But if someone thinks that they need to give a little time for the Divine, then even in that moment, even in a fraction of a moment, the Divine can be with you. You speak.

Seeker: Mother, children are born through sex.

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Seeker: Children are born only through sex, it can be said, but you said something as if it's undesirable.

Shri Mataji: Mother gives birth through sex - that's a wrong statement, son. The statement became wrong, the statement is wrong.

Seeker: Existence is there. (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: No, no, I didn't say sex is a bad thing, I didn't say that. But sex happens with the wife, not with the mother.

Seeker: It gives birth to children.

Shri Mataji: Yes, giving birth to children is not the job of sex. Giving birth to children is not the job of sex. Sex happens between husband and wife, not with the children. With children, there is a sacred relationship.

Seeker: Mother is also a wife.

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Seeker: Mother is also a wife.

Shri Mataji: She is a wife, but it's a sacred relationship. With a mother, there is sanctity, this should be acknowledged.

Seeker: Through Kundalini awakening, does internal warmth increase (unclear)?

Shri Mataji: Nothing, absolutely nothing happens. Go to the wrong people who play with the Mother, they experience it. It happens to those who do wrong deeds. It happens to those who indulge in such things, whose character is not upright. Those people, you never know what they might say or do - I once saw a gentleman here who had blisters all over. He started saying, "My Kundalini is awakened." Another gentleman was running around like crazy. I asked, "What happened?" He said, "My Kundalini is awakened." I asked, "How?" He said, "It feels like someone is cutting me with a razor; all the razors are cutting into my body." And people were wandering around the world like crazy. I asked, "Where did they go?" They said, "They went to Mr. So-and-so, so he awakened my Kundalini." So I said, "His got awakened?" They said, "His also got awakened like that." I said, "Oh! Then why did you go to him?" When his Kundalini got awakened like that, he would do the same to you. Brother, when someone in front is behaving like that, why did you go to him? But humans are quite strange. A person comes to the bar, falls in front of it, and yet it moves forward, leaping over him. What can we say about human intelligence?

Seeker: Indeed, they are somewhat like that, as if a fly is being cut, as if something is drawing a man towards spirituality.

Shri Mataji: Yes, if you go towards the wrong thing, it will happen. If you cross the limit, it will happen. It does happen, right? Everything in the world exists, but that is the wrong thing, right? From the wrong thing...

Seeker: (Unclear) Isn't it that Kundalini is awakening, if something like this is happening, then a state like cutting a fly comes, then does it have any recognition that, 'Yes, this is awakened'?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, absolutely not. One way to recognize it is that there is cool air coming from your head, cool air in your hands - this is its recognition. All around there is this coolness - 'Salilam, Salilam' description. 'Salilam, Salilam' feels cool all around.

Seeker: Does any pain arise in the body like this?

Shri Mataji: No, nothing at all, how can there be pain, this is your mother. It's all...

Seeker: Not pain, like this trembling, trembling arises?

Shri Mataji: No, it shouldn't happen. If there's something wrong inside, there might be a little trembling. A little bit. If there's something wrong inside, in correcting it, there might be a little trembling, but it's not painful.

Seeker: This Kundalini awakening that happens, is it temporary or permanent?

Shri Mataji: It's permanent, dear.

Seeker: (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: Yes, and what else?

Seeker: What is its practice?

Seeker: Its technique?

Shri Mataji: That's what I've come to tell you. The technique.

Seeker: (Conversation between Seekers)

Seeker: So, when something happens, then we'll know. How did you start this in the beginning?

Shri Mataji: You need to answer their questions first. You're saying it correctly. Absolutely, you're right.

Seeker: We used to sit in school first, wanting to write "Kakka Shri Ram Ji" first - these are big things.

Shri Mataji: Big thing - why say big thing, you're saying the right thing. Bhai! If you need to light a lamp, tell me, where's the button, fix it. Later, we'll learn where the light came from, what happened. You're saying the right thing. You're a very right person. This is what I say, that this is in the villages of Hindustan.

Seeker: Now the big proof of this will be when this experience comes, there will be no doubt in it.

Shri Mataji: Yes!

Seeker: The brain or mind will automatically say that it happened.

Shri Mataji: That's it. Just give us your certificate, we don't need to give you one. Let's be straightforward. There are many people here who have had the experience. But you haven't had it yet. And it's true, what's the point of discussing experience if it's void? That's all a discussion about void experience - so attain the experience. As you said, you're elderly and wise. It's a matter of wisdom, absolutely a matter of wisdom.

Seeker: I read about you that you can make someone feel it by touching.

Shri Mataji: Oh, there's no need for that. If that has been done to someone, they might have written about it, but there's no need for touching.

Seeker: Many years ago, I read somewhere, five, seven, ten, twelve years ago.

Shri Mataji: Yes, there might be some tough souls who need to be touched. What to do, sometimes you have to exert your hands.

Seeker: Is there a necessary state for awakening the Kundalini energy? (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Seeker: Is there a state required to awaken the Kundalini energy?

Shri Mataji: No, not at all.

Seeker: Because in childhood or in a specific life (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: No, not at all, dear.

Seeker: Not even for a child?

Shri Mataji: Everyone's. Children's is the first. Alright, now these gentlemen are saying something else, if not then their words... The point is, when the awakening starts, you will search and any questions – not asked, that not asked, so first let's satisfy you. Yes, please proceed.

Seeker: What connection is there in Kundalini and the soul?

Shri Mataji: What are you saying?

Sahaja Yogi: What is the relationship between Kundalini and the soul?

Shri Mataji: Kundalini, which is, is the primordial power; the reflection of the primordial power within us. And the primordial power, which is, is the power of the Divine. And the reflection of the Divine is the soul within us. Understand? The power of the Divine is the primordial power. The power of Sadashiva is called the primordial power – the power of the Divine.

Seeker: (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: What are you saying?

Sahaja Yogi: Is the search for the soul and the search for Kundalini the same thing?

Shri Mataji: What is the search for Kundalini for? It is to awaken it, and through that search, it brings your soul and awakens it within you. There is no need to search for it. No need to search for anything.

Seeker: Like when Kundalini awakens (unclear)

Shri Mataji: Kundalini?

Seeker: Like when Kundalini starts moving forward.

Shri Mataji: Yes?

Seeker: So the chakras of the path won't remain intact?

Shri Mataji: Chakras of the path?

Sahaja Yogi: If Kundalini starts striking the Agnya Chakra, then the chakras of the path—

Seeker: —won't remain intact.

Shri Mataji: They all have to open up. If the Agnya Chakra is caught, it has to be opened. Let's see where the Kundalini is; the work is to open everything, that's the task.

Seeker: Can one reach the Sahasrara Chakra directly?

Shri Mataji: They will take you directly to your Sahasrara; what's the matter with the Agnya Chakra?

Seeker: The chakras of the path must all be clear for that to happen (unclear).

Shri Mataji: Yes?

Seeker: The chakras in the path.

Shri Mataji: She will immediately pierce through all of them and come out from here (unclear).

Seeker: Won't she go straight to the Agnya Chakra?

Shri Mataji: No, no, it will come out from here, sir—from the palate, from the Brahmarandhra. It will come out from the Brahmarandhra, it pierces through the palate, it pierces through the six chakras—it doesn't stop at the Agnya Chakra, it's just a window, it comes out from here. Alright, sit down. You know something...

Seeker: If it comes out, then should we consider all chakras to be fine?

Shri Mataji: Yes, these people sitting here, two or four, theirs has come out, you can ask them.

Seeker: Could imbalance occur in someone by doing this practice?

Shri Mataji: What can't happen?

Sahaja Yogi: Imbalance.

Shri Mataji: Oh no sir, you become balanced—you think what imbalance could occur?

Seeker: Is it necessary for every individual, upon achieving realization, to achieve equilibrium in themselves?

Shri Mataji: Why not?

Seeker: There might be some individuals who cannot attain it and might distort themselves.

Shri Mataji: Distorted? How would that happen?

Seeker: I'm asking you.

Shri Mataji: You're speaking as if you've understood. Suppose you've sown a seed. When that seed sprouts, how could it become distorted?

Seeker: Some seeds don't even sprout, sir.

Shri Mataji: No, they don't sprout. That's true. Some people don't transcend; that's true. If they don't today, they will tomorrow; if not tomorrow, the day after. We are committed to the effort. What's there to be anxious about? You are worrying unnecessarily. You will make it across. Just cross over first. That's it. Alright, what's the matter?

Seeker: The method of awakening.

Shri Mataji: What are you saying?

Sahaj Yogi: The method of awakening?

Shri Mataji: That's what they are saying. Right now, they're not even giving time for that. First, they're talking about this and that. Alright, let it be. That point is fine. What you're saying is correct, that awakening should happen first, and nothing else is needed; they are speaking the truth. That's it. Yes, some people can sit in front comfortably.

Seeker: Completely at ease.

Shri Mataji: There's nothing to be anxious about. There's nothing to worry about. No one will face any discomfort. Sit in front, sit here. I must surely make you transcend. Sit here. Come. Pull back some chairs from behind. Sit as forward as you can, if not, sit as comfortably as you can. There's no issue with that. But if you can come forward as much as possible, it would be good.

Seeker: Let those who are behind come forward to the front chairs.

Shri Mataji: Now, as we say, you do it, because you will awaken your Kundalini yourselves, we won't do it directly, it's a straightforward account. And how to do it, we will explain. Turn your left hand towards us. Comfortably. In your lap, in your lap, the left one. We say left and right for this reason, because some say it's this hand, some say it's the other hand. People say different things. In the Hindi language, it's said differently in every province. That's why we say left and right. Or else, the other hand, the other hand towards us. Straightforward, like this.

Seeker: How far forward should we go?

Shri Mataji: Just sit comfortably in your lap, relax. Everything will come effortlessly. Sahaja means it's born with you - naturally. Just like this, comfortably, comfortably. And the right hand that we have, we will use it because it's the power of desire, and this one here is the power of action. We'll use it and place it on different chakras. How? We'll show you. It's quite easy. First, we'll place our hand on our heart. After that, we'll place it on the upper part of the abdomen. I will explain what this chakra is myself. After that, we'll place it on the lower part of the abdomen. Then again, we'll place it back on the upper part of the abdomen. All the work will be done on the left-hand side. Everyone should do it, please. If it doesn't happen now, we'll say later, it didn't happen. After that, we'll place it on the heart. Then here, on the Vishuddhi Chakra, in this spot, we'll hold the hand like this, from the front. After that, we'll grip it partially on the forehead, press it. At the back, here, we'll hold it like this. Then on the head, this palate, placing it evenly on the spot of the palate, pressing it and rotating it seven times. Press it like this, with fingers like this. That's it, after this, it will be done.

Seeker: How do we rotate it?

Shri Mataji: Place it like this, press and rotate it. No, no, no, no. Rotate your hand like this, pressing it. Like this, as I'm rotating, like this. Alright. Even if you don't do this, it will still work - you all are great saints. There's no need to worry. First, the left hand should face towards me and the right hand should be placed on the ground. Now, as I mentioned earlier, you're sitting on the yoga ground, so you need to receive the blessings of this Mother. You've placed your left hand on the ground. It's possible that someone's hand might start feeling cool. Now, turn your right hand towards me, for balance, and the left hand like this. Right hand towards me - this is just for balance. Also, remove your glasses because now you'll need to keep your eyes closed all the time. Now, turn your left hand towards me. Now, close your eyes. Left hand towards me and close your eyes. After this, do not open your eyes. Until I say so, do not open your eyes because this is internal meditation. Everyone, please do it. Do not sit here to look. Everyone should do this - do not sit here to look. Those who need to sit only, are requested with folded hands to leave. There's nothing to see here; please take your leave with courtesy. Those who need to meditate should sit, as others get disturbed. So please, everyone stay focused, please. No, please be courteous;

Sadhak: Should I place my hand over the head?

Shri Mataji: No, the left hand like this. Please be courteous - there is no need to force it. If you don't want to meditate, then you may leave.

Sadhak: Please wait for five minutes.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Sadhak: Please wait for five minutes.

Shri Mataji: Why, what's the matter?

Sadhak: They have gone outside, please let them come in (indistinct).

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Sadhak: Their husbands have gone outside.

Sadhak: They have gone outside, please let them come in.

Sadhak: Maybe they went for the washroom.

Shri Mataji: Alright, let them stay. No problem. Let them come. Whenever they come, it will be fine. Don't worry. Look at this eagerness. Look at this simplicity. Look at this simplicity. Until a person embraces this simplicity, nothing can happen with them. People who don't live in simplicity get stuck in all the troubles of life. Cancer, its disease, their disease - all these things affect them. Okay, now no one's turn. Now, the left hand should be placed towards me - like this, keep the left hand. Now, place the right hand on the heart. Close your eyes. In the heart resides your soul, so ask me a question three times - with complete faith, "Mother, am I the soul?"; ask in your mind, "Mother, am I the soul?" Ask in your mind from the depths of your heart. You should have complete faith in yourself. Now, with this same right hand, you, on the left side, above the abdomen, place it. This is the chakra of the guru principle. Because you are the soul, you become your own guru. So, ask another question in this sequence, "Mother, am I my own guru?" - ask this three times. You are asking me very fundamental questions. "Am I my own guru? Mother, am I my own guru?" Why aren't you doing it, Bhai? Do it, it will be beneficial. Turn the left hand towards me and place the right hand on the abdomen. Left hand on the left side, please. Ask the question three times. Now, with this right hand - keep your eyes closed and remove your glasses because it will have a good effect on the eyes. Now, with this right hand, place it on the lower part of the abdomen. Now, understand one thing, you should be cheerful. You have to enter the court of the Divine, you should remain cheerful. Leaving aside fear, doubt, and so on, you should remain cheerful, and at this place where you have placed your hand, there is the Swadhisthana Chakra, and through this chakra, you know pure knowledge, the knowledge by which you should operate the Brahman Shakti, you know all about it. But for this pure knowledge, I cannot force you; you will have to say, "Mother, give me this pure knowledge." I cannot force you. I have to honor your freedom completely, so you have to say in your freedom, "Mother, give me pure knowledge," - say it six times. There are six petals of this chakra - like the petals of a lotus, there are six petals, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." Keep your eyes closed, do not open them. Please do not open your eyes at all. It's internal, the mind should be inward. Now, this right hand, you should place it again on the upper part of the abdomen, where I said the Guru's chakra was - on the left-hand side. All the work is happening on the left-hand side. Now reassure your Kundalini. The Kundalini has awakened, but you have to reassure it so that it rises upwards. At this place, say with full confidence, "Mother, I am my own guru." Say it with complete faith, without any doubt, "Mother, I am my own guru." Take off your hat or any head covering, because in front of Mother, what is there to cover and then its Brahmarandhra that need be opened (the opening at the crown of the head), right? Say, "Mother, I am my own guru," ten times. There are ten guru principles within us - say it ten times. Say it with complete faith. "I am indeed my own guru." Now, place this right hand on the heart. I have told you that the soul resides in the heart. Say with complete faith, "Mother, I am the soul." With full faith, "Mother, I am the soul." Twelve times. Hmmm.

Seeker: Should we open our eyes?

Shri Mataji: No, no, keep your eyes closed.

Seeker: You speak ahead.

Shri Mataji: Yes, alright; now you calm down a bit, because all  have to be seen, everyone, take everyone along. Let the Kundalini settle down to everyone's heart chakra, then we'll proceed further, okay? You stay relaxed. There's no need to rush, take it easy. Walk with everyone. Okay? Don't open your eyes. Now place your hand on your forehead - on your Vishuddhi Chakra. The Vishuddhi Chakra, which is at the corner of our neck and shoulder, on the left side - grip it firmly. Take your hand to the back a bit, a little further. And grip it firmly. This chakra catches us when we constantly consider ourselves guilty - 'we are sinful, we are fallen, this and that.' Bhai! Now don't look at others, you attain yourself. Attain yourself. Keep your hand like this, here. Place the right hand here. No, not left, right hand. From this side, tell them too, they are also important. Take their hand from the front. Yes, turn it from the neck, yes, from the front. Tell them too. Yes, now all of you say that, "Mother, I am not guilty, I have committed no fault. I am not fallen, sinful in any way. I am the soul, pure soul."

Seeker: How many times?

Shri Mataji: Sixteen times. This is the place of Shri Krishna. You should know that God is not just a source of love, not just a source of compassion, but the greatest source of forgiveness. And we cannot commit any mistake that God cannot completely destroy through His forgiveness. Therefore, considering oneself guilty is very wrong, so say completely that, "Mother, I am absolutely not guilty, I have not done any wrong deed. I am not fallen, I am not sinful - I am a pure soul, a pure soul," while placing your hand here. It is very important.

Seeker: The fingers of the left hand are burning.

Shri Mataji: That's because of some disturbance, nothing serious. It will go away in a little while. It will go away, it will go away. There's no need to worry. Okay, say it sixteen times. Now, with full heart, whether it's just once or twice - but with full heart, place your hand on top of your head, where the crown is, and press from both sides - like when we have a headache, we press. At this place, say with full heart - whether it's twice or thrice - that, "Mother, I have forgiven everyone." Say it with full heart. No, no, place it on the crown, not on the head. What do you call the crown?

Seeker: Forehead.

Shri Mataji: Forehead. No, what do you call it?

Seeker: Forehead, forehead.

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Seeker: The forehead, which is called.

Shri Mataji: They're not understanding forehead, are they?

Seeker: Forehead, forehead.

Shri Mataji: Forehead. Forehead is a very beautiful word. I thought it would be a little Sanskrit, that's why. Yes! Place it on the forehead. "I have forgiven everyone," because when we don't forgive someone, we do nothing, and even when we do, we still do nothing. But when we don't forgive, then surely someone who is troubling us, bothering us, plays into their hands. So please say with full heart, "Mother, we have forgiven." Don't say, "It's difficult." Just say it outright, "Mother, I have forgiven." Seeker: How many times should we say it?

Shri Mataji: Say it from the heart. I will know myself whether you said it or not. It's not about how many times. Say it once, say it twice, but say it with full heart. Yes! Now, take this right hand towards the back. Now, without blaming yourself even once, without counting sins, without counting any mistakes, once ask forgiveness from the Divine, saying, "If I have ever, even unintentionally, said or done anything against your glory, please forgive me. You are our Father." Close your eyes, remove your glasses. Close your eyes - hold it here. Seeker: How many times should we say this?

Shri Mataji: That's it. Now, place this hand above the palate. Put it on the instep. You know where the instep is, right? Where the fontanels are located, and press it. And rotate it seven times. At this point, I also respect your freedom that you have to say, "Mother, help me transcend. Mother, grant me self-realization." I cannot force you. [Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.] [Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.] [Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.] [Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.] [Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.] [Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.] [Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.] Now slowly lower your hands. With both hands towards me, slowly open your eyes, very slowly. Now, lift your left hand four inches, five inches above your head, to see if there is any cool breeze – keep the left hand, keep the left hand, and the right hand towards me. Turn the right hand towards me. Like I have done above the instep, left, left here. See if there is any cool breeze coming? Take off your hat, son. Yes – take off the necklace too, it will be better. If you are wearing a necklace, take it off, that's why I said there is a burning sensation. Take off the necklace for a minute. Just keep it in front for a minute. That's it, okay – now see, the burning sensation will go away. Yes! Look upwards, about 4-6 inches above. Yes! You give yourself the certificate, I won't give it. You have achieved it. Now, turn the right hand towards me and see with the left hand. You people are feeling quite warm. Right hand – see with the left hand.

Seeker: First the right hand (indistinct).

Shri Mataji: Turn the right hand towards me, like this, a bit higher. Yes! And see with the left hand first. Okay, now turn the left hand towards me and see with the right hand. (Indistinct). Got it? Is it coming? It's a very subtle thing. Did it come? Yes, upwards.

Seeker: No, nothing is there.

Shri Mataji: It will come, it will come, it will come, there's too much restlessness in you. It will come, change your hands. If it doesn't come, we will cross over. No problem – yes. Say, "Mother, come into my head," for whom it's not coming. Say it. Right now, Kundalini is your mother, she will come. Yes, has it come?

Seeker: No, it hasn't.

Shri Mataji: Is it coming? Has it come for you? It's coming. Is it coming?

Seeker: Not feeling it.

Shri Mataji: Huh? Seeker: I'm not feeling it yet.

Shri Mataji: Not feeling it yet – it will come, it will come. Has it come, son?

Seeker: A little bit.

Shri Mataji: Yes! Alright. Now let's do one more thing. If you don't feel it in your hand, raise your hand and move your neck back and ask, "Is this the same divine power that is spoken of?" "Is this the conscious power of the Divine by which all living functions happen?" Ask three times. Now lower your hand. Now see. Did it come, did you feel it in your hand? Yes! Now for the first time, you felt this power all around.

Seeker: I didn't feel anything.

‘Shri Mataji: It will happen, dear. You worry too much, don't worry. Let's do it now; let's see you now.

Seeker: Maybe it will take time.

Shri Mataji: It won't take time. Don't panic. Those who will take time, will take time. Have you felt it?

Seeker: It's difficult to say anything precisely.

Shri Mataji: Yes, now, just see. Those who aren't feeling it precisely, let's check on them now.

Seeker: What does it feel like in the hand?

Shri Mataji: Are you feeling it?

Seeker: What does it feel like in the hand?

Shri Mataji: It feels like cool air in the hand. Did you feel it in the head?

Seeker: In the head, it's (unclear).

Shri Mataji: It will happen now. Please sit down, relax a bit, and be calm. They have felt it, they have felt it, and they have felt it. Alright, those who felt it in the hand, raise your hands up, both hands, both hands. Now, see, so many people have felt it. Alright, for those who didn't, there's no need to panic. Everyone has to achieve it. Come on, come up, andlet’s go one by one, one by one, we'll see everyone.

Sahaja Yogi: Come from this side, this way, come here, and come from this side.

Shri Mataji: One by one. It has to be on the foot.

Sahaja Yogi: Come one by one.

Shri Mataji: Come on, one by one, come on. Come on the foot. Who among you went to the guru first?

Sadhu: We were at our Guru Acharya Shri Ram Sharma's place.

Shri Mataji: That's where you're getting stuck. It's not right, that's why. Keep your right hand on your stomach, here. Now say, "Mother, I am my own Guru." Say it completely.

Sadhu: Mother, I am my own Guru.

Shri Mataji: Open your eyes.

Sadhu: Mother, I am my own Guru.

Shri Mataji: The principle of the Guru is messed up, say it again.

Sadhu: Mother, I am my own Guru.

Shri Mataji: Again. Say it with your eyes open.

Sadhu: Mother, I am my own Guru.

Shri Mataji: Yes!

Sadhu: Mother, I am my own Guru. Mother

Shri Mataji: It didn't happen for you? Look carefully, it's caught on the Agnya. It will open. It's the grip of the Agnya that's coming. Yes, is something coming? It will come. Come here, sit down. Boys, look. Come. Yes, come. Now leave the one with the beads.

"Let go of all the trickery and deceitful mind games – come. Everyone has said everything, we keep cramming and don't do anything. Yes – the Agnya? Come. You are really stuck on the Agnya – where did you go?"

Sadhu: Me? For the Ajna Chakra (unclear).

Shri Mataji: With Rajneesh – yes.

Sahaja Yogi: Exactly!

Shri Mataji: Yes, indeed.

Sahaja Yogi: Whose?

Sahaja Yogi: I've read a lot of books by Rajneesh.

Shri Mataji: That's where the confusion has come from. Let's hit it with a bullet. 'Ravana Mardini'. Yes, put your hands down. This is Ravana's incarnation, understand. Who can be a person who rises against the dignity of women? Only a demon. Yes!

Came, came? Ascended, ascended. Now understand the matter. You are amazing for sitting in front of me. Ask these others. Three came, they froze right there – poor souls couldn't even get up. Alright, how are you doing? Your health isn't okay?

Seeker: I'm fine. Nothing serious, though.

Shri Mataji: It's your liver. Complaints related to the liver. Hmm, alright, you sit down. Tell them what to do for the liver. Didn't you feel it?

Seeker: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Alright, hold your hand like this. What is it, what is it?

Seeker: It hasn't come yet.

Shri Mataji: It will come, don't panic. Went to the wrong guru – no worries. Relax a bit – let everyone come in.

Sahaja Yogi: You didn't feel it?

Seeker: Look carefully.

Sahaja Yogi: Still not felt?

Seeker: (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: What are you saying? Is it coming? Yes, keep it like this. Hasn't it come yet? Right, tell me about the liver. Come here. Didn't you feel it?

Seeker: I felt it once before.

Shri Mataji: Yes?

Seeker: I attended a lecture at Delhi University once, then I felt it a lot.

Shri Mataji: What happened since then?

Seeker: Sometimes it comes, sometimes it goes away.

Shri Mataji: So, you didn't pay attention – it takes time to meditate, right? Meditation is necessary, how will it happen without meditation? You have to meditate. It takes time to establish it. What happened, didn't feel it? It will come, it will come, everyone will come. Hmm. You felt it. They felt it. Get up, check your hands. Lift them. Felt it in the head.

Sahaja Yogi: A lot of warmth.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Sahaja Yogi: A lot of heat is coming out.

Shri Mataji: Let them go out. It's too hot for them. It's already hot. What about you? On Agnya (command)? Come – caught the wrong guru; gurus are sitting in every alley. What else will happen? Close your eyes. Did it happen or not? You didn't transcend?

Seeker: No, it didn't.

Shri Mataji: You didn't experience anything either?

Seeker: Nothing at all.

Shri Mataji: Let them experience it, come. Sit down, they will make you get realization. Now we'll have to import people from Australia. Turn your face towards me. They will explain to you. Now these people will come and tell you what Ganapati is. We have forgotten everything; we have become English, they are becoming Indian. Ascended? All the eleven, all the eleven.

Sahaja Yogi: There's also a program tomorrow evening at 6, C-49, Bhagwan Das Road. You can note down C-49.

Shri Mataji: In Delhi?

Sahaja Yogi: No, here.

Shri Mataji: Here?

Sahaja Yogi: In Jaipur, at C-49, Bhagwan Das Road.

Seeker: What time?

Sahaja Yogi: Six o'clock.

Seeker: Tonight?

Sahaja Yogi: Tomorrow evening.

Shri Mataji: Alright, what happened?

Sahaja Yogi: There's a problem due to the vishuddhi (throat) chakra.

Sahaja Yogi: In this program, you will be taught how to see the chakras and how their cleaning is done.

Shri Mataji: Did it ascend to the head?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: According to them, it did.

Seeker: I didn't notice anything.

Shri Mataji: It's the Vishuddhi chakra.

Shri Mataji: Warren. Go to Dr. Warren; he will correct your Vishuddhi. Their Vishuddhi.

Seeker: Should I go there?

Shri Mataji: Yes, they will fix it. Alright - let's see about others. How about you?

Seeker: Did you have any trouble with the prolapsed piles surgery?

Shri Mataji: Yes?

Seeker: I had prolapsed piles surgery last month.

Shri Mataji: Yes - since then, how has it been for you?

Seeker: I can't say. Does it make any difference?

Shri Mataji: Did you go to Delhi University?

Seeker: Yes, it was quite good; there were very good vibrations.

Shri Mataji: You sit down. Come here. You give to others - come, put your hand on their head. Come here. Place your hand like this. One hand towards me. Like this. Yes! Is it coming? Feeling the coolness? Yes, it's coming? You're feeling it, right?

Seeker: A lot of heat is coming out of the body, it feels like that.

Shri Mataji: That's it.

Seeker: A lot of heat is coming out.

Shri Mataji: There's a lot of heat inside them.

Left hand, right hand, place it on the liver. Place it on the liver - this hand towards me. Just let it go, come on. Now you understand - it's being felt. The thing is, after self realization, one should help others, otherwise the vibrations stop.

Seeker: What should we do then? I mean, should we work hard, give to people? When you light a lamp, you should place it under a table. If you don't support others, why would God give you vibrations?

Seeker: I don't understand others' perspective well.

Shri Mataji: You'll understand - now a center is opening here, right? Will you stay here?

Seeker: No, I'm going back to Delhi after a month. I'm here for a month.

Shri Mataji: Okay. Stay here, these people are here now. Now see? Yours? So they've transcended. Very well. Come, let me teach you. Come stand up. Teach them. (In Marathi) They'll explain. See, nowadays they've come. Yes, they've got realized - haven't they? Hm?

Sahaja Yogi: They're not feeling it - the Nabhi and Agnya.

Shri Mataji: (Marathi). Nabhi, Agnya - it's coming to the forehead. Say, "Mother, come into my head" - that's it. After the Agnya on the forehead. You? No. (Marathi) (Marathi) You come too - they'll explain to you how to lift it. Come. Yes, look at one. Yes, look at them, yes! You look at them, they're doing it. Come, Patankar - (Marathi) Hm, how are you? Quite a lot of heat is coming out - it's very hot.

Seeker: Does it have any special experience?

Shri Mataji: No, but there's a lot of heat inside you, right? Hold it like this. Right hand towards me. What work do you do? Hm?

Seeker: Office work.

Shri Mataji: What kind of work?

Seeker: Administration, accountant.

Shri Mataji: Accountant - hold the hand. What's their issue?

Sahaj Yogi: There's palpitation on the Void (Bhavsagar) for them.

Shri Mataji: On the Void. Who is the Guru? There must be someone. Have you been to someone's place? Have you ever been to someone's speech, never?

Seeker: We often attend speeches.

Shri Mataji: That's the point. Alright, now put the right hand on the Guru's chakra. And say, "I am my own Guru." Is it done? Let the hand move. Now give it to others.

Seeker: It didn't work for me.

Shri Mataji: No? It will work for you. How about you? No?

Sahaj Yogi: Those who have done it should step down and let others come.

Shri Mataji: Keep one hand on their head – one hand towards me. Lift the Kundalini from below – yes!

Sahaj Yogi: Those who are leaving, first take a photograph and they will tell you how to work with the photo.

Shri Mataji: Keep your eyes open. Keep your eyes open. Have you found it?

Sahaj Yogi: By placing a candle in front of the photo and placing your hand in the same way as you are doing now, you can feel vibrations, and tomorrow at 6 o'clock, it will be explained how to give vibrations in those chakras where you feel heat. It will be at C-49 Bhagwan Das Road.

Shri Mataji: There is a lot of heat, a lot of heat inside you. There are photographs and books here, you take them with you.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Seeker: I maintain a very disciplined lifestyle, such as a simple and restricted diet, and so on. My way of living is quite disciplined.

Shri Mataji: It's too much. You shouldn't play so much with your body like this.

Seeker: Yes, that might be true. I might have overdone it. I've been too strict with myself, which is why the right side is affected.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that might be true. But you never take any wrong steps.

Seeker: No, I never do, but I do tend to overdo it with myself and think too much.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that's true – there's too much thinking.

Seeker: Yes, now I realize.

Shri Mataji: It's started. What's happening to them now?

Seeker: They've got it, Mother, but they're slipping back again.

Shri Mataji: Tie him up. He has been to all kinds of gurus. Look at them – they both should be there – they will be through soon. Doctor, look at them. These people will be through in two minutes. They will also be through. It should happen. Now? Some coolness has started.

Seeker: A little.

Shri Mataji: Alright, you sit here. Sit for a while as we instructed. Your hand like this – slide it down there. You come here. It's not happening for you? What's the matter? Let's see. What do you do?

Seeker: I am an eye doctor.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Seeker: I am an eye doctor.

Shri Mataji: An eye doctor, an eye specialist.

Seeker: Initially, I was in Australia. I was in Melbourne for five years, then started (unclear) practice.

Shri Mataji: You came here from there now! Good! Yes. Warren, there is a doctor from Melbourne. Come forward, come forward. A lot of sweating is happening. What happened?

Seeker: Nothing.

Shri Mataji: What are they saying? Is it not happening? Did they let go? What are they saying? It will happen. Sit down. Relax. Sit down with ease, sit down without worries. Now, say?
