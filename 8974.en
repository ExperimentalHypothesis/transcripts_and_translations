I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

In these modern times, a new wave of consciousness is working. People are trying to seek, perhaps many of them do not know what to seek. The atmosphere is filled with this idea that there are a special category of human beings who are seekers. And with this demand, there’s a market now established to give you the truth. But we have to understand that you cannot find truth in the market. It cannot be found by your effort either. The truth is a living force. It’s a living force of the Living God. And you cannot find anything that is living through your efforts. That living force has to work through you, to manifest that truth within you.

So we have to be honest to ourselves and understand that no amount of theology or theories are going to achieve that state. We came from amoeba state to this state, and whatever we have achieved in our evolution, we have felt on our central nervous system. It is not that somebody tells you: "This is truth, and that is truth", you have to believe it. 

[To the interpreter: If somebody tells you "this is truth and that is truth"] 

Moreover, even if I say anything, you should not believe into, but keep a mind open. The thing is even they need not sort of blindly have faith in Me. I'm trying to say.

Because he’s got his Realization, he doesn’t know how to say this.

[Shri Mataji is laughing]

That’s a fact! But you have to, yourself, achieve it and feel it yourself.

As you can feel you are a human being, you have to feel the state of truth as well. And that is not difficult at all. That cannot be difficult because it is so vital.

Like, supposing we have to breathe, and for that, we have to go to some guru, or we have to go to some library, how many would exist? So I request you to have an open mind of a scientist. And if you find what I say is the truth, then you have to believe into it.

Now, what I am going to tell you is the knowledge of our roots. In the West, you have the knowledge of the tree [speaking to the interpreter: of the tree. ] You have to understand that as India has accepted the science of matter, you may also know the science of the roots.

Now, to know about the roots, one has to understand that you have to become a subtler being. To become the subtler being, what are we to do? What are we to do?

Now, when I say that already there’s a mechanism within us made ready for this purpose, you have to see for yourself if it works or not. I’m told that there have been many books about kundalini yoga, written by all kinds of people, frightening everyone that this Kundalini can do harm to anyone who tries to raise it. This is very surprising! Supposing I put my hand into the socket of electricity and I get a shock, what will you say? That means I have no knowledge of any kind, that I’m doing something extremely unauthorized.

For your information, this Kundalini is the energy of pure desire within you. All other desires are not pure. They’re represented by this- another blue line that you see here, which manifests in the human beings outside on the gross as left sympathetic nervous system.

Now, the other one that you see here is the yellow colour's power, which is the power of action. So, it asserts itself through our physical and mental being and manifest, within us, as right sympathetic nervous system. The central one which manifests, the parasympathetic nervous system, is the one which is responsible for evolving us. 

This parasympathetic nervous system is unknown to the doctors. This power, which is the Kundalini, is for the last breakthrough, the fourth Power, Gauri. This Power is going to give us the last breakthrough into the space of God’s kingdom. She is your individual mother. This is the Holy Ghost reflected within us.

If you ask a priest: "What is the Holy Ghost?" They say: "It's a mystery" because they have no knowledge of the roots. Actually, they did not allow Christ to survive.

Now, this Kundalini is lying in the triangular bone into three and a half coil. She is awakened just like a seed awakens itself in the Mother Earth. This seed is to be sprouted through a living force.

Shri Mataji to the translator: French is rather difficult.

French and English language, both fall short for the knowledge of the Self, I am sorry to say.
