Conversation with Sahaja Yogis, Residence of Madhukar Dhumal, Rahuri (India), January 8th, 1983

[Hindi]

All right? So, this is all a confusion in Gita. But whom to tell, you see? You cannot tell them. Because you see they- actually, it’s an attack on religion itself. In the beginning vegetarianism is an attack on religion.When Krishna had a cousin, whose name was Neminath. And he was one of the tirthankara (ford-maker) of the Jains. But these people used to eat meat. Meat was not regarded as violence or anything. And what happened, that, at this time, they attacked him through this Neminath because he was many chickens being killed, cattle being killed, and he felt that- mentally, he felt compassion, mental compassion for them. And he said, "We should have just ordinary food like carbohydrates". And then, he told them, "Better have carbohydrates, don’t eat any meat and things". So, all this mental compassion started from his cousin, that was the first one.

But as a result of that, they denounced Shri Krishna because Krishna has some ‘hare shakti’. And Krishna being a Kshatriya, he used to eat meat. So, they discarded him. So, according to them, Krishna was nothing but a 'Devyani' [unsure]. He was nothing higher. These tirthankaras were higher, you see. Actually, they are the same Shambhalastas people. Shambhala Gopi desert. [Shri Mataji is laughing]That type of people. All right. Whatever happened, they discarded Shri Krishna at that time.

At Rama’s time also, if you see, Rama used to eat meat. Because, you see, his wife wanted a blouse to be made out of the skin of a deer. I mean, it’s such a small petty thing. For that, he wanted to kill the deer. That means he used to kill the deer and eat it. And for making just a blouse, if he can accept such a situation, then he used to eat meat. I mean, this is the proof of the pudding.

And then after that, you see Krishna, Rama, [inaudible] and then Buddha also eat. The surprising thing is, in Buddha’s time, just to show this perhaps, Buddha went, at the end of his life, he went to see one hunter. And the hunter had a -what you call- a wild boar, a boar not cooked. And it was not fully cooked. So, the hunter told him, "That’s not fully cooked and I’ve, I mean it was delayed". He said, "It’s all right, I have to go now. Better give me". So, he ate that meat and that’s how he died, you see. So, it is written down that Buddha ate that wild boar and he died of that. So, this is a myth again saying that he was a vegetarian. He was not. His insight [unsure] meant being kind to your fellow men.It’s a very funny idea, diverting your attention from human beings to other things.

Of course, as we know, we have common sense. In Sahaja Yoga, we have to use common sense. And according to Sahaja Yoga, you see, we don’t believe, indulge, into all these melodramatic compassion businesses, you see.

So, in a proper way, what we do is to find out, first of all, what is the most important thing. The most important thing is to sustain human beings. Because they are the most important, they only can get Realization. So, they are the most important. Now, how to sustain them? Is to give them balanced food, propre food so that they are sustained and they are good for Sahaja Yoga.

We are not bothered about other animals. Of course, we don’t eat animals which are bigger than us because their fibres can eat us up [unsure]. But if he eats even smaller animals- actually, in the evolutionary process, we give them a higher life. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

If you put into a bigger animal, you will see, it will take the shape of the bigger animal. Muscular muscles or any muscles, if you put it into the bigger animal, the smaller one, you will see that the muscles of the smaller animal which you have introduced, will take the shape of the bigger animal.This is – supposing, a fish has to become a tortoise, all right? Now, it must have the muscles of the tortoise, isn’t it? Now from where to get the muscles of the tortoise? So, to create these muscles of the tortoise, you have to put these fishes into n animal which will make them higher. Once they are made higher animals, then these animals, once they die, they have greater muscular power which can be used and shared by lower animals. It’s common sense. It’s common sense, you see. So, we also make provisions for the lower animals. And the animals who are beyond us, we do not eat. Because it is common sense.We use common sense; we don’t use this melodramatic love for the bugs you see. [Laughter]But we have common sense. By this common sense, we stand in the centre and we try to understand how our body will be all right.

And so doing- for example, a person who just eats vegetarianism food, what does he get? All the troubles, you know, Left Nabhi, first of all. He can also get Left Swadishthana. But Left Nabhi is first. And what is the result of a Left Nabhi is? That such a person does not have a proper digestion. The power in the muscle, in any muscle, the muscles become very weak. So, such a person gets a muscle which cannot throw the food in a proper way. So, all the time, such a person gets diarrhoea. All the time. And then such a person all the time feels hungry and all the time gets diarrhoea. It’s a very weak constitution and such a person is very good, vulnerable person for 'bhoots'. Because it’s such a left-sided fellow. Now, such a person can have also a very slavish liver. So, he is very much susceptible to allergies.

For example, in Gujarat, people eat the same oil that we eat in Maharashtra, ’Shengana’. But in Gujarat, if you go, I tell you, at least, seventy precent people have lipoedema [?] in the vessels. That means that what people eat here, the- what you call, the fat of the groundnut, which does not have much of proteins, they become so susceptible that they catch this lipoedema [?] much faster than the people who eat meat in the Maharashtra. Because they cannot fight it. So, they are suffering from lipoedema [?]. And this Left Nabhi can develop with those people. Because, if you people have Left Nabhi, it is because it is an overactive Left Nabhi, while they have a slavish Left Nabhi.
