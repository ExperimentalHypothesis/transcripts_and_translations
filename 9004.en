Public Program Day 2 (Evening), Barcelona, Spain 20-05-1989

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

We have to know that so far we do not know the absolute truth. So when we have gone wrong is that we depend on our human awareness all the time and we believe that we are right. And when we start working on those lines sometimes we find we have done a big mistake then we retrieve back and try to find another way. In everyday life or in our own planning and understanding of life we have no way to say definitely that this is right and this is wrong.

The reason is we have not yet reached that point which we can say that actually is truth. In our evolution we have become human beings and the human awareness has brought you many more evolved things than animals. For example, if you have to go through a dirty lane you would not do it but a dog and horse can just walk through. There are so many proofs if you notice that we are definitely very much evolved in our awareness compared to any other living beings.

Now when we think of a philosophy o any ideology, about any faith, any religion, there also when we follow it what we find that we haven't got anything special about yourself. A Hindu, a Christian, a Muslim, a Sikh, any religion, can do any sinful thing. We cannot say that because we follow a particular religion we will never do wrong.

Then we see in political life where is, say we call it capitalism, we call it as other things, like communism and all that, there also - they are all just the same. So though they propound certain theories, they talk of certain things, nothing is inside them. For example many people talk of peace but there is no peace in their heart. They are running like mad. They have big organizations, conferences, all kinds of things. And what comes out of it? Nothing, the same human beings.

How is it that it is also artificial? Why is it it is not so innate, from within? The reason is we have to be one step forward now and have to know our Spirit. All religions have talked about eternal life and they've said that the transitory life is to be used in its own limitations and understanding.

But we don't find them, anybody following. Nobody is teaching the eternal. Then the question comes in: why follow any religion if we remain the same, high and dry? Or follow any system of life? It's better to be anarchists; there are some many people doing it nowadays. And they become very violent sometimes, very angry because they don't know what is the goal of their life. I don't blame the young people who are taking to drugs and all kinds of things because they think they have no meaning in their life. And when the transitory things also we do it so much we have to know that they are transitory because there is a built-in quality in them that they get destroyed. And when they start destroying themselves they destroy you also.

So this can't be. See now we've got atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb, ecological problem, this problem, that problem on our head. There is no balance in our adventures. The reason is that the light of the Spirit is not in our attention. When the light of the Spirit comes into our attention we know how far to go with anything. So now people have developing diseases which never existed before. Everyone wants to go to the extremes till they are finished.

Now I must say last time here lots of people came for Sahaja Yoga. So many also got Self-realization. But perhaps we do not realize the importance of Self-realization because very few came after that to develop themselves and to grow into this new awareness of collective consciousness. It is very sad that in Spain Sahaja Yoga does not settle down.

But danger is we are from all sides acted upon by so many negative forces. And as if we are waiting for the shock of our final destruction. And it is very important that you better know yourself and you develop your power as the Spirit. Because the Spirit is the collective being within you. And when it expresses itself then you'll be amazed that not only that you have the knowledge but such compassion, that you have compassion, such purity that whatever you we believe in is truth. You are completely integrated with that.

I don't know what fears there are. But what people have come to Sahaja Yoga have not only gained physically, not only mentally, not only financially but most of all spiritually. Perhaps in all other countries it is being taken very seriously. And one of the first countries I visited was Spain. And it is very difficult to understand why people do not have respect for their own being, for their own life, for the meaning of their life.

Now the days of fighting the bull are over. We have to fight the bull which is inside us. The bull that doesn't allow us to know the truth. And it is so simple; it's such a living process. And you don't have to pay for it. It is the living process and you don't ever pay for living processes. Like a tree sprouts by itself spontaneously - you don't pay to the Mother Earth or to the seed. You don't have to get in any austerity. I also don't tell you anything "don't do it". I don't say that otherwise half of you will go away. But once you get the light of your Spirit then you yourself start correcting yourself.

Like supposing I'm holding a snake in my hand and somebody tells me, "There is a snake in your hand." and I have no eyes to see and it's all darkness. No, I will be obstinate and say, "No, this is no snake, this is a rope." So either you allow that snake to bite or else you better open the light and the eyes of that person. So the best thing is, once your eyes are open by yourself you will throw away the snake; I don't have to tell you. And by arguments, by questioning, by all these webs of words are we going to get the truth?

Yesterday there was a lady, she couldnâ€™t get her Realization and she has read all the books that are possible in the world; and had all those books like a library in her head and she's blocked completely; she is nowhere. It will take time to take out the library of her, to make little space for her to exist.

So now after what Jose-Antonio has told you I don't want to prolong it anymore. They had a very good idea of having the program but I think the traffic, they are lost. So I would say that better have your Self-realization. Yesterday I've seen I worked till one o'clock with people who had this problem, that problem. And practically most of it was solved.

Only at the outset I have to tell you that you must love yourself and respect yourself because you are a human being. And in no way feel guilty. After all we are human beings and only human beings can make mistakes. God does not make mistakes but we are not God. So we should not feel guilty at all. And just before Realization you should really forgive yourself fully and be actually pleasantly placed towards yourself.

Now, I would of course like to answer your questions. But not like last time where there were at least sixty people asking question and when it came to follow-on I think three or four came up.

Question: Where does your knowledge come from?

Shri Mataji: Where was the knowledge coming for Christ? You don't worry about me. You just worry about yourself. I am not going to talk about myself. Christ said the absolute truth that he was the Son of God and that he was the Light but they crucified him. I have to do my job. I don't want to get crucified. So you first know yourself then you'll know me better. What's the use if I tell you something? Why should you believe me? It's a blind faith.

Question: Are there people who cannot get their Realization? What is the reason?

Shri Mataji: Oh, there are many. Some of them are very superficial; they don't care for themselves. They have no regard for themselves, nor they are seeking anything. They are the worst type. Then there are some who are sick; who have serious diseases. So they have to get their Realization and as a result they get cured also. There are some people who are very conditioned. They are also very difficult. But these categories can be brought out.

But there are some who are really obstinate; they don't want Self-realization. Like they say there are three lambs in a boat. So you ask, "How?" So they get hold of the backs and say, to now to you, "One, two and three." Then they'll get hold of another truth. You see, obstinate people, it doesn't work out.

Question: Can you give Realization to somebody who is not prepared?

Shri Mataji: No, that let me tell myself; you don't have to judge yourself. Most of you are prepared, I know. Otherwise you would have not been here. It's not a political, of a party, lecture.

Question: I doubt I will get Realization.

Shri Mataji: No, don't. You will, don't worry. Why not? Why not? Have a positive attitude.

Question: Do we have to do physical positions to get Realization?

Shri Mataji: No, no, nothing; very simple position that doesn't take much. We'll do it in 10 - 15 minutes.

There is one gentleman. Yes, come in.

Question: If somebody is seriously ill can it be dangerous for him?

Shri Mataji: No, not at all. You'll be better off. This is a hospital also. Without any medicine or doctors. Yesterday there was a case of polio and this lady got cured. It's a fact.

Alright? Any other questions? Don't be afraid.

Question: What is karma?

Shri Mataji: As always I think you people have read a lot about karmas and then you are worried about it. You know that Christ died for our sins. What does that mean? That if Christ is awakened within us he can suck in all our sins, means our karmas. So he is placed between the optic chiasm, like this. One of the windows is here and one of them - here [Shri Mataji points front and back Agnya]. And when the kundalini rises [she] passes through the Agnya - you see here these two institutions: one which is the ego - which thinks it has done karmas, and another is the superego which is your conditioning, both are sucked in by this awakening.

You see, when we say he died for our sins then why should we be obstinate? Then why should we suffer? He has suffered for us. Are you going to suffer more than him? So the whole idea of suffering for God is absolutely nonsensical. God is your father. He is a loving father, very loving, loving than any other father. How can he tolerate your suffering?

Thomas who was a disciple of Christ was going to Egypt. He wrote lots of speeches and put them in a big jar. And one English gentleman has now tried to decode the whole thing. And I've seen his [UNCLEAR] in which he has very clearly said that you don't have to suffer. You have to just experience Self-realization. Exactly this is what he has said. And he has also said that those who will get Self-realization will be called as Gnostic. Gnostic means who have the knowledge on their fingertips. So "gn" is a word, in Sanskrit language means "knowledge". But knowledge not of the books but on your central nervous system. It's the same as described as "Boddha", becoming Boddha: means to know on your central nervous system, is Boddha; from where the word "Buddha" has come, means a realized soul. And then we have another word "vid" from which Veda has come, meaning .... In the first words of the Vedas is that by reading all the Vedas if you do not get the experience on your central nervous system then it is useless to read these books, you get worse. 

So I think let us now have our Self-realization.

But you must promise that you will attend the follow-on and tomorrow you will bring your friends here so we give more people Self-realization.

The first thing you have to know is that you don't feel anything funny or nothing goes wrong with you, or nothing harmful happens to you, at all. Secondly, that we have to take out our shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. We have to sit very comfortably.

Those who want to go away should go away in time. Because when we are doing things - it takes only ten minutes - but you shouldn't disturb others, in all civility and all these things.

We have to put both the feet apart from each other. You have to put the left hand towards me because this indicates our desire to get Self-realization. And now the right hand has to be used for helping our subtle centers to open out.

Now somebody can come and show them that. Arno, will you please come to show it. Now he'll show you exactly how to put your hands, where and after that we close our eyes. He's come from Switzerland for your Realization. We have got people from France, from Switzerland, from England, Austria, Holland, Belgium, from all over they have come to help me and to look after you. Such a universal love and feeling.

So you put left hand towards me and right hand we use for putting first on the heart. Put it under your coat, would be better. In the heart resides your Spirit. Later on you have to put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen. We work on the left hand side only. Then we put our right hand in the lower portion of our abdomen, on the left hand side. The upper portion of the abdomen is the center for your mastery. But the center in the lower portion of your abdomen is for pure knowledge; knowledge which expresses itself on your central nervous system. Then again you have to raise your hand to the left hand side of your abdomen in the upper part. Raise the hand again to your heart. You can take out you glasses if you want. Put your hand across on your forehead and press it hard. Here you have to put it between the shoulder and the neck. This is the center where are catches when you feel guilty. A very dangerous thing that will give you spondylitis, that will give you angina and many other problems. At this time you have to turn your head to your right. Now you have to put your hand on your forehead across and press it on both the sides. This is the center of forgiveness, forgiving everyone.

At the very outset better start forgiving. Yesterday when they forgave then they got Realization. I spent so much time with them making them forgive.

Put the right hand at the backside of your head and push back your head. This is the center for asking forgiveness but without feeling guilty. Now stretch your hand and put the center of your palm on top of your head on the soft bone which you had in your childhood. Now press it hard, stretch the fingers and move it seven times, your scalp, in a clockwise manner. That's all you have to do.

Now please close your eyes. Till I tell you, please don't open your eyes because your attention is pulled inside. As a result you start feeling the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area like a real baptism, the actualization. Just feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head: you have to certify yourself. And also you start feeling on your fingertips and on your hands a cool breeze all around you. So this is the first time you'll be feeling the All-pervading power of God's love.

So now put the left hand towards me and right hand on your heart please. Here please ask me a question, you may call me "Shri Mataji" or "Mother". You can ask the question three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times please.

If you are the Spirit you become your guide, you become your own master. So put your right hand on the left hand side of your stomach and press it hard. And ask me a question; please ask, "Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times.

Now you have your own freedom. I cannot cross over it. I respect your freedom so in your own freedom you have to ask me. So you have to ask me, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." While pressing your hand in the lower part of the abdomen please ask me, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." Say that six times because this center has got six petals.

Now as you ask for pure knowledge the kundalini has started rising. So you have to open your higher centers. So please put your left hand towards me and both legs apart and now put your right in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Here with full confidence you have to help the kundalini by saying ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

Now the greatest truth about you is that you are the Spirit. You are not the body, you are not the mind, you are not the ego, you are your conditionings. But you are the Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and with full confidence again say twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit." Say it twelve times.

As I've told you that you don't have to feel guilty at all. The ocean Divine is the ocean of peace, bliss and joy. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and you cannot commit any mistake which this ocean cannot dissolve. So now raise your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and place your head to the right. Here now you say sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty." Say it with all confidence. If you still feel guilty you can say it 108 times to punish yourself.
