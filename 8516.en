I bow to all the seekers of truth.
It is so enamouring to see so many seekers in Vienna who have come to receive their realisation. Sahaja Yoga is not a new thing. In the tradition of spirituality it is mentioned about 14ooo years back by Markandeya. That ultimately it is the force within you of the Holy Ghost, which is called as Kundalini residing in the triangular-bone has to give the realisation.
But for that happening, human beings had to be prepared, people had to be balanced, and that is how many prophets came on this earth after that on the same tradition to prepare people, to have that balance, right from Abraham, Moses we see them following up to Raja Janaka, who was the father in law of Rama, and later on, we have so many others like Mohamedsahb, Nanakasahb, on this earth to tell us about having a balance in life.
they taught us moderation and not to go to extremes. You can see within ourselves we have two sides. One is the left another is the right side. But the human nature is that, that whatever one may try, they make extrem of everything. They can do it.
Like, when they talked about God, they went to the extreme of thinking, they were god themself, or they thought now God can be organised by human beings. Because of this extreme nature they
could never recognised the reality.
Reality lies in the central part, like those who are very futuristic people, who are planning all the time, who are running in the future, who always miss the point.
and those who are on the left side, who are lethargic also miss the point, because they stick to their past. Whatever they have achieved from the past, they think that is the right thing, that it is, what is the reality.
specially those are very much conditioned by the past cannot see the reality at all. So logically we reach a point where we understand, that if you become a futuristic person or if you deny, that there is nothing like reality, I have found out myself, than you miss the point.
and those who believe in their conditioning like now ‘I've got it, I have found it, I am that’, also away from reality. You have seen right from the beginning how Jews thought that they are the ones who are chosen by God, because Moses brought them out of the Maya of slavery. And then Moses himself saw the way Jews where going, so he said allright bring a very strong law how as you have seen in the chapter of Shariot where he says, you have to kill a person who does wrong.
these laws of shariot were taken over by the Muslims and the Jews do not regarded as something of their own use. Then it advanced further, when Christ came on to this earth. He also said in very simple straight forward words, that you are to be born again. Then Nikodemus asked him that: ‘Have I to enter into the womb of my mother?’ Christ said: ‘No, what ever is born of the flesh is the flesh, you are to be born of the Holy spirit, the Holy Spirit is going to give your second birth.’
so that whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit. But there also Christ completely failed to communicate I think, because nobody paid attention to this fact that you have to become the Spirit.
Now, how do you become the Spirit. Whatever we became in our evolution is felt on our entral nervous system. On our conscious mind. As human beings, we know what is the colour, we know what is dirty, filty, but animals do not know.
so if you are genuine seekers, if you are truthful about it, you must know that the experience of Spirit has to be on the central nervous system. So one thing we have to accept from these great people who came on this earth that we have something called the Spirit within us and we have to become that Spirit.
In an ordinary language we can understand that so far in our attention we do not have the Spirit. So this Spirit has to come into our attention. I don`t know about German language, but English is a very illusive language. Spirit of the Atma, Spirit of the heart, the reflection of God. Spirit is a dead
body or alcohol. But in Sanskrit language it is called as the Atma, is the Self, is the Being.
Now, when we say I: I say so, I say it with my Ego either I say it through my conditioning. So when we live through our mental projections, which is a limited instrument, we whatever we do is not absolute.
for example: One mister ‘I’ doesn`t think the way another mister ‘I’ thinks. But the spirit, which is the reflection of God Almighty within us in our heart is the collective being. That is the absolute, that is the light.
when that light comes within our attention, we start seeing, how we are related to each other. And we find out our wholesomeness. We find out we are part and parcel of one personality which is called as collective consciousness. But you actually become it is not just that now I am the part and
parcel of the whole but you really become on your central nervous system. When this Kundalini rises and pierces through your fontanal-bone-area you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.
Now what is this Holy Ghost. Nobody knows as far as the priests are concerned. To my amazement, I asked to a gentleman, who was a priest of a very great abode, ‘What is the Holy Ghost?’ He said: ‘I am agnostic! I said: ‘What are you doing? ‘He said, ‘I am doing my job!’
Now, what could be this holy Ghost? Let us see. Because if there is the God Almighty, the father and the son. How can you have a son without the mother? so there has to be a mother, and that mother is the Primordial Mother, which is reflected within us as the Shakti or you call it the Kundalini.
So this is the Holy Ghost as discribed in the Bible. To understand about Christ, also one has to go to other scriptures.
same about Mohammed, same about Moses. But all this religions surprisingly have become like small points stagnating. So one has to understand that when we talk of the Holy Trinitry it is the father, the mother and the son.
so this mother, this Holy Ghost is represented within us as the Kundalini. She resides within us as a living force, and is called as a residual energy, because the whole body is created, the mind is created, ego is created, but that has not yet manifested itself.
It has not manifested because when it manifests, then you get the effects of it. So the Kundalini is the power of pure desire, the desire of God is the Primordial Mother.
Now this pure desire within us has not yet manifested. If it had, we would have been satisfied people. But we are not satisfied because we haven`t found that which gives complete satisfaction.
so this power of our pure desire, resides in the Kundalini, in a sleeping state, till we come across someone, who has the capacity to awaken this Kundalini. Now it is very simple to understand, if you understand how we sprout a seed, which is a living process.
when you sew the seed into the mother earth, the mother earth has the capacity to sprout the seed. How much do you pay to the mother earth, how much do you exercise about it. It is all spontaneous it is Sahaj. So this spontanaety is the sign of life's force. Our evolution has to come, through that lifeforce of spontanaety.
But it is very difficult for many human beings, to accept that it should happen spontaneously. What is it, what is the matter, what is it? If you have somebody who is suffering from epilepsy it is better to take the child outside, because the force here is so much of Spirituality, that it reacts. The child will be cured, no doubt, but take the child out.
Now, when the Kundalini rises, she passes through this six centres within us, by which she enlightens these centers. And as a result of that we get our physical well-being.
Now for example, we have a boy who has epilepsy, is a possessed personality. And you know when Christ also address people the epileptic started shouting. So on the left-hand-side, when we have problems, of our mental problems like schizophrenia, epilepsy and this things, they also get completely cured. But this is not so important. It is just when we are going to have a vision of our Spirit when we are going to establish the purity of God, the whole temple of ourself gets cleaned up. So the temple gets automatically cleaned up and we feel that we are purified. The innocence gets awakened within us automatically. Now, Christ has said: ‘Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.’ But how many people there are you find who have not adulterous eyes?
These are the people who are innocent, those eyes are innocent, have to be something special. And they are the ones, about who Christ has said: ‘They are the ones these are twice born.’ The innocence is awakened. Then after the entry into this chakra which you see there, the Kundalini sucks in both your Ego and Superego. As a balloon you can see them there.
By that you become thoughtlessly aware, you go beyond thought. A thought rises and falls of and there is another thought that rises and falls off. But there is a space in between and you go and steady yourself in that space of thoughtless awareness.
But when the Kundalini pierces through, then you start feeling the all pervading power all around you. Like the cool breeze, you feel in the hand something going in from all around. And when you start growing up, then you start giving to others.
But you become again collectively conscious in the sense that you can feel your own centers now, you know which center is catching on your finger tips. Now I feel here all of you have one common problem, is the left Vishuddi - as we call it - this finger is catching.
Now what does that mean. That means that you people feel guilty for nothing at all. You condemn yourself for nothing at all, and you think you must suffer for getting to god. Now logically you understand that why should you suffer to go to God?
It was allright before Christ, but why after? Christ has suffered for us? are we going to suffer more than what he suffered? so why should we suffer? In the name of this suffering people go to the left side.
If a human being leads a moderate life, he never get deseases, he never has any trouble. But under the imaginary idea that you have to suffer and that you are guilty you go on moving towards the left! and what is on the left? It is the collective subconscious. It is all that is dead!
In Vienna or austria I think there are more dead than living. The whole left side is catching. Since my arrivel here I'm trying to clear out the left side of Vienna, and on the top of that you people feel guilty. You are moving in the wrong direction all together, see the seriousness of it.
the other day I saw a very good demonstration of the cancer research, doctors who showed on BBC, that when a person is vulnerable to cancer he is attacked by some entities, some proteins, which exist within ourself since our creation. They gave the name to those things as Protein 52 and Protein 58, just giving names. But they don`t explain it. So this area, they are discribing is nothing else than the collective subconscious. And this attack comes to you from that collective subconscious.
that means. If you try to go to the left, you are in for trouble. So we create our own problems! those who try to live with the left sided ideas of feeling unhappy all the time, frustrated, suffering - suffer!
Now those who feel guilty. On this side of the left Vishuddi which I am feeling too much - you all have caught up - you get the trouble of angina, or sort of a thing where the blood cannot rush up.
Now we have so much leasure in life that we sit down and try to create our own miseries. To understand real misery you must get out of affluent places and go and see for yourself what misery is. But those who realy face misery are happy people.
In the developing countries, I have not seen many people who feel guilty. Very few, they never feel guilty, they have no time. That`s why it is said, that cancer is a rich man disease. As a result of the Kundalini awakening you come in the center. Your attention from the left side is pulled in the center. Same thing like this boy today was attacked by the left side, will come to the center and he`ll be cured.
Now the right side people who are extremely aggressive type. Both are just the same. One agress other one agress himself.
those who are very much futuristic and of that kind get another type of trouble, of a very active heart and a very active liver. They suffer from overactivity and they go in a circle and they can`t stop it. So to compensate it then they take to alcoholism or all kinds of things which are left sided.
And the left sided people takes to voilence and all kinds of nonsensical things, just to balance. The whole world today is filled with voilence. We all talk of peace, but there is no peace within.
we have created atom bombs to kill each other, no animal has done such a thing. How can we get over the war situation unless and untill there is peace within us? But when you get collectively conscious, you know we are all part and parcel of one personality.
so if this finger is feeling sad, or I would say hurt, then another comes to help without obligation about it. It is a relief to yourself. Then the question comes who is the other. But only after realisation when you are connected to the mains, then only you start feeling that compassion that flows, otherwise, whatever compassion you try to express gives you an Ego.
But after realisation you become a personality which is hollow and the all pervading grace flows through you and you enjoy witnessing it. In that state you are completely in peace with yourself and peace with others. When a person gets his realisation for the first time you enjoy human beings as beautiful flowers.
after realisation only you have some meaning to your life, that you yourself realise, oh god, I don`t know, I`m such a glorious thing. Because once you become the light, you give the light. And the whole priority is changed in such a beautiful manner that you become absolute confident, fearless and loving personality. Your inner presence can cure people.
Your inner presence can do a thousand and one things, which you are amazed how it works out.
Many people asked me a question that why is it in India, which is such a Yoga country, people are not happy. I would saay relatively they are very happy people but materially they are not so good. But Krishna had said, when you will get your Yoga, you`ll get your well-being. But Indians after the 3oo years of slavery have become very westernised. Now they are trying to develop up the way of plastic influence. Say in this group how many Indians there are, none!
so those who are in charge of affairs have no wisdom of their own. They take their wisdom from the west. I think they will stick out everything from the mother earth, have big factories, then they will have tinned food, then they come to Sahaja Yoga. Become hippies and then they come to Sahaja Yoga. It`s a circle they have to go through.
But it can be short and in the village Sahaja Yoga is workinig out very well for your information, by which people are improving in every way even in material way. So now when you receive your realisation, the first thing that happened to you, that in your attention you become collective conscious.
Mohammed said: At the time of resurrection your hands will speak. He has written more about resurrection then doomsday. But Muslims don`t think about it. So you start feeling in your hand the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost and by this cool breeze, which is the energy of the integrated Divinity. You can cure anyone.
You can vibrate the water and the yield can be sometimes ten times. With this vibrations you can cure a mad person. Not only that but by giving the realisation to others anyone can give realisation to so many people. That you recieve the blessings of your own being.
and this new dimension makes you feel, that the whole world is one. All petty mindedness, all shortness, all useless nationalism, everything falls off. You become so powerfull, that all your habit falls off. You are like a Lord. Nobody can entice you. But the attention that you have work. It acts. If you pay attention to something it acts, it works. Like there was somebody, who said: ‘Mother, how can it act?’ O.k. Now, what do you want to know? I want to know about my
father who has not telephoned to me from Scotland.
I said allright: ‘Put your hands and just think of your father!’ And these are the centers of your father. And its starting getting a burning in this area. And I said: ‘That`s it, that means, he is down with very bad bronchitis.’ so he telephoned to his mother and he found out, that his father was down with very bad bronchitis.
Now, I said you pay attention to it. Just think of it. After one hour he said: ‘Miraculously, I`m cured!’ So the first meaning of Yoga means the union with the divine, which is fantastic itself. But the second one means the deepness, how to handle this all pervading power. It pulsates into everything. But you have to learn how to handle it. Which is called as pure knowledge Shuddavidya in Sanskrit.
and within a short time you become a master. It is very surprising I come to Vienna and in such short time there are so many people in Vienna who have got realisation. And within this short time there are so many masters, we have in Vienna.
an interviewer asked me: ‘Have you got all your children, Mother who are scholars?’ I said: ‘No! they are ordinary people. I said: ‘You become the knowledge!’ After realisation so you know everything, because you know the essence of everything and that`s how you can explain everything. As a result of that, you really become dynamic. Your problems are solved automatically, and you feel you are entered really into the Kingdom of God, where there is no taxation, no laws, no
regulation and you are looked after like a King.
But in the beginning every human being seems to be defident if not sceptical either this or that. They start thinking how can it be I`m such a bad person. I`ve done this, all guilty business starts coming up in the mind. But you must know that this creation has created you as the epitome of creation. And the creator himself is worried. If you don`t get your realisation then what about him. What`s going to happen to him.
He is much more anxious then you are, because the time has come. This is the blossom time. Then thousands of you have to get realisation. But you have to listen to me. With a scientific mind, that is an open mind, and not a closed mind. It is like a hypothesis for you allright. But it is proved, why not having if you have all this powers. All these propeties, all this glories within yourself. Why do you hasitate, I don`t want anything from you. You cannot give me anything accept, that you get your realisation. That is your birthright. But very difficult to convince people.
only the false Gurus can do it, because they mesmerise everyone. So finished. But you have to rise in your own freedom, in your own glory. So such a method is useless. So whatever has to be achieved has to be through your freedom and through your wisdom.
so I think for to days-introduction I`ve covered lots of subjects, and have tried to bring you to the center of this subject, that we have to have our realisation. So after this we`ll have the program of meditation, but those who want to leave, should leave! Just a minute please. Just a minute please. Those who want to leave, should leave first, because after that I will not like people being disturbed.
Please be civil and fair to others, if you want to leave, leave first. Please those who want to leave should leave first, because most of them, those who ask questions last time left, so I want them to leave first, then ask questions. We should not waste energy. No, No, It`s a waste of energie all
those who want to leave should leave, we`ll only allow people to stay here who would stay for about 15 minutes more in patience and not only people who ask questions and then leave.
We don`t want the time of others to be wasted for nothing at all.
there is some seat, get this people also to be seated, you have to be comfortable of you can come this way, that way, there is room, be comfortable. They can come this way. Some of the sahaja Yogis can give room to these people, who are standing all the time, you please see, that they are seated properly.
Now you can ask me questions. Last time those, who asked the questions for hours together and then they disturbed everybody and then they went away. Now, you please ask the questions, now if you have any, I'll be very happy to answer your questions now. See this is what happened last time, who ist there?
Question: In Christian tradition he has heard that the Holy Spirit is something which is grown from outside, so now you said is something which is inside, so how can you deny the truth?
shri Mataji: It`s a controversal thing Christian-tradition itself. Now it has come to a cracks so I am tell you about it. There is recently a book written by an English man I think who has challenged the miracles of Christ his immaculate conception and all this things and according to him, Paul never talked about it. Now I have to tell you the truth. I must tell you the truth. Now this gentleman Mr. Paul, when I saw him in the bible I was surprised, who`s this gentleman here.
He was himself a Jew who tortured Christians he saw that Stephens tortured then suddenly he gets a supraconscious, some sort of epileptic fit then he sees some light and he becomes an organiser of Christianity, who never met Christ. He was an intellectual, and he intellectualised Christ, and he established himself in the bible. How is he there?
what he did was to write letters of organising God and all the people. Because he wanted to go to he fought very much with Peter and there was no combination established. Because Peter was not an intellectual. So this Mr. Paul started a religion of his own. And surprisingly Khalil gibran has said
the same thing I am saying ‘Who is this strange man Mr. Paul?’ It would be like this epileptic boy talking of Sahaja Yoga.
and not only that Khalil Gibran also says, that Paul is a person who doesn`t know what he`s talking about that he`s not sure about himself. He says it in the book ‘The Son of Man’. Please read it, a complete chapter. So this Peter was completely made into nothing by Paul, then he incarnated on this earth as Augustine and started this so called tradition.
Now you`ll be surprised there is an archbishop of Durham who says that all these things are hallucinations of the disciples and there was no immaculate conception and there were no miracles of Christ; because intellectuals cannot understand these things. They bestoured a very great honour upon him in a church and the church get burnt. The church was burnt by a great fall of a lightning, absolutely burnt on top. So the archbishop says, it was God`s grace, that the walls didn`t burn. I tell you that not only Christ had an immaculate conception, but every miracles he did is a fact.
He is such the truth and you can establish it, when you come to sahaja Yoga. He is such a great truth and all these false people, who tried to malign him. To challenge Christ is a very dangerous thing. Because you must know he has eleven destroying powers, which are called in Sanskrit Ekadesha Rudra. He is the great incarnation of Mahavishnu. He is innocence personified. He has all the powers of innocence and who can challenge him. Unless and until one has realisation one can`t understand Christ.
so many people are shattered, their faith is shattered the way this intellectuals has taken over the tradition, so called tradition of Christianity.
But it is true, that the Holy Ghost can bless people and that the Kundalini rises when the Holy Ghost blesses the people, that Kundalini rises because of that, is a fact, but they don`t know how to explain, they don`t know what they are talking about. They did not even explain in any way, because they don`t know anything about it.
They don`t know, they have no knowledge about it. They did not even explain, that when the Holy Ghost blessed the disciples what language they were speaking and what they were doing, that people thought they are mad. Because the Holy ghost blessed them, they felt the cool breeze and started to talk the language of the centers as we talk. Not that somebody started speaking German, somebody started speaking Sanskrit, it is only possible for these things to happen when you get possessed.
But they got their realisation and they started to speak the Divine language of the centers. And when these powers are felt, then you start moving your hands in the deftness of it, you know how to use the hands, how to give balance, how to rise the Kundalini, the hands start moving. That`s why the people thought they were mad.
But I move in a society of another kind as you know, and in that I meet many ambassadors and great intellectuals and they all say, that these disciples of Christ were all stupid fools. Because they have not been to universities. What university did Christ go to? this is how there is a big rift now between the people who feel Christ is the embodyment of Divinity and those who are intellectuals of this kind who are challenging Christ.
But sahaja Yoga can prove that Christ resides on this center of agnya, there on that cross, because when the Kundalini stops at the Agnya point, you have to take the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, then the Kundalini rises. That is the gate here. So now as far as the tradition is concerned, I am rather doubtful how the tradition took every religion even Hinduism, like that. Islam is the same. Any religion you take the tradition is nothing but tradition of going down down down.
If it was a right tradition there would be no problem. Today we have so many churches, so many fighting, you see the Vatikan and the Mafia, Mafia in the banks, I can`t understand what Christ you gave him the thorn to be adorned on his crown. And what kind of crowns these people are wearing.
In India also we have also started another kind of competition. With your crowns. So somebody is making a big umbrella of gold, must say, crown is allright, they are wise but umbrella is dangerous. They are playing with Divinity, they have no sense that God almighty has a trmendous wrath for such people. The religion of Christianity or any religion is the religion of the living god. At different times there were great flowers on the tree of life, but we plucked them, and said this is mine, this mine and we are fighting for something dead.
But in Sahaja Yoga you will know the beauty of all these great prophets and you`ll be amazed how they have enriched us all of them.
So now I think one question was quiet needed lot of explanation and thank God I could say it in Vienna. Now let us have our realisation.
PART TWO: MEDITATION.
Now we`ll have tomorrow, alright you can bring the question I will definitely answer your question. Now this is only just to take help from Mother Earth. Though there is something plastic in between.Contact is on plastic, but it doesn`t matter. If you are sitting on the Mother Earth, it would have worked out much faster. But with shoes it's a little bit tight up so it is better to leave it.
there is no language for love, it is silence. Please put your hands like this. Now I make a humble request, that don`t feel guilty. At this moment forget the past. Don`t condemn yourself please. Forgive yourself and forgive everyone. Now at this time we have to just close our eyes and I`ll tell you how you yourself will be giving energies to your different centers yourself. And your Kundalini will rise spontaneously because with your energy you will open out the spaces of chakras. Now the left side represents your desire to get your realisation.
so you put your left hand constantly on your lap towards me like this. On your lap very relaxed, with the fingers opened out. Still the guilt is too much, please. Now with the right hand we have to do the action while it`s very simple. You have to first put your hand on the heart on the left hand side. All the centers on the left hand side are going to be nourrished. Place your hand on the heart and press it a little bit, not much. You can keep your eyes shut till I tell you to open because your eyes are open the Kundalini may not rise. Now, when you put the right hand on the heart, close your eyes, and you have to ask me a question. You can call me shri Mataji, or if it is difficult, Mother. Mother, am I the Spirit? ask this question three times without feeling guilty.
Now without feeling guilty you put your right hand on the upper part of your stomach on the left side. This is the center of the primordial master. Left towards me. Left hand towards me please, the other way round, yes it`s allright. Left hand towards me again. Now logically you have to say when you ask a question about the Spirit, you must know if you are the Spirit, you are your own master. So logically you ask the second question at that center. Mother am I my own Master? (3 times). (Somebody should see, also if somebody is not doing properly. Is allright!)
Now you have to put this hand in a lower region of the abdomen, where resides a center of your knowledge. The instrument to work out the divine resides there called the Swadisthana Chakra. So you have to ask me that you want that power, because I cannot force it upon you. When you put your hand there, six times, because there are six subplexuses to this center, you have to say’Mother, may I have the true knowledge?’ Mother, give me the true knowledge’ (6 times please do it). Now 6 times you ask for it.
Now raise your hand on your upper part of your abdomen now you have put it on the center of the Primordial Master. Now as you are asked for the knowledge, the first thing, you have to say at this center with full confidence in yourself, that: ‘Mother, I am my own Master!’ Keep your eyes shut please. Please say ten times. (Heart, may heart, And, then, better! why then heart?)
Now raise this right hand to your heart please. At this point now you have to again assert 12 times, because here are 12 subplexuses: ‘Mother, I am the spirit!’ Please 12 times. Open your heart - heart is very much catching - with full confidence, not to be frightened of it! You must have the desire, that`s very important, because it`s the power of desire.
Now you have to put this right hand on the base of your neck on your left hand side, from the front. Now this is a center which gets caught up, when you feel guilty. This is how you also gets spondalitis. At this center please say 16 times: ‘Mother, I am not guilty!’ And if you want to suffer and you have been doing all this guilty business, too much, say it 108 times to punish yourself. You have to be in a cheerful mood to enter into the kingdom of God.
You have to put your right hand across your forehead, please and hold it at this point. You have to say: ‘Mother, I forgive everyone.’ Many people think it is difficult but it is a myth. When you don`t forgive, what do you do. You just torture yourself. Just say that, and you`ll be amazed how your head will become lighter. Say it from your heart.
Now put your hand at the back of your head, you have to just say without feeling guilty, without feeling guilty, please: ‘That oh God, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me.’, because God is the ocean of love. He is the ocean of compassion. Above all he is the ocean of forgiveness. Now will you please not feel guilty, and I am telling you 1oo times, please don`t feel guilty. When you say that, by feeling guilty he is not going to forgive you. To feel guilty is not your idea, I can tell you because you are the Spirit. Spirit cannot be guilty. I only want, that you don`t feel guilty and your Kundalinis don`t stop at that point.
Now put your hand on top of your head on the fontanelle bone area with your palm, pressing against the scalp. At this point you have to again ask me for your selfrealisation. I cannot force on you. I have to respect your freedom. Now you have to say 7 times: ‘Mother, please I want realisation, please give me my realisation!’ Change now your hand please put right hand on your lap, left hand on your head. Keep your eyes shut.
Now just feel if you are getting the cool breeze on top of your head.
Change your hands and see about 4-5 inches high. Done! Change your hands again. Hm, better. Are you feeling good. Don`t think, watch me without thinking. Allright, You got it, Good. Now you put your hands up like this. ask the question: ‘Mother is this the power of the Holy Ghost?’ Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost, is this the all pervading power of God?
the colour of the hand changes, alright. See once you feel in your hands the cool breeze. Some are feeling on the left some are feeling on the right also. Those who are feeling in the left should put their right hand towards me and left hand like this (up to the sky). After some time you feel in the right hand also. Those who are feeling the breeze in the right hand, should put left hand towards me. The right hand on the stomach.
Better? feel it? watch me without thinking. Hamsa is catching. Tomorrow you must put some nasel drops and then come here, because you all have got some troubles. Now those who have felt over the head or in the hands, raise the hands, both the hands. great! I am so thankful. My greatest desire is that you have touched your realisation. Now you don`t think about it. Keep quiet. Tomorrow relax and come to the program and you have it completely fixed. It is like a very small plant.
You have to be gentle with it and carefully, say within a month, just establish yourself. You all become great trees, don`t discuss about it. enjoy the silence. Some haven`t got it, I know, doesn`t matter. Please come tomorrow and you all will have it. Now you've got the absolute and like a computer you can ask any question which is absolute. Ask a question. Was Christ born out of immaculate conception? ask this question in your head. You`ll get much more breeze. Alright.
Now you ask another question, did Christ walk on the water? ask a third question ‘Was Christ the son of God?’ You are without thoughts. Ask a question: ‘Is there God?’ Now the last question you should ask: ‘Am I part and parcel of the whole?’ Tremendous experience.
May God bless you!
