I hope you are enjoying the Indian music. Now I have asked them to sing a song which was written in the 12th century by a very famous poet called Namadeva. This is a folklore now sung in the villages of India for all these years where he has described the joy of Self-realization. So he says that “I have given up everything, my anger, my temper”, all these things which are my relations because he sings like a lady as if there’s my husband, my father in law, I have given up everyone. “But now o Mother Kundalini you be awakened, and give me” he asked “oh Mother give me the Yoga” means the union with the Divine. And that’s how in the village they sing and sing about getting realization and raising the Kundalini. And I hope you’ll clap to them and enjoy. [Mother talks in Hindi 6.04 – 6.15] Some of the Sahaja Yogis can come here, from Austria and other places to sing.. So this is the folklore and sung in a rustic way in the villages. Ambe, Ambe means the Kundalini and they are singing ude, ude means rise, rise. [Song – Mother starts talking again at 20.15] I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth cannot be conceptualised. It’s not a mental achievement because human mind has its own limitations and a breakthrough has to be achieved by which we become personalities above mental projections. When the mental projections we use they move in a linear directions and then they recoil because they cannot sustain themselves because the mental development or mental projection does not know how to keep the balance. For example now you can see the greenhouse effect as they call it in the west that is causing so much problems of ecology. And there are so many other problems as you can see with all the advanced countries all over. We have drugs we have aids all kinds of secret diseases all over. This is all due to our own mistakes. But the one who has created this beautiful universe must have thought of something better. How will he allow his creation to be destroyed like this? Now, I have to put before you the beautiful instrument we have within us which is going to give us union with that power which has created us. This instrument is within us and this instrument works out this connection and makes you like a divine computer. Now you’ll have to take an attitude of a scientist of an open mind and whatever I am saying, if it works, then you have to accept in your honesty. About this instrument many people have talked and said, even when we turn our attention to religions and to philosophies we find that all these theories are mental. Whatever we may follow, we can do any sin anywhere. Supposing you ́re Hindu, you ́re a Christian, you ́re a Muslim or any religion, you can do any sin belonging to any such philosophies. That means within us there is no power which controls our abandonment. Supposing we take to drugs there ́s no power that can bring us back from it. Supposing you take to immoral life there is no power that can bring you out, supposing there is a murderer he’ll go on murdering, what will stop him? There is nothing within us that empowers us to give us wisdom and balance. So when we see that the essence of all the religions is the same - that seek the eternal, and transitory is to be treated as it is in its own understanding and limitations. So where have we gone wrong that we not, we did not seek the eternal? Now if I say that there is a divine power which is a subtle power which surrounds us and it does everything, every living work. We see it every day for example look at these flowers. We cannot make these flowers. So many living things we see, flowers becoming fruits, a seed sprouting into a tree we just accept it, take it for granted. We do not want to think how it happens. Is there some power that does this work? Now the time has come for all of us to feel that power and to be in connection with it. And this instrument within us works it out. Here in the triangular bone, if you see, the bone is called as sacrum by the Greeks, meaning sacred, lies a power which we in India call as Kundalini. In the west we have been busy growing outward like a tree but if we do not know our roots this outward growth can be in imbalance and the day will come when the whole of this will be destroyed. So we have to have the knowledge of the roots. So this is the [PRIMULE] same of the seed within us which we call as Kundalini. In Sahaja Yoga practices if you come you can see the pulsation of this Kundalini and can hear with stethoscope very clearly. In most of the people I have seen – because there is such an urge to seek the truth – that Kundalini rises like a jet. But in some people where there is obstruction we see the movement is rather slow and you can feel it with the stethoscope the rising of the Kundalini even up to the fontanel bone area you can feel the throbbing like a heart throbbing. And suddenly you find it stops and that time you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head. So this is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. The power which is all around us is the power of the Holy Ghost and what you feel on your fingertips is the cool breeze that is the surrounding Divine Power. So in your human awareness you develop another higher dimension which is beyond your mental capacity and you become, actually it ́s a question of becoming not certifying that you are baptized or anything but actualisation that you become a realised soul. This is the last breakthrough we all have to achieve. In the evolutionary process we have come to the human level and unless and until we achieve this breakthrough there is no possibility of saving this universe because only after this breakthrough you can feel it that you have become part and parcel of the whole. It’s an experience. It’s a feeling within yourself on your fingertips. Jung has talked about it very clearly that you can feel your own centres and you can feel the centres of others. And all your physical, mental, emotional problems, even spiritual problems, you can solve them if you know what ́s wrong with you on what centre. What you need is only the decoding and understanding as how to solve this problem. In Sahaja Yoga now we have about thirty nations who are practising Sahaja Yoga and it is very gratifying to find that many people suffering from cancer and so many incurable diseases have been cured. They have come out of Aids and other addictions. They have become joyous, beautiful people. They have found out their peace within themselves. We talk of peace foundations but those who start the foundations don ́t have any peace within themselves. Maybe these peace foundations are preparing for next horrible war perhaps. But we have to establish the peace within ourselves which is all there. But this instrument has no meaning unless and until it is connected to the mains; we do have no meaning till we have connected to the mains. We do not know how great we are. We do not know what are our potentials. We do not know what beauty we have within ourselves. But once this connection is established you ́ll be amazed at yourself. And you will be surprised how, how you become so very dynamic as well as so very compassionate. There is such a lot can be said about Sahaja Yoga for I have must have given thousands of lectures which will be available to you later on. But as I have said it is all built in within us like all these lights are built in. You have to just switch on and then you can in that light in that enlightenment you can see for yourself. So no use arguing, discussing about it. First you get the light and see in that light. This is your right to get realisation. “Sahaja”, “saha” means with “ja” means born, born with you is the right of this yoga, means the union with the Divine. So I think we can just now have the experience of the Divine. If you have any questions is better you should write them down and send them over tomorrow, so in tomorrow ́s lecture I ́ll try to answer all your questions. It will take hardly ten minutes to get this experience of the Divine but it takes about a month at least to fix the connection, for some people. So you think we should have the experience first? Now those who do not want to have realization, you cannot force it. It has can be only given in your freedom. So those who do not want to have should please leave the hall will be very kind of them. Tomorrow I ́ll explain this instrument in a more clear manner. So to begin with we have to do some few simple things. Is to take out your shoes because the Mother earth helps us a lot for absorbing our problems. You have to put both your feet little away from each other because tomorrow I ́ll explain to you how we have got left and right, two powers within us of left and right sympathetic nervous system. And then I will also explain to you how the middle path of our ascent is created. It’s a very beautifully laid down instrument very delicately, beautifully made. So, one has to know that whatever you may think this instrument is quite intact. But there are two conditions we have to follow. One is that we have to forget the past. At this moment we have to forget the past completely. That means we have to know that we are not guilty, we have done nothing wrong. So you are not to feel guilty at all at this moment. Because feeling guilty is a myth; because after all you are human beings and if you have done mistakes, it ́s all right. You are not saints as yet. And the Divine Power of Love of God is so great that it has so much power of forgiveness that everything can be forgiven. The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone absolutely to forgive everyone. You may say it is difficult to forgive but logically it is a myth. Whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into your own mental games of torturing yourself and playing into the wrong hands. So at this time of resurrection we have to really know that we don’t have to think of anyone who might have harmed us. So, this is a very simple method, is that I would like you to also know the different centres which we are going to nourish for our ascent. So we put our left hand like this which represents our desire like this, (...call somebody to stand here, can you?) like this, like this, to represent your desire to get your realisation. Because this is the power of desire. Now this represents the power of action. So we have to use the right hand for nourishing our centres only on the left hand side. Now first I will show you how we have to touch our centres and then we’ll have to close our eyes. So please put your left hand towards me with the desire that you want your Self-realization. And first you are to put it on your heart, your right hand. Because in the heart resides the spirit. Then if you are the spirit you are also your own guide, your own master. So now you have to put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side. And then you have to put your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre of pure knowledge which manifests in your central nervous system. Then you have to raise your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen again. Then on your heart. Then you have to put your right hand in the corner of your neck and put your neck to your right. This centre gets blocked when you feel guilty. This is a very dangerous blockade because people get anginas and all kind of Spondylitis. Then you have to raise your hand to your forehead across you have to put it and slowly put down your head and press it on both the sides. Now, please take back your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head, slowly. Let it rest on your hand. Now, the centre in front was the centre of forgiveness and this is the centre on the back is the part of the same centre is for asking forgiveness. But here you don ́t have to feel guilty or don’t have to count your mistakes. Now stretch your hand and put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood, like this. Now, push back your fingers and press it hard. Here you have to do it carefully. You move your scalp with a pressure seven times, clockwise. That’s all we have to do. Now again I would like to request you that there is nothing to be very serious about it. It’s a spontaneous happening. You open your hearts and be pleasantly placed towards yourself. You have to enter into kingdom of God and you should be really very happy to do that. So now we close our eyes and you can take out your spectacles if you want and we don’t open them till I tell you. Keep both feet apart and the left hand towards me. Now close your eyes. Put your right hand on your heart. Here you ask me a question. You can call me Shri Mataji or you can call me Mother, whatever you like. So please ask three times “Mother am I the spirit?” Ask this fundamental question. Now, you have to know that if you are the spirit, you are your master. Because the spirit is the source of all the knowledge, joy and attention. I mean the divine attention. Now, take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to ask another question. “Mother am I my own master, am I my own guru?” Ask this question three times! Now, the centre of pure knowledge is to be nourished but I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it in your own freedom and glory. So please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. And here you have to say “Mataji, Shri Mataji, please give me my, please give me pure knowledge”. Say it six times because this centre has got six petals. As soon as you ask for your pure knowledge then the Kundalini starts moving. So we have to help her rise by nourishing the upper centres. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say with full confidence “Mother, I am my own master!” Please say it ten times, with full confidence. “Mother, I am my own master!” You have to know that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this intellect. You are not your emotions, your conditionings or your ego. But you are pure spirit. So raise your hand to your heart and say the most fundamental truth twelve times “Mother I am the spirit”. Now, I have told you that you have to forgive yourself because the Divine Power is the ocean of compassion and love. It is the ocean of joy and bliss. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and you cannot commit any mistake which cannot be dissolved by this ocean. So now please put your right hand on your forehead across and put your head slowly down. Press on both the sides. And here you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone” Say it from heart, from your heart. Please say it in the heart with full sincerity “Mother I forgive everyone”! Please sincerely say it! Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head And push back your head on it. Here, you have to say without feeling guilty “O Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me” but don’t count your mistakes. Say it from your heart. Now, stretch your hand, put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area on the soft bone. Push back your fingers. Here again I cannot force on you Self-realization. You have to ask for it. So please say seven times while moving your hand clockwise slowly with a pressure, seven times, please say “Mother please give me my Self-realization!” Press it hard, push back your fingers. Please take down your hands. Please open your eyes. Now put the right hand towards me and bend your head and put the left hand on above your head and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Some people get it very much higher, some get it closer but it should be above. Now, please put the left hand towards me and bend your head again and see with the right hand. Once again, you put your right hand towards me and please put your left hand to feel it. All of you please put your hands up like this and put your head up and ask me a question. “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost” or “Mother is this the all-pervading Power of God’s love” or “Mother is this the Parama Chaitanya”. Ask anyone of these questions three times in your heart. Three times; now, take down your hands. Watch me without thinking. Now those who have felt the cool breeze out of their head or in their hands please raise both their hands. Oh God, tremendous. May God bless you! Now most of you have felt it. Some of you have not. But there is nothing to feel bad about it. You will feel it. Tomorrow again, I hope you will all come and you will not think about it. Do not argue about it. Otherwise you will lose it a little bit. So just silently you go home and keep the silence, enjoy it and come back tomorrow. I assure you, all of you are going to fix it up tomorrow. Tell your friends, telephone to them, call them and this is the best thing you can give it to them. Thank you very much. May God bless you! Now, if you want to meet Me, I would like to shake hands with you all and I’ll be very happy to do that.
