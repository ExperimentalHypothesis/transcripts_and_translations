Evening Program Day 1, 05/11/1999

Talk start at 1:46:46

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, about fifteen years ago, some of us wanted to sek the blessing of having a puja in Delphi and I remember we had prepared the program but it was not then to be. It was to be now. This is the last puja in the occident, in the west, and it is the last puja in the west in this second millenium Shri Mataji, and it feels like long time back you opened a page in Delphi and now you are closing a page, opening a new chapter of world history. 

Of course, we are still completely baffled at your mystery and completely fascinated by your magic Shri Mataji. We do not understand anything, but we feel that this moment is completely historical. 

And in the Greek civilisation, there were two trains: one Apollonian towards the heavens and the light and the other one Dionysian, more earthly and much more ambiguous. But, basically, it was right side and left side and the whole Apollonian, the whole development of the right side, somehow, was initiated in Greece and we pray that now, both right side and left side will be brought  under the guidance of the Spirit Shri Mataji. Thank You for permitting Azol to welcome You her ein Delphi. 
Thank You Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: After such beautiful divine music, I don't know what to say. Even the heart of all the Deities must be jumping with joy as you all were jumping with joy. It's such an unisson, the oneness with all the musicians and the celestious musicians it was. It was really a tremendous experience of joy. I must thank the people who have come all the way from Benin, they did so well, I mean, I just don't know how rhythmically they always have been dancing. 
And in something in them, in the African people I've seen, they have such a lot of rhythm, all the time they are rhythmic: they'll walk rhythmically, they'll talk  rhythmically. It's sort of- I think sometimes - Shri Shiva is acting throught them. All the time this rhythm is so beautifully done and the way they change it, make it patterns, and double it, triple it, and suddenly new patterns come out. 
[Aside] Now what is the other country, this one I don't know. Other country? 
Sahaja Yogini:  Ivory Cost
Shri Mataji: Then comes Ivory Cost. And the people from  Ivory Cost are also very remarkable. I was surprised the way the ladies also were dancing absolutly full of, full of rhythm. I mean all of you should learn rhythm from them. That is something so important to understand and to enjoy music and to enjoy Sahaj. 
You see, it's like - I see so many lights there as if I felt you all got the lights in yout throat, in your eyes, also in your Sahasrara. 
It was a wonderful time so we must thank them especially these two people who have come all the way to entertain us and to make us enjoy everything. So we have to be very thanksful. And how, see so much far away they are otherwise, but how they have become so much one with us.  
We must thank the French for this that they went and governed those countries. By their governing them, they came close to us! If they had not governed them, there would have been no possibility of meeting them so soon. 
So it's such a beautiful combination, oneness with all of us and I must thank you again and again.

Then we have another little thing which is very important at least to do. I've seen now such a genius, there is one genius born and he must be a great musician in his last life I'm sure! The way he angles the violin, I can't believe it. 
But [unsure] he can play without notations, without something, is a miracle. And if that has happened because of Sahaja Yoga, I must say Sahaja Yoga itself is a miracle. And then he took to Indian classical music, he was playing very deftly, absolutely so well, I was amazed how a talented person like him can take to any kind of music. 
And Babamama has already told Me that: "Your Sahaja Yogis are very talented. They are very talented people. Otherwise, how could they take to this difficult, classical, Indian music? Not only they have taken it but they have mastered it." 

Now, we had on tabla another French man whom I had not seen for the last tree, four years, but I think now he has mastered it. The way he plays is really very remarkable. I was surprised how he could play. And then is this gentleman who played " [raag] Malkans" to you. It's a very difficult raag. In that one swara, we call them "madewa" that is being taken away from the main team [range] and also the- I don't know English word â€“ the "pa" [sol] is also removed. It's a very difficult, very melodious and not easily learnt this Malkans raag. I'm surprised how these people in such a short time have mastered such a difficult raaga for which in India, Indians, have to work years together. But you're being even not Indian, you have never heard these notes and how you have achieved this mastery is beyong Me. It's a real, I must say, the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga is that it has given you rhythm, it has given you swarasasana, means the notes.
