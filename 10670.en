Evening Program Day 1, Delphi, Camping Apollon, 05/11/1999

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, about fifteen years ago, some of us wanted to seek the blessing of having a puja in Delphi and I remember we had prepared the program but it was not then to be. It was to be now. This is the last puja in the occident, in the west, and it is the last puja in the west in this second millennium Shri Mataji, and it feels like long time back you opened a page in Delphi and now you are closing a page, opening a new chapter of world history.

Of course, we are still completely baffled at your mystery and completely fascinated by your magic Shri Mataji. We do not understand anything, but we feel that this moment is completely historical.

And in the Greek civilisation, there were two trains: one Apollonian towards the heavens and the light and the other one Dionysian, more earthly and much more ambiguous. But, basically, it was right side and left side and the whole Apollonian, the whole development of the right side, somehow, was initiated in Greece and we pray that now, both right side and left side will be brought under the guidance of the Spirit Shri Mataji. Thank You for permitting us all to welcome You here in Delphi.

Thank You Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: After such beautiful divine music, I don't know what to say. The, even the heart of all the Deities must be jumping with joy as you all were jumping with joy. It's such a unison, the oneness with all the musicians and the celestial musicians it was. It was really a tremendous experience of joy. I must thank the people who have come all the way from Benin, they did so well, I mean, I just don't know how rhythmically they always have been dancing.

And in something in them, in the African people I've seen, they have such a lot of rhythm, all the time they are rhythmic: they'll walk rhythmically, they'll talk rhythmically. It's sort of- I think sometimes - Shri Shiva is acting through them. All the time this rhythm is so beautifully done and the way they change it, make it patterns, and double it, triple it, and suddenly new patterns come out.

[Aside] Now what is the other country, this one I don't know. Other country?

Sahaja Yogini: Ivory Coast

Shri Mataji: Then comes Ivory Cost. And the people of Ivory Coast are also very remarkable. I was surprised the way the ladies also were dancing absolutely full of, full of rhythm. I mean all of you should learn rhythm from them. That is something so important to understand and to enjoy music and to enjoy Sahaj.

You see, it's like - I see so many lights there as if I felt you all got the lights in your throat, in your eyes, also in your Sahasrara.

It was a wonderful time so we must thank them especially these two people who have come all the way to entertain us and to make us enjoy everything. So we have to be very thankful. And how, see so much far away they are otherwise, but how they have become so much one with us.

We must thank the French for this that they went and governed those countries. By their governing them, they came close to us! If they had not governed them, there would have been no possibility of meeting them so soon.

So it's such a beautiful combination, oneness with all of us and I must thank you again and again.

Then we have another little thing which is very important at least to do. I've seen now such a genius, there is one genius born and he must be a great musician in his last life I'm sure! The way he handles the violin, I can't believe it.

But [unsure] he can play without notations or without something, is a miracle. And if that has happened because of Sahaja Yoga, I must say Sahaja Yoga itself is a miracle. And then he took to Indian classical music, he was playing very deftly, absolutely so well, I was amazed how a talented person like him can take to any kind of music.

And Babamama has already told Me that: "Your Sahaja Yogis are really talented. They are very talented people. Otherwise, how could they take to this difficult, classical, Indian music? Not only they have taken it but they have mastered it."

Now, we had on tabla another French man whom I had not seen for the last - I think- three, four years, but I think now he has mastered it. The way he plays is really very remarkable. I was surprised how he could play. And then is this gentleman who played " [raag] Malkans" to you. It's a very difficult raga.

In that one swara, we call them "madewa", that is being taken away from the main team [range] and also the- I don't know English word – the "pa" [sol] is also removed. It's a very difficult, very melodious and not easily learnt his Malkans raag. I'm surprised how these people in such a short time have mastered such a difficult raga for which in India, Indians, have to work years together!

But you, being even not Indian, you have never heard these notes and how you have achieved this mastery is beyond Me. It's a real, I must say, the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga is that it has given you rhythm, it has given you “swarasasana”, means the notes. You are not weaving out from the notes.

I’m not myself, I myself don’t sing myself, I used to once upon a time, but my family is so much in music that it has gone into my heart, into my mind. And when I see this, I say: "Look at that! How these people have come out!"

The last but not the least is this lady, Ana,

Sahaja Yogini: Anne.

Shri Mataji: Who is another master. Well, they're all masters can you imagine? This little boy is already a master. But the ways he's accompanying Indian music, I mean, I'm amazed at him. In the same way, this lady the way she was rendering very difficult ragas, with such deftness with such perfection. I mean, I'm going to now take this film to India.

They have been asking Me: "Mother why don't you give your episodes, your programs to us. We'd like to broadcast it from the Television."

Now I'll say: "Look at this, you see this. And they will all jump at it I tell you. They will have it and they will do it. And they'll be so amazed that how could, with Sahaja Yoga, you could master these things.

And see the oneness of us. You are from this country you are from that country, and also speak different languages and you understand different words, everything differently. But when it comes to Sahaja bhajans, I don't know how you get completely one with it. That shows that Sahaja Yoga is going to bring the whole world together through its music and through its manifestation.

I am really very much honoured, I am thankful to all the artists, all of you for such beautiful rendering.

For all the ladies who have come here, I wish I was young to learn their dancing. But I'm not.

[Laughter; applause]

Also, I used to sing very well but because of lecturing and all that I think I've lost that capacity to sing.

Now you see, after you see this, it's like a reflection of your heart, it's the reflection of your ideas about your ideal, your visions. You see this world singing together the song of Divinity. It's something nobody will believe that we have such a good group of people here.

I'm thankful to you all and to the audience who have joined and have shown their beautiful oneness and also the expression of their joy.

May God bless you all.
