Puja in Pune, Maharashtra (India). 26 February 1979.

[Marathi to English part]

Today on the occasion of Mahashivratri I am going to tell you the importance of Shiva .

You have to understand it. Even though Shri Bramhadeva created this creation and in that creation [UNCLEAR] and evolution we got human birth and this human form is given to us by the power of Vishnu Even so, this human being has to attain the principle of Shiva Finally Vishnu also has to worship Shri Shiva hence is the importance of Shiva. Shiva Tattva (Principle) is our spirit. all this effort, all this evolution is for knowing that principle which is Shiva Tattva, Shiva Tattva is the Primodial Tattva, it is the principle of Sada Shiva, it is Eternal, and from that all the other principles came out and human beings were created. Now human beings should know that Shiva who wished to make this creation and create humans beings in it and those human beings should know God, Have his power and should be engrossed in the joy of that power and in his work and he also wanted human beings to experience it This has happened through Sahaja yoga. Even if you received your Realisation through Vishnu Tattva, what you obtain is Shiv Tattwa. This Shiva principle flows from the hand and we feel it as a Chaitanya Lahari(vibrations), this is the yoga you have attained Shiva has put his power, that is Shiva Shakti, we call it Mahakali Shakti, only a small part is put in every human being as kundalini which pierces the six chakras and ultimately unites with Shiva. This is the principle of Shiva. Shiva means the ocean of compassion, ocean of mercy, Treasure of love. This is all the principle of love.

To know Shiva is to know the truth and he is the ocean of joy. Joy flows from him It is very easy to please Shiva. He is very naïve. He is a love hungry lord. (so) it is a very easy job .He never looks up, always looks down,He doesn't see other useless things, so he sees only the devotees who are worshipping him at his feet [unclear] He is so much naive that even the demons also pleased Shiva.They were ready to serve him They did not want to displease Shiva whatever happens. With this cleverness they have pleased Shiva (no voice ) ........If they have overcome or awakened their Shiva principle a little too much and have pleased Shiva, they are doing whatever they like,thinking that no matter what they do, their existence cannot be destroyed easily. Today you should seek that Shiva Tattva in your prayer that now open the eyes, open the third eye and see with those eyes all the demons should be destroyed The devotees have suffered a lot , they have been troubled a lot and now the devotees have come to that state where only they have authority over Shiva If you do such a prayer to Shiva today is a great day, then that Shiva Tattva will give you a great blessing and that blessing will be for the well being of the whole world We have all the right, all the desires to take his blessing, so we should take his blessing today similarly, we should take the blessings today for our own Shiva tattva also. The Shiva principle is the principle of the spirit itself which is detached,tranquil and saintly. When one's attention is on his spirit , then he progresses very well One should always worship the spirit within, the self, the inner spirit, Attention should be on the spirit so that we get detached from what is happening outside Everything outside is all an illusion. Bramha Tattva is the thrill of Shiva's body So our aim should be just to please Shiva and we do not want anything else That's what we want to experience, that's what we want to enjoy, that's how we want to look at the world.

so we should see the outside world through the eyes of the spirit. we should pray to God for ourselves in this manner. That means, slowly, after getting rid of the external worries, you will become one with the principles, you will live in the principles. The principle is not attached to anything,it is detached and disinterested and then there is only joy everywhere.There is no limit to that joy. For that, we should not show anything outside that we have discarded this and that, it goes away from within and our attention is completely absorbed in that Shiva Tattva.. I bless you that all of you attain that state today. Today you should do this Shiva puja very humbly and get the most important thing for which all this Sahaja Yoga is built and I hope you all will get it. It must first be holy The second thing after sanctification is our Kundalini. Kundalini as just now I said that Sadashiva has installed his Shakti which is Kundalini. It is Mahakali's Shakti.

All the other Shaktis come out the Mahakali Shakti and some fraction of it, is the Kundalini Shakti.. And it is sitting in the triangular bone. But she is Gauri Swaroop which means she is still chaste. she is still married but she is still a virgin waiting for a husband so this is Kundalini And that Kundalini has created Ganesha, as the sacred protector. Now we have appealed to Gauri i.e. Virgin girl . And after that, which way should she go now, it is Mahalakshmi's way, She has to go through Shushumana path. And through Shushumana paths she met Shri SadaShiva at the Feet of Sadashiva meaning that the Divine Shiva Tattva, which resides in the heart, was satisfied. It gets satisfies. It shines and becomes enlightened Its only then that our yoga happens. So, first of all, before reaching Shiva, we should understand his path.

So now Mahalakshmi should be invoked. After the invocation of Mahalakshmi, then we will come into the state of Shiva. And this is by Kundalini, and Kundalini is Shiva Shakti. This is the power of Shiva, that is, it is the power of Mahakali and it is sitting in our triangular bone But then, Shiva Shakti, mounts on Mahalakshmi path and rises and gets one with Shiva. It happens like this. It means always Lakshmi should worship Parvati or Shiva has always given boon and Vishnu has always worshipped Him. Thus we have to understand that Shiv tattwa is the highest.

... and innocence on this earth. Then we worship Gauri, that is the Kundalini, because through Kundalini only we get to our ascent. Kundalini is the power, residual power, of the Mahakali. And She is settled in the triangular bone, as you know, and is worshipped as a “Kanya”, because though She is married, yet She’s a Virgin, so She’s worshipped there. After that, the Kundalini has to rise through the central path of Sushumna which is guarded and nurtured by Mahalakshmi, so we have to worship Mahalakshmi’s force, that’s how we worship Her. Through the Mahalakshmi we prepare the path for Kundalini to cross over; when the Kundalini crosses the Mahalakshmi path, it comes up to the Sahasrara and breaks the Brahmarandra, becoming One with the All Pervading Power of Shiva Tattva, because Sadashiva is on our fontanelle bone - is, His Legs are resting on our fontanelle bone area. When the Kundalini touches His feet, then the Shiva Tattva in our heart, which is the Spirit, is enlightened and we get the enlightenment. This is the yoga which we achieve through our Sahaja system - and that is why we have now worshipped the Mahalakshmi. After that, now we have to in... we have to invite, avahana as they call it, inovation; invite the deity of Shiva and Parvati, and then we have to put our hearts to pour its love, which is called as “abhisheka”, through the symbol of water. The... the water container is like a heart which pours the water all the time on the Feet, showing that it is our heart which is pouring our love on Shiva, by which we win Him over and call Him, invite Him. And after that, we will give Him what He likes the most, is the Bel Patra, which is a leaf which has got three leaves on one stem, which means His three powers, Trigunatmika, three powers. So with our three powers, ours trigunas, our three powers, we surrender ourselves to Shiva and by that we show that we give our trigunas to You, so that we becom e gunateet. This is what is the Shiva puja.

May God bless you!
