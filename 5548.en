[English part (10:17 - 13:30) ]

... and innocence on this earth. Then we worship Gauri, that is the Kundalini, because through Kundalini only we get to our ascent. Kundalini is the power, residual power, of the Mahakali. And She is settled in the triangular bone, as you know, and is worshipped as a “Kanya”, because though She is married, yet She’s a Virgin, so She’s worshipped there. After that, the Kundalini has to rise through the central path of Sushumna which is guarded and nurtured by Mahalakshmi, so we have to worship Mahalakshmi’s force, that’s how we worship Her. Through the Mahalakshmi we prepare the path for Kundalini to cross over; when the Kundalini crosses the Mahalakshmi path, it comes up to the Sahasrara and breaks the Brahmarandra, becoming One with the All Pervading Power of Shiva Tattva, because Sadashiva is on our fontanelle bone - is, His Legs are resting on our fontanelle bone area. When the Kundalini touches His feet, then the Shiva Tattva in our heart, which is the Spirit, is enlightened and we get the enlightenment. This is the yoga which we achieve through our Sahaja system - and that is why we have now worshipped the Mahalakshmi. After that, now we have to in... we have to invite, avahana as they call it, inovation; invite the deity of Shiva and Parvati, and then we have to put our hearts to pour its love, which is called as “abhisheka”, through the symbol of water. The... the water container is like a heart which pours the water all the time on the Feet, showing that it is our heart which is pouring our love on Shiva, by which we win Him over and call Him, invite Him. And after that, we will give Him what He likes the most, is the Bel Patra, which is a leaf which has got three leaves on one stem, which means His three powers, Trigunatmika, three powers. So with our three powers, ours trigunas, our three powers, we surrender ourselves to Shiva and by that we show that we give our trigunas to You, so that we becom e gunateet. This is what is the Shiva puja.

May God bless you!
