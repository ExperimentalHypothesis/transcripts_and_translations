As sometimes, we, in our memory, relive some beautiful moments of our past and feel the same joy, in the same manner, every idea of a realized soul can be materialized (sakar).  We do it unconsciously many a times when we paint an unknown picture.  We imagine and enjoy our imagination and then recreate and enjoy more.  But a sahaja yogi can weave a beautiful pattern of joy by suggesting joyful, beautiful ideas to oneself.
