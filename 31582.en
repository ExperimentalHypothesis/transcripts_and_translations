Shri Mataji: So, is there any other problem with people? 

[Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Are you all right?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. 

Alexandre: He says has still a pain in the sternum.

Maire: A little bit. 

Shri Mataji: Hold your breath. 

And ask in your heart and hold your breath, ask in your heart: “Are you the Mother of the world?” Thrice. Then expire. 

Thrice.

It is coming. [Laughter] 

[Inaudible] So much vibrations, just feel the vibrations. 

[Laughter]

So, I talk and vibrate. Here I talk and I get the vibrations. [Shri Mataji put the mic above her left ear, on her head.]

So, vibrations will be better. 

[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: It’s a new model, 

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s a modern one. 

Shri Mataji: Modern. 

[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: I tried to have two microphones.

Shri Mataji: How you are now, better? How is he? 

Are you married, mister?

Alexandre: This one? He is still a student. 

Sahaja Yogi: Not this one, Didier. 

Alexandre: Didier? No, he is not married.

Didier: No, I don’t want to.

Alexandre: He is working in France. [Inaudible]. He is a plumber. All the commodities that you have in the ashram it’s by his work.

Shri Mataji: London is looking for plumbers. With the Golden builders there is only one plumber. 

You can earn a lot of money there also. [Inaudible].

Shri Mataji: How many people are unemployed? 

Sahaja Yogi: Now, two million are. 

Shri Mataji: But in England it is [inaudible].

Do they get dole here? 

Alexandre: Yes.

Shri Mataji: What is your idea of marriage? Do you want to marry and what nationality? 

Daniel: Any woman. 

Italy, Australia. And India.

Shri Mataji: In India now, we have been exhausting the number of women. [Unsure].

[Laughter]

Alexandre: Next generation. 

Shri Mataji: Maybe one or two. 

[Laughter]

What about you? Would you like to marry an Indian? 

Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know. I don’t think I can decide to which one because I don’t know what is the nationality of the Spirit, Mother. [Unsure].

Shri Mataji: Nationality of the Spirit? [Inaudible]. 

Sahaja Yogi: It’s English. 

Shri Mataji: Nationality of the Spirit. English are not sure. 

[Laughter]

[Inaudible].

But I must say it was a very, very great success in Paris, very great success. Lots of [inaudible] I was very surprised, I didn’t expect [inaudible].

Last Sahasrara Day, we had it in Bombay on an island, on the seashore, all wild and desert island [Gorai Creek]. And I saw the trees there, coconut trees. And a coconut is called as “shripala” is the fruit of the Devi. And a coconut represents- represents- the Sahasrara. Like we have the scalp, and we’ve got the black, the white – what you call- the grey matter, the white matter and inside this thing, it’s the Sahasrara, is the limbic area inside that is the spinal fluid. 

So, [inaudible] the trees and there’s a tremendous breeze, brought by the sea, that turns them towards the land. But they bend down towards the sea because the sea is their guru. So, these coconuts trees that despite the fact that they have to spread things, the coconuts, all over the place, they still bend down towards the sea. 

It’s something remarkable [inaudible] because such a pain, all trees can bend towards the land. All of them bend towards the sea. And what they do is to suck in that salty water, you can say, and make it a sweet water. [Unsure]. 

And it’s what you have to do is to take all this salty water from the Bhavasagara and make it sweet. 

This time again we saw beautiful Sahasrara patterns in the chapel.

Alexandre: In the sky, Mother? 

Shri Mataji: No, no, in the chapel- of different chakras. So, this is how for ten years, something very well established in the Sahasrara Day, it works out automatically. Nature, everything works for you. They asked Me that the weather should be all right. I said: “You don’t worry. You’ll get a perfect weather. All the flowers bloom out [inaudible] just play your part of the game”. And you must play the tapes simply, and while listening to it, try to understand and find out the questions and write them down. And also, later on, you see, you’ll get the tapes of Easter from England [inaudible]. 

Easter, I used to talk very well about the Resurrection part and how we have to manifest it. And I said: “I will not take a sari on Easter day.” So, they collected some money and they said: “[Inaudible] what to do with it?” I said: “You should buy something for yourselves.” So, they had given Me some eggs done by the Sahaja Yogis themselves, all kinds of designs. And in the market, I went and there I saw a beautiful basket of- just like a bandhan- of glass, inside were all stuffed birds. Just like a bandhan. And there were birds. So, I told them now the eggs have become birds. 

So now, you have become birds. That’s it.

Is the plane announced? Not yet, we are quite in time here. 

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Five, ten minutes more. 

Shri Mataji: Now, after Sahasrara the birds have to fly, fly to all the directions, enjoying all the beautiful areas of pragnya loka. And also gather other birds or their eggs.
 Alexandre: What is of pragnya loka, Mother?
 Shri Mataji: Pragnya loka is the loka [region] is the one- vibrations when you feel, it’s enlightened [unsure]; “gnya” is the knowledge, “pra” means enlightened knowledge. So, in that loka now you don’t need [inaudible] you can feel it. “Pra” is enlightened, “gnya” is consciousness. The enlightened consciousness in that pragnya loka, you have to spread.
 You asked Me many questions, I’ll tell any left-out one.
 Sahaja Yogi: Between cold liver and hot liver, what are we suffering from? And how to relieve, if I’m cured, what should be forgotten? 
 Shri Mataji: No, hot liver suffers from biliousness, you feel like vomiting, you don’t get hungry, you don’t feel like eating food. You faint down. You feel angry, hot temper, and you are always very particular. You vomit out and in the morning you feel dizzy. 
 Sahaja Yogis: Cold liver. 
 Shri Mataji: Cold liver is the one where you develop allergies, left-side. You develop allergies on the body, allergies. 
 She has hot liver. 
 Alexandre: So, what is the diet for hot and what is the diet for cold liver? 
 Shri Mataji: For hot liver, you should take as medicine what we call [inaudible], I’ll try to send it. Another thing [inaudible] sugar, all cheese, especially these French cheeses that you eat. And no fats. 
 For cold liver, you see, you have to take calcium for allergies. 
 But now, after certain [inaudible] there is something that Indians call “neem” [neem pa ta ka] I don’t know if you can get it here, [inaudible] It can cure. 
 [Inaudible conversation]
 Shri Mataji: “Neem”. 
 Alexandre: It’s for cold liver? 
 Shri Mataji: It’s for hot!
 [?] is for the allergies, you can apply it. 
 [Inaudible conversation]
 Mostly, you have hot liver, all of you are right-sided. Not her, but everybody else. 
 Alexandre: She said, she is the exception.
 Shri Mataji: Yes, but she’s all right, she has a little left-side problem. She has to use more light. You have to use more water.
 You people should not use more light. No hot, not the spices. 
 Everybody has in the West, there’s nothing to worry about [?] Just don’t worry. 
 Sahaja Yogi: Suzon and Didier got married seven years ago but they ask you if they could be married with, by you. 
 Shri Mataji: Yes, by all thoughts, right, yes. When you’ll come for Vishnu puja, we’ll have these marriages. 

Sahaja Yogi: Can you say how can I explain the Last Judgement, they are waiting after death [inaudible] all people are standing one by one like this to get the Judgement. How can I explain to them? 

Shri Mataji: You see, Judgement after death, in the sense that when you get Realization your egg’s stage finishes off, I mean, you become a bird now. You get the dead [inaudible]. So, one thing dies and it’s like the flower dies and the fruit comes in. 

Sahaja Yogi: I mean the difference between- it’s explained in the Koran that [inaudible] comes after the death, you see. 

Shri Mataji: Not in the flesh, nothing is of the flesh but of the Spirit, you see, when this Spirit goes, the darkness comes out [inaudible]. Realization is actually – what did he say in the Koran? – It’s like another birth. First, you are the Spirit [inaudible] a second birth. 

Flesh is different from Spirit. When the Spirit emerges out then the flesh goes [inaudible]. It’s very symbolic, Koran is the most symbolic book but they don’t understand, you see. Like he said: "At the resurrection time, your hands will speak." He just talked about Kundalini and ascent; you see. Any one [inaudible] I would say [inaudible] is very symbolic, Tao is symbolic. Any master, the way [inaudible]. It’s only the Indian scriptures who have revealed it very clearly to explain this thing. You can [inaudible] all of them and start a dictionary.

Alexandre: Mother, it’s really time. 

[Cut in the video] 

[Shri Mataji is walking away.] 

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. 

Marie: Thank you Mother. 

Shri Mataji: Hope to see you, all of you, all right? Bye, bye, bye-bye, everyone.
