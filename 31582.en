Shri Mataji: So, is there any other problem?

Are you all right?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. 
Alexandre: He has a pain in the sternum.
Maire: A little bit. 
Shri Mataji: Hold your breath. 
And ask in your heart, hold your breath, ask in your heart: "Are you the Mother of the universe?"
Thrice. Then expire. Thrice.
It is coming. [Laughter] 
[Inaudible] So much vibrations, just feel the vibrations. 
[Laughter]
So, I talk and vibrate. Here I talk and I get the vibrations. [Shri Mataji put the mic above her left ear, on her head.]
So, vibrations are better. 
[Laughter]
Sahaja Yogi: It’s a new model, 
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s a modern one. 
Shri Mataji: Modern. 
[Laughter]
Sahaja Yogi: I tried to have two microphones.

Shri Mataji: How you are, better? How is he? 
Are you married, mister?
Alexandre: This one? He is still a student. 
Sahaja Yogi: Not this one, Didier. 
Alexandre: Didier? 
Didier: No, I don’t want to.
Alexandre: He is working in France. [Inaudible]. He is a plumber.

Shri Mataji: London is looking for plumbers. With the Golden builders there is only one plumber. 
You can earn a lot of money there also. [Inaudible].
Shri Mataji: How many people are unemployed? 
Sahaja Yogi: Now, two million are. 
Shri Mataji: But in England it is [inaudible].
Do they get dole here? 
Alexandre: Yes.

Shri Mataji: What is your idea of marriage? Do you want to marry and what nationality? 
Daniel: Italy, Australia and France and India.
Shri Mataji: In India now, we have been exhausting the number of women. [Unsure].
[Laughter]
Alexandre: Next generation. 
Shri Mataji: Maybe one or two. 
[Laughter]
What about you to go and marry in India? 
Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know. I don’t think I’d like to marry someone because of the rationality of the Spirit, Mother. 
Shri Mataji: Rationality of the Spirit. [Inaudible]. I wish I speak all for you. [Unsure].
Rationality of the Spirit, all of you are. English are not so well. 
[Laughter]
[Inaudible].
But I must say it was a very, very great success in Paris, very great success. Lots of [inaudible] I was very surprised, I didn’t expect [inaudible].

Last Sahasrara Day we had it in Bombay on an island, on the seashore, all wild and desert island [Gorai Creek]. And I saw the trees there, coconut trees. And a coconut is called as "shripala" is the fruit of the Devi. And a coconut represents- represents- the Sahasrara. Like we have the scalp, and we’ve got the black, the white – what you call- the grey matter, the white matter and inside this thing, it’s the Sahasrara, is the limbic area inside that is the spinal fluid. So, [inaudible] the trees and this breeze, brought by the sea, turns them towards the land. But they bend down towards the sea because the sea is their guru. So, these coconuts trees that despite the fact that they have to spread things, the coconuts, all over, they still bend down towards the sea. It’s something remarkable because such a pain, all trees can bend towards the land. All of them bend towards the sea. And what they do is to suck in that salty water, you can say, and make it a sweet water. [Unsure]. And it’s what you have to do is to take all this salty water from the Bhavasagara and make it sweet. This time again we saw beautiful Sahasrara patterns in the chapel. Alexandre: In the sky, Mother? Shri Mataji: No, no, in the chapel- of different chakras. So, this is how for ten years, something very well established the Sahasrara Day, it works out automatically. Nature, everything works for you. They asked Me that the weather should be all right. I said: "You don’t worry. You’ll get a perfect weather." All the flowers bloomed out [inaudible] just play your part of the game. And you must play the tapes simply try to understand and find out the questions and ask Me. And also, later on you see, you’ll get the tapes from England [inaudible]. Easter, I used to talk very well about the Resurrection part and how we have to manifest it. And I said: "I will not take a sari on Easter day." So, they collected some money and they said: " [inaudible] what to do with it?" I said: "You should buy something for yourselves." So, they had given Me some eggs done by the Sahaja Yogis themselves, all kinds of designs. And in the market, I went and there I saw a beautiful basket of- just like a bandhan- of glass, inside were all stuffed birds. Juts like a bandhan. And there were birds. So, I told them now the eggs have become birds. 17:21
