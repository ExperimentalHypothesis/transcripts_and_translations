Morning talk to Yogis, Krishna Puja seminar. Schwarzsee (Switzerland), 23 August 1986.

It’s so gratifying and joyous to see all of you here, today, assembled to do Shri Krishna Puja.

Can you hear Me there? No? Can’t hear.

Gregoire: Phil, can you connect back...

Shri Mataji: To see so many Sahaja Yogis assembled here, I’m sure the devil must have run away long time back.

And the caravan must have left but I hope we are aware of it and we forget about our fears of our catches, of our past, of all the nonsense we have done so far.

Suddenly in My presence, I think, people get into a sense of guilt. I’m here to soothe you, to cleanse you, to make you beautiful and not to feel guilty.

Actually, when we start looking at ourselves, the first thing we notice is that there’s a block on the Agnya, but this block in the Agnya is the worst thing that can happen to us because it is the door of the Kundalini.

She reaches up to Vishuddhi, all right, and when She has to move forward, this Agnya stops it. That’s why we have left Vishuddhi, we have all the Vishuddhi problems.

The flow cannot take place. Also, this is one of the reasons we feel guilty - because of left Vishuddhi. It’s a symptom of a disease.

Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna. So we have to understand, first of all, that we are Sahaja Yogis. We are not ordinary people or we are not people who have not known the truth; we have known the truth.

We have to be completely aware of it.

That’s one truth if you establish, you have established yourself quite a lot.

Now the ordinary people as you have seen on Oxford St., you see, they wear dress - Indian dresses funnily tied; they don’t know how to tie it up, dhotis and saris, and they shake their heads and buy some of these, what we call them, shindis or bodhis or I don’t know what you call, tails, pigtails, and attach them with some glue and they start dancing.

When they dance, their pigtail falls off, and the saris and the dhotis, everything start opening out. That’s a very funny, ridiculous scene, I tell you. One side you see the punks and another side you see this nonsense, in the name of Shri Krishna, that’s even worse.

Punks do not do it in the name of, I don’t know if they do it in the name of King Solomon.

But they do it in somebody’s name, these people that is so great as Shri Krishna.

On the contrary, Shri Krishna’s hair are described in all the books and in all the poetry that poets could sing about. He was never shaven-headed. It is impossible to understand how these people got the idea that you must shave your head.

So the Shri Krishna’s aspect of Yogeshwara has been so misunderstood. It’s absolutely misunderstood because we cannot understand that the truth is covered with maya, always.

And you should keep maya on one side and go to the truth. Instead of that, we get lost in the maya, like very simple example, as it is, that He is a Yogeshwara; so these people have idea of a yogi, that he should be shaven, he should wear that dhoti, dirty one, and must put on a pigtail. Another concept, maya is a concept. And when you start living on those concepts of your own, you may gather it up with something else, you may think that Christ was a person who was a sannyasi, who used to wear another kind of a robe and He had a beard and He had hair like this. All those ideas, “So if we become like this, we’ll be very great yogis.”

These are all our concepts about someone whom we have never seen, whom we have never known. And because we live in those concepts, we get limited.

It’s very difficult for these people to break through because maya can only be broken through Realization.

That’s why first thing in Sahaja Yoga is Realization.

Get your Realization. You are a drunkard, all right, get your Realization. You are a drug addict, get your Realization.

You are a bad man, get your Realization. Anyone, get your Realization first; put the light first into a person.

Let him see for himself.

So all this identification with different concepts is responsible for giving us a very mayavi or illusive personality. We live in an illusive personality, live with it, enjoy it and we think we are perfectly all right.

Now if you are aware you are Sahaja Yogis and you have come here for Shri Krishna Puja, what is the preparation we have to do?

We’re Sahaja Yogis, we know about Kundalini, we know about Vishuddhis, we know about Shri Krishna.

All right, how are we going to prepare ourselves for the puja of Shri Krishna?

First of all, He tried to break all the concepts. First the concept He broke was that you have to be like a ascetic to look at. He broke this concept; He lived like a king.

In His childhood He used to go and play with the cows. And there He would use a peacock’s feather to decorate Himself, and He would listen to beautiful music of the river Yamuna and reproduce it.

He was Leeladhara, He was the one who created all kinds of mirth. What is mirth in French? They don’t have mirth, I believe.

Gregoire: I don’t understand, Shri Mataji... Yogis: Mirth.

Gregoire: Mirth... they don’t.

Shri Mataji: Eh? No?

Yogi: Fun.

Gregoire: No, it’s not fun... Sweetness.

Shri Mataji: It’s not fun, it’s more than..., it’s mirth. Mirth is sweeter than fun.

Gregoire: Sweet fun...

Shri Mataji: All right, sweet fun (laughter).

What a word! (Shri Mataji laughs. laughter) Sweet fun! This is mirth, now what is happening to you is mirth. I’m creating mirth in which you feel tickled, you know. Mirth is something where you feel tickled.

So, He tried to create mirth, never seriousness but He was not frivolous. He was Yogeshwara Himself. He was not frivolous.

So this difference between frivolity and mirth is to be understood only through Him because He’s also discretion.

Mirth is joy-giving, frivolity is destructive. Anything frivolous if you do...

[Please close it, isn’t it? There’s something problematic.]

So, we have to be in a state of mirth, so no question of feeling guilty comes in, we are not prisoners, are we?

We are prisoners of our own concepts and our own ideas and our own degradation. We degrade ourselves, God does not.

So we should be in the state of complete mirth and enjoyment.

Now it has rained, all right. That’s a very good thing to happen today. Yesterday I was listening to the program, I was just smiling, because I knew it would not work out that way.

Gregoire: Everybody knew, Shri Mataji...

Shri Mataji: And in India, on this day, when they celebrate, in the morning, children of the village or children of the particular areas gather together. And for them the house-holders tie up a little pitcher, which we call as a matka, and in that there is money, anything valuable they want to give to the children, sweets, everything put inside that, and is tied up in the air.

Normally it rains, if it doesn’t rain then they pour water on the children to make them feel it’s raining. Rain is very much connected with Shri Krishna. So the children come and they go in a way that the taller boys are first, then smaller, then smaller like a pyramid they go up till at the end there’s one boy who’s sort of representing Shri Krishna and then he breaks that. And from there everything falls down and flowers, everything on them, they take the money, they take all those things and start enjoying.

Then they go to another place, the whole day they are moving in the city like that and every good householder ties that matka for these children, for them to come and enjoy themselves. That’s in the real sense, is the Krishna Ashtami in Gokul where He lived as a child. Now why is He so much connected with rain? Once all His friends and He were looking after the cows and Indra felt that He is very powerful, somehow, I don’t know, He gets into jealousies sometimes.

And He sent rain to test His patience, His leela, His play, His mirth. And it rained and rained and rained and they did not know what to do.

So there was a mountain called Govardhan. Shri Krishna lifted it with His stick or His finger and just put it up on top of His finger, like that (Shri Mataji raises right forefinger). That’s why He is called as Govardhan Dhari.

And the whole mountain was on top and all the children joined Him and all the cows and He asked the children, “You also put your sticks up to help Me.” And they all put their sticks and standing very sweetly holding the Govardhan. That is one of His names, Govardhan Dhari.

So the rain had to come and the cows with their bells have to remind us.

And imagine the lake has a name which is a black; Krishna means black, Krishna word itself means black.

How Sahaj the whole thing has worked out!

Can you see the coincidences are so Sahaj but are so planned?

And here we are sitting, it’s raining, nicely enjoying everything. But on the contrary, when we start not enjoying, we play into, either into our ego or superego.

Supposing we are starved people, tortured people, then we start making others like ourselves. We like to make them suffer and torture them. That’s why I always say, “Poverty is leprosy.” Anybody who is in poverty can develop horrible things within themselves. It is never to be sided with, not to be sympathized but to be completely eradicated.

Another side is the ego where we try to dominate others and enjoy that. There’s no joy, there’s no joy in dominating others and saying things to others. I was sorry to hear yesterday that there are some girls who are married, some Indian girls who are married and their husbands are not respecting them and troubling them. It hurt Me very much.

That shows they’re so low-level people, very low level. Such a mediocracy, such useless people. They should have never come to Sahaja Yoga and deceived us like this. They will go to hell direct; I can tell you this (much).

Now there are some who are caught up with their superego; they suffer from some sort of a funny Sahaja Yoga schizophrenia. And they don’t want to get rid of it. They just don’t want to understand that they’re not normal people, they have to be perfectly all right. They make everyone miserable, jump on to all the places where they should not be.

Like a person who has got, say, example, tuberculosis, a disease which is contagious. Must understand he has got tuberculosis, keep out, don’t give it to others, at least.

But those who have got badhas will definitely come, either they’ll give big lectures. I start seeing them like big bhoots speaking, or if not - they have badhas then they will come at a place where they should not be. They’ll put their hands in the prasada, they’ll be sitting in the puja in the front, all kinds of things they’ll be doing, catching people. And they enjoy it because they are identified with the badhas. How will they improve?

There’s one fellow who is a bhootish fellow, we have had him for, I think, at least for a century I should say, and he’s giving lectures to others, You must clean the shoes of all the Sahaja Yogis to get rid of your ego.

So such a gross, depraved and low-level people are still in Sahaja Yoga.

So the enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga becomes less. If you eat rice with stones in it, how will you enjoy it? And that’s what it is.

We are here to enjoy the blessings of God, to have the mirth but still we are living with all joy-killing things that we have. How are we going to get rid of those things?

So, at least we do not become thorns in the lives of others. So the so-called free will, I’m happy Rustom has told you about it, is nothing but your ego and superego because you’re not in the center. In the center, you have nothing but freedom, that’s all, nothing but freedom; nothing like free will, freedom, complete freedom. There’s nothing like will or nothing like bhoots, nothing like bondage, it’s entire avenue of freedom.

Then this freedom is the knowledge, this freedom is the love, this freedom is the discretion. Then you say God gives you freedom and others freedom equally; then you act which doesn’t bound you nor anybody else because it is knowledge, it is discretion.

Age does not matter, what age you are. I’ve seen some also very old people singing beautifully and enjoying Sahaja Yoga and make Me enjoy also. Life is for us to enjoy, nothing else. But because we’re not free people, we cannot enjoy. There is no bondage of any evil thought which keeps you down.

It is so subtle but penetrating into every that is gross, that is Shri Krishna’s beautiful flute which creates a picture of the nature (Shri Mataji looks outside, ndt). The description (Sanskrit words), the whole thing becomes silent like a picture.

So, this evening we’ll have the puja, we’ll have all the enjoyment of Shri Krishna’s blessings upon us. There’s no end to the stories of Shri Krishna, all full of mirth and play and innocence that kills rakshasas, devils.

So today I’ve talked to you about His childhood, and the puja I’ll tell you about Gita.

May God bless you.

Some water.

Gregoire: Would You like a cup of tea, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Water.

Gregoire: Tea is ready... water...

Shri Mataji: Please, I’ll have some water.

You all are catching from Vishuddhi, I must say, very badly. And I’m full of it, here. (She touches Her throat) All My vibrations are just flowing from here. So I would say that you all should say “Allah Hu Akbar” sixteen times just now.

Gregoire: We get up? (To yogis) Get up.

[Yogis say “Allah Hu Akbar” 16 times]

Shri Mataji: Feeling better now? (She laughs)

If you go out, keep your Vishuddhis covered, but I don’t think anybody should go out today - in a way is good, for the puja - after the puja tomorrow. Then watch your Vishuddhis to be alright today, that’s why it has rained, I hope you don’t mind (laughter).

Gregoire: Please sit down, everybody.

Shri Mataji: Ah, you wanted to have some bhajans, something?

Gregoire: Would You like some bhajans now?

Shri Mataji: Could have it...

Gregoire: Good idea. (To yogis:) Can we have some bhajans? One or two first songs? “We are the world”, okay.

Warren: As well as of saying “God is great”, can we say “Mataji is great”, somehow? Somehow is there some way by which we could say that? Because still it’s catching.

Gregoire: Let’s have “We are the world”. Eh?

Shri Mataji: All right.

Gregoire: Ah? What is it?

Shri Mataji: When we say...

Warren: Mother, can we say “Shri Mataji” is great? Again...

Shri Mataji: Might be. Might be. Think it now, what they say?

Gregoire: Fantastic. Okay. We are going to sing “We are the world”... (video interruption)

[Sahaja yogis sing an adaptation of “We are the world” dedicated to Shri Mataji. Then yogis applaud and Gregoire makes a sign to stop]

Gregoire: It’s not necessary to applaud at ourselves!

Shri Mataji: I was just waiting for Me to clap, but... everybody applauded (laughter). It’s good, you see, a very good song. But I think little change would be needed, to be good from vibrations point of view. All right? Now. Let’s have another one.

Gregoire: Can we have the Italian one? What is it? Wait one minute, because we are going to distribute the copies... to distribute the copies. Shri Mataji, the story of this song, the music of this song is that there was this big musical which was organized to raise money for Africa. And they took the music and they changed the words. It’s a song which is coming from America. And... one day....

[Shri Mataji (talks to the children): See how she’s sitting? You sit all of you like that. Melania’s sitting properly, like a yogi (Shri Mataji laughs).]

It’s written in English or in... It’s done in English or in Italian?

Yogis: In English.

Shri Mataji: Oh, good. How many of you know Italian?

(Shri Mataji raises Her hand) I’m going to join! (laughter, She laughs) Alright. That’s all. That’s one of the nearest language, I think, one can learn very easily.

Gregoire (in Italian): Shri Mataji ha chiesto quanti sono quelli che parlano italiano, poi ha detto: “Io posso anche alzare la mia mano”.

Shri Mataji: But you must learn English first! (Laughter, Gregoire translates into Italian) And the Spanish is another language one can learn easily, if the Spanish learn the English (Laughter, Gregoire translates into Italian, Javier translates into Spanish). Or Hindi, one of the languages that I know (Javier translates into Spanish). I also know American English, you know? (General laughter and applause, Shri Mataji laughs)

Vishuddhi’s very much cleared out, can you see that? Very good.

Gregoire: We worked on the United States by singing this, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Yes. Good. I’m going there. Alright, start it now. Antonio is going to start...

Gregoire: It’s coming.

Shri Mataji: Coming.

[Yogis start singing a song to Shri Krishna in English]

Shri Mataji: Beautiful song, eh? What a nice song. Beautiful. Wonderful... (Shri Mataji claps, applause) It’s a real fast (...), I must say. Beautiful. Very nice.

Gregoire: Which one next?

Yogi: Germany.

Yogi: Belgium.

Yogi: Belgium.

Yogi: We have a German song all in English.

Gregoire: What else?

Yogi: French song in English, Swiss song in English... (laughter)

Gregoire: Whatever you desire, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Anything, I’m alright for everything...

Yogi: The English, in English.

Yogi: We can start with the English in English! (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: Thank you (She is given a piece of paper, possibly a copy of the song)

It’s for English in English! (Laughter)

Yogi: Does everybody have one page?

Yogis: No, no.

Gregoire: It’s one song to Lord Krishna.

Shri Mataji: Great (She laughs and applauds), wonderful! Nice power is shown! May God bless you all for this.

Now, who else? Another? French, of course! Beautiful. That’s very nice song, I should say, like a marching song, is good idea.

Yogi: The French song.

Yogi: The French song.

Shri Mataji: Very good one! For the French to sing this I’m very happy. You won’t believe! “Les miserables”, you see, people with the background. It’s a great, eh? To see you all smiling like that! It’s great! Imagine, what a transformation (She laughs). Real transformation, I’ll say.

[The French song is about “the Joy of the Kingdom of God”]

Shri Mataji: That’s a good preparation for the Krishna Puja, so wonderful, you see, to hear this from the French specially. May God bless you. Now, who else?

Yogi: Swiss song in English.

Gregoire: Swiss song in English, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Good idea. I should get one paper. That’s a good idea, that every country should have one song, you see, to be sung, so that everyone gets the chance, and to make a nice positive song.

Yogi: In the page of the Swiss song you have also the German song, so you keep the page after.

Shri Mataji: Pen.

Yogi: So, the title is “Seed in the Earth”. [Swiss song begins. End of video]

May God bless you.
