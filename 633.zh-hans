桑格拉提节崇拜

Sankranti Puja  印度Kalwe  1990年1月14日

Hindi part:

Today’s auspicious occasion is being celebrated everywhere in India. The reason is that the Sun which has left us, has left India, and had moved towards the Tropic of Capricorn, has now returned. And along with the movement of the Earth and the Sun all the vegetation, all the crops, fruit and other things are growing. The time has come for their growth. And all those trees whose leaves were completely removed in the cold weather, appeared as if they have completely died, all those trees are again awakened and started to become green. And that’s why, the significance of this time is that the Earth will again become green, and activities will start again everywhere. Especially in Northern India, where it gets very cold, it is a very special festival, that the sun has arrived and all the work dependent on the Sun will be completely fulfilled now.

So today I transmit best wishes to everyone here. And on today’s auspicious occasion, I could meet you all here. This is also a great joy for Me, I feel. As we consider Sun's appearance as a very great thing, it is much more important, that the Sun of Sahaja Yoga comes on this Earth. Because whatever creativity is in this Universe, the creativity is nourished by the Sun. The Sun gives it the energy, and the creative power of the "Paramchaitanya", its aspect of action, has got activated through Sahaja Yoga. Till now Paramchaitanya was not successful in any task. The reason was, that the Sun had not yet appeared in its courtyard. But now this Sun has risen in the courtyard of Paramchaitanya. And because of that you all have the light of it within you. Because of that light, your Kundalini has awakened, and within you, the field of creation has fully blossomed. And this field of creation you all are developing, in a way that the whole world can benefit from it. And it's a very great and divine thing. This could not take place earlier. In our country many sages  have expressed many ideas about, that such a day will come, when collectively this creation will get awakened.

That creation has awakened now. And that’s why this is not only an occasion for Earth's creation but a great occasion for Sahaja Yoga's creation also. This year specially is considered to be a very important year for Sahaja Yoga, and the light of Sahaja Yoga will establish very deeply in the people. When something starts to establish deeply, then we must understand that along with it, some other important events also take place. Like those who are evil and want to destroy the world, and those who are creating terror, destroying the best things of the world, all such people are consequently destroyed. As soon as saplings start blossoming and if they carry truth within them, they will wreck havoc in the place they cannot blossom and they will destroy everything. In the same way, all the evil temperaments, all the devilish forces, will be destroyed. Like after the Sun appears, all the gloom, all the darkness, is destroyed.

Similarly when the light of Sahaja Yoga emerges then the darkness of ignorance and wickedness, is totally destroyed. So today we are at the brink where we have to take a very high flight. And in this flight we have to understand that we should give up all the burdens within us. We have many types of beliefs, we have many types of wrong faiths, and also there are all types of ignorance within us. We should renounce all this ignorance and with a complete detachment, we should take this flight. And those who cannot detach from ignorance, those who do not get rid of it, such people will not be able to take this flight.

All of you know the significance and divinity of Sahaja Yoga; you are not ordinary people. And that’s why I want to say that those who want to fly higher and want to raise higher, should give up the burden of the many shackles of traditions. Similarly within us, ego and vanity are like a very big mountain. We should destroy this mountain completely too. And we can accomplish that, through meditation, and by completely immersing in Sahaja Yoga, by completely surrendering to it. The person who doesn’t surrender to Sahaja Yoga, is still incomplete, and it's possible to be left behind during this flight, to go to the same hell where others are going. So it's important that everyone strives thoroughly. All those who put efforts and try half-heartedly, I want to tell them, "Please renounce this half hearted effort". Because of this half hearted effort, you cannot achieve anything. Then how can you achieve that great state for which people used to cleanse by penance for thousands of years?

There is no need to belittle or punish yourself, but we must understand that today we are facing a mirror, and we have to completely remove all the defects visible in us. When you observe yourself from outside then you will understand that you have to destroy all these things. By this happening, you will notice that you receive many blessings from God. And receiving those blessing human beings will think that, "I have achieved everything". This is also a great fascination, that I have received this or that, all the worldly things. And like this, when we want to get something, at the periphery of this there are some things which can also mesmerize. But we shouldn't stop there. We have to achieve a great speed. This is the result of good deeds of your many lives and you have to achieve it completely. And we have to renounce those small, petty desires within us, and become completely surrendered and give full contribution to Sahaja Yoga. Only the one who will do this, will achieve it. The one who will not do it, because of any reason, I can tell you openly, that there is not much place in the kingdom of God. Those who want to go there, should think, if they really want to reach there that they have to get rid of all the burdens.

And we have to take just one path, our full efforts should be in one direction, that we should somehow march in this direction and keep progressing. Every year you need to introspect and see how much you have progresses since last year. Are we making excuses and thinking that "we have to do this", "this is important, that is important", or from our heart we want to ascent? And many people also think that through Sahaj Yoga, they will get rid of illness or will get their problems solved, that this will happen, that will happen... They should know that there is only one solution for all the problems, that we should reach that state which is absolute. Then all the things get solved by themselves. You don't need to do anything. So today I have shared with you my opinion. But I want that you should also take a resolution in your heart. What I am saying appears to be very simple, but the temperaments and activities of human beings are so strange that I am also not able to understand them. They say "If you can understand Him, then how can He be God?" but I say "If you can understand him, then how can he be human?" Because human beings are so complicated, so complicated, that to understand them is very difficult. I request all of you that if you have to achieve divinity, the complicated nature should be completely reprimanded, and it should be renounced to. And you should say that you want to achieve that divinity by which anything that you touch gets nourished, vibrated and beautiful. Your life will also become very beautiful very ideal, very joy giving, full of love, and of a very high level.

Infinite blessings to all of you.

在印度,今天是要好好庆祝的日子,因为太阳运行至南回归线,再从南回归线到达北回归线。当太阳回到地球,母亲大地的所有创造力便开始起作用。她创造了漂亮的东西如花朵,具滋养性的东西,以及使人满足的东西如果实。她所创造的草木令我们的眼睛安静下来,太阳的出现赐予我们多方面的祝福。

同样地,霎哈嘉瑜伽的太阳已经升起,到达最高点。它肯定显示了大地原理的成果,那就是你的根轮。你的根轮的创造力便是你的灵量,它不停地上升,上升,开启你们的存有(being),显示你生命的成果。它令你的生命非常漂亮,非常喜乐,非常快乐。现在我们正身处将要发动的新的跃进,那新的飞跃的起点。为着这飞跃,我们必须在观念上、思维上和制约上变得轻巧。我们的思想充满着制约,我们身上有着各式各样的思想制约。它们是那么牢固,令我有时也不能明白人类。我不能明白为甚么我们可以因为执着于一些没有价值,没有意义的事物而迷失。在将要发生更高的跃进的时刻,很多人会落后,不能从中走出来。所以在这阶段,我请你们全心全意去静坐,顺服委身于集体。在每一天,黄昏时,你必须想想,我为霎哈嘉瑜伽做了些甚么?我又为自己做了些甚么?请你明白你将会有一个非常大的跃进,那跃进必须启动,为此我希望你们准备妥当。你须要完全的准备就绪,因为在这跃进中,你可能会迷失,很多人可能落后,因为他们不能克服自己的思想制约。

思想制约是各式各样的_________无知、盲目的相信和各种我们经历过的事情。还有,我们对国家、种族、个人风格,以及种种判断别人的制约。我们必须判断自己,我们是否在霎哈嘉瑜伽文化之中?若你不在霎哈嘉文化之中,对你将会是非常困难,你像登上一艘不会启航的船。我现在忠告你,那么你之后不能怪责说:「母亲,很多人落后了!」若你发觉任何人落后,请帮助他,请以清晰的理念,肯定的语气,清楚的指示去纠正他。若你真的发觉有人犯错,你最好先忠告他。我今天告诉你这些是因为你将要起程,你必须告诉你的同行者,这是一个非常关键的时刻,没有人能把霎哈嘉瑜伽视为理所当然的。

所有其他的事物只是幻象,使你感到世俗的事物没有问题,你可以掌握世俗的事情。神并不关心那个人富有,那个人贫穷,祂只看那人灵性上是否富足。祂并不介意你受过甚么教育,你的程度如何,你是否华而不实等等,祂只看你是否纯真。

你为霎哈嘉瑜伽做了多少工作?你为神的工作做了些甚么?所有这些先后次序必须改变,我们必须明白霎哈嘉瑜伽以非常精微的层次审判我们。在这最后的审判,你们被判定为好人。在你将要作的第二次跃进,你们必须非常小心。或许你们之中有些人在心里以为自己是霎哈嘉瑜伽士,但可能他们实际上并不是,他们在将要发生的大跃进中会被遗留下来。

太阳已经升起,这是非常重要的。它已经到达最高点。当太阳到达最高点,我们必须非常小心。给予我们漂亮、青绿草木的太阳,同样会给予我们烧焦的热力,所以要小心。我们须要醒觉,必须每时每刻在霎哈嘉瑜伽的指引下,明白我们犯了些甚么错误,甚么令我们感到那么沉重,那么困难。

到目前为止,我非常高兴,无论我告诉你们甚么,教导你们甚么,你们都很平静,很甜美地接受,亦尝试把我的教导融入你们的生活中。事实上,一段时间之后,我想我不须要告诉你们甚么。你拥有自己的光,分辨甚么是对,甚么是错。但我仍要说,特别是西方人,在崇拜中,在音乐中和在每样事物中,你们必须开放你们的心。若你们不能开放你们的心,事情是不能成就的。因为它借着住在你心内的灵成就事情。所以,请对任何事物开放你的心。当你决定为霎哈嘉瑜伽开放你的心,你所有的自我、所有的思想制约都会消失。

愿神祝福你们
