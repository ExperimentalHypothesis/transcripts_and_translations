Dr Rustom: OM. This is the great Gayatri Mantra, which-Shri Mataji: This is right side.Dr Rustom: Right sided. And we refer to the seven main layers in the cosmos.

Means burning.Shri Mataji: Penance, Christ’s life was a tapah. And also, the Surya has got the light. Surya also has got the fire. The heat is tapah. So, this is tapah. [Showing the Agnya chakra] Then Satyam. At the Sahasrara, you know the truth. All right?These are the seven.Dr Rustom: Say it again ?[Shri Mataji nodded]Dr Rustom: Om Bhuh, Om Bhuvah, Om Swaha, Om Mahah, Om Janah, Om Tapah, Om Satyam, Om Tat savitur Vareṇyaṃ Bhargo Devasya dhimahi dhiyo yonah prachodayat Aum apo jyotiras’omrutam, Om Brahma Bhur Bhuvah Swarom.

Dr Rustom: That means, people who say these names will get success in most things: in studying, in marriage, in anything.Shri Mataji: In all kinds of hurdles. He is the one who is the clearer of hurdles.

Dr Rustom: That’s right. Now [from Mangal patha mantras in 'Rig Veda', 4]:

It should be written down.Dr Rustom: When we go to India.Shri Mataji: Ah. In India, you correct it, you see, they have put it much wider possibilities than that.Dr Rustom: Because this is a small one.Shri Mataji: Yes, we must put that. All right. So, whatever we have got, whichever way we have been able to achieve it, whatever things we get for the puja, in our own small way, we want to do this worship.

Dr Rustom: Visho-dosho-pa chhala pujam aham karishye tatva-da nirvighno to sidhyatam Maha Ganpati pujanam kurmah.Aam tatha sharira shuddhyatam shudhayatam nyasam kalasha shankha ghanta pujanam kurmah.Shri Mataji: All the other pujas, we do of the Kalasha which represents the Kundalini within us. And a ‘shankha’ is the sound. Shankha is, actually represents the seed.Dr Rustom: Omkara.Shri Mataji: Omkara, we can say the seed, the naada [sound] it’s the movement with the sound. And then ‘ghanta’ is to call people everywhere, you know, when there is a worship always there is a bell ringing, you see, that is good for all the negativity to run away. What else?Dr Rustom: That’s all Shri Mataji. Ah ‘deepa’, the flame.Shri Mataji: Accha, deepa. Also, to the light, worship the light also. Now, can you put these for the Ganesha. Now will you read Calin [unsure]? What? English would be better about Ganesha, OK?Now who’ll wash?Get some water and sit.

Shri Mataji [To Derek]: I think you can go in the back, so there is more place here. Yes, it’s better.You can come forward a little, you can sit here. Now it’s all right, you can sit here. Now come forward, little bit. Now, you have to wash, look after the flower, all right? Just bring the flower forward. Now, one by one, just wash my feet.Two of you, all right? Now you wash this one. [Inaudible]

Sahaja Yogi: Let us hear now which has been done or being done and will be done. It is You who supports all things that re supported. It is You who protects all things that are protected.It is You who is the complete All-pervading Spirit of divine energy. Think clearly, speaks only the truth.Let your presence awakened in us by Kundalini, speak.Let your presence awakened in us by Kundalini, listen.Let your presence awakened in us by Kundalini, bless.Let your presence awakened in us by Kundalini, protect.Let your presence awakened in us by Kundalini, your disciples. Be the disciples.You are the essence of all sacred literature and holy words.And You are the energy that understands holy words ...[Puja goes on while a Sahaja Yogi reads a kind of Ganesha Atharva Shirsha in English. Sahaja Yogis are instructed how to wash Mother’s Feet, then silent meditation]

[Conversation between Shri Mataji and Sahaja Yogis about what has to be done next.][33:07 Shri Mataji and Sahaja Yogis discuss about a dry towel to protect Shri Matatji’s sari.]

Sahaja Yogi: Kalashysa puja?Shri Mataji: Ok. Kalasha puja.[Sahaja Yogis discuss about a dry towel to dry Shri Matatji’s feet]

Dr Rustom: Kalashasya Mukhe Vishnu Kante Rudra Samasritha

Shri Mataji [about the puja objects]: These are all symbolic things, all right? Before realization, no worship has any colour [unsure] because you have no vibrations, nothing is sanctified, that’s why it is said not to bow to anything, don’t go into rituals. If you go into rituals without Realization, it’s a problem. After Realization now, everything has a meaning.Sahaja Yogi: Can you give me the coconut?Shri Mataji: This represents Shri Ganesha.Dr Rustom: Kalashasya Mukhe Vishnu Kante Rudra Samasritha.Mule tatra sthitho Brahma madhye matrugana smruta.kukshou thu saagara sarve sapthadveepa Vasundhara.[Vishnu resides in the mouth of the Kalasha, Rudra in the neck of the vessel.At the bottom Brahma resides. In the middle are the divine Mothers.In the stomach, are all the seas and seven islands on this earth]Shri Mataji: These are the seven, seven-Dr Rustom: Contenents.Shri Mataji: Seas. No, oceans. Oceans are vibrating.

Dr Rustom: Prithvit mantrasya mer pulastaya rishi kurme devataSutalam chhandha kurmo devata asana shodhan viniyogahShri Mataji: This is the Putri. It’s the Mother Earth [Shri Mataji is touching the coconut]Dr Rustom: Om prithivyai tvaya dhrita loka devi tvam vishnuna dhrutaTvam cha dharaya Mam Devi Pavitram kuru ChasanamIsti asanam vidhayaOm apa samarpam tute bhutaye bhut bhumi sansthite ye bhutaVighna karta rapte gachhantu shivajnyaya apakramantuBhutani pisachsa sarvato disham sarve kshama virodhen puja karma samarabhye

Shri Mataji: That’s why we said to her that, “We awaken you, o Mother Earth.” So that you get rid of all negativity, all the ‘pisachsa’, all these horrible people. And that’s why we use this [a coconut] when there is any problem in the house. What we do, is to take this and put it in the Mother Earth you see, vibrated things, so that the Mother Earth gets awakened. And she looks after that part. So, she doesn’t allow any ‘pisachsa’ to come in.

Dr Rustom: Atah shadang nayasa.Now we purify the six parts of the body.Shri Mataji: Yes, we have to clear the six parts of our body.Dr Rustom: First, the heart.Shri Mataji: [Unclear] to the heart.Dr Rustom: OM bhur bhuva swaha hitayaya namah

Dr Rustom: Next the top of the head.Shri Mataji: That is, we bow to our heart.Dr Rustom: OM bhur bhuva swaha shirse swahaShri Mataji: Sahasrara.

Dr Rustom: Then the Back Agnya.OM bhur bhuva swaha shikayaya vashatShri Mataji: ‘Vashat’ is like this. [Shri Mataji claps her hands] That means you bring two fingers, bring it round and hit it hard, on the Sahasrara [on the palm of the hand]. That is taking out the baddha, you see. From here, take it out and put it on the Sahasrara, hit it hard. And this is the ‘Samhara Shakti’ of Shri Krishna [destructive power].

Dr Rustom: OM bhur bhuva swaha kavacha ahamShri Mataji: Kavach. Kavach is bandhan.Dr Rustom: OM bhur bhuva swaha netrayaa vashatShri Mataji: You see, eyes are cleansed; must have clean eyes. Again, with the clean eyes you again go back at the Agnya, at the Back and take it down.[Sound of Sahaja Yogis clapping their hands with their two fingers]

Dr Rustom: OM bhur bhuva swaha astra vaphat.Shri Mataji: Astra. Astra are the weapons that you have got. Astra vaphat![Shri Mataji claps her hands]. Means all the baddhas should run away.

Dr Rustom: Now the bandhan: 'Iti dig bandhan'.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]Shri Mataji: Kavach – Kavach is the cover, Kavach is the cover.Dr Rustom: Shield like.Shri Mataji: Shield, shield, shield, Kavach. Kavach is shield, sorry. Kavach is shield! [Laughter. Hindi] And this is bandhan, sorry.

Dr Rustom: Rigvedah, yejurvedah, sam-vedah yatharvana angeshcha sahitah sarve kalasham tu samashritahAtra gayatri savitri shanti pushti kare tatha ayantu deva pujarthan durita kshayakarakaha.

Then the mantras for the ‘sapta nadis’, for the seven rivers:OM Thames, Derwent, Trent, Ooze, Don, Forth, seven jalesmin sannidhim kuru-Sahaja Yogini: Seven?Shri Mataji: Seven rivers of England. So, the ego of English should go away, worked out. [laughs]Sahaja Yogini: Hopefully.Dr Rustom: Kalashaya namaha.Sarvopacharathe gandakshatapushpa samarpayami.[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi].Dr Rustom: ‘Pushpa”, one flower.Shri Mataji: This is- we are sort of honouring the rivers; five Rivers that they should get awakened and those who drink water out of those rivers should have the Nabhi by which they should seek God through all the rivers.

Dr Rustom: Now the conch, 'Shankar'.OM shanka dev, Chandra devayatam kuksha varuna devata praste prajapatimvidhya agrey ganga Saraswati tamam pura sagaro utpanaVishnuna vidhutta kare namit sarva deva cha panchjanya namostute.

Shri Mataji: Now see at the back, it is three and a half coils [on the base of the conch]. Can you see clearly? And when it moves in that, you see, in the same way, that Kundalini moves spirally. The whole universe moves in a spiral way. I don’t know if the scientists know this or not but it moves in a spiral way. And this is what is the spiral [the conch]. And when you blow into it, it makes a sound, you see, OM as they say: A U M. Three words are there: that is Mahakali Mahalaxmi Mahasarawati - I’m sorry, Mahakali, Mahasaraswati, Mahalaxmi. Now these things, when the Kundalini also moves, she makes sound. All those sounds are based all the alphabets and consonants of the, consonant of the Sanskrit language. For example, here it is all of them are: "er ar ee i oo", like that.So this is the sound which is heard in mantras when you say that, that’s how the Deities get awakened because they know these words, you see, and every sound has a meaning.

Dr Rustom: OM pancha janayaye vidmahe pavanaye dhimahi tanaye shakhaya prachodayat shakhaya namaha.

Shri Mataji: [Speaks in Hindi] Whatever you do, is these five things to wash my hands.

Dr Rustom: That’s right. Also Shri Krishna is becoming conscious [unsure].Shri Mataji: Would be good.Dr Rustom: Then the worship of the bell.Agamartham tu devanam gamanartham tu raksasam kurve ghantaravam tatraDevatah vana lanchanam.Shri Mataji: This is for all the rakshasas to run away, to get out of this puja, once we see it’s a garuna here.[Shri Mataji rings the bell] It’s done. All right. [Laughter]Dr Rustom: Gandha akshata pushpam samarpayamiDr Rustom: Now the flower.

Dr Rustom: Now the deepa.

Shri Mataji: Deepa is the light. That’s very important. Because that’s the light that represents the light within us.Dr Rustom: Deepa devta bhyo namaha gandha kshata pushpam samarpayamiShri Mataji: [Speaks in Hindi] There are flowers here on the side. There are many open flowers this side. Do you see?

Dr Rustom: Deepa devta bhyo namaha gandha kshata pushpam samarpayamiHaridrama kumkumam samarpayamiShri Mataji: Haridrama is Haladi.Dr Rustom: Haldi.[Conversation about haldi, Kumkum,turmeric.]

Dr Rustom: Bho deepa brahma rupas tvaṁ Jyotis tvam prabhu ravayaat, yaavad puja samaptihi. Syatavatavam srushtiro bhavah.To keep doing the main puja.Shri Mataji: We’ve done it now. With this, you can do the puja.I think that would be better to wash the hands. Don’t you think?What is that water you have taken out?Dr Rustom: That’s your feet water.Shri Mataji: Feet. So, you have taken out some water also. This first one, this one is first part? You can put it in there. This can be given to the garden.Sahaja Yogi: This is [inaudible]Shri Mataji: No, this one you can put it in this garden.Shri Mataji [to Alganesh]: Gracie.

[50:43 End of verification]

Yogi: Now the five nectars – Ghee

[Yogi continues mantra]

Yogi: Little bit of water

[Yogi continues mantra]

Shri Mataji: Madhu. Which one are you saying?

Yogi: Milk

Shri Mataji: No, should be Madhu [mantra continues] Milk now.

Shri Mataji: All the people, all of the Devas are fond of Ghee And what is Chandra... what?

[Yogi answers, reading Sanskrit name.  Continues mantras]

[discussion of temperature of water]

Shri Mataji: Next time [.....UNCLEAR]. Vibrations are flowing]

[54:40 Sound of pouring water]

Some more water should be poured, after sugar also.

[mantras continue]

Shri Mataji: See - Indra right side.[UNCLEAR] is right side, alright? Then is Varuna. Varuna is sea – see, all void Guru - Grahaspati.

Yogi: Guru [UNCLEAR], the right void

Shri Mataji, Yes, on the right side.  Mitra also. 

Yogi: [recites some names] Mitraya, Vayu also.

Shri Mataji: You see the thing is, when on the Sankranti, when the day changes, on the 14th of January when the Sun changes over, then they give the sweet,[UNCLEAR] saying that, “We’ll give you the sweet and speak to us in the same way in a sweet manner” - so friendship.  Sugar gives you friendship. You give sweets to people to establish friendship. 

But salt also gives you the Emans, you call it. If you eat at somebody’s place, it’s not only friendship but it is also...even if you eat at somebody, enemy’s place, it’s sort of a... you cannot insult that food, you cannot insult that person.

[more discussion of what to pour next on Shri Mataji’s Feet]

Sahaja Yogi: Water with camphor and chanda...   

Shri Mataji: Camphor and Chanda are two extremes. That’s very good: camphor and chanda.  Because camphor is something that gives you heat and chanda is something that cools you, so the both are of light. Camphor and Chandan. Chandan on the right.

[Sahaja Yogi continues mantra]

Shri Mataji: Camphor is very good for people who suffer from cold and Chanda is very good for people who suffer from heat.

Yogi: Next we offer flowers and turmeric [Mantra]

[Shri Mataji gives instructions as where to put things, eg “Up a little bit”.]

Yogi: Now some incense and [UNCLEAR][Mantra]

Let’s show Shri Mataji the lamp.  [Mantra]

[UNCLEAR something to eat?] [Further discussion, mantra continues]

Shri Mataji: Prakshalana is ‘to wash’ - means you have to do water now. prakshalana is ‘to wash’.  And just take a little katori or something to wash my Hands. Mm, alright.

[more discussion, mantras continue]

You go on saying the mantra, you can then apply the kumkum...

[UNCLEAR discussion. Mantras continue]

1:04.00

Shri Mataji: Vibrations started.

[UNCLEAR discussion. Mantras continue]

This is all asking for all the prosperity of the... must get horses, must have cows and land and...

Sahaja Yogi: Elephants.

Shri Mataji: Elephants, goats, all kinds of things. Apart from that you have houses – must have these huge houses, palaces, you see.  Everything you need to ask.

[mantras continue] I think [UNCLEAR]pragnya - that means ’To your subject, give them life, long life’.

[Mantras continue]

All the five elements should be their properties, you see so that they should be masters of all these five elements. Even Indra, Brahaspati, everybody – all the stars. [Mantras continue]

[‘Sobham’?] is this vibrations, you see. [Sobham] But actually [sobha?] stands for Chandrama.  But because this moon is the representative of the Spirit, so it is called also [sobham biba?]. [biba??] means ‘let us bring the... vibrations’ 

Sanctified water is sobham.  Or you can say vibrations.

Aah, ‘So don’t take away my anger, my jealousies, my greed and my inauspicious mind.  I worship You through Shri Sukta, especially the Devi and I worship You through Her stanzas of praise to achieve...’ What is it?  [Yogi repeats phrase] ‘Make us full of Punyas so that we do good things, righteous things.’

We must [UNCLEAR] the punyas, you see that.

[Yogi continues mantra]

Shri Mataji: You give us the blessings... Praising the Mother, you see... That, ‘You are... with Her Lotus Hands - white hands. You give us this blessing.  You are the consort of Vishnu and also You are the... You are fond... [Madhuva?], Krishna is fond of You, very much fond of You...’ And what else is there?

Yogi: Kshamadevi

Shri Mataji: You are the Goddess of forgiveness.

‘You are the One who is the... worshipped by Lakshmi’... and what else?

Yogi: Sakim Devi Namami

Shri Mataji:  And You are the friend of all the Goddesses’ Sakim Devi. So I bow to You.

Achuta  is the name of Shri Krishna – ‘You are the power of Achuta’, means Shri Krishna.

[Praises continue]

[1:12:59 – new mantra/praises begin]

So the thing is the description comes because Shakti is everywhere; without the Shakti, nothing exists.  So that’s what they are saying that, ‘You are this, You are that.’  That is true. 

[Praises continue, Shri Mataji translates some Names]

‘You are the Creator of the Supreme Mother’

These are the left side – all the Powers of...

Yogi: Mahakali. Mahakali Stuti

[1:15:56 – sounds of Puja continue, Shri Mataji giving instructions ‘They should be able to see... flowers... remove the [??]’

That’s alright.  Keep that on the side....  Take this to the back

Yogi: Shall we take the next... Shiva [Karnam?]

[new praises begin]

1:19:21 [UNCLEAR?]

Shri Mataji: Bhasma is a ‘ashes’.  And also, to’ bhasma’ means also to make it into ashes.  He is fond of ashes. Why?  Because he’s so full of ice.  But actually, when He destroys, he uses those ashes on His Body: take the ashes on His Body.    

Yogi: Also with His Eyes...

Shri Mataji:  Mm?  Yes, He can.

[praises continue]

Shri Mataji:  Adi is Primordial...  See, He’s just [UNCLEAR Sureshwara?]

Karuna is compassion.

[1:23:43 – UNCLEAR Amruti?]

[Praises continue, Shri Mataji continues to instruct yogis performing puja]

[1:28:06 short silence, then new Stuthi [to the Devi?] begins]

Shri Mataji:  This is a...you see that, Swarup – everybody She gives realization: Mukti [UNCLEAR ?].  And also resides as awareness, as buddhi – intelligence. 

[Praises continue]

Shri Mataji [correcting pronunciation]Parayana – is the one whose interest is all on the other people.  Parayana.  Others – not interest in Herself.

[Shri Mataji instructs regarding putting sari on] Get seven married ladies.

[1:32:10 – sounds of unwrapping the new sari]

[1:32:31 – the video has moved on and Shri Mataji is in the middle of telling a story to the yogis]

Shri Mataji: Near Veret and when we went into Veret, I had a very big vegetable, this thing – only it was such a thing that I got, I think twenty nine prizes for those. All the prizes I got!

Yogi [reading from ?]: ‘At that very period, I shall slay the great Asura named [Durgamam?], thereby you shall have the celebrated name of Durga Devi and again, assuming a terrible [?] in the mountain Himalaya, I shall destroy the Rakshasas for the protection of the Munies.  Then all the Munies, bowing their bodies reverently, shall praise Me, and thereby I shall have the celebrated name of Ima Devi, and the Asura named Aruna shall work great havoc in the three worlds, having taken a collective bee form, consisting of innumerable bees, I shall slay the great Asura for the good of the three worlds.’

Shri Mataji: This will happen now in Vienna, because in Vienna there are some sort of a... bees, so I’ve seen to it that they will die.

Yogi: And a bee came in Vienna... when You were doing Puja.

Shri Mataji: Ah, one bee came in...

Yogi: That’s right.

Shri Mataji: You see, and we killed them.

Yogi: ‘And then people shall laud me everywhere as Pramadevi,

Shri Mataji : Pramadevi

Yogi : And whenever trouble arises due to the advent of the Danavas, I shall incarnate and destroy the foes.‘ Shall we read it in Sanskrit? The vibrations are there.

[reads in Sanskrit whilst yoginis are placing a sari around Shri Mataji.  Photos are taken]

1:36:45

Shri Mataji [indicating to someone] You come here...

Yogi 2: Is the flash (from camera) too much for You?

Shri Mataji:  No, no.

Yogi 2: [UNCLEAR] these flowers are beautiful.

Shri Mataji: Innocence. Alright now?  [Let them come?] Let’s see, [UNCLEAR]

[Yogi 1 continues saying mantras]

Everybody should be allowed [ie: to take photos]

[UNCLEAR Hindi spoken] Tying up.  Just tie it. [UNCLEAR the feet?]

[Hindi spoken.  Small laughter]

Yogi: No time.

[More mantras]

Shri Mataji: See, Brahmapadi. You have got now Brahmapad. You have already got Brahmapad – is the position of the Brahma. That She gives you Brahmapad. You have got Brahma isn’t it? So unique...

Yogi: Give some perfumes to Mother’s Feet.

Shri Mataji:  Perfume.  The ladies should put in the hand... This is ladies’ job. 

[1:42:16 more mantras whilst flowers are tied round Shri Mataji’s wrists and arms]  This is just to worship all the chakras.  [A garland is placed over Her Head]

Is it to be put... here? This kind... [indicating for crown to to be tied/placed on Her Head] This kind...[Hindi or Marathi spoken as She adjusts the crown]

Yogini: Do you want that tighter, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Tighter. A little bit tighter. You make Ekadash. This is for your Ekadasha.

[Mantra to Ekadasha Mukuta (crown?).  Shri Mataji then combs Her hair and yogi says another mantra...for hair! And then more mantras]

Shri Mataji:  Ah... To pacify the Ekadasha.  Mm...That’s why Christ was given... excited the Ekadasha.  He was [given up?].

[short silence as kumkum is painted on Shri Mataji’s Hands.  When they have finished, She holds them up – left hand receiving, right hand giving (Christ’s pose) - more photos taken.]

 Now, if you would take a full photograph... would be good idea.  Just move out a little bit... so they can take a full photograph.

[small discussion about the light/closing the curtains so there is some kind of a background for the photos, something that would hide the window.  Indoor light is switched on. Shri Mataji smiles patiently whilst everyone takes photos.  She asks one yogi something about his camera.  He replies ‘I’m waiting for it to warm up’.]

Shri Mataji [to a yogini]: What’s happened to your camera?

Yogini:  I never had one.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] You see, all of you get such good photographs, that these cameramen cannot.  They just don’t have that.  Vibrations are there.  But the Mahamaya is on top, you see... They can’t cross over. [UNCLEAR]

[To someone else]  Come, come, come... take a photo.

What happened?

Yogini: It’s finished (the film in camera)

Shri Mataji:  It’s done now.  May God Bless you.

Now, shall we have the Aarti?

And also, you people, because this is also for cleansing of the Cambridge... you can bring. Join there.  Where’s your husband?  There.  You have got them also here, Cambridge people – because this puja includes the Cambridge also.  Where is [Jay?]

Yogini:  He’s coming, Mother.

Shri Mataji:  Yes, all of you join like this. All the Bedford people... come.  Hold his hand.  Hold his hand.  Hold hands, each other, that’s all.  You hold his hand.  Alright?  You hold her hand.

[Aarti is sung, followed by [Guru stotra ? 2:03:05], followed by Jai Jagadambe x 12 (for centre heart), followed by Allah hu Akbar x 16 (for Vishuddhi), followed by prayer in Hebrew & English – ‘Shema Yisrael, Hear O Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is One.  Blessed be the name of His glorious Kingdom, that witnesses for all eternity. Amen.’ - and ‘The Lord’s Prayer’ x 3 (both for Agnya), followed by The Three Maha Mantras. ]

Shri Mataji: Lie down. [ All Namaskar]

May God Bless you.  May God Bless you.

[Shri Mataji removes Her crown and all the flowers and garlands around Her.  The video has moved on a bit whilst She has done this]

Shri Mataji:  What is that cloth?

Yogi: That’s one we gave to You earlier – at the Ganesha Puja.  It’s the one that we gave to you, in Ganesha Puja.

Shri Mataji:  You gave it to Me?

Yogi: In the Ganesha Puja.

Yogi: You were in Switzerland, Mother.

[She is then given a big cloth, different to one She was looking at, to place over Her knees and offered a big bunch of grapes, which She smells and then hands back, but eating one.  She then vibrates a plate of fruits and other Prasad offered. A joke is made [UNCLEAR]] 

Shri Mataji:  All the Sahaj Yogis are there. 

[She gives instructions about offering Her Prasad (married ladies) using both their hands.]

What you do..the married ladies can do.

Everyone can come, one by one.  All of them are married, so they are auspicious. 

[She calls for one specific yogini to come forward]

Ann, Ann?  May God Bless you.  Good. 

[Ladies on by one are offering Prasad. 2:17:40 UNCLEAR]... best to put both hands together. May God Bless you.

Take both hands together.  May God Bless you.

May God Bless you.

You have more married than unmarried.

[As Shri Mataji looks down at the cloth holding all the Prasad in Her lap ‘You have soft shampoos’ ie. the cloth feels very soft...]

May God Bless you.  Good.

May God Bless you. Good.  Alright? You’re feeling the cool breeze?

Yogini:  Yes I am, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Good.  That’s great. Alright. 

Shri Mataji : Hello william

William you want to come here? Hello, you put him in, I’ll take. You just put him here. [She kisses him] He’s so very happy. Good. Alright?

Alright, come.  Very good.  May God Bless you. Good, good.

So, this Puja was done very well, I must say.  Everybody’s done now?

Others are waiting the [....UNCLEAR] to be married, I think. Alright, may God Bless you all.

All yogis: Jai!

[speaks in Hindi(?) as She hands over the cloth filled with Prasad]

See, whatever is given to the mother has to be eaten by her children, isn’t it? The mother doesn’t eat much.

[She speaks to a yogini at the back who didn’t yet offer any Prasad]

Inder you gave Me fruit? Why? Come along, [....UNCLEAR] away. You shouldn’t do it like that. Come here. Hmm. May God Bless you. Put both the hands like this, like this... Ya, see, underneath...good. May God Bless you.

Growing, very well. Who’s crying like that? Is that...?

Yogini: They’re laughing, they’re playing.

Shri Mataji:  Now, what do we think of our... should we...I mean, if there’s long enough, we’ll have some food.  [UNCLEAR]

Yogi: Even a quick one will do.

Shri Mataji:  Maybe a chance. [UNCLEAR making a joke]

Work has started, in all earnestness.  You all have to prepare yourselves, and everybody must see that they learn Sahaja Yoga very well: how to give realization to others, how to talk about Sahaja Yoga, how to improve yourself. All these things must be done.  Otherwise you’ll have to face a crowd and you will not be prepared and they’ll be frightened, they’ll think, ‘These people don’t know anything’ and they’ll just [deny??].  For all the newcomers, and those people who have come now, especially people of, say, Northampton or Bedford or Cambridge -  where this news has spread.  All have to be very well equipped and prepared for it.  You see, unless and until you are prepared, I cannot attend to them.  So  you should try to get all the books – all the small little books – then all the... what do you call... pamphlets, photographs...all these things should be collected.  And you should be prepared.  Let some things vibrated by Me, like water – you have got now vibrated water – you can put it into another water, it will be alright.  Then get sugar vibrated, other things vibrated, other things vibrated.  And for this Panchamrita that you’ve got now, better have it for your Nahbi.  Keep yourself clean, first of all, and when you talk to others, show that composure and that peace that is now residing in you.  The more you show, the more it will express itself.  Alright?  And be wise, because you will now face many people, and if you are doubtful and if you are still going up and down, they will not be there and you’ll be responsible for driving them out.  Alright?  So have people who are positively there and you can attend to them, talk to them properly; now you have become saints – saints must behave like saints, responsibly.  Alright?  So I’ll leave it to you. 

If you have any problem, you can always ask the people in London to send you [what thing?], whatever you want, you can get.  Alright?And come down now on the 17th , all of you. ... to learn that ....Somebody’s crying, whatever is it?  I think [UNCLEAR]

Yogi:  He’s just excited

Shri Mataji:  He’s crying?

Yogi:  Laughing, Mother. 

Yogini: They’re throwing stones at each other.

Yogi: Shrieking with laughter.

Yogini: Kevin’s in charge.

Shri Mataji: Kevin? Then it’s alright.

For next year, I won’t be here [UNCLEAR] and other things,  you have got a whole year to work it out, and so the temper should all go down. And also, you can call people from... to begin with, some people can come work here.  Then also, she was saying that, if somebody can come and stay with her, she’ll be very happy – to help with the beginning of the program.  So some people can come and stay with her for a few days, and work it out. If somebody can come and stay with Maria, should try to come and stay here.  Would be good idea to work out Sahaja Yoga in this area. 

Keep all your ornament [....UNCLEAR]

Yogi: These came back from Vienna, Mother.  Look at this. 

Shri Matai:  This is not mine, this is...

Yogi:  Could they be from Machindranath?

[discussion about the jewellery She has been handed]

Shri Mataji:  Could be Aradhana or somebody.  Anupama’s maybe. This might fit Auriol or someone.  Auriol is bigger than Anupama, isn’t she?  Maybe this might fit about little Olympia, because Auriol, I have got a watch for her, so give her this - for Olympia, if she is there.  And for... in My coat there is a watch for Auriol.  Everything that belongs to Aradhana, Anupama goes to, greatly. How are...they’re alright?  Little bit... [UNCLEAR] Because such a Sahaja Yogini as Anupama is... Did you get the watch please? 

Yogi: Olympia’s very much attached to both the girls.

Shri Mataji:  I know, eh.  Ya, I know, I know.  All the time.  Olympia? They have to send Lily.  You see, they had planned that they’ll go to ashram and they have to send Lily because they’re...you see they wanted to extend their stay and... but the ticket was a problem and they had to leave suddenly.  Where is she? 

Yogini:  Olympia, come in darling, Mother wants to see you.  She’s coming, Mother.

Shri Mataji:  This is alright for Olympia.  This must be Anupama’s.  Olympia!  There’s something nice for you.  Oh, for your feet! Who’s going to wear that? Who’s going... now, I would like to give it to daddy, daddy will... this one, this one.  These are two, two of them.  Now, what about your socks, you have to take off socks – take off your socks.  Now, let’s do it.  Socks.  Where is the watch now? Where is Auriol? Can you set it somehow?

[To Olympia] Yes, Didi has sent, Didi... Nanu has sent it. Nanu.  Nanu and Didi have sent – one Nanu, one Didi. 

Olympia: Saudi Arabia

Yogi: Saudi Arabia, yes.

Shri Mataji: Huh? Saudi Arabia. [UNCLEAR] higher, tie it up a little higher.

[To Auriol] For you, get it set.  May God Bless you. Can you adjust it for her?

[To Olympia] What is happening?  Is it hurting her? It’s smaller than that, you can put one more chain... it’s alright.

Yogini: It’s a little bit tight.

Shri Mataji: Beautiful.  Saudi Arabia – first I didn’t understand what she was saying.

Yogi: It’s a little bit tight.

Shri Mataji:  What a Vishuddhi! 

Yogi [to Olympia] Do you want it on?

Shri Mataji: Alright, put it in her hand: best is to put it in her hand. In the hand, alright let her... Put it in the hand, like a bangle.  In the hand is good.  Good. Alright?

Yogi:  If you join the two together, it might make a necklace.

Shri Mataji: Ha? You can make a necklace... Ah, very good, very good, very good.  You put one more chain in there, you see... Olympia! [UNCLEAR ? Then Shri Mataji picks up Olympia and kisses her] This cold is too much for her...get cold too much. [using a tissue] Good for the nose. Good.  Beautiful.  This is Didi – Didi has sent this.  This is Nanu – from Saudi Arabia.  Alright?  I think Indian girls have smaller ankles, because they wear from childhood these things.  That must be the reason.  Bangles also, I think – we wear from childhood, that’s why our hands are more supple perhaps.  You’re going to fall down! Hold it, hold it, hold it now, give it to mummy... show her, show it to mummy.  Good.  Alright, now let’s go upstairs.  Mmm.  Nothing for the boys, poor things.  Auriol, nice? It’s working alright? Very close there[....UNCLEAR] Is it working?

So, shall we go upstairs now?  Then we’ll have our food and we start [mixing about??].

Yogis:  Thank you, Mother.
