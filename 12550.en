Shri Mataji: Shasti?
Yogi: Because full moon was on the 3rd.  Today is the 6th [UNCLEAR Shasti]
Yogi 2: Cancer moon, is it?
Shri Mataji: Cancer?
Yogi 2: I think so, Mother.
Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]
Yogi 1 : Full moon was on the 3rd Shri Mataji, at midnight.
Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] Alright, let’s see that.
Yogi 1: Have you got a newspaper please?
Shri Mataji: [In Hindi] Now we’ll lead the Thali again. [ Poor Hari??]
Yogi: It’s possible... we can ask vibrations actually.
Shri Mataji: I think... might be the better day.
[Hindi spoken]
Yogi (to Shri Mataji): I said, You are correct.
Shri Mataji: Vibrations came, eh? [All laugh]
[1:25 Yogi begins mantras. Collective says Three Great Mantras.
After 3:00 – 4:16 Yogi says names of Lord Vishnu ?]
[Shri Mataji speaking Hindi to yogi.  4:37-5:26 Mantras resume by Yogi]
Shri Mataji: This is action, you see, so right side – Pranaya.  Just to put it... [Shri Mataji is showing how to clear the nostrils, using thumb and index finger]
How you do it... you tell them.
Yogi: What you do is you take your hand like this, place these fingers on the left nostril, breathe in through the right nostril... hold it, for a short while, then put your thumb on your other nostril and breathe out through the left nostril.  Then breathe in through the left nostril, hold it, and then breathe out through the right nostril.
It should be done gently, you shouldn’t force it.  Once or twice is...
Shri Mataji: Thrice
Yogi: Thrice
Shri Mataji: Let’s put right hand on the...
Yogi: First put the right hand on the... right thumb on the right nostril, breathe in through the left - follow Shri Mataji as She is...
Shri Mataji: And also when you breathe out, keep it out for a while.
[several minutes of breathing through the nostrils]
Cleared out.  You have to clear out the sinuses and problems you see.... For Vishuddhi. Because...better.  It’s better now?
[UNCLEAR in Hindi]
Yogi:  This is the great Gayatri Mantra, which...
Shri Mataji: You see, right side
Yogi: Right sided.  And we refer to the seven main layers in the cosmos.  These are the seven names we take first.  [reads the Gayatri Mantra]
[Shri Mataji asks for them to be read again and then explains each one]
Shri Mataji: Bhu.  First is Bhu: Bhu is the Earth, Mother Earth.  What is the Second one? 
Yogi: Bhuva
Shri Mataji: Bhuva is Antariksha , is whatever is created, whatever is created Swadishtan. Then? Swah : Swah is Nabhi because it consumes... consumer. Swaha – it’s consumer, it consumes. Swaha.
Yogi: Ma
Shri Mataji: Ma is the Mother
Yogi: That’s right.  Janah
Shri Mataji: Visshuddhi
Yogi: for people, all the people...
Shri Mataji: Janah – Collectivity.  Tapah  Penance,  Christ’s life was Tapah.  And also the Surya has got the light... Surya also has got the fire - the heat is tapah, so this is tapah.  Then?  At the Sahasrara you know the truth.  All right?
[9:59 Yogi reads it again]
[10:28 Yogi reads an invocation to all the Deities]
Shri Mataji: What must be the Saint - Angel of the central of England?  What would be the Saint? 
Yogi: St George Mother
Shri Mataji: So you are praying to St George, alright.
[Shri Mataji then responds to each name as it’s read]
[UNCLEAR The Lord our] Father
Laxmi Narayana - Ya
All the Saints, all the realized Souls, to begin with, Saint...is evolved.
[Yogi reads the 12 names of Shri Ganesha]
Yogi: It means that people who say these names will get success in most things - in studying, in marriage...
Shri Mataji: All kinds of hurdles.  He is the one who is the clearer of hurdles. 
[Yogi reads names of the Goddess from the Devi Mahatmyam]
Yogi: Now we say where this Puja is being held and at what time.
[Yogi reads in Sanskrit. They include the locations Europe, England, and Northampton amongst the Sanskrit words]
Shri Mataji: Which is the River?
Yogis: The River Ooze, I think. (yogis were unclear about the physical location of Northampton and which river it was)
Shri Mataji: You should write it down all these things and keep it, it’s important.
[Yogi continues.  Shri Mataji corrects a pronunciation and then says, very good.  Yogi continues in Sanskrit with Shri Mataji interjecting with translations]
Shri Mataji: This is...Why are you praying? One – for all the Sahaja Yogis. Should have... now, what is this? shema? is very mean.
Stiriya means stability.
Rogya Aishwarya -all good health or prosperity.
To take away all the pains of the body - pains of all kinds pain.
All the [manora(t)?] -  means all the desires to be fulfilled of the Sahaja Yogis.
For the name of Mataji Nirmala Devi.
Also there is not the Sahaja Yoga... you give them and all that that is not there. Should be written down.
In India you correct it, you see they have put it much wider possibilities than that.
First put that, alright, so? Whatever we have got, whichever way we have been able to achieve it,   whatever things we get for the puja, in our own small way we want to do this worship.                                                                                                
All the other pujas we do of the Kalashya is to represents the Kundalini within us. And then Shankar is the sound... Shankar is actually represents the sea [UNCLEAR] Omkara or you can say the... the sea, the nada, movement with the sun.  And then [UNCLEAR] is to call people everywhere, you know in the... When there is worship always there’s a bell rung. 
That is good for all the negativity to run away.  What else?
Yogi:  That’s all Shri Mataji.  Oh the [deepa?], the flame
Shri Mataji:  [Deepa] - also to the light -  Worship the light also.
Now, can you put these for the Ganesha [UNCLEAR instructions for puja]
About Ganesha.   Now who’ll wash? 
Have some water.  [Shri Mataji instructing where people can sit] You can come forward a bit, you can sit here. Now... it’s alright you can sit here, now come forward.  Now, you have to wash... you have to look after the flower, alright?  Just bring the flower forward.  Now, one by one...two of you...
[Yogi reads Ganesha Atharva Sheersha in English while yogis are instructed how to wash Mother’s Feet, then silent meditation]
[UNCLEAR between Shri Mataji and yogis about what has to be done next]
[33:07 bell rings. Shri Mataji and yogis discuss which towels to use to dry Her Feet]
[33:41 Yogi says mantra in Sanskrit]
Shri Mataji: These are all symbolic things, alright?   Before realization, no worship has any [UNCLEAR] because you have no vibrations, nothing is sanctified, that’s why it is said not to bow to anything, don’t go into rituals.   If you go into rituals without realization it’s a problem.  After realization now, everything has a meaning.
This represents Shri Ganesha.
[Yogi says mantra in Sanskrit]
Shri Mataji: These are the seven seas, oceans: oceans are vibrating.
[Yogi continues mantras]
Shri Mataji: This is the Putri – is the [Mother Earth?]
[Yogi continues mantras]
Shri Mataji: That’s why we said to Her that, “We awaken You Oh Mother Earth.” So that you get rid of all negativity, for the pishachas... all these horrible people.
And that’s why we use this when there is any problem in the house,  what we do is to take this and put it in the Mother Earth you see, vibrated things so that the Mother Earth gets awakened and She looks after that part: so She doesn’t allow any [pishanchas?] to come in.
Yogi: Now we purify the six parts of the body
Shri Mataji: Yes, we have to clear the six parts of our body.
Yogi: First the heart.
Shri Mataji: Difficult, the heart.
[Yogi says Sanskrit mantra]
Yogi: Next the top of the head.
Shri Mataji: That is, we bow to our heart.
[mantra]
Shri Mataji: Sahasrara...
Yogi: Then the back agnya [mantra]
Shri Mataji: [Varshact?] is like this.  That means you bring two fingers, bring it round and hit it hard, on the Sahasrara.  That is taking out the baddha, you see from here... take it out and put it on the Sahasrara...hit it hard...and this is the Saumhara Shakti of Shri Krishna.
[Sound of yogis hitting the palms of their hands.. Yogi says mantra]
Shri Mataji: Kavach.  Kavach is bandhan.
[Yogi continues mantra]
Shri Mataji: You see, eyes are cleansed; must have clean eyes.  Again, with the clean eyes you again go back at the Agnya.  At the back and hit it down.
[Yogi continues mantra]
Shri Mataji: Astra.  Astra are the weapons that you have got - Astra [UNCLEAR Sanskrit].  Means all the baddhas should run away.
Yogi: Now the bandhan [Sanskrit]
Shri Mataji:  Kavach - Kavach is the cover, Kavach is the cover.
Yogi: Shield
Shri Mataji: Shield, shield, Kavach.   Kavach is shield, sorry Kavach is shield! [Laughs] And this is bandhan, sorry.
[Yogi continues mantra]
Then the mantras for the sapta nadis, for the seven rivers -
Om Thames, Derwent, Trent, Ooze, Don, Forth,  Severn...[continues in Sanskrit]
Shri Mataji: Seven rivers of England - so the ego of English should go away, worked out. [laughs]
[Yogi continues mantra]
[Shri Mataji and yogi speak in Hindi]
Shri Mataji: This is we are sort of honoring the Rivers; five Rivers that they should get awakened and those who drink water out of those rivers should have the Nabhi by which they should seek God.  [To/Through?] all the rivers.
Yogi: Now the conch, Shankar [mantra]
Shri Mataji: Now see at the back there are three and a half coils - can you see, clearly, and when it moves in that you see, in the same way that Kundalini moves spirally.  The whole universe moves in a spiral way.  I don’t know if the scientists know this or not but it moves in a spiral way and this is what is the spiral, and when you blow into it, it makes a sound - the Aum as they say A U M.  Three words are there – that is Mahakali Mahalaxmi Mahasarawati. I’m sorry...Mahakali Mahasaraswati Mahalaxmi.  Now these things, when the Kundalini also moves, She makes sound.  On those sounds are based all the alphabets and consonants of the... the consonant of the Sanskrit language. For example, here it is all of them are er ar ee i oo – like that.
So this is the sound which is heard in mantras when you say that, that’s how the Deities get awakened because they know these words, you see and every sound has a meaning.
[Yogi continues mantras]
Shri Mataji: [speaks in Hindi] Whatever you do is these five things to wash My Hands.
Yogi: Also Shri Krishna’s.... Then the worship of the bell [mantra]
[Bell rings continuously for a whole second (not just once) and loud, several times]
Shri Mataji: This is for all the rakshasas to run away, to get out of this puja, once we see it’s a [garuna?] here.
[More bell ringing]
Yogi: Now the deepa.
Shri Mataji: Deepa is the light - that’s very important. Because that’s the light that represents the light within us.
[Yogi continues mantra]
Shri Mataji:[speaks in Hindi] There are flowers here on the side.  There are many open flowers, you see?
[Yogi continues mantra]
[Shri Mataji and yogis speaking about kumkum and turmeric]
[Yogi continues mantra]
Shri Mataji: We’ve done it now - with this you can do the puja. I think that would be better to wash the hands... What is that, what you have taken out?
Yogi: That’s Your Feet water...
Shri Mataji: You have taken out some water or something?  [some discussion about what to do with the puja water, like putting it in garden]
[Yogi continues mantras]
Shri Mataji: This is the description of Lord Shiva.
[Yogi continues mantra]
Shri Mataji: Awahan is the invitation to the Mother.
[Yogi continues mantras]
Shri Mataji: Left hand you put towards me [UNCLEAR] and right like that for as long as you can do. You’re alright.
[Yogi continues mantras.  Sounds of Puja continue]
49:21
Shri Mataji: These are all Indian rivers. It’s alright because Indian rivers have been sanctified since ages now.
[Yogi continues mantras]
Shri Mataji : Let him do[....UNCLEAR] better or they can do or Gavin can do Gavin you sit down here that's better so that one person... you sit at Gavin's place, let him sit here....you come here.
You also now become an expert, you see...
[Yogi continues mantra]
Yogi: Now the five nectars – Ghee
[Yogi continues mantra]
Yogi: Little bit of water
[Yogi continues mantra]
Shri Mataji: Madhu. Which one are you saying?
Yogi: Milk
Shri Mataji: No, should be Madhu [mantra continues] Milk now.
Shri Mataji: All the people, all of the Devas are fond of Ghee And what is Chandra... what?
[Yogi answers, reading Sanskrit name.  Continues mantras]
[discussion of temperature of water]
Shri Mataji: Next time [.....UNCLEAR]. Vibrations are flowing]
[54:40 Sound of pouring water]
Some more water should be poured, after sugar also.
[mantras continue]
Shri Mataji: See - Indra right side.[UNCLEAR] is right side, alright? Then is Varuna. Varuna is sea – see, all void Guru - Grahaspati.
Yogi: Guru [UNCLEAR], the right void
Shri Mataji, Yes, on the right side.  Mitra also. 
Yogi: [recites some names] Mitraya, Vayu also.
Shri Mataji: You see the thing is, when on the Sankranti, when the day changes, on the 14th of January when the Sun changes over, then they give the sweet,[UNCLEAR] saying that, “We’ll give you the sweet and speak to us in the same way in a sweet manner” - so friendship.  Sugar gives you friendship. You give sweets to people to establish friendship. 
But salt also gives you the Emans, you call it. If you eat at somebody’s place, it’s not only friendship but it is also...even if you eat at somebody, enemy’s place, it’s sort of a... you cannot insult that food, you cannot insult that person.
[more discussion of what to pour next on Shri Mataji’s Feet]
Yogi: Water with camphor and chanda...   
Shri Mataji: Camphor and Chanda are two extremes. That’s very good: camphor and chanda.  Because camphor is something that gives you heat and chanda is something that cools you, so the both are of light. Camphor and Chandan. Chandan on the right.
[Yogi continues mantra]
Shri Mataji: Camphor is very good for people who suffer from cold and Chanda is very good for people who suffer from heat.
Yogi: Next we offer flowers and turmeric [Mantra]
[Shri Mataji gives instructions as where to put things, eg “Up a little bit”.]
Yogi: Now some incense and [UNCLEAR][Mantra]
Let’s show Shri Mataji the lamp.  [Mantra]
[UNCLEAR something to eat?] [Further discussion, mantra continues]
Shri Mataji: Prakshalana is ‘to wash’ - means you have to do water now. prakshalana is ‘to wash’.  And just take a little katori or something to wash my Hands. Mm, alright.
[more discussion, mantras continue]
You go on saying the mantra, you can then apply the kumkum...
[UNCLEAR discussion. Mantras continue]
1:04.00
Shri Mataji: Vibrations started.
[UNCLEAR discussion. Mantras continue]
This is all asking for all the prosperity of the... must get horses, must have cows and land and...
Yogi: Elephants
Shri Mataji: Elephants, goats, all kinds of things. Apart from that you have houses – must have these huge houses, palaces, you see.  Everything you need to ask.
[mantras continue] I think [UNCLEAR]pragnya - that means ’To your subject, give them life, long life’.
[Mantras continue]
All the five elements should be their properties, you see so that they should be masters of all these five elements. Even Indra, Brahaspati, everybody – all the stars. [Mantras continue]
[‘Sobham’?] is this vibrations, you see. [Sobham] But actually [sobha?] stands for Chandrama.  But because this moon is the representative of the Spirit, so it is called also [sobham biba?]. [biba??] means ‘let us bring the... vibrations’ 
Sanctified water is sobham.  Or you can say vibrations.
Aah, ‘So don’t take away my anger, my jealousies, my greed and my inauspicious mind.  I worship You through Shri Sukta, especially the Devi and I worship You through Her stanzas of praise to achieve...’ What is it?  [Yogi repeats phrase] ‘Make us full of Punyas so that we do good things, righteous things.’
We must [UNCLEAR] the punyas, you see that.
[Yogi continues mantra]
Shri Mataji: You give us the blessings... Praising the Mother, you see... That, ‘You are... with Her Lotus Hands - white hands. You give us this blessing.  You are the consort of Vishnu and also You are the... You are fond... [Madhuva?], Krishna is fond of You, very much fond of You...’ And what else is there?
Yogi: Kshamadevi
Shri Mataji: You are the Goddess of forgiveness.
‘You are the One who is the... worshipped by Lakshmi’... and what else?
Yogi: Sakim Devi Namami
Shri Mataji:  And You are the friend of all the Goddesses’ Sakim Devi. So I bow to You.
Achuta  is the name of Shri Krishna – ‘You are the power of Achuta’, means Shri Krishna.
[Praises continue]
[1:12:59 – new mantra/praises begin]
So the thing is the description comes because Shakti is everywhere; without the Shakti, nothing exists.  So that’s what they are saying that, ‘You are this, You are that.’  That is true. 
[Praises continue, Shri Mataji translates some Names]
‘You are the Creator of the Supreme Mother’
These are the left side – all the Powers of...
Yogi: Mahakali. Mahakali Stuti
[1:15:56 – sounds of Puja continue, Shri Mataji giving instructions ‘They should be able to see... flowers... remove the [??]’
That’s alright.  Keep that on the side....  Take this to the back
Yogi: Shall we take the next... Shiva [Karnam?]
[new praises begin]
1:19:21 [UNCLEAR?]
Shri Mataji: Bhasma is a ‘ashes’.  And also, to’ bhasma’ means also to make it into ashes.  He is fond of ashes. Why?  Because he’s so full of ice.  But actually, when He destroys, he uses those ashes on His Body: take the ashes on His Body.    
Yogi: Also with His Eyes...
Shri Mataji:  Mm?  Yes, He can.
[praises continue]
Shri Mataji:  Adi is Primordial...  See, He’s just [UNCLEAR Sureshwara?]
Karuna is compassion.
[1:23:43 – UNCLEAR Amruti?]
[Praises continue, Shri Mataji continues to instruct yogis performing puja]
[1:28:06 short silence, then new Stuthi [to the Devi?] begins]
Shri Mataji:  This is a...you see that, Swarup – everybody She gives realization: Mukti [UNCLEAR ?].  And also resides as awareness, as buddhi – intelligence. 
[Praises continue]
Shri Mataji [correcting pronunciation]Parayana – is the one whose interest is all on the other people.  Parayana.  Others – not interest in Herself.
[Shri Mataji instructs regarding putting sari on] Get seven married ladies.
[1:32:10 – sounds of unwrapping the new sari]
[1:32:31 – the video has moved on and Shri Mataji is in the middle of telling a story to the yogis]
Shri Mataji: Near Veret and when we went into Veret, I had a very big vegetable, this thing – only it was such a thing that I got, I think twenty nine prizes for those. All the prizes I got!
Yogi [reading from ?]: ‘At that very period, I shall slay the great Asura named [Durgamam?], thereby you shall have the celebrated name of Durga Devi and again, assuming a terrible [?] in the mountain Himalaya, I shall destroy the Rakshasas for the protection of the Munies.  Then all the Munies, bowing their bodies reverently, shall praise Me, and thereby I shall have the celebrated name of Ima Devi, and the Asura named Aruna shall work great havoc in the three worlds, having taken a collective bee form, consisting of innumerable bees, I shall slay the great Asura for the good of the three worlds.’
Shri Mataji: This will happen now in Vienna, because in Vienna there are some sort of a... bees, so I’ve seen to it that they will die.
Yogi: And a bee came in Vienna... when You were doing Puja.
Shri Mataji: Ah, one bee came in...
Yogi: That’s right.
Shri Mataji: You see, and we killed them.
Yogi: ‘And then people shall laud me everywhere as Pramadevi,
Shri Mataji : Pramadevi
Yogi : And whenever trouble arises due to the advent of the Danavas, I shall incarnate and destroy the foes.‘ Shall we read it in Sanskrit? The vibrations are there.
[reads in Sanskrit whilst yoginis are placing a sari around Shri Mataji.  Photos are taken]
1:36:45
Shri Mataji [indicating to someone] You come here...
Yogi 2: Is the flash (from camera) too much for You?
Shri Mataji:  No, no.
Yogi 2: [UNCLEAR] these flowers are beautiful.
Shri Mataji: Innocence. Alright now?  [Let them come?] Let’s see, [UNCLEAR]
[Yogi 1 continues saying mantras]
Everybody should be allowed [ie: to take photos]
[UNCLEAR Hindi spoken] Tying up.  Just tie it. [UNCLEAR the feet?]
[Hindi spoken.  Small laughter]
Yogi: No time.
[More mantras]
Shri Mataji: See, Brahmapadi. You have got now Brahmapad. You have already got Brahmapad – is the position of the Brahma. That She gives you Brahmapad. You have got Brahma isn’t it? So unique...
Yogi: Give some perfumes to Mother’s Feet.
Shri Mataji:  Perfume.  The ladies should put in the hand... This is ladies’ job. 
[1:42:16 more mantras whilst flowers are tied round Shri Mataji’s wrists and arms]  This is just to worship all the chakras.  [A garland is placed over Her Head]
Is it to be put... here? This kind... [indicating for crown to to be tied/placed on Her Head] This kind...[Hindi or Marathi spoken as She adjusts the crown]
Yogini: Do you want that tighter, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Tighter. A little bit tighter. You make Ekadash. This is for your Ekadasha.
[Mantra to Ekadasha Mukuta (crown?).  Shri Mataji then combs Her hair and yogi says another mantra...for hair! And then more mantras]
Shri Mataji:  Ah... To pacify the Ekadasha.  Mm...That’s why Christ was given... excited the Ekadasha.  He was [given up?].
[short silence as kumkum is painted on Shri Mataji’s Hands.  When they have finished, She holds them up – left hand receiving, right hand giving (Christ’s pose) - more photos taken.]
 Now, if you would take a full photograph... would be good idea.  Just move out a little bit... so they can take a full photograph.
[small discussion about the light/closing the curtains so there is some kind of a background for the photos, something that would hide the window.  Indoor light is switched on. Shri Mataji smiles patiently whilst everyone takes photos.  She asks one yogi something about his camera.  He replies ‘I’m waiting for it to warm up’.]
Shri Mataji [to a yogini]: What’s happened to your camera?
Yogini:  I never had one.
Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] You see, all of you get such good photographs, that these cameramen cannot.  They just don’t have that.  Vibrations are there.  But the Mahamaya is on top, you see... They can’t cross over. [UNCLEAR]
[To someone else]  Come, come, come... take a photo.
What happened?
Yogini: It’s finished (the film in camera)
Shri Mataji:  It’s done now.  May God Bless you.
Now, shall we have the Aarti?
And also, you people, because this is also for cleansing of the Cambridge... you can bring. Join there.  Where’s your husband?  There.  You have got them also here, Cambridge people – because this puja includes the Cambridge also.  Where is [Jay?]
Yogini:  He’s coming, Mother.
Shri Mataji:  Yes, all of you join like this. All the Bedford people... come.  Hold his hand.  Hold his hand.  Hold hands, each other, that’s all.  You hold his hand.  Alright?  You hold her hand.
[Aarti is sung, followed by [Guru stotra ? 2:03:05], followed by Jai Jagadambe x 12 (for centre heart), followed by Allah hu Akbar x 16 (for Vishuddhi), followed by prayer in Hebrew & English – ‘Shema Yisrael, Hear O Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is One.  Blessed be the name of His glorious Kingdom, that witnesses for all eternity. Amen.’ - and ‘The Lord’s Prayer’ x 3 (both for Agnya), followed by The Three Maha Mantras. ]
Shri Mataji: Lie down. [ All Namaskar]
May God Bless you.  May God Bless you.
[Shri Mataji removes Her crown and all the flowers and garlands around Her.  The video has moved on a bit whilst She has done this]
Shri Mataji:  What is that cloth?
Yogi: That’s one we gave to You earlier – at the Ganesha Puja.  It’s the one that we gave to you, in Ganesha Puja.
Shri Mataji:  You gave it to Me?
Yogi: In the Ganesha Puja.
Yogi: You were in Switzerland, Mother.
[She is then given a big cloth, different to one She was looking at, to place over Her knees and offered a big bunch of grapes, which She smells and then hands back, but eating one.  She then vibrates a plate of fruits and other Prasad offered. A joke is made [UNCLEAR]] 
Shri Mataji:  All the Sahaj Yogis are there. 
[She gives instructions about offering Her Prasad (married ladies) using both their hands.]
What you do..the married ladies can do.
Everyone can come, one by one.  All of them are married, so they are auspicious. 
[She calls for one specific yogini to come forward]
Ann, Ann?  May God Bless you.  Good. 
[Ladies on by one are offering Prasad. 2:17:40 UNCLEAR]... best to put both hands together. May God Bless you.
Take both hands together.  May God Bless you.
May God Bless you.
You have more married than unmarried.
[As Shri Mataji looks down at the cloth holding all the Prasad in Her lap ‘You have soft shampoos’ ie. the cloth feels very soft...]
May God Bless you.  Good.
May God Bless you. Good.  Alright? You’re feeling the cool breeze?
Yogini:  Yes I am, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Good.  That’s great. Alright. 
Shri Mataji : Hello william
William you want to come here? Hello, you put him in, I’ll take. You just put him here. [She kisses him] He’s so very happy. Good. Alright?
Alright, come.  Very good.  May God Bless you. Good, good.
So, this Puja was done very well, I must say.  Everybody’s done now?
Others are waiting the [....UNCLEAR] to be married, I think. Alright, may God Bless you all.
All yogis: Jai!
[speaks in Hindi(?) as She hands over the cloth filled with Prasad]
See, whatever is given to the mother has to be eaten by her children, isn’t it? The mother doesn’t eat much.
[She speaks to a yogini at the back who didn’t yet offer any Prasad]
Inder you gave Me fruit? Why? Come along, [....UNCLEAR] away. You shouldn’t do it like that. Come here. Hmm. May God Bless you. Put both the hands like this, like this... Ya, see, underneath...good. May God Bless you.
Growing, very well. Who’s crying like that? Is that...?
Yogini: They’re laughing, they’re playing.
Shri Mataji:  Now, what do we think of our... should we...I mean, if there’s long enough, we’ll have some food.  [UNCLEAR]
Yogi: Even a quick one will do.
Shri Mataji:  Maybe a chance. [UNCLEAR making a joke]
Work has started, in all earnestness.  You all have to prepare yourselves, and everybody must see that they learn Sahaja Yoga very well: how to give realization to others, how to talk about Sahaja Yoga, how to improve yourself. All these things must be done.  Otherwise you’ll have to face a crowd and you will not be prepared and they’ll be frightened, they’ll think, ‘These people don’t know anything’ and they’ll just [deny??].  For all the newcomers, and those people who have come now, especially people of, say, Northampton or Bedford or Cambridge -  where this news has spread.  All have to be very well equipped and prepared for it.  You see, unless and until you are prepared, I cannot attend to them.  So  you should try to get all the books – all the small little books – then all the... what do you call... pamphlets, photographs...all these things should be collected.  And you should be prepared.  Let some things vibrated by Me, like water – you have got now vibrated water – you can put it into another water, it will be alright.  Then get sugar vibrated, other things vibrated, other things vibrated.  And for this Panchamrita that you’ve got now, better have it for your Nahbi.  Keep yourself clean, first of all, and when you talk to others, show that composure and that peace that is now residing in you.  The more you show, the more it will express itself.  Alright?  And be wise, because you will now face many people, and if you are doubtful and if you are still going up and down, they will not be there and you’ll be responsible for driving them out.  Alright?  So have people who are positively there and you can attend to them, talk to them properly; now you have become saints – saints must behave like saints, responsibly.  Alright?  So I’ll leave it to you. 
If you have any problem, you can always ask the people in London to send you [what thing?], whatever you want, you can get.  Alright?And come down now on the 17th , all of you. ... to learn that ....Somebody’s crying, whatever is it?  I think [UNCLEAR]
Yogi:  He’s just excited
Shri Mataji:  He’s crying?
Yogi:  Laughing, Mother. 
Yogini: They’re throwing stones at each other.
Yogi: Shrieking with laughter.
Yogini: Kevin’s in charge.
Shri Mataji: Kevin? Then it’s alright.
For next year, I won’t be here [UNCLEAR] and other things,  you have got a whole year to work it out, and so the temper should all go down. And also, you can call people from... to begin with, some people can come work here.  Then also, she was saying that, if somebody can come and stay with her, she’ll be very happy – to help with the beginning of the program.  So some people can come and stay with her for a few days, and work it out. If somebody can come and stay with Maria, should try to come and stay here.  Would be good idea to work out Sahaja Yoga in this area. 
Keep all your ornament [....UNCLEAR]
Yogi: These came back from Vienna, Mother.  Look at this. 
Shri Matai:  This is not mine, this is...
Yogi:  Could they be from Machindranath?
[discussion about the jewellery She has been handed]
Shri Mataji:  Could be Aradhana or somebody.  Anupama’s maybe. This might fit Auriol or someone.  Auriol is bigger than Anupama, isn’t she?  Maybe this might fit about little Olympia, because Auriol, I have got a watch for her, so give her this - for Olympia, if she is there.  And for... in My coat there is a watch for Auriol.  Everything that belongs to Aradhana, Anupama goes to, greatly. How are...they’re alright?  Little bit... [UNCLEAR] Because such a Sahaja Yogini as Anupama is... Did you get the watch please? 
Yogi: Olympia’s very much attached to both the girls.
Shri Mataji:  I know, eh.  Ya, I know, I know.  All the time.  Olympia? They have to send Lily.  You see, they had planned that they’ll go to ashram and they have to send Lily because they’re...you see they wanted to extend their stay and... but the ticket was a problem and they had to leave suddenly.  Where is she? 
Yogini:  Olympia, come in darling, Mother wants to see you.  She’s coming, Mother.
Shri Mataji:  This is alright for Olympia.  This must be Anupama’s.  Olympia!  There’s something nice for you.  Oh, for your feet! Who’s going to wear that? Who’s going... now, I would like to give it to daddy, daddy will... this one, this one.  These are two, two of them.  Now, what about your socks, you have to take off socks – take off your socks.  Now, let’s do it.  Socks.  Where is the watch now? Where is Auriol? Can you set it somehow?
[To Olympia] Yes, Didi has sent, Didi... Nanu has sent it. Nanu.  Nanu and Didi have sent – one Nanu, one Didi. 
Olympia: Saudi Arabia
Yogi: Saudi Arabia, yes.
Shri Mataji: Huh? Saudi Arabia. [UNCLEAR] higher, tie it up a little higher.
[To Auriol] For you, get it set.  May God Bless you. Can you adjust it for her?
[To Olympia] What is happening?  Is it hurting her? It’s smaller than that, you can put one more chain... it’s alright.
Yogini: It’s a little bit tight.
Shri Mataji: Beautiful.  Saudi Arabia – first I didn’t understand what she was saying.
Yogi: It’s a little bit tight.
Shri Mataji:  What a Vishuddhi! 
Yogi [to Olympia] Do you want it on?
Shri Mataji: Alright, put it in her hand: best is to put it in her hand. In the hand, alright let her... Put it in the hand, like a bangle.  In the hand is good.  Good. Alright?
Yogi:  If you join the two together, it might make a necklace.
Shri Mataji: Ha? You can make a necklace... Ah, very good, very good, very good.  You put one more chain in there, you see... Olympia! [UNCLEAR ? Then Shri Mataji picks up Olympia and kisses her] This cold is too much for her...get cold too much. [using a tissue] Good for the nose. Good.  Beautiful.  This is Didi – Didi has sent this.  This is Nanu – from Saudi Arabia.  Alright?  I think Indian girls have smaller ankles, because they wear from childhood these things.  That must be the reason.  Bangles also, I think – we wear from childhood, that’s why our hands are more supple perhaps.  You’re going to fall down! Hold it, hold it, hold it now, give it to mummy... show her, show it to mummy.  Good.  Alright, now let’s go upstairs.  Mmm.  Nothing for the boys, poor things.  Auriol, nice? It’s working alright? Very close there[....UNCLEAR] Is it working?
So, shall we go upstairs now?  Then we’ll have our food and we start [mixing about??].
Yogis:  Thank you, Mother.
