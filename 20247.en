Ekadasha Rudra Swayambhu Shilanyas

[English translation from Marathi]

After Sahasrar ....   So beautiful !  It is  Trigunatmika . See one, two, three.  Can you see the Trigunatmika? This is Agnya here. Beautiful. When I say that,  it is even more. (collective laughter).   “break the coconut etc. here.”

Sahaj Yogi : “ yes , Yes will do.’

Shri Mataji : The things which saints and holy people express, nobody else is able to do so. Now all these  holy and saintly people are here to guide  you.. What name are you  going to call this by? The Temple? Because it is Sahasrara, all the seven deities are here” .

Sahaj Yogi : Well , Since ancient times this is called as Mhasoba.

Shri Mataji : “What?

Sahaj Yogi : “Mhasoba.”

Shri Mataji ; “Mhasoba ? Why was it named Mhasoba?”

Sahaj Yogi  : “ Many  deities hence Mhasoba is the name”

Shri Mataji  :  Several deities hence Mhasoba – Ekadash Rudra. Ekadash Rudra, Mhasoba is Ekadash Rudra what I mean to say is  that what Mhasoba is , is not understood by all”

Sahaj Yogi  :  It is  difficult to understand.’

Shri Mataji :  Then you may call it as Ekadash Rudra. Or this is Sahasrara means all seven deities are there. But all are pleased. But Ekadash Rudra means destructive power. Eleven. Also of the Trigunatmika. Whatever name you give,  one must understand it. What is the principle behind it.. Now we have three of them., isn’t it? ”

Sahaj Yogis : ”Yes”.

Shri Mataji  : “ Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati. Of these ”. (Shri Mataji is pointing towards Swayambhu.) ,” the middle one is Mahalakshmi and this is Mahakali and this is Mahasaraswati. This is the way it is created. (pointing towards the stone) and these are the Chakras in it. It is very beautiful. “

Sahaj Yogis  : “And these...”

Shri Mataji : ” These are also auspicious . What  I mean is  that nothing is wrong in worshipping them because these are auspicious too. How can the stones around the Swayambhu be unholy ?”

Sahaj Yogi : “Right.”

Shri Mataji : “These are also holy. But they may not be worshipped as such. (Shri Mataji looking down at main Swayambhu ) but these are really rising from within. There is no doubt about this, These three at the bottom.”

Sahaj Yogi : ” Did you get the plan? Did you get it ?”

Sahaji : ” Yes , it has come”

Sahaj Yogi : ” Where is it?”

All Sahaj Yogis  - Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai. Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai.,

( Shri Mataji performs pujan of the foundation stone. Sahj Yogis clap)

Shri Mataji – This is good. It is very huge. This is Maharashtra’s pride. All deities are established here. Unbelievable. Isn’t  it?. Miracle of the miracles.”

Yogi replies “ Mhasobaa”. Shri Mataji asks “then Mhasobaa is what?” yogi replies “. Native deaity it is Name of Him is “Mhasobaa”. Shri Mataji says “Native daitey Mhasobaa – Ekadasharudra. Ekaadasharudra. Mhasobaa means Ekadasharudra.Little bit Mhasobaa is not so easy to understand. So it is even much better to say Ekaadashrudra, or else Sahasrara it is. Means all seven deties are there. but All of them are pleased (Prasanna). But ekadasharudra means distracting power of Trigunaatmika’s 11(powers). What ever name may be given still What is the essence of it?

What is it- 3( Powers)are with in us isn’t ? yogi says ‘Yes’. Then Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasarswati. With in those (Mother is Pointing towards Swayambhu) She is middle one Mahaalakshmi and She is Mahakali and She is Mahasaraswati. In this way this is created. ( Pointing towards the Stone) And these are all their chakras shown here. Very beautiful it is. (yogis are asking whether the surrounding area is also auspicious and whether to worship the stones which are further down there?, so Mother is answering,) Those are also auspicious stones. What I have to mention is worshiping those (further down stones) is not bad. As they are also auspicious as well. As thoes stones are also within this area. How come they can be inauspicious?. They are also auspicious. But they may not be worshipped as such.( Shri Mataji Looking down at Main Swayambhus) – but this is real absolute appears here. There is no doubt at all which these 3 are here. Yogis adore mother by saying, “ Jagnmata Shri Mataji Nirmala devi ki Jai (2) Universal mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Victory to You. (2)
