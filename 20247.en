After Sahasrar it’s so beatuful 1 it’s Trigunatmika here.Beautiful!see 1,2,3 Can you see Trigunatmika. This is agya here. Beautiful When I say that it is even more. (while worshiping main Swayambhy Herself, Mother saying to yogis nearby as a part of worship) “break the coconut etc. here.

The things which saints and holy people says nobody else is able to say so. Now these are the holy and saintly people are here to tell you everything.

Shri mataji asking native yogis around area. By What name you are going to call for this? Temple? Because it is complet sahasrara, all the seven deaties are here” .Yogis says- ‘well now since ancent time it is named as a “Mhasobaa”.

Shri mataji asks “What?” Yogi replies “ Mhasobaa”. Shri Mataji asks “then Mhasobaa is what?” yogi replies “. Native deaity it is Name of Him is “Mhasobaa”. Shri Mataji says “Native daitey Mhasobaa – Ekadasharudra. Ekaadasharudra. Mhasobaa means Ekadasharudra.Little bit Mhasobaa is not so easy to understand. So it is even much better to say Ekaadashrudra, or else Sahasrara it is. Means all seven deties are there. but All of them are pleased (Prasanna). But ekadasharudra means distracting power of Trigunaatmika’s 11(powers). What ever name may be given still What is the essence of it?

What is it- 3( Powers)are with in us isn’t ? yogi says ‘Yes’. Then Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasarswati. With in those (Mother is Pointing towards Swayambhu) She is middle one Mahaalakshmi and She is Mahakali and She is Mahasaraswati. In this way this is created. ( Pointing towards the Stone) And these are all their chakras shown here. Very beautiful it is. (yogis are asking whether the surrounding area is also auspicious and whether to worship the stones which are further down there?, so Mother is answering,) Those are also auspicious stones. What I have to mention is worshiping those (further down stones) is not bad. As they are also auspicious as well. As thoes stones are also within this area. How come they can be inauspicious?. They are also auspicious. But they may not be worshipped as such.( Shri Mataji Looking down at Main Swayambhus) – but this is real absolute appears here. There is no doubt at all which these 3 are here. Yogis adore mother by saying, “ Jagnmata Shri Mataji Nirmala devi ki Jai (2) Universal mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Victory to You. (2)
