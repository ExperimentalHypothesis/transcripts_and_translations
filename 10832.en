Sung by the late Dr.Arun Apte and his wife. This is during the occasion of Sahaj marriages at Christmas Puja 2008 in Pune, India, blessed by the physical presence of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. ... Uncle Nalgirkar sang along too and sometimes his voice is louder than Dr. Arun Apte. Video not too clear as I shot with my handphone.
