Seeking and Evolution, God's Desire, Dollis Hill Seminar, UK. 1 May 1979.

The question is what happens actually, after Self realization to us. Of course, I mean, you feel thoughtlessly aware; you feel collective consciousness; you can feel the kundalini of others; you can raise the kundalini; you can feel the chakras. This is all you know. But actually what happens in a deeper way to a human being has to be seen. So first of all, let us know what are we as human beings before realization; so we will know what happens to us after realization. Now this subject is very subtle and I would like you to listen to it very, in a very, very great concentration. Today I am not going to talk about abstract things but absolutely about something that is very much matter of fact.

A human being is created out of evolution. You know that very well; that he is created out of evolution. Now there is a big controversy going on.  They don't understand; that's why there is a controversy. But he is developed in seven stages. And that is why it is said that seven days it took to create this world. We can say the whole universe took about seven stages. But as you understand, the seed has got all microscopic things in there to manifest all the parts of the seed. In the same way human beings were created. And as the seed is again recreated in the flower or in the fruit and then again manifests itself in the same manner as the basic tree had done. In the same way you can say that every human being also has all these seeds in him. So let us go to the very beginning of the tree, absolutely to the very beginning.  

Of course, I have told you about how, firstly, the separation between the power of God and God himself took place. But then after that when the power which was basically one power giving rise to three powers. One power can give rise to three powers. For example, electricity is one power but it can become two; it can become magnetical; it can become chemical.  In the same way, one power of God of divine love can give rise to three powers and these three powers moved in an elliptical way. This much I had told you in the mind creation lecture. But today because you are so close and very few so we can chat on this subject very well. Now these three powers we can say like these three powers, this one first, second and third or you say this one on the left hand side, this one in the middle and this one on the right hand side. 

These three powers started moving in an ellipse-like way. Now the central point say is the God and these are his three powers. But above one line you can say but three of them together moving like that. And back to that point and again like that. They can move in 360 degrees and to them also different directions. But by this movement only they created the space and also the time that took them to start from one point and reach another point and the space was in between. So individual movement, every individual movement created a space and time. This movement when it came down like this it went round and round at a point. One on top of another like a spiral coming up you can say. And then it again moves back. When this movement had only taken place this round thing that was formed or circular thing now has three powers. One in the centre, one on the crust and third one around it you can say. These three powers in the Sanskrit language are called as Mahakali, Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati. There is no word for these in English language. That doesn't mean we discard all scientific words but there are no words like that. 

These three powers, out of which the one that was Mahasaraswati, is the one that had five elements. One power had five elements. The second one is the Mahalaxmi was the one that was driving the gene energy of evolutionary power; so this was the evolution. The third one was the desire power was the Mahakali. Now these when they move in a circular way like that, the outer crust as you have seen, is formed by the Mahasaraswati power. These are the five elements. When this circular movement became very dense, then the whole thing sort of solidified. I mean in English language only you can say solidified.  There's no words for sort of expressions otherwise. But we can say solidified. And when it solidified it cracked but it had all these three powers.

You can imagine; we cannot understand. We can understand the five elements because they are scientific but we cannot understand the power of evolution. But it is there; you see the problem is from where does it come? And we cannot understand the power of desire; it is there. Though we don't believe in it; we can't believe in a power which has got these three acts. But it is there; it exists. But we do not want to accept it because you see to the gross eyes you cannot see. You cannot see the desire of a person. So will you say that person has no desire? These three powers exist. And with the practice of that round big thing which is called as 'the big bang' as you have seen on the TV. That is already written in science book that it is called as the big bang. Actually I did not know that they have already discovered this far. So and that is how the big bang was created. And these again started, these fragments started going round and round. And by their movement you see their angularities were cut out and they became round balls. But still they had these three powers in them. With the first power, which had the elements, but those elements had worked out. You can say manifested in the human being as the body of your centers or chakras.  

The material body of your centers comes from these five elements that have come from the Mahasaraswati power. Now these elements in the same proportions have created certain stars. That's why because these stars have the same kind of proportions and we too have the same elements with in us in that proportion we say that stars act on human beings. We need not go into that; that is not important. For evolution that is not important. Our main interest is evolution. Our main interest is to evolve into a superhuman being. So the second power is the evolutionary power and it works through out. It works in the matter. First, the matter is, just you can say, the lava you can call it or the heat and shifted gas, which are formed, which have these three powers. Then when these consolidate, then these three powers coordinate, cooperate and work it out. So the desiring power is inside them, which desires, which controls the desire of God. It is God who desires that these things should happen and then it works.
Now for scientists to believe is impossible. But scientists must know even if they desire, they cannot change the quality of matter. If carbon has got four valences it will have four valences. If you put hydrochloric acid into say sodium solution sodium hydroxide, you will get a particular type of reaction you cannot change. But for God, it is his desire that created this universe. And through His desire He created all these elements that you know of. The carbon was created; it is all evolutionary power. From desire it leads to evolutionary power and the evolutionary power then works it out on these elements and then the elements get divided and get into their different manifestation of these elements. Now, when this happens, gradually the same desire power works through the evolutionary power by giving different religions different power. Now there is no word for dharma. Actually we were trying to find out, you see, can we find out a word they said then; decorum but what is a decorum to matter?  It's nothing. I was just thinking about it. I mean, the matter doesn't have anything about decorum. But he says the original word decorum means the inner understanding. So the inner understanding is the desire of God, to understand the desire of God and to manifest it through your own being.

But up to the human stage it is done, just done the other way round. That (in?) human beings can desire, actually, they can ask for things. In the same way animals can ask for things but their desires are fulfilled by God 'till a certain stage of evolution. I'll tell you how.  Because God created say the carbon, carbon never desired. All right? God wanted to create the carbon; so he created it. He never desired actually; he never thought of it, never. But from carbon to make other things and elements other elements say. It was not desired by matter at all. So at the time of matter, the desire power was dormant. God's desire power acted. But carbon was not conscious of it, neither the carbon nor God. It's a simple thing.  

Second point is to the animal stage, which was also organized by God. I mean, from matter to human beings it has not come by our desire or by our behavior at all. It was God who desired; so He created animals out of elements. When animals were created, I mean the life as you can say, when life was created and when life came into being, the desires started manifesting themselves. For example, an Amoeba desires to eat. But the desire comes to me, amoeba fulfills it in the sense that when it feels something, it goes and eats. He desires and you ask for it. Still the evolutionary power is not evident anywhere, only the desire power. So first, only the matter is there, evident, then the desire power comes in, 'till they come to the human stage. 'Till the human stage, the monkeys never wanted to be human beings. I don't know; if you consult them, then they'll say 'Oh God please save us from that nonsense; we are happy'. Because to be human beings was not asked by them neither they had any idea as to what it was like. So up to this point, this evolutionary power never filled anybody. 

But when you came to the human stage only and also at the very evolved stage of these modern times of Kali Yuga, at this time we can say, of course, this desire existed since human beings were on this earth, to know the desire. This desire was not existing before the human stage. We never cared for the beyond. But it's only the human beings you know how the ego superego developed and how they become separated, cessated from the main course and how they want to be. Now to make somebody think about the beyond; how do you do it?  First, you create an atmosphere by making him feel that he is imprisoned. A bird who has got all the sky to fly out doesn't bother about the sky but put him in the cage, then you start seeking out the divine in the same way a human being. I mean this may sound very ugly and very cruel but it is not that. What I am trying to say, the shelling of man is played because his ego and superego developed because he raised his head in his evolutionary process. And when these two meet then this I-ness, this separateness, this bondage- human bondage. Now the desire came to go beyond. Now for the first time the evolutionary process has started working itself through. This desire to go beyond the evolutionary process started working in human beings. It started moving this side, that side working out that little bit of this. In the search so many sorts of ideologies so many sorts of isms started, yogas developed.

There is no end to it, to go to God. But it is to be understood that everything has been done by this desire. If you could just know that 'Thy will be done' is the theme of evolution; if you could feel that from your heart you are Sahaja; that's what it is. You see the very difficult thing for human beings especially in places where people have done 'Oh I have done this'. You see their statues are erected with their swords behind. What have you done? Didn't do anything - created problems? What have you achieved? Have you achieved joy for anything? Have you achieved evolutionary ascent for anyone? What have you created with all this beauty around? They all have all been together- everything all human.....Have you been able to break that bondage? Simple question: No. But to accept 'Thy will be done' is the most difficult thing for human beings and that is why to be Sahaja is a difficult thing. 

If I tell you 'You Stand on your head' you will do it. Isn't it? If I tell you even take out your intestines' you will try, since your Guru has told. If I tell you that you come and see me; they will say no better to go to India and see Mataji there than here because, you see some effort should be there something should be done. (?) Freely you just go there and Mataji will give you realization. It's beyond, beyond is empowers (all these powers?). Because you see so that's the part where I become myself, because so far I've done everything by myself, how is it possible? That's the first doubt that comes in.

But this evolutionary power has to be sought, has to be asked for. And this is why human beings are living on this earth. If not today, tomorrow all of them will have to come to this. Otherwise all kinds of problems: physical problems, say cancer; cancer cannot be cured unless and until you get this, cannot. You try. You may go on removing the nose, the eyes, the ears. It will spread. It cannot be cured. You have to jump into that beyond state otherwise you cannot be cured. Even with religion, people keep in the bondage and follow the religion. You cannot. If you are under the bondage, you are not following any religion but your own ideas, your own concepts. You are not following the will of God. Once you become that, then your will becomes the will of God. So what happens that through your being the vibrations start coming. The parasympathetic nervous system, which is within a human being, is the desire of god carried out. So then this desire of god starts flowing; integration takes place; a complete and the manifestation of the evolutionary power takes place in the sense that desire is put on the elements.

For example we had a lady here and her husband was a drunk, a great drunk. And she couldn't come and see me because her husband was a drunk. And she said Mother what should I do?  I have to do something about my husband. I said, "Let it be; use some limes.  Because limes are very good receptors of vibrations, you can try".  It sounds funny but they are. What can I do about it?  If the limes are like that, I have to use the limes. If any other thing is like that, I have to use that. But limes are the best. So I said, "All right bring some limes". So I vibrated the limes. I gave it to her; I said, "You put them under the pillow for seven days". And the gentleman was cured. Now what did I do? Nothing, I didn't even think about it to be very frank. I just put these vibrations, which are the desire of God, into those limes. When the limes were put there the desire power of my desire power, which is the will of God, started acting. And they convinced the people who were inside him the entities might have been inside him. Or they might have convinced his mind also or his desire power they must have somehow or other managed. That his desire power was brought to such a level, that he didn't feel like drinking any more and he was all right. 

Today you'll find one boy who will be coming here, an Indian boy. You have seen that little boy who comes to me. And from his childhood you see they didn't know what had happened to him. When he grew up a little they found he was extremely restless and he would not sit at home and he could not even speak either. He used to run about and cry and weep. And all the time they had to, I mean, really chain him just like a dog. And no doctors could help; they went to all kinds of things to make it worse spiritually, horrible things that you can do to a child. I mean it's absolutely anti godly, anti-godly. So nothing could happen. Then somebody told them about me, they said. And I just didn't think. And with a lime, the child is now sitting all right. And today she says, told me on the phone, that he's understanding everything very well. He understands that it is decent to sit properly and he now doesn't misbehave. When he goes to other places, he sits all right and he's all right and he's started speaking few words. Now I didn't do anything you see. Perhaps I touched that boy only once. 

The vibrations that you know of as divine vibrations are the desire of your spirit; the existence itself is a desire.  Existence itself is on the desire. The moment the desire finishes, the existence finishes. That's why it is such an important thing to human beings to exist. They'll try anything to exist because that is the love. Once the desire finishes off to exist, then that's the finish of a human being.  As long as we call it that the desire is in the heart; as soon as the heart stops we are dead. Now this desire we have. We have desire to have a house. Everybody wants to live in Buckingham palace. All right? We want this matter; we want that matter; we become that. But this is not the desire of God. This is our own desire and there's a bondage. When we are under the bondage, this is our desire. We are....even Sahaja Yoga sometimes people ask me 'what about my marriage will it come through? Will it be there?' Now if it has to come through if it has to be all right, then God will work it out not you. 

It's very subtle and difficult for people to understand. Then what Krishna had said one can understand that karma deva [ shloka in Sanskrit]. We have to do what we want to do.  Karma we can do but the truth of that, leave it to God. Because he knows the desire of God has to work. The desire of God is to be accepted and he has to work. But that is not possible by giving a lecture to you by giving you a brainwash 'all right leave it to God!' God can be pope, God can be some cardinal, or God can be somebody in India, some sort of a priest who's selling lies. I mean anybody can that way be a god. That's not the point. The God in you, if He is desiring, then He does what ever is best for you. So after realization, what happens that your desires get vibrated. Your desire, the priorities, start changing the importance starts changing because through you the desire of God starts working. It is very interesting. 

Today only when somebody told me that people go to Germany and would always go and have some wine. Because wine was tradition of national wine (?) and this time was wine festival or something. But after realization very expensive wine he thought lets try, he bought it. He took two, three sips and he just couldn't take it; he didn't like it; he threw it away. But I didn't say that that you just don't drink. But it's the God in you creates this feeling. And you feel his desire.  Your desire becomes one with Him and that's how you start discarding. And this is the basic thing that happens and that's how your priorities change.

There was a lady who was a very efficient housewife. And she knew how many clothes she had and how many her husband had and how many children she had and what was the phone number of xyz and of the police and this and that and everything she knew by heart. Absolutely efficient, extremely meticulous and everything polished and everything in her house. But if you went to her house despite all her efficiency you feel like running away by the back door straight off. No warmth no love; I mean you feel where to sit. I mean who would like? It's so meticulous, you wouldn't feel relaxed any where to sit because the lady was so particular about everything. So, she gets realization. And then what happens? Her priorities change. She came and complained to me, 'Mother I am forgetting most of my numbers; I am forgetting how to cook; I don't know where are my things". I said, "Really"? (Thank God?). But one thing nice has happened to me.  I said, "What is nice happened"? She said, "I have actually done better. I am looking much better.  People don't run away from me; things have worked out". I said, "How"?  She said, "I don't know.  Somehow or other I have got the idea of now of timings and not of time". How do you get difference between time and timings? You have to see the time. And the timing is, you know, what time today only.  
We were coming down and I said let's get the taxi; so we went to get the taxi. We arrived there after I don't know how many minutes because I never see my watch; it is always out of order. I told them lets go down the taxi stand and I was there in ten minutes just perfectly. We didn't even press the bell and we were there. You see you get the time; it's so fantastic that people can't believe how it works. But what happens, that's the Gods time. He organizes things in such a way which we call the unconscious. The unconscious becomes conscious within. What is unconscious is the desire of God. The desire of God becomes, in us, conscious and it starts guiding us all the time. And the guiding, if we leave it with the guiding, it guides us through and through and through. I mean a simple thing like a taxi, I mean doesn't matter, even if we have to walk it makes no difference but I'm saying even that part was looked after.

So why don't you sit down nicely just do what you feel like and it's there. It happens you see because you say we leave it at Your feet oh Lord.  What does that mean? With a single movement he can create this universe. Really, we can believe. He has done it. You have not done it; we cannot even create a little atom. So when we surrender ourselves after realization, before realization nothing has meaning. No, after realization when we say we surrender ourselves to you Oh Lord. Oh, He has telecommunication with me, He has a dynamic force. So you'll be surprised that it is the power, which has the desire of god in every particle.

Now can you think of a matter which has got evolutionary power, vibrations, and which has got the desire power? Every particle has that. But when that light is lighted in you, whenever you touch anything, you get it. That thing whether it is matter, whether it's an animal or weather it is a human being gets touched by it and changes. Only thing is that the human beings are aware of it and others are not. So today somebody came in and he had a bandage.  I said, "All right, take my shawl rub it on it". Finished, he's cured. You see it happens, if you call it a miracle. But so many other miracles are taken for granted. Look at our eyes. 

So the basic thing that happens to you is that your desire power becomes one with God and that everywhere were ever is the desire power of God, which is no place because that is the last thing and the first thing. It was the first which started manifesting and it is the last where we are going to end up. So it is the first and the last. All those spots and there is no place where these spots are not there. They used to say you are everywhere there is no place where we do not exist gets lighted up. And what? Only in the game of our dear brethren the human kind. That they can deny the great freedom of human beings to be stupid, (?), to be foolish, to be arrogant, to be egoistical, to be blind under the name of scientific, under the name of rationality all kinds of things people do and reach no where. But as you see human beings have freedom to be stupid, foolish, to be superficial, to be prejudicial and somehow they have accepted that kind. That's why to get people on the Sahaja is a difficult thing.

Moreover the desire of God thinks, understands, organizes and loves but it doesn't pamper you. It loves you but it doesn't pamper you. If you are really simple, then only it dawns upon you. Otherwise it does not. It is very subtle; it is a very subtle power. It happens to those who really desire it, that their desire should become one with god only; such people get realization. So in the democratic way you cannot address Sahaja yoga. No, you cannot. Because democratic way you can say that, how many people there are coming to Sahaja Yoga. The less they come the better it is. That shows because most of them you see are superficial people. But the more they come; it only means that there are more people who have become like that. They want to become right; they want to improve their lives; they want to change their lives. They are truly seekers because this is not a superficial stuff, which normally people take sixty percent. And at least thirty percent more are the people who want to take something in, which they can play some role.  So ninety are correct because they must play some role.

I mean even if I tell you, you pull your hair like that. You see there is a community in India, in which I mean, India has all kinds of people. But this one is special. They are called as pitambars of the Jain community. They don't wear any dress see? Nothing. They are absolutely they don't even wear bikinis absolutely they live without anything. Very embarrassing you know. Actually it so happened to us that my husband worked when I was very young he was the collector of a district. And we were invited to a function by these pitambar Jains. 'Till then I didn't know that they did like this all through I thought that at least when they meet others they dress up. But no, they made the collector and his wife sit in the front with all the honors and all the people. There were three thousand people. And these pitambaras were sitting on a platform which was about four feet high. Imagine the embarrassment and I didn't know where to look, you know. And they go on slapping their body and all that and it was most embarrassing, so ugly.  But, even that they are willing to do because they thought by that they become Pitambars, which means they become great saints you know.  So they need to do that ugliness and that horrible shamelessness.

But apart from that, the worst part was that they were always pulling their hair. They didn't know why they were all the time pulling their hair and this thing. The other thing is that they are not supposed to go to any barber and they are not supposed to have any hair on their body.  So they are all the time pulling their hair. They have sort of become an autism. It's a fact I tell you. And there must be at least Five, Six thousands like that in India.  Who are doing this nonsense you know. They walk on the street and under law nobody charges them for nudity. Otherwise, in India it is not allowed to be nude on the road. You see you are charged for that. But these people we have too, you see. Because in the law, they say this is our religion we cannot suffer from these idiotic (rulings?) So imagine there are thousands of people who are doing this kind of a nonsense just in the name of religion. And they are very superior; they don't look at anyone. We have sacrificed our shame, our rationality but greatest of all our wisdom we have sacrificed in the name of God. And that we are going to sit on the right hand side of God when we enter into the kingdom of Heaven. This is one extreme case I am telling because when I describe these people understand absolutely the extremes to which we go; we have a conceptualization of reality and (of the realization?).

So to be there one has to know that the greatest mantra is 'Thy will be done'. Little bit of relaxation of your mister capital letter E capital letter G and capital letter O. If it could be little bit given leave for a while things work out. Because that is the instrument that was used so far to express yourself but to express god, better give up that thing. But then once it happens, after realization you overpower all the elements.  What are these elements after all?  They are nothing but the dust of the sea. Only the human beings have put them on His head and given them the freedom to choose. And that's why I have to beg of you to take to your wisdom, to surrender to your wisdom and give up your ego for a little while. Then let it touch the Kundalini, has touched wisdom. It is all built in; it is all in you; it is going to work out and it works out; it has worked with many and it should work with you.

But it is an individual question. It is a question of the individual as far as ego is concerned. But it is also a collective force. Like men in China, you see. For example, it works much more in India because they have much more chance to work it out. You see these are the hands. God uses Sahaja Yogis as his hands to work it out. You must have heard of the goddess who has got one thousand hands. She has these powers behind her and they are the hands and she uses different powers because she has to do a complicated work. Somebody has to pluck your hair; somebody has to pluck your nose; somebody has to pluck your eyes. Trouble is, you are so much stuck up with everything, somebody proud.  Even I have seen people are proud of their tongue, which you can put in the mouth. So, these things are to be taken away, once you release your ego and all these powers are worked out [?].  Naturally the instrument changed; the ego instrument changed. So the priorities changed. But what worked out as a result, the bliss, the joy. All the promise [?]

If you have it, master it and use it.  That's the way it has to be. But I have seen people come from Sahaja Yoga who get realized they telephone to me; we are very nice Mother; we are feeling very nice.  I said, "At home you have to meditate because it is a very deeper way of cleansing".  And who is going to cleanse you?  I am the wash up woman.  I have to do the job.  So better come to the laundry. That's the point and work it out.  And once you are established, you'll be amazed at yourself. Even with the movement of your hands you can raise the kundalini. You can, simple. You can give realization. Just try; because your desire merges into the desire of God. Before ego orientation before ego working, the worst thing that has happened to human beings, attention is disturbed, is spread out.  His attention is not concentrated. Ego orientation is brought about because of disturbed attention. We cannot keep our eyes at one point. Either we look at others or we want others to look at us. All our attention goes about; we cannot look at ourselves, neither at anyone.
