Mahashivaratri Puja. Sydney (Australia), 3 March 1996.

&nbsp;

Today we are going to do puja to Shiva, Shri Shiva. As you know, Shri Shiva is the reflection of Sadashiva within us.

&nbsp;

I've already told about the reflection. Sadashiva is the God Almighty, the one who sees the play of Adi Shakti. But He is the Father who is watching each one of His Creation or Her Creation.

&nbsp;

His support to Adi Shakti is entirely, fully strengthening. There's no doubt in His mind about the capability of the Adi Shakti. But when He finds that in the play of Adi Shakti, the people or the world as such, try to disturb Her, or to spoil Her work, then He gets into His wrathful mood, and He destroys all such people, and maybe, He destroys the whole world.

&nbsp;

On one side He’s wrathful, no doubt, on the other side, He is the ocean of compassion and joy. That's why, when He is reflected within us, we get our Self-realisation, we get the light of our Spirit and we get into the ocean of joy.

&nbsp;

Also He is the ocean of knowledge, so those who get Self-realised get the knowledge of the Divine, which is very subtle, permeating into every atom and molecule, the power of this knowledge is there.

&nbsp;

His style is such that, in his compassion, He forgives even very cruel rakshasas, if they dedicate themselves to Him. Because His compassion has no limits and sometimes the same people who are blessed by Him try to trouble the devotees of Adi Shakti - but it is just to create a drama, an event. Unless and until there is some drama, people won't understand. We had to have Ramayana, we had to have Mahabharata, we had to have Christ being crucified, we had to have Mohammed being tortured. All that drama was there because without events, people don't remember.

&nbsp;

So in the spiritual life of human beings, they have seen lots of dramas between the blessings of Shiva and the powers of the Adi Shakti. As the time has moved, today in the history of spirituality a great discovery has been made, that people can get their realisation in the collective, en-masse. Thousands can get their realisation.

&nbsp;

Now, we should know what is that realisation we have got, what does that mean and what is the culminating point.

&nbsp;

First of all, I have to tell you, the mind about which we speak and depend upon is a myth. There's nothing like mind. Brain is reality, not the mind. Mind is created by us reacting to outside, either we react to conditionings or ego. Thus this mind is created like bubbles in the ocean of reality, but that's not reality.

&nbsp;

This mind, whatever we decide, we know, is very limited, illusive and sometimes shocking. The mind always move in a linear direction, and because there’s no reality in it, it recoils, and boomerangs. Thus all the enterprises, all the projections so far we have done, it seems, come back to us. Whatever they discover, comes back to us as a big destructive power or a very big shock.

&nbsp;

So one has to decide what to do, how to be out of this track of our mind. Kundalini is the solution. When She’s awakened, She takes you, with that awakening, She takes you beyond your mind. The first thing is to go beyond your mind. With mind, you'll do many things, but it will not be satisfying, it will be not a solution, it will not help you. And when we start depending too much on our mind we develop all kinds of physical, mental, emotional problem. Now the latest is the stress, and this stress has no solution they say, but in Sahaja Yoga, we find the solution, by crossing over this mind. It's like a barrier for our advancement.

&nbsp;

So when you get your realisation, you must understand that your Kundalini has taken your attention beyond the mind. Now, this reaction to outside has come because we human beings have a prism-like brain, or we can say a prism-like skull, and when the energy passes into it, I've explained it in My books, it goes into bifurcations, or you can say refractions, by which our attention goes out, and we react.

&nbsp;

If we react too much, then these bubbles create a very horrible mind which can lead to any kind of thing. It justifies itself, it pampers your ego. The ego and the conditioning that creates this mind start using this mind for the purpose of their fulfilment, of their, all the accumulation of ideas and thoughts which has no backing, which has no reality with it.

&nbsp;

It's like we make the computer [and] ultimately we become slaves of the computer, we make the watches ourselves, and then we become slaves of the watches. That's how it dominates human beings. And when a person who has a very strong mind decides to destroy, like Hitler did, with some idea, he can go on destroying which has a very far fetched effect on our culture, on our spirituality.

&nbsp;

Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly aware - where you cross your mind, you go above your mind, mind cannot affect you. This is the first stage as we call, is thoughtless awareness.

&nbsp;

Second one is where you start seeing the working of this Paramchaitanya, of this All-pervading Power. And you start becoming aware that there is lot of truth in what Mataji says. That there is this Power that works out many things. It works miraculously so many things for you. It gives you blessings, It guides you, It helps you in so many ways It helps you. It gives you good health, good wealth, and also a very good society of very beautiful people in the collective. All that you can see clearly is happening here.

&nbsp;

Now this happening of achieving thoughtless awareness is very simple and easy, but to maintain at that point is difficult. We still react and we think. Anything you see, you react. To get to that point in thoughtless awareness is first to change your attention.

&nbsp;

Now, for example, once we were climbing a very high mountain to see one temple called Palitana - Myself, My son-in-law and My daughter. And we were really tired because we had to climb, I don't know how many steps and when we went up we were tired and there was a little canopy made of beautiful marble carving, so we just lay down there ourselves. They were very tired and they said : "What is this kind of a temple!" They were grudging. While I looked up and I saw lots of beautiful elephants were carved. So I told My son-in-law, "Look at these elephants, they all have tails of different types." He said "Mummy, we are all dying, how can you see the tails of elephants?" But is just to divert their attention from that tiredness [that] I told them that - why not see the tails of the elephant, which is very different.

&nbsp;

So what happens [is] that, when you are putting your attention so much to outside all the time, then you must first of all also divert your attention. For example, you see these beautifully made things here. Your attention is something else - just try to enjoy the beauty of that. You see. there are beautiful carpets here - just look at them without thinking, because they don't belong to you, so no headache, they belong to somebody else, is very good! Otherwise, if it belongs to you you start thinking ; "Oh, My God, I have spread them here, what will happen, they have to be insured!” Or some sort of a thing like that. That's common human reaction. But if it doesn't belong to you, you can watch it nicely. Now you watch it and don't think. You'll be amazed, when you see the beauty that is put inside this, you'll see the artist who has put his joy, his exuberance into it, and you’ll be amazed, after realisation, that, this exuberance will fill into you and a cool kind of a relaxation will come into you, and this Kundalini will rise, and you'll become steady in your thoughtless awareness.

So whenever you look at anything, look at any beautiful thing, even say, today's election, just watch the man that is elected. Watching him, itself, gives him blessings, gives him better ideas. You get also ideas, which are coming from reality, which are there - how to make this man a successful person, or this country a successful democracy.

&nbsp;

All these things happen when your attention is diverted from criticising, from reacting - just you watch, become the witness, try to witness everything. It's not so very yet practised, so far, I've seen, that, whenever even we get our, achieve our, realisation, we don't realise that we have to witness everything. When you start witnessing through your Spirit, then you don't see the bad points of another, but you see the good points. You just pick up the person with very good points.

&nbsp;

So once you see that, the witness state enlarges, and you start enjoying another person. You start enjoying every thing that is there, even a small blade of grass you can enjoy, if you have that capacity. In Japan, Zen system started on these lines and he made,  Vidhitama was the person who started it, he made a garden out of moss, different moss, you know, very small, small. Then there were little, little flowers also. And hardly about five feet of the garden, which looks like the shape of a question mark you can say. You have to go on a lift, and you reach that platform on top of a hill, or a mountain where you see this. All little, little mosses are there, and you see, differently arranged a beautiful garden. When you start seeing it, your thought stops, because such a marvellous thing, when you put attention to it, to its creation, your thoughts stop.

&nbsp;

So you must practise as to find out what stops your thoughts. What makes you the witness.

Once you develop this habit, you will station yourself nicely in the thoughtless awareness. Then you start watching how Sahaja Yoga has helped you, how it has been blissful, what you have achieved through Sahaja Yoga. You will be amazed, if you just start watching it, everywhere you'll be amazed how this Paramchaitanya acts.

&nbsp;

Nowadays, this Paramchaitanya has become active because of Kruta yuga. You can see from the way it is playing around, with vibrations around Me. You've seen so many photographs of mine where these vibrations are there. Also you've seen the photographs of many sahaja yogis seating before Me, on their heads My name is written down in Arabic language. You've seen so many ways by which you can find out that there is the play of the Divine.

&nbsp;

Now the mind will still try to say some things. Don't listen, just watch. The effect of Sahaja Yoga you should watch on yourself, on your own body. Don't think about it but watch it, and you’ll be amazed how you have changed.

&nbsp;

To be very frank, when I come to Australia every year, sometimes I can't even recognise you. You look much younger, much better, much happier, and I don't recognise who are these people.

&nbsp;

It is this witness state which takes you to another realm which we call as doubtless awareness. At that state, you can become so empowered that you can give realisation to others, you can give complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga, you can talk to them. Also you emit.

&nbsp;

(talks aside in Hindi)

You see, when I'm watching, I'm absorbing the heat, that's My trouble.

&nbsp;

So your whole state, spiritual state, becomes so much blissful, you become so powerful, you become so compassionate and so loving, so balanced, completely cleansed with all the destructive ideas you have, all the depressive ideas you have, and then you really stand up as a great sahaji who can do tremendous work.

&nbsp;

Like recently I heard that Germans and Austrians are now going to Israel, because they think Jews were killed by their forefathers, and there's a big centre now started in Israel. Just imagine! How these people, once [they] reach that state, go to countries single-handed. They have done so much. Same in Turkey, same in places which are very tremendously remote in South Africa. Because, from inside they become completely confident, in thoughtless awareness, as well as doubtlessly aware.

&nbsp;

But now, once you start growing by meditative attention, what happens [is] that your attention becomes enlightened. Now the job is to motivate your attention. It's not just to enjoy, but to motivate it, to put it to problems. Now supposing you have some problem on a national basis - you all can put your attention to that and things will work out. Because you are the channel of this All-pervading Power which is trying to create a new world for you, new human beings. And this evolution can take place very fast if you all decide that whatever we have now within ourselves, we should motivate it, we should direct it and put this attention to some use. It should not be wasted. Whatever wealth we have, it should not be wasted.

&nbsp;

Now the main question today, which I'm going to tell you about - that, what is God's realisation? First is the Self-realisation, and there are many ambitious people who want to become God's realised.

&nbsp;

First and foremost thing, we should know that human beings cannot become God! It’s not the becoming of it. You have not become, also, in a way, Spirit, because the Spirit is emitting through you, using you, giving you, looking after you. If you become the Spirit, there won't be any body left, nothing will be left. So with this body intact, your Spirit is acting through this body, is giving you all the light.

&nbsp;

But one cannot become God Almighty, this one has to understand very clearly. But what is God's realisation is to know about God.  You see, to know about God means to know how His powers are working, how He controls, by becoming part and parcel of God Almighty. Like My finger doesn't know about My brain, but it acts according to My brain. The finger cannot become the brain, but it has to act absolutely according to My brain, because it is so connected, it is so one.

&nbsp;

Here, when you have the God's realisation, then you know about the brain, you know about God, you know about His powers, you know everything about Him. As far as I am concerned it's a difficult task for you, because I'm a Mahamaya. It's very difficult for you to know each and every thing about Me. I am quite a illusive person, as you know that well. And whatever I do or whatever I achieve, it is just for you to see and understand that - after all this is Adi Shakti, and She can do all these things. You can also do all the things, but you cannot become Me.

&nbsp;

But you have to know, to know, through love, through devotion through prayers. To know the God's powers is the way you are God realised. Then you can control the nature, you can control everything, if you have that knowledge within you about God. For that a complete humility is needed, that you cannot become God, cannot become God Almighty, you cannot become the Deities. But definitely, you can become God realised, Means God acts through you, uses you as his power, as His channel, and that you know, that you know, what He’s doing to you, what He’s telling, what His vision is, and what is the information. The connection is like that.

&nbsp;

Many people in Sahaja Yoga have been benefited, I know. But they don't know how they have been benefited, what has worked it out, how it has worked it out, what connection of theirs has helped them. Once you do that, you know that clearly, how things are working out, with what power you have achieved it, then it's a God's realisation.

&nbsp;

Such people become extremely powerful, in the sense that they can control so many things. There have been many saints of that kind, but sometimes they fell from even that and they developed their ego. They didn't have their own humility that they should have, that devotion, that dedication, that surrendering. They fell down you see them, I have seen some of them, that they become quite proud of their achievements, they don't want to leave it to anyone. They think they have achieved it with great difficulties and why should they give it to others. Such people are not going to rise very higher. But you people who have got your realisation, and who are humble, who know that out of humility only you are going to achieve your surrendering.

&nbsp;

Islam means surrender. Mohammed Sahib has talked about ‘Islam’, meaning ‘You surrender’.

&nbsp;

If you cannot surrender, you can never know God. He's clearly said that unless and until you know yourself, you will not know about God.

&nbsp;

So as sahajis, you have to know all the little, little things, all the big things, and all the great visions, that you can do it because of the grace of God, because [of] His blessings, because of His love for you, that you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

&nbsp;

I may say you have entered, I may say you have achieved that state, I may say that, but, still you are not there. It's like if I tell somebody - "Now you are in Australia." He's not in Australia, but I can say : " You are in Australia" So he believes " I'm in Australia". That's not the way. You have to be in Australia, then you have to know about Australia. You have to know what sort of a climate it is, what sort of things it is.

&nbsp;

I find also the parents here have to talk to their children. There's not much rapport of the parents with the children. They are being properly looked after in the school, and they want to do a lot, but the parents also must get involved, when the children come here, to see that they develop proper discipline, proper sense. Not to get attached to them to ruin them. If you get attached, then you'll ruin them.

&nbsp;

One of the qualities of Shiva is complete detachment, and that is what you have to develop, is to become completely detached.

&nbsp;

Detachment doesn’t mean that you neglect anything.

&nbsp;

I've explained to you many a time that like the sap in the tree rises, goes to different, various places and then evaporates or it goes back to Mother Earth - in the same way your detachment should be. If you get attached because it’s your son, or if you get attached because he’s Australian, or maybe he belongs to certain family or certain class, then you are still limited.

&nbsp;

All these limitations have to be dropped if you have to cross over, and these limitations create such a big load that whatever I may try, whatever you may try, you cannot stay in thoughtless awareness. That's a very beautiful state in which all of you should be there. In that you are not dominating nor you are compromising you stand on your own legs and you know for definite that you are not swayed away by any idea or any domination or any subjection of yours by anyone.

&nbsp;

So you become completely a free bird, absolutely free bird and then it becomes your job to achieve your flight.

&nbsp;

One flight is up to the thoughtless awareness, the second one is up to the doubtless awareness, and the third one is to God's realisation.

&nbsp;

I have seen people who are very close to Me also don't understand. They behave in such a manner as if now they have become Gods. So egoistical they are that I'm amazed at them - then they have to leave Sahaja Yoga.

&nbsp;

So, you see, even if I praise you too much, if I say anything to you, you shouldn't get pampered. It's a testing ground. Or otherwise, also, if I tell you that, “This is not good, you should improve on this,” you shouldn't mind, because I have to do it, it's My job, and your job is to listen to Me, because I've nothing to gain from you, I do not ask for anything.

&nbsp;

What I want is you should all get My powers. You may not become what I am, I agree, but please try to get all the powers that I have, which is not a difficult thing.

&nbsp;

This is what is God's realisation, that's what,Ois to know Shiva and Sadashiva. Through the Shiva, you know Sadashiva. You see the reflection, and from the reflection, you know who is the Original, from the reflection you learn.

&nbsp;

Thus you reach that state where you think you are now definitely settled in the Kingdom of God, and that you can see God, you can feel God, you can understand God, and you can love God.

May God bless you
