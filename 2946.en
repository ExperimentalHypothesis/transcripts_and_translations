Advices. Bombay (India), 27 May 1976.

I told you, in Sahaja Yoga, how you go into the state of thoughtless awareness. After the unison with the Spirit (Tadatmya) one can attain the stage of vicinity with God (Samipya) and the God realization (Salokya). But on achieving the unity with the Spirit, a person's interest itself changes.

Just by achieving the state of unison with the Spirit, with it's experience, a person does not wish to go into the state of Salokya and Samipya. That means, when vibrations start flowing into your hands and when you feel other's Kundalini and can raise other's Kunda­lini, your chitta (attention) goes towards watching other's Kundalini and understanding your own. You want to be alert about your chakras and understand other's chakras.

If you look at the sky, you may see - even though there are clouds - you will see many types of Kundalini. Because, now that your attention has gone to Kundalini, whatever you want to know about Kundalini, whatever you want to see, whatever desires you have, these will be revealed to you. Your interest in Kundalini grows and all other interests are lost.

Try to understand thus : As you enter youth, leaving behind the childhood, you have the interests of young age i.e. your service, business, family etc; you take interest only in these and all other childhood interests drop off, old experiences fade away and your attention goes towards new ex­periences. Or try to understand this way: Say, a person is not interested in music, and somehow he has become interested - he is interested in classical music - then he is not going to enjoy any other music, let there be any concert of non-classical music.

Your condition in Sahaja Yoga should also be similar. As regards your ether habits and likings, the fact is that they were gradually and intentionally cultivated and hence those interests are deeply imbibed in you. Sahaja Yoga has brought about a complete trans­formation within you, - you have come into a state of new awareness, you can now feel the vibrations and other's Kundalini, you can give realization to many people, you have cured many people, you have entered into a new power and you are charged with it.

But in doing all this there is only one shortcoming, and that is "you have not made any effort and everything has happened by itself, effortlessly". Perhaps that's the reason why although many people receive vibrations in Sahaja Yoga and also rise to a level, even then their attention never stabilizes on Paramatma, Atma, Kundalini; and repeatedly it goes to wrong things.

You had asked, "What to do after getting the realization". After receiving you must give. It is absolutely necessary to give after receiving, otherwise receiving has no mean­ing. And while giving, one point - only one small point, must be kept in mind, "That the body, the mind (manas), the intellect (buddhi),—that means the 'whole personality' with which you are giving such an incom­parable thing, that itself should be very beautiful; your being should be very clean." There should be no disease in it. If you have any sickness - perhaps there may be some Sahaja yogis having diseases. Before coming to Sahaja Yoga you must be getting worried and wishing that the disease should be somehow cured. But thereafter the attention would not be on the sickness and you would be saying, "It will be alright, does not matter." But it is wrong Whatever may be your problem, even minor, you can cure your­self by placing your hand on that spot, you can keep your physical side very clean.

However, for you I have told you one remedy. As it is said, everyone must go to bathroom and clean oneself after getting up in the morning. Similarly, for Sahaja Yogis, it is extremely necessary to have foot-soaking treatment, at least for five minutes, before going to bed. However highly evolved you may be and you may not be getting caught - but it does not matter. You must

do foot-soaking for at least five minutes. Even I take this treatment sometimes, (although it is not necessary for me) so that my Sahaja Yogis will also take to it. It is a very good habit.

All Sahaja Yogis must do the foot-soaking at least for five minutes. All Sahaja Yogis, should light a lamp before the photograph, apply sindur (vermilion), dip their feet in salted water and sit in this fashion opening out both palms towards the photograph. If you do this, more than half of your problems would be solved automatically. However busy you may be, it is not difficult to spare five minutes. All should sit like this before retiring. That will stop more than half of your catching.

Within ourselves there exist many bad tendencies. There are many dark tendencies only within ourselves, which are called nega­tivities. They try strongly to influence. To be under their control is being under Satan's control. You can become Satan if you want, or you can become God if you want. It is a different thing if you want to become Satan. I am not the Guru for that. I am the Guru if you have to become God. But, you should save yourselves from being the Satan.

First thing to note is that on the night of new-moon and full-moon, always there are dangers on your left and right sides. Specially on these two days, that is, the nights of new moon and full moon, you should sleep early. After your meals, bow before the photograph, meditate, and putting attention in Sahasrara, sleep after getting into the bandhan. That means you go into the unconscious the very moment your attention goes to Sahasrara. There, do yourself the bandhan and you are saved. During these two nights particularly.

The night of new moon, you should medi­tate on Shri Shiva. You should sleep after meditating on Shri Shiva - that is the Spirit - and surrender yourself to Him. On the night of full moon, you should meditate on Shri Rama and surrender yourself to Him for pro­tection. The meaning of the word Ramchandra is "creativity". You should completely dedicate your creative powers to Him. Thus you have to take special care of yourself on these two days.

However on the seventh and ninth days of Lunar fortnights (according to the Indian Calendar "saptami" and "navami") you have my special blessings. Do remember that you are getting specially these blessings from Me on these two days. Make some special arrangements so that you can have good meditation on these days. This is how you should protect yourself. And whenever you are leaving your house give yourself the bandhan; always be in the bandhan.

If you come across someone having a catch on Agya, get into the bandhan, even with attention. Never argue with a person who's caught on Agya; it is a foolishness. Can you ever argue with a bhoot ? Also do not argue with a person who is caught on Vishuddhi. 'Never' approach the person caught on Sahasrara! Have no contact with him. Tell him to improve his Sahasrara first. There should be no objection in telling him, "Your Sahasrara is caught. Put it right." Sahasrara should be kept clean. If anyone has started catching on Sahasrara, that person should immediately request other Sahaja Yogis, "Do something and clear my Sahasrara". If some­one caught on Sahasrara talks to you, you should tell him that he is your enemy. Never talk to him as long as he is caught.

As regards a person caught on Heart, you should help the person having catch on the Heart. As far as possible, put bandhan on his heart, let him put one hand on his heart and take him to the photograph of Shri Mataji. You must be careful about the heart chakra. May be sometimes one may get a problem on the heart chakra. You must clear the heart chakra. But many people have no heart ! They are very dry personalities. And you cannot do anything for such persons even if you wish to. However, if they request you, advise them to leave Hatha Yoga, relieve themselves of the burden of different jobs, and learn to love others; to love at least the pets first, if they cannot love a human being.

You should also love everyone. Love the children. Never be unjust to children. In fact you should not be unjust to anyone. Never harm anyone. Nobody should beat the children. Never raise your hand to beat, never get angry with anyone. Particularly, Sahaja Yogis should never be angry. Without getting anno­yed, they should improve everything tactfully and intelligently. Never get angry.

I have told you all this so that you can keep your own instruments clean. And always keep high ideals. You will rise only if your aims are high and if you want to rise. Never look down. I am with you at every step, at every place. Everywhere. You may go anywhere. At every place I am with you, completely, in person, by mind and in every respect. When­ever you will remember me I will be by your side with all my powers. It is my promise. Those who want to go to hell, I am pulling them down. Hence be careful and look upwards.
