It is My immense joy to see all of you here from various parts of this world.
Ritambhara Pragnya – part I. Seminar of Lodge Hill (UK), 23 July 1983.

When your heart is so full, the words are too poor to carry the intensity. I wish you could understand that intensity through your heart.

It's all been arranged, I think, by the Divine, that we should meet here all of us in such a wonderful surrounding, in the Nature. That something great should happen to all of us. That we should achieve really something great this time. Now as the time is short, I will tell you first of all a few things about meditation now, then we'll have two more talks, I hope so.

Meditation is a very general word. It is not a word that explains all the three steps one has to take for meditating. But in Sanskrit language they have very clearly said, how you have to move in your meditation.

First is called as Dhyaana, and second is called as Dhaarana, and the third is called as Samadhi.

Luckily Sahaja Yoga is a, such a thing that you get everything in a bundle. You avoided everything else, and you got the Samadhi part. That's the beauty of it.

Firstly the Dhyaana. First when you have seeking, you put your attention towards the object of your worship. That’s called as Dhyaana.

And the Dhaarana is the one in which you put all your effort, concentrate all your effort. But this is all drama for people who are not realized.

For them it's just a sort of an acting that they do. But for a realized soul it is a reality.

So the first, the Dhyaana, you have to do.

Some do it of the Form, another of the Formless. But you are so fortunate that the Formless has become a form for you. No problem – you don't have to go from form to formless and from formless to form, it's all there, in a bundle.

So you concentrate, or think, of some Deity or some point for Nirakar, for the Formless, or of Nirakar itself.

It's also mental projection as long as you are not a realized soul. But once you are realized, you have to just think of Dhyaana – whom you are going to concentrate, or you can say, on meditate.

But once you start meditating on a person your attention starts moving. That is also possible after Realization, though it’s in a bundle, but some people have it part of it, part of it, like that. So when you meditate, still your attention can get disturbed every moment. It can happen, depending on the intensity of your concentration.

So there are some Sahaja Yogis I’ve seen – they are cooking, and there's another one who is meditating. The meditating one will say, “Oh I can smell it is burning” – so there is no Dhaarana. Dhaar means a flow, a continuous flow. [The term "dhaarana" could be written "dhaaranaa" to mean that the accentuation is on both "a". Thus, one does not confuseit with the word "dhara" धर which means "supporting," when "Dhaaraa" धारा means "continuous flow"].
So there is no Dhaarana. Dhyaana is there, but not Dhaarana. The second part of it is very important – that you have to put your attention continuously on to your Deity.

Then you develop a state, which is called as Dhaarana, in which your attention becomes one with the Deity. But when these mature, the third stage of Samadhi comes in.

Now for people who think that without Realization they can do it, I think they are absolutely mistaken. But after Realization also, when the Dhaarana is established, you have to get to the position where you become Samadhi.

Now, what is that state? When that state comes into your mind, then whatever you do, the Deity that you worship – you see that Deity in your work. Whatever you see, you see the Deity giving you the show – we can put it like that. Whatever you hear, you find the Deity telling you the Truth. Whatever you read, you find there what the Deity would tell you.

So in that state, whatever you do with your eyes, nose, and all these organs, all that becomes a kind of a manifestation of the Deity whom you worship – automatically. You don't have to think, ”Now I must concentrate, all right. I will not have these thoughts, I have to now think about this”. It becomes automatically that. You read a book, in that book immediately you find what is good for Sahaja Yoga. If there’s a book, which is anti-God, you discard it. Just call [SOUNDS LIKE marina] there. But if you have a problem, you see that, “It must be for some lesson to me; that it is to teach me some experience”. It is the manifestation of the Deity itself. For example a lady feels she is going to have an abortion, take a position. So one person who is not yet in Samadhi Avasta, or condition, will say, “Oh God, I'm such a Sahaja Yogi, I’ve done so much for Mother. I went all the way to Pulborough thing, and despite that, see, this is the problem”. But another would say that, “All right let me try. I’ll go and tell Mother”. On the photograph, or may be telephone, something. And he’ll find to his surprise, that it’s all done, it’s perfectly all right. This is only possible if you are a Realized soul, otherwise not possible.

So the state that is awakened within you is called, is a new state of mind, in Sanskrit language it has a very beautiful name is Ritambhara Pragnya. Which is a very difficult thing. Ritambhara Pragnya. Ritambhara means the whole, Dhaar means a flow, a continuous flow is the name of the Nature. And that the whole Nature one feels, is enlightened.

I’ll give an example – when a child is to be born, the mother start lactating, automatically. The Nature itself works out for the birth of the child.

In the same way, when this Ritambhara Pragnya start expressing itself, only for Sahaja Yogis, nobody else, you are amazed how things work out suddenly. Ritambhara Pragnya it works out.

Now the time is very short, but I’ll give you an example. I came to Brighton, and Jason said, “Mother let's have Guru Puja in Brighton”. I said, “All right, have it. But you find out the place”. So he went to the university, said, “The university people will help, but it’s rather small and…” I said, “But ask them”. But, “No, it’s booked on Guru Puja”. Then I said, ”Then what can you do?” He said, “What to do Mother?”

I said, “You try somewhere else just now, telephone to somebody else”. So went through yellow pages, I don't know what, and he telephoned, and they said, “We have a place, a beautiful place, and You come along (Shri Mataji laughs) and have lunch with us.” Just he came there, went there. He had a very nice lunch, they were very happy. They were to accommodate everyone, they were very nice, and he was amazed how everything has worked out so well.

So the Ritambhara Pragya has started working in your favor. You all tell Me, ”This is a miracle, that has happened Mother, and we don't know how it has happened”.

I’ll give you an example – yesterday you we were doing something with cement and the Italian boy said that we’ll need two bags of cement. I said, “You carry on, it won’t finish”. Even before I was leaving, they were carrying on, still not finished. Now cement of all the things, imagine!

So this special thing is your own state, where you are feeling the oneness with the Nature and the Nature is feeling oneness with you. So the Divine itself is expressing through Nature, through various happenings, through various incidents – the Love, the protection, the attention that the Divine is giving. And there’s no end to it. It just happens, and people don’t know how it happens. But that is what is the state of Samadhi.

But there could be people if I tell them, “Will you do this?” “Oh no Mother, the shop will be closed. Or, “They won't do it, that’s not all right”. They go on like that. And there are people who say, “No! Let’s see. If Mother has said – maybe”.

I’ll give you another simple example, very simple, absolutely gross, but it’s there. One day Mr. Srivastava, he takes one type of tea, very English! And he wouldn’t like other tea, you see, so he told Me, “Oh God, we are finished with the tea and what to do tomorrow morning?”. I said, ”It’s all right, let us go to the tea shop’. So he said, “It is eight o’clock in the night and what do you mean? They’ll all laugh at us. There is no shop at eight o’clock open”. That tea center. I said, “Let's go, what's the harm, I’m just saying let’s go”, but he said “What absurd things you are saying!” I said, “All right, absurd whatever it is, let's go”. So I, he wouldn't listen so I told the driver “Alright, let's drive down”. We went there, and the lights were on. We said, “Ay! How is it the lights are on?” So we walked in, you see, very peevishly, and they all were there standing, “Oh we’ve been waiting for you such a long time, you know, and you are the last to come, just imagine!” So I asked My husband. He said, “I forgot we had a reception here”. (Shri Mataji laughs). And they said, “You are the last to arrive”. And they said, “All right, doesn’t matter but you’ll have your presents”. So they gave us two tins each of tea.

I mean, there are thousand and one examples like that. Today like some were trying to push the bed. The three of them were trying, it would not push. I said, “All right, I'll push’. I just put My Nabhi there, just, I didn’t push anything, it just pushed – because of the Ritambhara Pragnya . But this is not [SOUNDS LIKE chamatkar] or anything. It exists in the Divine the capacity to manifest It’s love, to show that you are the saints, you are the chosen ones of God. But you accept that situation first. But if you behave like all other normal people, “Oh God, shops are closed, and that man is so difficult, and I don’t think it will happen” – never happen.

But you must know you are saints, chosen, and given birth by Me – The Form and the Formless. So this Pragya is going to manifest, is manifesting every moment. Be prepared. Be happy. Welcome it, and accept that you are there. The level is different.

Time? (A Sahaja Yogi, “Five minutes left”) Ah? Five minutes more. I shouldn’t do anything that side (Shri Mataji laughs). All right.

Now the time has come for Sahaja Yoga to change it’s level. We have to change. We have to go higher. The level has to come up. But Sahaja Yoga is such a cosmopolitan thing that we have got the worst bhoots to the highest, on the same plate.

Now, some of them are round ones, which are the ego-oriented ones, who roll all the time. We don’t know how to raise the plate, you see. If you raise the plate they’ll roll down. So you are frightened you have to hold them.

And there are some who are squares. And the square ones are carrying other squares on their heads, like bhoots. So if you raise them they may all topple down, or maybe the bhoots might fall off, God knows.

But there are third type who are prisms, more like pyramids – who are nicely settled down, whatever level you raise them, they are stuck there.

So those who are at the periphery are a problem, definitely, for Me. Because in My compassion I cannot throw them out. And we have to help them to come out, by really now, telling them, that they have to rise. How long are we to wait for them? Everyone has to see that the peripheral people are brought in properly so that they don’t go out of Sahaja Yoga. Compassion is all right but not at the cost of keeping the level of Sahaja Yoga lower – never!

We have to raise the level of people who are well settled in Sahaja Yoga. So everybody must try to settle down and come up to minimum standards at least. Otherwise, I’m sorry many will be sieved out. That’s for the five minutes! I’ll have another, I think, one hour or so, one and a half hour later on today.

Thank you very much.

I would say that somebody should translate it if possible. Is it possible to translate?

A sahaja yogi: We’ll translate it afterwards, Mother.

Shri Mataji: In French after? To be told them Ritambhara Pragnya and all that. Later on you can translate. I mean those who have to go for lunch now should be English then. Then he can explain it, the first part, as you please. Those who are staying here, should not. Those who are come, should. It’s wrong. The guests must be looked after, I mean, the other way round. Now we have to divide in two halves, but I would say those who understand English should go because then Gregoire can speak about this and somebody can translate also in Italian.

Gregoire: Shri Mother, I’m sorry, but it’s already divided with numbers in two lots, so I think the first number has just to go.

Shri Mataji: Is it already divided?

Gregoire: Yes it’s already.

Shri Mataji: Organized!!!

Gregoire: Organized. (laughter and applause)

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. I didn’t know who is here unhappy. Both of you have come?

A sahaja yogi: Mother?

Shri Mataji: Only two of you have come?

A sahaja yogi: Three.

Shri Mataji: Who is?

A sahaja yogi: [inaudible].

Shri Mataji: Who?

A sahaja yogi: [inaudible].

Shri Mataji: Good, good. Easier. Good. So how are you?

A sahaja yogi: I’m already all right.

…support Sahaja Yoga. Like Dr. Warren has brought a very good extract, I think. Is it an extract? Just imagine! He was a catholic Christian church fellow who could say all these things so clearly and see so clearly. And this book, you see, that a book. But now Rustam told Me that he has found out in the Koran [sounds like Ishelif] that the Kundalini is resides in the triangular bone is called as Asas. And at the time of Resurrection this will be raised and people will get their Realization. Can you imagine?

The second thing he said the same thing which has written in these books that there are seven firmaments and there are seven powers. Can you imagine? All that is described in the Koran and what are these Muslims doing and what are these Christians doing? But even those who knew, the Hindus so-called, what are they doing, stupid. Everybody seems to be stupid. You can’t blame those who knew and you can’t blame those did not. They are just the same. It’s very clearly written all about the seven chakras and everything since the Patanjali. But who is seeking God? Bur these discoveries are coming up and they are going to substantiate and you are going to talk to this people about the kind of things they have been doing to the essence of religion. But these are all authentic thing. People want to believe into something that has happened. That’s a good thing in a way because we have some certificates.

Nobody wants to ask any questions to Me? Because one third is missing so I would like to speak about general things later on. Yes, yes.

A sahaja yogi: [NOT AUDIBLE].

Shri Mataji: Come here, I can’t hear. Yeah.

A sahaja yogi: Some talking about the man looks like a Muslim with a beard and in Buddhism they are talking Matreya who is a fat man. Religions are talking about the coming of their own foramina projecting. What about this? But they are all talking about your coming.

Shri Mataji: You see, matter of these scriptures are mitigated and changed also. And the Buddha is of course is a laughing Buddha. They think of laughing Buddha. Then because it was Mohammed Sahib they think of a fakir. Because your mind is like a projector. And the film is what you have seen before. Like Mohammed Sahib. So the mind projects it and you get Mohammed Sahib as the image. So whatever film you are using it depends on.

But whatever has happened never happens again. So if you have seen with the film, say, for example, if you have made a film. It’s made once for all. You do not make the same film, do you? I mean you are having “Mouse Trap” for so many days here, for example. But every time you see that acting changes. And every two-three years the actors also change.

So though the essence is the same going on the same thing is now going to be repeated, Mohammed’s life is not going to be repeated, nor is He going to come in the way He came as a fakir. No. That has never happened in the history, why will it happen? So every time whatever has to happen has to be new, that’s the style the Nature is. It doesn’t want to bore you say with the same (Shri Mataji laughs). And that kind of life no more needed also.

And thirdly, as the seed grows first the roots have to fight a lot to embed the seed. And then shoot has to fight a lot.

But when the tree is there then it supports others, it helps others. It becomes a strong flowering plant or a flowering tree.

So the whole thing is changed every moment, which is no more the seed. But people want to see the seed again. Why? You identified, very subtle identified.

Christians are more identified with Christ than with Mohammed Sahib. Why? When the Muslims are much more identified with Mohammed Sahib. But why? Is there any reason? They equally intensely identified for no rhyme and reason. None of Them gave them Realization. They told the same thing. But why this identification so much with this?

Now, when you are walking, you are thirsty, you see a river – whether it is the river Ganges or Jamuna or any other river – if you are thirsty you’ll drink. You won’t say, “Now I won’t drink because the Ganges is not here”. Now supposing I, say, in England, “I will only have the Ganges water”. Will I have? But they are mad people I tell you, even in India. I was told some people brought the water of Ganges and the clay from there to clean their hands here, from India. I mean they can do it.

This is what Sahaja Yogis must understand. That drop out your identifications with the past life. If you are born a Christian, all right, so what? Now you are a Sahaja Yogi. If you are born as a Muslim so what? Now you are a Sahaja Yogi. The second part – what happens to you – I’ll tell when we have the second lecture. That as a Sahaja Yogi how things drop out automatically. All right?

So these people are not the ones who are really following any religion whatsoever. They are following their ego religion. That’s all. There’s no religion in this kind of thing. So all these identifications just should drop out when you understand. Only there’s one way of convincing them is to show that all of Them who have died, who are no more here have said that Sahaja Yoga is going to come. That’s the only way you can convince these hard nuts. This is the problem.

But surprisingly Muslims never talk of Resurrection. They are not bothered about Resurrection, they are only worried about the dooms, they are like French. French are now thinking that Doom’s days going to come definitely. I mean somebody asked Me, “Are You sure it’s going to come or it’s postponed?” I said, “Postponed. Forever” (Shri Mataji laughs). Very seriously, I tell you. Very serious people, ah? Asked Me that, “What do You say if Doom’s Day is coming or not?” And they were quite disappointed because they are banking upon it (Shri Mataji laughs). This could be with anyone, I’ve just say French because they were French who asked Me, but could be anyone. I mean don’t be identified again.

Like I was telling today that they show advertisements sometimes so horrible that they will show as if some miracle is going to happen and suddenly lot of ice will break, this will happen, that will happen and what will come out is a lager. I mean really from sublime to ridiculous, horrible. Just can’t understand that. But I really laughed you know one day. There was a gentleman sitting and said, “Why did you laugh?” I said, “What is this sublime to ridiculous?” He said, “What do you mean? I like my beer” I said, “Sorry”. That’s it. The identification is like that, you see. Even ridiculous things start looking so fine if you identified.

I hope all of you are Sahaja Yogis here. But they are still doubting, Tomas is sitting. They will have a bad time I must say with a very powerful session. Now don’t you worry. Don’t doubt yourself, it’s all right.

What about other questions? That was a good one.

Don’t depend on their images. That’s why these days most of the gurus are keeping diaries. It’s very easy to grow that, “I can’t”, but for any person to grow is all right and you feel they don’t grow they can put on one. To do become [UNCLEAR WORD – major ?] with them.

Sahaja yogini: What happens with those people who got Realization from You at Your programs, but they don’t getting to Sahaja Yoga? What happens with them?

Shri Mataji: They don’t grow, they advanced.

Sahaja yogini: What’s the meaning of that…

Shri Mataji: That’s very bad too. They are seed, which has been sprouted and goes to waste, is a real waste. Because, which is not sprouted, may one day sprout. It’s a real waste I tell you. But mostly they come back, quite do after come back. They go, come, like that, you see. There’s no understanding about the graveness of this kind of a shallow behavior.

They don’t understand. That’s why they behave like this. But then they get something horrible and they come to Sahaja Yoga. They go into problems and then they come, but the progress is so little. I mean the one who must have come with them goes much higher.

So what is the program in the evening? Now are you going to do it.

Sahaja yogi: It’s written on the program, Mother.

Shri Mataji: All right, it’s all organized. If Sahaja Yogis organize I have to obey (laughter).

Sahaja yogi: Afternoon it’s a writers meeting with the publisher.

Shri Mataji: What the meeting?

Sahaja yogi: Writers, they set it before Your arrival.

Shri Mataji: What was it?

Sahaja yogi: It says, “Writers connect their meeting with publisher, they knew You to be announced”. Or be the general rehearsal in lecture hall.

SHRI MATAJI: But who were the writers?

Sahaja yogi: It doesn’t say it. Then it’s a most spontaneous and unplanned event.

Shri Mataji: Gavin, are you writing poetry (Shri Mataji laughs)?

Gavin: No, it’s written, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Who is writing, you? Yourself.

Sahaja yogi: This is Jason.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja yogi: They’re just writing it up.

Shri Mataji: They said that, [SOUNDS LIKE Yuhabu se pare Isata] – the Moses have written and the one who knows about Moses has written is only Isa means Jesus Christ. Ah, so what is it, spontaneously?

Sahaja yogi: Spontaneous and unplanned events and preparation for Shri Mataji’s arrival (Laughter).

Shri Mataji: He is playing safe. All right, then.

Sahaja yogi: Then 4 o’clock p.m., approximately (Shri Mataji is laughing and saying, “Good”) Shri Mataji arrives. This is subject to change.

Shri Mataji: All right, then.

Sahaja yogi: Then is nothing until 7 o’clock.

Shri Mataji: Ah, then, nothing until 7 o’clock? That’s the way. Now till I tell you tarry it like that, spontaneously. I’ve arrived earlier. So, what you do now, you have your lunch and rest for a while. And then after the lunch about an hour or so you come along and assemble here. And you have a thing called this ”Brain Trust Business”. Where were you talk to each other, have a report, ask questions, tell people, like that. Is a very good thing, you have appointed some people for that. Go about like that till you have your tea. Then after tea I’ll take over. All right? But that doesn’t mean you should not attain all the rest. You all should sit down and talk. It helps a lot. And help each other. Ask questions and things openly. And then after that is the dinner and after dinner what time is the tea?

Sahaja yogi: There’s tea as such, Mother. They fixed time is 7o’clock for that barbecue dinner and then the dance, singing and…

Shri Mataji: All right. And the tea in what time?

Sahaja yogi: I think we can have it about open, there’s nothing written down.

Shri Mataji: 5 o’clock? 5 o’clock. See, 4:45. Finish it by 5, say, ooh? And let’s start it 5:30 to 6 or 7. Then we’ll have a barbecue dinner and after the barbecue dinner we’ll have that music program. All right? Then tomorrow you can have dhaana – meditation in the morning and about, say, you must get up early. And after that I mean you can get your tea, I don’t know whenever you feel like, I mean, I don’t know what’s the style is. And after the dhaana is over then you can come for your breakfast or whatever it is. And then you have again a little seminar sort of a thing. This is at 12 you go forth. Yes?

Sahaja yogi: But tomorrow there’s no staff here, there’s not arranged much here.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Then what. There is no problem. Tomorrow is the Puja day, so you need not have a seminar or anything, anything like that. We can start our Puja say, say, should be at 10 about and have a food after Puja. That’s how we are after that, after that, after that. All right?

May God bless you.

So can I retire now in My room? Thank you very much.
