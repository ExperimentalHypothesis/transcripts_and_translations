 March April SHRI GANESHA PUJA. 1999 2000 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI GANESHA PUJA 25.9.99 (Cabella) Discourse by Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi these problems, all such people, who suffer from the right side, should worship Shri Ganesha. For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you. You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing extra work, I should say, ODAY We have gathered here to worship Shri Ganesha. You Ã¤ll know what a powerful deity He is. His power comes from his innocence. When we see small children we are automatically compelled towards them and also we want to love them, kiss them than normal. But you think you are doing a very great job of God. As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected and such a man can beceome either very dry or very self indulgent. One of the two things come up and he does not know where he is going. The only thing that keeps you in the middle, in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha's Puja, Shri Ganesha's worship by which you can always be in the centre. All these diseases of the right side can be and be with them. And very innocent they are, extremely innocent, and when we worship Shri Ganesha we have to know if we have been really innocent or not. These days people have become extremely cunning, and they don't mind any amount of cunning. They play all kinds of cunning games on others who are innocent and simple. They can justify themselves always that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times when everybody is so cunning. This cunningness can take you to the other Now there are various ways people extreme of right side, which is very much worship Shri Ganesha but there is a punishable, in the sense that some peoplesimple way to remember him and sit develop all kinds of problems, which are before his photograph and take vibrations physical, you can say. Like their hands from him. Thats the best way you can can get paralysed or their leg can get balance yourself. There are so many paralysed. AIso, they can have other worries, there are so many struggles you cured by Shri Ganesha's Puja. have. All these can be neutralised by Shri troubles with their liver treatments and Ganesha. Though innocent, He is extremely clever and when he comes to all that. All this comes up. Then to punish them a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in. At this time, when you have your help you are amazed. How he works

 SHRI GANESHA PUJA, 1999 March - April 2000 The Divine Cool Breeze very difficult times. It is his style that he it out and how he removes all the hurdles manages things so weil because he is a Ganpati. Ganpati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas. As I have told you Ganas exist within us. Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies and all the worries from you. So this is the most important deity we have. Though its a very simple deity. This Mooladhar chakra is very very complicated. It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think, because it has many waves, it has many compartments. We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating. So to study down these you should try to be who report if there is any problem. They report to the brain that there is a problem and on the sternum bone is the residence or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga. So whenever there is any problem absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha. we are found into some trouble, sternum bone starts vibrating and these bodies Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was which are Ganas get the information. incarnated as Jesus Christ, and Jesus was Antibodies they are called in the medical also a very innocent person. If he was not terminology. Then these Ganas attack. They can target also. They know how to innocent, He would not have been crucified, but he was not a cunning fellow target the troubles and attack it, one may think that only the people who are to see the cunning of others. His own disciple deceived him and still he knew suffering medically are helped by Ganas is not true. Also the people who are who it was, he never said who it was. If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty, mentally upset, who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas. These is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality and wherever he saw anything wrong done he is to go all out to fight it. Same is Shri Ganesha. Ganas are so good at targeting their problems that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out. For example Shri Ganesha's blessings are very say something happens to someone, some important for all the people who are child, somewhere. Now his parents start specially proe to some sort of a hurdle crying for Mother and the Mother is the or 'Sankata as they call it'. He is called as Durga say, then what happens, that they Sankata Vimochan, the one who takes immediately rush to that place and you out of all the hurdles of life. So many miraculously they cure the boy. of you have experienced how he has miraculously they say. So many helped you in different troubles and miraculous thing that have happened in hurdles and also different type of very your life you cannot explain, but they are

 March April 2000 4 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI GANESHA PUJA, 1999 they brought out the boy and he was treated by the doctors also but also with vibrations and today that boy is perfectly alright, while the doctors had said he can all due to this Ganapati's Ganas. They are also small like him and they are very active and very alert. They never sleep. Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go and attack the problem and find out solution for him. It is something unbelievable how they act and how they never survive. If there is one chance of his surviving, he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time. This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America. So, like this, so many things inform. Ican give you so many examples that have happened like this. For example there was a boy who got drowned in one of our happen and people tell me that Mother its your 'kripa', your blessings that this has happened. ashrams in America in the swimming pool. They were all jumping in the In a way, it is very distantly, I should say, swimming pool, I didn't like the idea of but because of Shri Ganesha. Now Shri swimming pool very much because there Ganesha's another quality is that he is were children. So one boy fell down into extremely obedient to Mother. He does that and was inside for about 15 to 20 not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one. minutes. Nobody knew he was there. So To him his Mother is everything. So he can fight with his father, Shiva, he can fight with anyone because to him is then they tried to find out the body of the boy and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone? Then they discovered that he was in that swimming complete obedience and absolutely quick Tatpar', just quickly understands what is pool. After that they got so frightened and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy. Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram, I didn't know even the address, but I asked to telephone to this number, on my own. I don't know the desire of the Mother and he works it out. His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like but His work is tremendous. Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem, they are extremely quick and they are very fast. The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste, who have chastity as the prime thing in their life. Chastity is very much anybody's numbers and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water and he will be saved. Nobody had told me anything. "Don't worry he will be perfectly alright." Then worshipped by him. Its not only in women

 March - April 2000 SHRI GANESHA PUJA, 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze but also in men, he expects chastity to be present. After getting realisation you should be absolutely chaste people, you shouldn't have your eyes rolling around country, who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism and where people are also having very bad morals. He creates problems for them. What happens that He tells the Mother earth to every where and sort of what you can call create the earthquakes. Earthquake takes place in places where there is no respect of chastity, also where there are a very bad method of communicating with young women and young men and spoiling your chastity. Even your eyes should be cleaned, even your thoughts should be cleaned. For that you should introspect and see for yourself what mistakes you have committed and what kind of an unchaste behaviour you have. You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you. If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything. He is so innocent and beautiful that he fundamentalist and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic. This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother. So the Mother earth also understands. Now we have so many earthquakes, one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan, but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died. So he protects them. He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind, he tries to destroy them, and he has destroyed many like this even before. Also, the Mother forgives you, but that is a very important thing. Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity. We should be very chaste. So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity. But religions earth's powers he has got, is that he is magnetic, he attracts people towards have become so useless now, have himself, people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily. So that is become without any basis, without any proper execution, of what is written for them. They do all kinds of things and they magnetic power that he has got within himself. call themselves Hindus, Muslims, Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds, also in many animals but specially in the birds. That's Christians, all kinds of religions. Actually the religions have failed completely and that's why Shri Ganesha gets after them. how they can follow direction where they have to go. They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia. How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place. It also is in the Another thing about Shri Ganesh is that he is created out of the Mother earth. He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth. So if he doesn't like people of some

 March - April SHRI GANESHA PUJA, 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze 2000 Ganesha. So like that they were doing to fishes. Fishes also are found say in the waters which are coming from some hills, so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how, they go back to their own place. So going back to the same place is only possible if there is a way of knowing the direction. But they know the direction, they have a sense of this one statue that they had and they were dancing before it. But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home, they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha. At that time the earth moved direction, also they are bound by their own qualities. For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog, and a lion will be a lion. But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them. So they could be anything, you can't say and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything. And once they become anything like that you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level when they are human beings. But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives. So they can go to any level, and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself. They all disappeared into earth. Apart from that there were many others also who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth. And our Ashram was there, a kind of a centre and around the centre there was a very beautiful land but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least quite a long distance, a big gap came in and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the centre and nobody was harmed. They were all at home. They were all right. But this happened, that our any place. Ashram was not at all touched and this is Another example, I give you a very big how they saved the Ashram and not a earthquake we had in India, in Latur. In single Sahaja Yogi died. It is really very Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri remarkable how the protection is given Ganesha where they take Shri Ganesha by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas. and put it in the sea or in the water of a So we must respect his Ganas, very river. So there, in Latur, these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganasha. important is to see that they are all around within us, they are acting within us. They Before the statue they dance and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad, music from some very funny films see us what sort of person you are, and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha by your misbehaviour they try to see that or something. It's so bad that you just can't you again go back to normal. They give bear it. Very bad and that upsets Shri

 SHRI GANESHA PUJA, 1999 March - April 2000 The Divine Cool Breeze not for worship. There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph. you a chance many a times. But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego, you are very badly hit by There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth. I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris, the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people. I went to one of them and he said, "I am getting Asthama", "I am getting him and that is the biggest, I should say, calamity for you people. So you must worship Shri Ganesha but I always say don't worship every Shri Ganesha which is being created by those, we can say, artisans. Because God knows what sort paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha, my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha and how he is doing this to us." I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead, what do of Artisans they are. For money's sake they might be making Ganesha and they might not have got any idea of Chastity. Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas, so we you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha's Pujari. And then he realized it. are not at all helped by this. That's why Mohammad Saheb has said, don't do any worship of any idol because I said, "I will cure you now. Its all right but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality. Try to these idols have been created by human beings who are not authorised to do that. lead an innocent life, not of outwitting They are not Swayambhus Ha. They another and being very cunning and are not created by the mother earth but clever. Shri Ganesha's troubles, are really, are copied by people who are just wanting I can't count them even, how much it can to make money out of them. So that's how hamper, or how much it can give you any idol you get, say, from the shops trouble, how much it can take you nearer need not be worshiped, it is not to be to your death. He is so powerful, because worshiped, any idol whatsoever. So all his energy is for the divine work of his whatever is not there, we should not Mother, all his energy. vorship because it is made by somebody who has very bad vibrations, who is a He doesn't do anything, he doesn't want cheat, who is very cunning and thinks no anything. Just all his energy is for that and end of himself. With such a person if you he is asking for what is simple, what you buy a Shri Ganesha it is going to harm can call Modaka, a kind of a thing they you, is not going to help you. You can make out of coconut. That's what he eats. His body is so subtle and so, so powerful have it for decoration in the house but

 March - April 2000 SHRI GANESHA PUJA, 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze Ganesha. that he can move mountains after mountains. With his simplicity, with his All these things are there but we cannot sweetness, and with his innocence he can understand it because we are confused. We don't want to see it in a proper sense that this is already written there. So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha and whatever you say to Christ really change people. People who are very harsh, can be changed. His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika, of the right direction. But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy. When It was used by Hitler in the beginning, it was you are saying it to Shri Ganesha. They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other. All the things I have the right type and he was successful. But then what happened, they had stencils and told you about Christ, you can try to find out and you will prove it. Like Christ had these two fingers, this means one finger they started using it from the otherside. So it was from the left side, they started other way round and then they were all destroyed. How powerful is Shri is for the Vishuddi as we say Shri Krishna and this one is Vishnu's means this is his Ganesha's Swastika, you can say. Also we have proved now that Swastika if you see from left to the right, is actually from the Carbon atom. The carbon atom has got father's. That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna. Very clearly he used to do, why didn't he use other fingers, only these two fingers why did he use. Pointing Swastika and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms, all put in series. out towards his father who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna. Now if you look at it from the left side, It is easy to understand what I am saying, if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha. If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed, that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless, you have proved it now, look at it from the left side to right side, what you see is Onkar. If you see it from right side to left side, you see the Swastika, and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross. So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ and he is because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya. So it all opens out and all the stupid ideas about getting the Agnya, this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself, just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya. The and out of the half of the egg became cunningness that comes from Agnya is Christ and half of the egg was Shri absolutely finished. You are no more the one who is worshipped all over the world, is already written in the Devi Mahatmaya if you read it, is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

 March- April 2000 SHRI GANESHA PUJA, 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze cunning. When you see this innocence on your forehead, you are amazed at yourself earth is a wrong idea, is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution. To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing that mother has produced and just to use it for money is a very wrong thing. One should think about it and when you cut one tree also you should put another one there. That is the beauty of the Mother earth, all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother carth. and all such ideas just disappear. You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others. You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out. This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing. When you sit on the ground also it helps more because the mother of Shri Ganesha is Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest. I don't this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth and that's why we should look after the know how they live but they do without taking any interest in gardening or in the mother earth. We don't look after the mother earth. We don't understand the nature. Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature, it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized that it value of mother earth. Actually in Indian culture it is that when you are getting up in the morning, you must say Namaskar should get the sunrays. There is no quarrel about it. They are so well organized, bow to you, O. Mother earth because I everything is so beautiful and it is never am touching you with my feet. Such destroyed also by any animals. You will respect you should have for Mother earth, be amazed. The animals also don't then you won't exploit it, you won't have destroy, at the most they might eat some to the Mother earth because saying that I today's problems of pollution and this and grass or something, but normally animals do not destroy any tree, do not destroy that. It all comes out of our ignorance that the anything as we destroy the Mother earth Mother earth is the mother of Shri for our own use. Whatever may be the Ganesha who's chakra we have got as cry for this, we have to understand that Mooladhara. If you understand this you we have to respect to the Mother earth. will be able to understand, what is to be Mother earth is the mother of Shri done. The mother earth itself we should Ganesha, who is our, you should say the look after, we can glorify her, we can eldest Sahaja Yogi. He never had to take beautify her, we can do all kinds of things but the way we are exploiting the mother to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time. He is the greatest yogi we have and the way

 March - April 2000 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI GANESHA PUJA, 1999 10 he is doing right things all the time. He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible, I would say. He is the greatest deity we have and much more for men. Shri Ganesha is very important thing because men can develop so many diseases if they do not respect Shri Ganesha. Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha because he is all the we should really worship him. Through him all deities are worshiped and are made happy and blissful. So this is today's thing was that I was just thinking that now a time repairing our body. He is all the time looking after, protecting us and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara. He is the days, in modern times how we have become shameless, how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honour. one who is looking after our Kundalini, he is protecting our Kundalini. If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up but If we have any honour you will have the chastity but you are dishonouring yourself and you think you have been very very smart and modern by becoming so sinful. All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it. You should go no way near because the one who supports her and, keeps her up, awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out. He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini which is also a basis of your self realisation. So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know, and you should find out about yourself, introspect thats all wrong and that's how Shri that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha gets angry. Decency is very important in understanding, what is our important basis, is our chastity. In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt for saving their chastity. I come from the same family and you can imagine what courage they must be having, what faith they must be having, in their chastity that if we lose our chastity what's the use of our life. So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice to show that chastity is the most Ganesha? If we are, what are we doing about it? Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things. You will not like them, will not like such people. That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out. The children are the best as we know. Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful. In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there. He is the one who is really innocent but extremely extremely, protective of you, very much protective, with his important thing, we all should have. Its not only for women but also for men, very innocence. So we should also try to cherish our

 March - April 2000 SHRI GANESHA PUJA, 1999 11 The Divine Cool Breeze other countries it has happened but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular. They have many Maoris and all those people and they encourage all of them and its so surprising that they have so much talent and they are bringing innocence and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated, dominated, every thing happens, doesn't matter. They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people. As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it, people are talking about it that there should not be domination of the innocent them to this state to show that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia. Its a very good venture. simple people. It has happened but it all has to be changed, has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru, is a very big exist, like everywhere they went and mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha. It has also a very big trunk, going down. oppressed so many people. In America, I was surprised to see that there were so Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri many Red Indians, who are called as Indian Americans. They were all Ganesha, from the mother earth. He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there. But there I felt really the oppressed so much that they had to run away to different places and then I went to this place Canajohari. I found the vibrations were so good. That means they It is. And in Australia I thank him that were very innocent, simple people and because of him only Sahaja Yoga has Americans that time, who went there. worked so well and so easily, and tried to completely finish them. So they Government also has never troubled us went and hid in places like Canajohari but source, source of vibrations. Thats what or there has been no problem with them. I don't know what's this helping them but the Canajohari has such tremendous vibrations that I said look at this, so many perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as uluru which years have passed, still the people who is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is live there or worked about and were growing so much. In the same way every atsolutely enjoying this place were Red where, where ever you may be Shri Indians, the ones who were Indians, we Ganesha should be worshipped and you call them American Indians. But they are will be helped out and out miraculously. so simple and innocent and they were so, You will be helped, miraculously but first I think, spiritual people because they used do something about our chastity which is to worship the Mother. All the time they Shri Ganesha. May God Bless You. worship the Mother. Even I have seen in

 March April 2000 The Divine Cool Breeze 12 NAVRATRI PUJA NAVRATRI PUJA Cabella, 17-10-1999 Discourse by Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Tonight we have gathered here to do the Puja, to the Devi, that is, Mahakali we can call her, or Durga. So many types of forms, She has taken to kill the negative forces that are trying to trouble or to obstruct or even to grow, the people who were gentle and good, Her forms are of different types that we know about, that She destroyed so many rakshasas. She destroyed many evil doers. Also, we do not know that in the world wars that we to hate. But these forces join together sometimes to form a giant personality of evil which tries to torture the human beings and trouble them. They might take any name, they might call themselves by anything but they are absolutely hundred percent evil and for such persons there is no pity or compassion from the God Almighty. These are to be destroyed and that is the job of the Goddess, to destroy them, who is a Mother, full of compassion had She was there to protect the right and love. type of people and that's how they all survived the ill plan, the ill gotten plan of It's a very contradictory work the very cruel and evil people. The evil people Goddess has to do, to kill these people have a capaeity to hate and to expresS their hatred in every way that is possible. They are really born evil and there are also who become evil. When they are born because in the larger interest it is important that all such evil people should be destroyed completely, but they do not. They, like you go to jail for sometimes, like that, they go to hell for sometimes, suffer and again they come back much more stronger and then again try to trouble good, saintly people. It's a common style they are, all over the world. They can come in the form of a very good evil you can make them out that their whole style is so aggressive and so vindictive about things, but hatred has no limits, no limits at all because if they hate, someone then just to justify that hatred they will say all kinds of things, just to justify. But sometimes they don't even want to justify, they just feel that they hate and it's a fundamental right they have got man, of a very gentle man or of a man who knows a lot about God or they can also say that they can give you realisation.

 March- April 2000 NAVRATRI PUJA 13 The Divine Cool Breeze All kinds of lies they are capable of these people. While the good people also because they have that power-evil power sometimes follow suite, they also try to of doing evil. So, they take to all kind of follow them. It's very surprising why falsehood and they proclaim that we are should good people not understand what this and we are that and we can give you is good and what is bad? But that discrimination many good people also lack and that's why they take to wrong Actually they have come on this earth to things and then they go on justifying all ruin people. We have had many of these the time. Whatever they are doing is the false people and many stupid people right thing, is the best thing, they have this, all that. followed them. They never talked against the proof of it. each other. Christ has said, "Devil won't talk against its own house", as if they are Now, as you know there have been many in one house and in one house they live of them in this Kaliyuga and so many of and they can not talk, of something that them have now disappeared from this will disturb their collectivity or their earth and now they can not trouble us. fraternity. Their fraternity is so great that But, there are still some more who are wherever they are, they know that they exposed, people have exposed them so are together. Just imagine, all the evil much that no body can expose anybody people should join together and behave without any proof. But, they have such in this manner, is very surprising. That's courage and they are so full of confidence why they are very collective. Supposing, that they can do what they like and one has taken a particular part of the land. anybody tries to expose them, they will Then he dominates there, another takes definitely ruin that person. Few things up in another way, third one takes, there's they are doing-fÄ«rst of all, they put wrong no competition as such. Ultimate effort ideas into your head. They say that we is somehow or other to destroy all the are very great people, we are this, we are creation of God, all the good people of that. God has sent us, all sorts of things tne world, who will ultimately get their they will talk but there is no proof about it and human beings never ask for the self realisation and who will have the knowledge about reality. This kind of proof as to how do you say? What is the proof? So, the solution is Sahaja Yoga. In Sahaja Yoga you have the experience, you have the proof. Then you grow into it, immediately you cannot become a great atmosphere is the worst during Kaliyuga, and there are so many, stupid people who may be simple, who may be good natured but they are drawn by the evil doing of

 March - April 2000 The Divine Cool Breeze NAVRATRI PUJA 14 Sahaja Yogi, that's a fact. You have to will tell you by many ways that this is wrong, why you are doing wrong to some person. But, if you do not repent and come back on to the normal position, She gives you up. Once Mahakali gives you mature, it takes some time for some people, it takes some more time for some people, doesn't matter. But, you do mature. In the meanwhile if you try to go up, you are now exposed and become prone to all kinds of evil things. I would say, when you worship her, what you want? You want her to protect. In your discrimination, in your mistake you might do something wrong, may do something that is not good for you, could be very to these wrong people then there is no possibility, there is no way of again bringing you up. Specially those people who rise high in Sahaja Yoga. If they fall, they fall so low then even an ordinary Sahaja Yogi could say Mother, look at him, where has he gone! So, with all these things happening, what is our job, is to worship Mahakali within us because what does She do, perhaps, we are not very dangerous for you. But She is the person who guides you, how to avoid all the dangers. aware of. Now, She protects your life. She protects First and foremost thing She does is to protect us. Wherever you may be, what your body, She protects all organs of your body, She is the one who gives you all ever you may be doing, in whatever peril you may be, how-so-ever dangerously you may be placed in life, She protects the security of the life. In Her realm you feel completely secure, you are never afraid of anything. Because you have left you. First thing, She protects you. All the people who write to me how they were protected, how they were cured, how they were helped is this thing that they should know that all this has happened because of Mahakali power within you. She exists within you. When you are worshipping Mahakali, you are worshipping the Mahakali within you, with due respect you must know that this Mahakali is a very sensitive personality, She is very sensitive. If you try to do any wrong to anyone, She will guide you, She her realm, you have come out of it that's why, that is the reason, you are afraid. But, if you are under Her beautiful guidance and Her blessings you will never feel afraid to do anything, you will never do anything wrong also. As soon as you will try to do wrong, She will hold your hand. She is really the guiding person, She is the one who actually gives us our existence. Without Her we cannot exist because She is the one who is the power of Shri Shiva. She gives us so many things. For example, She gives us the

 March - April 2000 NAVRATRI PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze 15 relaxation, the sleep. She gives you the truth, She tells you what is the truth and what is not. Sometimes people so much in their ego, always try to believe that what I think is the truth. Then, She is the one who points it out by creating a maya, a kind of a confusion that you start thinking, what is this? So, She is called also the one who gives us 'Bhranti' means 'illusions'. She puts you to illusions also. She tests you, puts you to illusions and She then ultimately takes you out of the when you are like a child before Her, how can you worry about it! So, your worries are finished. She worries about you, you shouldn't worry about yourself. That's the point in it. Her security is so great, She is so secure Herself that She gives you all the security that you need. You can hold on to Her feet, you can hold on to Her image or to anything, you can even pray to Her. Many people are being cured only by praying to Her because She cures you. She can cure your diseases which are very complicated diseases, She can cure. illusions. She is the one who relaxes you because Now, what she likes-Mahakali likes the She take over all your responsibilities, She light. She is worshipped in the night takes over all your problems. She is the because then we can put on the lights. one who solves all the problems. It is we She likes enlightened person. Also, She who forget to leave all the problems to likes the light, She likes the sun, She likes Her. If you just leave problems to Her, something that will be completely all your problems are solved. Not only enlightened and brightened. You must that but you really feel blessed. It's not have heard about people who are called, only physical also it is mental that She I don't know what, but specially in the makes your mind absolutely free of West they use them, they have big teeth worries. She doesn't worry and She and they are the people, just imagine, they doesn't want you to worry. If you worry cannot exist before the sun. As soon as then She tries to show that while you are there is a sun rise they just want to go off worrying, you are denying Her, you are and sleep. They cannot see the sun 1.ot accepting Her. Worrying is because the light they can't bear. Now, something, is very common and people what has happened here that Mahakali has take great pride in it."O! I was worried." departed from them and when Mahakali How can you be worried when your has departed from them and then they are Mother is sakshaat Mahakali. She can kill afraid and such people are attacked by all the demons, She can finish all of them. these people who know they are afraid.

How can you play into his hands? And how can you do whatever wrongs he wants you to do? out this Mahakali thing. But, as it is, in the West specially, we are very hard working and very much sun oriented and we worship the sun. All this we do- worship the sun and also go right sided very much. Then it is She who gives us the balance. She is the one who gives us Secondly, against Her is the ego. The biggest problem is the ego today. Ego shows "no, no I can do," Ego says - I will work it out, the balance by relaxing us completely and protecting us. Sometimes we are competitive and we are really worried and we want to do something which we cannot do then we get upset and we don't know what to do. Then it is She who ego says - it will be done but the human beings, yield to ego, It is of a great satisfaction for them that their ego is so strong and they don't want to listen to the brings sleep to us. So, when we sleep She looks after us, She soothes us and She takes away our problems. So many things She is doing but what are we doing for Her that we should see. Main thing is that Mahakali forces. You have to be like children, really that's a state we have to be in, is to be innocent like we are ourselves worshipping Her. She children. She loves innocent people, She is likes that Her children should worship innocence Herself, She loves innocent Her. That on that level she can be one people and She looks after you much more with them, she can give them Her because you are innocent, you are not compassion, love and protection from all cunning, you are not very much trying to play the evil. But, it has to be understood those your ego on others. If you are innocent, She who are not yet settled, those who are helps you, She definitely will help you but not yet absolutely belonging to that land this ego has to be brought under control of security of Mahakali can be attacked because he is the worst enemy She has. and once they leave that area, they can She doesn't like your ego, She wants you be very badly injured, killed, whatever to be egoless, to be innocent. As you know may happen. that it is first She came and She created Shri Ganesha. That's why we worship Shri Ganesha, we have to be innocent, means. So, we are living in this Kaliyuga in a very dangerous times, means anything can happen. So we have to be very careful, we have to watch our mind, to see how it we are not planning to do something bad or good or anything but we are without any intentions. It's a timeless, activity. You

 The Divine Cool Breeze March - April 2000 NAVRATRI PUJA 17 just don't bother about what you are going compassion, compassion for each other, love for each other, also caring for others. That is something She loves. If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you are a realised soul She's always with you but she says what are you doing with your compassion? How many people you are giving realisation?How many people you are curing? How many people you are helping? She is quite aware of to do, what you are not going to do, what you should do-nothing of the kind. You are just existing in your complete innocence and enjoying yourself and making others enjoy. If there's one child in the house he can make hundred people dance, it's like that. Because these children have the power of innocence and that is what She respects. You sometimes feel that how people are cheats, how they cheat us, how they make all kinds of, I should say, aggressiveness, whatever you are doing. I should say it's such a tremendous power of Mahakali that She knows everything about you, everything. She knows, your mind, She knows your heart, She knows about your health. Everything She knows, actually She is the Mother in every way who cares for the little child. In that way She knows that sometimes how they try to also tell lies, all kinds of things they will do and they expect so much from you also but all this is happening, is happened. You shouldn't bother about these things, you should keep to your innocence and you will be surprised you will be completely innocent. So, like when you are very protected. How? because Mahakali will small, your mother looks after you. In the this child doesn't do anything, is very stand around you, She will look after you same way, this Mahakali looks after you. if you are innocent. Innocent person doesn't get angry. What is there to get Then the Mahasaraswati power comes in angry. Innocence has its own, I should and She educates you, She gives you say, strength, power. It's extremely other ideas of knowledge, this, that but powerful. Even a cruel man, if he sees a looking after the child in you, looking child he becomes little bit aware of it, after your innocence and your there's a child. The whole world is aware compassion is all done by this Mahakali that children should not be in any way power. So, She is extremely sensitive about her children. No body dare touch Her children. For her everybody is like a tortured or troubled, why? Because children are so innocent. So, the quality of innocence is going to really help you very much because She appreciates your child. Those who are realised souls specially, She thinks are Her children and quality of innocence. in no way they should be hurt, nothing Then another thing She loves in you is your

 March - April 2000 The Divine Cool Breeze NAVRATRI PUJA 18 should happen to them. She is always the end of our life! What is the purpose of following them. One can say if She is a person, how does She follow them, because She is omnipresent. She is present everywhere, everywhere in your life She is there, specially with Sahaja Yogis. She follows them up and down, everywhere, whatever you are doing. You are in an accident She's there to see you, this life? Why have we come on this earth? What is so special that we should live on this earth? All such fundamental questions start rising and then you just take to the seeking. In that also you have to understand the Mahalakshmi principle is very-very, very different from what people understand. They think if they are seeking it should be intelligible, it should be through their minds or could be rational, all this or scientific. That's how they move seeking the truth. It's not possible. Mahalakshmi's principle is like this, that you should have earnest desire to know the truth and truth and truth and nothing She's like an angel behind you and nothing can happen to you if you really worship her from your full heart, not for any gain, not for any achievement but for Her blessings. Her blessings are very great and they really have enriched human beings, they have enriched this earth, they have enriched everything because of the blessings of Mahakali. else. When you think like that then you will not take to other things. So many people took to drugs thinking that by doing that they will achieve their self realisation. It's a wrong idea. How can you Of course, then there comes the Mahalakshmi. Her thing is that in Mahalakshmi principle you become sort of detached. You start finding that what is this world after all, and a kind of a feeling of detachment comes into you and you start thinking that there must be something better, there must be truth beyond. Specially, people who have been tortured by bad people always think like get away from your awareness to achieve that. Awareness is the most important thing. If you can go into the realm of awareness then you have to understand the basic awareness is not to be lost. If your basic awareness is lost through drinking or through drugs or all these things that people do. They think that they are seeking that's why they are doing. So, sometimes they take excuse of seeking to do wrong things. It's like a revenge on yourself, I think, that you want to revenge on yourself by thinking that that that there must be someone who will raise us from this. Here comes the Mahalakshmi principle in you which is the principle of the Goddess, of ascent. She puts the ideas in your head that what is next? What do we have to do? After all, is this you are now seeking. It's not the real seeking. In a real seeking a person has to

If you pay the one fourth amount then he will give you the full knowledge. I said, how can he reciprocate, it's not proportionate, I said. When you were giving half, he was giving half, when you are giving one fourth, he is giving full. That's the thing, she said. he is very magnanimous, you see, that's the point. I said, for all such people who think they can purchase truth, they can Actually Kundalini awakening is the only way one can know the reality, there's no other way out. But no body tells that it is Kundalini awakening. They will tell you, we will go to this place, then to that place then, move to that place then, this has to be done and ultimately where do you come-where you started. It's just like that moving from places to places, moving from false to another false to another false to falsehood. not achieve it. You can not purchase it, Ultimately so many seekers have been lost. you can not pay for your Kundalini So many have been lost because they payment for that. awakening, no, nor you should take any thought that certain type of seeking is very precious, because you can pay lots of Self realisation is absolutely the divine money to the guru. I mean, you can grace and you can not take money for purchase the guru and so all the rich that. You can not sell it. It's not so cheap people can become enlightened, that means that. But I don't think the to be sold. If you understand that then the Mahalakshmi power works and Mahalakshmi power is really meant for people who are genuine seekers, who are really seeking genuinely. It acts and works so well that they achieve a kind of a very- very spontaneous realisation. This spontaneous realisation you all have got percentage of good people are all only rich. The people who are good are good whether they are rich or not is not the point. But such people try to gather round a person because I think there's a subtle ego of their money that we can afford to buy this, buy that.

You must find out what these false people are whole world you can get it and it is spreading fast. Now, it's also the duty of Sahaja very doing? It's very easy because you are enlightened and with your enlightened attention you can definitely find out what's wrong with what organisation, with which you will do it. It will be the best way to meditate. Not to be aggressive in any way but just to meditate and ask Mahakali- Yogis to spread Sahaja Yoga. Now, this one is to be understood that Mahalakshmi and Mahakali both go hand in hand. When, Mahakali blesses you and She is with you and you are in her realm the Mahalakshmi comes forward and She definitely helps you to achieve your realisationa and also to improve your destroy, destroy him for he is destroying the world, you please destroy him. That's Her problems to help you, I mean, the financial side of it, you can call it or in any way other problems also, She solves. The greatest problem She solves that your greatest desire, to achieve self realisation, is granted. So, there's is no competition between them. All these three powers job and She would love to do but somebody has to tell Her and ask Her. It's very good because there are so many that unless and until you point it out She may not be able to put Her attention to them possibly. So, best is always ask Her to help you on individual basis, on a national basis, may be work together and whatever is needed they work it out. But, it is the Mahakali who guides, where what help has to go on a collective basis or maybe on global basis. That's what. She exists every where, She is globally available. Anywhere, you and that's why the power of Mahakali is very much respected. As it is She has killed so many devils, and so many rakshasas and still there are some more, may be having any colour, any race, any nation, anything. But She exists within you all the time and to worship her and to awaken her is only your duty, that you have some of them are existing but I am sure they to do. will be all finished.

everything that exists, that has existed, shall exist and also
that exists for ever is contained in Your indescribable
being. Despite that, O Supreme Mother, out of Your
immeasurable love, You have assumed a form which is
similar to ours, only to give us guidance, protection,
salvation.
In spite of being the Most Powerful, the Most Complete,
the One Who contains everything, O Beloved Mother, You
have granted to Your children the opportunity of offering
Puja at Your Lotus Feet, only for our own benefit.
On this auspicious occasion of your 77th Birthday we all
the Sahaja children from the world most humbly and
respectfully invite You to Delhi and shower your blessings

Humbly,

Discourse by Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
these problems, all such people, who
suffer from the right side, should worship
Shri Ganesha. For example these days,
life is very much busy with all of you. You
are extremely busy with your work and
you are doing extra work, I should say,
ODAY We have gathered here to
worship Shri Ganesha. You Ã¤ll
know what a powerful deity He
is. His power comes from his innocence.
When we see small children we are
automatically compelled towards them
and also we want to love them, kiss them
than normal. But you think you are doing
a very great job of God. As a result Shri
Ganesha is neglected and such a man can
beceome either very dry or very self
indulgent. One of the two things come
up and he does not know where he is
going. The only thing that keeps you in
the middle, in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri
Ganesha's Puja, Shri Ganesha's worship
by which you can always be in the centre.
All these diseases of the right side can be
and be with them. And very innocent they
are, extremely innocent, and when we
worship Shri Ganesha we have to know
if we have been really innocent or not.
These days people have become
extremely cunning, and they don't mind
any amount of cunning. They play all
kinds of cunning games on others who
are innocent and simple. They can justify
themselves always that whatever they are
doing is the right thing in these modern
times when everybody is so cunning. This
cunningness can take you to the other Now there are various ways people

What is so special that we should live on

the Mahalakshmi principle is very-very, very
different from what people understand. They
think if they are seeking it should be
intelligible, it should be through their minds
or could be rational, all this or scientific.
That's how they move seeking the truth. It's
not possible. Mahalakshmi's principle is like
this, that you should have earnest desire to
know the truth and truth and truth and nothing

you start thinking that there must be
something better, there must be truth
beyond. Specially, people who have been
tortured by bad people always think like
get away from your awareness to achieve
that. Awareness is the most important thing.
If you can go into the realm of awareness
then you have to understand the basic
awareness is not to be lost. If your basic
awareness is lost through drinking or
through drugs or all these things that people
do. They think that they are seeking that's
why they are doing. So, sometimes they take
excuse of seeking to do wrong things. It's
like a revenge on yourself, I think, that you
want to revenge on yourself by thinking that
