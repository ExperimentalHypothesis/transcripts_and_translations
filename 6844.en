Surbiton ashram inauguration. Surbiton (UK), 17 July 1983.

... blessings to have such a nice place where we all can meet and do the work of God. Sahaja Yogis have to remember that we are here to do God's work and whatever blessings we get, these are just guidelines to know that God is creative.

I think the London Sahaja Yogis are real, really blessed ones, really blessed ones. The way they get one after another beautiful places to live in. And, we all should be very, very thankful for what God has been very kindly suggested to us.

I came here in the afternoon just to see the place. As I looked at these trees and the garden and the flowers - all of them are here specially, very specially to tell you that God is creative. We have to learn a lot through them: how they grow, how they expose themselves maximum to the rays of the sun, how they suck their nourishment - all this is a great training for all of us. They are absolutely entirely surrendered to God and to human beings who are the epitome of this civilization. So, it's such a big thing that we have a place which is unbelievably great and that we have to be very grateful. Count your blessings, count your blessings. There are still so many lost, so many who are going to be lost, but you are in the right path. This is sort of an advanced payment. [laughter]

It's so beautiful and so sweet but one has to know, as I told you before, that we are not going to stay in the ashram just to make our life convenient and leisurely. That's not the way we should look at things. If you have to live in the ashram, we have to discipline ourselves. You have to better yourself, everyday you have to rise. Certain rules and regulations of the ashram must be observed. There should be no idea of a democratic government where everybody has a right to vote and can demand what they want. On the contrary, it is the great privilege that you are supposed to enjoy the blessings. It's a great advantage for you that you are so fortunate to see these things with your eyes open, that God exists and He rewards. This understanding should give you more and more courage and complete willingness to improve yourself. This is the most important thing. Sahaja Yoga is of course as you know is for your transformation and an ashram is for your improvement. So, those people who are going to stay here or those who are going to visit here have to relatively see how they are improving and growing. There are many things which are going to come for us. They look material but they have an atmosphere of spirituality.

Try to settle down with yourself. Don't quarrel [It seems that Shri Mataji says someone's name but can't make it out] He wants you to be comfortable. After a month you'll get all the Sahaja Yogis who have to stay here. We'll sort it out and then they will be allowed to stay here. Till then we have to see what people are coming from abroad, they must also have proper places to live in. At the most a month, some people would like to stay here, but some of you will have to be here to look after them, to give them all your help. Those who have car, who have time, should come down here and start it out. We have to organize it on proper lines. There are three Sahaja Yogis are coming across the oceans, and one of them also to stay here. Try to make their stay comfortable. They are your brothers of great achievements, and we have to respect them and look after them. I'm happy we have here from America another great Sahaja Yogi. Try to help them. Whatever they need, whatever they want to do, they want to go out - make arrangements, make it easy. If they want a car or anything, try to help them.

Secondly, you must keep it clean, look after it. You have entered into another arena now, on another level where your own comforts should not be considered, it's the comfort of others. Now, you are at a giving stage. So, what are we going to give others, you have to see. Not what we are going to have "Oh this is not good, there's no hot water, there's this thing." - all you forget, you will not need anything.

So many will be pouring down. Who else has come for Guru Puja now? Apart from Herman.

You have come from where?

[A yogi speaks - inaudible]

Oh I see, good.

So, all those who are coming from anywhere else, you see, have to stay. And those people who want to look after them, you can have turns.

Now today is the ... what is the date today?

Yogi: Seventeenth.

Shri Mataji: All right! Modi is coming on the nineteenth, I believe. He's coming on nineteenth. Anybody who is going to organize here, food and all that ... Michael? Who else with you?

Is David? Where is David?

There he is. All right! So, I'll give you a check of thousand pounds which you can cash. Get all the ration and everything with some girls here.

I'm not going to pay. You have money in the bank. Now, don't get upset. I see some people frowning [laughter]

I'm not going to pay anymore now. Finished! All right. So, we have money in the bank and that money has to come handy now. So, about thousand pounds I would like to sanction.

And, David you. Michael. Who else is here?

All right. That's good. So four of you put together, you decide what you want to buy. And, some ladies you need here to help. Who will be here?

Kay?

Who else? Those who are free. You - two. Who else?

All right for the time being. Two of you and four of these boys. The rest of you should not shift here, should not stay here. But once, you see, these people are over, finished with it, then you can shift here. We'll see that. For now, we have two ladies who are willing to stay here and four gentlemen. All right? At least till the Guru Puja it'll be quite busy, I think, lots of people will be coming. So, some more ladies who can spare their time for these three-four days should also raise their hands, I think, these three-four days. All right? Who else?

What are you doing, Tanya?

Tanya: I'm working.

Shri Mataji: You are working, won't be free. All right. So about, say, three ladies are there.

So, three and four - seven people. Till the Guru Puja, we can manage somehow and then we'll see what happens.

Hello?

It's all right. It's all right. [inaudible] The children are [inaudible]

So, those who are already here ... who are those who are staying here?

You are staying here and who? John, you are there - four of you. Four. Five. Five of you are here. Six? Six of you. Who is in Chelsham Road now? What the girls are there? Michael you are not here?

[A yogi speaks - inaudible]

No, I think you come along. Till the Guru Puja, you see, you need here some people to really do the job. You may go to sleep there if there's no room, if there are too many people. I think we can manage.

Guru Puja is on the twenty-fourth only. So, hardly there are three-four days. I mean, when will you go to Guru Puja? Evening? Friday evening or Friday morning?

[Yogi responds - inaudible]

Friday? Friday. So, you see, hardly anytime. Today is what... let Me see... Monday, Tuesday... four-five days. All right. I may also shift Myself. If the servants are here - no problem. They will cook for Me.

But what the gas is working here?

[Yogi responds - inaudible]

Gas is not here. So, how do we cook?

[Yogi responds - gas has been disconnected downstairs... - inaudible]

Is it?

[Yogi responds - yes, I've had a look downstairs]

So, if you get the gas, then it's very easy. I can get the servants here. Then, I can shift Myself in a way. All right?

If there are say, five people - you five people and three ladies - they can cook for you, no problem, all of you. But gas you must have. Without gas they cannot manage. The water is running there? Hot and cold, both?

[Yogi responds - inaudible]

Just cold. So, how will you have hot water? Is there an arrangement?

[Yogi responds - inaudible]

All right. So, gas connection if you can get it tomorrow ... is it possible?

Yogi: Yes, I can get the gas connected as well as I can get the hot water running.

Shri Mataji: Without that how will you manage, I just can't understand.

Yogi: They'll have to do it tomorrow night.

Shri Mataji: Yes, of course! Is there an electric cooker here?

Yogi: No. We only got one electric kettle at the moment.

Shri Mataji: No, you have to have the gas. Otherwise it won't work out. If they connect it tomorrow, the servants can come and start cooking. In any case, I'll ask them to shift everything here, whatever is possible - vegetables and ghee and all that. Plus, I'll give you money to buy rice perhaps we may need.

So, about four people: gentlemen would be five and ladies would be three. Five and three - eight persons. All right.

As soon as the gas is connected, they can shift here. That's the point is. Gas must be connected. Otherwise, where will they cook? You see, there's no electrical cooker.

Yogini: Mother, I've got a smaller electric cooker - just two rings and smaller than oven. Perhaps it would be a start.

Shri Mataji: Start, we can!

Yogini: I've got it in the car actually.

Shri Mataji: Is it? [laughter]

Yogini: Because, we drove it from London to Brighton but we didn't unload it and so, we brought it all the way back but I couldn't understand why. [laughter]

Shri Mataji: Now, what do you say to that, [It seems that Shri Mataji says someone's name but can't make it out]. I was wondering how is she got the thing... [laughter]. So, we don't have to worry about anything whatsoever. But still we'll need gas thing, but for the time being it's good. All right, you shift it here.

[Yogi says something - inaudible.]

So, better do something with the gas also. All right? Because without the gas, so much cooking cannot be done. Partly, as she said. So, better unload the thing and put it down there.

[Yogi says something - inaudible.]

Gas, on your own?

Yogi: It will be better if we had a gas man there. [laughter]

Shri Mataji: You better go and tell them, "if you don't connect, we'll connect ourselves [laughter]." I tell you, so many beautiful things happening. So, we have to have that hot water started immediately as soon as the gas. So, tomorrow morning what time, John, you think you can do for the gas?

Yogi: nine o'clock

Shri Mataji: So, let him come here by nine o'clock? Then, you go ahead with him, and get the man and get it done. All right. Douglas, I know you can manage. Douglas is really a daring person. The way he has fought all the TM bhoots, you see, they're all literally frightened of him. [laughter]

You must see today's article in The Times. Did you read? Horrible article. Did you see the... My God! You must see that. He was very upset - David Proll. He came down and showed Me the article. It was horrible. They are already trying to advertise it and do all kinds of things and, there's somebody whom they have paid perhaps for writing. David can tell you. David, have you got the article?

[Yogi responds.]

So, we are going to work on that. Horrible article! He was very upset - David. [laughter]

All right, he is going to get the photocopy. Give it to Gavin. Give it to Gavin. Hold it with the prong. [laughter]

So shameless and so fraudulent! It's all falsehood they are talking; absolute falsehood. So many people are levitating. Their guru is levitating in the room. Everybody is levitating there, you see. All falsehood, they can disappear in thin air.

Yogi: It's all Your work, mother. [Everyone bursts into laughter]

And, seventeen thousand people are following... seventeen million or something.

Yogis: Three hundred million.

Shri Mataji: Three hundred million. All false. All, I tell you, all falsehood. But, I tell you, these media people don't understand what they are up to. One has to write something to them that this all is false. Very disastrous! Horrible!

Yogi: Media is skeptical of it ... enlightenment, world peace. They had to have metal detector when they went to their head quarter. [inaudible]

Shri Mataji: We have our own detector.

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Isn't it? With our detector we found that you are devils.

So, once we have this then it all came so fast. Isn't it? Doesn't matter. So, you arrange the first floor and the second floor for all the people who want to come. You keep the first floor for the ladies and the second for the men. All right? Not the other way round. Because there would be many who would be married with children. But most of them will be in Brighton - directly going to that. But Jason, have you been able to receive their information about when they are coming, how they are going, what place they want, how they want to be allotted?

Jason: Some of them, Mother, yes. We have the French people, most of them arriving on Saturday while some going directly to the place on Friday. The Swiss people are arriving about 3 o'clock Friday afternoon. I think also, the Italians are coming about that time. Phil Ward is in charge of organizing shuttle and cars to bring them from the station to the seminar. The Swiss people and probably the Italians also would like to stay here Sunday night because their flight goes on Monday.

Shri Mataji: Oh, that's [inaudible]. Also, you will be surprised that this is on your way to Brighton. So, even if they are coming earlier you can give this address to them so that they can come here first. And, from here you can take some sort of a bus or something to take all of them together.

Jason: Yes, Mother. There's a green bus that goes from Heathrow Airport to Gatwick Airport that goes almost right pass the door... [inaudible]

Shri Mataji: But why not make one place for them to meet first of all? Some of them are coming from the back doors also or what? Are they coming from the Brighton side?

Jason: Yes, Mother. Some of them. [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: But if they are coming on a Sunday here or something, why not they come here?

Jason: That will be after the Puja. [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: So how many will be here actually?

Jason: On Sunday night, probably about fifty or so.

Shri Mataji: Fifty here?

Jason: Just for the Sunday night but maybe there will be others ....[Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: All right. So, for Friday how many will be here?

Jason: Not sure... [Inaudible]

[Shri Mataji greets someone on the side]

Yogi: Three Italians are coming on Thursday night.

Shri Mataji: Thursday night?

Yogi: And Friday morning seven o'clock is arriving a group with ...

Shri Mataji: Friday morning?

Yogi: Friday morning. And they want to stay in the Ashram. I'll bring them here.

Shri Mataji: All right. So, keep it Thursday. Say so from ... it's going to be on. But I mean gas has to be there. As soon as gas is there I can shift here. No problem. But gas has to be here. I'll bring the servants also with Me.

But after the Puja, after the thing Sunday we should find out exactly how many people are coming here, because Sunday night food can be cooked here for them. Isn't it? And, they go on Monday morning?

Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: That's it. So, we can arrange that also. It could be arranged very clearly.

Nick, you have got this van till tomorrow?

Nick: Yes, Mother. I should be able to extend it. [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: All right. So tomorrow, why don't you send the van to Me?

Nick: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: All right. Then, we'll extend it. I'll pay for the extension.

Nick : There's no need for that, Mother.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. One day, I'll pay for it. All right? So, you send the van tomorrow to Me and then extend it. Hmm? Yes, tomorrow if you send Me the van, I can send Debbie, and if the gas is fixed, they can start cooking here. Even for... I mean you can cook for few people on that but ten people I don't know.

Yogini responds [Inaudble]

Shri Mataji: Best is to have the gas, you see.

He has given birth. Hello! He has given birth. I mean not he. [laughter] His wife has given birth to a baby boy and you know they had very bad time with the twins that they had. It's horrible. Tenants had an effect on the baby and the thing was delayed by about one week but the baby is very healthy - nine pound something and I have given him the name Janak - Janaka. I hope you are happy with the name. He's a very sweet baby. All right.

Now, those who are coming from outside like ... are you come from Northampton, Southampton? Who else? All of you. Where are you staying now? Where are you staying tonight? You'll go back? You won't come here? I mean, you are not going to stay till Guru Puja? You want to stay here?

[Yogi response inaudible]

All right. All right, you'll go back to Southampton and then you will come. So, how are you? How is your wife? Same? So, she is here or in Spain?

[Yogi response inaudible]

She is in Cambridge. How is the baby? He'll come round.

Boghdan, how are you? How is your wife?

So, for you four-five people who are staying here after getting the gas, you see - after getting the gas, again I say, you come and see Me tomorrow. Someone having any problem over here you better stay with Me for the time being till we get gas. What about his food? Let him in Chelsham Road, I think till then. If we get the gas tomorrow then there's no problem, you see. Then we will call you from Chelsham Road. All right? Let him be there at Chelsham Road. Who's at Chelsham Road now?

All right, Graham [We are not sure if Shri Mataji says Graham or not] you are organizing there. So, look after him. And, if we get the gas tomorrow then he can shift here. All right?

How are you? All right? You wrote a very nice letter to that man, that newspaper fellow. Horrible. Just imagine I never even asked anybody to take out the coat or anything. In general way I said you take out your coats. They have objection even for that. Can you meditate with your raincoat on you? Absurd, I tell you! How can these newspaper people be so stupid to write all that? I can't understand.

Yogini; Mother, sorry to interrupt You. There's been a very funny new development, because this horrible man's name has appeared in the newspaper again. In Brighton, this horrible nudist beach which makes us so sick, we heard some very good news. By Your Grace, they want to take away the nudist beach.

Shri Mataji: Nudist?

Yogini: The horrible naked beach they want to take away. But, the man who would not take off his shoes before You, has written to the newspaper saying "Nudist beach is very good, everyone should take out all their clothes."

Shri Mataji: Except for the raincoat! Look at this stupidity! [laughter] Now, what do you say to these real stupid people, you know.

Why not write a strong letter to editor of this?

[Yogi response inaudible]

Why do they give him so much importance? Who is he? He is the Managing Director of what company? Better...

[Yogi response inaudible]

Better write to them. All of you should do it. Stupid fellow! Stupid people live here, I tell you. What were you saying? John was telling Me something about you.

Yes, you communicated something to John? John, didn't you say?

[Yogi response inaudible]

Paste?

[Yogi response inaudible]

That is sandalwood paste to be made with a stone, that one. John, you know what he told Me he wants to know the name of the stone that is to sit on his head. [laughter]

I said, "Stone!" I mean I'm quite strange but not to that extent. [laughter]

I couldn't understand. I'm sorry for that. All right, this is the stone I was saying or any stone like this, anyone which you can rub. This is the thing - chandan, you can put it. [Shri Mataji talks in the side]

All right. So, with just this thing I said,that on the stone is I'm rubbing it. Show him that, Gavin.

Because of the heat, you see. Chandan is the best for heat. If you get blisters due to heat or anything - just rub this and put it on the thing - very good. Have you heard of any famous astrologer called M. K. Gandhi, anyone of you?

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Have you? I've never heard.

Yogi: I'm sure I've seen his advertisements.

Shri Mataji: He's telling others good things about Me.

That's Athena. Athena, now, what's happening? Now, slowly. What happened? One chana. I only had three of them just now. All right, how many do you want? As soon as I eat the chana, the Ganas are standing there. [laughter]

The Ganas are waiting to have some. That's their share. All right.

Now, we will have the puja and then we will have more chana. All right, sit down. It's all right.

[Yogi says something - inaudible]

Have you read the letter of Patrick?

What can I say? Very uncertain. Only good news is that one Mr. Marwah who was going to do all our publicity work has been elected as the Mayor, Mayor of Los Angeles. That's a very big news and this may do something good, I think. So, first I'm going to do all this in Los Angeles. Actually, I'll go to New York only to meet the Sahaja Yogis there. And, then I will... as the program is... you know the program, everything... I'm happy you could come because they are really worried about American tour. How they will take it, whether it will be successful or not? It will be!

Lets look at these nice Yogis people... just look at them. Not worse person has seen them levited. But they are telling all lies, you see. "There is very much better coordination of the body and the mind." Can you believe such a false story?

So, I told him that you should meet this Dr. Fredick or what was his name? Fredick? Ah, Frenny. You go and see him. Show him this article. You should say that we all want to protest. He himself will be very happy. That this is how he is going to cheat us, he is fraudulent. And, why not we all put together? Write a letter to the editor that, "You have no business to publicize such a person who has ruined the lives of so many."

Have you got that article of Madhu Dave... Madhu Jain?

[Yogi response inaudible.]

Activities in India... six thousand crores, ah? And, what David Proll told Me is this that so much has been written against him but there is no mention of it. So, you take David Proll, you and Frenny and all these people put together. Make a very strong letter about it and let Dr. Frenny put it in. And say, there are people here who can really... thousands of people who can say what I'm saying. Get hold of him.

The doctor friend of Rustom, did you contact him? John, did you give him the address of the doctor? Did you tell them about it? I think Pamela was there. Pamela?

[Pamela response inaudible]

What about that doctor? Did you tell him that he should come for the Puja? Then what did he say?

[Pamela response inaudible]

What did he say?

[Pamela response inaudible]

Hmm... See, all such like that Di, Lady Di or whoever she is... how is she now?

[Yogi response inaudible]

So, why not take her help also in writing. Now, you see, Warren is coming, all these people are coming - you can all put facts together. See this Dr. Frenny - all of you. And, tell him what he's doing and what sort of trouble he has given to others and how he has taken the money. You go and tell him very strongly. You, especially, we have to save others now. It's very important. Another thing he says that Atlanta someplace somewhere has all people have become very peaceful. Naturally, if you make somebody into a cabbage they will be. But the majority of the people, I mean the greater percentage of the people who are in Ireland and who are in Israel have become much more violent. One percent in Ireland and three percent in Israel. And, you see, how they are behaving. So, this Atlanta we cannot find out but what about these two places?

This Madhu... if you get his thing you can write down. He says that wherever his ashrams are nothing grows. Even the cows become barren. Or you can ask Murray how it was published. It was sent to us, I think.

Yogi: Murray has that?

Shri Mataji: Murray has that so ask Murray to help you there. All right? Now, one thing you can catch on him which you can play about to say that he is anti-Christ. Whatever he preaches is anti-Christ. Because he leads a life of licentiousness? himself and you can give the example of Linda's things that was written. She has written it down. Then he himself is making money out of us and has got all the material things of the world at the cost of his disciples. He is an anti-Christ and there is no relationship of his work with Christ, first of all. And, secondly you can also put Karpur Gaurav and all that are actually the worship of I think Shiva or something.

[Shri Mataji asks someone in Hindi is the Karpur Gaurav mantra is for Shivji or not.]

It is the Shiva's worship. So, what they tell them is the idol worship of Shiva - put it down. But because they don't know any Sanskrit they go on saying. All right? Modi will be coming, he will give you the complete shloka. It's Shiva's worship. So, that will go in the Christian mind here.

Then, another good news is: Rustom has said that in the Koran there is a description of Kundalini. They call it Assas and that at the resurrection time, the Kundalini will be awakened by Mahdi. It's all there. So many things in the Koran, he was saying that there are seven heavens, firmaments, through which human beings has to pass, one has to ascend through this.

But I was reading a book given to Me by one of the Sahaja Yogis in Brighton. It's very clearly said in that there are angels of the Mother and angels of the heavens and then seven of them and seven of these and everything. And, according to My calculation it is describing Monday as the sabbath - Monday. Because as you go you see, the Creator is on the third day or second day. It should be on the third day. It's the second day. First is the angel of the joy. And, that is Shiva. So, it is Monday. Like that. Very clearly. And it is all written down, it's preserved, and they have just taken it out and translated. Can you imagine? We have got now the scriptures to go with. Those books are with Me - two of them. Can you get those books for Me, from some shop? *

Who gave Me that book? You gave Me, yes!

[Yogi response inaudible]

Only through your University?

[Yogi response inaudible]

You can? So, can you, two-three people buy that and go through it. And, you'll be amazed. I mean, that's the real Bible, you can say, about Christ. Even the Bible, which is written now about the ten commandments, everything this is related. Because that's the original one they found Out. Can you imagine? And, these laws that were written in Bible at the time of Moses, which are called Shariat in the Islamic religion, are because the people had become so bad, so bad that they had to put such terrible, strict laws that anybody does that must be cut - his throat must be cut, his hands must be cut, legs must be cut. All this is only because of these things happening in those days. The people were so bad, so much on the decline that they had to change all that and they started this. This is very clearly written there. Better get those two books and prepare it in that line. It will be good idea.

All right. You want to wash My feet? This water - you can wash My feet. You go around and put everywhere here. Shining these days a bit too much. You see, when we went to Malmo, I said seven mantras for the sun and the sun came out. And since that day it's beautiful. All right.

Can you wash My feet?

*Bibliographical note:
The two books mentioned are likely to be from the Essene Gospel of Peace series, translated from the Hebrew and Aramaic texts by Edmund Bordeaux Szekely (San Diego: Academy Books, 1974; International Biogenic Society, 1981]. The reference to 'angels of the Mother' and 'angels of the Father' is probably to Book Two.  (John Noyce)
