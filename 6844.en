Surbiton ashram inauguration. Surbiton (UK), 17 July 1983.

Shri Mataji: What a blessing.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother, is.

Shri Mataji:  Ah, come along. What a place! Is it going to be a big Puja here or a small one? Yes, I wanted to have a very small one. All right, please be seated. So how are you? The ladies, come along, sit down here. It is such a blessing to have such a nice place, where we all can meet, and do the work of God. Sahaja Yogis have to remember that you are here to do God's work. And whatever blessings you get, these are just guidelines to know that God is pleased with you. I think the London Sahaja Yogis are real, really blessed ones, real blessed ones, the way they got one after another beautiful places to live in. And, we all should be very, very thankful for what God has been very kindly suggesting to us.
I came here in the afternoon just to see the place, and I looked at these trees and this garden and the flowers. All of them are here specially, very specially, to tell you that God is pleased with you. We have to learn a lot with them, how they grow, how they expose themselves maximum to the rays of the sun, how they suck their nourishment, all this, is a great training for all of us. They are absolutely entirely surrendered to God, and to human beings, who are the epitome of this evolution. So, it's such a big thing that we have a place which is unbelievably great and that we have to be very grateful. Count your blessings, count your blessings. There are still so many lost, so many who are going to be lost, but you are in the right path. This is sort of an advanced payment. It's so beautiful and so sweet. but one has to know, as I told you before, that we are not going to stay in the ashram just to make a life convenient and leisurely. That's not the way we should look at things. If we have to live in the ashram, we have to discipline ourselves. You have to better, better yourself, Everyday you have to rise. Certain rules and regulations of the ashram must be observed. There should be no idea of a democratic government where everybody has a right to vote and can demand what they want. On the contrary, it is the great privilege that you are supposed to enjoy the blessings. It's a great advantage for you, that you are so fortunate, to see these things with your eyes open, that God exists and He rewards. This understanding should give you more and more courage, and complete willingness to improve yourself. This is the most important thing. Sahaja Yoga is of course as you know, is for your transformation and an ashram is for your improvement. So those people who are going to stay here or those who are going to visit here have to relatively see how they are improving and growing. There are many things which are going to come for us. They look material but they have an atmosphere of spirituality.
Try to settle down with yourself. Don't quarrel with yourself. He wants you to be comfortable. After a month we'll get all the Sahaja Yogis who have to stay here, we'll sort it out and then they will be allowed to stay here. Till then we have to see what people are coming from abroad, they must also have proper places to live in. At the most a month, some people would like to stay here, but some of you will have to be here to look after them, to give them all your help. Those who have car, who have time, should come down here and start it out We have to organize it on proper lines. There are three Sahaja Yogis are coming across the oceans. I want them also to stay here. Try to make their stay comfortable. They are your brothers of great achievements, and we have to respect them and look after them. I'm happy we have here from America another great Sahaja Yogi. Try to help them. Whatever they need, whatever they want to do, they want to go out, make arrangements, make it easy. If they want a car or anything, try to help them.
Secondly, you must keep it clean, look after it. We have entered into another arena now and another level where your own comfort should not be considered. It's the comfort of others. Now, you are at a giving stage. So, what are we going to give others, we have to see. Not what we are going to have, "Oh this is not good there's no hot water, there's this thing." All you forget, you will not need anything.
So many will be pouring down. Who else has come for Guru Puja now? Apart from Herman?
Shri Mataji: You have come?
Sahaja Yogi: From France.
Shri Mataji: From where?
Sahaja Yogi: From France. France? Oh, I see, good.
So, all those who are coming from anywhere else, you see, have to stay here. And those people who want to look after them, you can have turns.
Now today is the, what is the date today?
Sahaja Yogi: 17-th July. SMi: All right! Modi is coming on the 19th, I believe. He's coming 19-th. Anybody who is going to organize here, food and all that Michael? Who else with you?
Is David? Where is David? David, all right. So, I'll give you a cheque of 1000 pounds which you can cash, get all the ration and everything with some girls here, who are not... I'm not going to pay. We have money in the bank. Now, don't get upset. I see some people permanent... I'm not going to pay anymore now. Finished! All right. So, we have money in the bank and that money has to come handy now. So about thousand pounds, I would like to sanction.
And, David, you, Michael, who else is here?
All right. That's good. So four of you put together, you decide what you want to buy. And, some ladies you need here to help you. Who will be here?
Kay?
Who else? Those who are free. You, two. Who else?
All right for the time being. Two of you, and four of these boys. The rest of you should not shift here, should not stay here. But once, you see, these people are over, finished with it, then you can shift here. We'll see that. So now we have two ladies who are willing to stay here, and four gentlemen. All right? At least till the Guru Puja we'll be quite busy, I think. Lots of people will be coming. So, some more ladies who can spare their time for these 3-4 days should also raise their hands, I think. These 3-4 days. All right? Who else?
What are you doing, Tania?
Sahaja Yogi: I'm working Mother.
Shri Mataji: You are working. Won't be free. All right. So about, say, three ladies are there.
So, three and four - seven people. Till the Guru Puja, we can manage somehow and then we'll see about it. Hello It's all right. It's all right. The children are [inaudible]
. So, those who are already here... Who are those who are staying here?
You are staying here? Or who, John, you are there, four of you. So it's five. Five of you are here. Six? Nick. Six of you. Who is in Chelsham Road now? All the girls are there? Michael you are not here?
Sahaja Yogi: Not yet, Mother. Not yet, Mother. [unclear] four people to [manage it].
Sahaja Yogi: Nicholas, John, Alan and someone else, David. No, I think you come along. Till the Guru Puja, you see, you need here, some people to really do the job. You may go to sleep there if there's no room, if there are too many people. But I think we can manage.
Guru Puja is on the 24th only. So, hardly there are 3-4 days, I mean. When will you go to Guru Puja? Evening?
Sahaja Yogi: Friday, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Friday evening or Friday morning? Most people go Friday at midday.
Shri Mataji: Friday?
Sahaja Yogi: Middle of the day Friday.
Shri Mataji: Friday.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. So, you see, hardly anytime. Today is... Tuesday, Monday, four or five days. Four-five days. All right. I may also shift Myself. If the servants are here, no problem, they'll cook for you. But what, the gas is working here?
Sahaja Yogi: Not yet, Mother. Not the gas here. We got electricity there. But gas is not here. So, how do we cook? Mother, actually the gas has been disconnected downstairs, for safety reasons. So if we ask a gas [bottle] or if we use perhaps a little coercion they will come and connect it on 25-th.
Shri Mataji: Is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I've had a look downstairs. So, if you get the gas, then it's very easy. I can get the servants here. And I can shift Myself in a way. All right?
If there are say, five people, and you five people and three ladies, eight ladies, they can cook for you, no problem, all of you. But gas you must have, without gas they cannot manage. The water is running there? Hot and cold, both?
Sahaja Yogi: Not, not, just cold.
Shri Mataji: Just cold. So, how will you have hot water? Is there an arrangement?
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, the only way they'll get hot watter at the moment, is to get the gas connected As soon as the gas is connected, there is an oil boiler, and there's a gas boiler downstairs, in the basement. All right. So, gas connection if you can get it tomorrow, is it possible?
Sahaja Yogi: We'll do our best, Mother. If they can, if they can get the gas connected, otherwise we can't get the hot water running. Without that how will you manage? I just can't understand.
Sahaja Yogi: But, they'll have to connect it tomorrow. They'll have to do it tomorrow Mother.
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course! Is there any electric cooker here?
Sahaja Yogi: No. We only got one electric kettle at the moment. o.k. No, you have to have the gas otherwise it won't work out. If they connect it tomorrow, the servants can come and start cooking. In any case, I'll ask them to shift everything here, whatever is possible, vegetables and ghee and all that. Plus, I'll give you money to buy, rice perhaps we may need and something. So, about four people, gentlemen will be five and ladies will be three. Five and three, eight persons. All right.
As soon as the gas is connected, they can shift here. That's the point is. The gas must be connected. Otherwise, where will they cook? You see, there's no electrical cooker.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, I've got a small electric cooker, just two rings and a small little oven. Perhaps it would be a start.
Shri Mataji: Start with, yes!
Sahaja Yogi: I've got it in the car actually.
Shri Mataji: Is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Because, we drove it from London to Brighton but we didn't unload it. so we brought it all the way back again, but I couldn't understand why. Now, what do you say to that, Gavin? I was wondering how is she's got the thing. So, we don't have to worry about anything whatsoever. But still we'll need gas thing. But for, for the time being it's good. All right, you shift it here, we'll....
Sahaja Yogi: But Mother the electricity was a miracle as well, because they were supposed to check all the circuits, before they connected us up, but the chap was very nice and he came yesterday and he just looked around and he said all it`s all right and he turned it on. So, better do something with the gas also. All right? Because without the gas, so much cooking cannot be done, but partly, as she said. So, better unload the thing and put it down there.
Sahaja Yogi: I think perhaps I could turn the gas on tomorrow. Gas? On your own?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, but it will be better if we had a gas man there. You better go and tell them, "If you don't connect, we'll connect ourselves". I tell you, so many beautiful things happening. So, we have to have that hot water, will start immediately as soon as the gas... All right.
Sahaja Yogi: I'll come tomorrow. So, tomorrow morning what time, John, you think you can do for the gas?
Sahaja Yogi: Well we'll start at, whatever, nine o'clock, when they open. So, let him come here by nine o'clock? And then you go ahead with him, and get the man and get it done. All right? Douglas, I know you can manage. Douglas is really a daring person. The way he has fought all the TM bhoots, you see, they're all literally frightened of him. You must see today's article in The Times. Did you read? Horrible article. Did you see them? Oh, God! You must see that. He was very upset, David Prall. He came down and showed Me the article. It was horrible. They are already trying to advertise it and do all kinds of things and, there's somebody whom they have paid perhaps, he's writing. David, David can tell you. David, have you got the article?
Sahaja Yogi: I'm [unclear] on that. Not at all. So, we are going to work on that. Horrible article! He was very upset, David. I'll get it photocopied. All right, he is going to get the photocopy. Give it to Gavin. Give it to Gavin. Hold it with the prong. So [practical]. So shameless and so fraudulent! It's all falsehood they are talking, absolute falsehood. So many people are levitating. Their guru is levitating in the room. Everybody is levitating there, you see. All falsehood; they can disappear in thin air.
Sahaja Yogi: I wish they would, Mother. And, seventeen thousand people are following, seventeen million or something.
Sahaja Yogi: Three hundred millions.
Shri Mataji: Three hundred million. All false.
Sahaja Yogi: That's about one and a half [world], isn't it Mother? All, I tell you, all falsehood. But, I tell you, these media people don't understand what they are up to. One has to write something to them, that this is all false. Very disastrous! Horrible! But the media was skeptical Mother. In the article they said, that even in spite of his enlightenment to the world peace they had a battle detector when he went into their head quarters, to protect him. Shri Mataji: We have our own detectors. Isn't it? With our detector we found that you are devils.
So once we have this, then, it's all came so fast, isn't it? Doesn't matter. So you arrange the first floor and the second floor for all the people who want to come. You keep the first floor for the ladies, and the second for the men. All right? Not the other way round. Because there would be many who would be married with children. But most of them will be in Brighton, directly going to that. But Jason, have you been able to receive their information about when they are coming, how they are going, what place they want, how they want to be allotted?
Sahaja Yogi: Some of them, Mother, yes. We know the, the French people are mostly arriving Saturday, with some going directly to the place Friday. And the Swiss people are arriving about 3 o'clock, Friday afternoon. And I think also the Italians are coming at that time. And Phil was in this, in charge of organizing a shuttle and cars to bring them from Pulborough station to the seminar. The Swiss people and the, probably the Italians also would like to stay here Sunday night because their flight goes back on Monday.
Shri Mataji: Oh, that's whole arrangement for them. Also, you will be surprised, this is on your way to Brighton.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. So, even if they are coming earlier you can give this address to them.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes Mother.
Shri Mataji: So that they can come here first. And, from here you can take some sort of a bus or something to take all of them together.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. There's a green bus that goes from Heathrow Airport to Gatwick Airport, that goes right past, well, almost right past the door, so they can all get on that. But also, Mother, we may have through the University, two dormobile wagons, to sleep twelve people each, so we'll probably have those on the, on the Thursday as well. But why not make one place for them to meet, first of all? Some of them are coming from the back doors also or what? Are they coming from the Brighton side? Yes Mother, some of them, some of the Belgians are arriving tomorrow or Tuesday, in Brighton, and they've asked to stay with us in Brighton, So we've just opened the Pamela's house, so we can house them there. There's a family of people from Belgium coming. I think that's all the ones I know about Mother. I haven't yet been contacted by the others, but mostly there are... But if they are coming on a Sunday here or something, why not they come here?
Sahaja Yogi:That will be after the Puja Mother, when they come here.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. So how many will be here actually? On Sunday night, probably about fifty or something Mother.
Shri Mataji: Fifty, here?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, just for the Sunday night, but maybe there will be others who will stay longer as well Mother, I don't know yet. All right. So, for Friday how many will be here?
Sahaja Yogi: Not so many, Mother. I think most of them are going straight to the seminar. [unclear] with most of them.
Sahaja Yogi: The Italians are coming,
Sahaja Yogi: Are you cold Mother?
Shri Mataji: It's all right. Thank you. Hello, Ambika, how are you, how are you?
Sahaja Yogi: Friday morning and they will stay here during the day.
Sahaja Yogi: Three are coming Friday, Thursday night. Three Italians are coming Thursday night.
Shri Mataji: Thursday night?
Sahaja Yogi: And Friday morning at 7 o'clock is arriving a group with big...
Shri Mataji: Friday morning?
Sahaja Yogi: Friday morning. And they want to stay in the ashram. So then I'll bring them here.
Shri Mataji: All right, so keep it Thursday, say so from, it's going to be on. But I mean gas has to be there. As soon as gas is there I can shift here, no problem. But gas has to be here. I'll bring the servants also with Me.
But after the Puja, after the thing, Sunday, we should find out exactly how many people are coming here, because Sunday night food can be cooked here for them, isn't it?
Shri Mataji: And, they go on Monday morning?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. That's it. So, we can arrange that also. It could be arranged, very clearly.
Nick, you have got this van till tomorrow?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. I should be able to extend it. I can phone them.
Shri Mataji: All right. So tomorrow, why don't you send the van to Me?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, of course.
Shri Mataji: All right. Then, we'll extend it, and I'll pay for the extension.
Sahaja Yogi: No, there's no need for that, Mother.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. One day, I'll pay for it. All right? So, you send the van tomorrow to Me and then extend it.
Sahaja Yogi: O.k. For one day? Yes, tomorrow if you send Me the van, I can send Debbie here, and if the gas is fixed, they can start cooking here. Even for... I mean you can cook for few people on that, but ten people I don't know.
Sahaja Yogi: Only for a start I would say Mother, because it's small, just 2 rings, but it's....
Shri Mataji: Best is to have the gas, you see. So tomorrow you send the van to Me, morning time.
Shri Mataji: You drive the van?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Then you will come along?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. All right. And also those three cupboards you have got of Mine,
Sahaja Yogi: We've got a large wardrobe, Mother. A large wardrobe, a dressing table, a suite. I think bring them here, because there is no furniture here. [I'll do all that] Mother. All right, you better bring all that here. Anything special? What is it? So the good news is that James has given birth Hello. He has given birth. I mean not he. His wife has given birth to a baby boy. And you know they had very bad time with the twins that they had, and it's horrible. [Tenseness] had an effect on the lady and the thing was delayed by about one week. But the baby is very healthy, nine pounds something and I have given him the name Janaka, Janaka. I hope you are happy with the name. He's a very sweet baby. All right.
Now, those who are coming from outside, like, ah, you have come from Northampton, Southampton?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, she is there.
Shri Mataji: Who else?
Sahaja Yogi: Just Lucy and there are others. All of you. Where are you staying now? In Southampton, Mother. In Southampton. But where are you staying today, tonight?
Sahaja Yogi: In Southampton.
Shri Mataji: You'll go back? Yes. Mother. You want to come here? I mean, you are not going to stay till Guru Puja?
Sahaja Yogi: The Guru Puja, next week, yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: You want to stay here?
Sahaja Yogi: No, actually we are staying at, where the seminar is taking place.
Shri Mataji: I can't hear.
Sahaja Yogi: No, he is saying they will go back tonight, Mother, and then they will come for Guru Puja to the place. All right. All right. You'll go back to Southampton and then you will come. So, how are you?
Sahaja Yogi: Very well, Mother.
Shri Mataji: How is your wife?
Sahaja Yogi: Same, Mother. Same? So, she is here or in Spain?
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, she's in Cambridge, Mother. She's in Cambridge.
Shri Mataji: She's in Cambridge.
Sahaja Yogi: With the baby.
Shri Mataji: How is the baby?
Sahaja Yogi: He's very well Mother. She'll come round.
Shri Mataji: Bogdan, how are you?
Sahaja Yogi: I'm fine.
Shri Mataji: How is your wife?

Sahaja Yogi: [Good]. So, for you four-five people who are staying here, after getting the gas, you see, after getting the gas, again I say, you come and see Me tomorrow. I mean have you any problem over here, you better stay with Me for the time being, is it, till we get a gas. What about his food? Let him in Chelsham Road, I think then, till then. If we get the gas tomorrow then there's no problem, you see. Then we we'll call him from Chelsham Road, all right? Let him be there at Chelsham Road. Who's at Chelsham Road now?
Sahaja Yogi: Graham.
Shri Mataji: All right, so Graham, you are organizing there, so you look after him, and if we get the gas tomorrow then he can shift here. All right?
How are you? John? All right? You wrote a very nice letter to that man, that newspaper fellow. Horrible. Just imagine I never even asked anybody, to take out the coat or anything. In general way I said you take out your coats. They have objection even for that? Can you meditate with your raincoat on you? Only absurd, I tell you, and how can these newspaper people be so stupid to write all that, I can't understand.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother...
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, sorry to interrupt You. There's been a very funny new development, because this horrible man's name has appeared in the newspaper again. There's a, in Brighton, there's a horrible nudist beach, which makes us so sick. We heard some very good news, by Your grace. It looks...
Shri Mataji: What is that?
Sahaja Yogi: They want to take away the nudist beach.
Shri Mataji: Nudist?
Sahaja Yogi: The horrible naked beach, they want to take away. But, the man who would not take off his shoes before You, has written to the newspaper saying "Nudist beach is very good, everyone should take out all their clothes."
Shri Mataji: Except for the raincoat! Look at this stupidity! Now, what do you say to this? Real stupid people, you know.
When we recognized the name and address, we were just screaming. Why not write a strong letter to the editor of this? Other way, we can take these complains through the Press Council [unclear]. So she will say to them what a stupid matter. And why do they give him so much importance? Who is he? He is the Managing Director of what company? Better...
Shri Mataji: What's it?
Sahaja Yogi: [New Times] newspaper, yes. Probably the Managing Director. Yes, because we were looking in the newspaper for his name, perhaps a vault of lightening or something. Better write to them. All of you should do it. Stupid fellow! Such stupid people live here, I tell you. What were you saying? John was telling Me something about you.
Yes? You communicated something to John?
Shri Mataji: John, didn't you say?
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, yes.
Sahaja Yogi: You were talking to me about the paste, to put on my head.
Shri Mataji: Paste?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: It's only a stone first time, then second time...
Sahaja Yogi: Then you needed a stone to rub it, to make a paste, to get it stoned. That is sandalwood paste to be made with a stone, that one is there. John, you know what he told Me, he wants to know the name of the stone that is to be put on his head. I said, "Stone! I don't think." I mean I'm quite strange but not to that extent. I couldn't understand anything. I'm sorry for that. All right, this is the stone I was saying. Any stone like this, anyone, which you can rub. You see, this is the thing, is chandan, you can put it. Gavin, now, this is a regular Puja, is it? I`ll wash My hands, if you don't mind, with this. All right, come along. Let's finish it off, the Puja part. All right? So, this, just this thing I said, that on the stone you can rub it. Show him that, Gavin.
Because of the heat, you see. Chandan is the best for heat. If you get blisters due to heat or anything, just rub this and put it on the thing, is very good. Have you heard of any famous astrologer called M. K. Gandhi, anyone of you?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it is. Yes.
Shri Mataji: Have you? I've never heard.

Sahaja Yogi: Is he good Mother?
Sahaja Yogi: I don't know if he is good.
Shri Mataji: I don't know, is he? Yogi:
Sahaja Yogi: I think he is commercial.
Shri Mataji: He's what?
Sahaja Yogi: One of these commercial people. He tells your fortune.
Shri Mataji: He is... Who told Me? I'm sure I've seen his advertisements. He is telling others good things about Me.
That's, that's Athena? Athena, now, what's happening? Slowly. What happened? One chana. I only had three of them just now. All right, how many you want? As soon as I eat the chana, the Ganas are standing there. The Ganas are waiting to have some. That's their share. All right, for you also. All right. You have. Now have these. All right, now will have the Puja, and then we'll have more chana, all right? Sit down. It`s all right.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, we're just starting this issue "From the Heart", for America, especially for America. And I was wondering if there's any particular thing you want us to do for that.
Shri Mataji: Any particular? Any particular aspect, anything special You want us to put in.
Shri Mataji: About what?
Sahaja Yogi: "From the Heart", the magazine "From the Heart", for America
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, this is a special issue Mother. I will read the letter of Patrick. What can I say? Very uncertain. Only good news is the one Mr. Dr. [Marwah], who was going to do all our publicity work has been elected as the Mayor, Mayor of Los Angeles. That's a very big news. And this may do something good, I think. So, first I'm going to do all this in Los Angeles. Actually, I'll go to New York only to meet the Sahaja Yogis there. And, then I will, as the program is...
Shri Mataji: You know the program.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Everything.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. I'm happy you could come because we are really worried about American tour, how they will take it, whether it will be successful or not.
Shri Mataji: It will be. But look at these Mahesh Yogi's people and all. Just think of it. Not worst person has seen them levitating. But they are telling all lies, you see, and "there is very much better coordination of the body and the mind." Can you believe such a false story?
So, I told him that you should meet this doctor Frenick, or what was his name? Frenick?
Sahaja Yogi: Frenny. Ah, Frenny. You go and see him. Show him this article. You should say that "We all want to protest". You see, he himself will be very happy, that this is how he is going to cheat us. He is fraudulent. And why not we all put together, write a letter to the editor that, "You have no business to publish such a person who has ruined the lives of so many people." Have you got that article of [Madhu, Madhu Dhave]? [Madhu Jain].
Sahaja Yogi: About his, all his...
Shri Mataji: activities in India, six thousand crores?
Sahaja Yogi: I don't think he's got it now. And what David Praul told Me is this, that so much has been written against him, but there is no, no mention of it. So, you take David Praul, you and [Frenny] and all these people put together, make a very strong letter about it and let Dr. [Frenny] put it in. And he said there are people here who can really, who can, thousands of people who can say what I am saying. You get hold of him.
The doctor, friend of Rustom, did you contact him? John, did you give him the address of the doctor?
Sahaja Yogi: No, I've got the number with me. I'll have to make a note of the thing. Did you tell them about it? I said that, I think Pamela was there. Pamela? Mother?
Shri Mataji: What is? What about that doctor?
Sahaja Yogi: Brian Wells. Yes, he's in London. Did you tell him that he should come for the Puja?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Then what did he say?
Sahaja Yogi: He said, he might be on duty on that day and he wasn't sure. What did he say?
Sahaja Yogi: He said he was on duty [when You came] and he couldn't come. He wasn't sure, he was going to try to change his duty. See, all such like that Di, Lady Dee or whosoever she is... She, how is she now?
Sahaja Yogi: I think she is much better. She, I haven't seen her since I saw You the last time, but, I'll give her a phone. I think she wants to come to the seminar. So, why not take her help also in writing. Now, you see, Warren is coming, all these people are coming, you can all put facts together. See this Dr. Frenny, all of you, And, tell him what he is doing, and what sort of trouble he has given to others and how he has taken the money. You go and tell him very strongly. Especially, we have to save others now. It's very important. Another thing he says, that Atlanta some place, somewhere, all people have become very peaceful. Naturally, if you make somebody into a cabbage, they will be. But the majority of the people, I mean the greater percentage of the people, who are in Ireland, and who are in Israel, have become much more violent. Three percent in Ireland, and one percent, one percent in Ireland and three percent in Israel. And, you see, how they are behaving. So this Atlanta we cannot find out but what about these two places? And this Madhu has, if you get his things you can write down. He says that wherever his ashrams are, nothing grows. Even the cows become barren. Just try to see if you have got that one. Or you can ask Marie how it was published. it was sent to us, I think.
Sahaja Yogi: But I can't [remember] how it came to us. I think Marie did it. I think Marie has the original. Marie has that article? Shri Mataji: so ask Marie to help you there, all right? Now, one thing you can catch on it, which you can play about, to say that he is anti-Christ. Whatever he preaches, he's an anti-Christ. Because he leads a life of licentiousness himself. And you can give the example of Linda's things, that was written. She has written it down. Then he himself is making money out of us, and has got all the material things of the world, at the cost of his disciples. He is an anti-Christ. And there is no relationship of his work with Christ, first of all. And, secondly you can also put Mr. Karpur Gaurav, all that, are actually at the worship of, I think Shiva or something. Karpur Gaurav, what is the thing in? [Hindi or Marathi] [Hindi or Marathi] [Hindi or Marathi] [Hindi or Marathi] It is the Shiva's this thing, worship. So what they tell them is the Puja, is the idol worship of Shiva. Put it down there. But because they don't know any Sanskrit they go on saying. All right? Modi will be coming, he'll give you the complete shloka. It's a, it's Shiva's worship. So, that will go into the Christian mind here.
Then, another good news is, Rustom has said that in the Quran, there is a description of Kundalini. They call it Assas. And that at the resurrection time, the Kundalini will be awakened by Mahdi. It's all there. So many things in the Quran, he was saying, that there are seven heavens, firmaments, through which human beings has to pass. One has to ascend through those. But I was reading a book given to Me, by one of the Sahaja Yogis from Brighton. It's very clearly said in that Essesen or something, Essene, Essenes. that there are angels of the Mother and angels of the heavens, and then seven of them and seven of these and everything, and there according to My calculation it is they are describing Monday as the sabbath day, Monday. Because as you go, you see, the Creator is on the third day or second day. It should be in the third day. It's the second day. The first is the, is the angel of the joy. And, that is Shiva. So, it is Monday. Like that. Very clearly day. And it is all written down, it's preserved, and they have just taken it out and translated it. Can you imagine? Means we have got now the Scriptures to quote. Those books are with Me, two of them. Can you get those books Gavin, from some shop? Essenes. Who game Me that book? You gave Me, yes!
Sahaja Yogi: You can get it. There are lots of them. We can get them quite easily. We can order it through a University book shop.
Shri Mataji: Only through the University?
Sahaja Yogi: Or we can get in other book shops.
Shri Mataji: You can? So, can you, two-three people buy that and go through it. and you'll be amazed, I mean, that's the, that's the real Bible, we can say, about Christ. Even the Bible, which is written now about the ten commandments. Everything they say is mutilated. Because that's the original one they found out. Can you imagine? And these laws that were written in the Bible, at the time of Moses, which are called Shariat in the Islamic religion, are because the people had become so bad, so bad, that they had to put such terrible, strict laws that anybody does that must be cut. His throat must be cut, his hands must be cut, leg must be cut. All this is only because of these things happening. In those days, the people were so bad, so much on the decline, that they had to change all that and they started this. This is very clearly written there. Better get those two books and prepare it, in that line. It will be good idea.
All right, so let's have it. You want to wash My feet? This water when you wash My feet, you go round and put everywhere here. The sun is shining these days a bit too much. You see, when we went to Malmo, I said seven mantras for the sun and the sun came out. And since that day it's beautiful.
Shri Mataji: All right.

Sahaja Yogi: Thank you, Mother. Can you all wash My feet?

Let's have [unclear] to do it. Gavin, come and wash it now. Just pour it. Just rub it. Pour it. Put some music if you have. Douglas, you have some music here? No?
Sahaja Yogi: Some other Sahaja Yogis, Mother, will get it.
Sahaja Yogi: If I haven't and don't get it, I'll play it.
Sahaja Yogi: David, they will play. Some [unclear] will be better.
Sahaja Yogi: Someone arrived carrying a musical instrument.
Sahaja Yogi: Perhaps they might play.
Shri Mataji: It's all right. These are three flats. Where they were? Just the same as, three.
Sahaja Yogi: At [unclear] there are five.
Shri Mataji: Five flats?
Sahaja Yogi: They are going to make seven, I think, Mother. They are going to make seven flats.
Sahaja Yogi: They are going to make 7 flats.
Shri Mataji: But already there are how many flats?
Sahaja Yogi: Three. Three dorms and kitchen. It's about three kitchen. Three. Three. It's three plus. It's good. Now keep this water and you can put it in there, or anywhere, but then you have to take it all round and put it down, this water. Can you wipe My Feet? There's something dry rot in the ground floor. Who can cure that?
Sahaja Yogi: The wood will need replacing.
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon.
Sahaja Yogi: The wood will need replacing.
Shri Mataji: Wood we are replacing?
Sahaja Yogi: Just because....
Shri Mataji: All right, so somebody has to do it, someone who knows the job. Dora? Will you have a look at it, what sort of thing it is, just now. Right? And I mean before we'll go. And tomorrow you get some wood and put it down there. Ross put it all around. All right? It`s good. I would suggest that some of it can be.... This Poornima is? Guru Poornima when is, 24-th? Yes, Shri Mataji, Sunday. One week after. The moon is very small, still.
Shri Mataji: One week more, half.
Sahaja Yogi: We began with even less one.
Shri Mataji: Half moon. I'm washing My hands, you all can say your mantras when I'm washing My hands. Good idea. Let's have it. Also keep this water for the trees and things like that, for the flowers. You can mix it up. You put some more water, I think. All these things can be cleaned very easily, if you use a little bit of tamarind. Tamarind you rub it, keep it for a while [Hindi or Marathi] And immediately you must wash it after that. All this black will go away. Start it with ghee. See, Gavin, I have one, I was telling you. So, you get something better. You can hold it in the hands. So is that the blue colored one?
Sahaja Yogi: He is going to inquire, Mother, [of the spectrum] again.
Shri Mataji: Blue.
Sahaja Yogi: He found one [unclear], one carat, but it was a yellow color. He said so.
Shri Mataji: Yellow you should not. Tell him money doesn't matter. Get a blue one. Yellow is not good. How is it he couldn't find there? No, only because of the money, Mother. The only thing was the budget.
Shri Mataji: Money part.
Sahaja Yogi: We can give him on Monday.
Shri Mataji: Yes, we'll send him.
Shri Mataji: Or in London you can get one.
Sahaja Yogi: Maybe, Mother. Let's be optimistic. All right. So somebody will be there in charge of music and everything? Somebody who has to take music records and things like that? The other day Lata Mangeshkar came to see Me, and I gave her realization and I, I cured her, of her spondilitis and she sent Me a record. She said she has seen My photograph in Cambridge, and she knows about Me. How did you get the milk here?
Sahaja Yogi: Look out, Mother.
Shri Mataji: You get milk? You have asked the milkman to bring the milk and all that? So better get the milkman, gas... What else?
Sahaja Yogi: To get this bin, Mother. Is the garbage can we have to clean.
Shri Mataji: The garbage cleaner.
Shri Mataji: Garbage tins, have you got garbage tins here?
Sahaja Yogi: Not yet, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Not yet?
Sahaja Yogi: We've been using big plastic bags so far.
Shri Mataji: All right. All right. So these three things tomorrow you have to get. All right? And Nick you come along, I'll give you the money, cash. Now, some... What else is there? Not all that, is too much. Half of it. That's all. Now the sugar. Say the mantras and something. 108 Names you can say. Look at the sky. There will be a thunderstorm maybe, to announce the Guru Puja. Now, some water. She got little [unclear]. More sugar is there?
Sahaja Yogi: It must be the sugar right to the back.
Shri Mataji: A little bit, if it is there. It's all right I can get with the water. All right, with the water. That will do, I think. More water will be needed, that's it.
Sahaja Yogi: Some ladies [unclear]. Loudly. Loudly, loudly.
Sahaja Yogi: Cross in that one or swastika? Is there the mirror here? I have a very big nice mirror which is lying with Me, because you must have a good nice mirror. and that I will give you. There is a very nice article, in French.
Shri Mataji: Have you seen that?
Sahaja Yogi: It's from our side. Shri Mataji: Have you translated, did you get it translated?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. So we must get it this week.
Shri Mataji: Then I would like to see it. And also should be published you see, in "Yoga", "Nirmala Yoga" I think. See the comb there. Please put it right, [I think]. Something wrong with this one. You see, I don't know. Maybe small, I don't know, it's little bit broken.
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. From here only?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. Daisies? I think, let it be. They have got these flowers. Keep all these things together. The smaller ones, I think better put these. For My Puja I will bring my own. Gavin, I have the [unclear]. Let's see. But the size is not all right. This is Mine and old one. This is one karat, about, I don't know, maybe less or... How much he was saying?
Sahaja Yogi: He was saying about, a very fine quality, quite with very little impurities, a three quarter karat, it costs about two thousands. How? Very expensive he is saying. Under this, other one it was one karat, but it was yellow color.
Shri Mataji: We can get it here better.
Sahaja Yogi: Maybe. And tell him to forget it. I'll get one here. Forget it. I'm surprised. Modi is coming. He's an expert. How is it they can't get good ones there in? [Hindi / Marathi] [Hindi / Marathi] [Hindi / Marathi] It`s all right. Left Vishuddi. All right? It's cool down. You want one? You have very small fingers. When your fingers will become bigger, we'll give you, all right? Now your fingers are very small. And the toes are small too. C: Look at this Mother. C: Look at this. [unclear]
Shri Mataji: That is good, all right. Just put it there because all are [clean sets]. C: These are my legs. C: These are my legs, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Good.
Shri Mataji: Both legs.
Shri Mataji: Your toes are very small, you have very small toes.
Shri Mataji: Let me see yours, Athena. Your toes are very small also? Let me see. Very small, they are even smaller than yours. C: His, that is a big. C: It's biggest type.
Shri Mataji: She's the biggest type. She's the biggest type. C: She isn't.
Shri Mataji: Oh, she is. And you... C: I'm a big girl.
Shri Mataji: Your are a bigger one. And what about Katy? What about Ambika? She's a small size?
Shri Mataji: Very small. SMi: What is you size? C: I'm the small size.
Shri Mataji: Small size, yes. C: I'm a big size.
Shri Mataji: Katy is a big size. C: No, she is a small size. C: No, she is a small size. That's the smallest size. C: Like they are babies.
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Now, sit down, all of you sit down. All right? On the head. C: Look at this, Mother. Look at this, Mother. Now, don't fight. Now sit down for the Aarti. You are all supposed to sit down. Come along. Athena, you sit down now. Aarti is going to be there. Come along. Ambika sit down. Come, come and sit here. Everyone sit down. All right, all right. Sit down, sit down. She's loving you. Great. Thank you. I thought they have fragrance. All for the children. Now let the Aarti be over, all right? Come along [unclear]. She wants and Ambika also. Now, come along. Now sit down quietly. All of you should sit down very quietly. Sit down now, Athena. Now, come along, sit down nicely. Now the Aarti will... Sit that side, all of you. Come along. Olympia, sit here. It's going to be an Aarti now, all right? Put both the hands on the Mother Earth, and straight. Straight, on the Mother Earth, would be better idea. On the Mother Earth, straight on Mother Earth. Palms upwards. Just see there. [What do you see, watch out]. May God bless you all! May God bless you! May God bless you! I wish you could see the Kundalini of the people, so much improved, so clear cut, so nice. I can't imagine. All the chakras are so opened out.
Sahaja Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji! Thank you for blessing the new ashram, Mother. Thank you very much. And Nick, I think you should come with Me.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. I'll talk to you about it. But you'll drive the van back. Or else tomorrow morning if you bring the van, then I'll talk to you about it. We sit down and make the plan. What all other things are needed, can you point out? Apart from the food and all that. That I'll arrange.
Sahaja Yogi: We have to buy two fridges, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Fridges?
Sahaja Yogi: Fridges and maybe one cooker.
Shri Mataji: One, more? Yogi: One more oven we need to buy, and perhaps two fridges, minimum.
Shri Mataji: And freezer.
Sahaja Yogi: And maybe a freezer, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Freezer and two fridges.
Sahaja Yogi: There's a place in Epsom where we can them very cheaply, second hand.
Sahaja Yogi: So we can get second hand, good quality ones, somewhere nearby.
Shri Mataji: Furniture? Where?
Sahaja Yogi: No, fridges and freezers.
Sahaja Yogi: In Epsom, not ver far away.
Shri Mataji: Do you think you should buy a second hand?
Sahaja Yogi: For new, Mother....
Shri Mataji: All right. I mean they should be in working condition.
Shri Mataji: For the time, we should get very nice [unclear] and things. So who will do that? Epsom did you see?
Sahaja Yogi: There's a place in Epsom, Mother.
Shri Mataji: What? English?
Sahaja Yogi: There's a shop very close to here that's run by Indians, and he told me about those.
Sahaja Yogi: He imported staff there and it's just...
Shri Mataji: What, what [maker] are there?
Sahaja Yogi: All different makers I think, Mother. I mean if I'll shift tomorrow I'll go and see also, no problem. They should be good quality, somebody should see it. Not, English fridges second hand won't be good I think, I'm sorry to say. Say for example if you buy American or German, they are all right. And freezers? freezers you mean?
Sahaja Yogi: We'll need one for Your flat, Mother. We shall need one for Your flat, a freezer.
Sahaja Yogi: He says that Your flat will require one freezer.
Shri Mataji: My flat? A freezer? But what about you people? You too, should have a freezer. All right. Get one. It's all right.
Shri Mataji: For the time being we can run only one kitchen. It's possible. All right? I won't spend much money on you, don't worry. We'll combine together, all right? [What you can say?] So freezers and carpets. Do you have carpets?
Sahaja Yogi: We've got some of these but very few other things, Mother.
Shri Mataji: The bigger ones you don't have.
Sahaja Yogi: We, we are in need. We are in need of some carpets, I think.
Shri Mataji: You have only this kind? There are one or two rooms that already have carpets, but most of them I think they are in need. What are the things? I saw some carpets like this are not good.
Sahaja Yogi: [What like it was? ]
Shri Mataji: Very cheap type, you know something as...
Sahaja Yogi: Where You just saw it Mother, was inside?
Shri Mataji: Upstairs.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, there are some existing ones but I think are very poor. You just get the sizes of the rooms. Sometimes you do get those bigger ones, you get these. [unclear] If you have the sizes, we can get some, some carpets.
Sahaja Yogi: David says he's got some things, Mother.
Sahaja Yogi: I've got a lot of spare carpets, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Yes. David Praul?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I've got a lot of spare carpets, I'm just keeping out.
Shri Mataji: Spare carpets? Very large.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, a lot of spare carpets.
Shri Mataji: All God sent. Everything God sent in this company. What is the size? David, what is the size?
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, they are very big rooms, Mother, much big than this.
Shri Mataji: Is it? In any case, you get the sizes of the rooms.
Sahaja Yogi: We can measure those rapidly, Mother. Very quickly. There are many closing down things going on. Now you better rush [see to any more] or do any more. Ashrams is because there are closing down things but again start. All for you. We'll, we'll arrange the carpets also. You know carpets, fridges, what else?
Sahaja Yogi: Some more furniture I think, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Furniture. What about, you had bundles of furniture from there. What happened to that?
Sahaja Yogi: From where Mother?
Shri Mataji: From that Warwick road. We've brought all the staff that we have. We've brought everything. There is, there are more than two items that are spread around London with Sahaja Yogis looking after them, but very few items like that, Mother. I don't think [unclear]. I think we ought to get some more. Somewhere we will need a, perhaps a washing machine.
Shri Mataji: Washing machine?
Shri Mataji: Washing machine and...
Sahaja Yogi: For the laundry. But I don't think you should take second hand. It's not much expensive, because if they go out of order, it's useless. You have liabilities. We’ll have a washing machine, and freezer, Carpets we can have second hand, it's all right. All with a half price business. But I don't think for machines we should go in for, otherwise the washing machine is useless. Hounstitch, you get very good washing machines. From sublime to ridicule. As I told you the story that you see the child is flying the kite and the boy is talking to everyone. He's talking about everything, he's laughing, joking, But his attention is on the kite. That should be. We are doing everything in this world, but our attention is on God. That's how you will proceed further. We don't have to give up anything. We don't have to renounce anything, to be frightened of. Everything we will do. But our attention is on God. That's how is going to work out. All right? So tomorrow you come and make the list with Me? You come down, we'll cash some money from the bank, go around, find things for the kitchen also. Just now, I've got everything utensils. And what about your utensils?
Sahaja Yogi: We have so many tea chests but we have to unpack them with lots of crockery and [unclear].
Shri Mataji: A tea chest I will need.
Sahaja Yogi: We'll bring that tomorrow morning, Mother.
Shri Mataji: You'll bring them? You'll stay here overnight.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. All right, so bring the tea chest. What about some of my boxes? Have you got some of my boxes?
Sahaja Yogi: The tin boxes, Mother? They are still in Chelsham Road.
Shri Mataji: So I need them too. all right? I think you bring all My things from Chelsham Road here. And then we'll sort them out here. Put them in the ground floor. For the time being I think the ground floor you leave it, and you start working on the, all for all of you. The ground floor I'll see what we can do. So that, I think Mark or maybe you can see that wood part. And whatever wood it is needed, all right? You put it there, I'll give you the money for that. What's the [unclear] dry rot is very bad. So you have to put some sort of an antiseptic there. Not antiseptic but it's called as insecticide. There's a kind of insecticide for dry rot, that you put it there and cover it up this, all right? Anything else? We'll need some basic things also like hoover, vacuum cleaner.
Shri Mataji: What?
Sahaja Yogi: Vacuum cleaners, small pieces of equipment. And I don't know, that's at [Lonburry] the good one, whether it's working, but we need something to maintain the [garbage].
Shri Mataji: All right, you write it down whatever you need, we'll go down there, and do we have any card to the Westminster bank, do I have? We'll have to cash the cheques tomorrow, We'll go to the bank, cash the checks and then go around. Have some money already. So from day after tomorrow I think we can start this place working. Day after tomorrow, if the gas comes. So that's [unclear]. So we have to thank for getting this place, especially to people who have worked very hard to get it. like David [Day], John Robert, [unclear name], who else? Who else is there? I must know. Gavin. These three persons have really worked very hard. Who else? I hope you are not one of them. The way you look embarrassed.
Sahaja Yogi: I am not guilty, Mother. But I think I am also. All right? So thanks to your Mother and thanks to all of you that you've got this place. May God bless you! We are going to have a nice time, very nice time at Guru Puja, all right?
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you, Mother! So I don`t think tomorrow anybody should shift here and how many can stay in the ashram at Chelsham Road, be comfortable there and then once we have made this comfortable, then you come here, because he, I was very comfortably staying with him, and I want you all to give that comfort to him also, all right?
Sahaja Yogi: He will come back [unclear], Mother.
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon.
Sahaja Yogi: He'll come back [unclear].
Shri Mataji: All right. Look after him. He's a very, well educated, learned man. [Hindi or Marathi]
