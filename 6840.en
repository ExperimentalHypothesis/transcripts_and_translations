Shri Mataji: Where is it? That is the best, if you have [Unclear]

Sahaja yogi: Should we give the translation in French and in English or in French?

Shri Mataji: French is all right. So first you read the translation, then the name and then Om Swaha. That would be better, understood better. First read the translation. Who will do the translation?

Sahaja yogi 2: I can do, Shri Mataji, but it is the other book.

Shri Mataji: You will do the English. You can do? Alexander? You can do English?

Sahaja yogi 2: I can read in English.

Shri Mataji: No, that would be in Sanskrit. What I am saying, you read French.

[Mantra chanting starts.]

Four times, Shri Ganesha Sakshat.

Sahaja yogi : Shall I explain in English?

Shri Mataji: What I am saying, first you have to say it in French, the translation. Then you say in Sanskrit. Then you say, "Om Swaha."

[Hundred and Eight Names of Vishnu is chanted.]

Shri Mataji: Now I would say that whatever badhas you have to say, you better say it.

Sahaja yogi: I say it in English, Shri Mataji, against all the badhas, all the false gurus who prevent the seekers from coming.

Shri Mataji : Also say it in English because I must know what's going on. If you say in Sanskrit I know, or in English, Marathi, it will be all right, but French I don't know. All right?

Sahaja yogi : Yes, he says in French and I say in English.

Shri Mataji: Now come along. First you say in English and then in French.

Sahaja yogi: Against all the badhas who prevent us from coming into Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Badhas from the neighbors.

Sahaja yogi : Against all the badhas of the neighbors.

Shri Mataji : Then about getting the house here, near [Sounds like: Chatwick.]

Sahaja yogi: Against all the badhas who would prevent us from having the beautiful new ashram chosen by our Mother.

Sahaja yogi : Against all the badhas of the super ego.

Shri Mataji: Now about all the centers in the world of Sahaja Yoga.

Sahaja yogi: Against all the badhas who attacked the centers of the Sahaja Yogis in the world.

Shri Mataji: Badhas in America.

Sahaja yogi: Against all the badhas in America.

Shri Mataji: For getting all the properties that we have to have.

Sahaja yogi : Against all the badhas who prevent us from getting all the properties within Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: All personal badhas ....

Sahaja yogi : All the personal badhas.

Shri Mataji: [unclear] with which we torture our Mother.

Sahaja yogi : All the badhas, our personal badhas with which we torture our Shri Mother.

Shri Mataji: For the sale of 48 Brompton Square. Badhas in the sale of Brompton Square because of the golden builders.

Sahaja yogi: All the badhas who prevent from the sale, from the success of the selling of the house in Brompton Square.

Shri Mataji: By golden builders, for badhas in the material lives of Sahaja yogis.

Sahaja yogi: The badhas who prevent from getting the material wealth of the golden builders within Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Badhas of all the Sahaja yogis who are jobless.

Sahaja yogi: Against all the badhas of the Sahaja yogis who are jobless.

Shri Mataji: All the indisciplined Sahaja yogis who do not meditate regularly.

Sahaja yogi: Against all the badhas of the Sahaja yogis who lacks in discipline and don't meditate regularly.

Shri Mataji: All the badhas of all the Sahaja yogis who try to boss above each other, to boss, to dominate.

Sahaja yogi: Against all the badhas of the Sahaja yogis who want to dominate the other Sahaja yogis.

Shri Mataji: Why do you say, "Nira badha?"

Sahaja yogi: I don't know. In India you say, "Nira badha." That's what happens.

Shri Mataji: No, no.

Sahaja yogi: "Om Swaha" only. For the time say, "Om Swaha." Nira badha means Mother's name.

Shri Mataji: You should not say, "Nira badha." Nira badha also means that all the badhas, but it's My name also. Better not take that. All right, so now you can say about the centers and the progress of spiritual quality.

Sahaja yogi: Against all the badhas who prevent from growing within ourself in spirituality in the faith of Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Now all the badhas of the audiences which come to Mother's program.

Sahaja yogi: Against all the badhas of the audiences who come to the program and disturb the audience.

Shri Mataji: Badhas of the new people.

Now what you can do is to - all the badhas, whatever badhas are left out.

Sahaja yogi: All the remaining badhas, knowingly and unknowingly.

Shri Mataji: Now this is the completion of the last. It's the final. Put everything first of all. Put it in the center.

Take some grapes, I think. Good idea. Which is the one used for ...

Sahaja yogi: This one is for wine, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: For all the wines, badhas of the wines. Let all the wines be ruined. Only the grape fruit should be there, only the grape juices but no wine fermentation. Apple, cider and also some barley if it was dried there. Barley. Scotch whisky for barley.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, there is some prunes for alcohol of prunes.

Shri Mataji: Yes, Om Swaha.

Sahaja yogi: They make alcohol with pears, very famous in Switzerland.

Shri Mataji: Yes, put it there.

All the fruits can be put there, I think. To the fire, yes, put all the fruits.

Sahaja yogi: Half of the Swiss economy will collapse, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Half will be bankrupt. Sahaja yogis will have jobs.

[Shri Mataji's talk begins after the havan.]

See, we need not have so much surplus money in one country. If you can drink, that means you have surplus money. Otherwise, a person who has limited money cannot drink. I knew a government servant. He said, "I cannot drink," he said, "because I cannot afford it." I said, "That's very true. How can you drink? As a government servant you can't drink, but if you are drinking that means you are dishonest." So that is what it is that when you have surplus money we think of licentiousness, we think of drinking, eating and ruining ourselves.

You see, whatever you give to human beings they know how to make a mess out of it. If you give them money they will destroy themselves. If you give them power they'll destroy others. In Marathi there's a saying, [Mother speaks in Marathi]. This means that a burning wood, you call this wood burning given in the hands of a bhoot. It is like that. You give to human beings anything just to oblige, just to make him feel happy, he starts going amok. Even in Sahaja Yoga you try to be nice to someone, he thinks no end of himself. Like the other day I called somebody here, you see, so she thought she is a special person. So at least in Sahaja Yoga one should not use a burning wood like a bhoot, but like a Sahaja yogi for the yagya. So be on the look-out how you behave. So may God bless you all. It was a wonderful time in Geneva.

Look after the new people, and as Warren has told me what they do in Australia, they give ten people to one person or twenty people to one person to handle so that that person guides. So then you divide the names among ten, say, for ten persons. One person like that, whatever his division is, and the persons must look after those ten persons, write letters to them, go to them, see them, talk to them, find out what's the problem is, how you can help them.

Now for tonight have you got photographs to be given to them?

Sahaja yogi: All the time, yes.

Shri Mataji. All the time. You are giving them photographs, and the books are there?

Sahaja yogi: We are giving books. We are giving [Unclear]. We are giving the address of the ashram and the address of the follow-up, which we have on Friday.

Shri Mataji: And the phone number.

Sahaja yogi: The phone number and we give you photograph.

Shri Mataji: And do you tell them about the photograph? Is it written with the photograph?

Sahaja yogi: Yes, and as soon as the programs are over we invite them personally to a program and to follow-ups.

Shri Mataji: To a dinner. Better invite them first to dinner.

Sahaja yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Then to lunch.

Sahaja yogi: Then to lunch.

Shri Mataji: Then to breakfast. Then to fasting. Sometimes you should. Sometimes no harm. Sometimes it's all right.

Sahaja yogi: Once a week is too much?

Shri Mataji: Now you just don't start that. Otherwise he'll just go on a fast! No, I'm saying I mean it's good to fast sometimes. There's no harm in fasting. It's a good idea but you shouldn't fast, say, on a Monday. You can fast on a Wednesday because that is the day one works very hard. Wednesday is Brahmadeva. Let him fast a little bit. That also is not to be done in the name of God, just for your body. [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi.] You see, it is not in my name, at least. All right, let's have something interesting also.

So this is to wish Shri Krishna a happy birthday. So we will have some dance program now. We all can sit this side and we can see the dance that side.
