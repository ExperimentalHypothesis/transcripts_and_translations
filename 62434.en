FIRST INTERVIEW

Shri Mataji: ... higher. Because at your stage, people do not know the absolute truth. So, that higher state has been achieved, which I call as the state of the Spirit. And when you become the Spirit, then you get to know or to feel, on your nervous system, the All-pervading Power which is doing all the living work. As these flowers have come out of the seeds, you see. Like we have become human beings from amoeba. All this living work is done by this pervading Power which is the power of love, you can say, because it is absolute, it is the truth.

So, we have to achieve that state. Once you achieve that state, what happens? That you get empowered that you can give this thing to others also, because in every human being, there is this residual power which we call as Kundalini in the triangular bone. And like as you have this connection, you get connected with that Power by the ascent or awakening of this power from your triangular bone.

When it passes through your fontanel bone area, then you get connected to that subtle energy which you normally do not feel, because the human awareness still gross, you have to accept it. So this is the knowledge of the roots. You have the knowledge of the tree, you see. And we have this whole civilization and the tree has grown too much. So we have to find out our roots, otherwise it's a shock.

Interviewer: I understand it because I have a small experience before this. A second question [unclear] extra-sense.
Shri Mataji: I’ll tell you.
Interviewer: [Unclear] Many, many intellectuals who are in our country, pathways that such events or for a great audience, it's rather interesting people [unclear] what you can say for this?
Shri Mataji: It’s a very dangerous thing to play with these things, because they cannot explain how they work it out, they have no idea.

Recently, I talked to the scientists and told them that, "You have no idea of the areas which we call as collective subconscious. From where all the viruses come, from where all these proteins that cause cancer and all that come. That area, you are not aware of".
And these people have [unclear] that area and put some dead things on us, and we become mesmerized and our brain is washed. Little bit, you might feel better because some other personality has come on you. But it has such a bad effect.

Recently, in Moscow, I met all the children who had come, who have been watching a film of someone like that. And all the time every morning they sit and watch. One boy had his eyes completely constricted and had gone towards the nose, n you see. Another one had a brain paralysis. Another one was feeling ill all the time, his brain was out. Another one had his hand stuck to his body. Another one could not even walk. So, all these things happened after seeing them.

So in the beginning, they thought it might improve them or something. All the children who were watching, were innocent. They didn't know what was happening. So this is a very well-known thing, in India, we call it [unclear], means the knowledge of the dead. And they use the dead to mesmerize people and utilize them. And they cannot explain how they do it.

But Sahaja Yoga can be explained very easily. Scientists can understand, doctors can understand, because it is the control of the parasympathetic nervous system. It is the science of all the sciences, and it can explain everything clearly. It's not that just a blind sort of a thing, it is not. And secondly, that these people are very money oriented. They want money out of it.

This is a living process which I am doing. Sahaja Yoga means, ‘saha’ means with, ‘ja’ is born, is this yoga means the union with this All-pervading Power. It’s your right as a living person, as a seed can become a flower and the flower has a right to become a fruit. You have a right to become a super human being. But that is to be explained, first of all and you cannot pay. You don't pay anything to the Mother Earth for giving you flowers. So, you can't pay for it. It's not a money-oriented nonsense.

Interviewer: I understand. Then the last question. Can you say that, as far as I know, in India, and in certain areas, it has the most largest audience.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Interviewer: I said, in India, in your country, it has the most largest audience than in other countries. Why is it so? It's actually means that most of people who came for your program, came to take from you a health, first of all, and not the experience.
Shri Mataji: The experience. They came from the experience. It's very easy. I must say, in India, they have a background and they know what is true and what is false. They say, "Thank God, we don't have much money. So, all these horrible false people have gone to America and to all the places, to befool them". Now in your country, they could have come. Thank God you don't have that much money. Thank God for that, this time.

But also another thing is there, that you see, you people have no conditionings of any religion. No conditionings. The other countries have conditionings, you see. Like they have Christianity, Islam, things like that. These are all man-made religions. The real religion is within yourself. And they do not follow, they do not follow Christ, they do not follow Mohammed sahib, they do not follow. They have their own style of following and they are not looking for what is said in all the religions. It's said that you must seek the eternal and whatever is transitory is to be treated in its own understanding and its own limitations.
But these people are not finding out the eternal but just money. They are money-oriented or power-oriented. You see, they'll meet the kings, the prime ministers, this that. They are more interested in power, or they are more interested in money. But they are not interested in saintliness. Their lives are not saintly. They have to be pure people. They are not.

But as a result of that, you become so pure. But I think, basically, Russians are very wise people, I think. I don't understand why, how, how it has clicked. I mean everybody, we have some Americans here, they said, "We just find [unclear]". And they came only for experience. Very few came for sickness, very few with their children or something, very few. Most of them were very well-educated people, professionals, very nice people.

Then you are so good, and we have everything here, everything.
Interviewer: I want to be as [unclear]"as you, thank you.

Shri Mataji: You must have faith in yourself. That's the point I'm saying to all the Russians. You must have faith in yourself. That's very important. Have faith in yourself. That is someway or other lacking.
Interviewer: I’ll try to do this.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.
Interviewer: Thank you.
Shri Mataji: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: I hope, I hope you will help your young people here, because this can take you out of drugs, out of alcohol, out of so many things and you make a powerful people.
Interviewer: [Unclear] very interesting.
Shri Mataji: Yes?
And the young get it very much faster and they settle into it very much faster also.
Interviewer: Thank you.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

Interviewer: That’s our [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Thank you.

SECOND INTERVIEW

Shri Mataji: ... And I want to work it out. And once you get your Self-realisation, you definitely know what I am. But I must be something, isn't it?
Lady: Yes, another question about the meditation. It's in such a way you don't have your person to be.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it works out. Many people have been cured only by photograph. I was not there. So they used My photograph for the patients and they were cured. So, it has something to do with it. And after this, I've shown some photographs which you’ll be surprised how things happen. You know, the cameras are catching up with the vibrations.
Lady: Yeah, and another question is that, for example, in our country, in Kiev, we have some group of people that meditate in the star, on the star. And because they believe that in the star there are the best, the best representation of the God, and the space energy too.

Shri Mataji: And what stars?
Lady: A little blue star, they see that he is in the sky. And meditate with it.
Shri Mataji: It’s all mental. It’s artificial.
Lady: But how can you feel when those people that exactly meditate on you?
Shri Mataji: They need not be a meditate on Me, they have to meditate on themselves. First they should find out themselves. They have to raise their own Kundalini. And they should feel this All-pervading Power. Then they have to know that they have now become the Spirit. You see, when they are established, they will see, through them, this power will be flowing. And they get empowered and they can cure people. And this can be explained even scientifically. The whole thing is absolutely like a ‘glasnost’, you see, absolutely transparent. You can see for yourself. So this is not something imaginary.
Lady: OK.

[Someone else is speaking in Russian]
Lady: My friend said in Russian to me, his stomach was ill. But when he came and see you, his illness was lost.

Shri Mataji: It was lost. The other day, we had a lady suffering from what was she suffering from what was the decease?
Sahaja Yogi: Multiple sclerosis.
Shri Mataji: Multiple sclerosis. And she could not walk, she could not sit down, very difficult for her. And we raised her Kundalini. It's your own power. We raised her Kundalini and by raising the Kundalini she was all right. But still she was remembering as if she was still ill. So I told her, "Now get up and walk". And she started walking so fast, and you think you know what had happened to her. It's a vital power which works it out and your own power corrects everything.
Lady: Thank you.
Other person: Spasibo.

Shri Mataji: Maybe you should ask about this. You have to ask.

Lady: Well, now I have the extra sensorial have a meeting this day [unclear] meeting with that force only in this day, the 29 of June. And it is very interesting. Why this day is so good? How do you think?
Shri Mataji: [Laughing] No, that’s nothing. Always, you see, negative forces- positive forces could destroy that. But what I was chocked was that, I saw some children, quite a lot in Moscow, who had seen a Hindu, somebody who is ESP [extra sensorial perception] sort of things. And he- the children are suffering terribly. Their eyes have become brown and their hands have become shortened like this. Some children can't walk. Some have paralysed brain and somebody's brain is off, like that. And they are very, very small children, they are about say, up to ten years of age. And they have been watching the film and they got these problems, you see. So, I had to correct them. Then I discovered that these people are putting some sort of a spirit, dead spirit on them, mesmerizing them and brain washing people also.

So, you should be very careful, very, very careful with them. We know all these things in India. We call it as a plague of India. They use the knowledge of the dead. They use this knowledge of the death and mesmerize people and brainwash them. They never [unclear]. For the time being, it might appear to be little bit exciting, because another personality comes sit on you. But later on, it is very harmful. And this is what all the false gurus are doing in many grand places. And here these people have come. They are very money-oriented. They want to have money.
But Sahaja Yoga is a living process, is a developed study, a living process which you cannot pay for that. Like, we don't pay to Mother Earth for giving us flowers. So it's a living process. So, this is one thing one must understand, that this living force is also explainable, is to be understood. You can get to it, you yourself can master it. And you all can cure. And not only cure, but you can enjoy life much better.

Lady: I have another question about the teachers, about the real sahaj teachers and not -because I think there are like teachers [unclear] after it they became more ill than before. How do you think about this problem? It's really dangerous and really big problem in our time.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is because you know it's a market, they think there's a market of people who are seeking the truth. So they have come out. Some of them have come out from Indian jails, you see. And some of them from a very ordinary type of life. They have very ordinary people and very limited.

One better than the other, some teaching this yoga, another teaching that yoga, somebody teaching transcendental meditation, all this is falsehood. Falsehood just to make money and it is the same as I told you with ESP to mesmerize people. The thing is, you must see the disciples, what have they achieve, you see. Like you see these, my children are here, they are so knowledgeable all over the world. They are so nice. They are so righteous. They are so friendly. They are so much above normal people. So, you should see these people and then understand. But if you go to their disciples, you find they are just the same. Not only that, but they are worse because they are sick. So, be very careful.

There is one fellow who is giving diamonds, Sathya Sai Baba, another is this TM. Another is this Integral Yoga, then Raja Yoga, all this. I talked to them yesterday, at length. I told them, I explained to them, how they are false people. You can get the tape and see for yourself.
But one thing one must do, if you don't give them any money, then they will all go away.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
That's the main thing, just because they are beggars, that's all. You can purchase them very easily.

Lady: And another question. Can you explain, in few words, your socials on 70th years, because we hear a lot of them, but not from you, and it's very hard to find some information about it because we know that we have some resources in 70th years [unclear question].
Shri Mataji: Seventeen?
Lady: In 70th year, 1970.
Shri Mataji: What about?
Lady: The medicine resources of the Kundalini.
Lady: I’ve discovered it, in a way, you see. I - of course I was born with the knowledge - but what I felt that, it should be made ‘en masse’, people should get it. So with my subtle ideas and subtle attention, I tried to study human beings: what are their problems, why can’t we have ‘en masse’. Any discovery has to be ultimately going to public, to the collective. Otherwise, what's the use? So, I worked it out. And in 1970, I discovered a method by which it can be done [unsure]. Then I started it, one week. Now so many years have passed, and it’s working out very well.
Thank you.
I bless you. [Shri Mataji does namaste]
Lady: Thank you, Mother.

Lady: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: Please do, please do help them, they will be. I think Russians are someway or other, the greatest country. All right?
Lady: Thank you.
Shri Mataji: [Hindi] A little present for you from Mother. [Unclear].
