FIRST INTERVIEW

Shri Mataji: ... higher. Because at your stage, people do not know the absolute truth. So, that higher state has been achieved, which I call as the state of the Spirit. And when you become the Spirit, then you get to know or to feel, on your nervous system, the All-pervading Power which is doing all the living work. As these flowers have come out of the seeds, you see. Like we have become human beings from amoeba. All this living work is done by this pervading Power which is the power of love, you can say, because it is absolute, it is the truth.

So, we have to achieve that state. Once you achieve that state, what happens? That you get empowered that you can give this thing to others also, because in every human being, there is this residual power which we call as Kundalini in the triangular bone. And like as you have this connection, you get connected with that Power by the ascent or awakening of this power from your triangular bone.

When it passes through your fontanel bone area, then you get connected to that subtle energy which you normally do not feel, because the human awareness still gross, you have to accept it. So this is the knowledge of the roots. You have the knowledge of the tree, you see. And we have this whole civilization and the tree has grown too much. So we have to find out our roots, otherwise it's a shock.

Interviewer: I understand it because I have a small experience before this. A second question [unclear] extra-sense.
Shri Mataji: I’ll tell you.
Interviewer: [Unclear] Many, many intellectuals who are in our country, pathways that such events or for a great audience, it's rather interesting people [unclear] what you can say for this?
Shri Mataji: It’s a very dangerous thing to play with these things, because they cannot explain how they work it out, they have no idea.

Recently, I talked to the scientists and told them that, "You have no idea of the areas which we call as collective subconscious. From where all the viruses come, from where all these proteins that cause cancer and all that come. That area, you are not aware of".
And these people have [unclear] that area and put some dead things on us, and we become mesmerized and our brain is washed. Little bit, you might feel better because some other personality has come on you. But it has such a bad effect.

Recently, in Moscow, I met all the children who had come, who have been watching a film of someone like that. And all the time every morning they sit and watch. One boy had his eyes completely constricted and had gone towards the nose, n you see. Another one had a brain paralysis. Another one was feeling ill all the time, his brain was out. Another one had his hand stuck to his body. Another one could not even walk. So, all these things happened after seeing them.

So in the beginning, they thought it might improve them or something. All the children who were watching, were innocent. They didn't know what was happening. So this is a very well-known thing, in India, we call it [unclear], means the knowledge of the dead. And they use the dead to mesmerize people and utilize them. And they cannot explain how they do it.

But Sahaja Yoga can be explained very easily. Scientists can understand, doctors can understand, because it is the control of the parasympathetic nervous system. It is the science of all the sciences, and it can explain everything clearly. It's not that just a blind sort of a thing, it is not. And secondly, that these people are very money oriented. They want money out of it.

This is a living process which I am doing. Sahaja Yoga means, ‘saha’ means with, ‘ja’ is born, is this yoga means the union with this All-pervading Power. It’s your right as a living person, as a seed can become a flower and the flower has a right to become a fruit. You have a right to become a super human being. But that is to be explained, first of all and you cannot pay. You don't pay anything to the Mother Earth for giving you flowers. So, you can't pay for it. It's not a money-oriented nonsense.

Interviewer: I understand. Then the last question. Can you say that, as far as I know, in India, and in certain areas, it has the most largest audience.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Interviewer: I said, in India, in your country, it has the most largest audience than in other countries. Why is it so? It's actually means that most of people who came for your program, came to take from you a health, first of all, and not the experience.
Shri Mataji: The experience. They came from the experience. It's very easy. I must say, in India, they have a background and they know what is true and what is false. They say, "Thank God, we don't have much money. So, all these horrible false people have gone to America and to all the places, to befool them". Now in your country, they could have come. Thank God you don't have that much money. Thank God for that, this time.

But also another thing is there, that you see, you people have no conditionings of any religion. No conditionings. The other countries have conditionings, you see. Like they have Christianity, Islam, things like that. These are all man-made religions. The real religion is within yourself. And they do not follow, they do not follow Christ, they do not follow Mohammed sahib, they do not follow. They have their own style of following and they are not looking for what is said in all the religions. It's said that you must seek the eternal and whatever is transitory is to be treated in its own understanding and its own limitations.
But these people are not finding out the eternal but just money. They are money-oriented or power-oriented. You see, they'll meet the kings, the prime ministers, this that. They are more interested in power, or they are more interested in money. But they are not interested in saintliness. Their lives are not saintly. They have to be pure people. They are not.

But as a result of that, you become so pure. But I think, basically, Russians are very wise people, I think. I don't understand why, how, how it has clicked. I mean everybody, we have some Americans here, they said, "We just find [unclear]". And they came only for experience. Very few came for sickness, very few with their children or something, very few. Most of them were very well-educated people, professionals, very nice people.

Then you are so good, and we have everything here, everything.
Interviewer: I want to be as [unclear]"as you, thank you.

Shri Mataji: You must have faith in yourself. That's the point I'm saying to all the Russians. You must have faith in yourself. That's very important. Have faith in yourself. That is someway or other lacking.
Interviewer: I’ll try to do this.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.
Interviewer: Thank you.
Shri Mataji: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: I hope, I hope you will help your young people here, because this can take you out of drugs, out of alcohol, out of so many things and you make a powerful people.
Interviewer: [Unclear] very interesting.
Shri Mataji: Yes?
And the young get it very much faster and they settle into it very much faster also.
Interviewer: Thank you.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

Interviewer: That’s our [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Thank you.

SECOND INTERVIEW

Shri Mataji: ... And I want to work it out. And once you get your Self-realisation, you definitely know what I am. But I must be something, isn't it?
Lady: Yes, another question about the meditation. It's in such a way you don't have your person to be.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it works out. Many people have been cured only by photograph. I was not there. So they used My photograph for the patients and they were cured. So, it has something to do with it. And after this, I've shown some photographs which you’ll be surprised how things happen. You know, the cameras are catching up with the vibrations.
Lady: Yeah, and another question is that, for example, in our country, in Kiev, we have some group of people that meditate in the star, on the star. And because they believe that in the star there are the best, the best representation of the God, and the space energy too.

Shri Mataji: And what stars?
Lady: A little blue star, they see that he is in the sky. And meditate with it.
Shri Mataji: It’s all mental. It’s artificial.
Lady: But how can you feel when those people that exactly meditate on you?
Shri Mataji: They need not be a meditate on Me, they have to meditate on themselves. First they should find out themselves. They have to raise their own Kundalini. And they should feel this All-pervading Power. Then they have to know that they have now become the Spirit. You see, when they are established, they will see, through them, this power will be flowing. And they get empowered and they can cure people. And this can be explained even scientifically. The whole thing is absolutely like a ‘glasnost’, you see, absolutely transparent. You can see for yourself. So this is not something imaginary.
Lady: OK.
