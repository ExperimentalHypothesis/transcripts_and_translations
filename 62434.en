Shri Mataji: ... higher. Because at your stage, people do not know the absolute truth. So, that higher state has been achieved, which I call as the state of the Spirit. And when you become the Spirit, then you get to know or to feel, on your nervous system, the All-pervading Power which is doing all the living work. As these flowers have come out of the seeds, you see. Like we have become human beings from amoeba. All this living work is done by this pervading Power which is the power of love, you can say, because it is absolute, it is the truth.

So, we have to achieve that state. Once you achieve that state, what happens? That you get empowered that you can give this thing to others also, because in every human being, there is this residual power which we call as Kundalini in the triangular bone. And like as you have this connection, you get connected with that Power by the ascent or awakening of this power from your triangular bone.

When it passes through your fontanel bone area, then you get connected to that subtle energy which you normally do not feel, because the human awareness still gross, you have to accept it. So this is the knowledge of the roots. You have the knowledge of the tree, you see. And we have this whole civilization and the tree has grown too much. So we have to find out our roots, otherwise it's a shock.
