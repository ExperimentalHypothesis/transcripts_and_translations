Draft Transcript (first 3:07 of the talk):

"It's such a joyous moment to come to Boston. We had Steve [Kirby] in Bristol who was representative of that category of people who are very honest seekers. And he really impressed me. He got his realization and he was lost. I didn't know where he had gone. And when I came back from Paris, I received a very nice telegram from him saying that Boston would like to have a program. I knew there were lots of universities and many young seekers and many people who are thinking of the beyond.

It's a new category of human beings that are born, absolutely a new category. Such a category never existed before, which is seeking. They are not satisfied with what they have. Is not only the aftereffects of affluence. Some people feel because affluence came to America, as a result of that people are sort of dissatisfied with all material value, material things, and they are seeking. It is not today. This is the time, the special time, where people are to be born, this has to be done. You are not seekers of today, you are seekers of many lives. And you're been seeking. Is mentioned in one of the very old Puranas, called [UNCLEAR SANSKRIT NAME] Purana, that Kali Yuga is the time when thousands of seekers will be born and they will get their realization.

It has been announced by many, many poets also. In England we had one William Blake, I was amazed the way He described Sahaja Yoga. He says, men of God will be born in these special times and they will become Prophets and they will have a capacity to make others Prophets. Apart from that, He has mentioned precisely where the center will be located, where I will be living first. It's amazing, how He has prophesized all these things.

We have to think very scientifically also about certain things, which can not be answered otherwise. Why have we become human beings from amoeba stage to this stage? Is there any purpose of our life?"
