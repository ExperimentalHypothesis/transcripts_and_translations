Brahmapuri Puja. Brahmapuri (India), 30 December 1989.

I’m sorry what has happened yesterday, but I think the war has begun between the evil and good, and after all the good prevails. In these modern times, evil used to prevail over good but now in this Kruta Yuga the evil will be completely conquered by good, and not that but good will spread all over. The evil has the capacity to go to extremes and then to fall out of the evolutionary process completely, because they are blind they cannot see the good that’s why they are evil. If they could see the good they would give up their evil. In our country which is a country of yoga, especially Maharastra which is the country of the saints, I was amazed to hear what people are up to. One of the real sources of this nonsense seems to be Rajneesh, the horrible fellow. Because he has made an exhibition here absolutely denouncing all the deities and saying all kinds of dirty things, and I think the chief minister of this place is also hand in glove with him and they are all trying to prove that there is no God, there is no spirituality. They want to establish that science is everything. We have no heritage of science in India, we have the heritage of spirituality. I mean nobody is known as such a great scientist in this country. Nobody has made any special inventions, and the way people are organising it in the name of science there is hardly anyone who has done anything of science. So the evil which has taken this new form of talking about science and denouncing God.

Of course in the West also the same thing has happened to a great extent but not to that extent. They have not discarded everything that was spiritual, but here they have gone headlong. Those few people who are there, very very few, but they are there. So it’s a very bad growth in this country, it won’t survive I know, it cannot survive because this country is so full of spirituality. In the West because people took to science they have lost all culture of society. There is no culture of society. The etiquette are limited to fork and spoon or how you visit each other. There is no other culture. It’s so outside, there is nothing deep in it because they have taken absolutely to the modern, or we can say that is the industrial evolution of the people, they have taken to all that and have lost contact with reality. The culture of any country can only survive on spirituality. Science cannot talk of this, and it has so many limitations that it cannot even answer simple few questions that are facing them. Above all they have no idea what is love, they have no idea what is the all pervading power. Now you all have felt it, and you know what it is, and you know how to use it.

So under these circumstances I find that those people who are mediocres in Sahaja Yoga cannot help much for establishing goodness. You have to be very clean within yourself, you have to be very powerful within yourself and you have to be extremely sensitive.

So, we are not to waste our energy, our attention onto superficial and nonsensical things. You have to get out of it, and we have to become people who are detached, detached from any things which create problems. If you take a detached view of everything you will have a kind of a life that will nourish your society which is now sick. Is a sick society, is a decadent society, and for that decadent society you need people who are very morally strong, who are tremendously pure and who know everything about Sahaja Yoga. The mediocrity in Sahaja Yoga is very common in the West, very common and so much involved into their personal problems that I cannot understand how will they rise above this nonsensical, personal view, point of view. So, one has to realise that the whole tree that has grown outside so much due to industrial revolution has to seek its own nourishment from spirituality which is in India. No doubt. Spirituality without development has no meaning. Spirituality has to have development outside otherwise it is lost in the Mother Earth. It has to sprout and it has to show results, which you are showing no doubt, in so many ways Indian Sahaja Yogis are trying to show that though they are rather slow about that one. So it’s something funny that in the West people are rather slow, Sahaja Yogis are rather slow about their spirituality, and in India people are rather slow about their manifestation outside.

Unless and until we really do some dedicated effort it’s not going to work out. So I hope as we have circulated letters, that we have come here not for fun but for dedication, and for our ascent and it’s a pilgrimage. Talking news, talking about small things, quarrelling with each other is out of question of course, but domination, terrible domination of falsehood just to think that you are leaders, why is he leader, shows that we are not yet worthy. So the worthiness of a ship is very important if it has to fight the turbulence of the sea. If it cannot fight the turbulence of the sea then it is definitely not seaworthy and it is absolutely useless because it cannot go across. In the same way if you have to be something, you have to work it out in such a manner that you really become worthy of crossing this ocean of illusion and that many could cross with you. As in India they have started at every place, at every home, at every family a center. If they invite people, they talk about nothing but Sahaja Yoga. Now you can go all out to talk about it, I give you permission to tell them that I have come, there’s nothing to hide. And you have to go and open the doors of many churches and many temples, and many organisations and tell them that I am there.

Now the time has come, you can see it so clearly, it’s so obvious. First I used to say I would not go to the newspapers, this not good that’s not good, let us work it out but it has come now so much, that I have to say things and I am going to say them, very openly I am going to say them, but I want all of you to be such that nobody should point out a finger at you to say, “Oh, this is a Sahaja Yogi, and how this Sahaja Yogi’s behaving.” If somebody is stupid and not working it out is better to get rid of such a person or else help that person and tell him that you have to come out, you can’t be here, we don’t want mediocre people here. We want somebody extraordinarily, pure people.

The purity is the main point which we have to have, once you are pure you don’t have to worry, then I look after you. But the purity of mind, purity of heart, and the purity of your attention, these three things are very important.

Then it works out, you’ll be surprised, collectivity will grow in no time. There is a tendency among Sahaja Yogis also still to go back to the same materialism and to try to have your own house, your family, your children, this sort of a nonsense. We have to be in the ashrams, we have to work it out, we have to work it out very beautifully that we all live very happily in the ashrams but I find still people cannot work it out that way. They are more concerned about their jobs, concerned about their things. Once you live in the ashrams I see that you get everything, but if you do not want to have the blessings of God, how can anybody help you? So tremendous sacrifice is needed, of course as you know in Sahaja Yoga I don’t need any money from you at all, but sacrifice is very important, and sacrifice of nonsensical ideas that you have. In every way we have to show that we saintly, the way you dress up, the way you live, the way you think, the way you behave, the way you have relationships with each other and the way you lead your married life, and the way you look at your children.

Unless and until you have purity the light of love will not shine, the light of love will not shine.

You have to absorb the light of love within yourself, but you cannot unless and until you are a pure personality. And that pure personality has to develop by your meditation, by working hard, it’s a question of few years. In 10 years we can change the whole world, in 10 years but you have to be really very dedicated (applause). It is you who has to change, not me. You have to work it out, not me. I have done my level best but within 10 years it should be possible that every Sahaja Yogi should become a tremendous force of Sahaja Yoga. So please try to avoid all those who are mediocre. If you find mediocrity, the leaders must go all out to correct them, all out to tell them off. Don’t tolerate.

You don’t have to be very mild on this one, you have to tell them frankly that see now you are an extremely mediocre person for Sahaja Yoga, is not meant for mediocres, is not meant for foolish people, is not meant for stupid people, is meant for something who are ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of truth. These people are saying that “Why don’t you go the way of science”, I say “Why don’t you go the way of truth”. Take to truth. Science is not truth. Today it might appear, tomorrow it disappears. Today you may think it is correct, but every hypothesis is challenged, every law is challenged, that’s no law.

You have to use Sahaja Yoga in every practical life everywhere. But in no way you have to be fanatic about it. Like I have seen some people start giving vibrations or they start moving their hands for bandhans, even if I am sitting they are doing like that. There is no stupidity about it, it has to be very dignified, decent and decorous. But for that we need really people of quality, and a complete obedience is needed I must say. I have told Indian people that time that they must have a proper case done for them, they just didn’t listen to me that time, they said “Mother, why do you want, you’ll be in trouble”, and all that, if they had listened to me there would have been no trouble today. But you must listen to me what I say, don’t give me explanations, don’t give me logic, but I know everything you know that. I know everything.

Now we have something good for you is the list of the marriages. But marriage is not such an important thing that you think about. It’s not such an important thing for you that you dedicate all your attention to that, it’s just by the way, because you have to have a marriage that’s why, there’s no need even to have sometimes. But you have to have it, and then letters after letters about your marriages, about your children, I just don’t want to read that. Nothing about Sahaja Yoga. If you are detached, whatever may be the quality of your wife you will not fall, whatever may be the quality of your husband you will not fall. So one has to be little concerned that what are we doing? What have we achieved? What are we going to give to the world? For me, you are my instruments, I don’t have to ask anybody else, you are my instruments and you have to work it out. You are not for me useless people, I have worked very hard with you, very hard so please don’t waste my energies also, and try to become very good Sahaja Yogis in every way that is possible, in every way you should be dedicated, in every way try to be something of very great qualities.

Now you have seen how people have becoming violent and there’s a violence on. Of course, this may not continue but it’s one of the signs that we have to be prepared to be very strong people, very strong, and that will work out I’m sure. They threw about 400 stones at least, maybe more according to the police report and very few people were hurt. What does that mean – that there is somebody who is avoiding all these troubles.

Regarding our tour further, now I have decided will not go to Atith because the commissioner the D.S.B.S. told me that it is better not to go, that these is very bad that these people are criminals so now until the election comes in they will be behaving like this manner. After the election of course they will be put down. So you should go by the understanding of the time and directly to Sangli, so we’ll go to Sangli, we will have a puja, you can do shopping whatever you like, and then from there will be going to Ganapatipule. But, it’s not fun, it’s not fun. It is our development, otherwise you will be coming to India, going back the same empty handed. I want you, everyone to be extremely active in your own sphere of life. To talk about Sahaja Yoga, you must wear my badges, you must wear my rings you must wear my necklaces so that people ask you “Who is this?”, then you should say “She is the Holy Ghost”. You can say “We think she is the Holy Ghost”. Let us see what happens. So, it’s a serious thing that I felt that I had to talk to you and that we have to be very very careful about how we look at ourselves. We have to be aware, we have to be aware about ourselves and what is happening. I’ve been telling you this many a times, we have to be aware as to what we are and what is happening. But if your jobs are important, everything else is important how are you going to work out Sahaja Yoga? So there has to be awareness, and with your awareness the light will spread. But it’s not silent, you have to talk about it. Eloquence is needed, it has to be eloquent all your light has to talk, the light has to say, the light has to express and has to be very confidently done. Let us see now after going from this tour how far people established new things.

So far, what my own opinion is that there are 50% of Sahaja Yogis in the West are still quite mediocre, and 25% of them are just there to take advantage. If they can get something free they would like to do it. 25% people are like that. It’s very sad but it is so. But I must say Indians are poor people but they will not do anything, they will never take anything free from me, nothing, they will not, they are very self respecting, and that is what we have to develop that self respect. Like I have seen I had a house in Hounslow, everybody went there and stayed there free, now we have a house there in Shuddy Camp where everybody who has no job goes and stays there, it’s such a nonsensical thing. So I’m even afraid to start any ashram in London, because same thing will start. If they can take advantage they would like to be there, even a spoon they would like to carry like that. It’s a shameless thing for a Sahaja Yogi to behave like that I think. We have to have full self respect, and we must understand that we have to sacrifice to do something about. Because this is the last leg I would say when I will be talking to you about all these things and in the beautiful atmosphere here on the bank of Krishna river. We have to understand that the river flows, it makes a sound, it makes a sound to show that she/it exists. But we are not only rivers, we are all the mountains, rivers, everything of the universe we are, and our manifestation is like a big zero as if the Mother Earth has been emptied out.

It is time that we should watch ourselves, see ourselves what’s wrong with us. Very important. I have to say this once again and again, but I don’t like to say these things because I love you so much, and I care for you so much, and you people also love me, but loving me is not sufficient, you have to love yourself and respect yourself. Only yourself is going to work out. As Shivaji Maharaj said “You must develop the religion of your Spirit”. That’s what we have to do, is to develop the religion of our Spirit, and once it happens we can get the whole world completely emancipated. This is our work and if we fail then it is the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis and nobody else. So for everyone I have to tell you that I don’t have to please you, you have to please me. For a small thing people react, for a small thing these people feel bad. If I don’t smile at somebody they feel bad. Little, little things they feel bad and they react. If I say anything they react. So how can anything go into you. If it is such a convexity how will you absorb it. It is important that we should try to absorb with humility, with understanding. Now you are Sahaja Yogis, you know I am Adi Shakti, you have have photographs, you have known that I am Adi Shakti but how much are we absorbing. How much we are taking within ourselves?

This work is much more than any one of the incarnations had to do, is much more than Christ, is much more than Rama, much more than Shri Krishna’s. So create such great people among you, because I have the power, only thing you have to have the absorption power, the acceptability but if you run after something very cheapish and something very frivolous is impossible. You have to ask for your depth and you have to take in whatever is emitting from my being. I hope now you all will take it up seriously, do your meditation every morning whatever maybe the time, every morning you have to do the meditation, and we have to see that we finish our work in the night and then we do little meditation and then we sleep off. Without meditation, you cannot grow and that’s why everything doing you have to know that you have to get up in the morning, do your meditation and then you can take to your work, daytime if you want you can rest for a while. Now we are in such a place that we have time to rest for a while, but morning time you have to get up whatever time you sleep. You have to conquer your sleep a little bit, it gives you lot of lethargy. Last night I don’t think I slept before 3 o’clock or something like that and then the whole day I’ve been busy writing reports, this, that, if I can manage at this age at your age you should be able to manage something like that. We have no time to sleep, we have no time to discuss, argue or to eat our food. We have only time to meditate that’s all.

I wish all of you absorb my saying and understanding without reacting to it. Please do not react. Don’t think “Mother is trying to chastise you”. No, I’m trying to help you to grow, this is the way you grow sometimes very fast. So it’s just your growth I am worried about and nothing else.

So, may God bless you all. I was very happy the way you were singing all the songs and the way you expressed yourselves.
