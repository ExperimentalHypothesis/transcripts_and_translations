I bow to all the seekers of truth.

Since ancient times, man has been searching the truth. He tried to search the truth in various forms of happiness. And he discarded many a times because he found that happiness was not permanent.
For a short time, he felt happy with something and he founds it also gave him great unhappiness. Like a lady, she had no child, so she used to weep and cry, and she had a child who late on dishonoured her. Then human beings started seeking happiness by enjoying the power, the power over other men, the power over other countries; that also they were not very much satisfied. Their children started feeling guilty about what their forefathers did.

Then the movement started seeking something subtler was in the art and music. That also had limitations. It could not give that permanent joy to people.

It is promised that one day we’ll all have to have this permanent joy. And then they started challenging all such people who had prophesised and who have been promising that such a day will come. So many reach the conclusion that there is nothing like joy. The life is all the times two sides of the waves, like too faces of a coin, they though that happiness is always combined with unhappiness, like day and night. Despites all these conclusions, human beings did not give up their search. They were seeking still and indulging into all kind of enterprises, jump into all kinds of dangerous things, followed all kinds of cults and gurus, but they could not find that joy.

This joy resides within us in another realm of which we are not aware. At the human awareness, we cannot feel that joy. Human awareness is only judged by our mental projections. All our experiences are based on our satisfaction of our ego or our conditionings. We project our mind, imagine something, and start following that. All human institutions are nothing but projection of the mind which is a limited myth. We are identified with different kinds of ideas, thought, theologies, they are all mental projections. All those who came from higher awareness also we dissolved them into these mental projections. Even the great scriptures were transcribed through these mental projections. But this mind is a limited thing which cannot enter into that subtle, where we have to find the source of joy, the Spirit.

As you know that if you have to study microbiology or histology, you have to use a microscope. In the same way, if you have to know about the divine Forces, and the divine laws, how they act, you have to become first the Spirit.
The mental projection is a very dangerous thing sometimes. That can form a big barrier away, very much away from reality. To transcend this barrier, one has to forget the mind for the time being. But whatever is unknown is not divine. If there is a mad man, he also has forgotten his mental, but he is not divine. Or a person who is possessed is also not a person with divine understanding. So one has to understand that, when it is said: "You have to know" it doesn’t mean that you have to know through your mind. You have to know through your Spirit. So it is most important that you have to awaken your Spirit within yourself.

Now we have so many artificial methods by which we start believing that our Spirit is awakened. Like in India, we have one custom called "yajno pavita" where we say that "this child has now become a Brahmin" means a Realized soul. We have, among Christians, the baptism. It is not a real happening. It is just, just an artificial drama. In the same way they have, in the Islamic, rituals, same in the Jew's. Every religion has this problem that they are indulging into artificial rituals.

Now what is the real ritual? If we have to become the Spirit, it is definitely an evolutionary process. If it is an evolutionary process, it has to be a living process. Logically then, this real evolutionary process is beyond human beings. How did we become human beings from amoeba? Can you imagine? We were all amoebas, small little unicellular animals and today we are human beings! What did we do to become human beings? Nothing, it is all a gift. The whole thing was so spontaneous and living. So whatever has to happen to you has to happen spontaneously. All the spontaneous things are living. Nothing dead is spontaneous. So what is the criteria, to understand how we become higher person? When we have become higher people than animals, we have a better, subtler awareness. That is, in our central nervous system, we can feel many things which animals cannot feel. If you bring a horse to Paris or to London or to any dirty place, it makes no difference to the pour horse. If you take him through a dirty lane, he will walk very nicely like a king. But human beings can’t just step, even one step forward in that lane. So the awareness of the human beings have to rise higher, that you have to become something much more than what you are. That is what is self Realization, when you know yourself, you must at least know what are you inside, otherwise you don’t know yourself.

When we say: "I like this, I like that" it is our ego, Mister ego that likes that, or may be it’s our conditioning that likes it. We don’t know what we are using to like something. Even hen we say: "I believe" mostly the politicians use the words "I believe". Now what believes? It’s their ego or their experiences out of their conditionings. But is has no absolute value.
If there’s a dirty thing, every body will smell it and say: "It’s dirty." As every body, who has eyes, will be able to say what is the colour of this curtain. But when we talk about these things, we are not talking about absolute things at all, because there’s so much difference of opinion. So logically again, we have to know something that is absolute and those who know that, all of them must agree to that point.

All the chaos of the world and all the problems of human beings is very simple, it’s because they do not know themselves. One brain is fighting another brain. Nation wide also some brains fight other brains. And this mind is surprisingly so funny he tries to find out ways and method of fighting only. So there must be something [that] God must have created within us or the nature must have created within us that we are not left in this transition period. We are actually in a state of suspension if you see that. It is such a problem that people don’t understand also what is to be done to be right.

Because of mental projections, our life is absolutely relative, we live relatively and always we discuss things relatively, there’s no absolute to say that this is how many times.
As a child, I had learnt that in Paris, there is a meter which is an absolute meter [the zero point of the French roads from which all the calculations are done] and from that, people can measure out how many times other meters are. And it is made of gold which has very little expansion because the coefficience is very low.
Translator: Platinum, actually. [The translator does not understand.]
Shri Mataji: Hum? Platinum, sorry. It’s very little coefficience.
But the absolute has to be that which is not going to expand or going to become smaller, it is absolute. Now from science, you will know that we cannot reach absolute zero in temperature. We cannot achieve absolute vacuum. Now, how are we to achieve our absolute if this is the situation with ordinary material things?
So first, we have to forget that we can achieve it. Now, to say that also: "We have faith in God, now we have faith in divine, and that will work it out" is also not possible. Even faith in God itself is a mental projection. If you ask any atheist he’ll tell you: "This is only because you are born in a family which was religious, that’s why you have become like this, otherwise there is no God."

When Lord Buddha came on this earth, he found the problem very intricate about God. Every body was talking that they know God and everybody’s God was different. And in the name of God, they were raising wars. So he decided that don’t talk of God anymore now because everybody wants to pocket him. Better not talk of God at this moment when they are not knowing about their Spirit. So he just talked of the Self, the Spirit. What he says: "Buddham Sharanam Gachami." I surrender myself to Buddha, Buddha means "the one who knows, the one who has the knowledge". It’s a Realized soul.
In Sahaja Yoga also, we go step by step. First of all, we have to know our Spirit, not through mental projections, but with the spontaneous happening.

....endocrine system. They have a much deeper significance than the plexuses which are only manifesting on a physical level. These centres also cater to our emotional being. They also cater to our mental being, and they also cater to our spiritual being. So whatever condition we are in, it is due to the condition of these subtle centres within us. These subtle centres that are placed within us, you can’t see with naked eyes or through any human machinery. They are energy centres and made of three types of energy within us about which I’ll tell you tomorrow. But today we have to know that they are such centres within us and the most important thing is that within us lies another third power which we call as Kundalini in Sanskrit language. Now this Kundalini has nothing to do from what place you come, country you come or whatever language you follow. It is called Kundalini because "kundal" means "coils". This is an energy within us, this is the energy of desire, desire which is pure desire.

We have so many desires. We want to have a house, then when we get the house we want to have a car, when we have a car we want to have an helicopter. So, as you understand economics that wants are not satiable in general. Now, actually, when this desire, which the pure desire is awakened, you get your absolute desire fulfilled and the absolute desire is to become one with the Whole. This desire is to become one with the Divine. This divine Power, I call it divine, you may not call it divine, but it is an all pervading Power.
We come in the garden and see so many flowers, we take it for granted. And when we see the flowers becoming fruits we take it for granted. How they have become fruits? Can we transform a flower into a fruit? We cannot. But somebody, some energy has done it, that must be the Energy all pervading everywhere. And remarkably, it has such a nice discretion, for example, a mango tree will only produce mango, not apples.
So this Energy which is doing all the living work of the world, all the autonomous work in our body itself, which has made us human beings from amoeba, this Power, we have never felt before. So when you get your Self Realization, for the first time, you feel that Power, that all pervading Power of divine love. This you cannot feel otherwise.

It is very easy to believe in something false, we believe more into false than into reality, that appeals to us much more. But reality is the one we should try to achieve. If we have to feel this breeze or this breeze of the Holy Ghost as they call it, then what are we to do? Some people think that we should go for a fasting or a vegetarian food, or starve ourselves or kill ourselves.

Such people only can become thin and die or become mad at the most. There is no need to torture yourself. This human body is made with great understanding. It is beautifully, delicately made, it is made with great care, with a very special purpose that you have to be the temple of the Spirit, that the light of Spirit has to shine within you. It is not for you to venture into all kinds of funny things that human beings are doing.

I don’t know if you have heard about a terrible disease in America, called AIDS, that has come in. It is spreading very fast and it is the result when man has said: "What’s wrong?" "If I cut my noise, what’s wrong?" But can you even create one cell of your nose? We have no right to disturb this beautiful mechanism that God has given us. We have to respect ourselves, because you are the epitome of His creation. Only you are going to become Realized not the chickens. Let us be kind to ourselves than towards other animals and things, and to other human beings. That is much more important, because this is the precious flower that God has created to become the fruit. People ask Me many a question: how is it, in ancient times, people had to work very hard and only one would get Realization. In ancient time, if you had to go from Paris to London, you would never reach. But today, how easy it is that we are even going to the Moon! Whatever has grown outside so much has to grow inside also. A tree that has grown so big, if it does not look at its roots, it is going to fall off and get destroyed. The same thing is going to happen to our modern civilization if it does not bother about its roots and tries to develop those roots on which this tree is standing.

Also, I must tell you when there is a blossom time, there are thousands and thousands of flowers, but when the tree is just planted you might get one or two. So many great souls have taken birth to become the fruits. That is the reason why we are having en masse Realization. Thousands of people are getting Realization and settling into it.

Today, I have told you as an introduction to Sahaja Yoga, "sahaja" means, “saha” means "with", "ja" means born. It is born within you, and "yoga" means unions with the Divine. So it is the right of every human being, because this is born within him, to have the spontaneous yoga. This is not a new method. Like a seed that sprouts, your Kundalini also gets awakened. But in the olden days, it was available to very, very few people. But now the time has come for all of you to have it.

Tomorrow I will be telling you about the three channel and the three Powers within us and about the Spirit that resides in our heart. I hope within these three days, you all will get your Realization. But the problem is that people again start putting mental projections on Sahaja Yoga also or they want to avoid themselves. They are afraid of the reality, they are afraid of themselves. I must tell you that you are the most beautiful thing. You have to just discover your glory within yourself. Once you’ll discover that, you’ll forget all these thoughts which make you so hopeless. After all we have to know that if God has created us, He has to jolly well look after us also. And if he is God almighty, He is the one who is going to save us all. Cause His creation will be destroyed.

Sahaja Yoga has worked wonders and I hope, in Paris, if it works, it will be a very great thing for the whole of Europe. Around Paris, we have many Sahaja Yogis. But those who live in Paris live in another world, likely. They come to My lecture, perhaps they’d like to have some mental projections here also. But I request you, you’d better have your Realization, whether in Paris or anywhere, you’d better have it. And settle down with it. You will enjoy your own powers and the powers of the Divine. You will know all the divine laws expressing themselves within you. Then you will know that all the scriptures of the world can be proved to be true. If a blind person tries to understand the colours, it s so difficult to explain; in the same way, unless and until you have Realization, you cannot understand any scriptures.

May God bless you all tonight and I hope tonight we’ll try to achieve that Realization. But it is not that once you have achieved it, you are permanently there, because, you see, people in modern times are very wobbly. And so many things have gone into their heads that they are lost. So it’s better to find yourself properly. And for a change, give some time to yourself.
May God bless you all.

If you have any questions, today being the first day, I would invite questions if you have. But ask sensible questions not like "in this book it is written" "and he says so and" no quarrelling any more. Just ask a honest question to yourself: "How I found my Spirit? If not, let me find it." Also no use saying: "I’ve been finding out and finding out". But if I say: "It is just here" Why go about with your seeking? It will just happen to you in a split of a second. There is nothing to feel nervous about it. It’s a beautiful happening because this is your mother. She doesn’t create any problem but solve all your problems, physical, mental, emotional. Sahaja Yoga has cured cancer, myelitis, all kinds of incurable diseases. And I’m sure it can also cure this horrible disease AIDS. Once you become Realized, you can cure others also and give Realization to others.
Today I met many people who are from around Paris whom I’d never met before who are Realized and nicely stationed in Sahaja Yoga as masters of Sahaja Yoga. It was such a great joy for Me.
Thank you very much
