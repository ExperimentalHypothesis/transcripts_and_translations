[Nirmala Vidya - 1987-0105 Dr Rustom Q and A Ganapatipule (second track)]

Question: Could you tell us something about the seats of chakras on the head? [unclear]

Dr Rutom: You see, the body is like the area of a government in a state. The head, the Sahasrara is like the head office where all the commanders of the various districts actually sit and live and have their seats. They communicate with each other. When they need to, they can descend into that part of the body where the chakra is, like an official going on a tour to sort out his area. Now the seats of all the deities are in Sahasrara and that is why they [unclear] to communicate with each other. [unclear] Agnya here, is front Agnya, here is [unclear, Yogesh] the Vishuddhi, here in the centre is the heart and here at the back is the Nabhi and here [unclear] is the Ganesha the Mooladhara and surrounding them on either side are the two Swadhisthana as left on left, right on right. Now, this is the structure of the chakras on the head. Now, from this, you can see the [unclear] left Swadhisthana [unclear] is caught on this side by instance it can entrap the ego, and when the right Swadhisthana is caught it can entrap the super-ego. Hence, people who are caught on left Swadhisthana in fact often manifest through the ego where there is a direct connection and they typically [unclear] all sorts of nonsense. I think many people have seen this. And the Mooladhara is here also, you see. And regarding left Swadhisthana, you cannot clear out the left Swadishthana until you have cleared out the Mooladhara chakra, or until the Mooladhara chakra is opened, the only chakra [unclear] is the Mooladhara. [unclear] something people have to understand, and the best way to clear the Mooladhara chakra is to take the mantra of Lord Ganesha four times, not three times, and you can all try this now, to sing the mantra of Lord Ganesha four times. When you say the mantras, I mean it’s OK to sing them but, if you sing them as a ritual it just takes you to the left. I prefer just to say mantras normally, unless one is doing a puja to Shri Mataji. So, you can say it like this:

Om Twameva Sakshat

Shri Ganesha Sakshat

Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

Shri Nirmala Devi

Namoh Namah

They repeat it four times.

Om [unclear] Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Bagawati Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namah

When you say it at the end, you just [unclear] them all together. [unclear] the left Swadhisthana.

People sitting on the ground will feel this most. From the [unclear] you can all see that the left Swadhisthana is connected with the left Vishuddhi, from here to here, and that also gets caught up when you have left-sided problems. Put your hands [unclear, out].

(Long Silence)

Dr Rustom: The power of the left Swadhisthana was worked out especially in the time of Prophet Muhammad because the part of Arabia in which He was born, the [unclear] is a part that is [unclear] to Africa, which, as we know, is the left Swadhisthana of the Universe. The Prophet was born as the representative of the void, as being Shri Dattatreya, he worked more on the left [unclear, than] the right void, hence the symbols of the moon and the veena, you see, which are both left-sided. His first wife, Khadijah, was the goddess Shri Mahakali who is the ruler of the left side, and she gave birth to goddess Shri Mahalakshmi as Fatima who is the ruling deity of left Swadhisthana, and, she married Shri Hazrat Ali who was the incarnation of Lord Brahmadewa, Lord of the right Swadhisthana. So, at the time of the prophet, Lord Brahmadeva was given two great shaktis, Mahalakshmi and Mahakali to work out the left Swadhisthana. And, this indicates that an important part of working out left Swadhisthana is the power of the Agnya because Shri Fatima was in fact the Virgin Mary. And, at the other side, Shri Mahasaraswati was born as Aisha the Prophet's second wife, and She was the one who by acknowledging [unclear] things tried to avoid the difficulties of the left Swadhisthana. So all these took place in fact in Arabia, and Arabia in fact is the land where left Swadhisthana works out most strongly, and the colours they use, especially for covering the Kaaba, black and gold, are often the colours that can work out the left Swadhisthana.

Do you feel the left Swadhisthana is clearing out, your left side is cleared out? Yet we have not used the mantra of [unclear, the/left] Swadhisthana at all.

Next, please.

Question: Can you have a word about discrimination, and how to increase our discrimination sense?

Dr Rustom: You see, again, discrimination is a function of the Kundalini. It is there [unclear] to work automatically. The seat of the discrimination is in the Hamsa Chakra, [unclear] everyone knows this, and you have to know how to work out, how to make the Hamsa Chakra strong. Now we know that the Hamsa chakra lies here, OK? Now, the things that make the Hamsa chakra strong are -  first of all, you have to put ghee here or any sort of oil. It straightens the nerves there. The second thing that keeps the Hamsa Chakras power is perfume, fragrance put into the nose, things like a balm or any sort of natural perfume. I don’t mean the various colognes and aftershaves that you buy at the shops. I mean the pure essences, pure oils, which I think now are available in most European cities. That also strengthens the part of the Hamsa. Now the Hamsa works like this; the two nadis go from the Hamsa and expand into many little nadis which pass through the brain before coming out at the back, you see. So we do pranayama. That also straightens the Hamsa. In the name of Shri Mataji, you do pranayama. Breathe them through. People will teach you how to do that. That also clears out the brain, you see? Because the Hamsa in fact is one of the chakras which cleanses the brain.

And another thing that you can use is ‘neti’, which is pouring salty water into one nostril and letting it come out on the other nostril. That also cleans the Hamsa. Sucks things out of the brain. Then the third thing that you can do is - the Hamsa is very closely connected with the eyes, especially the inner canthus of the eyes, is connected in some way with the Hamsa. Hence, the tears flow through the channel into the nose and come out and cleanse the Hamsa. And if you create artificial tears by putting in kajal or [unclear] or honey into the eyes. That also clears out the Hamsa chakra. And you must especially concentrate on the inner canthus here, and here, so, you start like this and go out, and make sure that it’s well-connected [unclear, here]. And that is why dirt, you see, in the eyes collects here, and you take it out. And, these are various techniques to strengthen the Hamsa. And, if you strengthen the Hamsa, the part of discrimination will work automatically. Like all the other parts of the body, it has to work automatically.

Next one.

Question: Dr Rustom, Shri Mataji speaks quite a lot about the powers of the conscious mind as a part of our awareness [unclear]...

Dr Rustom: The power of the conscious mind is where the conscious awareness becomes aware of all these things that are going on automatically. OK? So, where can perceive that which is coming in, and knows what it is doing, and can decode the information. This only occurs when the Agnya is highly developed. When the part of the conscious mind perceives things, you can then sometimes work out consciously how to strengthen chakras by seeing connections and interconnections, like when I described to you how the Hamsa is cleansed. This is done by conscious awareness by seeing connections between different parts of the Kundalini system, OK? And then using that consciousness to direct the body to work things out, like for instance putting kajal in your eyes is a conscious act. The thing is that most conscious acts, they often pass into the unconsciousness once they have become established as part of this structure of the being. Another way when the conscious mind acts is by perceiving the problem. It can then throw the problem upwards into the Sahasrara, into the awareness, and live it for the tantra to work things out. Another way the conscious mind works is by straightening the tantra. You can see a weakness in a part of your body and then in conscious meditation or in meditation get to the conscious mind the information whereby, a sort of inspiration, whereby you know how to cleanse this part or how to strengthen this loophole and in using that awareness which has come into your conscious mind to do that which you have become aware of. So, these are the parts of the conscious mind. The conscious mind to some extent is connected with the awareness. The difficulties are that sometimes the conscious mind gets captured by the ego, and that’s why difficulties sometimes arise.

Next.

Question: [inaudible]

Dr Rustom: Buddhi is intelligence, actually. The conscious mind uses buddhi, especially pure intelligence - shuddha buddhi to work things out. If you like, intelligence is one of the vehicles of the conscious mind, but the conscious mind is really awareness. It’s a simple thing.

Question: Can you discuss the relationship of karma to the individual ego, and to the individual's personality?

Dr Rustom: In Sanskrit, karma means that which needs to be done, which has to be done, and karma is a result of lots and lots of events happening to you which produces reactions within you which therefore seize to manifest themselves through the active agent in your being which is the ego. This is [unclear]. And this is the meaning of samsara, as when your ego acts then there is a reaction to the action of your ego and that gets stored up [unclear, once for all] in your left side and changes the nature of your desires. I hope people understand this.

For example, you may have a desire to buy something or to have something, say roast turkey for Christmas. And you have your roast turkey for Christmas. And perhaps been burnt, and that experience is [unclear, fit] into your left side, and it will affect whenever you want roast turkey again next Christmas. So, very,  [unclear] putting it. But that, basically, is the process that is going on all the time in human beings. Now, what happens? You see, the karma is something individual. When you go into meditation, these desires reappear as daydreams, [unclear, thing that], the first question that we were asked. [unclear, But if you] witness them, you see, they won’t go/flow into your ego, and they don’t lead to actions. Rather, they go out through the Sahasrara and they are lost. So, that is one way of dissolving the karma, is to meditate. That’s why meditation is so important. Especially the meditation with the right hand on the ground, because all this stuff can to be sucked out. Basically, if you want, karma is stored up in the left side, and if you want to release yourselves from the bonds of the karmas which is necessary if you have to get total liberation, you have to work on the left side.

Same questioner: [unclear] personality...

Dr Rustom: Well, your personality, is obvious [unclear] because your personality is made of your desires, and your fears, and your previous conditionings. If you have been bitten by a dog, you always will be afraid of a dog, if you had an unhappy marriage in your previous life you will be always afraid of marriage. So, I mean, you can see it’s a mosaic of so many previous experiences.

Anyone else?

Question: Dr. Rustom, how can we straighten our Mooladhara chakras?

Dr Rustom: You see, there are many ways to strengthen our chakra. OK? Now, this is when you use your conscious ego. You say; “I want this chakra to be strong!”

One of the ways is to take the mantra of the deity. It’s a very important way without, - because you see, unless your chakra is strong you do not know how to straighten it, it’s a paradox.

So, by taking the mantra of the deity, you see, you leave it to the deity who [unclear] how to strengthen your chakra, which makes life much easier for yourself. I think that’s the strongest way to straighten the chakra and then, as your awareness of the chakra expands, which [unclear] if you take the mantra of the deity, other means of straightening that individual chakra will come into your mind. As you know, each chakra is related to one of these five elements, and you can use those elements to strengthen your chakras. In the case of the Mooladhara chakra, the element is the earth so, you sit on the earth. Then you begin to see other means of strengthening the chakra. You can do physical things, like putting kumkum on it, you can put perfume on it [unclear, because one of the] qualities of the cause [unclear] of the Mooladhara chakra is fragrance. Another quality that the Muladhara chakra has is cleanliness, so you keep your body clean, which means bathing many times a day if it is necessary, then, like this, you go on and on and on. It’s much better to work on the chakra directly rather than trying to keep your eyes on the ground and castigating yourself every time you have a bad idea [unclear] these things don’t get you anywhere. If your chakra is strong, you won’t have bad ideas, you know. So, it is better to work from inside rather than outside. If you work on the bad ideas, it’s working from outside inward, which newer works in Sahaja Yoga. You have direct access to the deity of the chakra, you have direct access [unclear] of the chakra, work on those, and they’ll work outwards, [unclear] cleanse the chakra, then you have the bija mantras of the chakras which [unclear, which are known] of most Sahaja yogi. I mean, the information should be available now in any centre. There is the tape made by Shri Mataji about eight years ago I think if you remember. So, all these things exist you see, [unclear, means for] clearing the chakra. And as you go on and on as your awareness expands you find more, more ways to clear out any individual chakra. But the essence of the Muladhara chakra, as I said yesterday, is total surrender to the powers of the divine, the Absolute, the way a child is surrendered to the divine to the Absolute. Muladhara chakra is also in a way the chakra of the creation because it is the earth element, the gross material creation. And, one of the ways to strengthen the Mooladhara chakra is by love for the creation and by nurturing the creation. The Muladhara chakra consists of pure worship also, and devotion certainly straightens the Muladhara chakra, and worship in a sense in an atmosphere or an [unclear, aura] of holiness. The awareness of one's being has been holy, has been the temple of God, and is very important for the Muladhara chakra. That’s why Lord Christ said that your bodies are the temples of God, of the atma, you see. Lord Ganesha, you see, is born of the Mother, and ascends to worship the Father in the Agnya, which is a way of saying that - His whole life in fact is devoted to the worship of the Absolute in its form of Mother or Father, and if your whole life is devoted to the worship of the Absolute then the Muladhara chakra has to strengthen. I think it is very gross to think of the Muladhara chakra being only concerned with sex. I mean, if you are sexually perverted or doing anything wrong sexually, these can be easily overcome by the power of holiness. If you just surrender yourself to the power of the divine, this thing will go away. In fact, a Sahaja yogi shouldn’t feel any [unclear] of such problems because this takes your attention downwards. You should ignore such a problem, and [unclear] in meditation and worship Her. And the very act of being in that you will get rid of all these other problems that exist, which [unclear] takes seriously. If you worship in an atmosphere of holiness, your awareness hasn’t time to go to other things. But if you try to suppress yourselves, you see, you have to know yourselves means facing yourselves, with all your false and weaknesses. Sometimes could be a very unpleasant experience to know that you are this, but there is no alternative until you know and accept that you are ‘this’ you cannot change it. Because one of the essences of Sahaja Yoga is honesty, and [unclear] the Muladhara chakra is [unclear] honesty and truth, and you have to be honest and truthful with yourselves. There is no room for hypocrisy. The Muladhara chakra is anti-hypocrisy because of hypocrisy, [unclear, is no place for] innocence. And finally, the Muladhara chakra is about love because [unclear] Lord Ganesha is created in such a way that He knows every aspect of His Parent's creation, of His Mother's creation. But love means love, and love has to express itself. Sometimes the most powerful forms of love are silent because they create waves of [unclear] around you which affect the object of your love. I mean, the love is not individual but collective and not personal, then it becomes even more powerful. When you love a person simply because that person belongs to a certain category of people, for example when you love all Sahaja yogis because they are Sahaja yogis not because they are A or B or C, and you love all seekers because they are seekers. This sort of impersonal collective love also is a part of the Muladhara chakra, and you can see that it is the opposite of the personal and destructive love which people sometimes, - so-called love - which people get into. You see, [unclear] personal love which has nothing to do with the person with individuality, then that destroys the other so-called love which people have. It’s obvious, I mean they are opposites to each other, they cannot coexist. That is why it is so easy for people who have a good Muladhara chakra to marry anyone that is given to them. The very [unclear] that that person is a man and is given to them in the form of a husband is enough because that involves that impersonal collective love which exists between every wife and every husband. That’s why [unclear, the power of] a strong Muladhara chakra transcends. The Muladhara chakra, actually, is the foundation of collectivity because Lord Ganesha sees only the whole of His Mother's creation and his Mother, and he’s not concerned with any individual, he’s only concerned with individuals in the way they are connected to [unclear, his Mother]. Hence, someone who has a strong Muladhara chakra only sees people in relation to Shri Mataji. He’s not interested in the individual. And this saves you from a lot of pitfalls. Pitfalls in Sahaja Yoga arise with individual relationships that go beyond the maryadas which I described to you. When you see in individual as being more important [unclear] the collective as expressed through Shri Mataji. These are all very important functions of the Muladhara chakra. Surrender, you see it’s a combination, it’s very hard to describe it, but [unclear, it’s of], surrender of devotion of love and all these things give rise to purity. You have to see purity as being the result of love. Do you understand what I mean? It’s like a fruit, is a fruit of a tree, you’re trying to create the fruit without the tree [unclear] doing nonsense. If you try to attain purity without establishing the qualities of the Muladhara chakra which are love, worship, holiness and devotion [unclear, towards] Mother [unclear, surrender], then you can’t do it. [unclear] is like getting a chicken before the egg. That’s why it’s so important to go to the root of the Muladhara chakra to take the root mantra of the Muladhara chakra and in that way to strengthen, and then the powers that had been awakened in that way will produce their secondly and [unclear, thirdly] effects as [unclear] ripples going out, and you will get strengthened, not the other way round.

Next question?

Question:  [unclear] can better change because [unclear] a lot of minds came thinking this way that way, hiding behind it.

Dr Rustom: Inactivity is internal, and lethargy is external. Inactivity doesn’t mean that the body doesn’t move, it means the Spirit remains still. Sometimes the most inactive persons can become the most active physically. In inactivity, the awareness is clear, in lethargy the awareness is fogged, and you can see it in the face of a person. A man, who is inactive, is - has a [unclear] on his face. A man, who is lethargic has greenish or bluish colours to his skin, the left-sided people. Right-sided people become red. So, these are the - that is what I mean actually, and it’s up to you, you see, I mean every individual has a power of discrimination, every individual who has awakened, every individual who is realised. If you wish to delude yourself, as I said, a part of the Muladhara chakra is honesty. If you wish to lie to yourself about yourself, then no one can stop you, and it’s your responsibility, then you [unclear, ended] as slippy soap, downwards, from which it’s so difficult to escape because, once that movement it’s begun, to stop it, it’s very difficult until you [unclear]. OK.

Question: Some others find Bhajans quite difficult, especially late at night. Could you explain, firstly how it is helpful to us, or what is going on that is helpful to us, and secondly how  [unclear] to deal with this problem when it becomes a problem? How can one try to enjoy bhajans when time that feels that could be a little bit of a tapasya?

Dr Rustom: But it is tapas [unclear]. Really - if you find it difficult to stay awake when you have left-sided problems, and the whole concern of sleep seems a left-sided problem. [unclear] sleep, comes in when you have received a lot of vibrations, which is Yoga Nidra. A lot of people go to sleep immediately after the puja when the vibrations begin to work within them and change chakra and [unclear]. But the sleep comes in you, - well if [unclear] to handle [unclear] is to go to sleep. But don’t go home to sleep! Sleep there [unclear] and while you are sleeping you will clear out. That’s why bhajans had been created, you see? Because they are producing vibrations, especially when done in the presence of Shri Mataji, and those vibrations [unclear] make one sometimes very sleepy because they are working on the left side. If you can’t keep awake [unclear] go to the back and go off to sleep as long as is necessary and that is a good way to clear yourself out.

Question: [unclear] working on the Muladhara, here the mantra is of Shri Ganesha and Shri Ganesha Gauri. When to use which one?

Dr Rustom: [unclear] to speak about going to be asleep during bhajans.

Yogi: [unclear] I would like to answer or make a point on this thing in a slightly different way. It is tapas as had been mentioned by Dr [unclear] and it is necessary as Dr [unclear] said that [unclear] bhajans which is an expression of devotion to Shri Mataji that the chakras and the heart chakra and the name [unclear] vibrations which are there to you to take. They will come into you and can make you sleepy this is a common enough thing, it happens to each and every one of us, especially if the days are quite long and sometimes tiring. Whenever this happened, as to be, and I had the good fortune of being sitting in front of Shri Mataji, and She noticed us sleeping, the instructions came - sing along with the singers, clap loudly, take in the vibrations and [unclear] in ten minutes [unclear] or less than ten minutes [unclear] lethargy goes, your sleepiness goes, you’re with the collective, [unclear] tiredness and sleepiness is also one when you are feeling sort of pulled away from the whole collective, because the rest of the people are involved, the rest of the people are involved in the bhajans so, you have a choice.

(laugh and applaud)

Yogi: Thank you.

Dr Rustom: The essence, really, is to dispel whatever is in the left side. You can either do this by sleep, or you can do this by clapping. Clapping tends to work on the heart chakras and if sleepiness is something from very deep down, sometimes it has to work the other way. It’s up to you to work out how you do it. My experience was in the beginning, I used to sleep a lot, but now I don’t sleep so much as one's left side clears out.

There was a question, what was it?

Question: The question concerning the mantras of the Muladhara chakra [unclear, whether we] use Shri Ganesh and a few months ago we taught about Shri Ganesha Gauri.

Dr Rustom: By whom?

Yogi: It was on the mantra sheet.

Dr Rustom: Shri Ganesha Gauri tends to help more the Kundalini itself. And Shri Ganesha tends to help more the Muladhara chakra.

Yogi: So, you should discriminate between using which one [unclear]. I think [unclear]...

Dr Rustom: [unclear] feel yourself, I mean when you say a mantra, you should feel its effect.

Question: [unclear]

Dr. Rustom: Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Baghawati Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namah

Question: So, the question about another kind of sleepiness [unclear] experience is sometimes when we are with a group of negative people, negative individuals, we suddenly become sleepy. [unclear]

Dr Rustom: Again, I believe the best thing to do is to go to sleep. Sometimes if people are very heavily caught up on the left, one does go to sleep because they suck your awareness into their left side, I mean, in fact, you, I mean if you feel that sleepy that you can’t keep awake you [unclear just go, you have to go]. The danger in this form of thing is that if you are not strong, you will find it hard to come out of there, from their sucking into their left side. Actually, if you have a strong Agnya chakra, you won’t fall asleep that much because it’s the Agnya chakra that keeps the Ida and the Pingala in order [unclear] Sushumna. That rather than you are being sucked into the left side of the individual, you suck the individual back into the centre. But [unclear, it needs a very] powerful Sushumna and Agnya [unclear, which] allow you to do this. But sometimes Shri Mataji Herself goes to sleep when [unclear] a left-sided person [unclear] to find the way to clear it out. [unclear] any other thing. There is also a form of sleep when you suddenly feel very sleepy, and you go to sleep for five or ten minutes [unclear] Sahaja yogi, whomever you may be. That is normal] when Shri Mataji has described [unclear] of a Sahaja yogi [unclear] recover the strength.

Question: Dr Rustom, to strengthen and [unclear], is it important [unclear, for us] or not to meditate [unclear, on the Spirit] on the Agnya [unclear] our heart and [unclear] yesterday [unclear] into that or is it more important [unclear, to keep the] awareness in the heart centre at the same time?

Dr Rustom: Neither of these is going to help you much. The Atma is totally detached! It doesn’t love, it doesn’t hate. It has nothing to do with any of these qualities. The Atma is totally detached. Whether the Universe is saved or destroyed, the Atma remains always [unclear] about that all. Love, in fact, comes from other origins, and to try to concentrate in Sahasrara to produce love I think is not correct. One shouldn’t concentrate on anything to produce anything. That is a form of tantrism. Shri Mataji said to me, I remember last year, that any attempt to produce a specific effect in Sahaja Yoga, even by puja or mantras, [unclear] is a form of tantrism. There are two ways to work things out in Sahaja Yoga is, to say mantras with detachment, with emptiness, without any awareness of what the result is going to be! Rather than [unclear, ‘A’] mantra to produce [unclear, ‘A’] effect. Shri Mataji can do this, you see, She can tell you - take this mantra, take that mantra because She is the source the centre. But, there is a very fine dividing line in distinguishing between activity and inactivity of a Sahaja yogi but, this whole business of, you know, this whole industry is enough, [unclear, of the] concentrate on this to produce this and concentrate on that to produce that if you concentrate on this, this will happen this is tantrism.

Question: [inaudible]

Dr Rustom: Do you shoe-beating to get results, or do you just shoe-beat yourself to purify yourself?

[Inaudible]

Dr Rustom: I never shoe-beet in order to get a specific result. Never. I just shoe-beet in order to purify the situation. I’m not sure what purification the situation may need. You may shoe-beet a job to get the job. But maybe the purification of the situation is that you don’t get the job. And the same with the bandhan, exactly. You cannot do something to get an effect. That’s magic. The magic of tantrism. You can only do these things to purify a situation and leave the results to God. Only God knows what is [unclear]. That’s why people get upset when suddenly find [unclear, things] don’t work out. They always work. It’s just that they may not do what you want.

[laughter, applause]

Question: Dr Rustom, as a Sahaja yogi we have to be full of humility, kindness, and compassion to another person. But when we deal with non-Sahaja yogis [unclear] realise that they [unclear] and they take advantage of your humility. How to deal with them? [unclear]. Can we get angry with them or what?

Dr Rustom: I think that they take advantage of you because of your humility - so-called -  and you deserve it. There is also one aspect of God which is terrible and destructive. [unclear] the whole point is that one should neither be humble nor the opposite. One should just be as one is and live it to the powers of the deities within you to work things out.

There was one chap I remember in Sahaja Yoga [unclear] got cross with him. He gave me some trouble, and he was a married man and suddenly became impotent, he couldn’t satisfy any of his three wives, [unclear, because is] the Power of God working [unclear]. I never [unclear, did this] to him. There was a woman in [unclear] around us, objecting to my lighting the flame to do my pujas in my room, and that weekend the husband [unclear], his fingers were cut off [....]. I didn’t do that, but the power of God, and the power of God can be terrible also. So, God is not, you know, humble, and [unclear]. As Christ had said that -  “I came not to bring peace, but to bring a sword, to set father against son, and brother against brother.” So I think that there is a [unclear] of Sahaja yogi who believes that [unclear, if they go through life] humble, sweet and beautiful [unclear, they deserve flowers...] heaven. But often what they do is that they kill their fellow Sahaja yogi and [unclear] honey. That’s my answer to that.

Question: [unclear] say the mantra from the heart [unclear]...

Dr Rustom: You see, when [unclear, one says] a mantra if you say the mantra with the attention in the heart, then that is saying it from the heart. [unclear...] it is very powerful because, the heart is the [unclear] centre of the entire body. It begins in the heart and ends in the head in the Sahasrara. [unclear] to all the chakras in between. So, saying from the heart is like [unclear] the energy flows to every single chakra producing very fast an effect. That’s what is the meaning of - ‘by saying with the heart.’ That’s people misunderstand what I last told them [unclear], one shouldn’t (?) do destructive things. I'm not saying that. I’m saying that one should be neutral, and those shaktis, powers, who are present in you around you [unclear, as the] power of Shri Mataji, they will do [unclear, the destroying]. No individual Sahaja yogi has the authority to destroy anyone or at the same time to become anyone’s slave or servant. You are like the prince of the universe, you should behave like a prince of the Universe. You should not bow to anyone, except your Mother, and you should not destroy anyone. [unclear]. All these things will be done for you automatically.

Question: Yesterday, you had talked about [unclear]...

Dr, Rustom: How do you know (that) I do not know? Just as you know when you have the vision [unclear] the car is different from the tree, so you know when you have that vision [unclear] chitta, the buddhi and the ahankara [unclear, you know from where]. The capacity to see, I cannot teach anyone how to see [unclear] is just automatic.

OK, I think they have no more questions, I think they want to do the lunch.

Yogi: [unclear] a few things which came out from today’s talk [unclear]. This is like a University, [unclear] knowledge that we had been discussing [unclear] like this [unclear] India [unclear] holly place and talks about [unclear] attention. And you have come from many far lands, you come here to be here it’s a very great thing, great, great thing for us who live in India to have been able to welcome you and also to thank you for the gift that you brought, the presence the love that you brought with you. One thing as gifts that you have done is very interesting, that normally when say in Christmastime you are going to buy a gift for someone, you buy a particular gift in a particular way that satisfies your ego [unclear] satisfy that person’s ego [unclear] everything that you [unclear] Shri Mataji, She [unclear] great joy and enthusiasm. People [unclear] see Her in the form of Shri Lakshmi [unclear] giving things away. So, just on behalf of all the Indians who are here, I wanted to thank you. I just wanted to add a few things because, in the last four months, it has been a unique experience for me to have been very lucky to be with Shri Mataji almost all the time, and at least at most of the major talks and most of the major pujas and one thing that I found is that whatever set of minds that we are put ourselves in wanting to understand the divine, She starts manifesting in that form. One example is that before She came to India, there is a stotram written by Shri Shankara called ‘Dakshina murti stotram’ which some of you might have read. In the beginning line of that is that ‘ isn’t it amazing that under a tree sits the young guru surrounded by the [unclear] disciples. You see, Dakshina murti is Lord Shiva. His face is shining and inside us simply with the gesture of giving, imparting the knowledge, the hand gesture giving the knowledge.

Second part - 52:45’

Question: ... the depth of meditation.

Dr Rustom: The depth of meditation is immeasurable because the nature of meditation is the Absolute, which is infinite. How to reach it is by sinking into it in silent meditation without resistance and the desire for surrender through inactivity. Activity through inactivity, as Lao Tzu said. OK

*A yogi with the mike repeats the questions and answers: Another question.

Question: Can you elaborate on Nirvikalpa sthiti?

*The gentleman wants things to elaborate on Nirvikalpa Sthiti.

Dr Rustom: Nirvikalp, Kalpa means, the word, the Sanskrit word klp, which Kalpa comes from, means to make plans, to doubt, to make resolutions. So hence, - there is a saying, what’s it?  There is a saying, - something... something Kalpa - Vikalpa karumi.  God says, “I make your plans into nothingness. So Nirvikalpa Sthiti is a state where you do not doubt any aspect of your existence - either yourself or God, or your own nature. So everything flows automatically without your need to do anything. Now since Shri Mataji is God, It follows that, without having total undoubting faith in Her, you cannot attain Nirvikalpa. And, you have not simply in Her, Shri Mataji, but as Her, as the Divine, the Absolute and the whole of the creation put together. So until you do not doubt Her in these aspects, it is impossible to attain Nirvikalpa.

Yogi: Next question? Yes. ...

Question: ... the way to eliminate doubt.

Dr Rustom: The way to eliminate doubt is to know God, and to know that God sits before you in the form - to know it! - of Shri Mataji. To know it, really to know it as a fact of life, as the trees are green.

Question: What is the highest point of bhakti?

Dr Rustom: The highest point of bhakti is when bhakti disappears. Because bhakti is seeking to attain. But when you have attained, you have already reached the highest point. And then you have no need for it any more.

Question:  In the first question, you said that “you have to meditate without resistance”. Can you elaborate on that with an example?

Dr Rustom: You see, when you sit in meditation without resistance, what does it mean to sit there? Without expectation, without knowing what is going to happen. That is, (meditation) without resistance. And whatever happens, you accept it and witness it without any reaction. In detachment. Whatever vibrations flow to you, you accept them without analysis. And the results without analysis. You accept your transformation without any mental process or comparison, and that is meditation without resistance. Because in truth, one is in meditation in every moment of his life. That is meditation without resistance. The moment one begins to think -  am I meditating or not, then one's no longer meditating. Shri Mataji says one has to be helpless like a child, in Her speech at the puja, at this puja. Because only when you are like a child, can the powers of God act for you. If you insist on walking, God cannot carry you. So the essence of the Mooladhara chakra is surrender to God in the form of a helpless child to its Parent. And the essence of meditation begins and lies in the Mooladhara chakra and ascends to all the other chakras after that. That is meditation without resistance.

Question: One has to feel all these in the central nervous system? Can the state be elaborated on?

Dr Rustom: You see, the central nervous system is the means of perception of the body. In an unenlightened state, it perceives only gross things. When it is enlightened, it perceives subtle things. So, an enlightened brain can see vibrations, can know vibrations and know what to do for vibrations. But the old Sanskrit scholars, like Shri Sankara, made a distinction between buddhi, chitta and ahankara. Between one's intelligence, one's awareness and one’s ego. Nowadays, in the twentieth century, people think they are all the same. But the chitta is the enlightened brain, the buddhi is that which analyses and uses it, and the ego should be the instrument of the former two. But, in fact, in most people, it is the opposite. The ego tries to use these as its instruments. And this is where evil results from. Because the chitta and the buddhi of an enlightened soul is divine. And when the ego tries to manipulate the divine, then one becomes a rakshasa. That is it.

Yogi: I think the last portion was very important because that hits the nail on the head.

Question: When you reach the enlightened state, is the buddhi still there or does it merge with the divine and the vibrations?

Dr Rustom: You see, this question means that one doesn’t understand what happens at realisation, one doesn’t understand the meaning of enlightenment. One doesn’t attain it (enlightenment), it is given to one by the grace of God who is Shri Mataji. First thing you have to understand. And, this was made clear through the lives of Shri Mahavira and Shri Buddha, who could not attain it, but they were granted their enlightenment. The second is that the buddhi is just one of the many instruments of the body of the atman. In enlightenment, the atma is awakened by the Grace and Power of God and permeates the entire body in its three koshas (a covering of the Atman) enlightening it. So, it is not that the buddhi becomes divine, but the divinity enters the buddhi, and into all the other parts of one's being. That is how the buddhi becomes enlightened.       

Question: How to attain the total yoga?

Dr Rustom: You see, it’s very simple. The moment you are totally surrendered to the Absolute, you have attained that state.

Question: Could you explain the distinctions between awareness and attention?...

Dr Rustom: There is no difference between awareness and attention. They are the same. The Sanskrit word for them is the same - the chitta. Now, you see, the whole question of putting one's attention on things is in a sense wrong, because that is human activity. And all human activity tens to go against the divine. So rather, you let your attention go where it wishes, guided by the divine. One of the forms the divine took was in the form of Pārthasārathī, which was the charioteer of Arjuna, Lord Krishna the charioteer of Arjuna. And in that way - it’s a symbol that the divine is your charioteer. It doesn’t take arms for you but, it guides you into those fields of activity in which you use your capacities. Now, you know that the great instrument of all Sahaja yogis is the attention. It has unlimited weapons and powers. So, if you push it into a place, in the sense that you can misuse it. But if you allow it to go where it wishes, then it works of itself and doesn’t affect you. In the early days of Sahaja yoga, people are given the freedom to push their attention here and there, in order to feel what it is like. But at the more advanced and mature level, you allow it to carry you and to be your vehicle. That is the answer to your question, I think.

Question: Why the Mahamaya of Shi Mataji?

Dr Rustom: Without the Maya, there is no creation because as Shri Shankara said; “all is God and derived from God,” and if we were not deluded into forgetting that we are the spirit derived from God, where would the creation be? That is the answer.

Question: The realized soul goes to moksha - what exactly does that mean?

Dr Rustom: This is a difficult question to answer because moksha means liberation. Moksha consists in - not being deluded any more. And this derives from the fact that one can feel vibrations, and vibrations are absolute. If you are not deluded, therefore you should not sin. And the man who goes by his vibrations attains God. But this doesn’t mean that after realisation everyone does this. Many people still go on according to their old patterns of behaviour. And if this goes beyond the point, they can start the downward path to their destruction. So realisation means that we have the capacity to attain moksha, but it still depends on the way in which we use our human instruments. So this is the meaning of moksha and realisation.

Question: What is the meaning of pushing one's attention and being carried by the attention? Why am I asking this, is it because we are doing exercises in Delhi, is being carried by the attention, or we are pushing it?

Dr. Rustom: I don’t know what exercises these are.

Yogi: I will tell you. We are trying to bring, as you said in the beginning, that you have to put the attention, for education, and bring up to the initial state of the vibrations. That is what she ...pushing

Yogi is repeating the question: What is the difference between pushing one’s attention and being carried by one’s attention?

Dr Rustom: You see, I mentioned initially that one can push one’s attention as an exercise initially for the means of education. But for the means of ascent, one has to be passive and carried by one’s attention. Like Garuda carries one upward. Garuda is the vehicle of Shri Vishnu in His ascending form. And Lord Vishnu is the Lord of the Nabhi which is the seat of the attention. That is the answer to the question.

Question: Can you tell us something about the chakras, about the formless chakras above the Sahastrara? How does one recognise them? How can we attain them?

Dr Rustom: Since they are formless, we cannot recognise them. One can attain them paradoxically by pushing the attention up through them. But since you cannot recognise them, there is nothing for us to aim at. So, eventually, we invoke Shri Mataji in the form of the Shakti of these chakras and of the Shakti of the Kundalini and ask Her to do the job for us. And having attended them, one goes beyond this world of form and shade and matter, and hence one enters a different sphere, where these questions do not arise or have no meaning.

Question: What is the meaning of Nirananda?

Dr. Rustom: Nirananda, is the joy derived from Shri Adi Shakti. One has to understand joy as an instrument of the divine, expressing an aspect of its nature for the exultation of mankind. It’s not an end in itself. The ultimate state is a state of total repose without qualities or attributes. And when one is in that state, there is nothing.

Yogi: Sunya.

Dr. Rustom: Sunya. Now, sunya means void, emptiness. [unclear]. So, that is the meaning of Nirananda and the Nirananda state leads directly to that state of nothingness, which is the true nature of the divine.

Question: What is the meaning of Maha Yagya?

Dr Rustom: The Yagya is a fire sacrifice, from which vibrations are put into matter. A Maha Yagya is a great fire sacrifice because it is performed in the presence of Shri Adi Shakti.

Other question?

A yogi asks a question: (inaudible)

Dr Rustom: I can’t do that, sorry. Ask a specific question.

Dr Rustom: Any questions? [unclear].  How to not lose it, how can you lose it? The question is - how to not lose vibrations? I’m not sure what that question means.

Yogi: [unclear], to not get out of Sahaja yoga.

Dr Rustom: How to not get out of Sahaja Yoga.

Discussions between yogis on the topic ... how to maintain .... how to maintain the vibrations...

Dr Rustom: It is not an easy question to answer because basically, you have to do those things which are prescribed to you to do! But you see, I mean each case is different, and there are thousands of reasons why you can lose your vibrations. So, it is very hard to give a specific answer. You have to see what is the individual case. [unclear] I will start actually with the mantra to enliven people up. I will say the mantras. Reddy? OK

Question: [unclear]. Why do we never worship Shri Mataji as Shri Brahmadeva?

Dr. Rustom: We do, I think. Every time we take the mantra, we perform the Puja to Shri Mataji as Shri Brahmadeva. But generally, Lord Brahmadeva is not worshipped because it’s [unclear], His job is finished already. His job was to create the Universe - he has done it, and now He can rest.

Question: [inaudible]

Dr Rustom: You see, daydreaming is imagination. Imagination is unreal and usually is the form of your activated desires. Because daydream has something to do with the desire, doesn’t it? Now what happens is - that - when you are normally in existence, you have also those desires which exist in a potential form in your left side. They are based on your previous experiences and the fulfilment or lack of fulfilment of the past desires. They are all crystallised as potential desires on your left side. When you meditate, the vibrations go into your left hand, into your left side and activate these in the same way that a shining light through a hologram produces an image, and the vibrations working through you, as it were crystallised desires, produces these images in your brain. The thing to do is to witness them. Don’t you - you cannot suppress them because they are the natural path of clearing out the left side. And one can - people who particularly have left-sided problems will be prone to this. So, instead of fighting it, which just you know, activates a left-right battle, you just let them flow on you in the same way as water flows over one and after a period of time, you find that the nature of your daydreams changes, and after a while, they disappear, as the vibrations clear out your left side. And, if they are really distressing for you, you put your right hand on the ground, so these staff can be absorbed. So that’s the significance of daydreaming during meditation.

Question: Is there a similar phenomenon that occurs when you get sleepy during meditation?

Dr Rustom: Is the same sort of thing. When you get sleepy during meditations, sometimes again it’s a left-sided phenomenon where stuff on the left side is activated and grabbed to dislodge, and if you do get sleepy during the mediation, and you can’t bear it, the best thing is to do is to lie down, you may not fall asleep but is better to lie down, especially if you lie on your right side where allow these stuff to shoot out of the system. You see, and you may go into sort of half-sleep, then all these stuff is coming out, and you wake up very fresh after five or ten minutes then you carry on meditating.

Question: To recognise Mother as God is very important for our ascent, Is there a step-by-step way for us to do that?

Dr Rustom: Well, I think it occurs in a step-by-step way. To recognise is one thing, to know and understand is another thing. [unclear, I think] everyone recognises, but to know and understand what does mean, it takes a long time, and I think if you meditate regularly without resistance, you know, without action, you will get there in the end, because God Himself will guide you, you see. So, the main thing in Sahaja yoga is, to not try to do too many things too fast. You have to be patient. You have a whole lifetime ahead of you, and you deepen every day if you meditate properly. [unclear] to be sat for collective meditations, there’s also [unclear] a great thing to be sat for individual meditation because in individual meditation you develop your own capacities and personality and things which, if you do only collective meditations, you may miss out all, and you can’t go deep because every individual has his own history which is separate from the history of every other individual. And needs to be dealt with individually. So, I think if you do a certain degree of individual meditation as well as collective meditation, then you get some sense of who you are. People who meditate [unclear] only collectively tend to become shallow and superficial because the individual aspects of their nature are being ignored.

Question: Could you say a word about the difference between self-realisation and God realisation?

Dr Rustom: Self-realisation, you see, is when you know yourself. You know who you are, you know the chakras within yourself, your Kundalini is raised... God realisation is the knowledge, the absolute knowledge of the divine, and in cooperation to that, so, a level totally different, where the collective absorbs the individual. Because there [unclear] things that you have to realise in Sahaja Yoga, is that you get your self-realisation, and you think about yourself in relation to God. But people forget that this whole universe is created and run by God, that all its immensity and vastness, and if you are going to be God realised, you have to be able to encompass in your awareness the entire creation and its maintenance. And it’s a big step, from the individual to the collective. You have to know what the divine is working out, you see. And that requires a very great degree of detachment. Because you cannot appreciate the collective until you can go beyond the individual, when you cease to be concerned with individual concerns, only then you can go into the collective. So, one of the essence is, in fact, detachment and witness because without that you cannot rise above the individual.

Question: Shri Mataji said that we should be without discrimination as to whom we give realisation. What about children walking in the street [unclear] to raise their Kundalini?

Other yogi repeat the question: The question was - what about children? Very often, adults who got realisation [unclear] negative. Alright? What about children who walk on the street? You see on the street, you just raise the Kundalini without the kid knowing it, you know that he gets realisation without question you just saw the kid and give realisation. Is this something that we should do?

Another yogi repeats the question in a loudspeaker: Should we just give realisation to children who are walking along the street? Is this something ...

Dr Rustom: You see, I think that if you are in a state of meditation, you won’t notice people  [unclear] unless there is some need to notice them. You might suddenly be awakened by someone, and you have the desire to give this person realisation. [unclear] you can give them realisation, what in fact would tend to happen when you are always in meditation, is that automatically people get realisation without you being aware that you have done this. And, you see, the Kundalini does the discriminating, it is [unclear] decides who should get it and who shouldn’t get it, and that is in fact the way to do it. If someone asks you for realisation, I think it would be very hard to refuse. Because everyone has the right to ask for realisation. But after that, it is their responsibility to some extent. The thing about Sahaja Yoga is that if someone asks you for something, then unless this asking is the play of negativity, it’s very hard to refuse another human being because this will be held against you on the day of judgment. And I think as Shri Mataji tries to help everyone who comes to Her, so I think every individual Sahaja Yogi, has the duty to help every human being who asks for it to the ends degree, until such a point as you can’t do it any more. I think it is very dangerous for Sahaja Yogi to decide for oneself who deserves and who doesn’t deserve to be in Sahaja Yoga because the accumulated weight of all the souls you have cast out from the grace of God one day pulls you down. So I think that would be the answer to your question.

I think that the whole thing about Sahaja Yoga is that you have to serve. You have to understand this, you have to serve mankind, and you have to do this with discrimination. Another thing is that you mustn’t do those things which will weaken your capacity to serve mankind by getting involved with people who are overly negative if you cannot handle it. You see, that’s the opposite side, the left-sided thing. The right-side people hurl out people who don’t need to be hurled out, and the left-sided people drag in people who don’t need to be dragged in. There is no justification for dragging in someone who doesn’t want it. All you do is weaken the collective because the person becomes a burden.

I think that in future anyone who wants to ask questions, you come up here so they can ask their own question directly to the microphone, in that way, we can have a queue and sort it out. So anyone who has questions, just come stand here and as the chance, the opportunity arises we answer your questions.

Question: Yesterday, when speaking of going deep into meditation, we talked about surrender. Can you tell us any particular advice to increase our ability to surrender?

Dr Rustom: You see, if you are engaged in activity to increase your capacity to surrender, [unclear] it’s a paradox. The whole point of surrender is inactivity. So that would be the answer to your question, I think.

Question: I would like to have a comment on this. In the Vest when we are working on people or other Sahaja yogis are working on us, we make a bandhan first and also around them and I saw here Indians are doing it completely differently. We are a bit afraid of the vibrations of others. Here they very often take the hands of the others and absorb really the vibrations.

Dr Rustom: You see, I think that if you do a bandhan before working on someone, that is the best situation. And certainly, if you are new in Sahaja Yoga, you should never work in any other way. But if you get on in Sahaja Yoga, you get sufficiently strong, and you find that you can handle negativity when it comes to you, then people take shortcuts and don’t do it (bandhan). But when people hold each other's hands, they are not working on each other so much. In a way, they’re communicating through vibrations. I think that Indians don’t have this idea of working on someone consciously. When you work on a person, you see, it depends very much on my attitude to the person. One of the things that Shri Mataji said is that if you work on a person with pure love, then you never catch from that person as a mother never catches from her child. But the capacity for pure love, I think, is missing in the Vest because the moment when a human being comes near another human being, all sorts of other considerations begin to arise, of material form or sexual form, and the capacity to be in a pure relation form with another human being is very rare. And I think this is the reason why perhaps in the Vest one needs bandhan as more. But, certainly, it’s never wrong to do a bandhan.

Question: You had spoken yesterday of the formless chakras above our Sahasrara. Can you indicate the names of the deities of these chakras?

Dr Rustom: There are no deities. It is just the Adi Shakti. But, [unclear, I mean that they are] just powers, engines, you know, and the whole world of name and form is at a level [unclear, lower] than the level of the Absolute. We know that one has to go above these. The names that are given to deities in a sens, they are illusions. I mean, you know that God has no name because the name indicates a finite notion, the infinite is beyond that. And the whole point is that the Sahasrara is the [unclear] point between the abstract and the formed, the finite.

From here, Her Holiness Shri Mataji is speaking in Hindi. 1:40:10 for few minutes.

1987-0105 Rustom answering the questions Ganapatipule India DP-Opt HD

from the min 26.40 there is a sort talk of H.H. Shri Mataji until min. 30.02 then the Q&A continues.

The short talk of Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: ... much more tens than you were before. Some [not clear] also. That’s not a very good sign! I hope you all are very happy with the marriages. Try to make the best out of it. It is stupid to fight about something that is nonsensical. [You] must have [a] wider vision, [you] must have wider ideas and [you] must have [a] wider understanding that we are doing all this for Sahaja Yog, and we have to maintain a certain amount of decency and decorum about it. I’m sorry I have to send you to Puna because we could not arrange it anywhere else.

Now in Puna, you’ll be staying there for three days and two three nights, and you have to pay money there. In case you have any difficulties, you better tell your leaders now, for money or something you can tell your leaders, and then you can see what you can do about it. We had to have these arrangements, three days arrangements, because Gregoire was very insistent that just after our marriage we must have some place for these married couples otherwise they will [unclear] Me off. He, himself, is getting married, also.

[laughter, applaud].

Shri Mataji is laughing too.

Shri Mataji: So, now you cannot say anything to Me. But [the] money part, you better look after. Now, I will say, I will say that the people need any money or anything to pay for, or any problem there, you let him know beforehand, so they can organise something for you. But these had to be, there is no other way out, I’m sorry because there are only 22 suites of rooms available there, and they said that these rooms can only be available for all of you. So that, we should not do it. So, this is what it is, I hope you make your lives happier by enjoying yourselves for three days, and you are going there without the honey and the moon, I think. [laughter]

Yogi: The moon is here.

Shri Mataji: And the honey too.

Yogi: The honey too.

[lauhhter and applaud]

Shri Mataji: So, become better people, not dried out. You see, I don’t want you to have any complains because we worked very hard to match you people, and to arrange all the marriages. [Shri Mataji is laughing]. So, understand that we gain nothing out of it. You see, I don’t get any chance for a honeymoon [unclear]. [laughter and applaud] So, I would suggest that please make the best out of it, and that is a great chance for you to do all these things.

Now, those who are going to Puna should know the way they have to go. I would say that we have told Dumal to arrange it so, you’ll have to take the buses to Dumals place where, you know, I hope you know the Dumals place. (Shri Mataji is speaking in Marathi). He is going, one person. There are only two persons going ...

The questions and answers continue.
