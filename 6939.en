Talk to Yogis, Kew Ashram, Melbourne (Australia), 14 March 1985.

This is the best you can give to your friends, instead of giving them parties, dinners. That's how you become permanent friends.

So the children are enjoying themselves preparing the next occasion. Going to sit down with Modi today, and finalize the marriage program. All right? So I would like to have the names of the people who are getting married.  Ah. And I hope, they have everything all right. Because I will have to check up on these things, isn't it? Because day after tomorrow will be a puja and then we'll have to prepare for the weddings, that is on Sunday. Puja will be in the evening? What we can do if you want to have a sort of a follow-up program, we can have it on in the morning time.

Yogi: But Mother it will be too much for you.

No, I'll be out only for one hour at the most. That's you see because I think the contacts are lost. If you don't say I'm there, I'm not there, then they don't come. So best is to have one day. I'll just come for an hour outside that's all. Keep it like that, we'll manage somehow. Yes, last time did we cook? So many, we cannot. So they should be left out. See they should come here at the time about say ten o'clock and leave about twelve o'clock, so they don't need anything. So that's why you were saying we will have the - Monday, when am I flying? That's why you wanted to have the marriages, first, on Saturday. Was that the idea? 

Saturday the marriages, and then Sunday morning is people coming over.  All right, if you think so - because on a wedding day, you see there is a shopping, people are out. Then better to use that for the wedding day. All right. So we can have the marriages on Saturday. But you need time, you see, to prepare. Today is, what tomorrow is Friday. Saturday then we can keep for marriages. One advantage will be that the shops will be open. If we need anything we can get it on Sun, Saturday, all right? We can have it Saturday morning. We can have it on Saturday. All right, we'll do that way. All right. Because have the same tent. See now he's saying Saturday evening marriages. Sunday morning is people going out, workshop evening time. I would say it would be better then.  All right, but it would be very hot in the morning time, ten to twelve, very hot  I am. Something has to be worked out. Why don't you have puja in the morning time? You see, in the cooler times we can have it, so that it will have much more effect, on these people. You see, because before puja to have the bhoots on your head is not good. Like just now I'm having a headache. So see, it's best to finish the puja, marriages, all auspicious things, and then have it. It will be cooler time also. All right?

See now it was real headache, I tell you, that woman. She was really, I think, not a very good housewife or something, and she could not forgive her husband, bit too much of anger. Feel it Warren? It's all right, give her a bandhan, you see. It's all One has to bear. Very egoistical person, you see. The ego was so much that I was turning her Agnya. She wouldn't allow Me to turn it either. That's all. I see Warren we cannot choose - can we? All types are there. You see, just forget it, you see, just forget it  don't ... By thinking about it you will catch much more. Just forget it. Nobody should feel bad about it. You see, all kinds of people are there. You just can't say what it is.  Yes, that's it, that's all right,  but this will help, you know.  It's has to come out. Better? Is it? I was very happy to see them there. They are such a help, such a help. Ah, in India no child would miss My program, isn't it? Everybody is there, out, for any program. So when will they arrive, on Saturday morning? All right? So Saturday morning, how can you then have the puja? We'll have Sunday morning puja, is it? Or what is it? There is only preparations we will do here. All right? So we will have to prepare.  Also you see what is happening is the Sun, you know. Sun is giving vibrations. Also I sucked in that, quite a lot, and she just added a little bit, what I'd sucked in that's all. She just, I would say that she is responsible, the whole of it, the end of it. So much of heat was there, you know. Has to be sucked in.

So whatever I said about the school, you had a happy day with that. In that short time what can you say, you know? Actually the modern education is very ego-oriented. It creates more ego than love and compassion. I don't know. What we need is to teach children how to share, how to be compassionate, how to be collective. The education is not towards that, I think, modern education at all. But I have seen the Chinese have thought of these things. Chinese have thought. Though they do not give realisation, but they work it out that way. I don't need one, it's not necessary. All right. Warren. Really I don't need that - On others, not me, I'm all right. I'm quite good. It will cool down, Melbourne, I think. Really. And the summer? This kind of summer you never had. You must have a summer like this. Very important you see for the ecological balance. 

When you have such a summer then the Mother Earth sucks in you see, the rays of the sun you see and that, with that you see all the leaves which are dried and all that, they fall down and also nitrogen is given. So that's how she gets more enriched by the calcium because the vitamin D you see, that comes from the sun helps her consume the calcium and the nitrogen from the leaves that are there and that's how she enriches herself. Now you, if you have a good summer, a real nice summer then also you'll find you'll have a very beautiful autumn. Your autumn will show beautiful colours and hues and red and yellow; this and that.

Moreover this kind of a heat, you see, takes away the moisture of the Mother Earth, so the crusts are formed and many minerals are created with that. With the heat only the minerals are created out of the same. You see all the change takes place through the heat from the Mother Earth and the heat from the sun. It's better to have from the sun than to have from the Mother Earth because it can explode. Into a volcano or something. So you see all these things are worked out in such a way that you get definite seasons. That's important.

Otherwise like England all the time it's rainy season. They play also, they say, hockey with an umbrella on their head. I mean, we have many places like England in India, such a lot of ... thousands and thousands of miles, but it is not inhabited. We don't think it is inhabited because it is so cold, so windy, just rain such a lot, all the Himalayas. The foothills of the Himalayas are like that. We don't think it is very habitable, don't use them. I mean, when we can get one square foot of land there for about one anna, that is one sixteenth of one square foot, according to you. According to us, it's not beautiful. According to Indians it is not very beautiful. They think that, why should we fight the nature? Live in a place where you don't have to fight the natures. Even in Kashmir you will be surprised. People are there only for summer. All the winter they come down, to the plains. They don't stay. Otherwise central heating problems, this problem, that problem. They are not equipped also. There's a good cross section today, good cross section of people, two, three frivolous people come in. Who just came and sat down, went away. One fellow who came in the end, at a time when we had started our, ah, when we had started our meditation you see, that's why I would request you, some people should be there. As soon as we start meditation, don't allow anybody to come in. And if somebody is going also, you should say that you should not do this. They are told not to disturb, halfway. Be careful otherwise that person might just get the whole thing disturbed, just waiting to say something. So it's better to see that they go out, and then you tell them that you should not have done it. Just now, just now, it's not so hot, isn't it? It's quite cool. Yesterday was very hot at this time? So it has cooled down definitely, isn't it? It has cooled down. You could not sit like this yesterday. There is no air conditioning just now?

Yes you better have the, or tea at the end of it, because you see that's why I was telling Warren that before puja, or before marriages, auspicious thing, we should not have any workshop because you see, these people come with all their problems. So better if you have it, after that, is all right. But married couples should not be there. They should just go away somewhere, those who are recently married, because it's not proper. Who is married? A new person who is married. Anybody like that who wants to marry? You do? You? All right. Where does he sleep? In the ashram? That's good. He's alone? Oh I see. And the wife has gone away. And they are with you? Oh, they are with the ladies. Oh I see. No because he never married. That's why people don't marry these days, you see.

Is life so horrible, that we create more problems. You see there should not be such a binding thing for men. It's the other way round here. Whatever you try with human beings, you see, it doesn't work out. This way or that way. Oh, it's just left side - also there is a lot of left Agnya, left this thing. It's better now. So many people out of them come before also. I felt that way, but they didn't come here. I will arrange it. I think we should have some more ashrams also. So that, you see, this end may be far away than may be another end. That side.

No, you see, you should have children and the mothers. And I mean the children should be staying here, to begin with and the rest can shift. Don't disturb the children, for the time being. But if you have more children, and if they allow you to have some sort of a portable thing put up here accommodation. Then also those children mostly should be staying here would be a better idea - with their parents. Would be a better idea. Yes, yes, but, I think, you see, those who have small children, need not stay. Only those who are educated - twenty children are educated. And how many? Yes all with the little babies, should be out. Only the children who are studying here, their parents should stay here. As far as possible.

For something close by, that so that it is not too much for the children to come to the school. But if you have these portable things and you can have more children? Can you? In this area specially? So we will start another school? Start with a school another place. All right. It's good. We should have really, schools of twenty children here, thirty children there, twenty children there. It's a good idea. And so we will get children from other places. We can.
I think now, they want to start one school in Perth. They want to start a school also in Sydney. Also maybe in Adelaide. School is a very good idea. It's the best for the place like Australia, where the innocence is maintained, isn't it? To get children? More children will be born, here at that level. Better now?

...means I, I bow to the enlightened ones, you see that means enlightenment, secondly  I, I bow to... because Ekadesha catches. All right. The first is [INAUDIBLE] which means enlightenment in beyond ego [INDIAN] it self shows that you have to give up your ego [INDIAN] means surrender. I surrender myself to the enlightened one, to the spirit. Then I surrender myself to collectivity. To Dharma. I surrender myself to Dharma. Three parts. These are the most important three chanting.

Everybody is nicely upside down, with their legs towards God and their heads towards, head towards, hell. Straight forward march. Nobody's sensible. Nobody's sensible there. Some of them are stupid. Some are egoistical. Everything. Nobody's sensible, wise, nobody. Anyone you tell me. Stupid people. And the Sufis. I just don't know how they call themselves Sufis. A little ice would help. Put it in the fridge. A little ice, little ice I don't mind. I think all right. I'll have some food and then sleep. I think the heat and the...
