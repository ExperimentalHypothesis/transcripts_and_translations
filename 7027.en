Sahastrara Puja, 1st Puja in South America. Bogota (Colombia), 20 July 1988.

It is such a great pleasure to be here in Colombia which was My great desire long time back, that somehow if I could come later to this country, I may be able to start Sahaja Yoga here because I did feel at that time that there are lots of seekers and very good people in Colombia. They are the seekers of truth and want to rise higher in their awareness and as it was desired by Me, it has worked out. I am very happy to be here among you people. And we have people from also other countries of South America which is a very great thing. It started working out in European countries, which were developed countries we can say, but I always had a very earnest desire to come to the other side, that is the under-developed countries where there is culture. It has to spread to all the countries; no country should say that "it did not come to us, that we did not know the truth, that we missed the point".

As you people are the first founders and the foundation stones of Sahaja Yoga you have to be very careful. As I have said many a-times, the knowledge that we have from science and other things is the knowledge of the tree but Sahaja Yoga is the knowledge of the roots. So we have to become deeper personalities, we have to see our own depths and our own glories and our own beauties, and to enjoy them. All that beauty you can have plus you can see that the human beings are part and parcel of one personality but we cannot do it just by lecturing or by giving sermons, but we have to prove it to them by their ascent, that is by giving them Self-realization, by the actualization of the experience. In every way we have to tell them that the truth cannot found out by paying money or by making efforts or by sufferings. The truth resides within us and we have to just reconcile to the idea that so far we have not found it.

Now the way you will handle them is very important, because they come to My program, get realization, but when they come back then you have to handle them very carefully and delicately. Also you must understand what is the pulse of your country, what is the speciality of your country, pulse of the country, what is the pulse. Now for example I find people here are very sweet, very innocent, very traditional so you have to approach them in that manner. But supposing they are from the intellectual sort of areas or from over-industrialized areas, then you have to approach them in that way. So first of all you must keep your vibrations clear, also you must know what you should do as to become experts in vibrations. You should be able to say whether somebody is catching this or that or what you are catching but, you should not in any way tell them what others are catching, let them find out themselves. As they will start growing in their own sensitivity, they themselves can find out what's wrong with them. They themselves will tell you, what is the finger they are burning, where are they getting the heat, they themselves will tell you. Then you have to tell them that this is the centre you are catching, this is the problem, if they ask you. This is how you should move with them, but in any case if there is any problem, anything, you can write to Me directly, I am always available for anything that you want to know.

I hope today there will be many people who will be coming to the program, but follow-on has to be attended properly by all of you and you should be able to gently handle them, and as you know that we do not have anything like registration of names, or anything, but better is to talk to them, each one of them, ask their names, what are they doing, where they live, it's much better. And if they want they can leave their addresses with you. For your pujas and all that, you have to see them, if they are deep enough, then you can call them for pujas, also puja can be quite a shock to them because they have never known all these things before. There are so many ways by which you can convince them that this is the truth. In any case if you have any questions you should ask Me later on, so I can tell what is to be the problem. So now let us now have the puja, and after that I think most of the questions will be solved for us, practically.

Alright. So let us have the, for washing, little warm water will be a good idea.
