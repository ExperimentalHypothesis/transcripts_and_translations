Sahastrara Puja, 1st Puja in South America. Bogota (Colombia), 20 July 1988.

 It is a such a great pleasure to be here in Colombia, which was my great desire, long time back that somehow if I could come later to this country, I may be able to start Sahaja Yoga here. Because I did feel at that time there are lots of seekers and very good people in Colombia. They are the Seekers of Truth and want to rise higher in their awareness. And as it was desired by me, it has worked out. I am very happy to be here among you people, and we have people from also other countries of South America which is a very great thing. We started working out in European countries, which were developed countries we can say, but I always had a very earnest desire to come to the other side, that is, underdeveloped countries, where there is culture. It has to spread to all the countries; no country should say that it didn't come to us, that we didn't know the Truth, that we missed the point. As you people are first founders and the foundation stones of Sahaja Yoga so you have to be very careful, As I have said many times that the Knowledge that we have from Science and other things is the Knowledge of the Tree, but Sahaja Yoga is the Knowledge of the Roots. So, we have to become a deeper personality. We must see our own depths, and our glories and all own beauties, and to enjoy it. All the beauty we can have, plus, you can see that human beings are part and parcel of one personality. But we cannot do it just lecturing or by giving sermons. But we have to prove to them by their ascent, that is, by giving them Self-Realization, by the actualization of the experience. In every way, we have to tell them that the Truth cannot be found out by paying money or making efforts or by sufferings. The Truth resides within us and we have to just reconcile to the idea that so far, we have not found it. Now the way you will handle them is very important because they come to my program, get Realization, but when they come back then you have to handle them very carefully and delicately. Also, you must understand what is the pulse of your country, which is the speciality of your country. Now, for example, I find people here are very sweet, very innocent very traditional, so you have to approach them in that manner. But supposing they are from the intellectual sort of areas or from over-industrialized areas then you have to approach them in that way. So, first of all, you must keep your Vibrations clear. Also, you must know what you should do as to become experts in Vibrations. You should be able to say, whether somebody is catching, this or that, or what you are catching. But, you should not in any way tell them what others are catching, let them find out themselves. As they will start growing in their own sensitivity, they themselves can find out what's wrong with them. They themselves will tell you what is the finger that is burning, where they are getting the heat, themselves they will tell you, then you have to tell them that is the Centre that you are catching, this is the problem if they ask you that is the way to move with them. But if any case there is any problem, anything you can write to me directly; I am always available to anything that you want to know. I hope today there will be many people who will be coming to the program. But follow -on has to be attended properly by all of you, and you must be able to gently handle them and as you know that we don't have anything like registration of names or anything, but better is to talk to them- each one of them, ask their names, what are they doing, where they live, is much better. And if they want, they can leave their addresses with you. For your Pujas and all that you have to see them if they're deep enough, you can call them for Puja, also Puja can be quite of a shock to them. Because they have never known all these things before. They are so many ways by which you can convince them that this is the Truth. If any case if you have any questions you should ask me later on, so I can tell you what is to be a problem. So now lets us have the Puja and after that, I think most of the questions will be solved automatically (smilingly) (All right let us have the for washing little warm water will be a good idea.

Copper is very auspicious mettle and you get a lot of copper here. You both can come for washing, You and the little girl. Come along, three of you come, come to this side, you be on this side, you come to this side, you come to the centre. Come to the centre. Push back your sleeves. Now.
