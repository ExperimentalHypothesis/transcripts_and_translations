Interview With Shri Mataji, Piacenza, Italy 24-10-1987

[Interview after the First Public Program in Piacenza, Italy]

Interviewer: Is it dangerous for the children or for the people to awake the kundalini?

Shri Mataji: Not at all. Children do it much better, they are the best. But they have to be realized souls [the persons who awaken the kundalini]. There are many children who are born realized nowadays.

Interviewer: Sixty percent of the people in the program got their realisation. How much do you think they were influenced?

Shri Mataji: I think they all have got the awakening of the kundalini but now they have to respect their Self-realisation. And they have to attend the centers, find out about it and then master it.

Interviewer: You feel you are the incarnation of God as a woman. Can you tell us more about this?

Shri Mataji: It is dangerous for anyone to say that he is an incarnation except for the fake people. But the real people, it's very dangerous because when people know they are incarnations they attack them. And they have killed so many real incarnations before. So I am rather wise and tactful, I don't want to say anything about myself. You better find out yourself, after realisation you will know what I am.

Interviewer: What is Mahatma Gandhi's heritage for you?

Shri Mataji: Mahatma Gandhi, when he came on this Earth, he had a big problem because we were slaves of the British and at that time we had to fight for our freedom. That was our big problem. And as you have to cross, supposing there is a river and you have to cross it then that's the main problem. But once you become independent, when you become free, then you start thinking of your spirituality. And he was a very spiritual man himself. I was a little child when he was there but he consulted me on many things, spiritual especially. He used to call me as "Nepali" because I had high cheekbones.

Interviewer: As a Great Mother is there something that we donâ€™t know and you know that you want to tell us? Some advice to us.

Shri Mataji: The advice is that now we have to find out our absolute being. Because we are living in a relative world and that's why there is a problem: nobody knows what is right, what is wrong. But the absolute is within us, all the knowledge is within us, and that is what we should find and establish.

Interviewer: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: Thank you.
