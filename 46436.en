Shri Mataji: Ah, the great Sahaja Yogis are sitting down, he? [Laughter]
Alexandre: We are Brahmins.
Shri Mataji: Have you got the Deepak?
Dr Rustom: Deepak, lamp.
Shri Mataji: Light, light.
Alexandre: Matches?
Sahaja Yogi: Lamp. [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Gavin, you have the shawl with you?
Come along.
Alexandre: [Inaudible] We came back to India!

Sahaja Yogi: Mother?
Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, what about everybody? [Unsure]
Shri Mataji: Let them, if they want to come.

Shri Mataji: Now spread out [inaudible].
Gregoire: [Explains in French what they will do]
Shri Mataji: Please.
Can you spread something more for people?
[Shri Mataji is making a bandhan]

Shri Mataji: Please move from the thing. Because, you see, normally, people want to walk. A little bit so all can have and put it and it starts.

You see, I would say that John, you can make these people come forward.
Please come forward.
Where is Nathalie?
You also come along.
People who are from France and Algeria should be seated. And also, from Lille.
Where is the Ghanta?
Dr Rustom: The bell.
Gregoire: Where is the bell?
Gavin: Just coming.

Shri Mataji: [To the Algerian lady] Come forward.
Keep it there with Gregoire. You see, keep it with him.
With Nathalie. All right? You people [inaudible] of that.
[A child gives the bell to Shri Mataji] Oh! Thank you very much, thank you.

Shri Mataji: [To Gregoire] Keep the light down.
They can do it.
Now somebody must look after the wood. And I think, Benoît, you look after that.
Alexandre: The ghee.
Shri Mataji: And you look after this, you see? All of you look after this.

Before doing anything else, we have to sanctify all the things that you are going to use. Means, we have to get them vibrated.

So, Gavin, let’s do it. [Inaudible]

[Gregoire puts a point of Kumkum on the bell, then on the coconut and its pot, the ‘kumbha’.]
Shri Mataji: This [kumbha] represents the Kundalini. And the top one [coconut] represents the Mooladhara. The coconut represents the Omkara.
[Shri Mataji draws a swastika on the conch]

Sahaja Yogis: Om twame wa sakshat, Shri Agni sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti sakshat, Shri Bhagwati sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, namoh, namaha. (X 3)
Dr Rustom: First, we’ll begin by the seven names of Lord Agni.
Om Shri [Inaudible]
Sahaja Yogis: Swaha, swaha.
Dr Rustom: Now we begin with Lord Vishnu’s names.
