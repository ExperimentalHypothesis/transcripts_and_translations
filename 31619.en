Shri Mataji: Give her a chair.

Give her a chair otherwise she won't be able to play harmonium.

Ah, [Hindi]

Can you keep it up there? Ah. On that.

[Hindi]

You can move that.

Come on. Have a sit there.

Sahaja Yogi: We would like to present you a bhajan [unsure] by Sant Eknath. It's a song that

[inaudible]

to teach people what will happen to them if they don't behave in a [inaudible].

In this particular song, Sant Eknath is talking about what happens to people if they're not if they trick people badly. If they are rude to them if they cheat them. Sant Eknath gives example in particular of Duryodhana who took Draupadi and humiliated her in his court and who was eventually his brother, the brother of Duryodhana drag Draupadi into the court to be humiliated. And was eventually punished by Bhishma, punished by Bhishma in a dual.

In the same way, Ravana who kidnapped Shri Sita was duly punished by Shri Rama. And so on in many cases.

In reality, there are only four people that Sant Eknath mentions who are free from any kind of problem in his regard. For example, Bhishma and Hanumana who are two of these examples.

Sant Eknath concludes the song advising us to be sweet with each other and not to abuse each other. Otherwise, if - cause if we do, then our fate is a very ugly one.

Babamama: Give me a microphone on tablas.

Shri Mataji: When standing, they will wait.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So, all of you can sit there like this only.

Patrick!

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

[Music starts.]

Sahaja Yogi: We have another song for you. This time it's a village's song, a folk's song from Uttar Pradesh. The context of the song is a group of villagers on a way to a festival at Prayag in the month of Magha which is January or February. And Prayag is a place where the two holy rivers of India, Ganga and Yamuna, meet. So, in the first verse, the villagers are singing the praises of Prayag where the rivers meet, and for this reason, it's a holy place, a place of pilgrimage.

In the second verse, they explain how Ganga comes from Haridwar, which is also a place of pilgrimage, because Ganga has come down from the heaven in that place. So it has come from Haridwar, which is a popular place of pilgrimage, to Prayag which is also a place of pilgrimage.

Lady [on harmonium]: Come here, on the same line. You go a little bit that side.

Lady [on harmonium]: Ok, very good.

Shri Mataji: Ah! This reminded me of my own marriage when I went to my husband's house. They all used to sing like this only there. So, it's wonderful, the way they have sung it, absolutely with complete pronunciation, everything, it's wonderful. I was just enjoying it. Thank you very much. And I hope you all have enjoyed too.

[Applause]

Lady [on harmonium]: The group of students who are sitting in front of you, on the stage, have been learning have been learning classical music at Garlati house near Milano, I hope you - all of you know Garlati house. And they covered about seven ragas. Among these ragas, they learnt Marva raga which is the favorite raga of Shri Mataji. And they will sing what we call the chutta khayal [composition] in ektaal [12 beats]. First, they will sing the aroha [ascending scale] and pakad [melodic theme] of raga Marva and then sargam [singing notes].

Shri Mataji: Aroha is ascend

Lady [on harmonium]: Aroha is, are the ascending notes of the raga. And Avaroha are the descending notes of the raga. And pakad are the group of notes typical of that raga, so that the raga can be recognized when those notes are sung. And they are singing the chutta khayal in ektaal. And before singing the chutta khayal, they will sing sargam. Sargam, they will sing also in double rhythm. And chutta khayal, they will sing with alap and taans [first and second part of the raga].

I hope all of you will like it and Shri Mataji will also like what they sing in the present.

[Music starts.]

[Applause]

Lady [on harmonium]: Is a prayer composed by Guru Dev Rabindranath Tagore in raga Bhairavi. "Antara Mama Bikoshito Karo, antara tara hey." The devotee is praying to the God that: "Let my inner being be enlightened." "Nirmala karo, ujjwala karo, sundara karo hey."

Nirmala, you know: Shri Mataji's name is Nirmala, pure. Absolutely pure.

"Mangalo karo" make it holy and make it beautiful. So, this prayer is being sung by the students who were studying semi-classical in raga Bhairavi and this will be the last song.

[Music starts.]

[Applause]

Babamama: In a bus and we had a lot of discomfort in the sense that we were not feeling free. But when we came into this wonderful land of Italy, we were feeling very, very free and we were also feeling very hungry. Maybe, it has something to do with the Nabhi, I'm sure.

But then, in order to keep my Sangeet Sarita members happy, I was trying to sing a raga which is known as Chandrakauns. It's a very, very dynamic raga. And close to that raga is another raga known as Malkauns. And there is a difference of only one note in these two ragas. And, as I was singing I was talking to Guruji and I was saying that if we add this note of one raga into another, I think we will create a beautiful raga.

And he immediately got up and he started singing with that additional note and a new raga was born. Just, just in the bus, a new raga was born. And then, we had to give a name and Guruji gave a very, very dynamic very sahaj name: he called it "Chaitanya ranjani" which will entertain your Chaitanya.

This is a raga which is going to be played for the first time. Even in India, my sister will bear me out that this has not been played before, anywhere. So, you can imagine what's a headache is done to this poor Babamama who knew very little about music. He's gone so dynamic that he is creating ragas!

[Laughter]
