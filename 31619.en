Shri Mataji: Give her a chair.

Give her a chair otherwise she won't be able to play harmonium.

Ah, [Hindi]

Can you keep it up there? Ah. On that.

[Hindi]

You can move that.

Come on. Have a sit there.

Sahaja Yogi: We would like to present you with a Bharood [Marathi religious song] by Sant Eknath. It's a song that, in a style that is designed to teach people what will happen to them if they don't behave in a, in the correct way.

In this particular song, Sant Eknath is talking about what happens to people if they're not if they trick people badly. If they are rude to them if they cheat them. Sant Eknath gives example in particular of Duryodhana who took Draupadi and humiliated her in his court and it was eventually his brother, the brother of Duryodhana drag Draupadi into the court to be humiliated. And was eventually punished by Bhishma, punished by Bhishma in a dual. 

In the same way, Ravana who kidnapped Shri Sita was duly punished by Shri Rama. And so on in many cases.

In reality, there are only four people that Sant Eknath mentions who are free from any kind of problem in his regard. For example, Bhishma and Hanumana, those two are examples.

Sant Eknath concludes the song advising us to be sweet with each other and not to abuse each other. Otherwise- cause if we do, then our fate is a very ugly one.

Babamama: Give me a microphone for tablas.

Shri Mataji: When standing, they will wait.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So, all of you can sit there like this only.

Patrick!

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

[Music starts.]

Sahaja Yogi: We have another song for you. This time it's a village's song, a folk's song from Uttar Pradesh. The context of the song is a group of villagers on a way to a festival at Prayag in the month of Magha which is January or February. And Prayag is a place where the two holy rivers of India, Ganga and Yamuna, meet. So, in the first verse, the villagers are singing the praises of Prayag where the rivers meet, and for this reason, it's a holy place, a place of pilgrimage.

In the second verse, they explain how Ganga comes from Haridwar, which is also a place of pilgrimage, because Ganga has come down from the heaven in that place. So it has come from Haridwar, which is a popular place of pilgrimage, to Prayag which is also a place of pilgrimage.

[Music starts.]

Lady [on harmonium]: Come here, on the same line. You go a little bit that side.

Lady [on harmonium]: Ok, very good.

Shri Mataji: Ah! This reminded me of my own marriage when I went to my husband's house. They all used to sing like this only there. So, it's wonderful, the way they have sung it, absolutely with complete pronunciation, everything, it's wonderful. I was just enjoying it. Thank you very much. And I hope you all have enjoyed too.

[Applause]

Lady [on harmonium]: The group of students who are sitting in front of you, on the stage, have been learning classical music at Garlati house near Milano, I hope you - all of you know Garlati house. And they covered about seven ragas. Among these ragas, they learnt Marva raga which is the favourite raga of Shri Mataji. And they will sing what we call the chutta khayal [composition] in ektaal [12 beats]. First, they will sing the aroha [ascending scale] and pakad [melodic theme] of raga Marva and then sargam [singing notes].

Shri Mataji: Aroha is ascend

Lady [on harmonium]: Aroha is, are the ascending notes of the raga. And Avaroha are the descending notes of the raga. And pakad are the group of notes typical of that raga, so that the raga can be recognized when those notes are sung. And they are singing the chutta khayal in ektaal. And before singing the chutta khayal, they will sing sargam. Sargam, they will sing also in double rhythm. And chutta khayal, they will sing with alap and taans [first and second part of the raga].

I hope all of you will like it and Shri Mataji will also like what they sing in the present.

[Music starts.]

[Applause]

[Cut in the video]

Lady [on harmonium]: Is a prayer composed by Guru Dev Rabindranath Tagore in raga Bhairavi. "Antara Mama Bikoshito Karo, antara tara hey." The devotee is praying to the God that: "Let my inner being be enlightened." "Nirmala karo, ujjwala karo, sundara karo hey."

Nirmala, you know: Shri Mataji's name is Nirmala, pure. Absolutely pure.

"Mangalo karo" make it holy and make it beautiful. So, this prayer is being sung by the students who were studying semi-classical in raga Bhairavi and this will be the last song.

[Music starts.]

[Applause]

Babamama: In a bus and we had a lot of discomfort in the sense that we were not feeling free. But when we came into this wonderful land of Italy, we were feeling very, very free and we were also feeling very hungry. Maybe, it has something to do with the Nabhi, I'm sure.

But then, in order to keep my Sangeet Sarita members happy, I was trying to sing a raga which is known as Chandrakauns. It's a very, very dynamic raga. And close to that raga is another raga known as Malkauns. And there is a difference of only one note in these two ragas. And, as I was singing I was talking to Guruji and I was saying that if we add this note of one raga into another, I think we will create a beautiful raga.

And he immediately got up and he started singing with that additional note and a new raga was born. Just, just in the bus, a new raga was born. And then, we had to give a name and Guruji gave a very, very dynamic very sahaj name: he called it "Chaitanya ranjani" which will entertain your Chaitanya.

This is a raga which is going to be played for the first time. Even in India, my sister will bear me out that this has not been played before, anywhere. So, you can imagine what's a headache is done to this poor Babamama who knew very little about music. He's gone so dynamic that he is creating ragas!

[Laughter]

[Applause]

Babamama: This will be played to you by one and only Guruji on the violin and our young artist Naseer khan.

Guido, could you please take down completely... as it is obstructing the view. It has to be removed completely.

I was discussing this raga with other sister; where is she? I can't see. She must be sitting on side. So, she was saying us to: "How could you create this raga?" And she herself replied: "It is because of your concentration in music." "That, that is because you put your heart and soul in something and you will achieve." So, when you have to have creativity, your attention is the most important equipment. So, you put your attention on something and you are bound to create if your attention is fully on that subject.

Out of the twelve brothers and sisters that we are, my dear sister is a subtle artist and was blessed with this voice and the gift of music and we used to have music every day in the house. I was a very playful boy, but in between, I used to go and listen to this music. And that has been registered with me and it is coming so helpful now so that we can transfer this culture of India through this music to all the Sahaja Yogis. It's a tremendous feeling.

Now, I will first tell you as to what the two ragas are and then I will tell you how they have been blended. So you will be able to appreciate the difference.

First, a very brief introduction of the members of the Nirmal Sangeet Sarita who are on the stage: Sandesh Popatkar on the tabla.

Then our Guruji, mister Prabhakarji [Dhakde] on the violon.

And, two years ago this young artist Nasser Khan was here, he was then the baby of the team. He has lost that status of being a baby because he's become, he is going to become a father very shortly. And- but his sitar has improved immensely over the two years.

And now I will ask Prabhakarji to first play the ragas as they are. The two ragas. Now, first, he will play the Chandrakauns. One minute, the tuning.

Now, this is Chandrakauns he is playing.

Now, this is the original raga, Chandrakauns.
