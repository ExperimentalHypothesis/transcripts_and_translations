Shri Krishna puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 20 August 2000.

Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna within us. 

As you know you all have been seeking before coming to Sahaj Yoga. You went to different places, read lots of books and also some of you were lost. And, in that seeking, perhaps you did not know what you were seeking. What you were seeking was to know yourself. In all religions it is said ‘know thyself’: is a common thing all of them have said. This is one point which is absolutely there, in every religion, ‘know thyself’, because without knowing yourself, you will not know God, you will not know spirituality.

So the first step was to know yourself. And [for] that one, people did all kinds of tricks with you, they taught you in different ways and tried to actually loot you and cheat you. All those things [that] have happened, is finished. 

So then you come to Sahaj Yoga and you get your Self-realisation. But what is the purpose of Self-realisation? Is to know God, or the Goddess, that is the purpose of Self-realisation. 

But after getting Self-realisation what should happen to you? Many of you have lost interest in nonsensical things like drugs and all those things. You have lost interest also in reading useless books. You have lost interest in other habits, like drinking and all that. But that’s not enough, that’s not enough. That would happen in any way. What has to happen by knowing God is that, why does God want you to know him? Because He wants to see His reflection in you. He wants to see His reflection that’s why He has created you and He wants to see His reflection in you. Same with the Goddess: She has given you Self-realisation because She wants to see Her reflection in you. So you have to prepare yourself for that reflection, which is so much purer, beautiful, loving, compassionate and, above all, full of wisdom. 

So this is the point, one has to reach: where you understand you have to have wisdom. If you are lacking in wisdom then you are not a Self-realised person.

At the level of Shri Krishna, you see [that] He wants you to become part and parcel of the Virata, or the Viratangana also wants the same thing: that you should become part and parcel of the Virata. Not because you are realised-souls now, so you go about thinking [that] you are perfectly alright [and] you don’t have to do anything about it. What do you do beyond this is the point, that after Self-realisation you have to see the reflection that should be within you from the lives of these people like Shri Krishna.

Shri Krishna was first born in a very difficult situation as you know and He was carried from there to Gokul, where He was brought up by Yashoda. 

Now, there He started His playfulness. So you have to be playful in life: you have to create fun and joy. He didn’t say that you sit down like an old sage, somewhere in the Himalayas but you mix up with children, you talk to them, you play with them, have fun. 

At the same time He was destroying all the negative forces which acted upon Him. In His playfulness only He’s done it, as a child only He has done it. How matured He was as a child you can see, that he killed Putana and there are two horrible Rakshas also: He killed them. 

At the same time He was playing with the Gopis and teasing them, troubling them, making fun of them. Why? Because He wanted them to be playful. And all kinds of celebrations He arranged. Once a big rain came and He lifted the complete big mountain on his fingertips. These people should have understood that it’s not possible, it’s a miracle. But He was just standing there with one finger at the mountain. In a very simple unassuming manner He was doing all that, to protect all the boys who were playing with him. 

Then He went and killed Kalia, the one who was a big snake, in the water. In the water this horrible fellow was creating venom, and by which many people were killed. It took Him no time and He jumped inside that horrible water of Yamuna from where He rescued, in a way, all the people, by killing or hitting or you can say that winning over this Kalia.

But the wives of the big serpant asked Him that, “Please forgive him!” and He forgave. All these things show that a child of six, seven years doing all these great things without feeling what He was doing, without even thinking about it. But He achieved it because He was aware that He was Shri Krishna.

So first thing you have to be aware that you are self-realised people. You are not ordinary people to behave in an ordinary way. You are special people, made specially to reflect the qualities of God Almighty. It’s not expected that you go and kill Kalia. But the situation is such, today, that you are all the time protected. You are all the time protected: no one can harm you, no one can kill you and you are being looked after because you are Sahaj Yogis.

Now what should be the attitude of a Sahaj Yogi towards taking decisions, one should understand. 

It should be a spontaneous decision. You don’t have to tally it with this, go there and find out: immediately, spontaneously, like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river. So in the same way you should have a very spontaneous decision for anything. Now you want to buy, say a carpet: alright, you go in the shop and you immediately should know which is the one. 

In every walk of life you should have a very spontaneous decision, instant decision. But what I find, the style is very different: they’ll go from shop to shop, then make a list of it, then make all the measurements, then go home and say that, “We’ll decide it tomorrow.” That’s not the way a Sahaj Yogi behaves. A Sahaj Yogi has to decide everything absolutely spontaneously, at that moment. You should be like this: now somebody is getting drowned; so the first impulse should be that you have to save, and how do you save? You jump in the water. Because you are protected, nothing can happen to you. So you just jump in the water and you’d save the person. Minimum of minimum this should be your attitude, this should be your temperament, that you take a very spontaneous decision. 

All this thinking and all kinds of decision making and having a big conference for decisions and all that [are] not needed. In day-to-day life also you have to be like that. Also in every political life, economic life or any other life you have to lead, you have to be very spontaneous.

How do you become spontaneous? What quality you have got? What is the weapon you have got to know what decision to take? Do you know you have got vibrations? You have the feel of the vibrations and you know what vibrations are. You know what vibrations tell you and convey and communicate to you. They speak to you. So through your vibrations you should know in a second what should you do.

For example now somebody told me that, “Mother when I come to Cabella I felt tremendous vibrations!” It’s a fact. But how many of you feel that way? Because your sensitivity is not yet developed. You have to be sensitive about your vibrations. You should know, looking at anyone, sitting next to anyone, even shaking hands with anyone, you should know what sort of vibrations that person has. This kind of sensitivity if you develop, then you will definitely take a very spontaneous decision. 

You know I am very good at it. I bought this Cabella in five minutes, really five minutes. When I came here, they said you cannot go up because you have a big car. So the mayor said, “Alright come along. I’ll take you in my car.” So I went with him on that car and I saw it. It was all dilapidated, no doubt. It was all absolutely in a shambles alright, and looked like a ghostly place, no doubt. And everybody who was with me they said, “Ahh,  what a place Mother! You can’t buy that!” So I told the mayor “I am buying it!” “When?” “Today, now!” He was amazed! I said, “You tell me how do I buy it?” He said, “Very easy in this Italy: you have to buy, like this, that you to pay one third of the price.” “Alright,” “And then you can occupy. If you find something wrong with the place you can give it up, but then you will not get back your money. But if the other fellow who is selling you says no, then he has to pay double.” I said, “Very good bargain! I am buying. I have told you I am buying. I’ll buy.” And everybody was surprised what Mother was doing? 

So what decided was the vibrations. The vibrations of the place just decided. I said, “I’m buying!” That way they took me to seven castles I think! I said no. Outside only I could say no. And they were surprised, I didn’t even go inside. I said, “Ask them what was here.” They said, “Nunnery.” I said, “See?”

Now you should develop that kind of a spontaneous decision, then you will be amazed how in such a short time you can really achieve such a great things! But that doesn’t mean that you all should do that way. First you should have that sensitivity of vibrations. If you have that sensitivity of vibrations, then I would say you are now matured in Sahaj Yoga. 

So the maturity has to be brought in. You cannot just say, “Now it’s alright, I have got Self-realisation. I can do this!” First you tally your sense of sensitivity. So now, how do you know? For example, you take a spontaneous decision and you find that you have got nothing, it’s all nonsense - it’s possible. But you can see for yourself that your decisions, if they are spontaneous, if they fail, if they are wrong, if there are some mistakes or that will make you suffer - whether economically, politically, in every way - then your whole values system will be judged very well: how far you have gone into Sahaj Yoga, how far you have achieved your Self-realisation, and where are you.

This is what is the way to test yourself. You should not be afraid of failures and not get enamoured by success, because you are Self-realised souls. Of course, if you are sensitive, immediately you will know what it is. Of course, I won’t say that you should have the same as I have, but you should try to.

Now I have seen some people who will praise some man, “Oh Mother he is so good, you must meet him. He’s such a nice person, and he’s of such a help. And this will happen and that will happen.” I said, “Alright, you show me a photograph.” I said, “I am sorry I don’t want to meet him!” They cannot understand. “Such a great man! He’ll be a minister tomorrow!” “I don’t want to meet him.” And you find, just next day, a big report about him in the newspaper that he’s a very bad man.

So you must tally your experience and your understanding of what you have decided spontaneously. But still, I would say, keep to spontaneous decisions: don’t think about it; how it should work out, what should we do.

It has a very farfetched influence on your mind, also, that you see, that you know what is right and what is wrong. I don’t know how many of you have seen the house I have built.

The another side of Shri Krishna was that He was extremely creative. In His childhood He did all these things, these pranks, and when He became a grown-up person He became the king of Dwarika, of that area. And He used to dress up like a king only. After all He was a king. When He was a child He used to wear a small little piece of feather from the peacock. But when He became the king, He was wearing all the things and He used to sit on a throne and talk to people in that manner. All that greatness was there, and He was extremely creative. He built a beautiful, very, very beautiful castle, or you can say a palace, in Dwarika out of gold. Can you believe it? Shri Krishna did it and it was all then covered with water.

Now the intellectuals in India — all trained by western people, I think — said that, “It’s not possible. There’s nothing in the water and he never built his palace there. It’s all a story. Just like a myth.” But some people believed in it and they dug up. They went down and they found there was a very big palace, there was gold, little bit left, but not all of it was there. And they were amazed [that] such a huge big palace He had made. Under the water it had gone but it was there. 

Like this, all these incarnations who came were extremely creative. If you are not creative what’s the use of Self-realisation? Now, what is the greatest creative thing you can do very easily is to make others Sahaj Yogis. That is the easiest and most joy-giving thing: is to make others Sahaj Yogis and give them the blessings of the Divine, which they have been seeking for the ages. 

By giving them you don’t know what a solace, what a blessing you give them. So now when you have got your Self-realisation: you got it very easily, I must say. They all say that it is an instant Nirvana. Sahaj Yoga is Instant Nirvana, it’s true. But whatever you get so easily and instantly, you don’t understand the value of that. They always say for India that they got the freedom so easily — they didn’t get it that easily — that’s why they do not value it. But it’s true: if you get anything free, firstly, and without any special effort then you don’t value it, you don’t understand. You think it is the matter of right.

But do you know how much people have suffered for getting Self-realisation? They used to go on the Himalayas, stand on one leg, sometimes on their heads for months together. And they didn’t get Realisation.

I have heard of some people who lived in a room for twenty-eight years to get Self-realisation. And why they lived like that [is] because they thought that by keeping away from other people, other bad atmosphere, everything, they might get Realisation. [But] they never got it.

So one must understand: though you have got it very easily, it’s something so precious, so great. It’s not very easy to get Self-realisation. 

You read about the people who are Self-realised. Perhaps they didn’t even know how they got it. They did not know even about the Kundalini, but they got it; through their Guru maybe, maybe their efforts. Buddha, how much he had to suffer till he got his Realisation! Think of Him, how he got His Realisation! I mean you shudder to see His life: ultimately dies of hunger and poverty. 

But nothing happened to you. You have got it without any difficulties, in a very sweet manner, all of you. Nothing, you don’t have to pay, you don’t have to do anything about it. But that doesn’t mean you should not value it. Like a seed which is put in the Mother Earth spontaneously sprouts and gives a life to the plumule which grows, can grow, into a shrub and then into a tree. But you have to put water and you have to have the care of a gardener or someone. In your case you are the one who has to do all that.

First of all you have to put the nourishment of compassion and love. Have you got that compassion and love? Do you love people? Like somebody told me today, I was shocked  “I don’t like children!” I said, “You don’t like children?” ”No, I like other children, not mine.” Just imagine! How can you be doing that? How can you say such a thing? You don’t like your own children. Anything! First of all, for all of you I would say that you should never say, “I like” or “I don’t like”: these are anti-mantras. “I like this” is very common. Who are you? “I don’t like this carpet!” “I don’t like that silver thing!” Who are you? Can you make one like that? To take a decision of that kind it also shows [that] they think it is very spontaneous. It’s not. It has come from your conditioning that you think, “I have a right to say, ‘I don’t like,’ ‘I don’t want.’” But who are you? If you are the Spirit you will never use these words because it might hurt somebody. You will never say something that will hurt others. You will never do anything that will be dangerous for others. But always, you will say something that would be extremely loving and compassionate and peace giving. 

You will emit joy for others. There is the power of Spirit that it gives joy to others. If you are a glum person, grumpy person then you are not self-realised. You should be able to give joy and love and compassion to others. And it should happen absolutely spontaneously.

There’s a story about a saint in India, in Maharashtra: so they all used to take water in a container, called as ‘kavara’ and would take it all the way to Gujarat to a temple of Shri Krishna. That was regarded as a great surrendering to Shri Krishna. So that saint also carried the water in that container, this kavara. All the way he carried it from his village in Maharashtra and when he reached the temple, at the foot of that temple, he saw a donkey very thirsty, dying of thirst. So he gave that water to that donkey. Everybody said, “Imagine, you have brought this water for miles together, for days together to be put on the deity here and now you have given it to this donkey?” He said, “You don’t know God has come all the way down here to take the water.” See the attitude that he took. 

So for a self-realised person the compassion should be like that: of very generous nature. If you are not generous, if you are miserly, always worried about your money and saving of it, then firstly you are not a matured Sahaj Yogi, you are not. Apart from that, this kind of money will never give you any happiness. 

Miserliness is against Spirit. Spirit is extremely generous, extremely generous. It never tries to save something or cheat people or steal something: is out of question. Because there is no greed left in him, there is no greed at all. And that is why such a person, who is a realised-soul, cannot be greedy, has to be extremely generous. 

I have seen many people like that who have been extremely generous and who have been very understanding about the problems of others. While a Sahaj Yogi [who] will have his own problems is not a Sahaj Yogi at all. He is there to solve the problems of others and not to solve his own problems and go about talking about, “This is the problem I have.” Now this is the new word that has developed in modern times. They have never used to use  the word ‘problem’ before, I tell you. Only for geometry we used this word ‘problem'. But now it has started. They say, “There is no problem”. They are all in a problem. Actually they are problems I think.

So what you have to do is to understand that you should not give your problems to others. You should not ask for anything. “Please do this for me.” “Please do that for me.” 

It’s very surprising that people try to take advantage of others. 

Now some people like to visit some countries, so they will ask me, “Please call me. I would like to come to your country.” And a generous Sahaj Yogi will say, “All right, come along!” Now who is failing here is a person who asks for it. You shouldn’t ask for anything whatsoever, because you are complete. Not only that you are satisfied but you are complete! What can anybody give you? All desires just disappear when you are in complete shape. 

Like today, when I was coming I saw lots of stars had come out. I said, “As soon as the moon will come, they’ll all disappear.” In the same way, when you are complete, you do not expect anybody to do anything for you. On the contrary you want to find out what you can do for others. You become the others in a way that whatever is the problem of others you take upon your head, you jump into it.

It’s a very, very interesting growth that should come in you. It should happen to all of you because you have got your Self-realisation. You develop a kind of a personality which only lives for others, not for oneself. 

You will be amazed — you can live anywhere, you can sleep anywhere. You can have food. You need not have food. Whatever type of food, you get, it’s all right. Because you are so satisfied. On the contrary, you’d like to cook for others, give them food, give whatever you have. [Whatever] possible, you try to do. As long as you can work it out, you do it. But there are people who have only their own problems: they are not Sahaj Yogis. How can the Spirit have problems? How can that happen? So just understand that you are now the Spirit and beyond everything.

So your creativity also goes to other dimensions.

Of course you start giving Realisation to other people. You create art. You know Babamama he was very bad at literature and he didn’t know any language. He was very good for Mathematics, because my mother was a mathematician. But language he did not know. I used to write his essays, he was so bad. But after Realisation he wrote such beautiful poems, unbelievable. Nobody could believe that this Baba could do that. Because he didn’t know any language well. I used to write his essays as I told you. So amazingly, from where he started writing Urdu poetry, Marathi poetry, Hindi poetry? And one of my brothers asked him, “How do you get this Urdu poetry?” He said, “Shri Mataji has, She tells me. Everything She says to say, Mataji tells me.”

So the creativity with in you just flowers and you are amazed at yourself, how this creativity has come in. Now imagine for a person who is a mathematician, becoming suddenly a poet: it’s an impossible situation. And you have these capacities. You all have these capacities that you can become very creative and you have to be creative in every way. I am very creative, I must say. I am all the time working out something, which comes out very well. And also I don’t have that interest, as normally people have, that it should be praised by everyone or it should be sort of very much in the newspapers — no interest. You create for creation, for the sake of creation you create. And you just enjoy that creation. 

And you become very adaptable or you become so congenial with all the things people say, talk, “All right, let them do it!” They will be offensive or they could be also praising you and all that. So, you don’t know, that they are praising you. Even sometimes when you say, “Shri Mataji ki jai,” I also say and then I forget they are talking about me.

Somehow you are above all that and you are there, and you just don’t understand why human beings behave like that, why their behaviour is so funny.

Even when they came to Sahaj Yoga I see they have a great desire to be leaders, or they have great desire to be a great organiser of Sahaj Yoga, so very well known in Sahaj Yoga. They want to have an international fame as a great Sahaj Yogi. But they do not think, “What creativity I have shown? What have I created?” Just, all these things are so common in human beings that they always want others to praise them, to have a very big exposure. Of what? If you are a Spirit everybody knows, what is there to expose? What is there to show off? What is there to come forward? Even if you are at the back there is light, you know there is light. So you have to get out of your darkness because you are the light and you spread light. Instead of [that] if you are in the darkness what light can you spread? 

So your Spirit cannot have [a] problem. It has no fear. But above all it has wisdom, tremendous wisdom. And that is the one sign of you being a very higher personality. 

As I told you, this is evolution and when you are transformed, you are evolved. Of a very different nature you become and you are to stand out. If Sahaj Yogis are like other people then what’s the use of taking to Sahaj Yoga? What was Christ? He was the son of a carpenter, He never got education. But what did He do? He was the Spirit. He reflected God within him. And that’s why He got himself crucified also. But in Sahaj Yoga you do not have to get crucified. There are all not such testing things for you. But your value system is to be checked. 

You must find out how are you working out through introspection. You should ask yourself, “So, well, now, Mr Sahaj Yogi: how are you? Are you indulging into all these things that these people who are not self-realised are doing?” Just try to find out. Because the growth of Sahaj Yoga is shown in your behaviour, in your styles, on your face. There are no wrinkles on a person like this. He has no worry. If you don’t worry then how will you get wrinkles?

Such a person doesn’t get upset with anything. I mean, on the contrary he laughs at things. 

Once in a church, when I was in Switzerland, one lady came to hit me with the Bible and I started laughing I said, “What a thing and a half to be hit by Bible!” And she got such a fright that I was laughing and I was saying that, “Look at the stupidity of this lady coming to hit me with the Bible!" I mean, I can understand stone or anything else but Bible will never hit me! (Laughter) All these things have happened in your presence, and you know about it. 

There are negative forces, they try to harm you: they will harm you badly, they will harm you mentally, they might harm you emotionally. But when you are above this then no one harms you. At least you never feel the harm. You are not bothered about the harm. 

But what have you created? 

Today I had some ladies and some men and all for divorce. After getting married into Sahaj Yoga they want to have divorces, can you imagine? I was shocked! And they had funny ideas that , “My husband is like my brother”. I said,  “Really?” All kinds of stupid ideas coming into their heads means there’s no light of the Spirit in them.

If you have the light of Spirit then your understanding is very different: you don’t worry about yourself, you only worried about others and you try to find out solutions for them. You try to help them. It is very easy for you. What is so easy for the light to burn? Once it is enlightened it is burning. It’s difficult for it to go out of the light. 

But for human beings I cannot understand, even after Realisation, after growing for years together they are still so stupid that they don’t realise the value of their Self-realisation. 

It is something, the Spirit, you cannot kill it, it cannot blow off. This light will go off. But the light of the Spirit won’t go off. But what is the oil that keeps it there? Is your compassion, is love, care of others.

I know there are people who are very dominating, maybe troublesome, what else, but care for them. Know that they are not like you, they are not complete, they have problems, so care for them. But instead of that if you start thinking that, “Why should I care for him? How does he care for me?” or something [like that], then you are finished. So this kind of a reflection, or the reaction is not that of a Spirit. A spiritual person’s reactions are very, very different. 

In the life of Shri Krishna you can see that he had a friend who was very poor and he wanted to meet Shri Krishna. And the wife of the friend gave him some rice, rice krispies as you call them (puffed rice) and [said] that, “Take for your friend, you must take something for your friend.” He was little shy, and when he went to Shri Krishna, Shri Krishna was in his palace and people at the door said, “No, you can’t meet Him!” He said, “Alright, you just go and tell Him that Sudama has come.” He was sitting on the throne, discussing something and He said, “Sudama has come?” He rushed out and went to the door and hugged him, hugged him again and again and He said, “Why are you standing here?” He took him and put him on the throne that He was supposed to sit in and he told his wife, “Please come and wash his feet.” And then they brought for him clothes and all that, he had a bath. He made him sleep on his bed. See the love of Shri Krishna. He had very dirty feet, all cracked. He tried to put on that some sort of a medicine by which it would be all right. He tried to do whatever was possible to cure those cracks and he asked him to sleep on his bed. And asked the ladies to fan him so that he doesn’t feel hot. 

See the compassion of Shri Krishna is shown so beautifully. Are we that compassionate? There was no need for Him to do that, it was no drama, nothing, but His heart took a spontaneous decision. When He heard, Sudama is there, He just rushed there. He just felt so happy that, “My old friend has come”. 

Then when he went to Hastinapur, there Duryodhan, the Kaurava’s eldest son, asked Him that, “Why don’t you come and stay in my palace?” He said, “All right I can come but, I will go and have food with Vidur.” Vidur was the son of a maid. He went and had His food with Vidur. Now Vidur, being a poor man, I don’t know what food he must have given Him, while Duryodhan would have given him such sumptuous food. So for such people taste and the level of food and all doesn’t matter: it’s the love. The respect of Vidur, who was a realised-soul; respecting other Sahaj Yogis. If a Sahaj Yogi respects somebody who is a governor — I can’t understand. The Spirit is above everything else — and does not respect a Sahaj Yogi there’s something wrong with him. He should understand that a spiritual person is higher than all these people who have all kinds of these big names behind them. 

And that love is shown in everybody’s life: all the saints, all the incarnations, everyone had that love, which was above everything else, without expecting anything; not doing it just to expect something from them. It is a kind of a personality, which really reflects God’s love. That reflection should come from you. 

You are Sahaj Yogis, that doesn’t mean that you are higher than others but you are different: you are above them. You have no superiority, that’s why you are different. You are so humble, that’s why you are different. You are so joyous, you are so peaceful that’s why you are humble.

There are so many things I can tell you from the life of Shri Krishna, showing He was — they called him Yogeshwara — He was the Lord of Yoga. It is because He was Virat. But He showed His form, only to Arjuna to nobody else, because nobody was like Arjuna. Arjuna also got a fright when he saw that. 

So he lived like Shri Krishna, like a cowboy He was living in Gokul and He never showed off his powers. His powers were within himself, which were expressing spontaneously. This power has wisdom and discretion, complete discretion. If it does not have, then this is not Divine power, this is some satanic power. 

Because somebody is nice to you, if you are nice to that person [is] nothing great.

Mostly we had in India people who are called as Avadhutas. They were the realised-souls who had gone away from the society, from the multitudes and gone and lived in some small little place, or some cave or some place, hidden from others. Because they thought nobody is going to understand them, so what’s the use of talking to them? They were singled out, one person here and one person there. What could they do? They were not like you, so many of Sahaj Yogis together. You have so many friends and you have so many others with you. They were lonely people and they hid themselves from the society. They would not meet people because if they tried anything they would be crucified. But not you people because you have a society, you have a beautiful enlightened society, of very good friends, of very good spiritual people. With all this, if you cannot create, then what should I say? 

You have to create something, maybe art, maybe music, maybe poetry, maybe literature, may be writing, whatever it is, you have to create. And above all you have to create Sahaj Yogis, that’s the main creation you have to achieve. That’s the main thing you have to have is creating Sahaj Yogis all over. I am there, I can go to places, can have programmes, do everything, but you have to show with your own example that this is something great: “How they have achieved this state? We should also achieve that state!”

So you will be the ones who will really inspire them, who will really make them follow you and take to a life of a Sahaj Yogi. 

Actually you are Maha Yogis if you become complete, and you have to become. Nothing is more important than becoming a Maha Yogi by which your Spirit gives joy, peace and blessings to everyone.

May God bless you!
