There was a very great poet.

And a great realised soul. Called Namadeva. He was a tailor But In the kingdom of God. He was a prince. And he met another prince. Who was a potter. And his name was Gora Kumar. Kumar means a pot. So how they recognised each other. What love they felt for each other.

They were from 2 Different places In the same way whener is me. Each other from any places whatsoever. They just feel that love, that oneness, that goodness. That belonging And as they were great poets, they described it. That I came to see here the formless God, and here I see him in the fall. Nirguna is the formless. And uh so is the fall. The beautifully put everything so bad. It's very touching. And gives me a great hope.

That whether you are From India or from England or from America or any other country, you are all born of one mother. And you realise souls of a very high degree. The sign of a very good high sho. Is that he recognises the divinity in another person. And enjoys that. worships it and loves it. Same way I'm there. Met Nanaka. He went to Punjab. And his poems are written by Sinanaka.

In his great book called Granza. So how he respected. This gentleman from Maharashtra and he was in. Punjab. So the distance. Does not matter. What matters is the oneness. In your spirit. That time there was no mother to tell them. No one to guide them.

They All alone in different places. But whenever they had a chance to meet, they would travel for miles together. To see each other. And enjoy each other's company. I see that vision now among you all. So thank you very much. It's a very beautiful song. I wish you had known Marathi language. It is not easy to translate the whole thing. This is a song written by another great poet, great poets we have had all great saints and poets, and the song is so subtle and so beautifully blended with the rustic life that in every village they sing this song.

I wonder how many really understand the subtleties. It's a thing that I'll ask for the yoga from my mother. But then throughout what she says is that I will give up all these attachments that I have. I will give up my false pride, I'll give up my ego in in a way as if uh. Uh, you give up all your funny relationships and funny, uh, ideas of relations, and I'll become absolutely without attachment. And then you give me my yoga, they're asking the mother, but also, it also says that you will, I will. Then collect all the flowers of my board, you know, the word both means it's what you feel on your central nervous system. All the experiences on my central nervous system. I'll collect them as flowers in my flower container and I'll give it to you. It's a very, very subtle song, you know, when you, I didn't know it.

I mean, I didn't hear it that. Intensely as I did it today, and then it says that so I'll cross this. Across this ocean of illusion passed through the tunnel, and this is the Brahmana through the tunnel at the end of it because Inaha was a great. Very great poet and a realised soul, he said these things in a very local language, I should say very rustic language, and in all the villages they sing this song, so that basically the roots are there. People are not naive, you see. This is what it is in this country that especially in Maharashtra, it's not difficult to talk to them about self realisation, about Kundalini, about anything. It's gone into their blood, and this is surprising. It's just a folklore. It's a folklore. Such a subtle one And it's a fast number.

Mhm. Yeah You have the 9 descriptions of the 9 salvation of the goddess in the 102. It's on the And and goes for the crossing of the limits. Where she crosses the barriers. Beautiful because. It is said that she takes different forms, and that's how I've described all the forms of the goddess. Yeah They went on vibrations. Uh OK. His poetry is beyond really any logic, any. Mental understanding, so great, so great, and how he got all these words put together. It's such little alliteration, all kinds of metaphors, all the figures of speech, and in such a fast way sings so beautifully done.

So may God bless you. Now, this is the last cell. Or a last melody of paroby. And after that, You know that tomorrow morning. You have to go And uh maybe. That you can go late. You need not get up very early. But But I hope You'd get up by 9. And leave by 9:30. Uh, because it'll take about 1.5 hour.

To reach Uh, the river where you are all going to be stationed very well near this beautiful river which is known as Bravara. And they say that you should take a bath in the river Ganges, but you should drink the water of river Provara. And you'll be stationed there. And A beautiful surrounding. But you'd like to have a bath also, so the sooner you leave, the more time you'll have for a bath. If you reach at 11, you'll have 2 or 3 hours. If you reach at 12, you'll have 2 hours. So it is for you to choose. You can take your time. It's all arranged for you.

So the one was saying the food will be ready at 2 o'clock. So he organised it in such a way that's a 1.5 hour journey. And 2 hours. Minimum of a bath. So whatever time you think proper, you better leave. And have a nice time there. I may be there may not be there. I can't say. And after that, We have to go for the public programme in the evening so you can dress there. It's a beautiful garden, they say.

And next day we have to go. To Rahuli. Topoa, I'm sorry. So that's how it is going to be. Moreover, at this juncture, I would like to thank great musicians who are sitting here. Mr. Saar has been such an asset to Sergio. He has brought Beautiful melodies. Beautiful songs of great devotion and dedication. As such Laing rhythms. That you all are enjoying it.

So much. I hope to invite him some time to London and to other. Western countries and to America. This is the same joy that one feels for a surgery. As you are allergies and he is also Sir Jogi, this joy is so. Much mutual. I thank all his party and all the other people who are here, and his brother who is singing so well and all the ladies who have such melodious voices. All of them have been very, very kind and Very adaptable because I don't know what happened to this Mr. Temple when he reached and why we were late. I just didn't understand, whatever it is. We must be very grateful to God.

For Bringing us together in this manner. In Singing The praise of the Lord. Insert surrender modes. It's a very rare sight for me, very rare sight. I really enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm especially thankful to Doctor Sangwei Harsh and his family and the family of Doctor Sang. All the others who have helped him to make this visit so successful. From all the surgeries, I would like to thank them very much for making this spontaneous stay so successful. Last but not the least, I thank all of you. For bearing up lots of inconveniences.

In this country of ours. Yeah, it's very comfortable for the spirit, but not so comfortable for the body. I hope the rest of the journey would be better, more comfortable. I'll enjoy it more. There were certain mistakes and that's how some of the things were left behind, and some people must have had a bad time. But inside yoga, you have to forgive and forget and enjoy the best. So I won't be able to meet you tomorrow, maybe before the public programme, or maybe I might be there. I don't know. I don't know about myself. Yes.

It's a funny situation. And last of all. I've got something for you spread on the ground. For everyone, I've got a present today. And something to cover up yourself. For the ladies, it's different for the gents, it is different. And I hope God. They're all lying there and Harsh will tell you to whom it belongs. Uh, they are all handmade things from the villages and hand printed, absolutely from the villages. And a very subtle if you see them.

Moreover, they'll be useful to you in this country. And when we go to Brahmauri, we'll wash them. And they'll become very soft. Just now they are hard as in the beginning, it's rather hard in India. So now we have got something very, very nice for you. Deanely out of the car, that's all. And then we'll have the last music. They just had to take it to see hung huh Tony. You heard that song sung in in England Bhimsen Joshi sang this song as Kanhaujihongadi, and he said gongadi is a, uh, rustic type of a blanket which is used multipurpose. And he says that that is such a beautiful one means this body.

And while mine is not so good, I'm full of pride, I'm full of ego. I have so many funny things in my head. What sort of a gong you've given me. That's why I'm giving you one gonglis which you can enjoy, but sitting down and spreading and it's very good and when you wash it, uh, it becomes very soft and nice. So that's one thing and then there's a. One sheet for men and one sheet for ladies. They also look very crude to begin with, but if you wash them, they'll become very nice and they can be used for various purposes. Can you breathe? Such a lot. Thank.

Uh, Jacalai. Some for small little girls, you see, also for smaller ladies, we have something smaller for the bigger ladies something. Uh, This one for the man. It's very interesting. This one is, let me see. Now this one is for a little girl. Say Natalie can have this. Natalie come along. To cover herself. Now this is interesting because I think the men would love it.

It's a beautiful piece of art, all handmade. I'm gonna need $2 for. And this is born by the aboriginals here. And it's all done with hand, you can see, so it's quite subtle. So this is for the men and that's for the ladies and. How to find it, just cover it. Let's see. And this is for the A size for each one of you. For sitting down for meditation, for anything that you want to have is well uh. It looks nice, isn't it?

Yeah, so you can get it distributed now if you want or later whichever way you want. So I've got all these things today. How do you like this one for the mat. And this one for the ladies. But you know this. Some are small. I'm somewhat big. So there are a 4 in one. So somebody should take charge and distribute it properly. Even bigger than this other, so it depends on you just distribute it according to the sizes.
