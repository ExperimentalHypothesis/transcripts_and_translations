Yeah, Matiasha to shirataya mamasatu uh madumas means, uh, sweet, you know, I mean this the mother is very compassionate, big heart, like a big sky you father then. The means she has given us so many blessings means those who sincerely worship you, you give them realisation, yeah, then you say means means most of the time I make mistakes you have to say that I make mistakes. I do good things. I make mistakes, but you forgive me. That's the meaning, yeah. So everybody ready now? We can, ah.

Amass shakti means mother. Anti means the ultimate god ultimate. Hey Adima, hey, you are, you are the primordial goddess and you are the ultimate goddess, yeah. Right, it's a good song. Somebody in uh Bombay wrote this Jitend Ravisheki. Have you heard Jitend Rahihey? He wrote. No, Damle wrote the last stanza. Damle wrote the last stanza. Mother played this song very well on the harmonium, so when she comes down, maybe are likely to come down.

When she comes, we'll ask her to play, and we can all sing. Yeah. We can sing, uh, where is Karan, huh, Karan. Anything, Dorothy? Ah, sukarta we can, but can you sing sabakoduna. Huh, yeah, we can sing in the form of baja or suburb. That I mean bigger, yeah, that's a good one too, yeah. Correct. No, we can do that. I'm sorry.

There is a break, you mean tea break? No tea break? Shit for something. Shit. What is this? Mommy's there and Martha is there. And what about you? He's here. Everyone is here, all right? Uh, good.

I didn't tell you that. Yes, you have that, huh, so you all have been enjoying a lot, huh. That's good. Have Now today's meeting was very successful, I should say. The lawyer got his realisation. Everything has worked out. I, today's lecture was good, I think, about our culture. In general I told you what is to be done. And how to achieve it. Am I?

Yes, I'm sorry. it. All right. Now I've been Trying to find out why in the west. Sir Jui after realisation catch from others. Not in it. Now the difference is like this, we don't know what sketch means. Supposing you get pain from somebody else or you feel pain on one finger, I feel it quite a lot. If you feel the pain in your head, you feel the pain in the stomach, or you feel the pain on your fingertips. Then of course it's a serious matter.

But even if you feel the heat and the cold. Also Well I should think about it. If you feel the Tingly Still, you're not catchy. You're like a barometer. You're just feeling what is wrong with the other person. So if it is heat. That my miss. It is a right-sided problem, a physical problem. If you feel the cold, it means the left sided or the tingling. Means a left-sided problem.

But could be on the right or left, could be anywhere. Could be a combination, but now you are feeling it. But you reach a stage here very easily, I've seen. That you don't feel anything that you have gotten, you don't feel anything. But what happens actually is that. You accept The suggestions that come. From the catches and you become them. That's a real catch. But a person doesn't feel anything. He cannot feel his ego, Can feel his super ego, Can feel his chakras.

Then a person is really caught. Such a person may feel the catches of others, but not not of it. Then you are caught up because the ideas of catches. are working through it And this is a very common phenomenon. You ask the French, I said, like this. How are you? Understand anything you like. You ask anyone according to the nationality and the style, they all say they are wobblies. That's truthful. That's honest.

But it's not good. Everything truthful need not be good. So I was wondering what's the matter? Uh today Doctor Bolier gave me a very good point. He told me they are not steady people to begin with. It's in the west people are not steady. The roots Are very light And also the people who come from India, many become like. So they're unsteady people like the trees with or we can see the plants with very small roots. So the wind comes, they go to the left or to the right. The roots are taken So there is no depth.

That's why it happened. It can be any way. It can work out any way. Say it goes to the ego, you start cheating yourself. At the Or you start shouting, start saying things. In a way that you should not say. Is Michael here? No, yeah. All right, come and sit here. Sudar And then a person is he never wants to get out of it.

He doesn't want to get out of it, especially if it's an ego. He will shout, he'll scream. He'll intimidate others. He'll be jumping on the person. Doing all kinds of things, but he will not try to get out of it. That's one thing about ego. The biggest problem is he never tries to get out of it. At worst he will try to cheat himself or she will try to cheat herself very nicely. Always try To tell, oh, I'm happy. I'm all right.

You are all right, but others are not. Because ego aggresses others. So a person who is aggressive doesn't feel the burn. Or the heart It goes on like that. Actually, such a person has to get into a very big turmoil or a very big problem or a very big hit to get out of it. It's not easy. After, after all, after realisation, you should start seeing your ego clearly. If you are still shouting one thing, if you are particular about time. That's a sure and certain sign of a very big ego. Throw away your watches.

Just throw away your watches. That's one of the ways I've seen people assert their ego. Start now, this, that. So what? The speediness, the exactness, you must do this by this time. It must finish at this time. We had one horrible fellow who came with me to America first time. I had a bad time with him. But then we sent him by another ship. He was an ambassador and this and that.

I'm very particular about finishing the programme at 9, but I would start it at 9 just to tease it. Uh, I finish at one o'clock. And then we threw him out. Absolutely he was such a useless fellow. We got fed up with him. I said you are a liability to good for nothing. Get out of such. And then, you know what happened, he was such a frightened man. I don't know what happened to him. He was telephoned to me.

That the customs came to him. I don't know why customs went to I I never knew what was happening. Customs people came to him and asked him if he had smuggled some things. And I was shocked, you know. I said, no. How is it? he said, You better come to the police and tell them at the customs that I never smuggled anything. But I said, Sir, you never smuggled. No question, but you never travelled with me, came by. But still, you better come, please.

I beg of you, please come and tell the customs. But I said, how are they asking such a stupid question like that? That you have smuggled something. So I said, all right, I mean, he was so humble down, so humble down because all his reputation was at stake. So I went with him. And I asked him, what is the problem? They said, No, you just don't come into this. This man has smuggled diamonds you know for. Myself, can you say such a thing to such a man. He was my husband's boss once upon a time, such a big man like you.

He also contested election for presidentship in India, you can imagine. And he wanted me to certify that he never smoked. So I said, what makes you think that way? He said, we have got reports from Hong Kong Bank. We've got reports from Los Angeles, uh, that he purchased diamonds in Hong Kong. He took them to Los Angeles and he gave. Actually came by another ship, so I did not know. Then I discovered that on the other ship when he was travelling, he was very egoistical fellow troubling everybody, uh, getting after the cooks, getting after this person, I must have food at this time and that time. So then I discovered that all the crew had decided to throw him overboard. And they planned it very well to say that he got drunk and fell off, that they can do very easily, all of them.

But then I think they saw my photograph in his room and all that, so they stopped it, they did not. When they came back, they did all this mischief to inform the customs about. But actually he was harassed for months together and then I discovered it and I saved him out of that. He was harassed. And they gave exact date when he arrived, when he came, when he went to Hong Kong, everything into such details. That I didn't know, and they joined hands with the ship by which we had gone. Because he troubled everyone with his time with his 8 o'clock means 8 o'clock. I want to have food at 8 o'clock. And the ship people got angry because this was a ship which was, uh, what do you call? A merchant ship and we were allowed to go as travellers because we, my husband being the chairman, was we got the owner's cables in that he travelled, but he tried to show off so much that he said that I must give him my room and he should stay in my room.

Captain said that we can't do because this is the owner's wife because of her grace you are here. But he fought so much as it better you but Captain Woo. And I did not know even our ship had decided to throw him overboard. So now, but it was impossible for me to take him out of his ego because he would not realise it. Very hot tempered man is to intimidate people and to shout at everyone, and first, of course, people got frightened, but you know, people are very different types. And whenever he passed through this to behind him, say like this. I would say as a person are you doing? All of them, nobody had any respect for him because he had no respect for him. And then this captain came and he told me that we hated that man from the bottom of our heart. He was, he had showed no respect to you also.

I said no, no, he was respectful to. But he showed no respect to us. You were so kind. You were so compassionate. You were so respectful. You were so nice, and this fellow was trying to show off so much that we all hated him because he had no respect. He has travelled all over the world. He was an ambassador, this thing, that thing, and this ego comes up on such people. All right. Forgive them for that, but they cannot come in surgery.

Such people are prohibited to come in surgery. So we have to understand first of all, we have got. In ourselves a tremendous Type of ego which keeps us away from reality. There's a big gap. Here is reality. It is sir here. You cannot be combined with the reality, but in between lies this horrible stuff, colleague. Which intimidates everyone makes everyone miserable. Cannot get out of it because it doesn't make you miserable at all. I feel happy also.

Egoistical person is always very happy because he can dominate every person. He dominate his wife or dominate her husband, do all kinds of things to dominate and enjoy and satisfy them. This is what the whole of the West did. Once upon a time they went round up to China, I imagine. They were rounded up to. All the places that was possible tried to dominate. Thank God, Columbus missed. Coming to India, otherwise you would not have seen me here. He would have killed all of us and put all the Spanish, and then on top of that all the Portuguese and all kinds of few people would have been there in India and we would be somewhere dead permanently. As I finished the races here, do you know?

We are enjoying on the graves of these people with the ego. How can God forgive Americans for that? What have we done? Do we deserve? To enjoy all these things, we are plunderers actually if you think so real plunderers coming to somebody's land occupying it nicely, sitting there in a cult of power. Thinking ignorant of yourself, stupid as we are. We are thieves. We are thugs. Taken advantage of the simplicity of history, but God doesn't forgive such aggressors. That's one big problem.

With that thing in you. You cannot be deep. As soon as you'll go deep, you'll see this. You don't want to go deep because you don't want to face your ego. As soon as you go deep, you see your ego, and you're going to left to show thee finished. But after realisation. You can go. With complete confidence that we are going to see our ego nicely of our forefathers, we are the only ones who can save the souls of these horrible people who came on this earth, on this side of the earth, and killed so many Indians. You're the ones I Otherwise, all these souls will become worms or something in the hell, I think I don't know what they can become. The big responsibility.

And in that responsibility, you should become deeper. I've seen ego is such even in Sergioga we have had people who made money out of Sergioga with their ego. What's wrong? OK They can't forgive themselves all the time. There's no problem. But they can't forgive other people. And I tell you it is easier. To cure a person who suffers from left side than to cure a person who suffers from right because the left sided person feels the pangs. He gets the aches very badly, he behaves like a mad person, he gets muddled up. He gets cheated.

Everybody dominates him. He becomes miserable, so the left-sided person. Can be easily, but always a right sided person will say I'm left sided, it's not. And that is why one should understand that evil is to be faced openly, clearly is bravery. And see to it that the single person. But people have never talked about it in the West about ego. It's a recent talk. Nobody talks because if I read Saturn, who was a recent philosopher, if I read this horrible fellow Steiner, he's a recent fellow. Uh, even in the advertisement they say, oh, what a great thing it is to smoke. So nobody recognised it for a long time, but in India it was recognised long, long time back.

So they said, oh God, give me everything, but not the stupid ego from. Very childhood that taught ego. We cannot say many things which you easily say like I hate you. I cannot see What do you think of yourself? What are you to hate? Hatred is a disease, and how can you have that disease? Keep your eyes open. Hatred is A dirty things. Like eating filth. How can I say I am eating filth do it.

That's how we've learned not to say, not to think. If you hate someone. If you go and tell your mother I hate such a person, she'll give you two tight slaps on the face. No argument, nothing. That is how in India people are very deep people. They may not be so afraid. They may not be so sophisticated. They may not be so clever, maybe everything, but in evolution part they are much higher because they have very, very deep roots. Once they find Sajoga. Once they come to it, if they are not westernised, that's a very big if.

They take to Sayga so easily they never catch. I've never heard of anybody by catching. Like Means they catch in the sense that they are like bar barometers or they give barometric reading. But they never catch in the sense you today you find a lady, uh, extremely sweet and nice go to her house, she gives you food next day she she looks at you like it. Uh Digress That's not possible. There's consistency there Now today supposing we have Doctor Blier here see me tomorrow you won't find him shouting at you. That's not. Or today you find somebody very honest in the West is very common. I see, very, very common. You trust somebody who is an honest man, make him a, say, an accountant.

Next time you find you're decamped with money. If somebody's honest in India, then he's honest all his life. If he's honourable, he's honourable all his life. Then he doesn't change like this. What is the reason? There is no debt So when you get realisation, you just don't touch your depth to live superficial. So now we have to forget from where we have come. We have to know where we have reached. We have become the spirit now. Forget your past, forget the style you have let, forget everything.

Humble down. Humbling down is important. Humble down in your hearts. If we have to grow, we have to go deep. Only through humility through the weight. Through the weight of humility. Not condemning yourself. Not saying that you are wrong, your forefathers were wrong nothing, just stumbled off. And grow inward. We must know our weaknesses.

This is the biggest problem in the West. We never want to see our own weakness. And the other weakness is in the best is, it's now it's very complicated society. Like supposing I want to say that see your son is like this. Then they don't mind taking the blame of the son's misbehaviour upon themselves, though it may be I have done it. So that it never reaches the site. But if I say you have done something, they'll say no, perhaps maybe my mother because she treated me psychologically, something happening to me, so it has happened. Because I was born in a family which was very strict, I had a broken home. That's why it does happen A thing of the You are a spirit. All these explanations are against you, are going against us.

You are cheating yourself. Because I come from such and such place, it has happened now. I'll give you an example of you imagine who you know very well. You know, when he came, actually when Indians come here, they also develop some sometimes this ego part. He came to France for my. I, to, to so many people, Yogi is like a sort of a guru. He has a beard and he has a moustache like that. It's. And sometimes he has a big ego, but more than him, his disciples have a greater eotic. And those people who work here with him also get into such big big ego trips that we are having a horrible time.

I sent one of them to a To Australia. Had to take up a job. So he would not take up any job. People said, what is it? I was chief executive of Margins Export Company. What was he exporting? Those lay backs. Vomiting. He was the chief executive. And now he can't take up any other job but the chief executive.

And nobody is exporting clay packs from Australia, so he's without a job. Yeah. So he's without a job. I told him, you better dig some. Yeah. And we'll export it. First, do the digging. Then we'll export it to me. So all. This kind of a nonsense comes.

Indians, though, I mean, MSSCP is occupying such a big position. I mean, if you see him where he is, but whatever it is, but he's much more humble than many of the surgeons. Though sometimes he also goes off because you see in this country you pump up the people so much that maybe. Sometimes, but he sees it now, now he sees it and he was telling me it's the best way to get out of it. is to see He sees it and every time he does something he always asks for forgiveness, as always. You asked for for for forgiveness from me. But he told me this country so that where you get blown up. People would pumper you so much. Because you have a position. Yes, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir.

But even those who are garbage cleaners have the same issue. Even worse than C, much worse. So what is the reason? Why this bumptiousness, why this wrong ideas about yourself? It is because we are not one with reality, and we have no joy. We cannot grow artificial. So if you can some or others see that horrible thing called ego. And watch it nicely. First thing that should happen, I would say an example of that if you don't mind, I'll say more. He had a tremendous.

Evo is to power 100. 108 When he first came to be. But I knew one thing about this man that he loves truth. This is the part there where I found his debt. Lee love There were up to hit him. I see now today what a product. What have you achieved in Sergio? I mean, he met me only 4 years back. Can you believe it? The first time when he came.

He was roaring like a liar. I mean everything was there. Everything fizzled out gradually. He was so angry with me, shouting at the top of his voice, doing all sorts of nonsensical things. Can you believe Warren was shouting at me? Can you believe? But I could see that in him that he loved. I go up to a point. If I don't see you coming out of that ego, you will have to get out of. All that you have enjoyed in Sir Joga you'll have to give up.

I tell you that today. You'd better learn this lesson. When you come to India. Came through, no doubt. Then we'll be having ashrams where you can come and stay and see for yourself, double up your time. But we cannot have burdensome people. Who pulled down other erogiserogins tried to bring problem for collectivity. We cannot afford it. Like a boat We have to cross over. All of us are in the boat, and some are Jonahs.

They should be thrown out. Should we make the boat sink for them? So no liabilities will be accepted in surgery, I promise you. Since I've come here I've been sick. Humble Humble In humility. In righteousness You will find your own glory, the light of you. Not in. In ego you're blind. You can't see it. Only in humility.

In that silence of humility you'll find your own glory, your own dignity, everything you'll find in humility. But not by condemning yourself. But in humility. That's the time really you help yourself and love yourself when you are humble. So it is said, humble down in your heart. Said that I've got the picture of my mother in my heart. I have to just bend my head and I see it there. Just to bend my head and I see my mother's picture. What But keep it up The thing is, you cannot keep this tempo of humility. You have to keep it up.

I come here all right. Everything is fine, good. Again I come back. I must be prepared to suffer for 2 or 3 days again. Then you're all right, but this is only working through me. To my efforts. What about you yourself Aita? I tell you You don't have to exert at all. To be helped. But there's one way you can do it.

Always tell yourself. So for example, now. We have Michael here. And say He said from America. I said, you, Mr. American. Will you behave yourself? Address yourself. You Michael American, will you behave yourself. And come down to reality now. Do you know you are the spirit.

Address yourself. Address yourself like that, stand before the mirror. Separate yourself, say that is your ego, and you are the spirit. I talked to. You don't exist. Do you know what you are? You're not. If there is light In front of me there will be no reflection us. You are like my shadow. Go Because I'm standing before a mirror, you exist otherwise don't exist anymore.

And I can create infinite number like you. How, put another mirror behind. And there will be infinite. Images these artificial ones I can create in 1 2nd. But you can't create me. You cannot influence me. You cannot bring me down. I'm the spirit. Has to be taken up otherwise I tell you. Some of you will start looking like orange z or.

Genghis Khan. For Hitler. Or something like that, see, all these, you suddenly I find among suchies some Hitler standing with the moustache and the hair like that, the nose like that. But suddenly I find someone like that. It's quite possible. I mean what I have seen of Sergio guy in the west, I'm surprised to see. You leave somebody as a little sparrow, and when you come back, you find a hawk. That the same person. Yes, now she's become aha. Only possible in the west, I can tell you.

If you tell somebody in India, they will not believe. Like Mister Jekyll and Mister Hyde, only possible in the West. When I read this story, I said, how can it be possible. Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I said, how can it be possible? But I've seen it. It happens here They, when they are good, they're very, very good, and when they're bad, they're horrid. But that's only in the West. You don't find this in India. Why? The reason is we are deep.

Into ourselves really deep. All right, you have not missed anything now. Because you got your realisation as they've got it, you've got the knowledge of surgery as they've got it. But test it upon yourself. And humble down yourself. Go down into yourself facing yourself. Just telling yourself, no, I have to agree deeper and deeper. I'm not going to listen to anything. Ego and all that nonsense. I'm not going to listen.

I'm going to go deeper into. And move into yourself, ed yourself into reality. Piercing through all these ego or nonsensical ideas that come. Then only you can correct it, otherwise you can. The best way in meditation I've seen to improve your ego is to meditate on my feet. My feet Have that magic. Have you got photographs of my feet? I don't find anything here. Yeah, we just bring one, just bring one. All right, watch that.

They're very small one this one this is this is not this kind, one. Ah, see. A place. So Ah, that's it. They are reflecting too much though the light, huh. Can we take out this? Yet lots of these small kinds they have. Change Later Mm. Now the 2nd group can come in. Are you all right now?

Better. Still there. Beat yourself with shoes. I tell you, beat yourself with shoes. That's the best way, go and beat yourself with shoes, all of you. Now those come and just. P Very simple feat. All the people at the back come right in. Get some Puja ones also, yeah. No need to rub my feet.

Those who have not rubbed my feet can rub with the kumum with who died. Those who have not rubbed my feet so far should wait, and, uh, others can meditate a little bit on the feet. God bless her.
