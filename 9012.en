Shri Mataji: And now, we must really thank Guido for organizing so beautifully the whole thing and his wife who’s working very hard here, and all the Italian Sahaja Yogis.
[Applause]
And in Milano must thank also Gulio, the way he organized, it was a beautiful thing and other people like Ernesto, and Adriana, who took so much interest in organizing and specially I must say about our Bolivian friend who’s name is rather difficult, but I know that! 
It’s very easy because if you “caviar” and you just put the “caviar” that’s all! Caviar who-and his wife- have really done so well, it’s remarkable. 
An now we are going to have a program also in Venice, were I’m sure, Vienna people will come down, and also people from Milano will go and work it out. I’m sure we’ll achieve something great there. 
May God bless you all.
33:50

34:14
He’s told me also that it’s going to be arrangements like Brahmapuri here for all of you. I hope you’ll enjoy your stay of Brahmapuri here. [Shri Mataji is laughing]  
Alright. So let’s have some other music and also we have to thank all the musicians who are helping us here, to sing so beautifully in such a concord, in such tune! It’s beautiful I tell you, I’m really amazed. Otherwise, first of all, you used to sing in such funny ways, that I used to be frightened! That first the Deities will run away then the Ganas will run away.
[Laughter]
And now they are also dancing with you and singing with you so beautifully.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]  
It’s beautiful: talas, suras, everything beautiful is. 
May God bless you all.
Alright. So let’s have another music now.
[Guido translates]
Sahaja Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji
Such a beautiful family, swimming together so beautiful.
Alright, let’s have another one.
[Guido translates]
Shri Mataji: Hum? 
Guido: I’m translating.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: I know what you were saying. Italian is a very easy language.
Guido: I think so Shri Mataji.  
Shri Mataji: Ah. 
Elementary.
Guido: Elementary. Oh, this is a very famous one. Very famous song. [O solemio ?]
Shri Mataji: I see. Famous song from Naples. 
37:10

54:38 
Shri Mataji: So much vibrations, just feel. 
Just flowing out you see? You want to have the puja tomorrow or not? 
[Laughter]
Tremendous. 
Sahaja Yogi: I think it’s good to say “Yes please Mother”. 
Shri Mataji: Hum? What did you say? 
Guido: He says it’s good to say “Please Mother.”
Shri Mataji: It’s tremendous, really. I think it’s going to be great tomorrow.
[Sahaja Yogis sing “Mataji, Mataji”]
[Shri Mataji keeps smiling and starts laughing out of joy]  
What joy, I tell you!
It’s a, another discovery that all the leaders are such good singers. I didn’t know Arnaud used to sing so well. It’s such a deep voice he came out. All of you are so musical minded and so rhythmic that my joy, you see, is really bumbling with music and music and music. 
May God bless you. So beautiful! Very beautiful. Everything is so beautiful. 
1:08:33

1:18:54
Shri Mataji: French Sahaja Yogis. Now the French Sahaja Yogis will sing.
Shri Mataji: You sing “Amibi Gadalo” you are all experts on that 
Sahaja Yogi: We can sing one French?
Shri Mataji: Hum? Oh I think, please, all of you, some French. 
1:23:17

Guido: Switzerland
Shri Mataji: Really? Who’s done this? 
Sahaja Yogi: Arnaud has written the words. 
Shri Mataji: Beautiful, I can see.

1:29:50
Shri Mataji: Beautiful, very well done. Very well done, beautiful.
That’s a poet, poet is born. Alright, such poetry, beautiful.
One better than the other.

Now. What about? Switz, I’ve given one.
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji we would like to present you Jerusalem in two voices,
Shri Mataji: Good idea. But that should be the last I think.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Alright, any other?
You want to sing?
Shri Mataji: Ami bi [?]….
Sahaja Yogi: They’re Austrian.
Shri Mataji: Austrian? What about Austrian?
[Sahaja Yogis sing Shri Ganesha]

Shri Mataji: Shri Ganesha is already awakened, awakened and blissfully dancing. [Hindi]
Wonderful.
Guido: You can give hand to our tabla player.

Shri Mataji: So, it’s remarkable how you people manage it in parts and synchronizing. It’s harmony, you see, it’s not arranged so much, the way you, four people, five people, one singer singing the same, another same alto, another one is at the soprano and there’s another one soprano. [Laughter] And they keep it up, that’s the point, that the way you keep the parts is really great, isn’t it? It’s because of the harmony within yourself, absolute harmony. But Indians will find it difficult to keep based with you. They don’t know this, singing in parts, they don’t know.
Hum, beautiful it is, it’s a very good idea, to sing in parts gives you the fourth dimension of Shri Ganesha.
So now.

Sahaja Yogi: Jerusalem

[A Sahaja Yogi sings a song:
Jaya Ambe, jaya Jagadambe,
Jaya Nirmalama, Jaya Durge]

Shri Mataji: Woo, very beautiful, very nice.
What a nice combination of so many people of various countries, singing the pray of the Goddess. The whole atmosphere is really vibrant and it is such a great future which has come really sakshat today, which I’ve dreamt of. In my childhood I used to dream of this. Today it’s before me. I’m very grateful to you. [Shri Mataji is doing namaste]
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, we have also dreamt to be before you in our childhood.
Shri Mataji; Hum? [A Sahaja Yogi repeats it]
Shri Mataji: Yes, I know. I know that but I thought you are all lost. How will I meet you? And the whole dream has come true today.
And My father used to ask me: "What do you dream?" I said: "I want to meet all the seekers of the world. That’s what I want, all over the world, all the nations." He said: "How will you do it?" I said: "I’ll manage, somehow." [Laughter]
As a very little girl. And then he said: "What should you give, what should I give you? For yourself, what do you want?" I said: "I’ll need one hut and a very big field of sugar cane." So he said: "What will you do with the sugar cane?" I said: "From one sugar cane, you can make ten sugar canes. That’s how I’ll make many, many sugar canes."
They never used to understand what I was trying to say to him and I told him that: "As there are stars in the sky, I’ve lots of friends in this whole world. They’re all lost now. And a day will come when I’ll meet them, all of them, definitely I’ll meet them." That’s what I’m feeling now, what I told my father and that "Out of one, I’ll create ten, and out of ten, hundred, and out of hundred, thousands!" That’s what it is happening today.
And he used to think: "this little girl of five, six years, what is she dreaming about?" But he knew something about me, very much. He always said that: "I hope your dream will come true, one day." So now you know Me and I know you. We have to make more efforts to get so many there are still, out of those stars which are lost. We have to find them out, bring them here.
I want to know all of them. I want them to know Me too. This is our work, this we have to do. And one of the things is this beautiful music, which you should really make it professional. And music is one thing that can ring into the ears of those seekers and I’m sure they’ll come along.
Now in this place, I could have never thought that in Italy, somewhere, near Rome, we’ll all meet like this sing with the same voice, with the same understanding, with the same joy in our heart. I never knew this would happen really. But, somehow, I was sure that it may happen, that I may be able to do it.
It’s easy to be Adi Shakti, very easy, because if you are Adi Shakti, you are Adi Shakti. [Big laughter] You don’t have to do anything about it.
But to find your lost souls, to find them out, to establish their confidence, to make them feel alright, fearless, make them feel their hearts, their own being, their own greatness, their own glory, to make them forgive themselves, and then, make them all jump into to see of ocean. We have achieved it, really have achieved it.

This year we’ll have only three pujas in the West, one we have done, one tomorrow and one more. Doesn’t matter. But I’m sure, this year, all of you are going to have real patience with people and are going to bring people around and talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.
May God bless you.

I don’t know, I might have forgotten how to continuously play, but once I should [inaudible] 
It’s very simple. It’s just to give you a-
[Shri Mataji plays tampura. Yogis start to sing the 3 mantras]

It’s very simple, you see, to play, but it’s a matter of practice. You have to have a practice otherwise you-
