Shri Trigunatmika Puja, Overvoorde: Holland is the Holy Land. Den Haag (Netherlands) 5 July 1985

Shri Mataji : [about takings photographs]  you must take the right angle at right time. I find some people take exactly the wrong angle and the wrong time.
Sahaja Yogi : Ah?
Shri Mataji : Yes. When you get the vibrations, that’s the point you must click.
That’s it [laughs]. And because you just take it at the wrong time, photographs do not come out well for some people. Vibrations will tell you when to take. I took photographs of some people and vibrations stated flowing. [laughs].
It’s all related. Ah, come along, we have been waiting for you !….
5:47
If you want to take, take the photograph now. You see the thing is, in between you should not. You must take the photograph at a particular time, you see? Now, say supposing I’m talking, that time you should not. Or I am treating somebody, then you should not.

So we are in Holland, which is the Holy land of Europe and the Holy Land of Europe has got lots of water in it, flowing.  It's at a lower level than the Mother Earth and the sea flows through it, so it's a good combination of the sea and the earth here.  So sea cleanses and the Mother Earth blesses the people of Holland , but if they have lost their moorings and they are flying in the wrong direction, then the same Holy Land can become a hell land.  So we have to be very careful to see that we create more and more Sahaja yogis in this place.  

 

In My reading of the character of the western people I find they are extremely aggressive by nature and very egoistical on the whole.   One should not feel that I am saying about you, but I'm saying, you are Sahaja yogis, you belong to the Kingdom of God but I'm telling about in general now.   While I'm talking keep your eyes open.  I don't know why people close the eyes, I can't understand.

 

Now when we are in the Holy land we find that the Mother Earth has allowed the sea to flow in and it is a very good place for Me to say something to you.  Here the sea has taken refuge in the Mother.  The guru has bound itself with the Motherly qualities.  A person feels more safe on the ground than on the sea or in the air.  So today is the best opportunity for me to say that after the guru puja  we have to understand that to be Holy means you  must allow the guru tattwa to circulate in the Mother principle or the guru tattwa is to be controlled and guided and beautified by the Mother principle.

 

It's only the Mother Earth that is beautiful because it can create so many varieties, so many dramas, so many place, any other element, if you see, has nothing in it. So it is She who can create.   So we should take to the Motherly quality more and try to bind our guru principle through that Motherly, beautiful, creative power so that we make our presence very agreeable, very congenial, very beautiful, full of interest and varieties;  every time new flowers, every time new fruits, every time a new, new design.

 

As Kundalini is made of Mother Earth, we are quite capable of doing that.  There are gurus and gurus and gurus but no one so far is such a master as you are of the Kundalini.  If they were they would have given realization to thousands.  Why, because your Mother has penetrated into your guru principle and has risen your Kundalini, has given you powers to raise Kundalini, breaking your 7th chakra, so clearly.  That never happened with anyone, even incarnations could not do that to the masses as you are doing. The Kundalini is flowing from your hands; the Ganesha is active in you, but it should never give you the ego or the sternness or the heaviness of the sea but it should give you the beauty of the Mother Earth.  

 

Mother Earth is always bigger than the sea because She has to contain the sea.  Sea can never be bigger than the Mother Earth.  Sometimes it looks, sea, bigger but sea is contained in the Mother Earth.  It cannot go beyond.  So the Mother Earth is always greater, bigger, wider than the sea.  So one has to understand that when Kundalini has risen, you have become all of the seven chakras and not only the guru chakra and when you have become the guru chakra it is also bounded on all sides by the Mother Earth.

 

Under these circumstances, when we are so capable, we are giving realization to so many people when we are achieving so many things.   If we could just become humble, congenial, beautiful, we can master the whole world but I find in the style of Sahaja yogis, especially in the west and westernized Indians, there is so much of ego still expressed in their talks, in their behavior.  They are not capable of it, to see I think sometimes; but better see it.  First you may have to act as sweetly, maybe, but you must learn that way.  If you do not understand that all your leadership, all your guru tattwa depends entirely on the loving capacity of your Mother, Her patience.  I get angry but perhaps once in a ten years or twelve years, something like that, seldom.  That's better, then the anger has some meaning but all the time if you are in a temper or you try to show off or if you have so much of ego that you go on asserting on wrong things, then you cannot be effective.  Another thing I've seen that ego has no discretion, ego has no discretion of any kind.  If you are egoistical first thing you lose is discretion, then what's the use of having this nonsense of a ego which doesn't give you discretion?   And people who have greater ego always then assert and you have to agree to that.  You are more impressed by the people who have greater ego than yours and you like the people who are without any ego so you can oppress on them, but the discretion part is very poor.

 

That you can see, the other day one guru had, or the one gentleman, had come and he was given some mantra by his guru, but he can't hear anything against his guru.  Why?  Because his ego has chosen that guru; because the ego has chosen how can the ego be wrong?  And ego is always wrong, invariably wrong.  Everything is upside down with the ego-orientation.  Gradually you will learn that in the west people lack common sense completely, they lack common sense in everything.  I mean if they had common sense there would have been much less problems, but common sense is lacking and also I find the same thing in Sahaja yogis.  They lack common sense.  You have to become so wise that common sense should be your nature but common sense we lack.

 

Like today, today I was discussing about say, the labor problems, which is a very general problem, which is a very general problem.  You have a labor problem.  For example you have unemployment.  Now the whole system that is built in here and we too have adopted some of it but not to that extent, of working hours, is very absurd.  For example, supposing you get up at four.  I mean that's very big supposition, of course, but supposing we get up at four and we take our bath.  Morning time is very peaceful, we can meditate, we can do what we like.  Then we finish all the other work we have to do, get yourself ready, have yourself ready, have your breakfast or tea or whatever you want to have.  Then by eight o'clock you are ready for work.  Supposing you go at eight o'clock for your work.  So you can work from eight up to one o'clock very easily, very easily, no problem.  Then one o'clock you come back home, have your lunch and have a siesta.  If you can have siesta for about two hours 'til three, four o'clock , by five o'clock you again go to work.  Then you can work from five to eleven without feeling tired at all, after eleven you might be.  So you put in much more work, much less sleep and you keep fresh and young but it is, requires, common sense.

 

Now the, how unemployment can be solved; some people can work in the morning, some can work in the evening.  Now those who are working in the morning, the ladies could be in the house, men could be outside.  Then the men come out in the evening; they can do the household work.  Ladies can do in their house or when they are in the house, men can do creative work like making statutes, hand work, hand-made things.  So everybody gets employment; they became more creative, much happier people and so easy to solve the problem.  But there is unemployment; because of unemployment there are so many problems.  Very easy to solve the problem of unemployment, you don't give any social security or anything.  You give them their pay and let them work for shorter time.

 

If you make them create things and sell them, they'll have more money or they can have nice things around them.  Otherwise you can have horrid things like that.  So you can have lots of things which are hand-made, plus machine-made things, whatever you want to have.  There should be a balance.  With common sense we should know how far to go, how far to have balance.  Like machine goes on like mad, we cannot control machines because we think we get money, we do not.  After some time machines have to stop.  So you have to go up to, this, I'm trying to put the guru tattwa into the Mother Earth, that's practical. 

 

So common sense should be applied and that can only come when there is no ego.  It's ego that cannot be common sense "Because I like it, I do it".  But this "I" is the ego who is blind, who is indiscreet, who is stupid.   So ultimately we do stupid things.  There should be common sense, which one can learn by getting rid of this ego.  Now people say "Mother, how to get rid of ego?"  It's very simple, you have to move left to the right 108 times, in Sahaja yoga.  You have to forgive people, in Sahaja Yoga.  And you can watch yourself.  First of all see, do you watch others or you watch yourself?  First of all.  Like there was a lady traveling with Me, very old lady and she said "This man is handsome, this man is not handsome, this woman is good looking, she is pretty" that way.  I was just looking at her.  I said "This mad woman, she will go really crazy by the time we get down.  She goes on looking into every person, judging everyone, who is handsome, who is not."  And everybody whom she called handsome I found him ugly.  So I gave up.  I said "You better decide, I never tried these things".  Then "That man is not good, he is very hot tempered, he is this thing, he is that, he talks like that, he walks like that, he shouldn't do, look, like that", worried about other people.  You tell them anything, they'll go on shaking their neck like that, "Oh, how could you do it?"  But you do it yourselves.  If you have to say yes, then you do it ten times - yes, yes, yes, yes.  If you have to say no, they'll go on.  There is no common sense.  Why to move your neck so many times.  If somebody is saying that you need not react all the time. 

 

So this is another thing, internal reaction.  First is external, seeing everyone, judging everyone, "Oh, I don't like this station; this is too much dusty, this bathroom is not good, that room is not good, that thing is not good", like that, as if you are the Queen of England.  Even that could be even more than that because she is not even allowed to choose her dress; Parliament has to decide.  Poor thing cannot have any ego at all, poor thing.  She has to choose what dress she has to wear for a particular occasion; if the Parliament says yes, she wears.  If she says no, no, big problem, for them.  But for us, who are free people, we must have common sense to understand what to do, where to do, what to talk, how to talk, but when there is ego, you cannot have common sense.  

 

And this is the reason I think the western people have become so stupid in so many things.  Whatever I see, I see it upside down.  Indians, we may be poor people, in the villages, they are not so educated.  You are all very well educated people, everything is there but all has come out of ego, so the common sense is lacking.  So those who deal with the Mother Earth, like farmers are, have tremendous common sense.  Now in Holland I used to think people will have a lot of common sense because they are farmers you see.  When I had come in '65, they are better off, much better, not so nonsensical.  They were well dressed, nice, sensible, solid people.  Of course I met quite elderly people also, I should say, but I was surprised that in the market you could not get a transistor made in Holland , could not get anything made in Holland .  So I said "How is it you don't make anything, machines?"  You said "Why should we?  For our twenty five bulbs of tulips, in those days, we get one transistor from Japan , so why should we make a transistor?"  Common sense.  "We sent from here 25 bulbs" and they had fields and fields of all kinds of tulips, all over, I mean when I came here.  So they said "For 25 bulbs we get one transistor so why should we.  We export our bulbs to them and get their transistors.  Why should we make transistors?"  Then they said "We export our cheese to a particular country, our eggs to Italy , our chicken to this country and we get all that we need."  I was amazed you see, they are so, so proud of their agriculture and so much doing like that way, which was a very sensible thing and because they were dealing with the land I thought I'll find Holland people to be the best but then I got reports that people are absolutely gone off their heads.  They have become like bullocks now, working with the land they have become like bullocks who plough the land, you see.  I was surprised "How have they become like bulls?"  They were very sensible people, very sensible, farmers sensibly dealing with things and working out things in such a beautiful manner; very innocent and simple people and naive, up to a point of sweetness, very sweet.  

 

When we came here they wanted to please us so they wanted to put a flag for us, of our country and they put Pakistan flag in front of us.  So I was very happy to see that, and they were talking vegetarianism, but when we came my daughter had suddenly become vegetarian because she had developed a funny nausea in the, in the ship, you see.  So she was not eating any meat or anything.  So she said "I am vegetarian".  So they said "Alright, then will you have chicken?"  They were that simple you know, very simple and now they are talking about vegetarianism.  I am surprised.   Since '65 and '85 only, these twenty years, how much they have changed.  Very nice and they were, not busy doing all these exercises and reducing weight or increasing weight and jogging on the road.  Just now, yesterday, I was walking, everybody was jogging like mad, very funny, but they have lost their common sense because perhaps they do not come in contact with Mother Earth, they are using machines too much.  Maybe that is one of the reasons and must be the air from other outside countries coming and they think "They are rustic",  so they must accept that is all that is modern, sophisticated, perhaps.

 

There is a story about a farmer who was traveling by train and there were some naughty boys who came from the city so they wanted to pull the legs of the farmer.  So one of the boys asked him that "If the eggs are selling here in this station for 20 p. and in the next station the chicken is selling for one pound, what is my age?"  Just to tease him.  So immediately the fellow says "You must be 22."   He said "How do you know exactly I am 22?"   He said "Because my brother, my brother who is full mad, is 44."  You see, they are so practical.   You know, you see, as they call it in America , as "brass tacks", you see they know what is it.   He looked at him and said "22"; "How?  Why?"   "My brother, who is 44, is full mad".  And these boys didn't know where to look you see, because they wanted to tease him.   And the farmers have great sense.   Like we had one minister who had developed a bad neck, you see, [unclear] in vishuddhi.  He was Chief Minister.  He used to go on like this, his head used to go like this.  So some farmers came to see, saw him, and they looked at him.  They said "He's saying no already, what's the use of telling him anything?"  We have lots of stories of farmers in India which shows how much they understand life.

 

I had a very nice gardener, he was from a village.  So there was one fellow, old fellow, another gardener.  He said "No use talking to this old fellow".  I said "Why?" He said "If he is a Hindu, then an old man is a gone case."  I said "Why?"  "Because in young age they live like ascetics and in old age they become like bhoots, but if he is a Muslim, they don't live like ascetics in young age.  They enjoy life and in old age they are satisfied souls.  So you better talk to a Muslim old man than to an Hindu old man."  I mean the reading is so correct about things, you know.  Everything that he said was so practical and so sensible.  I was really surprised how he could say these things with such sweetness and with such goodness and how he understood so many things so well.  And he was a very young fellow; about I would say thirty to thirty two years of age.  

 

So he came to Bombay to see us.  He didn't know our full address, he only knew Marine Drive so he told the fellow, his taxi fellow, "You drive me at Marine Drive ".  He said " Marine Drive is a big place".  He said "You drive me anywhere in Marine Drive ", so he drove.  So he went and asked "Is there a very tall gentleman staying in Marine Drive somewhere?  And you see, my husband is one of the tallest in Indians, you see.  So he went to the servants, asked "Have you seen any tall sahib anywhere?"  He said "Just one tall is staying there, you see".  So that's how he came to our house.  And he showed them his shoes, "This shoe is given to me by my sahib, he is also very tall, you see".  So he said "This shoe he has given me and he wears the same style of shoes".  So servants notice all these things, they are very practical people.  So another gardener who met him, he said "Yes, there's a tall fellow and he wears the same type of shoes".  And so he came to our house.

 

How they are sharp and how their eyes are so penetrating, how they know everything about everything.  It is remarkable, very remarkable and that is what we have to be.  We have to be gurus with the Mother's influence on us, all the time the Mother controlling us, the Mother guiding us, the Mother making our [unclear - bans], the Mother making our maryadas.  So the Motherliness is your blessing.  Today you are raising your Kundalini because your guru is a Mother; otherwise you could never have done and that is why Motherliness is so important.  One of the reasons, perhaps, why the Sahaja yogis run away from the leaders and sometimes from the people who want to have follow-on, maybe, that we do not know that they are just entering in, just opening out.  So try to be kind, just hatching, the little chicks, you see, will die very fast.  You have to handle them very, very carefully.  I am saying this after so many years of not saying this and I am requesting all of you, try to develop.  Sit before the mirror and try to act like a Mother.  Better see, practice it, try to be nice, kindly, gentle, patient.  If you want to spread Sahaja Yoga in the west we have to do that, not in Maharashtra, Maharashtra 's Mothers are quite strict and they are straightforward and children are used to it.  You might find that I will say "My Mother was a very strict lady but I think I like her very much because she taught me so many things; all my sisters are expert cooks; we are very good in the life; we are doing so well in life; we don't trouble anyone".  All these things have come from our Mother.  She was a strict lady as she would not tolerate any nonsense.  She would never tell a lie herself and if you tell her "Alright, if this gentleman is coming, you tell that I am not in the house", "Don't tell me to tell lies; I'll tell him that you told me to tell the lie".  That's how she was and that's how she treated us and we lived with that but we didn't mind it because what she did was for our good.  We knew that she was doing it for our good.  Not in this country, people don't understand this fact.  They have ego, they never understand that this is for your good.  They will always understand this is aggressiveness because they themselves are aggressed or they are aggressive.  If they are aggressed, they are even worse.  

 

So try to understand what is the situation in this country.  I have adjusted Myself; you also should adjust yourself here to the way it is and that's how I should not hear any more any complaints about, now, again the guru tattwa has to go inside the Mother tattwa.   So next time I will not have any complaints but they should all say "Oh, Mother, what a nice man, he's so kind, very gentle, so very sweet".  It doesn't take at all, anything, to be that.  Now in this good atmosphere when the nature is so abundant and the sun also is hiding its own sharpness, where everything is so beautiful, we should decide that we will behave in a manner that will behoove our Mother and not fight, not quarrel, not say things.  

 

Like somebody in the train now, supposing going, will go and quarrel with the ticket collector.  "This is my seat, that is mine".  Sahaja yogi does not do that.  Sahaj, "Alright you want, alright, I'll sit here.   Alright, whatever is legal, I'll do that, whatever is proper, I'll do.  You want, alright, doesn't matter, you don't allow, alright".  Immediately the person melts away.  But if you "No, this is my seat.  I have booked it, this, that".  And then your Mother plays tricks there, on top of that.  So ultimately you find that the seat was not yours and you are looking very upset about it, how a Sahaja yogi is insulted.

 

So that is how it is going to work out in this beautiful manner if we understand the beauty of sweetness and beauty of your Mother Earth, how She beautifully creates everything and even She is so sweet, I tell you that if  you are  sleeping under a coconut tree.  Can you imagine now?

 

A coconut is so big, if it falls on anybody's head, finished; stomache, also, terrible.  It can break your bones but it will never fall on any human being or any animals.  Can you believe it?  It's a fact.  That is the  [unclear:  pritumbhara??].  That is the quality of the Mother Earth.  It never falls on any human being or animal.  How does She manage that?  And you have seen how the flowers also form, you'll never see the flowers growing, how the Mother does that; otherwise we'll have problems, you see.  Suddenly, you'll see a flower [unclear].   So She, slowly, She does it and suddenly, oh!  She makes the leaves so beautifully arranged that they all get the sun.  How She manages!  Then She creates a beautiful shade for you, the color scheme, everything so beautiful and then how She nourishes that because all the leaves drop down and they give nitrogen again to the Mother Earth and then She again nourishes them.  But the leaves have to fall down if the Sun has to come to the Mother Earth.  It is all Her doing but She does it so beautifully that we are not even aware of what She is doing to us.  We don't know.  If you notice it, the one thing about the Mother Earth, beauty that She creates and how sweetly She does it, you would say that even one billionth of that, if we have, we could be somewhere, already, ruling, in the Kingdom of heaven, is what it is.

 

So as you have got your Kundalini, you must develop that sweetness in you, in such a manner that people see you and think you are great Mothers, but as you know in the west the mothers are so horrible, the women are so dominating that people do not have a proper image of a mother also.  Women are extremely dominating.  Women must learn to dominate, it's so easy, a bull can dominate anyone but can they be like Mother Earth which can bear up all kinds of troubles, all kinds of problems, can we do that way?  Especially that's why I request women of this country to develop those beautiful qualities and not of domination.  Domination, it doesn't behoove a woman, it doesn't look nice on her.  It's like a bull, she is wearing as a diamond piece around her neck, it's not beautifying.  So we must give up that idea of dominating or trying to oppress the husband.  He says something, we say "no" to children, we say "no", to everyone we try to dominate.  That's not our character.

 

Even, I think Roosevelt once said that, of course he must have met real Indian women, that an Indian woman she is like a magnolia in an Indian forest.  Of course, here the magnolias are useless but in Indian forest, even one flower in the forest, it is hidden, you can't see it, but you can smell it.  The whole forest is fragrant, you can't see it anywhere, it is one flower, you can know this magnolia and this is the greatest quality because love is the most attractive thing in the world.  Why do you hang around Me?  Because My vibrations, My photograph has got.  No.  You feel that you are loved, that I love you.  It's a very great quality but I have that innate within Me, I don't have to have it from anywhere and you, too, have it.  Just expose it and manifest it.

 

MAY GOD BLESS YOU.

 

So today we should do actually the pujas of the Bhoomi, would be a better idea.  We'll do the Ganesha's pujas and then you worship me as the Mother Earth., as the pritambhara pragnya, which we have not done so far in the Holy land , alright.  And we have to thank all these Sahaja yogis who are so few here who have arranged all this and have done such good work.
