You see how Raulbai has So all the activity on right hand side, of love for me and in this place you all also Saraswati, basically has to end up in love. got new idea of creating a beautiful thing. Starts with love and ends up in love. And as love will increase your creativity Whichever does not end up in love, coils will develop. So the basis of all creativity up and finishes off. It just disappears. So of Saraswati is love. If there is no love you can see that even matter which is not there is no creativity. It is even in the deeper used for love, just finishes off. The basis sense, you see; people who have created has to be love. Otherwise all such matter all the scientific things are also out of love that we crate which has angularity, which to the masses, not for themselves. is not fitting into the mass media, which is Nobody has produced anything for not appealing to the masses; of course, it themselves. If they make something for takes time, you have seen that it takes time themselves it has to become for universal - but it does have that terdency always to use, otherwise it has no meaning. Even if disappear in the thin air as soon as you you say atom bomb and all these things find it does not appeal to the masses. are created from science, they are also very protective. If they had not created, Now this love of, that we talk of, the those people would not have taken out great love of God we talk of, we know that their minds from war. Now, nobody can it is, for definite, through vibrations. People think of having a big war. Of course, they do not have vibrations but still they can leel are having cold wars, but that also will the vibrations in a very unconscious way

 September-October, 2005 The Divine Cool Breeze I told you, it cannot. Because the time will All the great paintings of the world have kill it. All these things have to disappear vibrations. All the great creative works of and already you can see the result, how the world have vibrations. Only those who things are changing every-where, even in have vibrations have been sustained by time - otherwise all other things are the West. So there is no need to be so much disappointed with the West and to destroyed. There must have been say that the Western world is a waste-land. monuments and horrible statues and horrible things that have been created long It is going to be alright and it has to be done. Specially it has done lot of Puja of time back. But they are all destroyed by Saraswati. I should say in the West. Much Nature as they could not stand the impact more than they have done in India because of the KALA-that is the destructive power they have gone to learn it and they have of time. So, all that is sustaining, all that is tried to find out so many things. But only nurturing, all that is ennobling comes from thing they forgot that it is a Goddess, God this sense of love, which is within us very much developed but within others also is the Giver. Everything comes from the Goddess. That is what they forgot. And who are not yet realised. Ultimately the that is why all the problems have been whole world has to realise that one has to go to that ultimate love of God, otherwise created. If there is no Spirit in your learning, it has no meaning. if there is no source of the goddess in your learning, then it is- absolutely useless. If they had realised that there is the Spirit that Now you have seen in arts people have taken to other methods of appealing is working it out, they would not have gone that far. And that is what I was warning the to people by using cheap things and very Indians, although, that you are now taking vulgar things, just to make people think to industrial revolution in a way and to avoid that this is art. But this will all disappear. It cannot sustain the impact of the time as all the complications of industrial

 September-October, 2005 The Divine Cool Breeze revolution, you must try to know the Spirit. Christ then it is even more essential that If you do not know the Spirit you will have the purity of life, what you call 'Niti', is the morality of life. Now morality itself has the same problem as these people have. Because they are also human beings, you become very much sort of an argument in the West. People don't have any sense of are also human beings. You will also go the same way. At random you will run and absolute morality. On vibrations of course there will be problems, the same problems you know. But they have all gone against it. Those who are worshippers of Lord as the Western people have. Jesus, those who are the worshippers of Now Saraswati's blessings are so the Surya, of the Saraswati have all gone against, against the powers, of Surya, just many that one cannot describe in such a short time. And the Surya (Sun) has given disobeying it. Because you cannot be a us so many powers that it is impossible to Surya if you don't have a proper sense of morality and holiness. The Surya itself tell them even in one lecture, even in ten brings light to see everything clearly. So lectures. But how we go against Surya and many qualities Surya has got. It dries up how we go against Saraswati, while doing everything that is wet, dirty, filthy. It dries the worship of Saraswati, it is to be seen up all those places which create parasites. very clearly within ourselves. For example But so many parasites are created in the the Western people are very fond of Surya West. Not only parasites, but there are because they have no Surya. But they go too far with it, as you know, and create horrible cults and horrible things which have come into that; those countries which complications within themselves of Surya. are supposed to be full of light, and in that But the main thing that one has to achieve darkness they exist. Darkness about the through Surya is the light 'Vivek'- is the tight within. And if Surya Chakra at the Spirit, darkness about their own Agnaya level is occupied by lord Jesus knowledge and darkness about love.

And that is what one has to places where you are supposed to love understand- that this pure intelligence, is light. Light does not mean, light does not notto be soiled by our thinking. Ourthinking mean what you see with your gross eyes, Light means from within-the light of love, can make us so bumptious, so ego- That one should understand-Light of love. oriented, so impure, that we can really eat the poison and say 'what is wrong in it? And it is so soothing, it is so sweet, it is so beautiful, it is so enamouring, it is so Just the opposite of Saraswati. If abounding that unless and until you can Saraswati is within us, She give us "Subuddhi', wisdom. And that is why, to feel that light within you-that light which is of pure love - of purity, pure relationship, worship Saraswati, to worship Surya, we must have that clear vision as to what we pure understanding. If you can develop What we are doing. What that kind of a light within yourself, then the have to be. whole thing will be cleansed. "Wash me filth we are living in. What our mind is and I shall be whiter than snow.' This is getting into. After all we are here for what happens to you when you are emancipation and not for, just for pampering our ego and living with our filth completely cleansed. The purest form of Nature is within us. The purest form of that is with us. So this light has come Nature is within us. Our Chakras are within us and we should try to rise above our own mental filth which is being created made out of that 'purest' form of Nature. around us. Apart from that, you have to go We are the only people who are spoiling it by our mental thinking. higher and understand that there is, within Against the us, a thing called ego. And this ego is false, same Saraswati power, you are going against Saraswati itself. Saraswati absolutely false. You do not do anything. Actually when you turn your eyes here and cleanses all that is impure in nature, while there when your attention is here and there, with our brain activity we are spoiling all

But actually ego is an try to pull people into those horrible stuff absolute falsehood because there is only one ego and that is the God Almighty, which is described as absolute NARAKA. NARAKA is the movement of ego on all 'Mahatahankara'. There is no really any the sides. ego that exists, it is myth. It is a very big myth, because if you start thinking you are Now when people try to use their right doing everything-you are doing this, you are doing that-which you are not doing; Vishuddhi, that is, to talk about themselves, is the worst of all. Whatever then this non-sensical ego comes in and you start working it out, it can project in type of ego you may have, if you start boasting about it and talking about it, then direction. When it projects forward, every it encircles, thickens the walls of ego so it overpowers others, it tries to dominate much, that it is impossible to penetrate into others, tries to kill others, becomes Hitler. that, because such a person is completely When it moves to right side, it becomes satisfied with himself and he believes that supraconscious. It starts seeing things he is so. And once he starts believing into which are absurd, which are foolish, which a non-sense like that, its an impossibility are stupid. When it moves to left side then then-impossibility to penetrate. it starts, talking-Imean, seeing things- yourself as a big man, as a big Christ or So when you boast about these as a big Devi or something like Adi Gurus and 'l am a very great personality' that is things or you talk big, be careful, you see. You know what I am, but how many times left sided. When it moves backwards, that is the dangerous one. do l say 'l am that'.

So, one has to understand that Mahatahankara is the one that acts, that tell me about your experiences, alright, but works, that creates.

Say "Yes, some of us have, I know some people have this.' That EKADASHA. But we all must remember is the way one should do it. Because if to say 'WE' all time.

That is coming this side. So let us welcome the is how, you will make it perfectly all right. Sun, coming to the North now, this way. And Let it spread. We all SAHAJA YOGIS 'WE ALL'.

If you start thinking, 'we' domain of Sun, within ourselves. Because SAHAJA YOGIS', then what happens is Sun never disappears from our inside. So become 'one' personality, 'one' that is how we have to take a mode by which we should think of 'one' personality, organisation. 'all of us together, all of us together.' And But the person will look down upon anybody who tries to be something separate or different, he will drop out. I other people. He will see that person is will drop him out.

Like the Dhulia means the dust. whole, to help the whole, to emancipate the whole. But not to, in anyway, put anyone Dust. And one day I had written in Childhood, a poem, I remember. Very down always. Because this is not the way the Sahaja Yoga is. Sahaja Yoga only interesting poem it was - I don't know where it is now-but which said that 'I want works in collectivity. And the one who has developed this permeating spirit, to be smaller like a dust particle which is a real Sahaja Yogi. Who has not, is moves with the wind. It goes everywhere. Can go, sit on the head of a king, or can not! Whatever you may think of yourself, I go and fall at the feet of someone. And it have nothing to say. But this permeating can go and sit on a little flower, and it can personality which moves from places to go and sit everywhere. But I want to be a places, whether you talk or not. Like your Mother is. Whether I meet you or not, particle of dust, that is fragrant, that is makes no difference, but I am permeating nourishing, that is enlightening,' Like that, I had written a very beautiful poem, I was through all of you, by little-little things also I am there with you. So like that, try to about seven year of age, I remember-To be a dust partiole, 'I remember that very permeate into each other and see the clearly, long time back, 'that I should be a beauty in you. Enjoy yourself the best dust particle. So that I will permeate into because that is the biggest thing. That's the biggest thing that is to be achieved. people,' which is a very big thing to become a dust particle of that kind. To just Because this ego you know makes you whatever you touch, you see, that becomes like a nutshell and it just cannot have a enliving, whatever you just feel, that is rapport with that beauty of permeation and fragrance.

And this is the way to overcome while talking to you, I remembered that I the problems of the right side and that is wanted to be that, and that is what this how to worship Saraswati. Because place is. And Raulbai is like that. She is a Saraswati has a Veena in Her hand and very simple woman, very simple woman that Veena is the primordial instrument and she lives like a very simple person. which She plays like music, and music She has a sense of permeation. And now penetrates into the heart. You don't know how it goes into you and how it works out. there are so many Sahaja Yogis, yesterday who came; and I am sure there That is how a person who is Sahaja Yogi should permeate- like music. There are are going to be more people.I hope you so many qualities as I told you which have met all of them. Make friends with cannot be described in one lecture. But all of them. Try to know them who they one of the greatest quality of Her's is that are. They may not know English. You get somebody to translate. Talk to them and She ends up into subtler things like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance. be nice to them. Be friendly with them. I wanted you to meet them for permeation. Music will end up into inelody like that You should know who are the people here, whatever She creates ends up into something greater. Matter whatever She who are in Nasik. Because somehow we never meet the Sahaja Yogis, you see, produces ends up into aesthetics. If matter who are in that particular place. And when does not have aesthetics then it is gross, we go back we have only one or two like that everything. Now you will say what is water. Water becomes the river addresses. It is not a good idea. Try to see how many people there are. Ask Ganges! These are the subtler things. So the matter gets into subtler thing because questions about them. And all that. it has to permeate, it has to permeate. So This permeation is only possible when your ego starts permeating all everything whatever it is. And the best of

 In Memory of a Great Man The prize winning film of R. Attenborough on Mahatma Gandhi has been seen by many Sahaja Yogis throughout the world. For once the link between Gandhi and Sahaja Yoga cannot be stressed enough: in enabling Bharata to regain its political freedom. Gandhi brought back to the land of yoga its lost dignity without which it could not unveil to other civilizations the priceless secret of its spiritual tradition: Kundalini Yoga. He was, in this way, the precursor of this little girl who was staying in his ashram. I refer to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi of course. Gandhiji used to call Her "Nepali" which, indeed, was quite accurate: the Devi is the daughter of Himavat, the king of the nmountains, and the Sahasrara of the planet is in Nepal, in the Himalayas. On a general level the film on Gandhi brings to a wide public's attention some features in the life of this remarkable man that Sahaja Yogis can, perhaps, best analyse. Young Europeans do not always realize what colonialism really meant to the rest of the world. They often consider that, after all, it was a good thing to bring science and technology to other continents without realizing that only too often the colonial powers behave with gross brutality; they destroyed in the process of their so quote "civilizing mission" the delicate fabric of human and social values which, in the light of spiritual life, were by far superior to their own. The real victory of Gandhi was to beat the major colonial power of the time merely by resorting to these values. In many ways the mode of action of Gandhiji was sahaj. For instance, he firmly derived his political activity from a couple of Dharmik principles and he refused to compromise with what was wrong. These principles, his very firmness, stemmed from his (correct) conviction that it is God who leads history. Thus God answered back the call, or, in other words, the Unconscious started working for Gandhi.

 The Divine Cool Breeze September-October, 2005 How did it happen? - Gandhi's greatest leverage was his command over the Indian masses, He gained such a command because the simple folk could recognize that he was inspired from above. The people felt it from their own individual unconscious and thus they believed in the legitimacy and the credibility of his leadership; they, indeed, called him "Mahatma", gave him confidence in his mission, lent him in any possible way their support. Therefore, to take but one example, merely by his hunger strike the Mahatma could control the behaviour of millions of people. But alas, this process cannot work outside India, in countries where the common man does not have the required level of sensitivity to his own unconscious. This is why Gandhi's schemes of peaceful revolution has not yet been implemented anywhere else in the world. Other countries could, possibly have their own Gandhi. But would these lone voices be heard, let alone listened to and obeyed ? Even in India the elite of the country, the clever people, missed the best part of Gandhi's teachings. They have largely borrowed the western ways of the westem power they were supposed to have expelled and, in this respect, remained colonized. Perhaps this has been Gandhi's greatest shortcoming. He could transform a country but he could not transform men. He could bring political freedom but not the freedom from conditionings and ego. In other words, he could not raise Kundalinis. Well, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi can! This is why the spiritual revolution She has triggered with Sahaja Yoga is simply the most practical, the most effective revolution of all times. As Shri Mataji can transform the basic cell of society, man, transform him, that is, into a higher being, the gradual impact of this positive transformation will be felt in all the dimensions of society. As this transformation will be duiy opposed, there will be crises and clashes; the earth may shiver, the seas may rise. But the outcome can

 The Divine Cool Breeze 25 September-October, 2005 be predicted with the kind of quiet certainty which distinguishes Nature's doings. At the given time some eggs become chicken, some flowers turn into fruits, some people become Sahaja Yogis. Like Gandhi we should be collective and wish this new freedom for many, many more. And we should be confident about it. For not only is nature doing the job, She has even taken an incarnated form to explain us how She does it ! Really we can only wish to Gandhiji to be back as one of us... Gregoire (Nirmala Yoga) 1983

 In Memory of a Great Man
The prize winning film of R. Attenborough on Mahatma Gandhi has been seen by
many Sahaja Yogis throughout the world. For once the link between Gandhi and Sahaja
Yoga cannot be stressed enough: in enabling Bharata to regain its political freedom.
Gandhi brought back to the land of yoga its lost dignity without which it could not unveil
to other civilizations the priceless secret of its spiritual tradition: Kundalini Yoga. He
was, in this way, the precursor of this little girl who was staying in his ashram. I refer to
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi of course. Gandhiji used to call Her "Nepali" which, indeed,
was quite accurate: the Devi is the daughter of Himavat, the king of the nmountains, and
the Sahasrara of the planet is in Nepal, in the Himalayas.
On a general level the film on Gandhi brings to a wide public's attention some
features in the life of this remarkable man that Sahaja Yogis can, perhaps, best analyse.
Young Europeans do not always realize what colonialism really meant to the rest
of the world. They often consider that, after all, it was a good thing to bring science and
technology to other continents without realizing that only too often the colonial powers
behave with gross brutality; they destroyed in the process of their so quote "civilizing
mission" the delicate fabric of human and social values which, in the light of spiritual
life, were by far superior to their own. The real victory of Gandhi was to beat the major
colonial power of the time merely by resorting to these values.
In many ways the mode of action of Gandhiji was sahaj. For instance, he firmly
derived his political activity from a couple of Dharmik principles and he refused to
compromise with what was wrong. These principles, his very firmness, stemmed from
his (correct) conviction that it is God who leads history. Thus God answered back the
call, or, in other words, the Unconscious started working for Gandhi.

September-October, 2005
How did it happen? - Gandhi's greatest leverage was his command over the
Indian masses, He gained such a command because the simple folk could recognize
that he was inspired from above. The people felt it from their own individual unconscious
and thus they believed in the legitimacy and the credibility of his leadership; they, indeed,
called him "Mahatma", gave him confidence in his mission, lent him in any possible
way their support. Therefore, to take but one example, merely by his hunger strike the
Mahatma could control the behaviour of millions of people. But alas, this process
cannot work outside India, in countries where the common man does not have the
required level of sensitivity to his own unconscious. This is why Gandhi's schemes of
peaceful revolution has not yet been implemented anywhere else in the world. Other
countries could, possibly have their own Gandhi. But would these lone voices be heard,
let alone listened to and obeyed ?
Even in India the elite of the country, the clever people, missed the best part of
Gandhi's teachings. They have largely borrowed the western ways of the westem power
they were supposed to have expelled and, in this respect, remained colonized. Perhaps
this has been Gandhi's greatest shortcoming. He could transform a country but he
could not transform men. He could bring political freedom but not the freedom from
conditionings and ego. In other words, he could not raise Kundalinis.
Well, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi can! This is why the spiritual revolution She has
triggered with Sahaja Yoga is simply the most practical, the most effective revolution
of all times. As Shri Mataji can transform the basic cell of society, man, transform him,
that is, into a higher being, the gradual impact of this positive transformation will be felt
in all the dimensions of society. As this transformation will be duiy opposed, there will
be crises and clashes; the earth may shiver, the seas may rise. But the outcome can

be predicted with the kind of quiet certainty which distinguishes Nature's doings. At
the given time some eggs become chicken, some flowers turn into fruits, some people
become Sahaja Yogis. Like Gandhi we should be collective and wish this new freedom
for
many, many more. And we should be confident about it. For not only is nature doing
the job, She has even taken an incarnated form to explain us how She does it ! Really
we can only wish to Gandhiji to be back as one of us...
