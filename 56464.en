Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - Now see Doctor saab] these people call it migraine. It's something so much miraculous trouble called migraine and migraine can be with two problems. One, either the stomach or the brain; It cannot be third problem, so because you see, we call it the Vishnu tatwa, the evolving force, you see, is in the brain

Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - Just move forward] which gives us the awareness. [HINDI - No, no this portion you keep like this. Come back a little, yes. Now keep] [HINDI - both hands in front, yes sit like this. Yes, Now], what happens, that there is a principle of evolution within us.

The principle evolution starts from the stomach. We start evolving when we feel hungry to begin with. Then we start growing in that principle; Our awareness starts improving so that our brain also develops. According to Sahaja yoga, according to Sahaja yog - I don't know, if Medical Science would accept or not - but according to Sahaja yog the fat of the stomach is converted into brain cells by the aortic plexus - not actually aortic plexus by Swadhishthan Chakra - which is used by the brain because brain is using it's energy all the time and it has to be replaced, so these special cells come from the stomach. So, there are only two things that can give you a headache - one is of the brain or the stomach. Now, the stomach problem could be the liver. See, liver is something we do not understand much because liver is supposed to be a very secretive stuff but for Sahaja Yoga liver is very simple. Liver is caused because of too much thinking, because of too much of attention outside because when you start thinking too much, then the same cells which are required for the brain which are to be produced by one center, has to look after the brain and then, it neglects other organs like liver, like spleen, like pancreas, like kidneys so, such a person can get a high blood pressure, can get diabetes, can get troubles with the, say, with the spleen or other troubles that are caused by being, even leukemia it can [UNCLEAR - COPE TO?]. Then, with the pancreas you can get diabetes - like that - so, because that is neglected, the balance has to be brought in and such a person has to be brought to the balanced state. Such a person, who thinks too much, is, we call him as a right-sided man and a right-sided man must be brought to the left side a little bit.

So what we do, you see, if you are too right-sided, your left side is neglected - emotionally you become dry or frozen and the left side becomes over-excited - it requires more sustenance, so what we do, is to raise your left side, like this for all this and ultimately the heart because heart is also neglected because ego is created too much and it engulfs the heart and that's how people get heart troubles because your attention is outside, in the heart resides the Spirit - you don't pay any attention to your Spirit, so the heart also collapses; It is so simple as that. At the root point, I'm saying, so what you have to do, is to put left to the right or under all these circumstances when you suffer from the right side activity. So, what you do, is to put your left hand like this and put it up like that and bring it down right. Those who have got, not all, not all. Those who have got right-sided problem must - high blood pressure or diabetes have to do like this. Say about, those who have to do intensively should do 108 times. Just like this, if you think too much, like this 108 times. So, your thinking will be first reduced. First you have to come to balance. Now the balance also about dharma, if you start thinking too much, then you also are imbalanced.

Dharma is to be established within yourself. This is only possible in Sahaja Yoga, when you get your realization, when your Prana pratishtha is done, then you try to try to balance yourself and then the ascent is better, so the central path of Sushumna, which is actually expressed as Para Sympathetic, becomes wider and the Kundalini rises better and you are stabilized in Sahaj yoga. So, you start from the left hand side. Now, raise it up and put it on your head and put it down. Again you raise it, so you give yourself a balance. Again you raise it up - at least three times. Three times [MARATHI]. Three times, seven times or twenty-one times, fifty-one times and 108 times, depending on the intensity of the trouble. Now, if your attention is not on the Spirit and outside too much, then the Spirit recedes back. When it recedes back, you get heart attack.

All heart troubles are caused because of that. Now supposing a child [MARATHI] then the parents [MARATHI] [MARATHI] [MARATHI] futuristic, very futuristic. [HINDI - The whole day and night do you think only this,] [HINDI - 'What should we cook today, what should we cook tomorrow? What to cook in the evening?'] [HINDI - The children get troubles because of this.]

SY: [MARATHI]

Shri Mataji: [MARATHI] [MARATHI] [MARATHI] [MARATHI] [MARATHI] And also it goes, it is, these diseases are mostly found in the people, who are in certain communities, you see, those who have such ideas. In India also you'll find people, who are very futuristic, extremely futuristic, you see, specially in Punjab - extremely futuristic - materialistic and futuristic; Such people get heart attacks. Heart is first because their attention is not on the Spirit. [HINDI - Did you understand?] Now, those people are, who are too much crying type, weeping type, thinking of the past, ritualistic - they get the left side problems.

Left side problems are that you get possessed, all types of things happen to you and also, those who are very futuristic, people also, if somehow or the other, they get to people, who are dealing with the left side black magic or whatever it is, they can get into troubles like, leukemia or they're triggered - they're triggered into this. I saw a very nice program from BBC - the doctors did it - very wonderful program, I should say and they said that, "In our being there is an area built-in since our creation," and that is, of course, according to us is Collective Subconscious - alright? "So, from that area an attack comes by some proteins;" They call it Protein 52, 58 - name anything - I mean, you could call it by any name, "and these attack. Once they attack then the cancer is triggered." Very near our point is that we call them the spirits and they call them Protein 58. Whatever you call them but we call them spirits. Even virus infection is from the, from such vegetables which have gone out of the circulation of evolution. Even these things like leukemia and cancer and all these diseases are triggered by these dead spirits you can call them or dead things, which have gone out of the circulation of evolution because, if you start moving towards the left too much, you are very emotional type, you cry and weep too much and all that, you move that side. Once you start moving that side, you become aware of the Collective Subconscious, then they attack you. If you are very ambitious and all that, you can go to the right side too much and then you can become like Hitler.

For example, what Hitler did, that he created an atmosphere of Collective Supra Conscious - charged them with great ambitions and future and then attacked them and these people could not even think what they were doing, you see, the way they behaved and killed people. So, there are two types of people in this world basically - one who are left-sided, one who are right-sided. So, in Sanskrit language they are called as Tamogunis and Rajogunis. The central ones are the Satwagunis - the one who keep the balance. Balancing people are Satwagunis - not those who eat vegetables. This is a wrong idea people have that, if you eat vegetable, you become Satwaguni. You have seen we have communities, who are just, don't even eat garlic but they are extremely aggressive people; So, is not true - is the balance of the temperament that is important. Balance of the temperament, balance in life - a person who leads a balanced life, is really a dharmic person. The one who's an extremist, for example, some people who are very radical or they are fanatic and they believe into one idea that, "This is the truth, this is the truth," you see, such people become extremely charged and they can be very much in imbalance and if they ever are triggered by the left side Proteins 58 and 52, then they can catch cancer. So, fanaticism is also against nature - any extreme behavior or extreme belief.

Now, many people say, "Mother, but it is written in this book, written in that book." Alright, so, so many things are written in these books but we have seen it doesn't do any good. What does, what is the thing you should expect in life is, what happens to you really, what do you achieve out of it, not what your mental projection is. Now you believe that, this pole is the tree. Supposing you believe in it. Who can tell you it is not, unless and until you see yourself. If you believe into something just by mental projection, then you cannot reach the truth. You have to keep yourself open and see for yourself because beyond this mind, beyond this mind, is the realm of Eternity because this mind is limited. This is a limited mind and this mind, if it has to go to unlimited, you have to go beyond that. How do you go?

By thinking about it, again you are in the same bondage. With the bondage you cannot go, so the bondage has to be broken, something has to trigger it and for that triggering, God has given you this great thing called Kundalini. She's within you, within all of you and you all have to take advantage of it. There is nothing like believing in Sahaja Yoga because it's all mental projection. Don't believe in anything, first of all. First of all, you get to your Spirit. Then Spirit is Absolute. Then the Spirit tells you what to believe in because you start feeling the cool breeze in the hand with that. Now, for example, our doctor was there yesterday - she immediately started feeling the different centers - immediately, because you just Absolute. You don't say anything, nothing.

You don't have to say, it just works out. If you say, "Oh, this is burning." It just works out and if this works out, what does that mean. If this works out, what does that mean? That is the only thing I have to do is to decode it and you have to understand after I have decoded it, how to cure - is as simple as that. In Sahaja yoga there's no aggression and there's no regression. You are just standing on reality. To see thing how it works out and how it is going to help humanity.

Shri Mataji:[IN HINDI - You are alright now, get up. How are you feeling?]

SY: [IN HINDI - I am able to get up now]

Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - Can get up now - it's started.] You just see his left nabhi. [IN HINDI - Where is your wife?]

SY: [IN HINDI: She's not there.]

Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI -When did she die?]

SY: [IN HINDI - She's not dead.]

Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - Then where is she?]

SY: [IN HINDI - She's left.]

Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - That's the problem] Now this nobody can believe [UNCLEAR] that his wife has gone away that's why he's suffering from the Left Nabhi because Left Nabhi - this is Left Nabhi and Left Nabhi is here. Is the place of the Grihalaxmi, is the woman of the house.

If your Gruhalaxmi is not respectable, you might get it or if she is not respected also you'll get it. She must be respectable and is to be respected. Specially in India most of them get this because we don't respect our Gruhalaxmis so much while in England people get it right because women don't respect their husbands. It's a question of imbalance. The women have to be respectable and men have to respect them. [IN SANSKRIT - Yatra narya poojyante, tatra ramante devta] The women if they are respected and if they are not respectable, they are no use. So you have to be respectable and you are to be respected. [IN HINDI - And this is left nabhi, you got it from your wife. What is your wife's name?]

SY: [HINDI - In English, She's called Tricoza but in Hebrew she's called Tofaha]

Shri Mataji: Tofaha?

SY: Tofaha.

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then what's she, Jew?]

SY: [HINDI - She's Jew]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Now your leg is okay.You can walk straight.]

SY: Hmm

Shri Mataji: Thinking her name also. [HINDI - Then where has she gone? Has she gone to Israel?

SY: [HINDI - No, she's here only. She married someone else.]

Shri Mataji: Annh?

SY: [HINDI - She's here only - married someone else]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then leave such a woman]

SY: [HINDI - Have left her. 20 years have passed at least - 22 years]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - And children?]

SY: England

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Now it has started happening in India also.] [HINDI - Your leg is alright now. Lift it, raise it above. See, you are alright now? You are alright now. Now leave her] [MARATHI] [HINDI - Okay, now you.] [HINDI - Is your hand shaking now, see? See which finger of yours? No, keep hand like this.]

[HINDI - It's not any such thing. It's obvious. You have got nervous trouble, nervous trouble is there.] [HINDI - In nervous trouble, see your left side is shaking more. We have to rectify that first] [HINDI - On the ground. Bow to Mother Earth first and keep your hand on it] She will suck your problem. [HINDI - All problems of the nerves are sucked by Mother Earth. Yesterday there was a man - he has gone?] [HINDI - His hands were shaking a lot. He just put one hand towards Me and put] [HINDI - one hand on the Mother Earth.

Keep like this, on the ground. No, no on the ground outside] [HINDI - You come from the front. On the open ground, yes, it's alright] [MARATHI] [HINDI - Yes, brother keep this hand towards Me. Yes, now see. The ground that is,] [HINDI - you have respected it. Do you believe in this Holy land?]

SY: [HINDI - Yes, I believe]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - India is a very big, pure,] [HINDI - holy land. Okay. so what have you done for this holy land. What have you done for your country?]

[HINDI - What have you done for this India?]

SY: [HINDI - Actually, I was in service with [HINDI - the Government of India, after that I did some business but actually, for the] [HINDI - Mother Earth, I have done nothing.]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Okay you were in the Government of India?]

SY: [HINDI - Yes]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - So you've done that,] [HINDI - that is enough. Government of India is also made of this Mother Earth only] [HINDI - Everything is made from this earth only. We have no right on the sky,] SY: [HINDI - Yes, please]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - it's only on the Earth that we have a right] [HINDI - So, in which department were you?] SY: [HINDI - I was in the Railways.]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - What?]

SY: Railway department.

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Actually, the government servants work more than required] [HINDI - and, I don't mean that you don't do, you should work.

It's very important to work [HINDI - but they don't look after their wife and children. Isn't it right? ] [HINDI - They neglect their household and thus they don't look after their emotional side, isn't it?]

SY: [HINDI - Emotional [UNCLEAR] not much]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then you have to be emotional.] [HINDI - When you do government job, do it emotionally with the thought that you are] [HINDI - serving your mother. If you do like this, you will never have any problem] [HINDI - But if you work with the thought that you are developing it, you are developing] [HINDI - the country or I am serving the Railways, then there's an issue.] [HINDI - I am serving my country, Mother India, if you do your government job with this feeling,] [HINDI - then the effect will not be so much. You should be attached emotionally.]

SY: [HINDI - Would like to tell You this also, that after service of 25 years and leaving it] SY: [HINDI - I did poultry farming for 20 years, here in Poona. 20 years poultry farming,]

SY: [HINDI - poultry breeding, and in that I can say that I served Mother Earth little bit]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Served or gained out of it?]

SY: [HINDI - Gained also a lot, gained a lot]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - So, this give and take of the Mother Earth remains] [HINDI - How much we gain from it, we should give back. You should decide in your life] [HINDI - that you have done a lot. Now I will do something for India too, for the world also.] [HINDI - We all always think about ourselves only - isn't it?]

SY: [HINDI - Yes, but since the last 2 years, I'm totally retired. Now I'm doing nothing.]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - No, then you do something. Now you do Sahaja yog and serve God for sometime]

SY: [HINDI - Thinking of serving God]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Will you do? Then it's okay] [HINDI - You serve God, every problem will go away. Okay?]

Just take him out and put him left to the right and he has a heart. Just, please. [HINDI - Take him inside.] [HINDI - Sahaja yogis will see you. It's alright, they'll see you - make you feel lighter.] [HINDI - Get up, please. Get up slowly, they'll see you] [MARATHI]

SY: [MARATHI]

Shri Mataji: [MARATHI] [MARATHI] [MARATHI] [MARATHI] [HINDI - Should be. You Gujaratis, have you become English? Annh?. You should learn to] [HINDI - live in the Indian style, properly.

Indians have become very English] [MARATHI] [HINDI - Live like Indians. Whichever country you belong to, you should live like that only] [HINDI - Shouldn't uproot. English become Indians, no use. Can you grow] [HINDI - any other fruit from mango. Only mango will grow out of mango tree.] [HINDI - Whichever country you belong to, live like that only. God has made a variety] [HINDI - of people, different types of faces, different types of [UNCLEAR], in that] [HINDI - why do you want to change that variety? Everything different looks beautiful] [HINDI - If everybody looks the same, it will appear like military people coming forward] [HINDI - Isn't it, just tell? There'll be no fun in life. Various types of people should be there] [HINDI - and Gujaratis are turning very English.

And in London I'm seeing them] [HINDI - Making themselves very peculiar. No need to become English. Live like Indians] [HINDI - We are Indians, live like Indians - understood? We should live like Indians] [HINDI - No need to live in English style. Let English people live in their style] [HINDI - Let Indians live in Indian style, let Chinese live in Chinese style.] [HINDI - What's the use. Wherever a dress is made, for that dress whatever suits,] [HINDI - whatever is beneficial, wear that. In our country those dresses come and] [HINDI - finish off very soon. They do come but do not stay because they are not suitable here] [HINDI - in the heat. If we ask for those warm dresses from there, they go waste] [HINDI - as people can't use them and discard them.

How many days will they last,] [HINDI - you only tell Me. Here only kurta pyjama will only suit and if you wear suit etc] [HINDI - you'll feel uneasy due to the heat. Doesn't it happen? Either they have to make in cotton.] [HINDI - Can't wear warm clothes. Thus the traditional dresses made here for us] [HINDI - which are useful for us, should be worn. And if possible, we should wear dresses] [HINDI - of our country, no need to follow any one else, no need to uproot yourself] [HINDI - It's useless. Is it alright now?]

SYogi: All those who have diabetes, please come up.

SYogi: [HINDI - People with diabetes, please stand up. People with diabetes.]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Sit down comfortably] [HINDI - Okay, now all people keep hand here (Left upper abdomen), those who have sugar trouble] [HINDI - here, here, this place left side, no, this place left side, no this side] [HINDI - like this, yes this side - where we have our spleen, that place and keep the left hand towards Me, right] [MARATHI] Let him come here. Ravi, you come this side, come along.

You three forgive everyone] [HINDI - All those with diabetes, should forgive everyone. People with paralysis, forgive everyone] [HINDI - People with heart trouble, forgive everyone - are you listening? Forgive everyone] [HINDI - Hmm, you are benefiting, isn't it? Forgive, say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."] SYogi: [HINDI - Forgive with a true heart.]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - With pure heart, this is correct] [HINDI - You should forgive with a true heart. See how much you'll be at ease, entirely peaceful] [HINDI - You say, "Mother, I forgive everyone," you'll be very relieved. Are you feeling good?] [MARATHI] Left Nabhi [HINDI - Hmm, is your relation to your husband okay?

SY: Yes

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Where is your husband, where?

Is she okay with you? Annh?] [HINDI - Or you both keep fighting?]

Then become a Vaishnav.] [HINDI - What is being a Vaishnav? Vaishnav means, being an evolved soul] [HINDI - (ATTHA CHAAP?)

You belong to them only, isn't it? Hmm, Vallabhacharya did it.] [HINDI - Nobody knows him now it seems. Vaishnavas have taken themselves where nobody knows] [HINDI - He was a a very great evolved soul. People can be realized only by taking his name] [HINDI - You should not have had diabetes. Yes, did you feel cool in the hand?]

SYogi: [HINDI - Did you feel any coolness in your hand?]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Only by taking his name, I told you, he was a very, great person.] [HINDI - Vallabhacharya was a very great man, who started this sect and this Vishnu path(way), which is for evolution.] [HINDI - He gave such a big name, started such a great work, wrote down so much but that had no effect.]

[MARATHI] [HINDI - Are you getting some thing cool in your hands? It's enough] [HINDI - Are you also Vaishnav?]

SY: Jain

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then what?]

SY: Jain

Shri Mataji: Jain

SYogi: [HINDI - That's why there's a catch] [HINDI - Now who has understood Mahavira? No body understood] [HINDI - Mahavira never asked to make temples, did He ever say? He never said] [HINDI - He only said to meditate and be one with God. This is what He said, isn't it?] [HINDI - He never asked to make temples. All Jainis are only making temples.] [HINDI - Make yourself into temples.

So many temples these Jainis have built and all sorts of work they do there] [HINDI - Putting such absurd statues in Jain temples. In such beautiful places,] [HINDI - these Jainis put such dirty(obscene) statues. Did Mahavira say such a thing?] [HINDI - He never said such a thing. So pure, such an evolved soul on coming to this world] [HINDI - what have we done to Him.] [HINDI - Son keep your right hand on the ground, right hand. Left hand towards Me] [HINDI - Hold My foot from below with your right hand. Is it slightly better?] [HINDI - Has the palpitation reduced little bit? Is it happening?]

SY: [HINDI - Little bit]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - It's reduced, isn't it?] [HINDI - Brother are you feeling cool breeze? Not coming. Okay, now you forgive everyone] [HINDI - First forgive the army people as you are in the army, forgive the army men first.]

SYogi: [HINDI - No, he's not in the army, Mother]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then in what is he?]

SYogi: [HINDI - He's a civilian, a contractor]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - He's a contractor?]

SYogi: [HINDI - Yes]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then whom should I say are those he should forgive?]

SYogi: [HINDI - He should forgive everyone]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Forgive all government employees then] [HINDI - Who troubles the contractors?]

SYogi: [HINDI - All those only trouble]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Forgive the government servants] [HINDI - See you are benefiting from it. Forgive all those who have troubled you.]

[HINDI - No, I thought he's wearing khaki clothes, so I thought of saying military] [HINDI - Are you okay? Feeling good? Now put your right hand towards Me, like this] [HINDI - Now see, it will be a little hot. It is hot? Will cool down. And you son?] [HINDI - Are you benefiting? Is the palpitation reduced somewhat from before?] [HINDI - Is her valve absent? What do the doctors say?]

SY: [HINDI - The valve is to be replaced]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Valve is to be replaced. Did you bring the prescription?] [HINDI - Child, you catch hold of My feet. Doctor, just see what it is.] [HINDI - Now in your heart you say, "I am the Spirit."]

Shri Mataji: [MARATHI] [HINDI - Where has My handkerchief fallen?]

Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

Shri Mataji: [CONVERSATION IN MARATHI]

Shri Mataji: [CONVERSATION IN MARATHI]

Shri Mataji: [CONVERSATION IN MARATHI] Dry ginger powder and sugar to be taken early in the morning during winter time, to be taken by this kind of migraine. It is due to liver problems. You feel [HINDI - like we say, nauseated] you feel that [UNCLEAR], feel like vomiting and you, you don't like the Sun and you get headache - all this is a sign of a bad liver. We have two types of livers. One is a liver [ASIDE - MARATHI] One - one liver which is the thought and one liver we call it as the cold liver - two types. That means, a liver that is sluggish and liver over active.

The person who has a very over-active liver, will be a thin person. The one who has a sluggish, will be a person with a bigger body. The one who has got very active liver, will have this kind of problems. He'll think too much, he'll vomit - we have many here[LAUGHS] and he'll vomit and he will also do, sort of, over-activity, you see, and he can't bear the Sun - all these things. Anything fried such a person eats or anything, he gets into vomit. The other is the sluggish one. In the sluggish one, you get allergies, allergies are with that kind of, which is a sluggish one. So that's how we have two types of livers. For the first one, you have to give for the first one, you have to give, what you call this ... [HINDI - dry ginger powder] and sugar or during winter time and summer time you have to give kokum water with sugar but lot of sugar is needed for such a person and for the left side - sugar sustains the attention. Generally, we doctors say that don't take sugar - is not possible.

For the right-sided person, sugar is very essential, the left-sided person - salt. Now for the left-sided person, you have to give something like geru, which is a Calcium in a very fine form, and it's a geru. Is very good to apply, if they do not get rid of their allergies, to have some in, to get rid of your allergies with Calcium but in childhood, if the children are giver Calcinol or Calcium something, and Vitamin A and D from the age of say, 8 years to 12 years, you'll seldom, you'll not get this allergic conditions. These allergic conditions only come in because you do not have sufficient Calcium but after 12 years or 14 years, you can't take much Calcium, you see. So the Calcium if it is given - not injections but something that you eat in Calcium form in milk - but milk is sometimes not sufficient, so give something - I think this Calcinol children like very much, so best is to give all of them Calcium. I told, I mean when I went to Japan, I told people, why don't you take to Calcium? I was surprised, they are, now see how Japanese have grown in heights, you get height and you develop a balance.

SYogi: This boy is light now, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Are you feeling the cool breeze in both the hands? Good.

Now which one is another diabetic patient?

SYogi: Diabetes - any diabetic patient?

[HINDI - Yes, keep your hands open] so that you get more vibrations, alright? [HINDI -This is Chaitanya Lehri] You've read Swananda lehri, Chaitanya Lehri, have you read Saundarya Lehri - these are the books you should read, alright? We should not create Shabd-jalam.

SY: Shri Aurobindo

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

SY: Shri Aurobindo

Shri Mataji: No, no, no that's all shabd jalam again.

Shri Aurobindo - just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk - alright? That makes you mad. That's why Kabira has said, [Hindi - 'Padhi, Padhi pandit moorakh bhayo']. I didn't understand what he meant at that time but I've seen now, people who read too much, it all goes into your head and they're all inside, you're outside, you're nowhere. Too much reading isn't [UNCLEAR - USEFUL?]

SY: [HINDI - I will serve Mother]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - I don't need any service] [HINDI - I'm, Myself, serving all the people, what is there to serve Me]

SY: [HINDI - Keep Mother in my heart]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - I don't need anything My child but will you serve others, is the point] [HINDI - Will you serve others?]

SYogini: [HINDI - I do]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - No. you are worrying for him. Nothing to worry.] [HINDI - I'm seeing/taking care of him. Don't worry for him. My foot is on his back only.] [HINDI - Okay, you get your realization.

Hmm. You? Just worried for the child.] [HINDI - First get your realization so that you don't ever get sick, child will also not be sick] [HINDI - You can cure the child also. You have only one child, I have thousands.] [HINDI - For who all to worry, tell? For one child you all are so concerned,] [HINDI - worry about the One who has thousands. Leave it. The child will be completely well.] [HINDI - Leave the concern absolutely.

The child will be cured, taken up for that only, yes] [HINDI - You should be able to give up also. Till you keep holding on, the work will not be done] [HINDI - Do you know the tale of Draupadi? Draupadi's tale is such] [HINDI - that when the Pandavas lost her and when she saw that now her chastity is at risk] [HINDI - when they started pulling her sari, then she held her sari by her teeth, saying 'Kri'] [HINDI - Why didn't she say, 'shna' because she thought that the end of her sari would slip] [HINDI - so she kept on holding between her teeth at 'Kri'. Till she] [HINDI - kept on holding at 'Kri' till then, Krishna was sitting comfortably. As soon as] [HINDI - she left her sari and said, 'shna', then 'Shankh, chakra, gada, padma, garuda, lei sidhare'] [HINDI - At the moment she said 'shna', then [HINDI - 'Dwarika mein shor bhayo, shor bhayo bhari, Shankh, chakra, gada, padma, garud lei sidhari'] [HINDI - So, you should be able to leave or give up also.

SYogi: [HINDI - Child what's happened to you?]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - I'll see her just now. Keep your hand on her heart, right hand] [HINDI - How are you?] Better now?

SYogi: This is Fazalbai.

Shri Mataji: Let Me have [MARATHI]. See on your face is less now.

Yes, ask him. Where is your husband? Just see on your hand. Less now and the nose is much less. [MARATHI]

SYogi: [HINDI - This Fazalbai is a prominent person from Maharashtra]

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - What?]

SYogi: [HINDI - Mr. Fazalbhai, who has come

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - I know him very well.] Mr. Fazalbhai, do you remember Me? No. I came to you for yoga and wanted to do a lot. Nothing was done.

Now I would request you to do something about it. Alright? You have to organize something, isn't it?

SYogi: He's one of the sahaja yogis.

Shri Mataji: I know he's also. You see, he knows Me very well, Mr. Fazalbhai and who told Me was this gentleman from Singapore. [HINDI - What's his name - Salilbhoy.] He asked Me to see you but he's so much possessed by so many other people. You see, all the rich people are always invaded by people who want money and somehow or other, they think, he's so much invaded by people impossible. I don't want any money, you know that very well but we have to organize it in a way where you don't need money, don't need money much, but this now, see how Ahuja has arranged.

We have paid for everything, he's not paid for anything you can ask. We have not, he's not paid for [HINDI - Did you pay for anything ever? We never took any money from you]

SYogi: [HINDI - No]

Shri Mataji: Never but only thing, we all have to organize it properly, which was not done. You have to organize it. You are such a well-known person in yoga - this is real yoga, alright? Please try to help Me. Actually, we don't need any money - nothing - but organize it. Now, somebody has given Me a very beautiful land in Powai, absolutely free - can you imagine - because I was insisting that, "I will not take anything with black money," so somebody very kindly, has donated Me a free land - not to Me but to this organization. As it is we have no organization, it's a living organization but we had to have a Trustee, so we had some trustees and by God's Grace, I'm sure, we'll be able to build something here but you have to talk to people about it, you have to bring them out. He has done it.

You see, I cured his heart, alright - I cured the heart of so many people who have... but I must say, it's special about him. The way he took it up upon himself. You are so influential, you can do a lot, alright? Please try because this is the only way you can help others in the genuine way. All other organizations of helping, is very superficial. So I have to request you, God has put you in that position to do His job, alright. You are specially posted.

SYogi: Now he's always forward,

Shri Mataji: He's very good but [HINDI - the thing is]

SYogi: he's never behind, he's always forward

Shri Mataji: [HINDI - but what happens] wrong type of people always grab these things [HINDI - doesn't it happen, it happened to you also] [HINDI - and we should take the genuine and it should be given to those who deserve it] [HINDI - If you had not organized it here] I mean, I would have done it - I'm doing already for thousands of people in the villages but say Poona city, I would say, you have done a good thing for Poona city. In the same way, he can do a lot in Bombay, I tell you - Mr. Fazalbhai can. I've met him thrice.

You're better. [HINDI - Aren't you? Come here behind] Now you see this Dhumaal. He's just a ordinary, we should say, a farmer and he has given realization to ten thousand people and cured, I don't now, how many. So many have been cured but curing is not the main thing. It's first to get to God. That's what Zoraster has said that, "You have to become." Becoming is the point. We have one very great Parsi doctor here. I don't know if you have met him.

Where is Rustom? Rustom Burgorjee

SY: He's inside

SYogi: He's attending to some patient

Shri Mataji: He's gone out somewhere. You must meet him. He's a Psychiatrist, he's also a doctor who, he's the consultant in London, very big hospital, St. Thomas' Hospital and he's working it very well. This is absolutely genuine. There's no question of money or anything What money can one pay for God's love - isn't it? Very simple. Now this is extremely simple thing I gave you vibrated. Now you put it in a katori(bowl) or something and put some water. It will never be spoilt.

All the time you can use it as a cream. Always whenever you want, you can put some water but don't use soap at all. Just put this, leave it there and wash it off. The whole thing will come out and also good for your liver, you can put it on your liver, little bit and then take it out. It will take out your heat. But I would like you to take some sugar vibrated also, which you both should take because both have liver problems and it will help you. Ask them to put their hands on the liver, both of them - the right hand towards Me. [HINDI - Are you alright?] SY: [HINDI - Anything doesn't come]
