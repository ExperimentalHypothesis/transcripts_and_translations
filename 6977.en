Complete your Self-realisation, Puja in Aurangabad (India), 19 December 1987.

I am sorry, I was dealing with some newspaper people, journalists, and they came very late, whatever it is.

I found them to be very sensible and very understanding. All of us have come to Aurangabad now, and it seems this place is full of vibrations. Maybe here Shalivahana has ruled in this area, but also there have been many saints who were born on this side of Maharashtra, and they perpetuated Dharma. They always talked about self-realization. Dharma gives you the balance. It gives you the establishment into proper behaviour, proper understanding, proper living, but it doesn’t give you the completion of your journey. It doesn’t give you the satisfaction of reaching the destination. And your personality is still incomplete. So, one has to have the experience of the spirit. As I was discussing with them today, I told them that those who do not have ... the experience of the spirit ... are not only incomplete, but are limited people.

So, whatever they see, or whatever they know, or whatever they criticize, is limited. As in English we say that “hate the sin and not the sinner”. Like many people who find something wrong with Christianity start blaming Christ. Christ did not created Christianity, first of all. He did not create Christianity. He did not create Christians. So, there is no relationship between the two. As you know, recently, they have found out the books written by Thomas, the disciple of Christ who was coming to India.* On his way he went to Egypt, and there he wrote these treatises and had put them in a big earthen vessel, or perhaps it was a metallic thing, and it was discovered forty-two years back. The people ... whom he considers to be ... authorized Christians, he calls them as Gnostic.

“Gne”, “gne” in Sanskrit language means, “to know”. “Gne” means “to know”. And he has written that to know, and to have the personal experience is the only way to follow Christ. Clearly. Not only that, it’s said that God Almighty who is so kind, why will He ask you to suffer? So, it challenges all the Christian principles of suffering. In the same way, in all religions, people have diverted from the right path, and have come to the wrong path, and are indulging into self-created religions, which has no relationship with reality, or with the incarnations, those who started those religions or who gave the ideas of the religion. I hope you won’t do that to Me, because you are gnostic people. You are the ones who know, who have had self-realization. Without self-realization you cannot have a complete personality.

But as you see in Sahaja Yoga, you don’t have to go to Himalayas, to give up your families; you don’t have to be away from the society to get your realization. You get your realization in the circumstances where you are born. In the same society, in the same family-life. But you rise higher than them, and try to pull them out of the mire in which they are existing. This mire of ignorance has to be crossed, and some of you have to do it. And when you realize that, then you should know that you all have to be very strong people. You all have to be extremely strong. If you are not strong enough, how can you pull out the rest of them? People who are mediocre think that gradually they’ll be alright, and that they’ll come up. But I would suggest that you should make all-out-effort to become strong Sahaja Yogis.

To become strong Sahaja Yogis is not difficult. Because you have all the powers within yourselves. You have the Kundalini within yourselves. And you know the way, how to become a realized soul. The problems are of you being dragged into your ego or into your conditioning. Only two problems, not more. Like somebody asked, “How many turns there are in London?” Only two, left or right. So, either you go to the left or to the right. All the permutations and combinations of this left and right starts working and then you get into trouble.

And then you get into problems. But actually, it is a very simple thing. To get out of your ego should be the simplest and that is where you try to understand yourself. You see yourself. How you are reacting. Where is your attention? What are you doing? What is your attitude towards Sahaja Yoga? So many people think that “this is my house, this is my family, this is my car, this is my horse, this is my dog. I don’t know how far it goes – “my, my, my, my, my”.

But nothing is yours. Yesterday, as Kabira has said it, that “some cheat”, that is the death, “will come and take away everything that is not yours”. Then “my family” ... then “my children” ... All this is a nonsense, and so, when you start getting attached to this word “my”, there where you fail completely into your own understanding of your ego, you’re completely blinded by this ego. First of all, you should say that “nothing is mine”. Kabira has said that when the goat is living, she goes on saying “Mei, mei, mei ...” means “I, I, I ...” in Hindi language. Made a pun on the word “my”. And when she dies, and her intestines are taken out, and are made into something that spins the ... cotton, they go on the street, these people, telling people that they are around, they go on playing on that string which is made from the intestines of these goats, it says, “Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi ...” meaning “You are, you are, you are ...” So, one need not be like a goat, that till you leave you go on saying “I, I, my, my ...” When you die then your intestines have to be taken out and put on that thing just to make the sound “Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi ...” So, this sound of “I, I, I ...” is made only by egoistical human beings, but this ego is so much identified with you, that you think that “I am this ego and ego is me”. And in that ego, you start doing all kinds of nonsensical things. This ego takes you nowhere, it takes you nowhere but into a complete mire of ignorance about yourself. Ultimately you become stupid, others can tell you that you are stupid, or you become idiotic, or you get a bad name, and everybody knows that you are doing all wrong things, but nobody there tell you, because you are to be reached with a barge pole.

Such a hot-tempered personality you become, nobody dare come you and say that this is wrong, it should not be done, it’s stupid, idiotic, and you, yourself, in that idiocy and stupidity think no end of yourself. This is the extreme of your ego. But it’s nice, we have people like Hitler to see. So, if you put Hitler as the ideal egoist then you will not go on that road. Because it’s a very slippery road and maybe one day you land up there. The second side of ours, which is a very, looks very morbid and very mild, is the left side. The movement on the left side is the emotional side. You develop habits with the left side. Now, some people have very dangerous habits, some have simple habits. Like I have a bad habit, or a good habit, you may say, that I must put my right hand under my foot, because it’s all the time working, so I want to control it.

So, I put it under my head like this, while sleeping and sometimes under my foot, just to make it little bit stop working, it works too hard. Just to give it rest. So, under my pillow I put it and sleep. But I discovered once, I hurt myself, that I now cannot put it under my head. I said, “It’s a very funny habit I have got.” But it’s not such a dangerous one. It’s quite good. So, I am continuing with it. But I can get rid of it. It’s very simple.

But when I get rid of it, I think the people become overactive so I put it again, under my pillow. So as Sahaja Yogis all your habits should be under your control. Now the ... habits we have formed through drugs, from drinking, from anything, are very dangerous habits. Also, people have their attention being all the time around. All the time is attention here, there and there, attracting people, looking after them, not looking after yourself. This attention has to be brought under control. Is very important. That’s very simple, that whenever it happens, you just put down your eyes. Keep your eyes down. That’s one of the ways we ... allow our attention to fritter away, and also our growth becomes stunted.

This is a very very dangerous thing which in the West specially we have developed. Here, also, people must read every shop’s name. Indians have a bad habit, because they have just now started reading, so they want to read everything that they find, anything. So, on the road if there is a road of shops, they read every name of every shop, turn around again and see if they have missed anything. It sounds stupid. But they all do it. And all the time they are doing it. So, the attention, wherever it goes, has to be under our control. We have to keep it, all the time under our control. As Namadeva has said very clearly, in Guru Grant Sahib has written, that when a little child is flying the kite, he’s talking to everyone, he’s playing in a way, but his attention is on the kite.

And when a housewife is carrying her duties, putting her child on her waist and working, then she’s doing all kinds of work, but her attention is on the child. The Ladies who are carrying three-four earthen pots on their heads, water filled up to the brim, are walking, talking to each other, having mirth and enjoyment, but the attention is on the earthen pot, on their heads. In the same way, whatever adventure you are into, whatever you are doing, your attention should be on your spirit. Then everything is under control, and you can never get enveloped into anything where attention should not be lost. So, these two problems we have, and those problems even after realization people have it. So please try, when you are not meditating, to keep your attention on your spirit. Now, the person who is left-sided or right-sided, he has developed a mechanism within himself to justify himself. Through his intellect, or maybe if they are ladies, they have water power, they’ll start crying. And you just don’t know what to say to them. If you tell them anything, first thing they’ll do is to cry, means sometimes I feel there are thousand arrows on My head when they start crying.

It is impossible to say anything to them. And if you talk to some men they’ll give so many explanations that you would feel like, just, going off to sleep. It’s so boring. It’s easy to read some book like “War and Peace” than to listen to the arguments of such people. But they don’t want to see that this is all ego, which is talking, it is not, they are talking, it is not their spirit. And if the spirit has to evolve, we have to be extremely witnessing, in a full way, very alert, extremely alert and witnessing ourselves, what are we doing. Then only we reach the completion of our realization. Unless and until you reach the completion of your realization, you can never be masters of your attention, and you can never be the enjoyer of your joy, and you can never know the truth fully. Achieve this Sat-Chit-Ananda swarupa you have to be extremely careful about the instrument that God has given you, this body, mind and emotions. You have to keep them in check, because wherever your habits are, they can never be joy giving, it’s a joyless pursuit and wherever your ego is, it’s a destructive effort.

So, both things are detrimental to your growth, apart from that, they are extremely dangerous thing for yogis. So, as you are, in whatever conditions you are, in whatever situations you are, whatever may be the surroundings, like a dirty mire full of creatures and filth, you can become like lotuses. When you become like lotuses all that is filth, all that is horrible, can become fragrant. And this is what we have to achieve. When people will see the lotuses, they’ll come to you, not to see the worms and to see the filth, but to see the lotuses. So please, this time, correct yourself, you don’t need anybody to correct you, you just correct yourself, watch out for yourself, and see for yourself. If something doesn’t work out just give up. Don’t go to extremes for anything. Must learn to give up at a point and be happy about it.

If you are contained within yourself, if your hand is attached to your body, then you reach up to a point and then leave it, but if it is not attached, if it is disintegrated then it goes all round and round and round and comes back without anything. That understanding has to be there in you people because you’re standing in the central part, and you’re attached to the central part, not only, but you are identified with it. So, you cannot go too far to the left, cannot go too far to the right, if you do that you get lost. Then you are no more a Sahaja Yogi, and then no use having you here artificially or superficially because it will be hypocrisy. Whatever is needed to put you back into right frame you must accept. And whatever is needed to understand Sahaja Yoga you have to do. As I have said, please try to learn English language. I cannot learn fourteen languages. Very difficult. It’s surprising how I have learned this English language also.

So now to learn fourteen languages I’ve to take fourteen Avatars again. I don’t ask you to learn Marathi. Because that’s the best language for Me to speak. But at least try to learn English, and then we can see if you can learn Marathi or Hindi.

[Translation from Marathi to English]

What is to say now? That you are born in auspicious place. this auspicious place Aurangabad, I feel that’s very auspicious place. Great Saints are born here. Since thousands of years people worked and gave you these Punyas.

Because of those Punyas you are here today You behaved well, respected Dharmas but not yet reached the Completeness. Therefore, you took Self Realisation. After getting Self Realisation we should be able to see our defects. Otherwise you have not got that light yet. Now with the Foreigners they have other defects. and Indian people have another defects. And now I see those defects so prominently that I feel sometimes better I tell them very clearly. Actually for Indians my house my daughter, my grandson these things very much and they are so much involved in the family matters that they can not come out of it. I made 4-5 boys marriages and sent them to Austria. They had no jobs.

They got nice jobs there. Immediately they made their own houses or rather an Indian man can not live without home. Even having all the facilities in the Ashram they want their separate houses. Their wives get bored because to have separate house means to work on your own. There are no servants, no nothing. After having Delivery also they work on their own. Though they are pregnant they have to work on their own. Husbands will be enjoying outside. They will have Cars, have Television and then go everywhere. After coming home shout at wives, ‘You did not cook well, did not do that’.

Wives got bored. What kind of husbands are this? They can not work everything, can not clean outside. Only my house should be neat and clean and go out for scrolling. Everyone is the same here. Here Indian men can not work anything. They do not use their hands for Work. All are sophisticated. We have appointed a Gardner. Well, he is Gardner.

From Austria. He is also an agriculture adviser of U.N. He came here. He takes Spade and Scraper in hands and works so hard. Indian men with hands on Waist and wearing Gumboots. I asked,“ why did you wear Gumboots?“ I have Problems with mud. Is it so? Then you can go now and be royal. These things are very much in us. And speciality of Wives is that they know well that our husbands are in our control if the house is clean and if they get delicious food.

So today this delicious Dish, tommorrow another delicious Dish for husband. Then for the meal they give you what you like. So if you like bitter Gourds then bring the bitter Gourd at any cost from the Market. Then cook them for husband. All the time serve husband. Whole time after husband. First thing, due to this husbands get spoiled. And. Home is something special. is our thinking Our attention does not go beyond that.

That is my, mine. It becomes so narrow minded that we get destroyed in this. This should go away from us If you are Sahajyogis, became Yogis wherever they sit, it is your home, wherever you go it is your home. Do not ask, the family is small. How that smallness will become gross? You are born in Yogabhumi of India because of whatever Punyas you earned in past Births. But everything gets destroyed. That greatness should come. That greatness does not come and Some people even say it is very less in Men. Now, Now all have written that we like Indian women but not Indian Men.

Because all are lazy Lumps, we can see it. If there is dirt outside the house they will still walk on it. But women will keep the house clean. But women are clever. If the house is in order then husband stays at home. It is very difficult to keep him at home because he always remains out. Therefore we have the defect that we do not have collectiveness in us. How to become collective, how to be nice with one another, how to become compassionate we do not think this. Now with the great difficulties we opened an Ashram in Delhi. Nobody wants to stay there.

Somehow we sent one couple from Mumbai. Within 2 days returned back. The feeling like my home should be given up. The day when you will say that the whole world is my home then can be said that you have become great. The mind is so restricted. How Sahajayogis will do progress. Though they become Sahajayogis, even they meditate, do Pujas, everything is OK. It is past earnings. But as it is. No progress beyond that.

I have found reason for that is wasting time at home very much. If you move only in Circle how will you go further? We can not get in Collectivity. So much Selfcentreness. Increase only Self Esteem. My home, my wife, my children this and that. Until you do not come out of this it is only load of work. It is just a Donkey-work. If God is doing everything then why do you become Donkey? If you say you do everything then you became donkey Like Jesus was sitting on a Donkey and Donkey was carrying him.

That Donkey thought, it became Jesus because everyone was garlanding donkey. Then Donkey started troubling Jesus. So Jesus got down of donkey and went somewhere else. From other side came the Washerman, the master of donkey. He beated (slapped) donkey nicely. Then it realised that it itself is donkey and Jesus is Jesus. Likewise Yogi is Yogi. He is not donkey. Unnecessary donkey-work. To please wife, please this person, please that person.

There is no need. In collectivity One should get in collectivity. To get in collectivity first of all one should give up all these small small petty things. Small person sees everything small. Does not see anything gross. Whatever is small, which is false is always easily accepted. Therefore we have to make our mind great. First of all my house these Words should be given up. Mine, this word is false. What is there in mine?

Like yesterday it was said about Kabira that one theif came and robbed me. Means who? Death. The time when Death comes everything remains behind. Then my, mine everything is left behind. But this Death has come in us because we have become Sahajayogis now. Formerly we were Eggs and now we have become Birds. So everything from the past has been left behind. Now we have to spread our Wings and take flights. But we are still entangled in our Wings.

What to say now? We are still stuck up in mud. Which is not correct. But after this everyone should make his mind great. Greatness should be adopted. And this acceptance of greatness should be enjoyed by everyone. So many people come here. You do not speak with them, meet them. Do not do any introduction with anyone. That is wrong.

When these people come many of you help them, serve them, agreed. But you should introduce yourself with them. Make freindship with them because they are your brothers and you do not have any brothers or any sisters. These are your relatives. It is said that they are your own near and dear ones. Gyaneshwara has said clearly that these are your own Kith and Kin. these are your own Kith and Kin. All others are not your relatives. There is no comparison between you and them. They say something and do something else.

I can say about my family that some are in Sahajayoga, they are there. Those who are not Yogis I do not know them. They are Strangers. So those people who are not in Sahajayoga are not relatives, accept this. You will be surprised. Many things will be given up. Now there is Maratha. Then Maratha should marry Maratha. Then it is OK if he is beating his Wife. It is OK even if he is not Sahajayogi.

It is OK however way he is treating her. But Maratha should marry Maratha. Why? Tommorrow if that girl is in trouble then will your Maratha stand by her? But Sahajayogi will stand by her. Sahajayogi should marry Sahajayogi and there if something goes wrong then Mother we married in Sahajayoga therfore we got in trouble. This Cast system or internal hatred about religion or about another Caste or for another Country that will be disappeared only after marrying. I do not see any other solution. We can understand by seeing it. Just few days ago I made one Maratha girl’s marriage in Australia.

Her family members made a big issue and said that they will go to the Police. I said,“ Go. Do as you like.” She is an adult now. She has all the rights. They did (tried) a lot but nothing could work out. Now that girl is very wise and got married so nicely. Her husband has a good Salary, etc. They see this. Now all of them want to go to Australia with packings.

At the time of marriage they did stupidity. Likewise we are Bramhins and marry only with Bramhins and if tommorrow that Bramhin threw out of the house, what will you do? Then you will come to me. Mataji, please do something about our Son-in-law. What should I do? You yourself found such a Bramhin Son-in-law. Then have it ! Why should I do for that? Like this many big big things we are wasting blindly and all these problems stood in front of us because we did not raise our Aim. We are Yogis.

From inside we have become Ascetics Though from outside we are free from worldly matters, we have become Ascetics. You should be proud that you have become Ascetics and you should be happy about it. Otherwise you will not progress, will never progress. Whatever you do you will not progress until you make your mind great. And we have many misunderstandings in us those should go away. No one will be called as real Yogi unless all these false ideas go away. So no one should keep these all kinds of strange, peculiar things in them. You will be surprised about what I say. Before this in this Maharashtra whichever many great Saints, Sages took birth. Very great Saints.

Those Saints and Sages have told the same thing that Cast system, Religion-fanticism are very bad things. Take any Stone and Take any Stone and put Shendur or Kumkum on it. It is said that Nrusimha Saraswati (Freedom fighter) used to spit on it. If he saw something like that used to spit on it. He raised his Weapons against them many a times. But he was alone and so people troubled him. Dnyaneswara also suffered a lot. He was tortured because he was Sanyasi’s son. Though he was son of Sanyasi, he was higher than all the Bramhins. In such a way many things has happened happened in our Country.

So we should learn from that history and now we have become Yogis. Therefore in such situations we should behave ourselves so that we are standing on our Basic Principles. We have achieved everything. So we do not belong to those things. We are only Yogis and these things do not suit to Yogis. In such way all the false ideas or whatever way you had them till today should be given up and we should place God in our hearts. Without being obstinate all those things should be given up. Give up completely. Chokha Mela was also a Saint. And likewise Ramdas Swami was also a Saint.

But followers of Ramdas Swami and followers of Chokha Mela are fighting with each other. It is a amazing. If both are Saints why should there be any fight between them. But it will be. Because there is no vision so these things happen. Therefore I want to tell you that We have to come out of this Cast system and stupidity. In Muslims, in Christianity it is same thing everywhere. Though following these Religions tell me one thing that have you anywhere seen that man can not do any Sin because of any Religion? Ready for all kinds of Sins. Though he is Muslim, Hindu or Christian.

I have not seen any one who will not commit any Sin. But Yogis can not do any Sin. If they do then Vibrations will go from hands. Saints never did Sins. No one had to tell them. Automatically they became like that. We should become like that and achieve that Stability forever. Sahajayoga is a gate of Salvage (Moksha). So you should feel great that you came to Sahajayoga. You should respect yourself and you should grow in that respect.

Actually we do not have to sacrifice anything in Sahajayoga. Yes, but if you give up your Wisdom then we can not do anything. But we do not need people who are great Sacrificers. On the contrary there are only benefits. Everyone gets benefited but there is also an illusion. One should not get lost in that There are many benefits. You will get Laxmi’s blessing, shall get good health. May get various benefits. But it is an illusion. Beyond that is Spirit.

That we should achieve and should be dwelling in it. This I am telling you very clearly and everyone should give up all the things of Religions and Religions fanaticism. Likewise Atheists also should open their Eyes and see if there God exists or not. They do not have any authority to deny God, existence of God. Who are they to say such things? And if they say so then they are wrong because they have not yet seen if God exists or not. So there should be Purity. One should make oneself absolute pure. And in that Purity we should understand know God. Otherwise it won’t be understood.

There won’t be oneness, unity and any benefits ever. Unnecessarily we should not come here as we travel to do pilgrimage to Pandhari. I request you all that you should achieve something. A very sincere request. I see that here in Maharashtra apart from lot of hardwork why Sahajayoga has not deeply established. Because only by doing my Puja nothing will happen. What is the use? You are anyway doing my puja in all Temples. To do only Puja is useless here. Today it should be decided and determined that we are doing Shri Mataji’s puja keeping all this fanaticism away.

We are doing Shri Mataji’s puja keeping ourself clean. Then only there will be benefit. Otherwise I am suffering from Puja. This is a big authority. And though I have given you, you should acquire that deservence. And I bless you all! Many blessings! Please attention to yourself. Know your importance! Know your greatness!

Today which Task you have taken. I have started this great Work of Evolution of Universe. You are standing there and you should be prepared for that. Everyone should be strong and ready. Today is the first Day. Therefore, I say explicitly that you are organising whatever to be done. But I am not doing it Mother is doing if you think this way and then then whatever we are doing in that let only Divine Work be manifested if you desire this then everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. Anyway, I bless you all. May God bless you all!
