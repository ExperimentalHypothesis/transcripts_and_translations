Gondhal (Drama) and Bhajans, Kolhapur, India, January 1st, 1983

[Shri Mataji speaks at 48:08]They are playing the praise of the Goddesses, also my praise and they are thankful to you for giving money to them, it's a simple expression of your love for your Mother.

And it’s a very simple drama for village that they perform, entertain people in that they talk of God and all the work of the Goddess. It’s a very good way to learn- to entertain the villagers and to tell them about the Goddess [inaudible] for this, they have this play. And [inaudible name of a person] has done very well.

And I hope you all enjoyed the [inaudible] but I will translate it to you later on because they will tape it. But I must say, I’m very much impressed by the way these people are doing this work, in the name of Swaroopa Aranji [unsure] who was such a great soul, who is no more.

And I would like to give to them a present from all of us because you are my children and you are just the same. You have to get this Realization completed from this knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, how to give Realization, how to give Kundalini jagruti, what sort of a man he was, that he wanted you to know all these things and you have to know your atma. That’s what it is.May God bless you.So, [inaudible] for their ascent.[49:31]

[1:10:46]These are beautiful sayings of Parama and other saints [unsure]. They say two more things in their [inaudible], "No use having attachment to your family and relations and all that. They are not going to stand by you, it’s only your Spirit that is going to stand by you". 

And they say that we have six horses of lust, greed, and six of them as I’ve told you, "mada", "matsaras". Other things also, all these six filths. And they guide you, advise you, "You should be the driver and not become the slave of those horses". It’s a beautiful, they are saying that, "We should put our devotion to God and be attached to God and He is the one who is eternal".

Then about Shri Krishna, they are saying that, "Now Pandavas [family of Arjuna] have gone and also Gandharvas [celestial being] have gone. Only one person is still remaining in this world, it is Shri Krishna. He is the Father and He is the Mother and that’s how we should stick on to that person who is eternal, not to persons who are just perishable, all the relations are perishable. Only the relationship with God is eternal".

The way of reaching people and telling them about God ‘s blessings and our duties towards ourselves, is a very good way and a simple method of the villagers and the people of common life. Not extraordinary, genial people but very common, what we call [Sanskrit word], of all people. It’s very easily understood and it’s very easily rendered, it’s very [inaudible].I think you understand this. This has kept this country very much glued down to religion and to God. This is the thing, all little, little things have given such a good step and such a great sustenance to human beings here, in this country. I say all these things [inaudible].[1:13:01]
