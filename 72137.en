Private conversations in Schwarzsee, 1986, PART 2 (uncompleted)

Warren: I see take the whole floor out and just put a little loft in, like this.
Shri Mataji: The loft, then what’s here? There is also higher loft. So, the height over that is about say 16 feet.
Warren: Oh! At least, Mother.
Shri Mataji: At least.
Sahaja Yogi/Warren: More because actually, your bedroom is about 13 or 14 feet. Actually, without that full ceiling. Then on top of that, there'll be another 9 feet. So, it be 30 it be 25, 20, 23.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, to reach the height, you can’t.
Sahaja Yogi: It will be more or less like this.
Warren: More or less like this. If it was done, it would be more or less, your bedroom would be a little higher than this. Perhaps.
Shri Mataji: I’s already about 8, 9 feet high.
Warren: Yes. There’ll be another foot on this, then the actual projection upwards would be like this. If I can just-
Shri Mataji: No, that’ll be much more, you see, about 8 feet of the height of the roof, plus the top.
Sahaja Yogi: Not 8 feet, Mother. It's about 7 foot the height to the existing ceilings, then on top of that, there's only about 7 feet.
Shri Mataji: So, about 14 feet or plus.
Warren: 14 and 25, 26 feet yes.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, what we can do by changing these [unclear] in my bedroom, a little higher [unclear]

2:12
Arnaud: Shri Mataji, one thing interesting about the Japanese people, when you mentioned the Japanese, today, they are just controlling all the financial world and they're just having the Americans on the neck it's absolutely unthinkable.
Sahaja Yogi: That's why this dollar is going down, Mother. England and America are sort of balancing together but Japan's up here. And Germany's up here and Switzerland is not far behind them.
Shri Mataji: Japan is going to be killed by its own inflation. It will be killed by its own inflation; you just don’t worry. You see, in their own country, the currency- to buy, say, what we buy in England for 1 pound, they have to spend 10 pounds, in their own country.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, that’s true.
Shri Mataji: It’ s like, you see. They say there are bricks of gold [Hindi]. In Lanka, there is the gold brick. Because, you see, like the exchange was done with not with rupees, but with gold bricks. One fellow thought he’ll go and earn a lot of money he went down there. And he made in one day, five bricks of gold. He said, "Why you go there? I am going to be rich now ". So next day, he went for his haircut and he had to pay one brick, finished! By the evening, all the bricks were spent out. And he loaned one to someone.
So, in international relationship maybe. But inflation in that country is so high now. If you want to buy a Japanese [unclear] set in Japan, it is 10 times more than in America.
Sahaja Yogi: They have no competition in Japan.
Shri Mataji: It is. Food is so expensive. My nephew was there, food is so expensive, that education so very expensive.
Sahaja Yogi: And housing also Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Housing is so expensive. I mean, it is a horrid place to live in. He could not save a single pai, he resigned now. He resigned from Shipping Corporation, just resign and came back. He just could not manage [unclear]. And he had at least 10 times more paid there.
Just like here. Rustom is telling me that on the average the salary of a person is 6,000 rupees. Our prime minister in India gets 5,000 rupees.
Sahaja Yogi: As a pilot in the Army, he has 6,000. But there are poor people Shri Mataji today. Shri Mataji: And they are poor people.
Sahaja Yogi: They don't have cloth.
Shri Mataji: You see.
Sahaja Yogi: They don't. To buy a single to top, Shri Mataji, for you, it cost them 300 rupees. Sahaja Yogi: It's all relative.
Arnaud: Is it the same here?
Gregoire: So, it is the same here. This artificial wealth is hiding the fact that it's all rubbish.
Shri Mataji: Russians are the wisest of the whole of you, I must say. They are the best.
They have the best of everything and they have got everything that is natural with them. They have gone to the third world, with all natural things to themselves. And they really having a nice time.

They have all beautiful carpets from India, beautiful embroided things, everything is nice. If to their houses, you never think they [unclear]. All the good wood work is with them. Everything they have got. They have exported, you see, all they have accepted because what you call that trade.
Gregoire: Trade barter system.
Shri Mataji: Barter system. The Swiss are very much against it, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah, really?
Sahaja Yogi: Bilateral goods trade.
Shri Mataji: You see and they going to be in trouble. You see, the Swiss are very poor, if you see them, they are very poor [unclear] in goods.
Gregoire: Of, course.
Shri Mataji: Very poor. Rustom, Gregoire. Sadhana had a visitor from Switzerland. And she was really aghast to see Sadhana's ornaments, which were not also, that she was using, not even from the bank [unclear] spoiled in the bank.
Gregoire: But it is true, Shri Mataji, because, you see, people, most people they have what they earn which is enough to carry the day, but they don't have any reserve.
Shri Mataji: You can’t buy anything.
Gregoire: They don't have. Arnaud and myself are good example Shri Mataji.
Sahaja Yogi: You can’t save.
Gregoire: We have.
Shri Mataji: But in America, it’s [unclear].
Gregoire: Thanks to ashram, thanks, I have been saving money since I left my house in Vienna, naturally, because if I live here-
Shri Mataji: You bought a house.
Gregoire: But if I have my own house I can't save the price, Shri Mataji.
Arnaud: Just one example: to move from one town to another town, because we had to go to Geneva, because there was no place no people in Geneva itself for meditation. No Sahaja Yogis, nothing. So we went to Geneva and all thing happened very sahaj, we got this flat for the time being. Just to move, I have to pay 4 to 5,000 Franks more a year, as taxes.
Gregoire: In rupees this is 20,000 rupees.
Arnaud: 20,000 rupees.
Gregoire: To move
Shri Mataji: It’s quite an artificial, this thing is. [Hindi]

8:30
Arnaud: Ashram is the best solution.
Sahaja Yogi: You can't buy property; we found out about that.
Sahaja Yogi: You can’t?
Sahaja Yogi: It's almost impossible to buy a house here.
Sahaja Yogi: Why?
Sahaja Yogi: Because you just pay back interest all the time. You can't pay off the capital because the interest is so high.

Shri Mataji: It’s not 7 feet, it is 8 feet about CP room’s height.
[About a photo] This is my in-law ... and this is my grand-children.
All right?
Sahaja Yogi: Which is, which one?
Shri Mataji: My room is 8 feet. Maybe little more. This could be 7 and half. This is my room, this one is, this is the,

[Conversation about measurements, the plans, low voices]
9:30
Sahaja Yogi: But I don't understand this part
10:26
Shri Mataji: So now, supposing you remove this, it is all together 22 feet. Now to raise this higher, what you have to do,
....
[Many conversations at the same time]

11:35
Shri Mataji: So then, this if you can remove, you might get it higher.
Warren: You can take those two big beams out, big beams.
Shri Mataji: Four beams are there. You can put be up there
Warren: Relocate the big beams; and then put that across. From the same, I'm very much in favour of raising the height of your room.
