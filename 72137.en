PART 1 (uncompleted)

Shri Mataji: Only thing, he was most satisfied with England.
[Laughter]
He had to come away. He used to say, "Mother, I’ll never go out of London, never". But in one day, he was completely thrown away.
Did you go after that bathroom? Not yet.
Sahaja Yogi: No, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You see. [To the baby] "Your father, we are talking about your father ".

It’s a little shake is there. But I feel she’ll be all right, with her Mother herself, she will be all right.
Kingsley: She’s been sitting, just since we’ve been here, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Sahaja Yogi: Just since we’ve been living with Gregoire, she’s been sitting and starting to crawl and. Just in the last three or four weeks.

Shri Mataji: Never guessed. "You want to have some tea yourself?"
[About the baby]
Shri Mataji: She is a Swiss Sahaja Yogini, looking Indian? Yes. With an Indian face.
Sahaja Yogi: She looks Chinese.
Shri Mataji: No Indian. Ah, now you see this forehead. Like mine. She has an Indian face. [Shri Mataji speaks to the baby girl]
We came to see you only. Yes.
[Laughter]

I don’t think there is any problem now, as such, except that a little bit time it takes to adjust, that’s all. I don’t think the way she is sitting, the way she is having, the whole time she has been sitting, you said. Remarkable, isn’t it?

Did you give her calcium?
Sahaja Yogini: We give her white cheese.
Shri Mataji: No, no. Give her calcium or something. It’s good for her, for bones. Rustom, you’ll get here some calcium.
Rustom: You get calcium drops for children.
Shri Mataji: Are there calcium drops?
Rustom: Hum. Also vitamin D she should get.
Sahaja Yogini: She has.
Shri Mataji: Vitamin D and calcium.
Rustom: Because there’s not much sun here.
Shri Mataji: Sun ‘nahi he’ [There is no]. That’s it.

Sahaja Yogi: What’s her name, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: I forgot.
Gregoire: Radhika.
Shri Mataji: Hum? Radhika, yes. You see, she had a back damage once and I was quite discouraged. But it was from her bhoots. She came looking at the eclipse. And she had two twins in her.

Rustom: I remember in Vienna.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: I was there.
Shri Mataji: And little of weakness come on [unclear] a little bit effect, very little.
Rustom: You had twins.
Sahaja Yogini: Now the twins went.
Kingsley: But it was so silly, Shri Mataji, because we have had actually never seen an eclipse before. And we were sitting in the car, and I said to Ruth, "It’s a cloudy night tonight".
Shri Mataji: Ha.
Kingsley: And then we noticed that all the stars were in the sky. And we said, "Well, what is that?" I mean, we actually hadn’t seen an eclipse Shri Mataji. And then were wondering what it must be?
Shri Mataji: Really?
Kingsley: Yes. Well, if you live in a town all your life, I suppose.
Shri Mataji: Thanks God that you recognized the Moon.
[Laughter].

You don’t know the story of Sadarji [chief] is, that one Sadarji was going; it was setting sun, you see. So, he said, "Is this a sun or a moon?" Another Sadarji came. He said, "That’s an [unclear] it’s a moon and a sun". He said, "I don’t know maybe. Maybe it’s a moon". He said, "No, I created a sun". [unclear] Third one came. "What do you think, is this a sun or a moon?" He said, "I’m sorry, I am a foreigner".
[Laughter].

Rustom: There’s another story, same style, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: There’s another story, the same style. We have two Sadarjis fighting, you see. One is saying, "The Sun is setting in the East". The other one is saying, "The Sun is setting in the West". And then the same story, a third Sadarji comes;
Shri Mataji: Daddies have been doing, made such a fun out of it. Now they are having a nice time.
[Laughter].
Rustom: Before, they were the ones who killed Pakistanis. Now the Pakistanis are supporting them.
Shri Mataji: Stupid fellows.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I think she’s all right. The bones are, they are saying, a little bit at pelvic.
Rustom: Yes, I know.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Rustom: A little lose.
Shri Mataji: They have turned inside sort of. It’s going to be [unclear].
Rustom: It’s very easy to treat it.

Shri Mataji: Hello! [To the baby] Are you eating that?
[Unclear conversation]
Rustom: You see, Shri Mataji, when they are born, the capsule of the hip joint is very shallow. So, it is very easy for the bone to move out.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Rustom: Ji [Yes].
Shri Mataji: But it is due to eclipse sight.
Rustom: Yes, and Swadisthana, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Eclipse, [unclear] this is born with the Moon.
Rustom: Also, one time I remember, Shri Mataji, Ruth had some pain in [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Sun eclipse, mentally derangement [unclear] if you see the Sun eclipse. You saw the Moon.
Ruth: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Sun eclipse gives you a mental derangement. I wish people knew all this. But it is to be understood. After all, when there is Moon in the sky, you see the waves of the- even the waves of the ocean change. So, how can it not have an effect on us? It has on, even on the matter.
This is wisdom. You understand that mister?

You like it very much. Ah! That’s new. What is it?
Kingsley: It’s apple and plum and a little mango and [unclear] sweets.
Shri Mataji: Apple and plum, and boiled together, is it?
Kingsley: No, Shri Mataji, just liquidized.
Shri Mataji: Liquidized. Less sugar.
Kingsley: No, no sugar, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Little sugar would be good. Little.
Now these days, the apples are so insipid here. I was surprised, the fruits are so insipid, absolutely. You get better apples in India than here. It’s really surprising.

And nowadays, I don't know what has happened to India. All kinds of foods, you get everywhere. Otherwise, in the beginning, I remember, while we didn’t even quite wait till we were married, and even after that, we never got apples in Nagpur or Puna or Bombay. Bombay, a little bit, but not in the [unclear]. Only in Delhi we used to get. But now you get in Nagpur, Central in Delhi.
Rustom: Apples everywhere.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: And apples everywhere.
Shri Mataji: Yes!
Rustom: I used to transport. Transport, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You used to transport.
Rustom: Nowadays, they transport them from Kashmir .
Shri Mataji: But this is some sort of a big venture, because normally, we never used to see big Now Rajesh is going to start a company with Jalan, for juices, fresh juices. [unclear]. Because now such a production has started in India- juices. And actually, nowhere you get really, really, good juices in the world. They're all sort of over chemicalized.
Gregoire: They have good apple juices here.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: They have good apple juices here.
Shri Mataji: Apple juices are good.
Gregoire: Yes. Depends which one, some are very good.
[Shri Mataji is drinking tea]
Shri Mataji: It’s good apple juice.
Rustom: So many there.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: She wants some more.
Shri Mataji: She likes the food, yes?
Sahaja Yogi: She loves food.
Gregoire: She's very intense in her attention.

At least, 80 percent children, as today, I saw. I would say they were quite all right. One or two were-
Gregoire: Guido, Shri Mataji speaks to you.
Shri Mataji: So, I mean for the children that I saw, 80% were all right, quite good. I would say quite good. Not excellent, some were excellent, but 80%. But two or three small, small children were possessed. They couldn't see me, you see. When they saw me, they were somewhere else. They couldn't see me.
It's Lakshmi I am worried about [unclear]. Her daughter Lakshmi. She’s quite a big girl. But I remember when we went [unclear]. She had been just born or something.
Warren: But you mean Ruth and that one from England, Mother.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear].
Warren: Tara's child.
Shri Mataji: Oh.
Warren: Ruth's child is Lakshmi also, Ruth from Bristol.
Shri Mataji: But she's all right, she's very sweet, all right. She's very sweet. But maybe Tara doesn't come to the collective. I’ve seen the [unclear] child for the first time. That's the one that is a bit worrying me. Then there's another child, I don't know whose it is, could not look at me.
Warren: Is that Shaun’s wife?
Arnaud: No, it is not Shri Mataji. He is a Swiss boy, he has red hair. When you came to him, just before going in the car, he turned back to you.
Shri Mataji: Ah. Who is he?
Arnaud: What is his name Maria?
Maria: Shridhara.
Arnaud: Shridhara.
Shri Mataji: Shridhara.
Arnaud: It's the second son, it is the grandson of this Magda.
Shri Mataji: Vaikuntha is now all right. He all right.
Arnaud: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Shridhara will be all right after some time. I think so. Vaikuntha. Vaikuntha was good. I remember that. He had given him a drum. So, he was beating the drum all over and telling all the trees, "Shri Mataji comes, Mataji comes to give Realisation". So much so, she said, "She is telling all the trees, everything". [Marathi?]

The whole day, she is like that.
Kingsley: Most particularly, after she's eaten, Shri Mataji. She is particularly very happy after she's eaten.
[Laughter] Like her daddy.
Shri Mataji: You like more your Daddy or Mommy tell me.

It's a fly, is it? In the systematic country, how good they allow a fly do this?
[Laughter]
They are over systematic, aren’t they? Worse are the Germans. They are very systematic- over.
[Marathi?]

Rustom: What it is, Shri Mataji, is that when you are always systematic, then you don't have time or energy to think about anything else. So you can forget God.
Shri Mataji: No, but then you become Ravana, sort of, absolutely abnormal. You become like stone.
But you see, as the main thing is that supposing, you do not think about something. But being acts and that's why they become cruel people. Being acts because being has got all these things within itself. It acts just like, say, heat. Heat will act. It doesn't think but it acts.
Rustom: So being has cruelty in its nature.
Rustom: Hum?
Rustom: Being has cruelty with it.
Rustom: Ah. Anything, I mean, you see, supposing any matter is there, it will act the way it is. If there is steel, it will act like steel. If it is, say, stone. It will act like stone. It cannot act like something else and it cannot do anything about it. It cannot use anything for itself, nothing. Just acts whatever it has, you see, automatic. That's an automatism build in.
Even animals, you see ,cannot act like something else, normally. Unless and until there are in connection with human beings. They do not know. Because animals, whatever is it, say, if it is an elephant, it will remain elephant. Horse will remain horse, act the same way. The scorpion will act the way the scorpion, they will not act like the same, you see.

So, only the human beings can act like whatever they like. They are always. And how? Because they can think. Beyond the thinking, when you go through Sahaja Yoga, then what happens, that you become in charge of all these things. And you start into it: in charge. The first stage is this, where you are a human being.

I always give the example of this motorcar and the driver. An accelerator and a break. You start using accelerator and a break, till you reach a point, where you start knowing how to use both automatically. That is dharma, that is balance. At that time, you are a human being.
Then you become a driver of yourself.
But when you become Realized, what happens that you within yourself start witnessing the driver in you, the accelerator within you, and also with them. So, you yourself become in charge. You become the master of these things. That's what Realization is.
Like there is heat within us, all right? There is anger, there is this, that, all those things are within us. When you become a human being, you start knowing there is anger, there is temper, this is this, that. Then when you get into dharma, then you start using properly that balance where to get angry, where not to get angry, what to do, this is my dharma, this is my wife, this is my husband, this, that.

After that, in the second stage, what happens that you go beyond all this. They do not exist in you in a way that they over power you, that you have to control them. But you start controlling. Not only in the sense whenever you want you get angry, whenever you want to get into another mood, whatever you want, you’ll do. You become dharmatit.

Rustom: Shri Mataji, this word ‘being’ how is it translated in Sanskrit? ‘Bhavanam’ or?
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: This word ‘being’.
Shri Mataji: BE-ING.
Rustom: Because in English, one cannot understand exactly how to translate.
Shri Mataji: You see, that is called ‘vyashti’.
Rustom: ‘Vyashti’.
Shri Mataji: ‘Vyashti’.Or also called in a very, very, [unclear] vyakti.
Rustom: ‘Vyashti’. A bit manifestation.
Shri Mataji: ‘Vyashti’and sushti.
Rustom: ‘Sushti’.
Shri Mataji: ‘Vyashti’and ‘sushti’. ST.
Rustom: ST.

Shri Mataji: A ‘Vyakti’ becomes a ‘Vyashti’ when he is Realized soul.
Rustom: Acha.
Shri Mataji: All right?
Or, in English language, they call it personality [vyaktit]?
Rustom: In English language, there is no word for these things, Shri Mataji. In US, you can come to English ‘manifestation’; manifested [vyakta] actually.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Gregoire: The philosophers have used the word ‘being’ as synonymous to existence, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: ‘Being’ is personality.
Rustom: ‘Being’ is not synonymous. Yes, it's personality, if you want, but it's not synonymous with existence.
Rustom: ‘Being’ comes out of existence.
Shri Mataji: Let’s put it as ‘being’ is [unclear].
Rustom: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: [Unclear].
Rustom: That also comes from the root to manifest, to come into existence.
Shri Mataji: Yes, manifest. [Unclear]. The principle that is manifested is the being.
Rustom: And the root of manifestation is existence.
Shri Mataji: So, this is [unclear].
Rustom: Yes.

The [unclear] for that is bhavan, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Bhavan means created. Bhavan, whatever is created. Bhava. I'm not such a master in Sanskrit as you are, you must know.
Rustom: The name of the Devi is Bhavani. Same root.
Shri Mataji: Because she's the creator.
Rustom: That’s right, you are the base and the [unclear].

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] they have discovered about the Devi, surprising, like spice.
Rustom: There’s one name of the Devi, Bhava Bhaya Harini.
Shri Mataji: Bhava Bhaya Harini. Bhava is whatever is created and whatever fear we have out of the created.
Rustom: She removes it.
Shri Mataji: So, the created is this world, and the Bhaya of the created, that is Bhaya of this world. Harini is the one who takes away.
Rustom: She sang that, that Devi [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Bhava Bhaya Harini.

She is looking at new faces but she doesn't feel funny with new people. She likes it.
Warren has a speciality for children. Really, they take to him so easily.
[Marathi?]
Rustom: We’re calling [unclear]?
Shri Mataji: No, we don’t. This little child has [unclear]. What will happen to the baby? I’m thinking about it. So, we will look after the baby, you think?
Arnaud: Shri Mataji-
Shri Mataji: She doesn't go for work?
Arnaud: For the time being, she is going to work. But she has started a job. So, I don't know the time being. I didn't think of it, just in my mind, when I propose that.
That would be the ideal person because she's a sweet person. But she's going to stop in any case to work, Shri Mataji. So maybe it would be a good thing.

Warren: Shri Mataji, Marie-Laure is still breastfeeding completely, 100%.
Shri Mataji: Really? Why?
Warren: That's a good question. I agree
Shri Mataji: It’s a very systematically when you are bringing up the child.
Warren: Oh it's a big thing Mother that you should, in the West, completely breastfeed your baby until it's about 14 or 15 months, at least.
Shri Mataji: During ten months in India also they do, but I mean, we are very different mothers, but not completely.

[Massaging a baby?]

Shri Mataji: So hard to see. And curing a child is much more sickening. The child is crying all the time, trying to sort of- horrible it is. Better cure hundred lepers than to cure a child. Horrible.
It's all right if the child has some physical problem, but these mental children are really beyond me. They just go on crying, crying, crying, crying.
And what are we to do? We'll be having one for the children, like Guido is having. I think we should help him internationally; don't you think so?
We have money, let us give it to them.
Rustom: Even if every Center gives a hundred pounds a month, it’s more than enough [unsure].
Shri Mataji: More. That’s good. It’s quite a lot.
So, that's why this international thing should be established, it’s better. That way, if you have international, in the week, they look after all the schools, the payment, the education and all that. And pour Guido gets nothing out of it.

So, one school like this, where there could be a creche, like you can say, not creche, but it is from two years to five years, all right. Like we have worked for Guido. Another school could be from five to - what is the, what is the primary is five to?
Guido: Ten.
Shri Mataji: Ten, all right.
Guido: Five to ten.
Shri Mataji: Five to ten. So, one school from five to ten and one school from ten to sixteen. All right.
Now what I just don’t know, that the children who are born with mental problems, what should be about? They cannot be mixed up with other children. For example, this Anand, we should try - I told them to send him away.
[Unclear]

He's very bad; if Bhavani doesn't want, let her go. But what to do about these children?

For those who suffer from mentally handicap, mentally handicap. Gregoire, what is your suggestion?
Rustom: You can have a special asylum for these children.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: A special place for these mentally disturbed children. So, they won't disturb the normal children.
Shri Mataji: Children of Sahaja Yogis only.
Rustom: Sahaja Yogis who are mentally disturbed.
