Private conversations in Schwarzsee, 25 August 1986.

PART 1 (uncompleted) Lunch time.

Shri Mataji: Only thing, he was most satisfied with England.
[Laughter]
He had to come away. He used to say, "Mother, I’ll never go out of London, never". But in one day, he was completely thrown away.
Did you go after that bathroom? Not yet.
Sahaja Yogi: No, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You see. [To the baby] "Your father, we are talking about your father ".

It’s a little shake is there. But I feel she’ll be all right, with her Mother herself, she will be all right.
Kingsley: She’s been sitting, just since we’ve been here, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Sahaja Yogi: Just since we’ve been living with Gregoire, she’s been sitting and starting to crawl and. Just in the last three or four weeks.

Shri Mataji: Never guessed. "You want to have some tea yourself?"
[About the baby]
Shri Mataji: She is a Swiss Sahaja Yogini, looking Indian? Yes. With an Indian face.
Sahaja Yogi: She looks Chinese.
Shri Mataji: No Indian. Ah, now you see this forehead. Like mine. She has an Indian face. [Shri Mataji speaks to the baby girl]
We came to see you only. Yes.
[Laughter]

I don’t think there is any problem now, as such, except that a little bit time it takes to adjust, that’s all. I don’t think the way she is sitting, the way she is having, the whole time she has been sitting, you said. Remarkable, isn’t it?

Did you give her calcium?
Sahaja Yogini: We give her white cheese.
Shri Mataji: No, no. Give her calcium or something. It’s good for her, for bones. Rustom, you’ll get here some calcium.
Rustom: You get calcium drops for children.
Shri Mataji: Are there calcium drops?
Rustom: Hum. Also vitamin D she should get.
Sahaja Yogini: She has.
Shri Mataji: Vitamin D and calcium.
Rustom: Because there’s not much sun here.
Shri Mataji: Sun ‘nahi he’ [There is no]. That’s it.

Sahaja Yogi: What’s her name, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: I forgot.
Gregoire: Radhika.
Shri Mataji: Hum? Radhika, yes. You see, she had a back damage once and I was quite discouraged. But it was from her bhoots. She came looking at the eclipse. And she had two twins in her.

Rustom: I remember in Vienna.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: I was there.
Shri Mataji: And little of weakness come on [unclear] a little bit effect, very little.
Rustom: You had twins.
Sahaja Yogini: Now the twins went.
Kingsley: But it was so silly, Shri Mataji, because we have had actually never seen an eclipse before. And we were sitting in the car, and I said to Ruth, "It’s a cloudy night tonight".
Shri Mataji: Ha.
Kingsley: And then we noticed that all the stars were in the sky. And we said, "Well, what is that?" I mean, we actually hadn’t seen an eclipse Shri Mataji. And then were wondering what it must be?
Shri Mataji: Really?
Kingsley: Yes. Well, if you live in a town all your life, I suppose.
Shri Mataji: Thanks God that you recognized the Moon.
[Laughter].

You don’t know the story of Sadarji [chief] is, that one Sadarji was going; it was setting sun, you see. So, he said, "Is this a sun or a moon?" Another Sadarji came. He said, "That’s an [unclear] it’s a moon and a sun". He said, "I don’t know maybe. Maybe it’s a moon". He said, "No, I created a sun". [unclear] Third one came. "What do you think, is this a sun or a moon?" He said, "I’m sorry, I am a foreigner".
[Laughter].

Rustom: There’s another story, same style, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: There’s another story, the same style. We have two Sadarjis fighting, you see. One is saying, "The Sun is setting in the East". The other one is saying, "The Sun is setting in the West". And then the same story, a third Sadarji comes;
Shri Mataji: Daddies have been doing, made such a fun out of it. Now they are having a nice time.
[Laughter].
Rustom: Before, they were the ones who killed Pakistanis. Now the Pakistanis are supporting them.
Shri Mataji: Stupid fellows.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I think she’s all right. The bones are, they are saying, a little bit at pelvic.
Rustom: Yes, I know.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Rustom: A little lose.
Shri Mataji: They have turned inside sort of. It’s going to be [unclear].
Rustom: It’s very easy to treat it.

Shri Mataji: Hello! [To the baby] Are you eating that?
[Unclear conversation]
Rustom: You see, Shri Mataji, when they are born, the capsule of the hip joint is very shallow. So, it is very easy for the bone to move out.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Rustom: Ji [Yes].
Shri Mataji: But it is due to eclipse sight.
Rustom: Yes, and Swadisthana, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Eclipse, [unclear] this is born with the Moon.
Rustom: Also, one time I remember, Shri Mataji, Ruth had some pain in [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Sun eclipse, mentally derangement [unclear] if you see the Sun eclipse. You saw the Moon.
Ruth: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Sun eclipse gives you a mental derangement. I wish people knew all this. But it is to be understood. After all, when there is Moon in the sky, you see the waves of the- even the waves of the ocean change. So, how can it not have an effect on us? It has on, even on the matter.
This is wisdom. You understand that mister?

You like it very much. Ah! That’s new. What is it?
Kingsley: It’s apple and plum and a little mango and [unclear] sweets.
Shri Mataji: Apple and plum, and boiled together, is it?
Kingsley: No, Shri Mataji, just liquidized.
Shri Mataji: Liquidized. Less sugar.
Kingsley: No, no sugar, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Little sugar would be good. Little.
Now these days, the apples are so insipid here. I was surprised, the fruits are so insipid, absolutely. You get better apples in India than here. It’s really surprising.

And nowadays, I don't know what has happened to India. All kinds of foods, you get everywhere. Otherwise, in the beginning, I remember, while we didn’t even quite wait till we were married, and even after that, we never got apples in Nagpur or Puna or Bombay. Bombay, a little bit, but not in the [unclear]. Only in Delhi we used to get. But now you get in Nagpur, Central in Delhi.
Rustom: Apples everywhere.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: And apples everywhere.
Shri Mataji: Yes!
Rustom: I used to transport. Transport, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You used to transport.
Rustom: Nowadays, they transport them from Kashmir .
Shri Mataji: But this is some sort of a big venture, because normally, we never used to see big Now Rajesh is going to start a company with Jalan, for juices, fresh juices. [unclear]. Because now such a production has started in India- juices. And actually, nowhere you get really, really, good juices in the world. They're all sort of over chemicalized.
Gregoire: They have good apple juices here.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: They have good apple juices here.
Shri Mataji: Apple juices are good.
Gregoire: Yes. Depends which one, some are very good.
[Shri Mataji is drinking tea]
Shri Mataji: It’s good apple juice.
Rustom: So many there.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: She wants some more.
Shri Mataji: She likes the food, yes?
Sahaja Yogi: She loves food.
Gregoire: She's very intense in her attention.

At least, 80 percent children, as today, I saw. I would say they were quite all right. One or two were-
Gregoire: Guido, Shri Mataji speaks to you.
Shri Mataji: So, I mean for the children that I saw, 80% were all right, quite good. I would say quite good. Not excellent, some were excellent, but 80%. But two or three small, small children were possessed. They couldn't see me, you see. When they saw me, they were somewhere else. They couldn't see me.
It's Lakshmi I am worried about [unclear]. Her daughter Lakshmi. She’s quite a big girl. But I remember when we went [unclear]. She had been just born or something.
Warren: But you mean Ruth and that one from England, Mother.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear].
Warren: Tara's child.
Shri Mataji: Oh.
Warren: Ruth's child is Lakshmi also, Ruth from Bristol.
Shri Mataji: But she's all right, she's very sweet, all right. She's very sweet. But maybe Tara doesn't come to the collective. I’ve seen the [unclear] child for the first time. That's the one that is a bit worrying me. Then there's another child, I don't know whose it is, could not look at me.
Warren: Is that Shaun’s wife?
Arnaud: No, it is not Shri Mataji. He is a Swiss boy, he has red hair. When you came to him, just before going in the car, he turned back to you.
Shri Mataji: Ah. Who is he?
Arnaud: What is his name Maria?
Maria: Shridhara.
Arnaud: Shridhara.
Shri Mataji: Shridhara.
Arnaud: It's the second son, it is the grandson of this Magda.
Shri Mataji: Vaikuntha is now all right. He all right.
Arnaud: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Shridhara will be all right after some time. I think so. Vaikuntha. Vaikuntha was good. I remember that. He had given him a drum. So, he was beating the drum all over and telling all the trees, "Shri Mataji comes, Mataji comes to give Realisation". So much so, she said, "She is telling all the trees, everything". [Marathi?]

The whole day, she is like that.
Kingsley: Most particularly, after she's eaten, Shri Mataji. She is particularly very happy after she's eaten.
[Laughter] Like her daddy.
Shri Mataji: You like more your Daddy or Mommy tell me.

It's a fly, is it? In the systematic country, how good they allow a fly do this?
[Laughter]
They are over systematic, aren’t they? Worse are the Germans. They are very systematic- over.
[Marathi?]

Rustom: What it is, Shri Mataji, is that when you are always systematic, then you don't have time or energy to think about anything else. So you can forget God.
Shri Mataji: No, but then you become Ravana, sort of, absolutely abnormal. You become like stone.
But you see, as the main thing is that supposing, you do not think about something. But being acts and that's why they become cruel people. Being acts because being has got all these things within itself. It acts just like, say, heat. Heat will act. It doesn't think but it acts.
Rustom: So being has cruelty in its nature.
Rustom: Hum?
Rustom: Being has cruelty with it.
Rustom: Ah. Anything, I mean, you see, supposing any matter is there, it will act the way it is. If there is steel, it will act like steel. If it is, say, stone. It will act like stone. It cannot act like something else and it cannot do anything about it. It cannot use anything for itself, nothing. Just acts whatever it has, you see, automatic. That's an automatism build in.
Even animals, you see ,cannot act like something else, normally. Unless and until there are in connection with human beings. They do not know. Because animals, whatever is it, say, if it is an elephant, it will remain elephant. Horse will remain horse, act the same way. The scorpion will act the way the scorpion, they will not act like the same, you see.

So, only the human beings can act like whatever they like. They are always. And how? Because they can think. Beyond the thinking, when you go through Sahaja Yoga, then what happens, that you become in charge of all these things. And you start into it: in charge. The first stage is this, where you are a human being.

I always give the example of this motorcar and the driver. An accelerator and a break. You start using accelerator and a break, till you reach a point, where you start knowing how to use both automatically. That is dharma, that is balance. At that time, you are a human being.
Then you become a driver of yourself.
But when you become Realized, what happens that you within yourself start witnessing the driver in you, the accelerator within you, and also with them. So, you yourself become in charge. You become the master of these things. That's what Realization is.
Like there is heat within us, all right? There is anger, there is this, that, all those things are within us. When you become a human being, you start knowing there is anger, there is temper, this is this, that. Then when you get into dharma, then you start using properly that balance where to get angry, where not to get angry, what to do, this is my dharma, this is my wife, this is my husband, this, that.

After that, in the second stage, what happens that you go beyond all this. They do not exist in you in a way that they over power you, that you have to control them. But you start controlling. Not only in the sense whenever you want you get angry, whenever you want to get into another mood, whatever you want, you’ll do. You become dharmatit.

Rustom: Shri Mataji, this word ‘being’ how is it translated in Sanskrit? ‘Bhavanam’ or?
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: This word ‘being’.
Shri Mataji: BE-ING.
Rustom: Because in English, one cannot understand exactly how to translate.
Shri Mataji: You see, that is called ‘vyashti’.
Rustom: ‘Vyashti’.
Shri Mataji: ‘Vyashti’.Or also called in a very, very, [unclear] vyakti.
Rustom: ‘Vyashti’. A bit manifestation.
Shri Mataji: ‘Vyashti’and sushti.
Rustom: ‘Sushti’.
Shri Mataji: ‘Vyashti’and ‘sushti’. ST.
Rustom: ST.

Shri Mataji: A ‘Vyakti’ becomes a ‘Vyashti’ when he is Realized soul.
Rustom: Acha.
Shri Mataji: All right?
Or, in English language, they call it personality [vyaktit]?
Rustom: In English language, there is no word for these things, Shri Mataji. In US, you can come to English ‘manifestation’; manifested [vyakta] actually.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Gregoire: The philosophers have used the word ‘being’ as synonymous to existence, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: ‘Being’ is personality.
Rustom: ‘Being’ is not synonymous. Yes, it's personality, if you want, but it's not synonymous with existence.
Rustom: ‘Being’ comes out of existence.
Shri Mataji: Let’s put it as ‘being’ is [unclear].
Rustom: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: [Unclear].
Rustom: That also comes from the root to manifest, to come into existence.
Shri Mataji: Yes, manifest. [Unclear]. The principle that is manifested is the being.
Rustom: And the root of manifestation is existence.
Shri Mataji: So, this is [unclear].
Rustom: Yes.

The [unclear] for that is bhavan, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Bhavan means created. Bhavan, whatever is created. Bhava. I'm not such a master in Sanskrit as you are, you must know.
Rustom: The name of the Devi is Bhavani. Same root.
Shri Mataji: Because she's the creator.
Rustom: That’s right, you are the base and the [unclear].

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] they have discovered about the Devi, surprising, like spice.
Rustom: There’s one name of the Devi, Bhava Bhaya Harini.
Shri Mataji: Bhava Bhaya Harini. Bhava is whatever is created and whatever fear we have out of the created.
Rustom: She removes it.
Shri Mataji: So, the created is this world, and the Bhaya of the created, that is Bhaya of this world. Harini is the one who takes away.
Rustom: She sang that, that Devi [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Bhava Bhaya Harini.

She is looking at new faces but she doesn't feel funny with new people. She likes it.
Warren has a speciality for children. Really, they take to him so easily.
[Marathi?]
Rustom: We’re calling [unclear]?
Shri Mataji: No, we don’t. This little child has [unclear]. What will happen to the baby? I’m thinking about it. So, we will look after the baby, you think?
Arnaud: Shri Mataji-
Shri Mataji: She doesn't go for work?
Arnaud: For the time being, she is going to work. But she has started a job. So, I don't know the time being. I didn't think of it, just in my mind, when I propose that.
That would be the ideal person because she's a sweet person. But she's going to stop in any case to work, Shri Mataji. So maybe it would be a good thing.

Warren: Shri Mataji, Marie-Laure is still breastfeeding completely, 100%.
Shri Mataji: Really? Why?
Warren: That's a good question. I agree
Shri Mataji: It’s a very systematically when you are bringing up the child.
Warren: Oh it's a big thing Mother that you should, in the West, completely breastfeed your baby until it's about 14 or 15 months, at least.
Shri Mataji: During ten months in India also they do, but I mean, we are very different mothers, but not completely.

[Massaging a baby?]

Shri Mataji: So hard to see. And curing a child is much more sickening. The child is crying all the time, trying to sort of- horrible it is. Better cure hundred lepers than to cure a child. Horrible.
It's all right if the child has some physical problem, but these mental children are really beyond me. They just go on crying, crying, crying, crying.
And what are we to do? We'll be having one for the children, like Guido is having. I think we should help him internationally; don't you think so?
We have money, let us give it to them.
Rustom: Even if every Center gives a hundred pounds a month, it’s more than enough [unsure].
Shri Mataji: More. That’s good. It’s quite a lot.
So, that's why this international thing should be established, it’s better. That way, if you have international, in the week, they look after all the schools, the payment, the education and all that. And pour Guido gets nothing out of it.

So, one school like this, where there could be a creche, like you can say, not creche, but it is from two years to five years, all right. Like we have worked for Guido. Another school could be from five to - what is the, what is the primary is five to?
Guido: Ten.
Shri Mataji: Ten, all right.
Guido: Five to ten.
Shri Mataji: Five to ten. So, one school from five to ten and one school from ten to sixteen. All right.
Now what I just don’t know, that the children who are born with mental problems, what should be about? They cannot be mixed up with other children. For example, this Anand, we should try - I told them to send him away.
[Unclear]

He's very bad; if Bhavani doesn't want, let her go. But what to do about these children?

For those who suffer from mentally handicapped, mentally handicapped. Gregoire, what is your suggestion?
Rustom: You can have a special asylum for these children.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: A special place for these mentally disturbed children. So, they won't disturb the normal children.
Shri Mataji: Children of Sahaja Yogis only.
Rustom: Sahaja Yogis who are mentally disturbed.

Shri Mataji: But that responsibility should be of the parents.
Rustom: They are so hopeless, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Otherwise, they will neither bother to clear themselves out or to be all right.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, I'm not making any suggestion, Shri Mataji. But let's face it, I mean, there are a lot of- I mean a child like this Inès or Shalini, is she [more] worth of it or not, than a normal child from non-Sahaja Yogi, who don't meditate, who don't worship? I don't know.
Shri Mataji: She's absolutely a gone case. She’s not a normal child.
Gregoire: So, the answer is yes. But that means that Sahaja Yoga children are, of course, more attacked than normal children of non-Sahaja Yogi, because negativity wants to finish them off. While negativity is not interested in normal children. I think, if we face it, this is the truth.
Shri Mataji: Which one?
Gregoire: It means that I disagree with the idea of having an asylum for children because that would give us a very bad name. An asylum for Sahaja Yoga children and we are supposed –
Shri Mataji: No, I would say, start it the other way round. Let us see if there are some children like that, and if they don't improve, the parents, let them go out of Sahaja Yoga, work it out, put their children all right, get better.

Gregoire: Put their children where, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Right.
Warren: Like Graham and Gael did in a way. They went out of Sahaja Yoga for about 6 months, and everything got better.
Gregoire: You see, I think this is very interesting because sometimes it looks like these children, like us, have just a nuisance value for the bhoot. If the negativity can go to Sahaja Yoga or if the negativity can go to you, then they'll really be happy and they'll stick on.
Warren: It puts the responsibility back where it belongs, with the parents.
Shri Mataji: No, this is one solution, I don’t know. We have to ask such parents to go out of Sahaja Yoga, to get their children treated first. Then they will have intensive time for their children to get better.
Warren: Leaving it to somebody else is an escape for your own problems.
Gregoire: This would mean Shri Mataji, that if the children don't improve, in an ashram like Guido’s, they should go back to their parents, and in turn, the parents should be asked to leave the collectivity. Is that so?
Shri Mataji: I think so. What do you say?
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji, it seems so.
Shri Mataji: They are to be a permanent liability with their parents.
Gregoire: Because if it comes to a point where these children are vectors, really vectors of attacks against Sahaja Yoga.
Shri Mataji: And also their parents are, in the way. I would say, because now in this case, that boy, you see, Simon is a very hard fellow. I told him that, "You give up your ego. If you don't give up your ego your child will go and separate [unsure]". I had cured the child. Again the child is not cured. He is still going on with this [unclear].
Gregoire: The difficult situation, Shri Mataji, is when you have a good member of a couple and a bad one, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

Warren: That's okay; let them work it.
Gregoire: Hum?
Warren: Let them work it out outside. The good one will be good and the bad one will come up.

Shri Mataji: You have to make a stop somewhere, somehow, for this negativity not to crawl into us. Because, you see, it will make us very weak, that's all. I mean, name, I don't care much because I'm Nishkalanka. But otherwise.
Gregoire: That was a bureaucrat’s reaction, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: I know. Bureaucrats always think about the [unclear] they have, towards names.
Which bureaucrat has a good name? I don't know.

Gregoire: Would India be the solution?
Shri Mataji: You mean what? In that school, we can't have mentally handicapped children. That's one thing for sure. You see, that school will start at the age of 10 years or 9 years for children. We can't, I mean, have handicapped children attached to that, you see. Because, as it is, handicapped children are bhootish. But we can have an organization or such, where we pay the people who can look after these in very healthy circumstances. And put these children there. It can be solved, can be. But it should not be our liability. What I feel, if we consider everything, whatever junk they bring with them, it becomes our liability. Only thing, that they once attend my program, finished. Ask them, "What have you done for Sahaja Yoga?" Nothing.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji, this is really- I mean, yes absolutely.

Shri Mataji: Well, I think the parents, as we were treating people for themselves. Supposing somebody was not good. We used to ask to him get out of Sahaja Yoga.
In the same way, they go.
Sahaja Yogi: We should do the same.
Warren: And Mother, surprisingly, that's exactly the news they want to hear. Most of these people are very pleased to think that for a time they have to go out and get well.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Warren: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Who?
Warren: Well, what my experience is that if you tell somebody you go out of Sahaja Yoga, you go out of the collectivity, where you can trouble other Sahaja Yogis, and therefore trouble Mother, if you go out on your own, you're in the direct attention of Shri Mataji and you'll get better. And the bhoots can't trouble the collectivity or Mother. And they accept that and they act on it.

Shri Mataji: They won’t be happy thought. No, that's not true. It would give me the shock of my life. Why would they be happy?
Warren: They are not happy Mother, they accept it.
Rustom: They are relieved for us.
Warren: They are relieved.
Shri Mataji: That’s why they say they are relieved. No but they did not. Like, we are asked Barbara to go out. "Why?" She jumped back on me, letters after letters, "Magda, how many letters this Martha wrote to me? I have nothing against him " I have nothing- this thing, that thing. "Mother, I would like to go back ". You have no idea so many letters she wrote to me. Letters after letter. Even in India she sent me letters.

Gregoire: We have to find some way that this process of becoming a nuisance value to Sahaja Yoga activates the medium capacity of people. There is a kind of process like this. The more we do,
Shri Mataji: The more they are.
Gregoire: The more they are interested.
Shri Mataji: That’s what I am saying. It’s a conclusion I don't think how many will be happy. Why? Terrence, we ask him to get out. You see, Terrence, is a horrible fellow. Oh, he made such a big ‘tamasa’ [unsure]. He came down.
Warren: It's not being thrown out of Sahaja Yoga, Mother. It's seen as a treat. I don't mean to be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga. But I mean, see it as a positive treatment. See it as a positive form of getting you better. It's not that we're throwing them out at all. Go out of Sahaja Yoga, they understand where they can't trouble the collectivity and they can't trouble you. They understand this point.

Shri Mataji: They don’t. I don’t think they understand the life [unclear].
Even this Gael and Graham, they are very unhappy.
Warren: All right, unhappy but they did it, though.
Shri Mataji: Well, they were very angry, unhappy [unclear].
Warren: It should only be used in very few cases. I'm not advocating widely, but there are only a few cases, from time to time.
Gregoire: Yes, but for instance, this is not the absolute. I mean, of course, what you are saying is something we practice in quite some [unclear]. In the case of Magda, for instance, and that I go back to the case now of Badra, because it's going to become actual heat.
Shri Mataji: Who?
Gregoire: Badra, Hugo’s wife.
Shri Mataji: Badra?
Warren: Barbara.
Gregoire: Barbara, just speaking about her, she's already in my left heart. Shri Mataji, these are people we tell them to go, they go one month, two months, Barbara was each time in Vienna. Then she came back.
Shri Mataji: But why she doesn't go out of Sahaja Yoga? But she goes where?
Gregoire: No, ok. But Magda is a better example. Arnaud asked Magda to leave Sahaja Yoga and she was out. She wrote all these letters. Then she came back.
Shri Mataji: Just the same.
Gregoire: And she is just the same!
Warren: Yes but that's- we're talking about the children, whether there's an interest in a born Realized child would be.
Gregoire: Yes, no. I'm no more thinking about children because-
Shri Mataji: Then if we think it will be acceptable, then we you can try, acceptable even it is.
But they should not start hitting the child for that.
Warren: Yes, I agree Mother.
Gregoire: Yes, so sorry. I think we had widened the discussion if we speak only about the child, I don't know. I didn't answer your question. I don't know what is to be done.
Shri Mataji: If a child is born, born all right and [unclear] the parents if the child is back, then we should ask the parents to leave.

Gregoire: I have the very concrete example of Phil and Marie-Laure now before me.
Phil is a very active person in the little group that we are. I would have difficulty to ask him to leave Sahaja Yoga. I think it would be very bad for the couple and for the married life if I asked him to live the collectivity because his child is possessed because of his wife.
Shri Mataji: And then what?
Gregoire: I don't know Shri Mataji.
Warren: I disagree with you. I think that objectively, it would work. I know you're a little more involved but-
Gregoire: No, I'm not involved.
Shri Mataji: Maybe you try, worth trying. Ask both of them to get out. Ask him also that, "You try to treat your wife, and now you stand up on your legs. Treat her like a wife, you know this is good ".
Gregoire: And leave the ashram.
Shri Mataji: Hum? And leave the ashram, yes.
Gregoire: OK.
Shri Mataji: And don't come to any programs.
Gregoire: Phil also.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: Also Phil does not come to any programs.
Shri Mataji: Yes. Let her work it out.
Warren: And he'll be assiduous about it and-
Gregoire: Yes, yes.
Sahaja Yogini: Very good incentive.

Warren: Very good incentive.
Shri Mataji: But he must call us about it.
Warren: And a good incentive -
Shri Mataji: A person like Phil would be very incentive.
Gregoire: Yes, because he's not so much, he's not so much bothered about it. I mean, I don't think he has worked on his wife.
Warren: And for him three months-
Shri Mataji: Yes, he doesn’t bother.
Gregoire: He's floating somewhere, but he does not-
Shri Mataji: Well he thinks she's formidable.
Gregoire: Yes.
Shri Mataji: He thinks she's formidable.
Warren: I mean you tell a good person like Phil; you explain what you're doing. You take them into your confidence and you say, "OK, now it's over to you". And-
Gregoire: But now there is another- OK, this is one possibility.

Shri Mataji: Hum. Better try.
Gregoire: But we, OK. But then we jump a step. Because we have not gone through the step where the baby is given to somebody else and has improved.
Warren: That's true.
Gregoire: We are jumping a step there.
Shri Mataji: No, no. That step one should take, it’s possibly. But now, in their case, we can, because such a small child.
Gregoire: All right.
Shri Mataji: In their case, we can.

That small child was very difficult. I don’t know. Very bad, very bad conditions. How badly caught up.

Arnaud: As soon as, as soon as it was presented.
Warren: See, it’s a classic example of the interim phase is your child. That's where the child is getting better as a result of the nurturing of Guido's work. That we hope would work-
Shri Mataji: That is, you see, that age is better. That’s a different age we are talking about.

Or another moderate way could be that allow the child to grow with the same parents. Better give them alternatives. We don't do anything about the child, until the child is to years. But then we’ll have to open, I don't want Guido to do this.
Gregoire: No, no. But Shri Mataji, this I really thank you, because it's- that's the way the negativity is going to work. I mean, I'm sure he's trying to do a really reasonable job, and he's working. And then three or four completely mad children are coming and that blows the heart up.
Warren: For extreme cases, let's try that.
Gregoire: The argument of wellness is something which is very sound [unsure] for Sahaja Yoga is not responsible. This is one thing.
[Cut in the audio at 45:49]

Shri Mataji: Then we might have plastic. We might have another kind, you.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, also, in my ignorance, there is another point where I'm unsure is in which case physical movement helps, in which case it doesn't. Because if the bhoots are local, identified with a place, then sending someone for instance to Australia should help or vice versa. Like it seems that something standing, it has worked for adults, at least. I mean Jame's wife was a good example. She crossed those three oceans and she became very good in relatively short time.
Shri Mataji: On, I know. Let’s say not only by transferring us. You see what happened with her, she was starting thinking that she is the owner of the place itself. She can rule people and that as she has children in [unclear] and all that, she is sort of , I mean, in charge with [unclear].

And in that situation, she behaved in a funny manner. But as soon that she realized that she would be thrown away, that shocked her actually. It's not so much of the transference as you think is. She was not so ‘bhootish’ as you think. She was egoistical. She was like, more like, rigid. So the shock, you see, that she'll be losing this position- Brigit, we can put her right tomorrow [unsure]- as soon as we tell her that, "You have to go away from here, somewhere else" she will be all right too.
Warren: Even saying that she can't go to Shudy Camps will give her a hell of a shock.
Shri Mataji: Itself has done some good. Because her children improved a lot, their health improved a lot. Their appetite opened. She was very happy in Shudy Camps.

Warren: There's another point to this, Mother, this is how it happens in India especially in Bombay and Puna. As soon as there is a problem, they get sent out. And before too long, they're back again.
Shri Mataji: For that, you have somebody like Modi.
Warren: But they come back, Mother. I've seen it. With my own eyes, I've seen it.

Shri Mataji: You see, there is one difference, when I think about Indians. You are a very naïve people.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji-
Shri Mataji: You see, there, Gregoire, it's a different.
Gregoire: We don't-
Shri Mataji: To them, to them, you see, to get possessed is worse than leprosy.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji we don't see. Nobody I mean, this Inès business is the big news of the day. That's the only thing that Phil said. He said, "I didn't notice that she was". No, but I mean I have been in grief [unsure] for quite some time. And I work in my own ways. Because I cannot focus on a child and say, "He's possessed". And I think very few people have that capacity in Sahaja Yoga. So before we- 49:04
Shri Mataji: It's a difference. You are very naïve [unclear] are different. You live with such mundane things, such gross things. I mean, all the time you are busy, which side of the chair somebody should seat, sort of a nonsense, you see. The subtler things, you don’t know. That's why it's such a problem! Now you have all your dead bodies buried in a church. It’s such a lunatic asylum now in the city. Now you are going to open out a lunatic asylum. What is going to happen to your children?
Gregoire: They go to-
Shri Mataji: I mean nobody, no Indians will send once; supposing I really tell them that they have opened out a lunatic asylum and lunatics are running about, Indians will run out. Actually, half of them will disappear. Really!

These all Gujaratis will bundle off it, I tell you, they did not notice that [unsure]. It’s like lepers being let loose. You see, what happened, our house in Lucknow, not even on rent. And there, the people, there was one party, that they had taken the big house. They [unclear]. But the one who were living up there, without paying any rent, they were saying that, "We just look after the house, you give us the house" and all that. A friend of one of my relations was staying up there. There is a small flat. He would not leave. And we- another party which wanted to take it on rent, did not take it when there's somebody like that in it.
So, we asked them, requested them, did everything for about six, seven months we lost all the rent and we didn't know what to do. He said he will go and live on there. His diplomat's father is very- I don’t know. They got three, four mad people and put them in the ground floor. And he told them that they are going to stay. Next morning, cleared out! Cleared out, absolutely!
Warren: Mother's going to do this in Shudy Camps, by bringing all the mad people and put a notice up on the door
Shri Mataji: No, but-
Warren: And the other owners will run away.
Gregoire: You never know, some may say, it’s good vibrations.
Shri Mataji: No, no. But the other thing . I tell you that, as soon as you bring mad people, everybody will act, "How are you? Can I bring tea for you?
Gregoire: Yes, yes, yes.
Shri Mataji: Everybody has a little-
Gregoire: People have so much love. Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Because they have a sympathy.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji, you know what we found out, in Founex, this house we had in Founex. We found out ,two days before leaving, that it had been used for handicapped children. And that's, and we have been fighting with this, that's why the house would never clear out. It was full of spiders. We had puja; yet, nothing doing. And we had horrible dreams and the children were, all our children were affected by this business too. Shri Mataji, we don't know how to fight bhoots. You see, we give a bandhan, what do we do? I move my hand; I don't know what happens. I don't see what happens.
Shri Mataji: And the country is full of it, you see. That's why you have schizophrenia, you have all this. So, so much full [unclear] it’s like, like lice in the head of a mad man.
[Laughter]
Gregoire: The head of Medusa
Shri Mataji: That’s what it is. [Unclear]

There's no fear about it, there's no fear. They have no fear, I mean, they have no fear. "Why do you have it? " They have no fear! The ego is so that they not even afraid of the AIDS. They have no fear about getting drugged. I mean there's no fear and that's the main point. A simple thing in India, people don't do it because they have fear.
Gregoire: And there is nothing, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: But if you are aware, here the people are like that they put their hands into the mouth of a snake: bite me, bite me, bite me!
Gregoire: You see, Shri Mataji, in the science fiction 80% of the teams of horror movies,
Shri Mataji: They are like this.
Gregoire: Is that the dead are back on Earth and are invading the living, the world of the living. This is what these people express in their own possession. But that's what is happening as a matter of fact. So, up to a certain point, we use lemons, we foot soak, we do this, we do that, and come to a point where all this doesn't seem to work. And then what do we do?
Shri Mataji: [Unclear] One case should not put pressure to that [unsure].
Gregoire: No but we-
Shri Mataji: We have cured people. Now they are all right [unsure]. It's not that bad. [Unclear] few places like that, it concerns us because of a person failed. I’ve seen like that. But-

Gregoire: Yes I mean, statistically speaking, probably it looks it looks insignificant.

Shri Mataji: Look at [unclear], when he came to me first. Or Yves [unclear].
Gregoire: No but-
Shri Mataji: Or Douglas.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji. In Switzerland, I must say we have had a lot of it, because I don't mention my family, which is what you know.
Shri Mataji: Mathias.
Gregoire: But we had Mathias, we had Vaikuntha who was completely, for hypnosis [unsure]. Hanumana was even-
Shri Mataji: [Unclear] mother. Hanumana.
I mean all of them.
Shri Mataji: Even his wife got caught up and [unclear] down.
Arnaud: Marie-Martine is much better.
Shri Mataji: Marie-Martine. Marie-Martine, oh God! Marie-Martine was a mad woman.
Then we had- I mean so many were having catches. Practically everybody was little off.
Arnaud: That's a good sign that it's an improvement, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: That's it. You see, we cannot say that it has not worked out despite the fact there were all kinds of problems, people were drug addicted. Mooladhara!
Warren: I'd say, on the contrary, the basic practices of Sahaja Yoga work in every case, except just one or two. And this is what we're talking about. In each country, there are one or two, finished! Guido’s system works as a second line of defence. But a third line of defence could be this, that's all, for one or two.
Shri Mataji: I agree. I've been seeing that. But for these, you get worried.
Warren: No, don't be worried. Let's be clearcut about it.

Shri Mataji: Yes, it's not so bad. I mean [unclear] about this.
Guido: Before Realization, we were all gone cases.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Guido: Before Realization we were all gone cases.
[Laughter]

Gregoire: The only difference, we didn’t know, that’s all.
Shri Mataji: There are some Swiss [unclear] certified themselves.
Warren: I mean they're all sitting around here, those some pretty gone cases!
[Laughter]
Arnaud: I would say all of us.
Shri Mataji: This way or that way.
Arnaud: I mean, on one side or on another side.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: [Unclear], just come on well, no doubt. But, it's a prophet here.

What are these little light things are?
Kingsley: It's Ruth's collection of mirrors, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: From mirrors?
Kingsley: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Collection of mirrors is a good idea. But only mirrors?
Kingsley: Well, some are mirrors and there's a drawing. And then there are two pieces of bas-relief that were found from the ruins of an old church. Shri Mataji, those two pieces of stone from a very old church in France, somewhere or I think- I'm not quite sure. Ruth knows the story.

Shri Mataji: I mean if you want to have mirrors, I can send so many of them. My daughter used to say, "You’d better start a shop of mirrors and combs and garlands".
[Laughter]
So they said, "One day, we have a celebration of the [unclear]". [Unclear] is the one where a married woman is regarded as something great. So we are supposed to call women for Haldi, Kumkum, and give them something. So, one day she had invited. She said, "Mother what should I give? " I said, "Now give my mirrors". So in one [unclear] Kumkum she gave my mirrors. There were so many, so small, this much! I mean, of course, given in the Puja, I kept away. But otherwise, so many mirrors I had! [Unclear] Even now, I must be having at least hundred. India is a place for mirrors. I didn't know she was collecting mirrors; I can give her so many! It’s a good idea.

They are all antique ones, are they?
Kingsley: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah!
Kingsley: Nearly all.
Shri Mataji: What is this three of them means?
Arnaud: It's like a tryptic.
Shri Mataji: What?
Kingsley: Yes; It's a- I don’t know, Shri Mataji. Arnaud says it’s a little bit like a tryptic. It opens out.
Warren: Like on a dressing table, you know how, Mother, you have three with a window.
Shri Mataji: No, but it is hanging with one thing only, very well done.
Warren: Especially hooked up. [Laughter] In bathrooms, they often, in old houses, used to have those three.
Shri Mataji: Oh. But she had very good icons.

Kingsley: I think-
Shri Mataji: Very good icons.
Gregoire: They were false Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: All?

Kingsley: All the paintings that Ruth bought in in Rome, Shri Mataji, turned out to be-
Gregoire: Not in Rome, in Geneva.
Kingsley: In Geneva, turned out to be fake.
Warren: Swiss fakes.
Gregoire: Was he Swiss?
Kingsley: Yes, the man was Swiss. And she is very sensitive about it.
[Laughter]
Gregoire: When we ask about Sahaja Yogis, is he Swiss, no is Argentinian. No, but if we speak about Swiss...
Shri Mataji: Swiss fakes, means what? They were done by Swiss for
Kingsley: We don't know whom they were done by Shri Mataji, but they were all-
Gregoire: Sold as a name but it was not.
Arnaud: Sold much more expensive than it should be.
Shri Mataji: She must have paid a lot.
Kingsley: She paid a fortune, Shri Mataji, and felt very, very hurt, because this man traded it, on a very close friendship with her and her sister. And treated them like daughters. And all the time he was milking them of money with these horrible fakes. The icons were quite nice but even the icons were-
Shri Mataji: Not real.
There's one thing I wanted to ask Ruth that she had some money in New York with some lady. And it’s a possibility we have a very good lawyer there, who can prosecute that plead for that So, she could give me the papers now we are going to San Francisco, San Francisco, San Diego. We need to meet that lawyer.
Gregoire: Ruth!
Kingsley: Ruth!
Shri Mataji: I think poor Ruth has a special luck to these thieves [unclear].
Gregoire: Yes poor thing. It looks like this.

Shri Mataji: Are you wearing the sweater?
Gregoire: Shri Mataji says, she has a very good lawyer in New York. Do you have the papers?
Shri Mataji: Not in New York. He is actually in San Diego.
Gregoire: San Diego.
Shri Mataji: And he's a very famous lawyer. We’ve got it now for this [unclear] show we got him. And now he's going to meet me. So, I was thinking, that lady who has taken your money, you can try.
Ruth: Yes, Shri Mataji, of course. I have the papers in the office. You are going at the start of September?
Shri Mataji: No, I am going now. So, I should go to tomorrow.
Tomorrow, if you can.
Ruth: I said in the office I was sick. But maybe Kingsley could go and get them for me. It would be nice. At least, you could copy them and give me some copy of that.
Gregoire: We can send it by Express.
Shri Mataji: Or you can write a letter saying what is it. And I'll ask him. At least, I’ll show him. And if he needs, you can send him the whole case.
Yes, he manages many things. Now I don't know what he is doing [unclear]. But Sada told me that [unclear] can have telephone.

Ruth: I have just tried again a new tentative to find her address. She seems to be escaping with her address. And every time for Rogatory commissions, they try to go and interrogate her. She seems to be disappearing in the nature. But then again, recently, in the last year or two, it seems that there have been a few interviews of her in some American newspapers, business reviews, and like that, as the success woman and success business woman and such things.
Shri Mataji: So you got it.
Ruth: So I found again the address, at least of her husband where he's working. And I send it to my lawyer and he's trying also.
Shri Mataji: Then we can tell the New papers also
Ruth: Oh, it would be good.
Kingsley: But the judge, in this particular case, is a very, seems to be a very nasty, lazy gentleman, who is quite prepared to waste time and do nothing about it.
Shri Mataji: Where? Here?
Ruth: In Geneva. He's also in charge.
Shri Mataji: They are all like that, I think. You know, judge have no respect for [unclear].
Ruth: He is also in charge to of the Marco’s or the Philippine tentative to get back the Marco’s money. And it seems that also there, he's very lazy.
Shri Mataji: He’s not going to get anything out of it, anyway. He's in charge of getting money. Lost money, isn’t it?
Ruth: Yes, a kind of restitution it to the Philippine government.
Shri Mataji: Really, they have a lack of appointing the right people at right places, I think.
[Laughter]
Warren: He's probably in hand with him.
Kingsley: He's probably a friend of Marcos.
Warren: He's probably in league.
Ruth: And my lawyer-
Shri Mataji: Is he?
Warren: Probably. I mean that's the way things go.
Kingsley: It’s quite possible.
Ruth: Well my lawyer-
Shri Mataji: But he cannot appoint Marcos, he cannot appoint somebody.
Warren: No, but I mean they can must be-
Shri Mataji: He must have been appointed by him. All right.
Ruth: Well my lawyer told me that, as a bureaucrat they, could not send him away. So, they put him in the place where he is least harmful, this particular judge.
Shri Mataji: They would not send him away.
Ruth: They cannot because he's appointed as bureaucrat.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear].
[Laughter]

Warren: Bureau - bureaucrat.
Sahaja Yogi: I'm getting deaf.
Shri Mataji: He is dealing with such a big thing like Marcos, and he's also dealing with your case. It is something I can’t understand. Is there only one judge or?
Ruth: He's judge of in instruction and I don't think there are many judges of instruction. Maybe five or six.
Warren: Instruction?
Shri Mataji: The best thing is-
Ruth: It’s called like that in French.
Shri Mataji: Best thing is to send wires, telegrams after telegrams. They reach about 12:00 in the night. You see? That’s how you’ll disturb that [unsure].
Sahaja Yogi: Mother’s method.
Guido: It’s so beautiful.
Shri Mataji: "I'm very much in trouble, only what should I do? I’m desperate [unclear] why don’t you do this and that". Because what can American lawyers also do? Unless and until there is something more [unclear].
Ruth: They tried the first time with the Americans, and they said they did not find her address.
Shri Mataji: But now you have an address for it?
Ruth: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Better say, "Now we found an address, you see, you must help me. I’m a Swiss girl, I'm being this thing. I'm in need of money. I'm in trouble, this, that ". Send him telegrams. Do it for one week. It will be all right. Let’s see.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: "Kantakam kantakaat" [Sanskrit]. Kantakam is a thorn. "Thorn is to be taken out of a thorn".
:Rustom: With a thorn.
Warren: With a thorn you can remove a thorn.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Yes, I think, best is to get after him when you have the address, you see. And you also give me in writing whatever it is. Really I'm surprised how you are cheated all the time.
He's telling me about the fake painting you have had. Who was this stupid fellow ?
Ruth: Nasty old man Shri Mataji,
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Ruth: A nasty old man. And he cheated my sister even much more than me.
Shri Mataji: But you can pursue him.
Ruth: I tried. I had also a lawyer but the lawyer did nothing. So I-
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Ruth: The lawyer only took money from me.
Shri Mataji: Why?
Ruth: And he managed nothing. He was useless Shri Mataji, the lawyer.
Shri Mataji: It’s a Japanese or Korean, somehow? Or Sahaja Yogi?
Arnaud: He is not Shri Mataji. We don't tell a Sahaja Yogi with a lawyer.
Gregoire: No. Yves is not a Sahaja Yogi.
Arnaud: is not a Sahaja Yogi.
Shri Mataji: But he will help. He's a good man.
Arnaud: But still, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Arnaud: Still. Do you know how much a lawyer charge for 1 hour? 600 Franks! Yes.

You remember, Shri Mataji, the case of, the radio case, three years ago, we had all these problems. And I just had a consultation with the lawyer. He just listened to the cassette. They wrote a letter that they could not do anything. We had to pay 600 Francs.
Gregoire: But this is a racket of the first water, Shri Mataji.
Arnaud: Lawyers, this is another stuff.
Gregoire: They are all against the law.
Kingsley: The lawyer was as bad as this man.
Shri Mataji: Why don’t you start to practice?
Arnaud: I should maybe I'm a bit too old, no? 32.
Shri Mataji: But old lawyers are better than young ones.
Arnaud: One thing I should do Shri Mataji, is to go to two years to go in a practice and a practice and then to have my degree, the higher degree to start.
Gregoire: He's not a lawyer, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: He’s done his [unclear].
Gregoire: No. In Switzerland, to practice, first you have to have your basic degree. Then you have two years practice, then you have final examination. All this, he has not done. And final examination, then you are an ‘avocat du barreau’ [barrister] which is entitled to practice. Before, he is not.

Shri Mataji: The solution seems to be like this, you see, that if you get a transfer away from here. Say, India or some place, somewhere, then we can use Indian lawyers, can’t we?
Ruth: The man who cheated me
Arnaud: Because the case has been made here.
Ruth: The man who cheated me for the paintings, he's 80 years old or something like that. He's very old.
Shri Mataji: So you just right to him.
Ruth: I try to, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Then?
Ruth: I sent him a very threatening letter,
Shri Mataji: He is alone?
Ruth: Then he wrote to my sister, and he told my sister, "You should make pressure on your young sister that she should not run after me for money and so on ". And, "How can she?" And my sister wrote him back and told
Shri Mataji: What about? What is he doing with his money? In the bank?
Ruth: His wife is dead. His son died when he was 20 years old of leukaemia. He has nobody else Shri Mataji. And he has no more friends. He's cheated all his friends. He's a lonely horrible old man.
Shri Mataji: There a wife.
Ruth: His wife died of cancer also.
Shri Mataji: You can't even get a ransom out of it.

A ransom, one can get. He can get a ransom of it.
Ruth: Ransom?
Shri Mataji: He can get ransom [unclear].

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, it’s very strange.
[Laughter]
May I talk about something else, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: All right.
Gregoire: I don't know whether it's completely wrong but I get some vibrations when I’m thinking about it. So, I don't know what it's correct or not. But I wonder whether I should get married again, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: And me neither.
Gregoire: Because everybody who is around me get down, one after the other, more or less. Shri Mataji: They’ve done what?
Gregoire: All those who are next to me.
Shri Mataji: Gregoire is a very pessimistic fellow.
[Laughter]

Gregoire: But I get vibrations when I think of it.
Shri Mataji: He is never satisfied. Now shut up now! I had enough. Any time he goes on with pessimistic. See now, anything you give him, he'll give the black side of it. It's a typical bureaucrat. Now stop it!
Gregoire: All right. Why do I feel cool when I think about it?
Shri Mataji: What? What did you think?

Gregoire: That I should tell you that. And I feel vibration I don't understand.
Shri Mataji: You are very deceptive, I think. Better not rely on that.
You see, you have- because the trouble with you, Gregoire, is this way: that you cannot take a stand without having that kind of a bureaucratic fear in your mind. So, when you get up- get out of that bureaucratic fear, then you get cool breeze, in a settler way.
You have that bureaucratic way, "If I get married what is going to happen?"

Your wife is a little bit like you, I must say. This lady also.
Gregoire: No but, that's what I saw today Shri Mataji.
[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogini: Something happened. Something happened this morning with, while you were working on Inès, on this child, the children were upstairs, the two children. And at that time, I thought, it came to my mind, "All right, they are upstairs, they should be OK. And I thought I would go and have a go shoe-beat, go to the lake, have a foot soak. So, I went downstairs for a while. And when I came back, Gregoire was there with the two children. The children were crying. Gregoire was upset and I thought, "Oh my God, what's happened? What have I done?" And it turned out that Machindranat had fallen down, hit his head. And Gregoire found him crying and was upset because I wasn't there, of course. And so we, I was, you know, we were trying to find what had happened. And when I put my attention at Sahasrara, it felt like, somehow, I got drawn away from the picture. And then this happened, and this happened, and this happened. And some sort of negative attack. And so and that was the story then we saw it. And this was happening while you were working on this baby.
Shri Mataji: You, see there's a saying in Marathi, "Bhitya paathi Brahma rakshas" The one who is all the time frightened, "bhitya", the brahma rakshasas are after, "Bhitya paathi Brahma rakshas". Now if you say anything anymore, you’ll be "bhitya".
[Laughter]
Arnaud: What means "bhitya"?
Sahaja Yogini: It means "beaten".
Warren: Scared, you’ll be.
Shri Mataji: That's all. Just trying to frighten you. Can't you see the game?
Sahaja Yogini: But then we saw, then it seemed like it was like bandits wanting to come into the house. And so they call you away. And then they do their mischief. But then we saw it.
Shri Mataji: So, what is it that Gregoire should understand, first of all. Basically you don't know Gregoire. If I tell you one after another, the history of Mr Gregoire, and he’s ‘bhitya pana’ [unsure], then you will know how many people, one after another. It’s not a question of marriage. His own mother [unclear] Gregoire, another devil. Then came another count he sent. Then came that Jenny, Cherry who’s so ever. Oh! [Laughter]
Gregoire: My aunt.
Shri Mataji: Then came his sisters. One better than the other. Three of them gave us problems. Then his sister-in-law also had a problem. "Bhitya", you see, from rakshas. So, then his wife, then his children now you.

So, one person is having all these experiences. So, there's something wrong with you.
Gregoire: But
Shri Mataji: That is what it is; it’s that you are extremely frightened all the time for nothing at all.

"Shivo ham, Shivo ham, Shivo".
Rustom: Shri Mataji, when you have the Devi Parmeshwari as your Mother, you should not fear anything.
Shri Mataji: That's it. Who are you facing here?

Why it gets cooler, because that "bhityaness" disappears. Nothing can work out with a "bhitya". I tell you, it cannot.
Rustom: You should say that-
Shri Mataji: And so many times I've told Gregoire. And then, you see, he feels hurt and he thinks that, "She has let me down". That's not the point is. That's not the point that he is letting me down. But this nature of fearing, anything I tell you, immediately- you see, there are two bureaucrats. Once I had to face this gentleman, and then that one also. Warren is not a "bhitya". That's something thing, about good about him, thanks God! He is not a "bhitya".
But, you see, he will come out with objections more than solutions, for a long time. Then suddenly, he sees himself. Now he's better.
Like, I was telling him that I can go to Italy. "No Mother. That's a Saturday, Sunday". "No Mother, that is this thing". He would not say, "All right, you go on such and such day", no. Every time he was be telling me, "It’s either Saturday or Sunday. You cannot go on before the first". "This cannot be done". But when should I go he never told me.

Rustom: Gregoire should say-
Shri Mataji: You see the point. The suggestion is all the time about what I cannot do. But what I can do, he never told. It's a fact or not?
Warren: Yes, it’s true Mother.
Shri Mataji: So, I mean, it is much better now. Before it was formidable. So, it's all right.
I have two advisors sitting here.

The second one is Mr Gregoire. He's a "bhitya".
Gregoire: Means a frightened person.
Shri Mataji: No, I mean it's a bureaucratic fright, which is just a thing, takes a form, always. You see, what are these ‘bhoots’ and all that? Nothing but our fears, which takes a form. Like, today, I've got this glass. This must have been in somebody's mind. So, it got a form. In the same way, our fears become the bhoots.
Sahaja Yogini: So, Shri Mataji, this morning, what happened? What was this little drama?
Warren: She just said it, our fears become the bhoots.
Gregoire: But no! Because this morning, I was not afraid before it happened. Something happened.
Shri Mataji: No, no. It is, your fears are there all the time, whether you should marry or not, whether the marriage will be successful. This is the first fear you have. Second, she's also little worried, why?

Because she thinks that the two fears she has, if I may tell you, one is that you are leader and leader's wives are always caught up. Just see, I can read you very well. And the second fear she has is this, that supposing she marries. And then, she's not a successful wife, or she starts behaving the same way as your wife has behaved, because she's little left-sided.
Gregoire: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Then, what to do? Between the two fears, what's going to work out? So, I think you’d better marry Barbara. The solution comes in.
[Laughter]

That’s the best solution!
Warren: That's something to be afraid of!
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: That’s something positive, it is difficult. It is in Akaar, it is in form, already there. Ah! That solves the problem. You go and you might be happy.
Now see the vibrations: is it cool?
[Laughter]

Rustom: The best way, Shri Mataji, to get rid of a mythical fear is to give a real one.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: The best way to get rid of a mythical fear is to give a real one.
Shri Mataji: To get rid of?
Rustom: Of an imaginary fear is to give a real one.
Sahaja Yogini: But Shri Mataji, somehow, we have to face these things isn't it?
Shri Mataji: You’d better [unclear] now, very important. This one is another.
Rustom: [Unclear] they say the mantra of Bhaya Karini.
Shri Mataji: And if the mantra is said in the deeps, in the heart even. What is there when your Mother is here. How many people had this? And Gregoire also, she also knows. How many times I protected them just like that!
Rustom: Shri Mataji-
Shri Mataji: See, the faith is not there!
Rustom: In the West, Shri Mataji, there isn't, there is no tradition of heroism, of facing enormous odds, Shri Mataji, for the sake of the Devi or something. Like, they don't have any-
Shri Mataji: I’m yet to see heroes coming down to me.
Rustom: They don't have anyone like, what’s- this Rani of [unclear], or anyone like this, or Rani of Jhansi. Like that, they don’t have.
