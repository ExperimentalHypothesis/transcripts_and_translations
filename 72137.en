Private conversations in Schwarzsee, 25 August 1986,

PART 1 (uncompleted)

Shri Mataji: Well, you see, he was most satisfied with London.
[Laughter]
He had to go away. He used to say, “Mother, I’ll never go out of London, never”. But in one day, he was completely thrown away.
Did you go after that bathroom? Not yet.
Sahaja Yogi: No, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Your father, he was talking about your father.

It’s a little shake is there. But I feel she’ll be all right, with her Mother herself, she will be all right.
Sahaja Yogi: She’s been sitting, just since we’ve been here, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Sahaja Yogi: Just since you’ve been here with Gregoire, she’s been sitting and starting to crawl and. Just in the last three or four weeks.

Shri Mataji: Never guessed. You want to have some tea yourself?
[About the daughter]
Shri Mataji: She is a South Indian? Yes. With an Indian face.
Sahaja Yogi: I thought Chinese.
Shri Mataji: South India. Ah, will you see this [unclear]. Like mine. She has an Indian face. [Shri Mataji speaks to the baby girl]
We came to see you only. 
[Laughter]
I don’t think there is any problem now, as such, except that a little bit time it takes to adjust, that’s all. I don’t think the way she is sitting, the way she is having, the whole time she has been sitting, you said. Remarkable, isn’t it?

Did you give her calcium?
Sahaja Yogini: We give her white cheese.
No, no. Give her calcium or something. It’s good for her, for bones. Rustom, you can get here some calcium.
Rustom: You get calcium drops for children.
Shri Mataji: Are there calcium drops?
Rustom: Hum. Also vitamin D she should get.
Sahaja Yogini: She has.
Shri Mataji: Vitamin D and calcium.
Rustom: Because there’s not much sun here.

PART 2 (uncompleted)

Warren: I see take the whole floor out and just put a little loft in, like this.
Shri Mataji: The loft, then what’s here? There is also higher loft. So, the height over that is about say 16 feet.
Warren: Oh! At least, Mother.
Shri Mataji: At least.
Sahaja Yogi/Warren: More because actually, your bedroom is about 13 or 14 feet. Actually, without that full ceiling. Then on top of that, there'll be another 9 feet. So, it be 30 it be 25, 20, 23.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, to reach the height, you can’t.
Sahaja Yogi: It will be more or less like this.
Warren: More or less like this. If it was done, it would be more or less, your bedroom would be a little higher than this. Perhaps.
Shri Mataji: I’s already about 8, 9 feet high.
Warren: Yes. There’ll be another foot on this, then the actual projection upwards would be like this. If I can just-
Shri Mataji: No, that’ll be much more, you see, about 8 feet of the height of the roof, plus the top.
Sahaja Yogi: Not 8 feet, Mother. It's about 7 foot the height to the existing ceilings, then on top of that, there's only about 7 feet.
Shri Mataji: So, about 14 feet or plus.
Warren: 14 and 25, 26 feet yes.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, what we can do by changing these [unclear] in my bedroom, a little higher [unclear]

Arnaud: Shri Mataji, one thing interesting about the Japanese people, when you mentioned the Japanese, today, they are just controlling all the financial world and they're just having the Americans on the neck it's absolutely unthinkable.
Sahaja Yogi: That's why this dollar is going down, Mother. England and America are sort of balancing together but Japan's up here. And Germany's up here and Switzerland is not far behind them.
Shri Mataji: Japan is going to be killed by its own inflation. It will be killed by its own inflation; you just don’t worry. You see, in their own country, the currency- to buy, say, what we buy in England for 1 pound, they have to spend 10 pounds, in their own country.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, that’s true.
Shri Mataji: It’ s like, you see. They say there are bricks of gold [Hindi]. In Lanka, there is the gold brick. Because, you see, like the exchange was done with not with rupees, but with gold bricks. One fellow thought he’ll go and earn a lot of money he went down there. And he made in one day, five bricks of gold. He said, "Why you go there? I am going to be rich now ". So next day, he went for his haircut and he had to pay one brick, finished! By the evening, all the bricks were spent out. And he loaned one to someone.
So, in international relationship maybe. But inflation in that country is so high now. If you want to buy a Japanese [unclear] set in Japan, it is 10 times more than in America.
Sahaja Yogi: They have no competition in Japan.
Shri Mataji: It is. Food is so expensive. My nephew was there, food is so expensive, that education so very expensive.
Sahaja Yogi: And housing also Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Housing is so expensive. I mean, it is a horrid place to live in. He could not save a single pai, he resigned now. He resigned from Shipping Corporation, just resign and came back. He just could not manage [unclear]. And he had at least 10 times more paid there.
Just like here. Rustom is telling me that on the average the salary of a person is 6,000 rupees. Our prime minister in India gets 5,000 rupees.
Sahaja Yogi: As a pilot in the Army, he has 6,000. But there are poor people Shri Mataji today. Shri Mataji: And they are poor people.
Sahaja Yogi: They don't have cloth.
Shri Mataji: You see.
Sahaja Yogi: They don't. To buy a single to top, Shri Mataji, for you, it cost them 300 rupees. Sahaja Yogi: It's all relative.
Arnaud: Is it the same here?
Gregoire: So, it is the same here. This artificial wealth is hiding the fact that it's all rubbish.
Shri Mataji: Russians are the wisest of the whole of you, I must say. They are the best.
They have the best of everything and they have got everything that is natural with them. They have gone to the third world, with all natural things to themselves. And they really having a nice time.

They have all beautiful carpets from India, beautiful embroided things, everything is nice. If to their houses, you never think they [unclear]. All the good wood work is with them. Everything they have got. They have exported, you see, all they have accepted because what you call that trade.
Gregoire: Trade barter system.
Shri Mataji: Barter system. The Swiss are very much against it, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah, really?
Sahaja Yogi: Bilateral goods trade.
Shri Mataji: You see and they going to be in trouble. You see, the Swiss are very poor, if you see them, they are very poor [unclear] in goods.
Gregoire: Of, course.
Shri Mataji: Very poor. Rustom, Gregoire. Sadhana had a visitor from Switzerland. And she was really aghast to see Sadhana's ornaments, which were not also, that she was using, not even from the bank [unclear] spoiled in the bank.
Gregoire: But it is true, Shri Mataji, because, you see, people, most people they have what they earn which is enough to carry the day, but they don't have any reserve.
Shri Mataji: You can’t buy anything.
Gregoire: They don't have. Arnaud and myself are good example Shri Mataji.
Sahaja Yogi: You can’t save.
Gregoire: We have.
Shri Mataji: But in America, it’s [unclear].
Gregoire: Thanks to ashram, thanks, I have been saving money since I left my house in Vienna, naturally, because if I live here-
Shri Mataji: You bought a house.
Gregoire: But if I have my own house I can't save the price, Shri Mataji.
Arnaud: Just one example: to move from one town to another town, because we had to go to Geneva, because there was no place no people in Geneva itself for meditation. No Sahaja Yogis, nothing. So we went to Geneva and all thing happened very sahaj, we got this flat for the time being. Just to move, I have to pay 4 to 5,000 Franks more a year, as taxes.
Gregoire: In rupees this is 20,000 rupees.
Arnaud: 20,000 rupees.
Gregoire: To move
Shri Mataji: It’s quite an artificial, this thing is. [Hindi]

[Unclear conversation]

Arnaud: Ashram is the best solution.
Sahaja Yogi: You can't buy property; we found out about that.
Sahaja Yogi: You can’t?
Sahaja Yogi: It's almost impossible to buy a house here.
Sahaja Yogi: Why?
Sahaja Yogi: Because you just pay back interest all the time. You can't pay off the capital because the interest is so high.

Shri Mataji: It’s not 7 feet, it is 8 feet about CP room’s height.
[About a photo] This is my in-law ... and this is my grand-children.
All right?
Sahaja Yogi: Which is, which one?
Shri Mataji: My room is 8 feet. Maybe little more. This could be 7 and half. This is my room, this one is, this is the-

[Conversation about measurements, the plans, low voices]
9:30
Sahaja Yogi: But I don't understand this part
10:26
Shri Mataji: So now, supposing you remove this, it is all together 22 feet. Now to raise this higher, what you have to do,
....
[Many conversations at the same time]

Shri Mataji: So then, this if you can remove, you might get it higher.
Warren: You can take those two big beams out, big beams.
Shri Mataji: Four beams are there. You can put it up there
Warren: Relocate the big beams; and then put that across. From the same, I'm very much in favour of raising the height of your room.
Shri Mataji: Then you need not have it. Because that was the problem that's why we want to open it out. If it is permitted, then we’ll open it out, and it will be outside. But, as it is, if you raise it higher, there is more light.

Warren: In the Red Room in which you slept, there is about a 7-foot space in between. But above your ceiling, there is no space. You don’t have a reinforced ceiling in the Red room where you slept recently. It's about a 7-foot air gap.
Shri Mataji: That was broken.
Warren: But in the room in which you're going to sleep, your own room Mother, there is no gap. Those beams are the things on which the floor of the next ceiling.
Shri Mataji: I don't know why they
Sahaja Yogi: Somehow, they've done it like that. I don't understand it either.

Shri Mataji: You should better, you see [unclear].
Warren: If you look from the back of the house, when you're looking standing out in the garden, you can actually see the two levels change and the windows are at different heights; funny business.
Shri Mataji: We can do like this no problem.
Warren: It would be a good idea.
Shri Mataji: Like this but, it should not be showing in my room.
Warren: No, no. It won't show in your room. It will just make it higher.
Shri Mataji: Then only this problem is that of the height of which two people felt about my room, it is [unclear]. It’s very simple.
Warren: It's easy to achieve in the Red Room in your room we have to actually intrude into the attic.
Shri Mataji: Yes. And then you get the same height, you see.
Warren: Then you can have your chandelier.
Shri Mataji: Hum, then I can have.

Warren: The theory of the ‘watch this point’. He shouldn't go too far with the electricals.
Shri Mataji: In my room, he should forget this lamp. How is it in [unclear]? Nothing will matter in the lower part of it, only when it goes to one part, it is [unclear] part. It is not so difficult. This can be done in one day no problem.

Warren: Only thing, I didn't realize was there was seven and seven, 14 feet, from there to there.
Shri Mataji: No, because you go and stand underneath.
Warren: Yes, I'm with you. From the tippy, tippy top here.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is about 3 feet or four. No, this is about- it comes out as a dog, about 4 feet this one. This is the dog, about 4 feet, on top of that. Of course, seven.
Warren: Yes, correct.
Shri Mataji: Even if you have it up to this, it will be 8 feet height.
But if you going to put them up like that you see, like that and like that.
Warren: Bear them exposed.
Shri Mataji: And he's very anxious that we should put the exposed peace. Let’s see.
Warren: Well, it's a good idea, Mother. It gives the impression of space. You see, here, if you look from here, you can see an example, a perfect example.

It gives the impression of space. This is exactly as the attic is in your house. See those cross beams? I was walking on those beams when I was in the laundry, because there was a ceiling there. Actually, but actually –
[Gregoire speaks to Shri Mataji]

It gives the impression of space. This is exactly as the attic is in your house. See those cross beams? I was walking on those beams when I was in the laundry, because there was a ceiling there. Actually, but actually –
[Gregoire speaks to Shri Mataji]

The projection gives you the impression of space.
Shri Mataji: It’s true. No, these, of course, these are different. But he was saying also the slopy ones. You see, there are two types see there, see now. This one is one, one is, from here it starts, you see? These. Then they go up like that.
Warren: That's right.
Shri Mataji: So, these also, he was saying, should be exposed.
Warren: That's correct, yes. I'm saying that- oh, you're saying even more than this by showing the beans themselves.
Shri Mataji: Not only this, you are talking only about these.
Warren: So, in other words, It’s not lining up, but exposing the beams themselves.
Shri Mataji: No, lining, but between the beams.
Warren: Yes, between that's all right. This is neater and it's less work. This is easier job. The other is a big job because you have to cut lots and lots of little pieces and fit them in. But it doesn't matter.
Shri Mataji: Which is the big one?
Warren: The way you are suggesting, Mother, with the fitting little pieces in.
Shri Mataji: Then we can also put there those glass things.
Warren: Yes. Oh, you can put glass things in these. They've got examples in this house. You can still put the glass panels in, that's no problem.
Shri Mataji: On the top?
Warren: That’s no problem. Even in this house, they've got - I looked out the window - they've got big glass panels running in these houses. I'm surprised they haven't got any here.
Sahaja Yogi: On the other side you mean the window’s top.
Warren: Windows in the roof.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, there’s two.
Warren: In the roof, in the actual roof.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Gregoire: Yes, it’s on the other side.

Shri Mataji: Here if you make a window, it will make it weak, Warren. [unclear]
Warren: In this part, yes.

Shri Mataji: So, you like the exposed beans, Rustom?
Rustom: Exposed beans are fine, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: But looks rustic. So, let us make the upper part rustic. Let us make the children's thing rustic.
Gregoire: It's very cozy, Shri Mataji. If you would like to have a feeling of the place, perhaps you would like to just go up and see. It makes a very cozy feeling.
Shri Mataji: Children like it that's what I’m saying.
Gregoire: Yes.
Rustom: For you, Shri Mataji, I had one idea, that if you have a flat ceiling, it is better for a lady’s rooms.
Shri Mataji: No this is mine. You see, the thing is, [Marathi], raise it, that’s all.

Rustom: Then it’s much better.
Shri Mataji: No this is mine. You see, the thing is, [Marathi],
Rustom: Then it's okay.
Shri Mataji: They can have, they can have a rustic one.

Rustom: When I was a child, Shri Mataji, I used to enjoy these things.
Shri Mataji: Let them have the rustic things. We'll give them everything rustic.
Rustom: Also they’ll feel relaxed, Shri Mataji. Children don't like fussy things.
Warren: The absolutely plain, blank surfaces, they don't like either. Something which has a little change.
Rustom: Yes.
Shri Mataji: All right. We’ll make it rustic.

Rustom: Your ceiling should be well done.
Shri Mataji: Oh, that's all right. My ceiling is done. We are going to raise my ceiling. But then on top, whether to have the rustic- rustic is better.
Sahaja Yogi: If you have an English House of that age, Shri Mataji, certainly the woodwork inside is quite magnificent and strong.
Shri Mataji: They are very good.
Sahaja Yogi: And it is very valuable. It gives a terrific character in English house of that age.
Rustom: The only one could say, Shri Mataji-
Shri Mataji: And also I can get some nice carving, to put on them. It looks very interesting.
Sahaja Yogi: And brass, brass work.
Shri Mataji: [Marathi], we can get things from antics. In India, you get lots of things.

Rustom: You should have good insulation.
Shri Mataji: [Marathi].
Warren: You still have to have some of these cross tiles.
Shri Mataji: That will be part of the scaffolding. But whether the scaffolding should be exposed or not, is the point. Now as we have decided to have a rustic, you see, the get up of the house is majestic and more classical, you see. But the upper part, we can make it rustic.
Lower part is classical. Upper part to be rustic for the children. They like it.

Gregoire: It’s Ekadesha Rudra, Shri Mataji, isn’t it?
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: Ekadesha.
Shri Mataji: Ekadesha. Sahasrara.
Gregoire: Is it this place? Is this Burn’s?
Shri Mataji: No, no, this is the child [unclear]
Have you open my window in my room? You see, I wanted air to come in quite a lot. And oxygen is less, you see, at a height. You have less oxygen. It leaves your rooms closed also. There's no way of getting oxygen inside.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, wider, Shri Mataji. Ruth is very good with windows.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Now, can I ask one question? How much rent do we pay for this apartment?
Sahaja Yogi: It's about uh 2,000 Swiss Francks, a month, Shri Mataji. In pounds it's about,
Shri Mataji: One thousand?
Shri Mataji: 800 pounds a month.
Gregoire: It's not considered as expensive because if it would be in Geneva, it would be the double. Geneva is the most expensive place in Europe.

Guido: Like our Ahsram.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Guido: Like our ashram.
Shri Mataji: Which one?
Guido: Our ashram, in Rome, is nearly the same price of this flat.
Shri Mataji: My house in this thing is so big. You have seen that house now in Diallage [unsure], we are paying 13 hundred pounds.
Gregoire: 13 hundred pounds?
Shri Mataji: 13 hundred pounds.

Guido: We are living 51 people now there. We don't have any more private room, I mean, boys on one side and ladies on the other side. We don't have a husband and wife, we have not there. Because now it's emergency.

Shri Mataji: It's a very good way of doing that house, you see. And that's same style, I'm going to use in this house also, that we make lofts, halfway lofts. So, children can also sleep in the halfway lofts and also the [Unclear].
Waren: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So, there's a halfway loft, I’m going to have this. Like this. It’s very short.
Waren: In the long part of the house, we can put a halfway loft.
Gregoire: Yes. That's so cosy. There is an element of fun also. It’s a Swiss chalet.
Waren: It won't have any much height but it will be good. It will be lovely for the children. Shri Mataji: For children that is fine.
Warren: They can sleep upstairs.
Shri Mataji: Small children can sleep upstairs.
Waren: They can play on the on the lower level. It'll be a miniature of this room.
23:22
Shri Mataji: But you could have like this also if you want to cover. But you don't want to cover, then you can have just that. That would be something like their style, you see the rustic style.
Gregoire: This place, Shri Mataji is- but this is Italy, I would say, Shri Mataji, in Italy the Gruha Lakshmi or the Lakshmi is still there. First of all, the food is extremely good. In every restaurant, you can go, you are sure to get good.
Here, Shri Mataji, it is such to go out for lunch at noon. I have to go because I cannot sit 8 hours in my office, I get crazy. I have to go out but it is such a [unclear] in a restaurant. It's like putting that stuff within yourself. But in Italy, it's completely different. You enjoy eating. There is still something in the food. This is one thing. Then they have a lot of nice things which are not expensive, much more creative. Here for anything, Shri Mataji, you have to pay such a lot. It's ridiculous. A scratch, just a little scratch in the body of the car, costs you, a scratch, cost you 400 Swiss Francs. A scratch! If you have to fix it because of...
Shri Mataji: [Unsure] Yanka is so late to eat, they say so. In Yanka, there is [unclear] That's what it is.

I used to wonder why these ambassadors get such high pay and they have no money. But I don’t know money. Whatever they have got, it is in their own family like, it’s their savings. We too have saved our money not because of any this thing, only because I have been building houses after houses. Otherwise, we would have saved no money.
Gregoire: Because that's the way you regenerate capital.
Shri Mataji: Now CP, he just gets 4,000 pounds.
Gregoire: 4,000?
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: I was getting that, Shri Mataji.
Gregoire: Where? In Saudi Arabia?
Rustom: Hum.
Gregoire: You get 4,000 pounds a month.
Rustom: I used to get it before the riyals [unclear].

Gregoire: You see, Shri Mataji, what I get with a family of three children, is 6,000 Swiss Francs.
Shri Mataji: It's how much pounds.
Rustom That's about 12,000 riyals.
Shri Mataji: For a year?
Rustom: Per month.
Gregoire: No per month.
Sahaja Yogi: 2,400 pounds.
Gregoire: 2,400 per month. It's not a bad salary as such. But with the cost of living, you.
Shri Mataji: But I tell you with 4,000 also. Now see, 1,300 are going into just [unclear] with the thing. Electricity, gas. Our house is a big household, it's not a small household. All the time, we have –
Gregoire: He has no allowances, plus this?
Shri Mataji: I don't know but that's what he told me. I don't know.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, I mean, I don't Know.
Shri Mataji: He might be getting entertainment allows. But that is spend, over spend always from his salary. Now I mean, I just don't know how people can save money.
Gregoire: It's not bad Shri Mataji, because the head of certain agencies have the house provided. His residence is not provided? Because the head of the atomic agency, he has his residence provided.
Shri Mataji: Not anymore. So many people don’t have such things. You see, this fellow had, this UNESCO fellow. And they made such a big thing out of that.
Gregoire: He has a very bad reputation, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Gregoire, you see, it was built before he went. If you want to malice somebody, you can go. How can you go on explaining? This was built in the building itself. The whole building for UNESCO was created. In that, the flat was created for this one. And then when he came, he lived there. But other agencies don't have the house.
