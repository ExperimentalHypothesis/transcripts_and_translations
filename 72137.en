Private conversations in Schwarzsee, 25 August 1986,

PART 1 (uncompleted)

Shri Mataji: Only thing, he was most satisfied with England.
[Laughter]
He had to come away. He used to say, "Mother, I’ll never go out of London, never". But in one day, he was completely thrown away.
Did you go after that bathroom? Not yet.
Sahaja Yogi: No, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You see. [To the baby] "Your father, we are talking about your father ".

It’s a little shake is there. But I feel she’ll be all right, with her Mother herself, she will be all right.
Kingsley: She’s been sitting, just since we’ve been here, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Sahaja Yogi: Just since we’ve been living with Gregoire, she’s been sitting and starting to crawl and. Just in the last three or four weeks.

Shri Mataji: Never guessed. "You want to have some tea yourself?"
[About the baby]
Shri Mataji: She is a Swiss Sahaja Yogini, looking Indian? Yes. With an Indian face.
Sahaja Yogi: She looks Chinese.
Shri Mataji: No Indian. Ah, now you see this forehead. Like mine. She has an Indian face. [Shri Mataji speaks to the baby girl]
We came to see you only. Yes.
[Laughter]

I don’t think there is any problem now, as such, except that a little bit time it takes to adjust, that’s all. I don’t think the way she is sitting, the way she is having, the whole time she has been sitting, you said. Remarkable, isn’t it?

Did you give her calcium?
Sahaja Yogini: We give her white cheese.
Shri Mataji: No, no. Give her calcium or something. It’s good for her, for bones. Rustom, you’ll get here some calcium.
Rustom: You get calcium drops for children.
Shri Mataji: Are there calcium drops?
Rustom: Hum. Also vitamin D she should get.
Sahaja Yogini: She has.
Shri Mataji: Vitamin D and calcium.
Rustom: Because there’s not much sun here.
Shri Mataji: Sun ‘nahi he’ [There is no]. That’s it.

Sahaja Yogi: What’s her name, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: I forgot.
Gregoire: Radhika.
Shri Mataji: Hum? Radhika, yes. You see, she had a back damage once and I was quite discouraged. But it was from her bhoots. She came looking at the eclipse. And she had two twins in her.

Rustom: I remember in Vienna.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: I was there.
Shri Mataji: And little of weakness come on [unclear] a little bit effect, very little.
Rustom: You had twins.
Sahaja Yogini: Now the twins went.
Kingsley: But it was so silly, Shri Mataji, because we have had actually never seen an eclipse before. And we were sitting in the car, and I said to Ruth, "It’s a cloudy night tonight".
Shri Mataji: Ha.
Kingsley: And then we noticed that all the stars were in the sky. And we said, "Well, what is that?" I mean, we actually hadn’t seen an eclipse Shri Mataji. And then were wondering what it must be?
Shri Mataji: Really?
Kingsley: Yes. Well, if you live in a town all your life, I suppose.
Shri Mataji: Thanks God that you recognized the Moon.
[Laughter].

You don’t know the story of Sadarji [chief] is, that one Sadarji was going; it was setting sun, you see. So, he said, "Is this a sun or a moon?" Another Sadarji came. He said, "That’s an [unclear] it’s a moon and a sun". He said, "I don’t know maybe. Maybe it’s a moon". He said, "No, I created a sun". [unclear] Third one came. "What do you think, is this a sun or a moon?" He said, "I’m sorry, I am a foreigner".
[Laughter].

Rustom: There’s another story, same style, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: There’s another story, the same style. We have two Sadarjis fighting, you see. One is saying, "The Sun is setting in the East". The other one is saying, "The Sun is setting in the West". And then the same story, a third Sadarji comes;
Shri Mataji: Daddies have been doing, made such a fun out of it. Now they are having a nice time.
[Laughter].
Rustom: Before, they were the ones who killed Pakistanis. Now the Pakistanis are supporting them.
Shri Mataji: Stupid fellows.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I think she’s all right. The bones are, they are saying, a little bit at pelvic.
Rustom: Yes, I know.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Rustom: A little lose.
Shri Mataji: They have turned inside sort of. It’s going to be [unclear].
Rustom: It’s very easy to treat it.

Shri Mataji: Hello! [To the baby] Are you eating that?
[Unclear conversation]
Rustom: You see, Shri Mataji, when they are born, the capsule of the hip joint is very shallow. So, it is very easy for the bone to move out.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Rustom: Ji [Yes].
Shri Mataji: But it is due to eclipse sight.
Rustom: Yes, and Swadisthana, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Eclipse, [unclear] this is born with the Moon.
Rustom: Also, one time I remember, Shri Mataji, Ruth had some pain in [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Sun eclipse, mentally derangement [unclear] if you see the Sun eclipse. You saw the Moon.
Ruth: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Sun eclipse gives you a mental derangement. I wish people knew all this. But it is to be understood. After all, when there is Moon in the sky, you see the waves of the- even the waves of the ocean change. So, how can it not have an effect on us? It has on, even on the matter.
This is wisdom. You understand that mister?

You like it very much. Ah! That’s new. What is it?
Kingsley: It’s apple and plum and a little mango and [unclear] sweets.
Shri Mataji: Apple and plum, and boiled together, is it?
Kingsley: No, Shri Mataji, just liquidized.
Shri Mataji: Liquidized. Less sugar.
Kingsley: No, no sugar, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Little sugar would be good. Little.
Now these days, the apples are so insipid here. I was surprised, the fruits are so insipid, absolutely. You get better apples in India than here. It’s really surprising.

And nowadays, I don't know what has happened to India. All kinds of foods, you get everywhere. Otherwise, in the beginning, I remember, while we didn’t even quite wait till we were married, and even after that, we never got apples in Nagpur or Puna or Bombay. Bombay, a little bit, but not in the [unclear]. Only in Delhi we used to get. But now you get in Nagpur, Central in Delhi.
Rustom: Apples everywhere.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: And apples everywhere.
Shri Mataji: Yes!
Rustom: I used to transport. Transport, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You used to transport.
Rustom: Nowadays, they transport them from Kashmir .
Shri Mataji: But this is some sort of a big venture, because normally, we never used to see big Now Rajesh is going to start a company with Jalan, for juices, fresh juices. [unclear]. Because now such a production has started in India- juices. And actually, nowhere you get really, really, good juices in the world. They're all sort of over chemicalized.
Gregoire: They have good apple juices here.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: They have good apple juices here.
Shri Mataji: Apple juices are good.
Gregoire: Yes. Depends which one, some are very good.
[Shri Mataji is drinking tea]
Shri Mataji: It’s good apple juice.
Rustom: So many there.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: She wants some more.
Shri Mataji: She likes the food, yes?
Sahaja Yogi: She loves food.
Gregoire: She's very intense in her attention.

At least, 80 percent children, as today, I saw. I would say they were quite all right. One or two were-
Gregoire: Guido, Shri Mataji speaks to you.
Shri Mataji: So, I mean for the children that I saw, 80% were all right, quite good. I would say quite good. Not excellent, some were excellent, but 80%. But two or three small, small children were possessed. They couldn't see me, you see. When they saw me, they were somewhere else. They couldn't see me.
It's Lakshmi I am worried about [unclear]. Her daughter Lakshmi. She’s quite a big girl. But I remember when we went [unclear]. She had been just born or something.
Warren: But you mean Ruth and that one from England, Mother.
