Private conversations in Schwarzsee, 25 August 1986.

PART 1 (uncompleted) Lunch time.

Shri Mataji: Only thing, he was most satisfied with England.
[Laughter]
He had to come away. He used to say, "Mother, I’ll never go out of London, never". But in one day, he was completely thrown away.
Did you go after that bathroom? Not yet.
Sahaja Yogi: No, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You see. [To the baby] "Your father, we are talking about your father ".

It’s a little shake is there. But I feel she’ll be all right, with her Mother herself, she will be all right.
Kingsley: She’s been sitting, just since we’ve been here, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Sahaja Yogi: Just since we’ve been living with Gregoire, she’s been sitting and starting to crawl and. Just in the last three or four weeks.

Shri Mataji: Never guessed. "You want to have some tea yourself?"
[About the baby]
Shri Mataji: She is a Swiss Sahaja Yogini, looking Indian? Yes. With an Indian face.
Sahaja Yogi: She looks Chinese.
Shri Mataji: No Indian. Ah, now you see this forehead. Like mine. She has an Indian face. [Shri Mataji speaks to the baby girl]
We came to see you only. Yes.
[Laughter]

I don’t think there is any problem now, as such, except that a little bit time it takes to adjust, that’s all. I don’t think the way she is sitting, the way she is having, the whole time she has been sitting, you said. Remarkable, isn’t it?

Did you give her calcium?
Sahaja Yogini: We give her white cheese.
Shri Mataji: No, no. Give her calcium or something. It’s good for her, for bones. Rustom, you’ll get here some calcium.
Rustom: You get calcium drops for children.
Shri Mataji: Are there calcium drops?
Rustom: Hum. Also vitamin D she should get.
Sahaja Yogini: She has.
Shri Mataji: Vitamin D and calcium.
Rustom: Because there’s not much sun here.
Shri Mataji: Sun ‘nahi he’ [There is no]. That’s it.

Sahaja Yogi: What’s her name, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: I forgot.
Gregoire: Radhika.
Shri Mataji: Hum? Radhika, yes. You see, she had a back damage once and I was quite discouraged. But it was from her bhoots. She came looking at the eclipse. And she had two twins in her.

Rustom: I remember in Vienna.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: I was there.
Shri Mataji: And little of weakness come on [unclear] a little bit effect, very little.
Rustom: You had twins.
Sahaja Yogini: Now the twins went.
Kingsley: But it was so silly, Shri Mataji, because we have had actually never seen an eclipse before. And we were sitting in the car, and I said to Ruth, "It’s a cloudy night tonight".
Shri Mataji: Ha.
Kingsley: And then we noticed that all the stars were in the sky. And we said, "Well, what is that?" I mean, we actually hadn’t seen an eclipse Shri Mataji. And then were wondering what it must be?
Shri Mataji: Really?
Kingsley: Yes. Well, if you live in a town all your life, I suppose.
Shri Mataji: Thanks God that you recognized the Moon.
[Laughter].

You don’t know the story of Sadarji [chief] is, that one Sadarji was going; it was setting sun, you see. So, he said, "Is this a sun or a moon?" Another Sadarji came. He said, "That’s an [unclear] it’s a moon and a sun". He said, "I don’t know maybe. Maybe it’s a moon". He said, "No, I created a sun". [unclear] Third one came. "What do you think, is this a sun or a moon?" He said, "I’m sorry, I am a foreigner".
[Laughter].

Rustom: There’s another story, same style, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: There’s another story, the same style. We have two Sadarjis fighting, you see. One is saying, "The Sun is setting in the East". The other one is saying, "The Sun is setting in the West". And then the same story, a third Sadarji comes;
Shri Mataji: Daddies have been doing, made such a fun out of it. Now they are having a nice time.
[Laughter].
Rustom: Before, they were the ones who killed Pakistanis. Now the Pakistanis are supporting them.
Shri Mataji: Stupid fellows.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I think she’s all right. The bones are, they are saying, a little bit at pelvic.
Rustom: Yes, I know.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Rustom: A little lose.
Shri Mataji: They have turned inside sort of. It’s going to be [unclear].
Rustom: It’s very easy to treat it.

Shri Mataji: Hello! [To the baby] Are you eating that?
[Unclear conversation]
Rustom: You see, Shri Mataji, when they are born, the capsule of the hip joint is very shallow. So, it is very easy for the bone to move out.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Rustom: Ji [Yes].
Shri Mataji: But it is due to eclipse sight.
Rustom: Yes, and Swadisthana, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Eclipse, [unclear] this is born with the Moon.
Rustom: Also, one time I remember, Shri Mataji, Ruth had some pain in [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Sun eclipse, mentally derangement [unclear] if you see the Sun eclipse. You saw the Moon.
Ruth: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Sun eclipse gives you a mental derangement. I wish people knew all this. But it is to be understood. After all, when there is Moon in the sky, you see the waves of the- even the waves of the ocean change. So, how can it not have an effect on us? It has on, even on the matter.
This is wisdom. You understand that mister?

You like it very much. Ah! That’s new. What is it?
Kingsley: It’s apple and plum and a little mango and [unclear] sweets.
Shri Mataji: Apple and plum, and boiled together, is it?
Kingsley: No, Shri Mataji, just liquidized.
Shri Mataji: Liquidized. Less sugar.
Kingsley: No, no sugar, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Little sugar would be good. Little.
Now these days, the apples are so insipid here. I was surprised, the fruits are so insipid, absolutely. You get better apples in India than here. It’s really surprising.

And nowadays, I don't know what has happened to India. All kinds of foods, you get everywhere. Otherwise, in the beginning, I remember, while we didn’t even quite wait till we were married, and even after that, we never got apples in Nagpur or Puna or Bombay. Bombay, a little bit, but not in the [unclear]. Only in Delhi we used to get. But now you get in Nagpur, Central in Delhi.
Rustom: Apples everywhere.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: And apples everywhere.
Shri Mataji: Yes!
Rustom: I used to transport. Transport, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You used to transport.
Rustom: Nowadays, they transport them from Kashmir .
Shri Mataji: But this is some sort of a big venture, because normally, we never used to see big Now Rajesh is going to start a company with Jalan, for juices, fresh juices. [unclear]. Because now such a production has started in India- juices. And actually, nowhere you get really, really, good juices in the world. They're all sort of over chemicalized.
Gregoire: They have good apple juices here.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: They have good apple juices here.
Shri Mataji: Apple juices are good.
Gregoire: Yes. Depends which one, some are very good.
[Shri Mataji is drinking tea]
Shri Mataji: It’s good apple juice.
Rustom: So many there.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: She wants some more.
Shri Mataji: She likes the food, yes?
Sahaja Yogi: She loves food.
Gregoire: She's very intense in her attention.

At least, 80 percent children, as today, I saw. I would say they were quite all right. One or two were-
Gregoire: Guido, Shri Mataji speaks to you.
Shri Mataji: So, I mean for the children that I saw, 80% were all right, quite good. I would say quite good. Not excellent, some were excellent, but 80%. But two or three small, small children were possessed. They couldn't see me, you see. When they saw me, they were somewhere else. They couldn't see me.
It's Lakshmi I am worried about [unclear]. Her daughter Lakshmi. She’s quite a big girl. But I remember when we went [unclear]. She had been just born or something.
Warren: But you mean Ruth and that one from England, Mother.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear].
Warren: Tara's child.
Shri Mataji: Oh.
Warren: Ruth's child is Lakshmi also, Ruth from Bristol.
Shri Mataji: But she's all right, she's very sweet, all right. She's very sweet. But maybe Tara doesn't come to the collective. I’ve seen the [unclear] child for the first time. That's the one that is a bit worrying me. Then there's another child, I don't know whose it is, could not look at me.
Warren: Is that Shaun’s wife?
Arnaud: No, it is not Shri Mataji. He is a Swiss boy, he has red hair. When you came to him, just before going in the car, he turned back to you.
Shri Mataji: Ah. Who is he?
Arnaud: What is his name Maria?
Maria: Shridhara.
Arnaud: Shridhara.
Shri Mataji: Shridhara.
Arnaud: It's the second son, it is the grandson of this Magda.
Shri Mataji: Vaikuntha is now all right. He all right.
Arnaud: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Shridhara will be all right after some time. I think so. Vaikuntha. Vaikuntha was good. I remember that. He had given him a drum. So, he was beating the drum all over and telling all the trees, "Shri Mataji comes, Mataji comes to give Realisation". So much so, she said, "She is telling all the trees, everything". [Marathi?]

The whole day, she is like that.
Kingsley: Most particularly, after she's eaten, Shri Mataji. She is particularly very happy after she's eaten.
[Laughter] Like her daddy.
Shri Mataji: You like more your Daddy or Mommy tell me.

It's a fly, is it? In the systematic country, how good they allow a fly do this?
[Laughter]
They are over systematic, aren’t they? Worse are the Germans. They are very systematic- over.
[Marathi?]

Rustom: What it is, Shri Mataji, is that when you are always systematic, then you don't have time or energy to think about anything else. So you can forget God.
Shri Mataji: No, but then you become Ravana, sort of, absolutely abnormal. You become like stone.
But you see, as the main thing is that supposing, you do not think about something. But being acts and that's why they become cruel people. Being acts because being has got all these things within itself. It acts just like, say, heat. Heat will act. It doesn't think but it acts.
Rustom: So being has cruelty in its nature.
Rustom: Hum?
Rustom: Being has cruelty with it.
Rustom: Ah. Anything, I mean, you see, supposing any matter is there, it will act the way it is. If there is steel, it will act like steel. If it is, say, stone. It will act like stone. It cannot act like something else and it cannot do anything about it. It cannot use anything for itself, nothing. Just acts whatever it has, you see, automatic. That's an automatism build in.
Even animals, you see ,cannot act like something else, normally. Unless and until there are in connection with human beings. They do not know. Because animals, whatever is it, say, if it is an elephant, it will remain elephant. Horse will remain horse, act the same way. The scorpion will act the way the scorpion, they will not act like the same, you see.

So, only the human beings can act like whatever they like. They are always. And how? Because they can think. Beyond the thinking, when you go through Sahaja Yoga, then what happens, that you become in charge of all these things. And you start into it: in charge. The first stage is this, where you are a human being.

I always give the example of this motorcar and the driver. An accelerator and a break. You start using accelerator and a break, till you reach a point, where you start knowing how to use both automatically. That is dharma, that is balance. At that time, you are a human being.
Then you become a driver of yourself.
But when you become Realized, what happens that you within yourself start witnessing the driver in you, the accelerator within you, and also with them. So, you yourself become in charge. You become the master of these things. That's what Realization is.
Like there is heat within us, all right? There is anger, there is this, that, all those things are within us. When you become a human being, you start knowing there is anger, there is temper, this is this, that. Then when you get into dharma, then you start using properly that balance where to get angry, where not to get angry, what to do, this is my dharma, this is my wife, this is my husband, this, that.

After that, in the second stage, what happens that you go beyond all this. They do not exist in you in a way that they over power you, that you have to control them. But you start controlling. Not only in the sense whenever you want you get angry, whenever you want to get into another mood, whatever you want, you’ll do. You become dharmatit.

Rustom: Shri Mataji, this word ‘being’ how is it translated in Sanskrit? ‘Bhavanam’ or?
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: This word ‘being’.
Shri Mataji: BE-ING.
Rustom: Because in English, one cannot understand exactly how to translate.
Shri Mataji: You see, that is called ‘vyashti’.
Rustom: ‘Vyashti’.
Shri Mataji: ‘Vyashti’.Or also called in a very, very, [unclear] vyakti.
Rustom: ‘Vyashti’. A bit manifestation.
Shri Mataji: ‘Vyashti’and sushti.
Rustom: ‘Sushti’.
Shri Mataji: ‘Vyashti’and ‘sushti’. ST.
Rustom: ST.

Shri Mataji: A ‘Vyakti’ becomes a ‘Vyashti’ when he is Realized soul.
Rustom: Acha.
Shri Mataji: All right?
Or, in English language, they call it personality [vyaktit]?
Rustom: In English language, there is no word for these things, Shri Mataji. In US, you can come to English ‘manifestation’; manifested [vyakta] actually.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Gregoire: The philosophers have used the word ‘being’ as synonymous to existence, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: ‘Being’ is personality.
Rustom: ‘Being’ is not synonymous. Yes, it's personality, if you want, but it's not synonymous with existence.
Rustom: ‘Being’ comes out of existence.
Shri Mataji: Let’s put it as ‘being’ is [unclear].
Rustom: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: [Unclear].
Rustom: That also comes from the root to manifest, to come into existence.
Shri Mataji: Yes, manifest. [Unclear]. The principle that is manifested is the being.
Rustom: And the root of manifestation is existence.
Shri Mataji: So, this is [unclear].
Rustom: Yes.

The [unclear] for that is bhavan, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Bhavan means created. Bhavan, whatever is created. Bhava. I'm not such a master in Sanskrit as you are, you must know.
Rustom: The name of the Devi is Bhavani. Same root.
Shri Mataji: Because she's the creator.
Rustom: That’s right, you are the base and the [unclear].

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] they have discovered about the Devi, surprising, like spice.
Rustom: There’s one name of the Devi, Bhava Bhaya Harini.
Shri Mataji: Bhava Bhaya Harini. Bhava is whatever is created and whatever fear we have out of the created.
Rustom: She removes it.
Shri Mataji: So, the created is this world, and the Bhaya of the created, that is Bhaya of this world. Harini is the one who takes away.
Rustom: She sang that, that Devi [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Bhava Bhaya Harini.

She is looking at new faces but she doesn't feel funny with new people. She likes it.
Warren has a speciality for children. Really, they take to him so easily.
[Marathi?]
Rustom: We’re calling [unclear]?
Shri Mataji: No, we don’t. This little child has [unclear]. What will happen to the baby? I’m thinking about it. So, we will look after the baby, you think?
Arnaud: Shri Mataji-
Shri Mataji: She doesn't go for work?
Arnaud: For the time being, she is going to work. But she has started a job. So, I don't know the time being. I didn't think of it, just in my mind, when I propose that.
That would be the ideal person because she's a sweet person. But she's going to stop in any case to work, Shri Mataji. So maybe it would be a good thing.

Warren: Shri Mataji, Marie-Laure is still breastfeeding completely, 100%.
Shri Mataji: Really? Why?
Warren: That's a good question. I agree
Shri Mataji: It’s a very systematically when you are bringing up the child.
Warren: Oh it's a big thing Mother that you should, in the West, completely breastfeed your baby until it's about 14 or 15 months, at least.
Shri Mataji: During ten months in India also they do, but I mean, we are very different mothers, but not completely.

[Massaging a baby?]

Shri Mataji: So hard to see. And curing a child is much more sickening. The child is crying all the time, trying to sort of- horrible it is. Better cure hundred lepers than to cure a child. Horrible.
It's all right if the child has some physical problem, but these mental children are really beyond me. They just go on crying, crying, crying, crying.
And what are we to do? We'll be having one for the children, like Guido is having. I think we should help him internationally; don't you think so?
We have money, let us give it to them.
Rustom: Even if every Center gives a hundred pounds a month, it’s more than enough [unsure].
Shri Mataji: More. That’s good. It’s quite a lot.
So, that's why this international thing should be established, it’s better. That way, if you have international, in the week, they look after all the schools, the payment, the education and all that. And pour Guido gets nothing out of it.

So, one school like this, where there could be a creche, like you can say, not creche, but it is from two years to five years, all right. Like we have worked for Guido. Another school could be from five to - what is the, what is the primary is five to?
Guido: Ten.
Shri Mataji: Ten, all right.
Guido: Five to ten.
Shri Mataji: Five to ten. So, one school from five to ten and one school from ten to sixteen. All right.
Now what I just don’t know, that the children who are born with mental problems, what should be about? They cannot be mixed up with other children. For example, this Anand, we should try - I told them to send him away.
[Unclear]

He's very bad; if Bhavani doesn't want, let her go. But what to do about these children?

For those who suffer from mentally handicapped, mentally handicapped. Gregoire, what is your suggestion?
Rustom: You can have a special asylum for these children.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: A special place for these mentally disturbed children. So, they won't disturb the normal children.
Shri Mataji: Children of Sahaja Yogis only.
Rustom: Sahaja Yogis who are mentally disturbed.

Shri Mataji: But that responsibility should be of the parents.
Rustom: They are so hopeless, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Otherwise, they will neither bother to clear themselves out or to be all right.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, I'm not making any suggestion, Shri Mataji. But let's face it, I mean, there are a lot of- I mean a child like this Inès or Shalini, is she [more] worth of it or not, than a normal child from non-Sahaja Yogi, who don't meditate, who don't worship? I don't know.
Shri Mataji: She's absolutely a gone case. She’s not a normal child.
Gregoire: So, the answer is yes. But that means that Sahaja Yoga children are, of course, more attacked than normal children of non-Sahaja Yogi, because negativity wants to finish them off. While negativity is not interested in normal children. I think, if we face it, this is the truth.
Shri Mataji: Which one?
Gregoire: It means that I disagree with the idea of having an asylum for children because that would give us a very bad name. An asylum for Sahaja Yoga children and we are supposed –
Shri Mataji: No, I would say, start it the other way round. Let us see if there are some children like that, and if they don't improve, the parents, let them go out of Sahaja Yoga, work it out, put their children all right, get better.

Gregoire: Put their children where, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Right.
Warren: Like Graham and Gael did in a way. They went out of Sahaja Yoga for about 6 months, and everything got better.
Gregoire: You see, I think this is very interesting because sometimes it looks like these children, like us, have just a nuisance value for the bhoot. If the negativity can go to Sahaja Yoga or if the negativity can go to you, then they'll really be happy and they'll stick on.
Warren: It puts the responsibility back where it belongs, with the parents.
Shri Mataji: No, this is one solution, I don’t know. We have to ask such parents to go out of Sahaja Yoga, to get their children treated first. Then they will have intensive time for their children to get better.
Warren: Leaving it to somebody else is an escape for your own problems.
Gregoire: This would mean Shri Mataji, that if the children don't improve, in an ashram like Guido’s, they should go back to their parents, and in turn, the parents should be asked to leave the collectivity. Is that so?
Shri Mataji: I think so. What do you say?
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji, it seems so.
Shri Mataji: They are to be a permanent liability with their parents.
Gregoire: Because if it comes to a point where these children are vectors, really vectors of attacks against Sahaja Yoga.
Shri Mataji: And also their parents are, in the way. I would say, because now in this case, that boy, you see, Simon is a very hard fellow. I told him that, "You give up your ego. If you don't give up your ego your child will go and separate [unsure]". I had cured the child. Again the child is not cured. He is still going on with this [unclear].
Gregoire: The difficult situation, Shri Mataji, is when you have a good member of a couple and a bad one, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

Warren: That's okay; let them work it.
Gregoire: Hum?
Warren: Let them work it out outside. The good one will be good and the bad one will come up.

Shri Mataji: You have to make a stop somewhere, somehow, for this negativity not to crawl into us. Because, you see, it will make us very weak, that's all. I mean, name, I don't care much because I'm Nishkalanka. But otherwise.
Gregoire: That was a bureaucrat’s reaction, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: I know. Bureaucrats always think about the [unclear] they have, towards names.
Which bureaucrat has a good name? I don't know.

Gregoire: Would India be the solution?
Shri Mataji: You mean what? In that school, we can't have mentally handicapped children. That's one thing for sure. You see, that school will start at the age of 10 years or 9 years for children. We can't, I mean, have handicapped children attached to that, you see. Because, as it is, handicapped children are bhootish. But we can have an organization or such, where we pay the people who can look after these in very healthy circumstances. And put these children there. It can be solved, can be. But it should not be our liability. What I feel, if we consider everything, whatever junk they bring with them, it becomes our liability. Only thing, that they once attend my program, finished. Ask them, "What have you done for Sahaja Yoga?" Nothing.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji, this is really- I mean, yes absolutely.

Shri Mataji: Well, I think the parents, as we were treating people for themselves. Supposing somebody was not good. We used to ask to him get out of Sahaja Yoga.
In the same way, they go.
Sahaja Yogi: We should do the same.
Warren: And Mother, surprisingly, that's exactly the news they want to hear. Most of these people are very pleased to think that for a time they have to go out and get well.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Warren: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Who?
Warren: Well, what my experience is that if you tell somebody you go out of Sahaja Yoga, you go out of the collectivity, where you can trouble other Sahaja Yogis, and therefore trouble Mother, if you go out on your own, you're in the direct attention of Shri Mataji and you'll get better. And the bhoots can't trouble the collectivity or Mother. And they accept that and they act on it.

Shri Mataji: They won’t be happy thought. No, that's not true. It would give me the shock of my life. Why would they be happy?
Warren: They are not happy Mother, they accept it.
Rustom: They are relieved for us.
Warren: They are relieved.
Shri Mataji: That’s why they say they are relieved. No but they did not. Like, we are asked Barbara to go out. "Why?" She jumped back on me, letters after letters, "Magda, how many letters this Martha wrote to me? I have nothing against him " I have nothing- this thing, that thing. "Mother, I would like to go back ". You have no idea so many letters she wrote to me. Letters after letter. Even in India she sent me letters.

Gregoire: We have to find some way that this process of becoming a nuisance value to Sahaja Yoga activates the medium capacity of people. There is a kind of process like this. The more we do,
Shri Mataji: The more they are.
Gregoire: The more they are interested.
Shri Mataji: That’s what I am saying. It’s a conclusion I don't think how many will be happy. Why? Terrence, we ask him to get out. You see, Terrence, is a horrible fellow. Oh, he made such a big ‘tamasa’ [unsure]. He came down.
Warren: It's not being thrown out of Sahaja Yoga, Mother. It's seen as a treat. I don't mean to be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga. But I mean, see it as a positive treatment. See it as a positive form of getting you better. It's not that we're throwing them out at all. Go out of Sahaja Yoga, they understand where they can't trouble the collectivity and they can't trouble you. They understand this point.

Shri Mataji: They don’t. I don’t think they understand the life [unclear].
Even this Gael and Graham, they are very unhappy.
Warren: All right, unhappy but they did it, though.
Shri Mataji: Well, they were very angry, unhappy [unclear].
Warren: It should only be used in very few cases. I'm not advocating widely, but there are only a few cases, from time to time.
Gregoire: Yes, but for instance, this is not the absolute. I mean, of course, what you are saying is something we practice in quite some [unclear]. In the case of Magda, for instance, and that I go back to the case now of Badra, because it's going to become actual heat.
Shri Mataji: Who?
Gregoire: Badra, Hugo’s wife.
Shri Mataji: Badra?
Warren: Barbara.
Gregoire: Barbara, just speaking about her, she's already in my left heart. Shri Mataji, these are people we tell them to go, they go one month, two months, Barbara was each time in Vienna. Then she came back.
Shri Mataji: But why she doesn't go out of Sahaja Yoga? But she goes where?
Gregoire: No, ok. But Magda is a better example. Arnaud asked Magda to leave Sahaja Yoga and she was out. She wrote all these letters. Then she came back.
Shri Mataji: Just the same.
Gregoire: And she is just the same!
Warren: Yes but that's- we're talking about the children, whether there's an interest in a born Realized child would be.
Gregoire: Yes, no. I'm no more thinking about children because-
Shri Mataji: Then if we think it will be acceptable, then we you can try, acceptable even it is.
But they should not start hitting the child for that.
Warren: Yes, I agree Mother.
Gregoire: Yes, so sorry. I think we had widened the discussion if we speak only about the child, I don't know. I didn't answer your question. I don't know what is to be done.
Shri Mataji: If a child is born, born all right and [unclear] the parents if the child is back, then we should ask the parents to leave.

Gregoire: I have the very concrete example of Phil and Marie-Laure now before me.
Phil is a very active person in the little group that we are. I would have difficulty to ask him to leave Sahaja Yoga. I think it would be very bad for the couple and for the married life if I asked him to live the collectivity because his child is possessed because of his wife.
Shri Mataji: And then what?
Gregoire: I don't know Shri Mataji.
Warren: I disagree with you. I think that objectively, it would work. I know you're a little more involved but-
Gregoire: No, I'm not involved.
Shri Mataji: Maybe you try, worth trying. Ask both of them to get out. Ask him also that, "You try to treat your wife, and now you stand up on your legs. Treat her like a wife, you know this is good ".
Gregoire: And leave the ashram.
Shri Mataji: Hum? And leave the ashram, yes.
Gregoire: OK.
Shri Mataji: And don't come to any programs.
Gregoire: Phil also.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: Also Phil does not come to any programs.
Shri Mataji: Yes. Let her work it out.
Warren: And he'll be assiduous about it and-
Gregoire: Yes, yes.
Sahaja Yogini: Very good incentive.

Warren: Very good incentive.
Shri Mataji: But he must call us about it.
Warren: And a good incentive -
Shri Mataji: A person like Phil would be very incentive.
Gregoire: Yes, because he's not so much, he's not so much bothered about it. I mean, I don't think he has worked on his wife.
Warren: And for him three months-
Shri Mataji: Yes, he doesn’t bother.
Gregoire: He's floating somewhere, but he does not-
Shri Mataji: Well he thinks she's formidable.
Gregoire: Yes.
Shri Mataji: He thinks she's formidable.
Warren: I mean you tell a good person like Phil; you explain what you're doing. You take them into your confidence and you say, "OK, now it's over to you". And-
Gregoire: But now there is another- OK, this is one possibility.

Shri Mataji: Hum. Better try.
Gregoire: But we, OK. But then we jump a step. Because we have not gone through the step where the baby is given to somebody else and has improved.
Warren: That's true.
Gregoire: We are jumping a step there.
Shri Mataji: No, no. That step one should take, it’s possibly. But now, in their case, we can, because such a small child.
Gregoire: All right.
Shri Mataji: In their case, we can.

That small child was very difficult. I don’t know. Very bad, very bad conditions. How badly caught up.

Arnaud: As soon as, as soon as it was presented.
Warren: See, it’s a classic example of the interim phase is your child. That's where the child is getting better as a result of the nurturing of Guido's work. That we hope would work-
Shri Mataji: That is, you see, that age is better. That’s a different age we are talking about.

Or another moderate way could be that allow the child to grow with the same parents. Better give them alternatives. We don't do anything about the child, until the child is to years. But then we’ll have to open, I don't want Guido to do this.
Gregoire: No, no. But Shri Mataji, this I really thank you, because it's- that's the way the negativity is going to work. I mean, I'm sure he's trying to do a really reasonable job, and he's working. And then three or four completely mad children are coming and that blows the heart up.
Warren: For extreme cases, let's try that.
Gregoire: The argument of wellness is something which is very sound [unsure] for Sahaja Yoga is not responsible. This is one thing.
[Cut in the audio at 45:49]

Shri Mataji: Then we might have plastic. We might have another kind, you.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, also, in my ignorance, there is another point where I'm unsure is in which case physical movement helps, in which case it doesn't. Because if the bhoots are local, identified with a place, then sending someone for instance to Australia should help or vice versa. Like it seems that something standing, it has worked for adults, at least. I mean Jame's wife was a good example. She crossed those three oceans and she became very good in relatively short time.
Shri Mataji: On, I know. Let’s say not only by transferring us. You see what happened with her, she was starting thinking that she is the owner of the place itself. She can rule people and that as she has children in [unclear] and all that, she is sort of , I mean, in charge with [unclear].

And in that situation, she behaved in a funny manner. But as soon that she realized that she would be thrown away, that shocked her actually. It's not so much of the transference as you think is. She was not so ‘bhootish’ as you think. She was egoistical. She was like, more like, rigid. So the shock, you see, that she'll be losing this position- Brigit, we can put her right tomorrow [unsure]- as soon as we tell her that, "You have to go away from here, somewhere else" she will be all right too.
Warren: Even saying that she can't go to Shudy Camps will give her a hell of a shock.
Shri Mataji: Itself has done some good. Because her children improved a lot, their health improved a lot. Their appetite opened. She was very happy in Shudy Camps.

Warren: There's another point to this, Mother, this is how it happens in India especially in Bombay and Puna. As soon as there is a problem, they get sent out. And before too long, they're back again.
Shri Mataji: For that, you have somebody like Modi.
Warren: But they come back, Mother. I've seen it. With my own eyes, I've seen it.

Shri Mataji: You see, there is one difference, when I think about Indians. You are a very naïve people.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji-
Shri Mataji: You see, there, Gregoire, it's a different.
Gregoire: We don't-
Shri Mataji: To them, to them, you see, to get possessed is worse than leprosy.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji we don't see. Nobody I mean, this Inès business is the big news of the day. That's the only thing that Phil said. He said, "I didn't notice that she was". No, but I mean I have been in grief [unsure] for quite some time. And I work in my own ways. Because I cannot focus on a child and say, "He's possessed". And I think very few people have that capacity in Sahaja Yoga. So before we- 49:04
Shri Mataji: It's a difference. You are very naïve [unclear] are different. You live with such mundane things, such gross things. I mean, all the time you are busy, which side of the chair somebody should seat, sort of a nonsense, you see. The subtler things, you don’t know. That's why it's such a problem! Now you have all your dead bodies buried in a church. It’s such a lunatic asylum now in the city. Now you are going to open out a lunatic asylum. What is going to happen to your children?
Gregoire: They go to-
Shri Mataji: I mean nobody, no Indians will send once; supposing I really tell them that they have opened out a lunatic asylum and lunatics are running about, Indians will run out. Actually, half of them will disappear. Really!

These all Gujaratis will bundle off it, I tell you, they did not notice that [unsure]. It’s like lepers being let loose. You see, what happened, our house in Lucknow, not even on rent. And there, the people, there was one party, that they had taken the big house. They [unclear]. But the one who were living up there, without paying any rent, they were saying that, "We just look after the house, you give us the house" and all that. A friend of one of my relations was staying up there. There is a small flat. He would not leave. And we- another party which wanted to take it on rent, did not take it when there's somebody like that in it.
So, we asked them, requested them, did everything for about six, seven months we lost all the rent and we didn't know what to do. He said he will go and live on there. His diplomat's father is very- I don’t know. They got three, four mad people and put them in the ground floor. And he told them that they are going to stay. Next morning, cleared out! Cleared out, absolutely!
Warren: Mother's going to do this in Shudy Camps, by bringing all the mad people and put a notice up on the door
Shri Mataji: No, but-
Warren: And the other owners will run away.
Gregoire: You never know, some may say, it’s good vibrations.
Shri Mataji: No, no. But the other thing . I tell you that, as soon as you bring mad people, everybody will act, "How are you? Can I bring tea for you?
Gregoire: Yes, yes, yes.
Shri Mataji: Everybody has a little-
Gregoire: People have so much love. Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Because they have a sympathy.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji, you know what we found out, in Founex, this house we had in Founex. We found out ,two days before leaving, that it had been used for handicapped children. And that's, and we have been fighting with this, that's why the house would never clear out. It was full of spiders. We had puja; yet, nothing doing. And we had horrible dreams and the children were, all our children were affected by this business too. Shri Mataji, we don't know how to fight bhoots. You see, we give a bandhan, what do we do? I move my hand; I don't know what happens. I don't see what happens.
Shri Mataji: And the country is full of it, you see. That's why you have schizophrenia, you have all this. So, so much full [unclear] it’s like, like lice in the head of a mad man.
[Laughter]
Gregoire: The head of Medusa
Shri Mataji: That’s what it is. [Unclear]

There's no fear about it, there's no fear. They have no fear, I mean, they have no fear. "Why do you have it? " They have no fear! The ego is so that they not even afraid of the AIDS. They have no fear about getting drugged. I mean there's no fear and that's the main point. A simple thing in India, people don't do it because they have fear.
Gregoire: And there is nothing, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: But if you are aware, here the people are like that they put their hands into the mouth of a snake: bite me, bite me, bite me!
Gregoire: You see, Shri Mataji, in the science fiction 80% of the teams of horror movies,
Shri Mataji: They are like this.
Gregoire: Is that the dead are back on Earth and are invading the living, the world of the living. This is what these people express in their own possession. But that's what is happening as a matter of fact. So, up to a certain point, we use lemons, we foot soak, we do this, we do that, and come to a point where all this doesn't seem to work. And then what do we do?
Shri Mataji: [Unclear] One case should not put pressure to that [unsure].
Gregoire: No but we-
Shri Mataji: We have cured people. Now they are all right [unsure]. It's not that bad. [Unclear] few places like that, it concerns us because of a person failed. I’ve seen like that. But-

Gregoire: Yes I mean, statistically speaking, probably it looks it looks insignificant.

Shri Mataji: Look at [unclear], when he came to me first. Or Yves [unclear].
Gregoire: No but-
Shri Mataji: Or Douglas.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji. In Switzerland, I must say we have had a lot of it, because I don't mention my family, which is what you know.
Shri Mataji: Mathias.
Gregoire: But we had Mathias, we had Vaikuntha who was completely, for hypnosis [unsure]. Hanumana was even-
Shri Mataji: [Unclear] mother. Hanumana.
I mean all of them.
Shri Mataji: Even his wife got caught up and [unclear] down.
Arnaud: Marie-Martine is much better.
Shri Mataji: Marie-Martine. Marie-Martine, oh God! Marie-Martine was a mad woman.
Then we had- I mean so many were having catches. Practically everybody was little off.
Arnaud: That's a good sign that it's an improvement, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: That's it. You see, we cannot say that it has not worked out despite the fact there were all kinds of problems, people were drug addicted. Mooladhara!
Warren: I'd say, on the contrary, the basic practices of Sahaja Yoga work in every case, except just one or two. And this is what we're talking about. In each country, there are one or two, finished! Guido’s system works as a second line of defence. But a third line of defence could be this, that's all, for one or two.
Shri Mataji: I agree. I've been seeing that. But for these, you get worried.
Warren: No, don't be worried. Let's be clearcut about it.

Shri Mataji: Yes, it's not so bad. I mean [unclear] about this.
Guido: Before Realization, we were all gone cases.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Guido: Before Realization we were all gone cases.
[Laughter]

Gregoire: The only difference, we didn’t know, that’s all.
Shri Mataji: There are some Swiss [unclear] certified themselves.
Warren: I mean they're all sitting around here, those some pretty gone cases!
[Laughter]
Arnaud: I would say all of us.
Shri Mataji: This way or that way.
Arnaud: I mean, on one side or on another side.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: [Unclear], just come on well, no doubt. But, it's a prophet here.

What are these little light things are?
Kingsley: It's Ruth's collection of mirrors, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: From mirrors?
Kingsley: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Collection of mirrors is a good idea. But only mirrors?
Kingsley: Well, some are mirrors and there's a drawing. And then there are two pieces of bas-relief that were found from the ruins of an old church. Shri Mataji, those two pieces of stone from a very old church in France, somewhere or I think- I'm not quite sure. Ruth knows the story.

Shri Mataji: I mean if you want to have mirrors, I can send so many of them. My daughter used to say, "You’d better start a shop of mirrors and combs and garlands".
[Laughter]
So they said, "One day, we have a celebration of the [unclear]". [Unclear] is the one where a married woman is regarded as something great. So we are supposed to call women for Haldi, Kumkum, and give them something. So, one day she had invited. She said, "Mother what should I give? " I said, "Now give my mirrors". So in one [unclear] Kumkum she gave my mirrors. There were so many, so small, this much! I mean, of course, given in the Puja, I kept away. But otherwise, so many mirrors I had! [Unclear] Even now, I must be having at least hundred. India is a place for mirrors. I didn't know she was collecting mirrors; I can give her so many! It’s a good idea.

They are all antique ones, are they?
Kingsley: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah!
Kingsley: Nearly all.
Shri Mataji: What is this three of them means?
Arnaud: It's like a tryptic.
Shri Mataji: What?
Kingsley: Yes; It's a- I don’t know, Shri Mataji. Arnaud says it’s a little bit like a tryptic. It opens out.
Warren: Like on a dressing table, you know how, Mother, you have three with a window.
Shri Mataji: No, but it is hanging with one thing only, very well done.
Warren: Especially hooked up. [Laughter] In bathrooms, they often, in old houses, used to have those three.
Shri Mataji: Oh. But she had very good icons.

Kingsley: I think-
Shri Mataji: Very good icons.
Gregoire: They were false Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: All?

Kingsley: All the paintings that Ruth bought in in Rome, Shri Mataji, turned out to be-
Gregoire: Not in Rome, in Geneva.
Kingsley: In Geneva, turned out to be fake.
Warren: Swiss fakes.
Gregoire: Was he Swiss?
Kingsley: Yes, the man was Swiss. And she is very sensitive about it.
[Laughter]
Gregoire: When we ask about Sahaja Yogis, is he Swiss, no is Argentinian. No, but if we speak about Swiss...
Shri Mataji: Swiss fakes, means what? They were done by Swiss for
Kingsley: We don't know whom they were done by Shri Mataji, but they were all-
Gregoire: Sold as a name but it was not.
Arnaud: Sold much more expensive than it should be.
Shri Mataji: She must have paid a lot.
Kingsley: She paid a fortune, Shri Mataji, and felt very, very hurt, because this man traded it, on a very close friendship with her and her sister. And treated them like daughters. And all the time he was milking them of money with these horrible fakes. The icons were quite nice but even the icons were-
Shri Mataji: Not real.
There's one thing I wanted to ask Ruth that she had some money in New York with some lady. And it’s a possibility we have a very good lawyer there, who can prosecute that plead for that So, she could give me the papers now we are going to San Francisco, San Francisco, San Diego. We need to meet that lawyer.
Gregoire: Ruth!
Kingsley: Ruth!
Shri Mataji: I think poor Ruth has a special luck to these thieves [unclear].
Gregoire: Yes poor thing. It looks like this.

Shri Mataji: Are you wearing the sweater?
Gregoire: Shri Mataji says, she has a very good lawyer in New York. Do you have the papers?
Shri Mataji: Not in New York. He is actually in San Diego.
Gregoire: San Diego.
Shri Mataji: And he's a very famous lawyer. We’ve got it now for this [unclear] show we got him. And now he's going to meet me. So, I was thinking, that lady who has taken your money, you can try.
Ruth: Yes, Shri Mataji, of course. I have the papers in the office. You are going at the start of September?
Shri Mataji: No, I am going now. So, I should go to tomorrow.
Tomorrow, if you can.
Ruth: I said in the office I was sick. But maybe Kingsley could go and get them for me. It would be nice. At least, you could copy them and give me some copy of that.
Gregoire: We can send it by Express.
Shri Mataji: Or you can write a letter saying what is it. And I'll ask him. At least, I’ll show him. And if he needs, you can send him the whole case.
Yes, he manages many things. Now I don't know what he is doing [unclear]. But Sada told me that [unclear] can have telephone.

Ruth: I have just tried again a new tentative to find her address. She seems to be escaping with her address. And every time for Rogatory commissions, they try to go and interrogate her. She seems to be disappearing in the nature. But then again, recently, in the last year or two, it seems that there have been a few interviews of her in some American newspapers, business reviews, and like that, as the success woman and success business woman and such things.
Shri Mataji: So you got it.
Ruth: So I found again the address, at least of her husband where he's working. And I send it to my lawyer and he's trying also.
Shri Mataji: Then we can tell the New papers also
Ruth: Oh, it would be good.
Kingsley: But the judge, in this particular case, is a very, seems to be a very nasty, lazy gentleman, who is quite prepared to waste time and do nothing about it.
Shri Mataji: Where? Here?
Ruth: In Geneva. He's also in charge.
Shri Mataji: They are all like that, I think. You know, judge have no respect for [unclear].
Ruth: He is also in charge to of the Marco’s or the Philippine tentative to get back the Marco’s money. And it seems that also there, he's very lazy.
Shri Mataji: He’s not going to get anything out of it, anyway. He's in charge of getting money. Lost money, isn’t it?
Ruth: Yes, a kind of restitution it to the Philippine government.
Shri Mataji: Really, they have a lack of appointing the right people at right places, I think.
[Laughter]
Warren: He's probably in hand with him.
Kingsley: He's probably a friend of Marcos.
Warren: He's probably in league.
Ruth: And my lawyer-
Shri Mataji: Is he?
Warren: Probably. I mean that's the way things go.
Kingsley: It’s quite possible.
Ruth: Well my lawyer-
Shri Mataji: But he cannot appoint Marcos, he cannot appoint somebody.
Warren: No, but I mean they can must be-
Shri Mataji: He must have been appointed by him. All right.
Ruth: Well my lawyer told me that, as a bureaucrat they, could not send him away. So, they put him in the place where he is least harmful, this particular judge.
Shri Mataji: They would not send him away.
Ruth: They cannot because he's appointed as bureaucrat.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear].
[Laughter]

Warren: Bureau - bureaucrat.
Sahaja Yogi: I'm getting deaf.
Shri Mataji: He is dealing with such a big thing like Marcos, and he's also dealing with your case. It is something I can’t understand. Is there only one judge or?
Ruth: He's judge of in instruction and I don't think there are many judges of instruction. Maybe five or six.
Warren: Instruction?
Shri Mataji: The best thing is-
Ruth: It’s called like that in French.
Shri Mataji: Best thing is to send wires, telegrams after telegrams. They reach about 12:00 in the night. You see? That’s how you’ll disturb that [unsure].
Sahaja Yogi: Mother’s method.
Guido: It’s so beautiful.
Shri Mataji: "I'm very much in trouble, only what should I do? I’m desperate [unclear] why don’t you do this and that". Because what can American lawyers also do? Unless and until there is something more [unclear].
Ruth: They tried the first time with the Americans, and they said they did not find her address.
Shri Mataji: But now you have an address for it?
Ruth: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Better say, "Now we found an address, you see, you must help me. I’m a Swiss girl, I'm being this thing. I'm in need of money. I'm in trouble, this, that ". Send him telegrams. Do it for one week. It will be all right. Let’s see.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: "Kantakam kantakaat" [Sanskrit]. Kantakam is a thorn. "Thorn is to be taken out of a thorn".
:Rustom: With a thorn.
Warren: With a thorn you can remove a thorn.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Yes, I think, best is to get after him when you have the address, you see. And you also give me in writing whatever it is. Really I'm surprised how you are cheated all the time.
He's telling me about the fake painting you have had. Who was this stupid fellow ?
Ruth: Nasty old man Shri Mataji,
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Ruth: A nasty old man. And he cheated my sister even much more than me.
Shri Mataji: But you can pursue him.
Ruth: I tried. I had also a lawyer but the lawyer did nothing. So I-
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Ruth: The lawyer only took money from me.
Shri Mataji: Why?
Ruth: And he managed nothing. He was useless Shri Mataji, the lawyer.
Shri Mataji: It’s a Japanese or Korean, somehow? Or Sahaja Yogi?
Arnaud: He is not Shri Mataji. We don't tell a Sahaja Yogi with a lawyer.
Gregoire: No. Yves is not a Sahaja Yogi.
Arnaud: is not a Sahaja Yogi.
Shri Mataji: But he will help. He's a good man.
Arnaud: But still, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Arnaud: Still. Do you know how much a lawyer charge for 1 hour? 600 Franks! Yes.

You remember, Shri Mataji, the case of, the radio case, three years ago, we had all these problems. And I just had a consultation with the lawyer. He just listened to the cassette. They wrote a letter that they could not do anything. We had to pay 600 Francs.
Gregoire: But this is a racket of the first water, Shri Mataji.
Arnaud: Lawyers, this is another stuff.
Gregoire: They are all against the law.
Kingsley: The lawyer was as bad as this man.
Shri Mataji: Why don’t you start to practice?
Arnaud: I should maybe I'm a bit too old, no? 32.
Shri Mataji: But old lawyers are better than young ones.
Arnaud: One thing I should do Shri Mataji, is to go to two years to go in a practice and a practice and then to have my degree, the higher degree to start.
Gregoire: He's not a lawyer, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: He’s done his [unclear].
Gregoire: No. In Switzerland, to practice, first you have to have your basic degree. Then you have two years practice, then you have final examination. All this, he has not done. And final examination, then you are an ‘avocat du barreau’ [barrister] which is entitled to practice. Before, he is not.

Shri Mataji: The solution seems to be like this, you see, that if you get a transfer away from here. Say, India or some place, somewhere, then we can use Indian lawyers, can’t we?
Ruth: The man who cheated me
Arnaud: Because the case has been made here.
Ruth: The man who cheated me for the paintings, he's 80 years old or something like that. He's very old.
Shri Mataji: So you just right to him.
Ruth: I try to, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Then?
Ruth: I sent him a very threatening letter,
Shri Mataji: He is alone?
Ruth: Then he wrote to my sister, and he told my sister, "You should make pressure on your young sister that she should not run after me for money and so on ". And, "How can she?" And my sister wrote him back and told
Shri Mataji: What about? What is he doing with his money? In the bank?
Ruth: His wife is dead. His son died when he was 20 years old of leukaemia. He has nobody else Shri Mataji. And he has no more friends. He's cheated all his friends. He's a lonely horrible old man.
Shri Mataji: There a wife.
Ruth: His wife died of cancer also.
Shri Mataji: You can't even get a ransom out of it.

A ransom, one can get. He can get a ransom of it.
Ruth: Ransom?
Shri Mataji: He can get ransom [unclear].

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, it’s very strange.
[Laughter]
May I talk about something else, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: All right.
Gregoire: I don't know whether it's completely wrong but I get some vibrations when I’m thinking about it. So, I don't know what it's correct or not. But I wonder whether I should get married again, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: And me neither.
Gregoire: Because everybody who is around me get down, one after the other, more or less. Shri Mataji: They’ve done what?
Gregoire: All those who are next to me.
Shri Mataji: Gregoire is a very pessimistic fellow.
[Laughter]

Gregoire: But I get vibrations when I think of it.
Shri Mataji: He is never satisfied. Now shut up now! I had enough. Any time he goes on with pessimistic. See now, anything you give him, he'll give the black side of it. It's a typical bureaucrat. Now stop it!
Gregoire: All right. Why do I feel cool when I think about it?
Shri Mataji: What? What did you think?

Gregoire: That I should tell you that. And I feel vibration I don't understand.
Shri Mataji: You are very deceptive, I think. Better not rely on that.
You see, you have- because the trouble with you, Gregoire, is this way: that you cannot take a stand without having that kind of a bureaucratic fear in your mind. So, when you get up- get out of that bureaucratic fear, then you get cool breeze, in a settler way.
You have that bureaucratic way, "If I get married what is going to happen?"

Your wife is a little bit like you, I must say. This lady also.
Gregoire: No but, that's what I saw today Shri Mataji.
[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogini: Something happened. Something happened this morning with, while you were working on Inès, on this child, the children were upstairs, the two children. And at that time, I thought, it came to my mind, "All right, they are upstairs, they should be OK. And I thought I would go and have a go shoe-beat, go to the lake, have a foot soak. So, I went downstairs for a while. And when I came back, Gregoire was there with the two children. The children were crying. Gregoire was upset and I thought, "Oh my God, what's happened? What have I done?" And it turned out that Machindranat had fallen down, hit his head. And Gregoire found him crying and was upset because I wasn't there, of course. And so we, I was, you know, we were trying to find what had happened. And when I put my attention at Sahasrara, it felt like, somehow, I got drawn away from the picture. And then this happened, and this happened, and this happened. And some sort of negative attack. And so and that was the story then we saw it. And this was happening while you were working on this baby.
Shri Mataji: You, see there's a saying in Marathi, "Bhitya paathi Brahma rakshas" The one who is all the time frightened, "bhitya", the brahma rakshasas are after, "Bhitya paathi Brahma rakshas". Now if you say anything anymore, you’ll be "bhitya".
[Laughter]
Arnaud: What means "bhitya"?
Sahaja Yogini: It means "beaten".
Warren: Scared, you’ll be.
Shri Mataji: That's all. Just trying to frighten you. Can't you see the game?
Sahaja Yogini: But then we saw, then it seemed like it was like bandits wanting to come into the house. And so they call you away. And then they do their mischief. But then we saw it.
Shri Mataji: So, what is it that Gregoire should understand, first of all. Basically you don't know Gregoire. If I tell you one after another, the history of Mr Gregoire, and he’s ‘bhitya pana’ [unsure], then you will know how many people, one after another. It’s not a question of marriage. His own mother [unclear] Gregoire, another devil. Then came another count he sent. Then came that Jenny, Cherry who’s so ever. Oh! [Laughter]
Gregoire: My aunt.
Shri Mataji: Then came his sisters. One better than the other. Three of them gave us problems. Then his sister-in-law also had a problem. "Bhitya", you see, from rakshas. So, then his wife, then his children now you.

So, one person is having all these experiences. So, there's something wrong with you.
Gregoire: But
Shri Mataji: That is what it is; it’s that you are extremely frightened all the time for nothing at all.

"Shivo ham, Shivo ham, Shivo".
Rustom: Shri Mataji, when you have the Devi Parmeshwari as your Mother, you should not fear anything.
Shri Mataji: That's it. Who are you facing here?

Why it gets cooler, because that "bhityaness" disappears. Nothing can work out with a "bhitya". I tell you, it cannot.
Rustom: You should say that-
Shri Mataji: And so many times I've told Gregoire. And then, you see, he feels hurt and he thinks that, "She has let me down". That's not the point is. That's not the point that he is letting me down. But this nature of fearing, anything I tell you, immediately- you see, there are two bureaucrats. Once I had to face this gentleman, and then that one also. Warren is not a "bhitya". That's something thing, about good about him, thanks God! He is not a "bhitya".
But, you see, he will come out with objections more than solutions, for a long time. Then suddenly, he sees himself. Now he's better.
Like, I was telling him that I can go to Italy. "No Mother. That's a Saturday, Sunday". "No Mother, that is this thing". He would not say, "All right, you go on such and such day", no. Every time he was be telling me, "It’s either Saturday or Sunday. You cannot go on before the first". "This cannot be done". But when should I go he never told me.

Rustom: Gregoire should say-
Shri Mataji: You see the point. The suggestion is all the time about what I cannot do. But what I can do, he never told. It's a fact or not?
Warren: Yes, it’s true Mother.
Shri Mataji: So, I mean, it is much better now. Before it was formidable. So, it's all right.
I have two advisors sitting here.

The second one is Mr Gregoire. He's a "bhitya".
Gregoire: Means a frightened person.
Shri Mataji: No, I mean it's a bureaucratic fright, which is just a thing, takes a form, always. You see, what are these ‘bhoots’ and all that? Nothing but our fears, which takes a form. Like, today, I've got this glass. This must have been in somebody's mind. So, it got a form. In the same way, our fears become the bhoots.
Sahaja Yogini: So, Shri Mataji, this morning, what happened? What was this little drama?
Warren: She just said it, our fears become the bhoots.
Gregoire: But no! Because this morning, I was not afraid before it happened. Something happened.
Shri Mataji: No, no. It is, your fears are there all the time, whether you should marry or not, whether the marriage will be successful. This is the first fear you have. Second, she's also little worried, why?

Because she thinks that the two fears she has, if I may tell you, one is that you are leader and leader's wives are always caught up. Just see, I can read you very well. And the second fear she has is this, that supposing she marries. And then, she's not a successful wife, or she starts behaving the same way as your wife has behaved, because she's little left-sided.
Gregoire: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Then, what to do? Between the two fears, what's going to work out? So, I think you’d better marry Barbara. The solution comes in.
[Laughter]

That’s the best solution!
Warren: That's something to be afraid of!
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: That’s something positive, it is difficult. It is in Akaar, it is in form, already there. Ah! That solves the problem. You go and you might be happy.
Now see the vibrations: is it cool?
[Laughter]
you need

Rustom: The best way, Shri Mataji, to get rid of a mythical fear is to give a real one.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: The best way to get rid of a mythical fear is to give a real one.
Shri Mataji: To get rid of?
Rustom: Of an imaginary fear is to give a real one.
Sahaja Yogini: But Shri Mataji, somehow, we have to face these things isn't it?
Shri Mataji: You’d better [unclear] now, very important. This one is another.
Rustom: [Unclear] they say the mantra of Bhaya Karini.
Shri Mataji: And if the mantra is said in the deeps, in the heart even. What is there when your Mother is here. How many people had this? And Gregoire also, she also knows. How many times I protected them just like that!
Rustom: Shri Mataji-
Shri Mataji: See, the faith is not there!
Rustom: In the West, Shri Mataji, there isn't, there is no tradition of heroism, of facing enormous odds, Shri Mataji, for the sake of the Devi or something. Like, they don't have any-
Shri Mataji: I’m yet to see heroes coming down to me.
Rustom: They don't have anyone like, what’s- this Rani of [unclear], or anyone like this, or Rani of Jhansi. Like that, they don’t have.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] Guido is some brave heart [unsure] and also Warren does that. Gregoire so many times does it. I mean if it comes to lectures, if it is coming to writing book, all right. All these things, it’s all right. But as it comes to family...
Rustom: Does he?
Shri Mataji: So, he’s like that. A to Z. He gets very upset. The reason is he has had a very bad experience, you see, because of the [unclear].

[To a child]
Now, one thing I must tell you. Come here. Then I'm going to get you a good moment. Come here, come! No, not that way. Come here soon. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3 up towards [unclear]. Come here 1, 2, 3, immediately run! 1, 2, 3, you must run! You must run! Run, run, run, fast! Fast, fast, fast, fast! Very fast, very fast! Some of the Teddy is going otherwise. Come along, come along, come along. Fast!
[Laughter]

There’s a little, something is there. Ha! That has an effect on children.
After water, Jai Shri Mataji.

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, perhaps, that's why I had cool vibrations, because so that I just bring, cause I'm not afraid of showing whatever I am, even if it's not very much Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: No, no, that's not this. You see, you get cool vibrations because these things psychologically act on you. Family things act on you. I mean, sort of, Machindranat, if he has fallen, I mean, so every child falls down. There is nothing so great about it. Nothing so great. But anything happens to the children- first about the sisters. Oh, oh, oh, oh!
When she was not getting a child, he was after Me. Maybe she's still a virgin, I don't know what to do. It’s all [unclear] Now she's got a child. Now have it!
[Laughter]

Gregoire: No, but I have to- yes, as says my dear fiancée, I mean, I have to face it somehow this is not -
Shri Mataji: Non, no but you did that throughout. Now think that you have no family, that's all. That's the best way to look at things, you see. You think, "It's all Mother’s family. She is looking after people".
Rustom: Actually, Shri Mataji, it is an illusion. Because his family is born from which woman?
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: His family is born-
Gregoire: Yes, I mean, you know, thank you very much Rustom.
Shri Mataji: That's it. That's very true. Did you see? What he's saying is the truth.
Gregoire: Yes, of course, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: That is what it is. So, when the friends tell you, you should take it with understanding that they doing it to encourage you to come up. You see, this is only one weak point you have Gregoire. You have to work on it.
Everybody has some weak points which I know everybody’s weak points. But at least, whatever it is today, I'm telling you because you being one of the leaders quite dynamic, you see. Sometimes, if you see a lion behaving like a lamb -
Rustom: Or a pussy-cat.
Shri Mataji: You get worried, you see.
Gregoire: So what is the weak point Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: The weak point is your family. I have told you, you are very, emotionally, you get attached and involved in the family. That’s your weak point.

Gregoire: Yes. Now it comes cool on the left side.
Rustom: Actually your real mother,
Shri Mataji: That should be-
Rustom: Your real mother-
Shri Mataji: That should be-
Rustom: Your real Mother is sitting before you.
Gregoire: It, Ruth -
Shri Mataji: That's, that's the point! That's the point which should be said just now.
Gregoire: All right.
Shri Mataji: Nothing to feel bad, because that's what you tell yourself.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Now. So, everybody, on their weak points, go wrong.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: It's all right. It's not- you are much better now. I mean, from experience you must learn. Your divorce came like a magic; why did you think about that?
Gregoire: Yes I mean, this is the best news of the year, Shri Mataji. My divorce made me feel that I'm still, somehow, you know.
Shri Mataji: Still started, see?
Gregoire: Yes. I stopped. I just stopped there. I saw it coming.
Shri Mataji: You could see that.
Gregoire: I just stop. I stop speaking.

Rustom: Shri Mataji, in some sense-
Shri Mataji: In a complete way, in a full way, in every way, to have a faith. You see, Gregoire, you don't know how much people had to sacrifice for any revolution whatsoever.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: I've seen both the things I've seen in my family, when they sacrificed to get the freedom of India. You won't believe how much they sacrificed. When I think of it, I mean I tell you, one thousand of that also, you cannot do to yourself. My father had a huge property, landed property, rich man. We had cars and we had those, what you call them. Like a ‘[unclear]’ sort of thing.
Rustom: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: Ha. [Unclear] they had horses, everything in the houses, you see. Very, very rich people.

And then they just jumped into the politics. His clothes were stitched in England. You can imagine, such a rich man. Everything he bought. My mother joined hands with him. I mean they were chivalrous people, you see, people of character.
As he says like Rani of Jhansi, heroes like Shivaji.
Rustom: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: So many of them! So many of them, you should see that. And I see my own father. And the government came in and confiscated everything. Just, you see, we had no house, nothing. This Balas sahib's house was, you see, you saw the Balas sahib's house.
Warren: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: What a dilapidated one, you see! In that, my father lived. Because this was a house he had sold it to someone. So, that fellow gave that house to use.
But then, he also got under pressure. So, we went and stayed in huts!

They gave me electric shocks, me! And made me sleep. I was a young girl of 19 years, imagine. But look at my father, what a brave man he was! He said, "What is, for one child, to be sacrifice in the name of others. Here you get worried a little bit if he falls down, something happens to him. "Let all my children be sacrificed for my country. Let us get the freedom". Even George Washington was there, Abraham Lincoln. We want such people today. It's the greatest revolution of the world.

Gregoire: But consciously, I am like this, Shri Mataji,
Shri Mataji: But you see-
Gregoire If something happens to me-
Shri Mataji: But not unconsciously. Build up yourself unconsciously. When you just get into unconscious, you get your attention, absolutely, absolutely onto something, which is ridiculous compared to the whole. Just see it. Compared to the whole thing that happened, absolutely ridiculous! So many people Gandhiji got like that, who were just willing to sacrifice their lives. Sahaja Yoga is a gain all the time for you. You gain all the time: materially, in every way it is. But because of your little, little weaknesses, you people suffer.

"Yoga kshemam Vahamyaham" [Bhagavad Gita, chapter 9, verse 22] No doubt of it. Means, in every way, it is a gain.
Otherwise, think of it. Without Sahaja Yoga, where you would have been today?
Gregoire: I don't think I would be in life Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: So, that's what I'm saying, see the gain I mean the gain part. What is the sacrifice? Nothing.
Gregoire: No, no.
Shri Mataji: No sacrifice.
Gregoire: No. No sacrifice, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: This is what it is. Now look at Shivaji. Shivaji was a very nobleman [unsure], a very good person. His mother told that, "You have to compromise with people. You have to marry". He married four times. He had to have four wives because of political alliances. And his stories are so many, but one I'll tell you.

His mother sent him a letter saying that - what a mother she must be to have such children also – that, "If you are eating your food, come to wash your hands".
It was about quite a long distance, 30/40 miles by going by a horse. So quick he must have ride. So, when he reached there, she made him sit and she said, "I want to play with you this [Marathi] chess".
Rustom: Chess.
Shri Mataji: Chess. "I want to play chess". Chess.
And they started playing the chess.

[Aside] Swadishthan, Hamsa.
All right now, take this. Are you better now?

Go back like this. Go back. [Unclear]. All right. It’s [unclear]. Left side.
Hello, now you have to sit there like, like everybody is sitting, like a big girl. You're a small or big girl? You are big girl?
[Cut in the audio at 1:31:52]

[Battle of the fort Kondana/Singahad in 1670, led by Tanaji Mulasare] "... We won overnight ". "You won?" He showed the letter of a Rajput [unclear]. That, "I’m in prison and my brother Suraji [unsure]. I’m in prison here and this ‘Kiledar’ [commander], the one who is a–
Rustom: In charge of the fort.
Shri Mataji: In charge of the fort, you see. He is going to marry tomorrow. Before that, I want a religious [unclear]". Even Kiledars in those days, were religious people and they would not use people who were married. Can you imagine? But still.
Rustom: He was a Muslim, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Overnight, you see, they had won. And he was sitting, he went, came out and sat down like this. [Unclear] early in the morning, as if he knew what was happening.
So, Shiva- Tanaji had come with his father, Mickael [unsure]. And he said, "I've come to invite you for the marriage of my son".

So he was sitting quite upset like this. He said, "What’s the matter, Sir?" He was one of his [unclear] one of his court guards, you can say. They had nothing like court, nothing. He was not even sort of made a king or anything. They were all having a guerilla warfare at that time. So, he said, "Mother has ordered- he used to call her Mother Masa. My mother has ordered me that I have to go and conquer this ‘kiledar’. No question! Not, "How I will do?" Nothing! "I have to do. I have to go, I’ll go. This is night, we are going to attack. And the he said "[Unclear], I'm going". "Why should you go?" "You can get many Tanajis but not Shivajis! I am going. Let me go first. I will do this". So, Shivaji said, "But your son is getting married". There are words, you see, in the history written down. He was just an ordinary farmer, Tanaji, He said, "Your son is getting married". So, he said, "First let me marry this fort to my sword, and then I will". [Kondana-Sinhagad fort] You see, these words just fill you up with energies. And he said, "You don't worry, cancel the marriage".
And then he took a, what you call, a kind of a lizard, you get a big lizard, we call it ‘ghorpad’. His name was Yeshwant. It's all written, you know. We just respect all this. And Maharashtra is built by these things.

And that seen over, which you see here from my house, you can see that hill, that one is similar. It was called as Torna before, now it’s over.

So, on one side, which is a very stiff side, they made the thick rope [unsure]. It was a thing they used for climbing up. And she came back three times back, you see, that means not so good. But she said, "Doesn't matter, better go". And she went up and she put her cloth there. And then somebody went up and put a need [unsure], a big thing. And then everybody started climbing from that side, which was very neglected, because it was a steep thing, [unclear].
You see, the war started between, I mean, in the night suddenly they arrived. Nobody was prepared, it was very difficult. And Tanaji was killed. He was killed and Shivaji said that, "If you have won the thing, you put a fire". So, they put a fire in. So, Shivaji came on his horse to see in the morning. And when he came there, everybody was like this. And he saw the dead body of Tanaji covered with blood. He bowed to it and then he said one sentence, which is also written. He said, “Gad ala pan Sinha gela”. "You’ve got the fort, but you have lost the lion". That's why it is called as Sinhagad.
See, of that metal, Maharashtra is made. Of that metal. That's why it's working here.

Here we are with our little, little things. What are we giving to Mother? What are we doing for her? Bringing our own problems, solving our problems, using Sahaja Yoga and benefiting from it. What have we done for Sahaja Yoga? What’s [unclear]?

People used to starve, I mean, we have Sahasraras ourselves when a particular [unclear] In Maharashtra, we launched the 42 movement, you see that?

[Battle of Pavan Khind in 1660, led by Baji Prabhu Deshpande] There was another man, Baji Prabhu Deshpande, which you’ll see, where you pass through, to that river, where you take your bath, you know, the Krishna river. You pass through a place, you see? You must have seen.
Rustom: Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: We pass through a -
Shri Mataji: A proper [unclear], they call it, it’s a pass.
Warren: It's like a very narrow, narrow pass.
Shri Mataji: It’s one narrow pass, yes.
Warren: A pass, yes.
Shri Mataji: That's a very famous one.
Warren: It's up on the left-hand side, as you're coming from-
Shri Mataji: Its name is Pavan Khind, we say, it means ‘auspicious’. We look forward. That one who was like this, that the story about it is Baji Prabhu Deshpande.

What he did that, this is a long story, but I will tell you. There was one Shaista Khan, one fellow, who had promised Aurangzeb that, "I will go and catch this mouse of the mountain". That’s Shivaji. His name was Shaista Khan. And he came down and he defeated people and settled down in Pune, in Shaniwar Wada [built on the Lal Mahal ruins]. You’ve seen the Shaniwar wada there. The Shaniwar Wada, you’ve seen the big stone structure they have. That's the only thing that they have Shaniwar Wada when we staid, you see, near this place. We’ll go and have a look this time, Shaniwar Wada is the place. It’s an old fort inside.
Gregoire: Inside Pune.
Shri Mataji: Inside Pune.
Rustom: Oh, yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: you can always go around it always, this one.
Rustom: Shivaji’s fortress [Chakan?].
Shri Mataji: Yes. That was the, now it's quite [unclear], but still a stony thing. So, he settled down there nicely. Shaista Khan was there. Now everybody was with Shivaji, no doubt, the whole public and everything. But nobody was allowed to form a group or anything. This country business started from then, I think.

[Trick against Shaista Khan in April 1663] So, Shivaji was very clever. They made a wedding party [Hindi] They made a wedding party: all the men carried swords with them. And they went around that Shaniwar Wada. And from the back side, somebody inside the Shaniwar Wada opened the door for them so all of them went inside. And nobody knew that they were in. And he [unclear].

So, Shaista Khan started running and his hands were on the sill of the window. Shivaji put his big sword on it. So, they say that, "He escaped for the life, but felt on the window sill". These are all sayings, every day we use it. And he ran away.
Then Shivaji came up, came out from there. And he wanted to deceive, you see, this man. They were following him up. So, he was going. What happened that there were two roads: one passing through this path, and another straight way, which was more for the horses. What he did that, they had kept lots of these bullocks tied to their horns, where those [unclear] like things, you see. Just like made out of a-
Sahaja Yogi: Straw.
Shri Mataji: Straw? You can say straw, but a kind of a- it’s a more strong, you can say, like some sort of ropes. Some sort of ropes there. Tied with that, they kept ready there.
So, so as soon as Shivaji came in, you see, what happened that they lighted those, and all of them started running that side.

[Back to the Pavan Khind battle in 1660, led by Baji Prabhu Deshpande] Now when these people and Shivaji passed through that small little pass, and Baji Prabhu Deshpande, he was made to stand there. And he said, "Well, as soon as I will reach the [unclear] the fort tower, this thing, then I will, from there, I will give you a big gun fire. And then you’ll know that I have reached". He said, "All right".

So, these people started following those bulls, you see, because they thought the light is there; they thought, "This is Shivaji, we will follow them". That's how they were misled. By that time, Shivaji ran out of that pass, [unclear]. But when they reached, they were already on the horses! They found out different things, so they so they turned around and came to the Pavan Khind. They turned around and then Baji Prabhu Deshpande was there. Then he started fighting. And he was fighting and he didn't hear the sound. And his neck was cut, absolutely. But his body was moving in such a tremendous speed, that he killed many Muslims.
And then they say that, when the sound came, the body felt. Exceptionally brave and sacrificing.

Thousand and one stories about Shivaji, if you hear them, you’ll be surprised how great he was. Not only that, but he created also people like that.
So, this is what we want in Sahaja Yoga, people of that calibre, and that level and that kind.
"All right Mother, whatever we will manage. Leave it to us". And that was for just freedom from Muslims. How people sacrifice, you have no idea. How much here, little sacrifices people don't want to do. If anything appears, then [unclear] they get upset. This thing appears, you get upset. You have no idea to amount of sacrifice they did.

[Imprisoned in Agra in May 1666] There is another story about Kannauj Wala [unclear]. I tell you, so many stories there are!
Aurangzeb deceived Shivaji and told him that, "You come here and we do the -what you call- [Marathi?]
Rustom: Treaty?
Shri Mataji: Truce, to make a truce. Just cheated him. And, I mean, he did it in such a devil way that he really felt that he is going to die. Because Shivaji killed so many people, Afzal Khan, this, that. And he really got fed up also, Aurangzeb thought that he cannot [unclear].
So he came down. Aurangzeb called Shivaji and his son Sambhaji, both of them. Then he got them arrested. Aurangzeb was a rakshasa. And decided to put them in jail. Now there no way of escape for Shivaji and Sambhaji from there.
So, what they did, Shivaji said that, "You see, I have to celebrate the anniversary of something, that is my religion. Something he said. And I must distribute sweets that you must permit me. I'll have to distribute sweets for that". And for sweets started coming in, in big, big ‘topalyas’ we call them, big baskets. And the people, the people who were guarding, guards, they said, "Oh, we should also have some sweets". And those sweets had some sort of a thing in it, by which you sleep, you see.
So, in the night, when they were carrying those out, all of them had gone to sleep also. And they went inside that, and they escaped. They escaped: Shivaji went by one way and they sent the son by another way because they thought that the son will take some time to reach. And it should be better from the other side. So, they miss Shivaji but they started following Sambhaji, you see.

Now this Kannauj Wala [unsure] was the fellow who was taking Sambhaji with him. He was a Brahmin. And Brahmins don't normally eat food with non-Brahmins, you see, in those days especially. So, they followed him and they asked Sambhaji that, "If he's your son, why don't you eat food together?" "Yes, yes. We eat food and eat together". Just because, after all, his son was to be saved. But this is nothing. Then he reached a point where Sambhaji was carried away by some other people. And these, again came back, these Muslims, what you call them Shivaji’s soldiers. And they said, "Where is your son?" And he could not answer. So, they put ashes of, burning ashes into the mouth of Kannauj Wala [unsure] He died the way they tortured him.

Rustom: Shivaji got a sword from his mother, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah. Bhavani [name of Shivaji’s sword]. She had the [unclear], really no doubt.
Now Hindus have become militant. I don't know what they will do.
I just can't say but, what I'm trying to tell you that, it's a metal.

He had walked upon one fellow, [unclear] was good. He was quite a fellow who- he resigned from [unclear] and all that. And I thought this one will really work out.
But he was deluded again by politicians and he joined politics. He lost his election. He is so improvident and all that. You see, these are the truths.

But in those days, nobody could delude away, nothing.

And he [Shivaji] put his own son in the jail.
Rustom: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Sambhaji, ah!
Rustom: Somehow, Sambhaji.
Shri Mataji: You saw that fault on him, yes.
Rustom: He went there and he was jailed, Shri Mataji, yes. For drinking.
Shri Mataji: Because he used to drink. He was a drunker and all that and- Aurangzeb sent one fellow to entice Sambhaji, and to teach him how to drink, this, that. There were funny values also.
Rustom: Shri Mataji, just to have faith in the Devi as protector. This all comes from faith in the Devi as protector as Durga, that protects absolutely through the blood.
Shri Mataji: Faith! That's what I'm saying. The faith is, that’s the thing. I mean, even in 42 movement, the way people fought in India.
You see, my father was a very respectable man in the High Court and all that. And when they started early in 1935, I think, the flag, the national flag, Indian national flag, what we call Indian national flag. They thought of replacing it with the Union Jack.

So, they told my father that, "You can do". So, when he started going up, you see, somebody uh a horse came and hit him here. He still had that. He started bleeding. But even with that bleeding, he went up and hoisted the flag and came down. They were all shooting at him. Nothing happened to him, but only that he was bleeding. He came home then he got arrested Thirst-five he must be about age.
Sahaja Yogi: The brother?
Rustom: The father.

Shri Mataji: I don't really remember the year of my father's birth something. It must be 1895 or something. [July 15, 1883]
Rustom: He must be 40, 45, Shri Mataji. That time, you would be 12 years old.
Shri Mataji: In 35? Ah, yes, I would be 12 years.
[Unclear], we have had that from our childhood. He used to go and do strikes. He got arrested by police. He could no return. I've never known fear in my life. I've never known any kind of fear. When anything absurd happens, I was the most peaceful, just peaceful. I mean when these things happened, everybody got upset. I was the one most peaceful. When this lady came to hit me, I was the most peaceful.

Can you put on the light?
Rustom: Shri Mataji, this is the [unclear], the tattva of the heart, the purity of principle.
Shri Mataji: You see, I'm that also.
Rustom: You are that.
Shri Mataji: How can I get hurt? But what I'm saying, you should have that understanding. And these are not important, you see, you pay importance to say, marriage with children. All this is nonsense! Something- it's just, you see, why? Because I have to establish a marriage institution, I ask you to marry. Even there’s nothing in it. No sense. I wish you could be like Brahmacharis.

But it doesn't work out. There’s only one person I allowed to be Brahmachari was Charan, and how he went off, you see.
Arnaud: Who is he, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: You have to be balanced.
Gregoire: Charan.
Arnaud: Ah, Charan! Yes, I remember Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: He's the only one. And he's gone off his head. Absolutely off his head. Another is Parekar. He's awful.

I can say, Waralika is another one. Ask him. He is such a –
Warren: Absolutely.
Shri Mataji: Dynamic.
Warren: He's a fireball. And so clear cut in his thinking. He's probably the best example of a of a Westerner. I mean, a man in the West.
Shri Mataji: No he's a Maharashtrian.
Warren: I know, Mother, but-
Shri Mataji: He is a Maharashtrian.
Warren: He's sitting here in the West, I mean, coping with the West.
Shri Mataji: Immediately. He put Madhuri right. He put her husband right, everything in Ganapatipule.
Warren: He's just such a tremendous man.
Shri Mataji: He's not jealous, he's so generous. He's so intelligent, so knowledgeable.

He missed with the Nobel prize, you know? He found out about carbon. He writing a thing on Science: Science and Sahaja Yoga.
His wife had a problem and the doctor said, "It may be cancer". He said, "Nothing can happen to her".
And he was- actually this Rama Krishna's thing had given him a lacuna in his head. He can cure it. But as usual, this horrible this, what her name was, this Jubert?
Sahaja Yogini: Hum.
Shri Mataji: What's her name?
Sahaja Yogini: Michael and ...
Warren: Mathew?
Sahaja Yogini: No, no the other one. Tracy.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: Tracy.
Shri Mataji: Tracy. Tracy she got after him! And just she also managed our Brian. They took a flat. Wouldn't stay in his house. Just imagine! She took a hall for 9,000 pounds for one night! She managed. And they all got against Waralika. But I supported him. "You tell me precisely what made you [do this]? " "Tracy said so". "Tracy said so".

Rustom: Shri Mataji, my experience is that the problem is that people like Waralika, they are simple. They have no loops of funny things on them. And the Western mind is complicated. And if it cannot have something complicated, it rejects it immediately.
Shri Mataji: Ah; You see, themselves are good for nothing. And this Tracy is a useless woman absolutely useless! Good for nothing. Absolutely, you can call her a [unclear], useless absolutely. She stands nowhere.

You see, the day I was going to America, first time, she jumped into the thing. And Gavin said, "Mother, she wants to go with you". I said, "Who is she?" "She was so impressed by you, Mother, she wants to go with you". This thing, that thing. She told me she's very great in photography. This, that, and all that. And that she had a special type of a camera.
Sahaja Yogini: Surely.
Shri Mataji: She was taking aura, this, that. Nothing! And such a bombastic girl! She told me, "This house, this building was done by my uncle. This was done by mother. This thing, that thing. All kinds of stupid things. And her husband Michael was another- ah! He was a buck!
Sahaja Yogi: A buck. What is a buck?
Shri Mataji: And both of them impressed our Brian of all the things! And the amount of money had to shell out without achieving anything.
And on this hand was another lady. From all the sides, torn between all these people.

One should know that these people not only had faith in what Shivaji was doing, but also that they knew that it is for our good, not for Shivaji’s good. That should happen to us. And we should know this is our responsibility, we have to do it.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: It’s our job. How we do it? It’s our job. How we achieve it? It’s our job.
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: It's not only Mother's job.
Gregoire: No.
Shri Mataji: You see?
Gregoire: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: In what country, in Europe, you had people who were great?
Rustom: It was never found Shri Mataji.
Gregoire: In Switzerland, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Guido: We had some in Italy also.
Gregoire: They were perhaps more ferocious than brave. They were very, very-
Shri Mataji: Ferocious is not great.
Gregoire: No, but they were brave Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: The ones who sacrifice ideals and things.
Gregoire: Yes.
Guido: Yes.
Rustom: Six or seven hundred?
Shri Mataji: They never went for war!
Gregoire: Oh, yes Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Gregoire: Yes.
Rustom: Six or seven hundred years ago.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: About six or seven hundred years ago. They were brave people.
Gregoire: No, wait. Yes, four hundred years ago, very brave people in this country.
Shri Mataji: Even England surprisingly, you see. They say German, English and now you say Swiss.

England were the ones who won the battle, in that [unclear]. It was Churchill who managed. Gregoire: The Royal Air Force, yes.
Shri Mataji: Yes, I mean, it was, we must say, it was the Britishers. Till yesterday. Today, I don't know what to say.

Arnaud: It's true because you can see, Shri Mataji, today in politics, how the world affairs are being ruled. We have no bravery in the Western world.
Gregoire: No, no. It's nowhere. It's all compromise and protecting oneself.
Rustom: Moral courage.
Arnaud: Exactly.
Gregoire: No moral courage anywhere, anywhere, anywhere.
Arnaud: It's combination, it's just, go around and around.

Gregoire: So, Shri Mataji, after all, I had to here all this, Shri Mataji. That's why the vibrations were cool.
Shri Mataji: You should become fearless Gregoire, very much.
Gregoire: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Guido is, I must say, a very fearless man. I must say that it’s his character.
And another is, I find, is Doctor Spiro. Very fearless, absolutely fearless. Of course, Warren is there. You are there. All of you have that. But as far as the fear is concerned, David Spiro is so straight, "So, what? They've said it, it will be".

We were going by car and the car is very slow moving over, this white car is. Because it is a diesel thing, compared to the other one. I said, "I think they'll be very much worried about us and this". "No, no, Mother. This is a very nice car, I'm enjoying the movement of the car, like a big elephant". Like that.
Now Rustom is there. See, he is bravely facing these awful things. They're all facing it. Like, you can say that your brother is very good, but we must find out where do we lack the contribution part in Sahaja Yoga. What do we have to do to get over?

You are looking like Antoinette, today. Aren’t you?
How is it, paining there? You are all right?

Gregoire sits next to him. Not to [unclear] for daddy. Let’s sit now. Ah! Good.

Rustom: Shri Mataji, people cannot be fearless unless they have faith in their M.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: People cannot be fearless without faith in their Mother.
Shri Mataji: Unless?
Rustom: They have faith in their Mother.
Shri Mataji: No, not that they have faith. But the faith also has many aspects, perhaps. It's a kind of a temperament, I think. You see, like a child who has faith in mother, but he's frightened still. He grows up, he's matured.
Faith has more aspects.
Rustom: But the essence of fearlessness, Shri Mataji, is faith in the Devi.
Shri Mataji: I mean, the sense of security should be built in, that's all.

Actually, people forget that they have Adi Shakti as their Mother, at times. This one is to be remembered, every moment. Next day [unclear].

I've definitely done two things which Krishna has promised: yoga [union] and kshema [well-being].
‘Shastra dharma’ [unsure], what you called [unclear] is to be established in you, is to be done by you.
Rustom: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: That should be done.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear conversation]

Warren is quite brave. He is not afraid of anything. Sometimes, he comes out with propositions.
Warren: Obstructions.
Shri Mataji: No, no, the obstructions are at another level, you see. But at some levels, it comes out very great into something, that’s all. But at another level, they are obstructions. They are not, at some levels. But sometimes-
Warren: It’s a different sort of fear, I suppose.
Shri Mataji: That's what I'm saying. It has an aspect. Fear has aspects, you see.

Gregoire: Shri Mataji. That's why I've been saying since Sahasrara Day, that the most important thing that this year is bringing, through all your teachings, but at least since Sahasrara Day, is confidence as a Sahaja Yogi.
Shri Mataji: Confidence as a Sahaja Yogi.
You see now, some people are like- now say, I’ll say some people will think that, "Mother doesn't know much about banking. So you’ll be careful. Better tell her. So, better tell her about it". I'm quite good at banking. You see, now when I said, "Put it in platinum". You see, I knew what was going to happen.
[Laughter]
Now that time they said, "Mother, but platinum has gone down, this thing ". Now it's a- I know banking very well. That day they said, "Mother, there is no money in the bank or something". I said, "No, there must be so much, so much so". Exactly! Like that.
So, it is not. I know everything I know what’s happening. I know at the right time everything. But if you tell me, all right, I accept your solution, it doesn't matter. But that should not come from fear!
First of all, "No, Mother" should go away, I think, that is one thing you can decide. Not to say, start any sentence with, "No, Mother".
Let us start like that, maybe. Then, we’ll see.

So, some people think, I'm more knowledgeable in Kundalini, something I am more knowledgeable. And this and that. Like, our Pradhar [unsure] always managed to say that "Mother is the lawyer of lawyers". What’s the subtle of that, I know.

Gregoire: And perhaps also the gross, if you choose to Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: That's fine. You said the gross?
Gregoire: And perhaps also the gross if you choose to.
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course. Who's made the gross? So, I know, of course. It's no problem. I’m confidence personified. Why show like that? You say, I don't know banking. I don’t know this, that. Everything I try. But doesn’t matter, at the right time, I know everything what’s to be done.

[Shri Mataji asks for water in Hindi]
[Rustom proposes Coca-Cola. Shri Mataji wants water.]

Shri Mataji: Bern is a burning, a very burning place.
Gregoire: Bern is a burning place.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Right side burning and left side burning. What should I say?
Rustom: Then you should burn it all.
[Unclear conversations]
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: When I’m watching, big, big buses passing in a routine way, all empty. Nobody's going in them. In a routine way, they are going; just.
Arnaud: Oh, you did see them, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: One after another.
Arnaud: Oh, I see.
Shri Mataji: Without any anybody inside them.
Arnaud: Buses are going, you know, at a particular time, but empty.
Shri Mataji: It is because they are looking for us, you see.
[Laughter]
Warren: Systematise.
Rustom: Do you know Shri Mataji, you have a toilet for dogs here?
Shri Mataji: Really?
Rustom: Yes.
Gregoire: I can show it to you if you want Shri Mataji.
Everybody: No.
[Laughter]
Gregoire: No, but what I mean is that, from the window, there is a place in the garden that, they have fence. Then they have little poles in the middle, so the dog knows what to do. Then in the middle, they have a square with sand, and a shower. And everybody has to bring the dogs there. And I think this is madness, Shri Mataji.

Gregoire: Guido! You have not seen it, Guido.
[Laughter]
Kingsley: There is a little sign in there. A little picture of a dog on a pole and it leg.
Gregoire: And it shows to the dog how to do it on the picture, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: You are systematic. You always systematize everything. Worse are the Japanese in this matter. Japanese are so systematized. Bapre! [Unsure]. They have one fellow of Hitachi, he came to see me, the chairman of the Hitachi, it is such a big company. I was in a hotel. With a big white stuff, you see, like that, on his mouth [mask]. Like a [unclear] I said, "Now, what is that?"
Kalpana [unclear] they went inside. They couldn't bear it, you see. So, I said, "What’s the matter, sir? Are you hurt there?" "No, I've got a cold". If they have a cold, all right, put a big thing and go and [unclear].
Then we went to another place when we were supposed to be. Some people were supposed to go and see [unsure], myself, Kalpana and Sadhana. There were some other people with us. So, they had got [unclear], written on that: "Welcome Mrs Srivastava and daughters, Miss kalpana, Miss Sadhana", on the two banners. They carried on our heads and both the girls were dead to be chained [unsure].
[Laughter]

They could'nt lift their legs. They said, "What sort of a leg this, Mummy is, what is this?" I mean, such a system goes on. And now they have another thing. And you know, all these systems, anything you put in the system goes in the system.

She must have seen in this ‘Modern Times’ [Chaplin, 1938], a fellow fell into a thing, you see, into a machine. And he was going with the machine on, you see. Where ever the machine is, machine doesn’t [unclear].
Arnaud: Shri Mataji, this-
Shri Mataji: In the same way, what happens, that supposing- now for example, I'm just telling you how it is the whole machine thing works out. That we went to Camaron fishing. There's a fish called Cameron which they used to catch in olden times, you see. Now, they- somebody has put into their heads, "We should bring back all olden things. Natural things, we should eat. All-natural food, we should have". Gone in the machine now, it's working.

So, Cameron fishing we went to have, and this fishing of this Cameron, they used to light up something in front of the boat, some sort of a [unclear] like thing burning. And the fishes would come, and they would kill them, like this. There at least 50 boats, one of them was ours also. And 50 boats others. They had arranged this big Cameron fishing.
Not one fish was caught! Not one! But we did the whole stuff. And the regularization was like this, that when you go to that place ,where they had put these things up on our heads, you were supposed to wear kimonos, because you are now relaxing [in seaside resort]. So you’d better wear kimonos, no more dresses. So, they all wear kimonos. There special white with blue, blue things on them. Poor Mr Hill who had taken us there. He is tall about CP size, you see, and quite healthy.

The kimono was up to this.
[Laughter]
He's a traditional English man, you see. And he sits in the boat, you see. And he was so shy before me. He needed to wear this. He just said, "Horrible".
[Laughter]
He said, "Get me a towel. Towel".
[Unclear conversation]
And when they ask us, I said, "No, nothing doing. We are not going to wear those Kimonos. No, no, no, no. We just don't like". "No? "No, no, never [unclear]".
So you had to do everything and looking the same. Wear the kimono, Get into the boat. And catching not a single fish!
[Laughter]

The whole party! I mean they spend so much money going down there, for Camaron fishing. And the worse is now, another one called, "Just see, just see, just see!" Camaron fishing?
[Laughter]
