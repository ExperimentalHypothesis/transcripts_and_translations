Private conversations in Schwarzsee, 25 August 1986,

PART 1 (uncompleted)

Shri Mataji: Well, you see, he was most satisfied with London.
[Laughter]
He had to go away. He used to say, “Mother, I’ll never go out of London, never”. But in one day, he was completely thrown away.
Did you go after that bathroom? Not yet.
Sahaja Yogi: No, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Your father, he was talking about your father.

It’s a little shake is there. But I feel she’ll be all right, with her Mother herself, she will be all right.
Sahaja Yogi: She’s been sitting, just since we’ve been here, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Sahaja Yogi: Just since you’ve been here with Gregoire, she’s been sitting and starting to crawl and. Just in the last three or four weeks.

Shri Mataji: Never guessed. You want to have some tea yourself?
[About the daughter]
Shri Mataji: She is a South Indian? Yes. With an Indian face.
Sahaja Yogi: I thought Chinese.
Shri Mataji: South India. Ah, will you see this [unclear]. Like mine. She has an Indian face. [Shri Mataji speaks to the baby girl]
We came to see you only. 
[Laughter]
I don’t think there is any problem now, as such, except that a little bit time it takes to adjust, that’s all. I don’t think the way she is sitting, the way she is having, the whole time she has been sitting, you said. Remarkable, isn’t it?

Did you give her calcium?
Sahaja Yogini: We give her white cheese.
No, no. Give her calcium or something. It’s good for her, for bones. Rustom, you can get here some calcium.
Rustom: You get calcium drops for children.
Shri Mataji: Are there calcium drops?
Rustom: Hum. Also vitamin D she should get.
Sahaja Yogini: She has.
Shri Mataji: Vitamin D and calcium.
Rustom: Because there’s not much sun here.

PART 2 (uncompleted)

Warren: I see take the whole floor out and just put a little loft in, like this.
Shri Mataji: The loft, then what’s here? There is also higher loft. So, the height over that is about say 16 feet.
Warren: Oh! At least, Mother.
Shri Mataji: At least.
Sahaja Yogi/Warren: More because actually, your bedroom is about 13 or 14 feet. Actually, without that full ceiling. Then on top of that, there'll be another 9 feet. So, it be 30 it be 25, 20, 23.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, to reach the height, you can’t.
Sahaja Yogi: It will be more or less like this.
Warren: More or less like this. If it was done, it would be more or less, your bedroom would be a little higher than this. Perhaps.
Shri Mataji: I’s already about 8, 9 feet high.
Warren: Yes. There’ll be another foot on this, then the actual projection upwards would be like this. If I can just-
Shri Mataji: No, that’ll be much more, you see, about 8 feet of the height of the roof, plus the top.
Sahaja Yogi: Not 8 feet, Mother. It's about 7 foot the height to the existing ceilings, then on top of that, there's only about 7 feet.
Shri Mataji: So, about 14 feet or plus.
Warren: 14 and 25, 26 feet yes.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, what we can do by changing these [unclear] in my bedroom, a little higher [unclear]

Arnaud: Shri Mataji, one thing interesting about the Japanese people, when you mentioned the Japanese, today, they are just controlling all the financial world and they're just having the Americans on the neck it's absolutely unthinkable.
Sahaja Yogi: That's why this dollar is going down, Mother. England and America are sort of balancing together but Japan's up here. And Germany's up here and Switzerland is not far behind them.
Shri Mataji: Japan is going to be killed by its own inflation. It will be killed by its own inflation; you just don’t worry. You see, in their own country, the currency- to buy, say, what we buy in England for 1 pound, they have to spend 10 pounds, in their own country.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, that’s true.
Shri Mataji: It’ s like, you see. They say there are bricks of gold [Hindi]. In Lanka, there is the gold brick. Because, you see, like the exchange was done with not with rupees, but with gold bricks. One fellow thought he’ll go and earn a lot of money he went down there. And he made in one day, five bricks of gold. He said, "Why you go there? I am going to be rich now ". So next day, he went for his haircut and he had to pay one brick, finished! By the evening, all the bricks were spent out. And he loaned one to someone.
So, in international relationship maybe. But inflation in that country is so high now. If you want to buy a Japanese [unclear] set in Japan, it is 10 times more than in America.
Sahaja Yogi: They have no competition in Japan.
Shri Mataji: It is. Food is so expensive. My nephew was there, food is so expensive, that education so very expensive.
Sahaja Yogi: And housing also Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Housing is so expensive. I mean, it is a horrid place to live in. He could not save a single pai, he resigned now. He resigned from Shipping Corporation, just resign and came back. He just could not manage [unclear]. And he had at least 10 times more paid there.
Just like here. Rustom is telling me that on the average the salary of a person is 6,000 rupees. Our prime minister in India gets 5,000 rupees.
Sahaja Yogi: As a pilot in the Army, he has 6,000. But there are poor people Shri Mataji today. Shri Mataji: And they are poor people.
Sahaja Yogi: They don't have cloth.
Shri Mataji: You see.
Sahaja Yogi: They don't. To buy a single to top, Shri Mataji, for you, it cost them 300 rupees. Sahaja Yogi: It's all relative.
Arnaud: Is it the same here?
Gregoire: So, it is the same here. This artificial wealth is hiding the fact that it's all rubbish.
Shri Mataji: Russians are the wisest of the whole of you, I must say. They are the best.
They have the best of everything and they have got everything that is natural with them. They have gone to the third world, with all natural things to themselves. And they really having a nice time.

They have all beautiful carpets from India, beautiful embroided things, everything is nice. If to their houses, you never think they [unclear]. All the good wood work is with them. Everything they have got. They have exported, you see, all they have accepted because what you call that trade.
Gregoire: Trade barter system.
Shri Mataji: Barter system. The Swiss are very much against it, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah, really?
Sahaja Yogi: Bilateral goods trade.
Shri Mataji: You see and they going to be in trouble. You see, the Swiss are very poor, if you see them, they are very poor [unclear] in goods.
Gregoire: Of, course.
Shri Mataji: Very poor. Rustom, Gregoire. Sadhana had a visitor from Switzerland. And she was really aghast to see Sadhana's ornaments, which were not also, that she was using, not even from the bank [unclear] spoiled in the bank.
Gregoire: But it is true, Shri Mataji, because, you see, people, most people they have what they earn which is enough to carry the day, but they don't have any reserve.
Shri Mataji: You can’t buy anything.
Gregoire: They don't have. Arnaud and myself are good example Shri Mataji.
Sahaja Yogi: You can’t save.
Gregoire: We have.
Shri Mataji: But in America, it’s [unclear].
Gregoire: Thanks to ashram, thanks, I have been saving money since I left my house in Vienna, naturally, because if I live here-
Shri Mataji: You bought a house.
Gregoire: But if I have my own house I can't save the price, Shri Mataji.
Arnaud: Just one example: to move from one town to another town, because we had to go to Geneva, because there was no place no people in Geneva itself for meditation. No Sahaja Yogis, nothing. So we went to Geneva and all thing happened very sahaj, we got this flat for the time being. Just to move, I have to pay 4 to 5,000 Franks more a year, as taxes.
Gregoire: In rupees this is 20,000 rupees.
Arnaud: 20,000 rupees.
Gregoire: To move
Shri Mataji: It’s quite an artificial, this thing is. [Hindi]

[Unclear conversation]

Arnaud: Ashram is the best solution.
Sahaja Yogi: You can't buy property; we found out about that.
Sahaja Yogi: You can’t?
Sahaja Yogi: It's almost impossible to buy a house here.
Sahaja Yogi: Why?
Sahaja Yogi: Because you just pay back interest all the time. You can't pay off the capital because the interest is so high.

Shri Mataji: It’s not 7 feet, it is 8 feet about CP room’s height.
[About a photo] This is my in-law ... and this is my grand-children.
All right?
Sahaja Yogi: Which is, which one?
Shri Mataji: My room is 8 feet. Maybe little more. This could be 7 and half. This is my room, this one is, this is the-

[Conversation about measurements, the plans, low voices]
Sahaja Yogi: But I don't understand this part
Shri Mataji: So now, supposing you remove this, it is all together 22 feet. Now to raise this higher, what you have to do - [...]
[Many conversations at the same time]

Shri Mataji: So then, this if you can remove, you might get it higher.
Warren: You can take those two big beams out, big beams.
Shri Mataji: Four beams are there. You can put it up there
Warren: Relocate the big beams; and then put that across. From the same, I'm very much in favour of raising the height of your room.
Shri Mataji: Then you need not have it. Because that was the problem that's why we want to open it out. If it is permitted, then we’ll open it out, and it will be outside. But, as it is, if you raise it higher, there is more light.

Warren: In the Red Room in which you slept, there is about a 7-foot space in between. But above your ceiling, there is no space. You don’t have a reinforced ceiling in the Red room where you slept recently. It's about a 7-foot air gap.
Shri Mataji: That was broken.
Warren: But in the room in which you're going to sleep, your own room Mother, there is no gap. Those beams are the things on which the floor of the next ceiling.
Shri Mataji: I don't know why they
Sahaja Yogi: Somehow, they've done it like that. I don't understand it either.

Shri Mataji: You should better, you see [unclear].
Warren: If you look from the back of the house, when you're looking standing out in the garden, you can actually see the two levels change and the windows are at different heights; funny business.
Shri Mataji: We can do like this no problem.
Warren: It would be a good idea.
Shri Mataji: Like this but, it should not be showing in my room.
Warren: No, no. It won't show in your room. It will just make it higher.
Shri Mataji: Then only this problem is that of the height of which two people felt about my room, it is [unclear]. It’s very simple.
Warren: It's easy to achieve in the Red Room in your room we have to actually intrude into the attic.
Shri Mataji: Yes. And then you get the same height, you see.
Warren: Then you can have your chandelier.
Shri Mataji: Hum, then I can have.

Warren: The theory of the ‘watch this point’. He shouldn't go too far with the electricals.
Shri Mataji: In my room, he should forget this lamp. How is it in [unclear]? Nothing will matter in the lower part of it, only when it goes to one part, it is [unclear] part. It is not so difficult. This can be done in one day no problem.

Warren: Only thing, I didn't realize was there was seven and seven, 14 feet, from there to there.
Shri Mataji: No, because you go and stand underneath.
Warren: Yes, I'm with you. From the tippy, tippy top here.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is about 3 feet or four. No, this is about- it comes out as a dog, about 4 feet this one. This is the dog, about 4 feet, on top of that. Of course, seven.
Warren: Yes, correct.
Shri Mataji: Even if you have it up to this, it will be 8 feet height.
But if you going to put them up like that you see, like that and like that.
Warren: Bear them exposed.
Shri Mataji: And he's very anxious that we should put the exposed peace. Let’s see.
Warren: Well, it's a good idea, Mother. It gives the impression of space. You see, here, if you look from here, you can see an example, a perfect example.

It gives the impression of space. This is exactly as the attic is in your house. See those cross beams? I was walking on those beams when I was in the laundry, because there was a ceiling there. Actually, but actually –
[Gregoire speaks to Shri Mataji]

It gives the impression of space. This is exactly as the attic is in your house. See those cross beams? I was walking on those beams when I was in the laundry, because there was a ceiling there. Actually, but actually –
[Gregoire speaks to Shri Mataji]

The projection gives you the impression of space.
Shri Mataji: It’s true. No, these, of course, these are different. But he was saying also the slopy ones. You see, there are two types see there, see now. This one is one, one is, from here it starts, you see? These. Then they go up like that.
Warren: That's right.
Shri Mataji: So, these also, he was saying, should be exposed.
Warren: That's correct, yes. I'm saying that- oh, you're saying even more than this by showing the beans themselves.
Shri Mataji: Not only this, you are talking only about these.
Warren: So, in other words, It’s not lining up, but exposing the beams themselves.
Shri Mataji: No, lining, but between the beams.
Warren: Yes, between that's all right. This is neater and it's less work. This is easier job. The other is a big job because you have to cut lots and lots of little pieces and fit them in. But it doesn't matter.
Shri Mataji: Which is the big one?
Warren: The way you are suggesting, Mother, with the fitting little pieces in.
Shri Mataji: Then we can also put there those glass things.
Warren: Yes. Oh, you can put glass things in these. They've got examples in this house. You can still put the glass panels in, that's no problem.
Shri Mataji: On the top?
Warren: That’s no problem. Even in this house, they've got - I looked out the window - they've got big glass panels running in these houses. I'm surprised they haven't got any here.
Sahaja Yogi: On the other side you mean the window’s top.
Warren: Windows in the roof.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, there’s two.
Warren: In the roof, in the actual roof.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Gregoire: Yes, it’s on the other side.

Shri Mataji: Here if you make a window, it will make it weak, Warren. [unclear]
Warren: In this part, yes.

Shri Mataji: So, you like the exposed beans, Rustom?
Rustom: Exposed beans are fine, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: But looks rustic. So, let us make the upper part rustic. Let us make the children's thing rustic.
Gregoire: It's very cozy, Shri Mataji. If you would like to have a feeling of the place, perhaps you would like to just go up and see. It makes a very cozy feeling.
Shri Mataji: Children like it that's what I’m saying.
Gregoire: Yes.
Rustom: For you, Shri Mataji, I had one idea, that if you have a flat ceiling, it is better for a lady’s rooms.
Shri Mataji: No this is mine. You see, the thing is, [Marathi], raise it, that’s all.

Rustom: Then it’s much better.
Shri Mataji: No this is mine. You see, the thing is, [Marathi],
Rustom: Then it's okay.
Shri Mataji: They can have, they can have a rustic one.

Rustom: When I was a child, Shri Mataji, I used to enjoy these things.
Shri Mataji: Let them have the rustic things. We'll give them everything rustic.
Rustom: Also they’ll feel relaxed, Shri Mataji. Children don't like fussy things.
Warren: The absolutely plain, blank surfaces, they don't like either. Something which has a little change.
Rustom: Yes.
Shri Mataji: All right. We’ll make it rustic.

Rustom: Your ceiling should be well done.
Shri Mataji: Oh, that's all right. My ceiling is done. We are going to raise my ceiling. But then on top, whether to have the rustic- rustic is better.
Sahaja Yogi: If you have an English House of that age, Shri Mataji, certainly the woodwork inside is quite magnificent and strong.
Shri Mataji: They are very good.
Sahaja Yogi: And it is very valuable. It gives a terrific character in English house of that age.
Rustom: The only one could say, Shri Mataji-
Shri Mataji: And also I can get some nice carving, to put on them. It looks very interesting.
Sahaja Yogi: And brass, brass work.
Shri Mataji: [Marathi], we can get things from antics. In India, you get lots of things.

Rustom: You should have good insulation.
Shri Mataji: [Marathi].
Warren: You still have to have some of these cross tiles.
Shri Mataji: That will be part of the scaffolding. But whether the scaffolding should be exposed or not, is the point. Now as we have decided to have a rustic, you see, the get up of the house is majestic and more classical, you see. But the upper part, we can make it rustic.
Lower part is classical. Upper part to be rustic for the children. They like it.

Gregoire: It’s Ekadesha Rudra, Shri Mataji, isn’t it?
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gregoire: Ekadesha.
Shri Mataji: Ekadesha. Sahasrara.
Gregoire: Is it this place? Is this Burn’s?
Shri Mataji: No, no, this is the child [unclear]
Have you open my window in my room? You see, I wanted air to come in quite a lot. And oxygen is less, you see, at a height. You have less oxygen. It leaves your rooms closed also. There's no way of getting oxygen inside.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, wider, Shri Mataji. Ruth is very good with windows.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Now, can I ask one question? How much rent do we pay for this apartment?
Sahaja Yogi: It's about uh 2,000 Swiss Francks, a month, Shri Mataji. In pounds it's about,
Shri Mataji: One thousand?
Sahaja Yogi: 800 pounds a month.
Gregoire: It's not considered as expensive because if it would be in Geneva, it would be the double. Geneva is the most expensive place in Europe.

Guido: Like our ashram.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Guido: Like our ashram.
Shri Mataji: Which one?
Guido: Our ashram, in Rome, is nearly the same price of this flat.
Shri Mataji: My house in this thing is so big. You have seen that house now in Diallage [unsure], we are paying 13 hundred pounds.
Gregoire: 13 hundred pounds?
Shri Mataji: 13 hundred pounds.

Guido: We are living 51 people now there. We don't have any more private room, I mean, boys on one side and ladies on the other side. We don't have a husband and wife, we have not there. Because now it's emergency.

Shri Mataji: It's a very good way of doing that house, you see. And that's same style, I'm going to use in this house also, that we make lofts, halfway lofts. So, children can also sleep in the halfway lofts and also the [Unclear].
Waren: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So, there's a halfway loft, I’m going to have this. Like this. It’s very short.
Waren: In the long part of the house, we can put a halfway loft.
Gregoire: Yes. That's so cosy. There is an element of fun also. It’s a Swiss chalet.
Waren: It won't have any much height but it will be good. It will be lovely for the children. Shri Mataji: For children that is fine.
Warren: They can sleep upstairs.
Shri Mataji: Small children can sleep upstairs.
Waren: They can play on the on the lower level. It'll be a miniature of this room.
Shri Mataji: But you could have like this also if you want to cover. But you don't want to cover, then you can have just that. That would be something like their style, you see the rustic style.
Gregoire: This place, Shri Mataji is- but this is Italy, I would say, Shri Mataji, in Italy the Gruha Lakshmi or the Lakshmi is still there. First of all, the food is extremely good. In every restaurant, you can go, you are sure to get good.
Here, Shri Mataji, it is such to go out for lunch at noon. I have to go because I cannot sit 8 hours in my office, I get crazy. I have to go out but it is such a [unclear] in a restaurant. It's like putting that stuff within yourself. But in Italy, it's completely different. You enjoy eating. There is still something in the food. This is one thing. Then they have a lot of nice things which are not expensive, much more creative. Here for anything, Shri Mataji, you have to pay such a lot. It's ridiculous. A scratch, just a little scratch in the body of the car, costs you, a scratch, cost you 400 Swiss Francs. A scratch! If you have to fix it because of...
Shri Mataji: [Unsure] Yanka is so late to eat, they say so. In Yanka, there is [unclear] That's what it is.

I used to wonder why these ambassadors get such high pay and they have no money. But I don’t know money. Whatever they have got, it is in their own family like, it’s their savings. We too have saved our money not because of any this thing, only because I have been building houses after houses. Otherwise, we would have saved no money.
Gregoire: Because that's the way you regenerate capital.
Shri Mataji: Now CP, he just gets 4,000 pounds.
Gregoire: 4,000?
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Rustom: I was getting that, Shri Mataji.
Gregoire: Where? In Saudi Arabia?
Rustom: Hum.
Gregoire: You get 4,000 pounds a month.
Rustom: I used to get it before the riyals [unclear].

Gregoire: You see, Shri Mataji, what I get with a family of three children, is 6,000 Swiss Francs.
Shri Mataji: It's how much pounds.
Rustom That's about 12,000 riyals.
Shri Mataji: For a year?
Rustom: Per month.
Gregoire: No per month.
Sahaja Yogi: 2,400 pounds.
Gregoire: 2,400 per month. It's not a bad salary as such. But with the cost of living, you.
Shri Mataji: But I tell you with 4,000 also. Now see, 1,300 are going into just [unclear] with the thing. Electricity, gas. Our house is a big household, it's not a small household. All the time, we have –
Gregoire: He has no allowances, plus this?
Shri Mataji: I don't know but that's what he told me. I don't know.
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, I mean, I don't Know.
Shri Mataji: He might be getting entertainment allows. But that is spend, over spend always from his salary. Now I mean, I just don't know how people can save money.
Gregoire: It's not bad Shri Mataji, because the head of certain agencies have the house provided. His residence is not provided? Because the head of the atomic agency, he has his residence provided.
Shri Mataji: Not anymore. So many people don’t have such things. You see, this fellow had, this UNESCO fellow. And they made such a big thing out of that.
Gregoire: He has a very bad reputation, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Gregoire, you see, it was built before he went. If you want to malice somebody, you can go. How can you go on explaining? This was built in the building itself. The whole building for UNESCO was created. In that, the flat was created for this one. And then when he came, he lived there. But other agencies don't have the house.
I don't know, but when it came out, the first thing when he was appointed, it was written that a house is given to me also. But I don't know. I never got a house from this. How are we to find out?
Gregoire: This, Shri Mataji, I can try to find out
It's probably different from one agency to another, Shri Mataji. Because I just find out that you are not getting any allowance for your private residence. And I'm certain that, for instance, that the man from the atomic agency, he gets private allowance. And even the UNIDO director he gets quite a lot of money it was passed by the board.
Shri Mataji: Really?
Gregoire: Yes. It was passed by the board of the of the United Nation industrial organization.
Shri Mataji: If he were getting then CP would not have gone in for house like this. He would have gone in for an expensive house. It doesn’t matter.
Gregoire: It's a small agency Shri Mataji, that’s why.
Shri Mataji: Maybe that.

Now 134 nations.
Gregoire: Yes, but the size of the- it's one of the smallest agencies in the system.
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can say that way.
Gregoire: Because UNESCO or FAO, they are 4,000 people, you know.
Shri Mataji: FAO, UNESCO, UNDP.

It's very funny because now, supposing we go to America, [unclear]. If you are a diplomat, you get a card and you get a, you don't have to pay the- what you call-
Rustom: The VAT [Value Added Tax].
Shri Mataji: The VAT. But not us.
Gregoire: You have to pay the VAT?
Shri Mataji: Always paid.
They say, "There is a card you have to get from the UN ". And they don't give it to us. The UN people should give it to us.

Gregoire: You have an official car?
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: Card, card.
Shri Mataji: CI Card. You get a card for VAT function.
Gregoire: And you didn't get, you don’t get it.

Strange. This must have happened when the British negotiated the seat agreement with IAMO at that time, long time back.
Shri Mataji: Long time back.
Gregoire: Long time back. Because it sounds strange to me. In Austria, I could get after P5, I think. People could get –
Shri Mataji: No, no. VAT in London, we get all right. No VAT in America. Anywhere else I can get, not in America.
Gregoire: Not in America. I mean, in America, think they're tougher than everywhere else. I would not get any privilege if I will.
Shri Mataji: I just don't know. Because [unclear] Not even ambassadors. We are also UN, part of the UN. It’s surprising.
Gregoire: So, ambassadors they give [unclear]
Shri Mataji: Anywhere. Every country they give ambassadors. Except in our own country, India. And in UK also we can get VAT. Now what about the VAT? Are we to pay VAT to this man? No?
Guido: No, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: We are not paying any VAT [unclear].
Guido: Yes, Shri Mataji. Gregoire will be corresponding the amount we are giving him in pounds, in travel checks. So, it will make the correspond little bit less.
Shri Mataji: But it should be done. You see, because before, within one year's time, I cannot take it to India. So as soon we do, the better, in a way.
Guido: We can organize uh by the 10th of September. We can organize by the 10th of September. So, if there is any lorry going to London with the bathrooms and so on, we can put.
Shri Mataji: Maybe do that.
Guido: Yes.

Shri Mataji: It’s very close to Milano.
Guido: It’s quite close, Shri Mataji. I already spoke with the man. And to them, it’s same thing deliver to Rome or deliver to Milano.
Shri Mataji: Then if you can't send it to Milano, then all the things are there.
Guido: Yes, Shri Mataji. Now the only thing now we have to give time to change the colour of some items. But I think they can do it quite fast.

Shri Mataji: Is there more duty for things that you get from Italy to Ganga?
Sahaja Yogi: It’s common market.
Shri Mataji: It’s common market. Not in India.
Sahaja Yogini: It's different it's different VAT from one country.
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?
Sahaja Yogini: It is different VAT from one country of the common market with the other one. They have not yet unified the level of VAT.
Shri Mataji: Are you sure?
Sahaja Yogi: That's not VAT we're talking about duty, customs duty.
Sahaja Yogini: There should not be.
Sahaja Yogi: VAT is local tax [unclear]. Custom duty into England.
Shri Mataji: I’m saying customs.
Gregoire: Within the common market?
Sahaja Yogini: They should not be but then they invent other things to still impose duty. But they should not be theoretically. But then they ask lots of paper, they might ask lots of paper say, "This is not allowed entrance in England because".
Shri Mataji: No, but I would give my passport.
Sahaja Yogini: Oh yes, then it’s fine.
Gavin: In diplomatic case, Mother, there's no question. But if you don't want to involve CP-
[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: They try to show off [unclear] "Very difficult problems".
Gregoire: That's the essence of it. That's the essence of it. "This very important meeting". And this, "Your very lucid statement" and "the important recommendation that we have put forward".
Shri Mataji: We are legally, we are legally entitled.

Gregoire: A funny thing, Shri Mataji, is that while driving back from Shudy Camps. It’s not so interesting, I just mentioned to you. They saw your- we were driving on the highway, and there was a police car and they stopped us. And he was quite rude and-
Shri Mataji: Today?
Gregoire: No, no, when I came back from Shudy Camps.
Gavin: In your car.
Gregoire: In your car. No, I had driven the first half and then I was tired. So, the second half I had asked Mathias, no sorry, Marcus to drive. So, the guy asked him, "You don't have the right to drive this car and so on". Then I got up from the back seat, and I said, "This is perfectly all right and I showed my diplomatic passport". Then they went back in the in the Jeep and he looked at all the rules and regulations. And he told me- he is a stupid fellow because he didn't see that my passport had nothing to do with UK, you know. He is stupid. But then he said, "You should know". So, he assumed it was my car like that. He said, "You should know that you are not entitled to let anyone else drive this car these are the rules and regulation of this country that you should respect". I said, "Yes, sir, yes, sir. Thank you sir". Because I didn't want to create any problem and we drove. It was completely off his head. That's nice little example of bureaucrat. But actually, if I would not have a diplomatic passport, they would have made a fuss and annoyed Mr Srivastava.
Gavin: There is a bureaucratic rule that says that nobody but a diplomat or his driver, his paid driver, should drive a diplomat car. That is the rule.

Shri Mataji: Or any driver [unclear]. That’s right.

Still there. Do a bandhan to that child
Gregoire: Inès or Shalini?
Shri Mataji: Shalini. What did they call her?
Gregoire: Inès.
Shri Mataji: Inès. What does that mean?
Gregoire: It’s a Spanish name.
Sahaja Yogini: Lamb.
Shri Mataji: What?
Sahaja Yogini: Lamb.

Shri Mataji: What does Agnes [Ag-ness] mean? Agnes.
Gregoire: Agnès?
Sahaja Yogini: It’s the same, it’s the same the same root, Shri Mataji. [Means pure; chaste]
Gregoire: Niranjana, you please be quiet. I just feel the Ekadesha Rudra, Shri Mataji.
Rustom: I feel Kundalini, Swadisthana, both.
Gavin: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Gavin: It’s every chakra, actually. They're all going like that.
It's the whole vertebral column. That's why I told him the head, it's Sahasrara.
Gregoire: But this is anti-God, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: She never [unclear] warm because of it. But she got her Realization, it was the only thing I had as a good favour. I mean, favour even before that she got her Realisation. She was not a born Realised, I think. He gave her Realisation.
Gregoire: To whom?
Arnaud: You mean to Shalini?
Shri Mataji: Yes. I don't know whether she was, because she had no vibrations when she came.
Arnaud: Shri Mataji, I remember that once I came to the hospital two days after the birth, I was not enthusiastic, I didn't come to the hospital. But just once, after she was about to die, I came and I give vibrations to her. It was the only time.
Shri Mataji: Hum? She was going to die?
Arnaud: She was about to die.
Shri Mataji: Who? This child? What?
Arnaud: Yes. She had something in the stomach. They lifted her.
Gregoire: The nurse put her in the wrong way, so the milk went into the lungs.

Shri Mataji: Oh. That was the reason they gave [unclear]?
Gregoire: Then they gave her antibiotics. At the age of two, three days.
Shri Mataji: They attack her heart.
Gregoire: Yes. It was at the age of two, three days, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Heart is very big. You must it to some [unclear]. How do you know she had a heart trouble?
Gavin: Paediatrician, with paediatrician.
Shri Mataji: How the nurse could do that? You should pursue her.
Arnaud: But it was something amazing because she did know. It was when she had to go in the elevator at the moment, there was sort of a little shake, you know, because it was not on the same level, when she brought her on the elevator. And at the moment where she brought the little plan on this part, it gave a little shock. And at that moment exactly, she swelled out.

Shri Mataji: Maid.
Arnaud: Yes.
Shri Mataji: How she was ?
Arnaud: I don't know.
Shri Mataji: There was a bottle in there [unsure].

Arnaud: No, no, but she had the thing, I had the feeling she made a ‘renvoi’ [French word for vomit] she made a vomit and at exactly the same moment, it gave this shock.
Shri Mataji: And she was unsure.
Gregoire: Yes, she has fired the ...
Shri Mataji: Ans she was [unclear]. I think so because it’s rather sordid.
Rustom: Shri Mataji, Amelia said that apparently this child also has the same problem at the hips as Ruth's baby.
Shri Mataji: Who?
Rustom: Marie-Laure’s child. She has the same problem at the hips, as Ruth’s baby.
Shri Mataji: Really? When she was born.
Arnaud: Yes, this was the report of the doctor.
Sahaja Yogi: They will have to put also a harness?

Sahaja Yogini: She’s not sure yet.
Sahaja Yogini: She said it was not so serious.
Arnaud: But she wanted to hide it.

Gregoire: Is it too salty, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: [Unclear] get some oil.
Gregoire: It’s a bit too dry.
Shri Mataji likes, you know, juicy food, moist food she said this so many times.
Rustom: You could put also some olive oil, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You put some olive oil.

Arnaud: So, Shri Mataji, the whole thing was very dramatic; all the whole thing.
Shri Mataji: The father had no feeling for the child [unsure]. She said, "I was the first holding the baby in my hands". For 11 minutes or 12 minutes, she got [unclear].
Arnaud: You know why? Because Phil was blocked the jam. So he could not be there at the moment of the birth. Because Marie-Amelia has the flat very close to the hospital. She went to this Hospital.
Shri Mataji: And she had a caesarean.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: That [unclear].
Arnaud: She had infected- she had problems, a lot of problems afterwards.
[Unclear conversation]
Shri Mataji: She’s very normal. Radhika! Hello?

Rustom: This thing is quite strange. It has to be eaten with pepper and lemon juice on things.
[Unclear conversations about food]
Shri Mataji: Fish shouldn't be too dry. And people eat here very dry food.
Rustom: Not enough fat. They don't have fat in it.
[Unclear conversations about food]
Shri Mataji: If you eat fat food, this is all right.
Rustom: It’s fine, no problem.
Shri Mataji: No problem. [unclear] carbohydrate.
Gregoire: You know, [unclear] start this carbohydrate diet, no carbohydrate at all, only proteins.
Shri Mataji: This is done by a Sahaja Yogini, this one?
Sahaja Yogini: By my mother, Shri Mataji.

[Unclear conversations during food]
Sahaja Yogini: Chicken with sauce.
Shri Mataji: Chicken with sauce.
[Unclear conversations during food]

Kingsley: She's a Beauty when she smiles.
Shri Mataji: The smile is the child protocol [unclear].
[Laughter]
[Unclear conversation]

Shri Mataji: She was very fond of children [unclear]. The name of the child is Toby [unsure].That child it is, you know, the same face, don't you think?
Kingsley: Yes, yes. And the wonderful thing is, of course Shri Mataji, I have no more attachment, you know, since a long time for Toby which is good because that situation, of course, is disastrous.
Shri Mataji: Disastrous. I mean you were quite attached to him and well-meaning. It was good because he was a Realized soul. It’s a good child. But horrible woman, the mother.
Kingsley: It's very tragic, Shri Mataji. I heard a report from a third party, who vaguely knew my ex-wife. Only about a year ago, he telephoned me in Strasbourg. And he said that he had met my ex-wife and the little boy. And the little boy was running around in the street barefoot.
Sahaja Yogini: In winter.
Kingsley: In Winter. And when he said to this horrible woman, hello, she said, "Who are you? " He said, "I have an old friend of King. She said, "Oh, don't talk about him " and walked off in disgust.
Shri Mataji: Poor that child.
Kingsley: But the poor little boy!

Shri Mataji: You should pick him up.
Kingsley: He was lovely, wasn't he? Beautiful child.
Shri Mataji: Oh God! Horrible mother here. The father is not there.
Kingsley: Totally irresponsible, Shri Mataji. A drug dealer without any interest in his child at all.

Shri Mataji: Such a beautiful child like that. You know, you feel so surprised at that.
Kingsley: It's extraordinary when you see the parents, Shri Mataji. Two very ugly people and this beautiful little boy.
Shri Mataji: Beautiful child, beautiful child.
Kingsley: Whose child?
Shri Mataji: Really God sent him the way you [unclear]. I used to have a feeling for that child very much. Still I ask people, "How is he?"
[Unclear]. But what to do? This woman won't give him up.
Kingsley: There’s no chance in law, Shri Mataji. If I had thought that there was a chance, if I had thought I could even expose her and say, "Look at this woman and take him away". I mean. But because of her,
Shri Mataji: She was a drug addict, I think. Was she?
Kingsley: It's hard to say what she was Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: That’s what she was.
Kingsley: I mean, she was, as we say, clay in The Potter's hands. If a man came along and said, "Do this!" She'd do it, you know. I mean she had absolutely no roots at all.
Shri Mataji: Then let her go. I know. A hypocrite, such a hypocrite! But Toby, I did feel and I also feel that you were looking after him. He’ll come up. And what must be his age now?
Kingsley: He must be five or six now, Shri Mataji. I've kind of lost track. Yes he'll be six this year? 1980 he was born see I think.
Shri Mataji: Let’s see and ask, if you can find out. I mean, they don't even give up, you see. They use the child for oppressing. You see, they enjoy that. Why don't they give up their children? They kill their children, strangle their children, do all kinds of things, you know, in England. Why don't they give their children to somebody?

Kingsley: She couldn't discipline him, Shri Mataji. For instance, at one point, he took to doing his business under a table. And she used to laugh! And I used to say to her, you know, this is ridiculous.
Shri Mataji: Well, that not the [unclear]. But she should not use him for her sadistic things. But there is no arrangement, I must say, there, in that country. And I asked some people, you see, they are fed up of their child, somehow. I said, "Why don't you send them to an orphanage?" They said, "There’s nothing".

Kingsley: Whatever the state of the parent, the relationship is held to be absolutely sacred and holy, even if the parent is a complete devil.
That parent has the primordial right to do with the child as he wishes. Until someone comes along and says, "Oh he's beating him". And as you know, there have been so many cases of child abuse.
Shri Mataji: Every day, every day, two, three children are killed. Every day! It's a common thing. But leave alone that, what I'm trying to say, supposing if some parents do not like their children, it is very absurd, but supposing, there is no even place where they can put their children.
Gregoire: Yes, there are Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: No, no. Not in England.
Gregoire: Orphanage?
Kingsley: It doesn't work. It's not in England
Shri Mataji: It’s not existing.
Gavin: It's an old-fashioned idea. It doesn't exist anymore.
Kingsley: Yes. But if you said that, if you it in public that, "I don't like my child I give it to [unclear]" I mean, it be a human cry, you see.
Shri Mataji: They will kill the child. I mean, one child was put in the attic, tied up, with everything in the mouth. He just died.
