When I was small, my mom used to say the Ganeshwara Sishya and Devi Kavach all the time, so I really enjoyed saying them. Since I enjoyed this, I worshipped Shri Ganesha and the Devi.

When I was in school, first my sister got her Realization, and then we used to go to the center. I just felt so much enjoyment at the center—I don't know, it was very nice, peaceful, and happy. We didn't meet Shri Mataji straight away, but after a few months, She came to Pune. At that time, it was the Shri Ganesha Puja. My sister went to where Mother was staying; she went there and met Mother. When she came home, she said, "I saw Shri Mataji," and was telling me all about the joy. Inside my mind, I said, "I must go and see Shri Mataji."

The second day, I just said to my mom, "I'm going today to meet Shri Mataji. Don't wait for me." At that time in Pune, there was so much traffic because it was when they were installing the Ganesh statues, so there were traffic jams everywhere. I went by myself, alone, and I just said inside, "I want to meet Shri Mataji, and without meeting Her, I will not come back home."

I got the address and I went there. I decided I wouldn't knock, but I just went and stood outside the door and prayed to Mother inside. Then some foreigner came and opened the door, so I followed him. I went to the sitting room where there were Mother's photographs and everything. Inside, I was just saying, "Shri Mataji, please, I want to see you today, to meet you." Another lady came and asked me so many questions, like "How long have you known your God?" this and that. I was just giving her answers, but she said, "No, tomorrow is the Puja. You can meet Her there." But I didn't say anything; I just stood there, praying inside.

In a little while, Shri Mataji came there and She sat on the sofa. Then Yogi Mahajan and others were there, and they were offering all this Durva, the green things they offer to Shri Ganesha, for the Puja. Shri Mataji was chatting with us, and I just felt so much tremendous joy. I think this was in '83 or something. That was a really great experience.

After a few years, Shri Mataji was in Pratisthan. At that time, my sister's marriage was arranged, so I went there to give Her the invitation. Mother said, "I can't come, but I can send some Sahaja Yogis," because She said there would be so much of a crowd there. I was still very new at that time. Then She sent lots of foreigners. She called my husband "John" before he even came for the marriage. She said, "You know, the girl who is getting married has a sister. If you like, you can get married to her." And that's how our marriage was decided, and we got married.

Interviewer's comment: So you went to give Shri Mataji the marriage invitation for your sister, and then you got married? How good is that!

After that, when I first went to Italy, I used to cook for Shri Mataji. One day, Shri Mataji said, "We are going for a picnic." I said, "Okay." Mother's granddaughter liked keema, which is a kind of minced lamb, and some parathas. I was just by myself in the kitchen when Mother suddenly came. She said, "Come on, I can show you how to make the keema."

She had me chop a little garlic, ginger, and small onions. She put some oil in the pot and some garam masala, ginger, and garlic. But She didn’t put it on the stove; She just held the pot, telling me to please take some cloths. Then She fried the garlic and onion, then She put in the keema and cooked it. She put some on my hand and said, "How does it taste?" I said, "It's such a tremendous thing." The keema She made was really beautiful.

I used to go... Mother showed me how to make her bed and everything. And when She would sometimes wash Her hair, we would dry Her hair with ajwain dhuni. It was such a tremendous thing, you know, just very gentle.

Interviewer's comment: How did you feel when you washed Mother's hair?

No, no, we didn't wash Mother's hair. When Mother washed Her hair, we would dry it with the ajwain. We had to be really careful because sometimes it gets noisy and things, but it was such a tremendous experience. And when Mother showed me how to make the bed and all this, I just watched because I didn't know how to make a bed in the Western style. She just showed me, and it was such a tremendous, joyful thing.
