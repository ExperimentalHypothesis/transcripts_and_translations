Talk to Austrian Sahaja Yogis, Cairo (Egypt) October 30th, 1996

Shri Mataji: I'm here only for 5 minutes more. How many photographs you have taken? I don't see them. You see, so many take my photograph. Actually, I'm the greatest photographed person.[Laughter].But I don't see those photographs. So, they should be sent to some –Sahaja Yogi: We send it to Joffrey [unclear].Shri Mataji: Somebody who can pass it on to me.Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, Joffrey from England, he's collecting all these negatives. We handed it over to him and he makes it out of CDs he said.Shri Mataji: He keeps all of them with himself. He never showed me.Sahaja Yogi: Hopefully not [Laughter]. I don't think so.Shri Mataji: He came down to see me. He never showed me any photographs. I told this, "What is this you're getting all the negatives and the rest? I have not seen the photographs".Sahaja Yogi: He thought, he contacted me about two weeks ago. And I sent all my slides and negatives ahead to him to Cabella, to just go through them, put them into some system or so and he said then he will return it. But I can send you all the photographs and videos whatever it is there, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: No, no, but why should you lend negative, you can give photographs.Sahaja Yogi: OK.Shri Mataji: All right. Each one should take negative. We can make copies.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, yes.Shri Mataji: He's a nice Sahaja Yogi. He is a very good Sahaja Yogi, no doubt. But he's not yet shown me any photograph. So, I'm going to tell him that, "Please, show me first".

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, we have one Yogi in Austria who has a complete container of photos from you. Yes, I have seen it two weeks ago. I didn't know it myself. [Laughter]Shri Mataji: So, I told you.Sahaja Yogi: Yes. It is Willie, Willly Prayna. It’s a thick one. Really he made he made such a great work, you can't imagine. He has a complete container, like in office.Another Sahaja Yogi: A full shelf.Sahaja Yogi: Shelves.Shri Mataji: Where, in Austria?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: It’s all in Austria?Sahaja Yogi: Yes. I was standing there. I could not believe it. One photo after another, and done and done and done. And packages! Not one. For each one, he has 10 or 20.He is doing such a great job.Shri Mataji: Hope he has [unclear]. [Laughter]Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: He has got [unclear].[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: All right. So, now what to do with this container one? Now you could send some of them, you see, at least a copy. So, you could see yourself.I know, because at every puja, there are at least 50 people. If not 50, it would be 100. And they are all taking photographs.You have an exhibition of those. These are photographs or negatives?Sahaja Yogi: Photographs. Both, photographs, negatives, everything.Shri Mataji: All kinds.Another Sahaja Yogi: Whatever negatives, he gets from Austrians, he just takes them man makes - I mean, quite an enormous number of photographs out of it.So, all different sizes. So, then it takes to Cabella and then he just sells it there to Yogis. So, but if you want Shri Mataji, we can make a full album, whatever we have, to give it to you.Shri Mataji: He is selling them.Sahaja Yogi: No, no. Yes, but he doesn't make profit out of it. Just to recover the cost.Shri Mataji: Then it’s all right. You're not supposed to sell.Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, I have a very big vision inside of me. We should send all these photos - I want that all the journalists and all the newspapers and press agencies, they should get your photos. With your permission, we will send it to them.Shri Mataji: All of them?Sahaja Yogi: Sure, we can.Shri Mataji: I know one by one.Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: In this one, see the photograph, the other day, when I arrived at the airport. What a nice photograph it is. You saw this? Very nice. I was quite tired also. But I look quite fresh, you know. To convince people that I'm tired.[Laughter]

All right. I’m thinking, I will just go around the market, just to give some vibrations, because the whole day is lying there. And it would be nice. We have come to Egypt to give some vibrations after all.I've been here before, twice. You met such a nice man, you know, this journalist. Have you taken his address?Sahaja Yogi: Sure.

In all this, whatever has happened, we found some nice people. I am sure we’ll be able to work out. Ask him the address of that General also.Sahaja Yogi: The general? I have it.Shri Mataji: You have?Sahaja Yogi: Yes. I'm dealing with since 5 years.

Shri Mataji: Such a [unclear].

Djamel: Shri Mataji, whenever you are ready, the car is ready.Sahaja Yogi: Car is ready.Shri Mataji: For what?Djamel: To go to the market.

Shri Mataji: All right. May God bless you.May God bless you.

Anyone of you coming to India?Sahaja Yogi: Maybe some of some of us.

Shri Mataji: ‘Atcha’ [Hindi].Sahaja Yogini: I hope I can come.Shri Mataji: Oh, you see there’s for people from Israel, it's free. If you are you coming, you have to just pay your ticket, that’s all. But you send your name, first of all, that’s all. For people who are from Israel. And also from Russia. Russians, also, they pay very little. But otherwise, everything is free. All right?Sahaja Yogi: Thank you very much.[Cut in the video]

Shri Mataji [to the boy]: what? A train? I don't know if I can get a good train for you here. That's in Germany. We'll see, we'll see.I will see. I don't think they have very good machinery goods here. I’ll see whatever I get, all right?[End of video]
