I bow to all the seekers of Truth. Just now in the television, they asked me a question. That how many, there are so many people why have they come here? I said, in the modern times, there has been a category of people who are born who are seeking Truth. A poet hundred years back or Willium Blake has called them as ‘Men of God will be coming and they will themselves become saints and they will have power to make others saints’. So, you are here to know the Truth. The Truth that is absolute. For example, in these modern times we have so many choices. The machinery has brought out so many things, the science has given so many alternatives. Also, we do not know how far it go. People follow different ideologies and different religions but they find that no religion can stop them from doing something sinful or wrong. So one realizes that there is some sort of a mistakes somewhere and the mistake is very simple that UNCLEAR[] all religions you must seek the eternal and keep the transitory in its own limitations. All the religions have said that you have to be born again and you have to know yourself. But it does not work out. In every religion there is fight going on. They follow the same prophet, the same person but still there is a fight gong on. And if it is the truth, how can you fight? So we come to the point that is we have to be born again. That means we have to jump into a new awareness. It is not some artificial time of certificate that we are born again, but in reality, something has to happen to us that we should become the twice born. In the western world you see such beautiful things, such development but if we do not find out the roots of this tree we will be in truouble. And these roots are within ourselves. We have to become subtler personalities to enter into those roots to nourish ourselves. I have told already; they have told you about the subtle energy that is within us. Which is in the triangular bone called sacrum. That means this triangular bone was known to the Greeks as something very sacred that they called it as Sacrum. So this residual energy is placed in this triangular bone is the energy of our pure desire. Our pure desire is something once this achieved, we don’t desire anything anymore. And you know in economics they said that in general ‘wants are not satiable’. So, this energy which is of our pure desire has to work it out in such a way that we get our second birth giving us self-realization, the self-knowledge. When this Kundalini raises, when this energy raises it passes through six centers the sixth been in the limbic area and crosses through this fontanelle bone area which it was a soft bone in your childhood. So actually, you get the actualization of your baptism. And you can feel in your self the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out. Also, you can feel all around yourself the all-pervading power as cool breeze. All the living work is organized by this power. We take it for granted all this miracle of a flower becoming a fruit and the colors they have according to the family they belong. So as I said this is a living process which has made you from ameba to a human being and now there’s a very little more left is to become a super human being. For that only this residual power has to raise which is light up reviewed in a seed. When you put the seed in the Mother Earth, it sprouts by itself. It does not have to read a book, it does not have to stand on the leg, nothing of that kind. It just works because it’s a built in. Because it is built in you, nothing has to be done about it. It just works. That is what is sahaja. Sahaja means sa means ‘with’ and ja means ‘born’. The one which is born with you. UNCLEAR[] this right. Of yoga means union with the Divine power. You have done enough now to seek the Truth. You have worked very hard already. Now you don’t have to do anything. I tell you, sitting on your chairs you can get your self-realization. Its very simple. I do not know what questions you have because I am sorry for being late because of first the traffic and then the television. If you have any questions please ask me then we can have the experience very fast(ly) because as this as you see now beautiful lights are there and you just have to switch on the switch and it comes out automatically and I don’t have to tell the whole history of this UNCLEAR[] and of the electricity and everything. It’s a headache. Better to have to light. And this is a very mass subject and there are thousand and thousand lectures of mine which you can get later on to enjoy them and to understand but to get realization you need not read all that.

First thing that will happen to you that when Kundalini crosses this center, between the optic chiasma you will be thoughtlessly aware. This will be completely aware, there won’t be any thought troubling you. If you want you can think, if you don’t want you need not think. Then you find the cool breeze out of your head coming out and you can feel it with your hands by yourself. You have to certify yourself. Sometimes you feel the heat also coming out because if there is too much heat in the body then it comes out of first then the cool breeze starts coming out. Also, you start feeling it on your hands very clearly. Then only you have to know what are these centers and what do they mean. And then if you know how to correct your centers your own or others you correct it. Thus, you become a master. So I would like to have some questions from the people of Naples.

Question: She is asking whether this sahaja yoga is similar to the training of technical relaxation?

Shri Mataji: No it is not. You see, training of relaxation is just auto suggestion. They go on tell you relax relax relax relax relax. Actually, you can see with naked eye this energy pulsating like a heart in the triangular bone in some people where there is obstruction. And the doctors can feel with the statoscope the raising of this Kundalini stops till it comes to the top of the head. But in most of the people because it’s a jet age it just goes like a jet. So, it has nothing to do with any such a auto suggestions where you say relax relax relax nothing of that kind, only thing is that you have to accept a situation only to say that we have to enter into the kingdom of God. And that we are not at all guilty of anything. That is the first condition of sahaja yoga. With this you are permanently relaxed. You just swim in the ocean of Joy. There is a hole you see, through which all your worries get out.

Question: Whether the self-realization brings us to the dissociation of the self. Because ...that’s whay he is saying

Shri Mataji: No no no on the contrary, as you said, every human being UNCLEAR[] is the part and parcel of the whole. As they say the macrocosm and the microcosm, microcosm is the small personality, and the macrocosm is the big personality. But you are not aware of that. So, what happens to you is that you become aware of that collective consciousness. You become aware of that. On the contrary you get connected with the whole. When it will happen you know what I am saying. Then there is no body other. You become part and parcel of the whole. That’s UNCLEAR [still happen] sit down. It will. It is going to happen. Yesterday in Sorento so many people, most of them got realizations why can’t it here, they should get it after all.

Question:

Shri Mataji: This finger? That means you are feeling guilty all the time for nothing at all. Is it true? Alright then you don’t feel guilty.

Question: This technique would practically we succeed be in peace with ourselves and with others?

Shri Mataji: Of course. Once you get the peace and others have the peace too. Because they are also realized souls and once you have your peace you don’t lose it like you see if a wheel is moving, the axis is always peaceful. So your attention goes on to the axis and you be the whole wheel, you are not disturbed.

Yes please

Question: Is your relationship with God, UNCLEAR[] church in God?

Shri Mataji: Yes of course. UNCLEAR [I mean you see what you are in church of God.,]

Alright, be comfortable and sit on the chairs. Somebody else get him help to get down. No no no no first sit comfortably. There is a chair be comfortable.

So, what is he saying this gentle man?

What is he saying?

Question: What is your relationship with God?

Shri Mataji: Why? I am not going to tell you anything, you better establish your relationship first of all. See Christ was the Son of God. No doubt. But they crucified Him. When you will know yourself, you will know me. But before that I don’t want to say anything, I don’t want to get crucified. I have to do work.

Question: He said that in the UNCLEAR[] scriptures it is said that the self-realization can be given by only a true master with directly connecting with the UNCLEAR[] from traditions. He says whether you are ...?

Shri Mataji: That you have to judge by yourself. You should not also believing me blindly. You have to keep your mind open like scientists as do. You should treat it as a hypothesis. And if I proved it then as honest people you must accept it.

Question: There is a picture of Christ was there was UNCLEAR[] that will he was teach us something UNCLEAR[] through the picture?

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course crucifixion is not His message though. But he showed through His crucifixion that he was an eternal being because he got resurrected. Now we are UNCLEAR[] in this one in the center behind this red spot as in the brain like the optic chiasma is the crossing point which has got the center called, Agnya. And in this center which is people says UNCLEAR[]. Now in this center resides Christ. He crossed it, through this crucifixion he crossed it for us. Because of that we have such an advantage that when this residual UNCLEAR[] raises and touches this point Christ, he is awaken. When He is awaken within us then the two things that you see here as the ego and super ego the conditioning and our karmas all these sucked in. And once it is sucked in this thing opens up and the Kundalini can come out. This is UNCLEAR[] such a dynamic role because of this crucifixion we have been ever achieved this if we had not gone through this passage, we could not have felt. So, His message is of resurrection. Alright? that as he got resurrected, we resurrected too.

Question: Which is the right womb that we should be get this .,?

Shri Mataji: You should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself because you are going to enter into the kingdom of God. Because you are a human being, and a human being is at epitome of evolution. And He has only the right to enter into the kingdom of God. So, you have to forgive yourself. And you have to think you have respect and love for yourself at this moment.

Question: The question is whether this experience happen in somebody without provoke / without knowing anything why you speaking, why you in the UNCLEAR[] and then you realize something at the end.

Shri Mataji: Very rarely UNCLEAR[], very rarely. One has to be UNCLEAR[] high quality?

Question: He is not feeling heat, isn’t it a concept UNCLEAR[] eastern tradition.

Shri Mataji: UNCLEAR[] that way, BUT you see when we feel guilty about something we should face it. We should talk with guilty because guilty means we are running away from Truth. If you have done something wrong just decide ‘I will not do it next time’ finished. See if you tell go on the wrong things then you start feeling guilty. But that doesn’t stop them doing wrong things. But if you can face and see that it was wrong next time you can’t just do it. Feeling guilty is something like it taking all the mistakes and putting them into a safe lock you see. Because whatever has done, its done. I mean its gone. Its past. We have to be in the present.

Question: God is everything. How can these things exist: mistake, sin, guilt?

Shri Mataji: Because you see, we are human beings we are not God. After self-realization you become righteous. You don’t do wrong things. Then you really become Godly. Because of darkness we do sins. And because we do not see in darkness we do wrong things.

Yogi: He wants to have the experience.

Shri Mataji: So, let us have the experience now, we will be waiting for the experience. Let’s have the experience, these questions are taking too long. But one thing I must tell you questions are not going to give you the answer of self-realization. There is no guarantee, it has to work out. One can’t just guarantee it. Like Christ has said that some seeds fell on the rock and some fell in the fertile land. In the same way we can’t guarantee it. But still I am surprised that in Italy it works out very fast. Italian people there is something special about them. They are chosen people by God, and I think that it works so fast. So may God bless you all.

UNCLEAR[]

Question: He is saying once Kundalini is awaken how long it stays after you start?

Shri Mataji: It stays there. For some people it stays permanently. But for some people see if you have problems in your UNCLEAR[], problem some where it goes back. It means that it again raises. That’s why we have courses. Now we have courses here which are absolutely free, you can’t pay for it. No body has to pay single pie for it. Just absolutely free. Because it’s a living process. And in the courses you will know how to fix it up permanently and how to work it on others also. And with these courses you will also become such a master that you can give realization to others. You can cure others. Look at Anthony he is so young, and he is so knowledgeable. And he had never heard the name of Kundalini before he came to sahaja yoga.

Question: Who told you all these things?

Shri Mataji: Now, when you get your realization, you will know how I know these things I am doing. And all these things are there will be from since long. I know them. UNCLEAR[]

There must be something about me. Otherwise, how will I know all these things? Who told Christ? So let us wait and see. Gradually you will know everything about me. First you have to be aware of yourself. You have to be realized souls then you will know many things. Alright.

So, now very simple things we have to do is just you take out your shoes and put both the feet on the ground. And those who are sitting on the ground don’t have to worry but you have to take out your shoes. Because shoes are little bit keeps you away from Mother Earth. First of all, UNCLEAR[]. Now you have to sit in a comfortable manner with both the legs apart from each other. Be comfortable.

I think if you sit on a chair will be better for you {Shri Mataji addressing a seeker}

Madam, ya for you I am saying. Sit like that, there’s a chair. There’s a chair there’s a chair. Please come.

So now, its very simple put your both the legs apart from each other UNCLEAR[]. And we have to use left-hand to express our desire to get self-realization. You put the left-hand like this the way he is showing towards me. All of you have to do it. Alright? Then you have to use the right hand for releasing our centers. Because I want you to know how to use it later on also. So, then you have to understand that first, I will show you then you will have to close your eyes and you have to yourself feel it. I am not going to certify. You have to feel it yourself. To begin with, not to feel guilty at all. Again, and again I am saying don’t feel guilty. That’s very important. You should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

Alright. Now, first thing you put your right-hand on your heart where resides your Spirit. Then you put this hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side. We are working only on the left-hand side. Then you have to put our right-hand in the lower part of your abdomen. We are working on the left-hand side. He is showing you. {Shri Mataji addressing to the yogi who is standing beside Her-Take out your coats so that they see you better}. So, in the lower part of your abdomen is the center which works out the Divine laws. So, this is the law, this is the center of pure knowledge. Now, again we take our hand in the upper part of the abdomen. This is the center of your mastery. Then we again go to our heart. Then we take our hand in the corner of our neck and our shoulder like this from the front side and turn your head to your right. This is the center you block when you are guilty. With this blocking of the center, you get Anjaina that’s Spondylitis, many diseases. So, now you take your right-hand and put it on your forehead across and press it on both the sides. And as I said this is the center of Christ. You have to forgive. Now this right-hand you keep it on the back side of your head. Put your head on tact, rest your head like this. So, this is the other side of the same center which is for asking of forgiveness without feeling guilty. Now stretch your hand, bend your head, the center of your palm you have to put it on the soft bone of your fontanelle bone area. Which was in your childhood was a soft bone. Now push back your fingers, bend your head and try to move your scalp with pressure seven times.

That’s all you have to do.

But now close your eyes. Before that take out your spectacles also. Because it helps you your eyesight. Now, we will be closing our eyes sitting comfortably, two legs apart from each other, and sitting straight without any strain. And not bending backwards forwards but in a straight line without any strain on the body. Now you could put the left-hand toward me and please close your eyes all of you. Now, please put your right-hand on your heart. This is the center of your Spirit. Here you have been asking a question, a very fundamental question three times. You can call me Shri Mataji or Mother. Please say ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’ ask this question three times in your heart. Please don’t open your eyes. Now, if you are the Spirit, you are also your master. So please put your right-hand in the upper part of your abdomen in the left-hand side. Now here you have to ask another question three times ‘Mother, am I my own master?’ ask this question three times. Now you have to put your right-hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here you have to ask in your own freedom for the pure knowledge. I cannot force on you. So please ask six times ‘Mother, may I have the pure knowledge? Mother, please give me pure knowledge’. When you ask for the pure knowledge then the Kundalini starts raising. So, now we have to open the upper centers with full confidence. Please take your right-hand now in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here you have to say with full confidence ten times ‘Mother, I am my own master’. Say it ten times please. Now the most important thing is that you are the self, you are the Spirit. You are not this body, mind, ego or your conditionings. You are the self. This is the greatest Truth about you that you are the Spirit. So, please put your right-hand on your heart and with full confidence please say twelve times ‘Mother, I am the Spirit’. Now, please put your hand between your neck and your shoulder that you should know that the Divine love is the ocean of blessings and joy. But above all it is the power of forgiveness. So, please turn your head towards right and say sixteen times with full confidence ‘Mother, I am not guilty at all’. If you still feel guilty you can say to punish yourself hundred and eight times if you want to still feel guilty. Because I tell you, you are not guilty. Now please put your hand on your forehead across and press it with both the hands. Here you have to say, ‘Mother, I forgive everyone’ from your heart. How many times is not the problem. Many people think that its very difficult to forgive. But those who forgive or don’t forgive is a myth. So, by not forgiving you play into the hands of wrong people. So just forgive. Now, take your hand on the back side of your head and put your head it, rest on it. Now, here you have to say from your heart, ‘O Divine, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes’ but please do not feel guilty, do not count your mistakes. Just say for your satisfaction. Now stretch your hand please and put the center of your palm on to the fontanelle bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood and bend your head. Press back your fingers and press your palm. Now again I cannot take your freedom. So, in your own freedom you have to ask for self-realization. So, seven times you say ‘Mother, please give me self-realization’ and also now press your scalp and move it strongly seven times by saying that. Push back your fingers press it hard.

Now please take down your hands. Open your eyes slowly. Now watch me without thinking. Put your hands like this. Now put the right-hand towards me, bend your head and place your left-hand on top of the fontanelle bone and see if there is a cool breeze coming in. Now, put your left-hand towards me. Now bend your head and put your right-hand on the top of the head. Now, see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze. Now last UNCLEAR [time, step] you put your right-hand towards me and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze out of your head. Bend your head. Now put both your hands towards the sky and bend back your head. And ask a question three times ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother is this the Divine love of God? Mother is this the all-pervading subtle life?’

Now take down the hands. Now watch me without thinking.

Those who have felt the cool breeze out of their head or out of their hands please raise both the hands. Napoles is great, all have got realization so many. So, we can’t get I know. But can’t you worry. Everybody is going to feel it. Again, get a sap to see how many got it. All of you May God bless you. Now in any case, those who haven’t got can come this side, they will work it out on them. Those who haven’t got can come this side. There is a group of people didn’t get realized.
