Qawwals before weddings, Ganpatipule (India), December 29, 1994

[At 49:03 on audio]Babamama: Before we conclude this beautiful ‘get together’ with the joy that we have had for so many days, I think Shri Mataji wants to speak to you.May I request, I call him Sir C.P., doctor Shrivastava, to kindly say a few words.Sir C.P.: After this beautiful poetry, it’s difficult to say anything because my heart is also full, I’m sure, as yours is. But since I’ve been instructed to say a few words, I will. First of all, this cannot be a part of the earth that I have been living in, it must be a part of heaven which I am seeing here.[Applause]
