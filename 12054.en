Greetings to all seekers of truth! First of all, it is very unfortunate that we arrived so late, and the airplane was delayed for so long, and you all have been sitting here with such eagerness and patience. And from there, a helpless mother was wondering how to reach here. Seeing all of you, it feels like the days of changing the world have indeed arrived. Your eagerness is very evident. And your desire is that we attain the truth. One thing to say about the truth is that the truth is as it is. If we wish to change it, we cannot change it. And if we want to form a notion with our intellect or mind and call it truth, then it cannot be the truth. So, what is the truth? The truth is that we are all souls. We are ‘Atma swaroop’.

Everything is so beautifully decorated here, and so many lamps have been lit, that are illuminating. Which is enabling us to see and know each other? But if there is the darkness of ignorance here, if we are lost in that ignorance, then one thing should be known: we can all be enlightened, and a lamp can be lit within us as well. And we can very easily ignite this lamp, light it, and spread its illumination throughout the world. So far, much effort has been made in the name of God. We have been exploited in the name of faith in God. This is not the case in any other country, but in our country, no matter how many calamities come, no matter how much suffering we endure, we continue to believe that one day, God will surely show us the way, and we keep looking forward to that golden day when we will attain our salvation. We only need to be liberated from our ignorance. And this ignorance has settled within us in many different forms.

For example, something told to us since childhood, something we hear from others, or the customs of the house we are born into become significant to us. And these customs, taking different forms everywhere, become so peculiar that our children ask, “What is the benefit of doing all this? You do so many things, but there has been no change in you.” A person, whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, of any caste, or any religion, can commit all kinds of sins. They can commit every type of crime. If we say that we are religious and have religion within us, then how can we commit sins? But we see that the great saints and sages, of whom we have so many examples before us, never do wrong deeds and never bow before wrongdoers.

You know about the revered Nizamuddin Sahib here. The Shah had said, 'If you do not bow before me, I will behead you.' He did not bow and said, 'I bow only before the one God.' After that, you know that it was the Shah who was beheaded." So, what was the significance of such sages and saints who spoke with such courage and wisdom? What was so special about them that made them so different from us? They were in a state where nothing seemed to affect them that would deter them from embracing the truth. They stood firmly and unwaveringly in their beliefs. Because their beliefs were not blind. They knew with conviction that this was the truth, and today, as we seek our soul, in its light, we will come to know that the truth can only be understood in the light of the soul.

Every religion, every religion in the world, if you understand a little, you will realize that in essence, every religion is the same. And every religion teaches the same thing: that we should let go of the transient things and embrace the eternal, the infinite things. Many times, we get so entangled in worldly matters that we forget that transient things are fine as long as they are within limits, but excessive indulgence in them leads to our destruction. They themselves are perishable, and ultimately, we are also destroyed by them. However, to understand all this, we need to have knowledge. Knowledge does not mean just reading and writing. Many people tell me that they read the 'Shivlilamrut' daily and recite a chapter from it every day. "But has there been any change within you because of it? Can you say that after reading the Shivlilamrut, you will not commit any sins? Or can you say the same after reading the Quran, that we will not commit any sins after this? Can you say after reading the Granth Sahib that we will not commit any sins? So, what are written in these great books have become mere words? It is within us.

Whatever exists is external, and if we think that just by reading them we will be fine, then that's our misconception. We should only understand, be aware of it. That means we should know ourselves in our veins. This divine power is spread all around. It is said that there's no harm in seeing! If you are a person of science, then observe it, what is this power that you can attain?" "The power that exists within us, the power that we are aware of, if we say that it is dormant within us, then is there any harm in us fully obtaining it? Because if this is our own power and we are meant to be aware of it, and we are the ones who are supposed to raise high with it, then why not fully embrace this thing and thoroughly understand what it is?" Doctor Sahib says that You were already told that there is a power named Kundalini within us. We have chakras within us, and when Kundalini awakens, our Brahmarandhra, the upper part of the palate, opens up, and cool breeze starts flowing through it, and cool breeze also starts flowing all around.

But what is the evidence for this? This cool breeze, this is the very thing that is called Param Chaitanya. "One day, there was a lecture of ours. Those people came and said, 'We don't believe you because you are not a Brahmin. We won't give you anything.' Everyone said, 'All right, we have written it down on paper. If you don't believe, that's fine, we will cancel it, but we will mention your name that you refused like this.' They started saying, 'No, it's not like that. ‘Okay, the program is happening there." Now they didn't tell me anything further. Unsure of how to proceed, I said, "Those who claim to understand Brahman, let them come forward." So, eight to ten people came and stood there. I said, "Please sit down." After they sat down, I said, "put your hands before me." Their hands were trembling. So, I said, "Look, your hands are shaking." They started saying, "Bhai! please stop, stop. Mother, we accept that you have power. That's why our hands are trembling." I said, "That's not it. Others' hands are not trembling." They said, "Look at how these people's hands is trembling!" I said, "Go and ask them, who are these people?" So, they explained, "We are from the mental asylum in Thane. Because one patient in Thane got cured, the doctor brought us here. We are certified lunatics." Then it struck them that the hands of these certified lunatics were trembling just like theirs. So, there must be something to it. Then they asked, "Mother, what is this thing?" I said, "Son, this is the supreme consciousness. It's shaking you and shaking them too. But you should attain it. When you know Brahman, only then consider yourself reborn. It means you have been born again." They had falsely labelled themselves. You are nothing. There is no evidence from that.

But for a true saint, a genuine guru, what need is there for evidence? In Sanskrit, it is said that if musk exists somewhere, there is no need to swear an oath to prove that it is musk. Its fragrance itself reminds you that it is musk. Similarly, the powers within you, until they manifest, until their light spreads, will you believe it just by saying it? "Or will anyone believe that you are a great soul or a very religious person? Or that you are such a being with so much virtue from past good deeds? Labelling yourself in this way does not make you virtuous. Another thing that is often said is that a person becomes pure by performing karma. I said, "What karma does a person actually perform?" As long as you have the feeling that you are doing the karma, you are not truly genuine. The ego within you is growing, and that ego is telling you that you are doing this karma, you are doing that karma.

But what are we really doing? Something died. A tree died, and we turned it into furniture, or some stones were brought and turned into buildings. So what significant work have you done? You have done work with dead things. Have you done any living work? After Sahaja Yoga, when you transcend, the Kundalini rises from your hands. There was a very great, very famous saint. He said to me, "Mother, why are you giving liberation to all these people? Why are you giving them so much power?" I said, "Sir, don't ask me why we are giving it. But we certainly are giving it. And think about it, yes, it is our will. We can give it to whoever we want. Who are you to force us?" They said, "We worked so hard. We did so much." I asked, "Why did you work hard? Did I tell you to?" There is no need to work hard. If you are working hard, then why say things like, 'We worked hard. I did this. I observed so many fasts.” "Then I took sannyasa. I left my wife and children." Did I tell you to do that? Why did you do it? Even if you didn't do all those things, you would still attain Self-realization.

The point is we can't do anything. This is a living process. It happens by itself. It is the birthright of every human being to attain this yoga. Why did God make you a human? Just to leave you incomplete like that? To plunge into this ignorance? It can't be like that. God, who is supremely compassionate and merciful, would not leave you like this. Many people think that the whole world is about to be destroyed. But the one who created this world is so powerful and capable. Would He let the world be destroyed? Never. And therefore, know that among you, strong individuals will emerge who can change the entire world and bring joy to the whole world. It's very late today, and I can't give a long speech, but I have planned to come back to Noida on the 16th. Then, I will explain everything to you properly. But don't spend so much money. I feel that you have spent so much and made such elaborate arrangements. I don't know how you are bearing such expenses! There is no need to spend so much. How much expense for a mother, no need! You guys can arrange things in a simple way and don't spend so much.

I will come back here on the 16th. It's already very late. You all have been waiting for so long. Although I wanted you to ask me questions, and I would answer them. But it might be that you ask questions, and on the 16th, I answer all your questions. Another thing is, just as you have installed so many lights here. Ask how to light these lights, they will say, just turn it on, and they will come on. Similarly, there has been a complete arrangement within you as well.

Even Noida residents live with God. They have made a beautiful arrangement within you. Organized. And just by flipping a switch, everything will be done. Now if someone from Noida tells you that electricity comes from here. Bring it from here. Bring that from here. What is the history of this electricity? Then sir, it will be a headache. You will say, Bhai!, first turn on the light, then we will talk. That's the thing. In Sahaj Yoga, first you attain your enlightenment and then we will talk again. So it's possible that today, right now, we use it. And then afterwards, you come on the 16th. So explain it in detail. And for those who won't experience today, they must certainly come on the 16th.

So once again, I want to express my sadness that I came so late, but it also means that those who truly desire the Divine with consistency, they are sitting here right now. Otherwise, our time would be spent wandering here and there. But they also said that the Ramayana will conclude at nine o'clock, only then will people come. Then I said, those who want to watch the Ramayana, let them watch the Ramayana, and those who want to know themselves, let them come" And it happened that you came in such large numbers. And it was a great joy to see that so many people are searching for truth and seeking the Divine. Infinite blessings to all of you!

It will take at most ten to fifteen minutes more. When you have shown so much patience, then sit comfortably for another ten to fifteen minutes. It's very simple, straightforward. There's no need to work hard. No need to stand with force. Today, this much is explained, and on the sixteenth date, I will tell you more things. But left-hand, turn towards me. I will say left and right, because in Hindi, one says one way, in Punjabi they say the other way and in Marathi they the third way, so let's stick to English, left and right.

So, put your left hand before me. Because this hand indicates that you desire Self-realization. It's symbolizing your willpower. Therefore, your desire is to attain Self-realization. And the other right hand is your power of action. With this power, you can touch different chakras. We also help them to regulate the flow of Kundalini. That's why we're doing this. There may not be a need for you all, but we're doing this so that you also become a little more spiritual.

So first, the left hand will face towards us, everyone, and the right hand will be placed on your heart. This heart the is abode of our soul. The soul, which is a reflection of the Supreme Being, and the Kundalini, which is considered the divine Power, is a reflection of the willpower of the Supreme Being. And their union is indeed Sahaja Yoga. And just as you can sprout a seed by planting it in the ground, within the womb of this Mother Earth, similarly, you can awaken it. Likewise, this Kundalini is also awakened in the form of a living process.

There is no difficulty in it. There is no trouble. For this, you cannot give money. Tell me, when you do farming, how much money do you give to this earth? Does it understand currency, money? Or does the seed understand that it should take so much money for sprouting? Nothing. Similarly, both of these are beyond the realm of intellect, in living processes.

I will tell you to place your hand on your heart first, and then, we will be doing all work by right hand, to place your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen. This is our Guru principle. The Guru principle within us means, the work done by great Gurus, that by awakening of this chakra which is specially made, we recognize our Guru. Because when enlightened, we become our own Guru. And all this is made possible by the grace of all the Sadgurus.

This chakra is of pure desire or pure knowledge. Pure desire is the power of Kundalini. This desire is such that it is pure. It means that other desires even though satisfied, yet the desire does not end. One leads to another, from second to third, but for no solution. Afterwards, keep your right hand in the lower part of the abdomen, press the left hand side.

Pure desire! What is pure desire? It's to attain unity with the Supreme Being. Through it, yoga happens. Attain this yoga from the power that is spread all around. This is your pure desire, which is in the dormant state. You might not even know about it. Maybe, I should first build a house, then buy a car, then do this, does that, but these are not pure desires. Because one leads to another. But the real desire inside you, which you may not even know about, is only one: to attain unity with the omnipresent Supreme Consciousness. This is the true, pure desire. And upon attaining it, you become completely pure. And this is exactly what the Gurus have said, that you become pure. Become pure.

With the power of this desire, we awaken the Kundalini, and through its auspicious influence, the power is awakened in every nerve of our body, and through it, we know pure knowledge, not impure knowledge. Impure knowledge means doing magic, hypnotizing someone, mesmerizing them, and so on; these are impure knowledge. Because in it, people use very filthy things like witchcraft, sorcery, necromancy, and so on. But when you receive pure knowledge, it settles into every nerve of your body, you know.

You can understand in your fingers and in the six and seven chakras which are your mental descendants that you have the power of desire in your mind, which chakra is holding, and from your right hand also you can know what your physical and mental problems are. Similarly, there are also seven chakras here, seven here as well. You can know from your fingers what trouble you have.

Prophet Muhammad has said that when the Qiyamah comes, when the time of Resurrection comes, when the time of reckoning comes, then your hands will speak, and you will bear witness that very night. We are not saying anything new. We are talking about the time of Resurrection. That time has come. Now, at this moment, whatever they desire, they can also know that supreme truth and attain complete union with it.

First, unity leads to being its witness. Until our relationship is not with it, we are completely useless. Just as if this (microphone) is not connected, it's useless. What happens after that? I will fully explain that on the sixteenth date. But in India, you all know that the saints and sages attain union with the divine. For them, leaving the household, practising asceticism, facing worldly troubles, or taking renunciation wearing monastic robes, these are not necessary for everyone. This is all about inner state. We have to attain this.

So, this is your pure knowledge, and you will have to accept pure knowledge. I won't force it upon you. Then move this hand upwards. The hand we place on the upper part of the stomach in our left-hand side, where the Guru principle is. Then place this hand on the heart. Then bend this hand between the neck and shoulder, towards the angle on its back. And turn to the right side.

Please everyone sit down. It is very beneficial on the ground. Please everyone sit down. Sit down. It's a matter of five minutes. Sit comfortably. Now place your hand on the neck and turn your neck this way.

Those wearing shoes, those sitting on chairs, should take off their shoes, it will be good. There are a lot of benefits from the earth element. Those sitting on the ground should also take off their shoes. Turn your neck this way. Now when this chakra catches, when a person thinks, 'I have committed this sin, I have committed that sin.' Finally, thinking like this is not having a good effect. As a result, a person grips this chakra and faces many troubles, several diseases occur. So, no one should think at this time that 'I am bad, I am very sinful.' Absolutely, such thoughts should not be entertained. After all, you are not a God. You are a human.

Now place this hand flat on your forehead and press it, on the forehead. Forehead means not the head, forehead means this, the frontal part. This is called the forehead. Press it as if you have a headache. Now, take this, your hand, backward and place it on your head and look upward. Now it's the Agnya chakra. The front part of the Agnya chakra is for forgiveness, and the rear part is for seeking forgiveness.

Now stretch your hand. After this, we will do it. Now, I'm showing what to do. Stretch this hand and turn these fingers backward, placing the heel of your hand on the back, and bend your head like this. Slowly rotate it like the hands of a clock. That's all you need to do.

Now, everyone close your eyes. Remove your glasses too because you don't need to open your eyes. Therefore, everyone remove your glasses and sit comfortably. If you have shoes or anything on your feet, take them off.

Now, first of all, it needs to be done that you should be pleased with yourself. You should forgive yourself in this way. "I made this mistake, I made that mistake." Chase away thoughts of remorse from your mind in this way. Such mistakes keep happening. If you don't make such mistakes, then how are you human! Don't blame yourself for it. Sit with a cheerful mind.

Now, everyone close your eyes, and the left hand towards us and the right hand placed on the heart. Placing the left hand on the heart, just like you ask a question to the computer, ask me a very important question, and that question is, "Shri Mataji, am I the soul?" Ask this question three times. "Shri Mataji, am I the soul?" Everyone, close your eyes, place your hand on your heart with complete tranquillity, and turn your left hand towards me, and please ask, "Shri Mataji, am I the soul?" Ask this three times. You don't need to move your neck, you don't need to move your body. Ask calmly.

Now, when you become the soul, you also say 'yes' to your guru. Because in the light of the soul, we can guide ourselves. Place your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen and turn your left hand towards me and press it. And here, pressing your stomach, ask another question to the left-hand side, "Shri Mataji, am I my own guru?" Ask this question three times. Now place your right hand on the lower part of your stomach.

I have already told you that I cannot force pure knowledge upon you. What is called understanding cannot be loaded. Therefore, you have to say, "Shri Mataji, please give me pure knowledge." Say this six times. "Shri Mataji, please give me pure knowledge." At this time, do not think about others. At this time, we need to look at ourselves, not others. Say this six times. Because this chakra has six petals. So please say it six times.

As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini begins to stir. And the Kundalini started to rise upwards. Therefore, we need to assist it in the upper chakras so that it can easily ascend upwards.

So, place the right hand on the upper part of the abdomen, and with the left hand, press the left side. Here, you need to say with complete self-confidence, to open this chakra, "Shri Mataji, I am my own guru." And because there are ten principles, say it ten times. "Shri Mataji, I am my own guru," with complete self-confidence.

Keep this right hand on your heart. But remember, this is the most important chakra and question, and you have to answer it. With full self-confidence, keep it on your heart and say, with complete self-confidence, "Shri Mataji, I am the Atma." Say it twelve times, "Shri Mataji, I am the Spirit." As I mentioned before, be pleased with yourself. Because the Param Chaitanya is an ocean of peace, compassion, and joy. But above all, it is powerful in forgiveness. Therefore, no matter what mistakes you have made, this powerful force of forgiveness can completely destroy all your faults within itself. So, remain cheerful and content with yourself.

Place your right hand on the angle between your neck and shoulder from the front, and turn your neck to the right side. Say sixteen times, with complete confidence, "Shri Mataji, I am not guilty." Say it sixteen times with full confidence, "Shri Mataji, I am not guilty." This is the chakra that most people have trouble with. I don't know why you have been taught to always blame yourself. Whatever you are, let the Kundalini, your own personal mother, know it. Why do you judge yourself? Why do you accept your mistakes? Let her know. She knows everything about you. Let her decide.

Now, press your right hand against both sides of your forehead. Here, you need to say, "Shri Mataji, I have forgiven everyone." Many people say that it's very difficult to forgive. But I want to tell you that whether you forgive or not, both are illusions. However, if you do not forgive, you play into the hands of others. Therefore, forgive everyone. Please forgive everyone from your heart. After this, there are no more questions. Just say it wholeheartedly. There’s no need to list names or remember what anyone did, simply say, "Shri Mataji, I have forgiven everyone together with all my heart."

Now, place your hand on the back of your head. And rest your head completely on it. After this, for your own peace, say about yourself, "Oh Divine Consciousness, if I have made any mistakes, please forgives me." But at this moment, don't sit counting your mistakes. Please, without blaming yourself, say with a pure heart, "Whatever mistakes I may have made, please forgive me."

Now, hold it completely and stretch it to place the other part on your crown, but make sure to bow your head. By bowing your head, place properly the palm of your hand on your crown and rotate it. Rotate it seven times slowly, like the hands of a clock. But again, the same point is that I cannot impose Self-realization on you. I cannot force it upon you. I respect your freedom. Therefore, in your freedom, please say seven times, "Shri Mataji, please give me Self-realization." Say this seven times while rotating your crown. Bow your head and rotate seven times.

Now I will blow the Pranava. So, bow your head and the work will be done. (Mataji is blowing into the microphone)

Now lower your hands. Slowly open your eyes. Now extend both hands towards me. Now extend your right hand towards me like this. Right hand. And with your head bowed, check with your left hand if cool air is coming from the crown of your head where it used to be soft in your childhood. And if it feels warm, there is no harm. See if it is warm or cool. The air should be coming from your own crown. You have to know yourself. It won't happen just because I say so.

Now extend your left hand towards me. Now bow your head and check again. You should keep your hand above. Do not press it against the head, keep it slightly above. See if cool air is coming or not. Turn your right hand towards me and bow your head to see if cool air is coming or not. Some people feel it very strongly.

Now, with both hands facing upwards towards the sky, move your neck backwards and ask a question, "Shri Mataji, is this the supreme consciousness?" "Shri Mataji, is this the love of the Supreme Being?" Ask me this question three times, please. Now, lower your hands. Turn both hands towards me. Slowly open your eyes. Now become thoughtless. You will feel a sudden peace and it will seem like you have completely relaxed.

Now, in some people, air can also come from below. They should sit with their hands raised like this. If someone feels energy in the right hand and not in the left, then everyone should turn their left hand towards me and their right hand towards the ground. If the energy is coming in the right hand, then they should turn their left hand towards me and place their right hand on the ground.

If some people feel the energy in their head but not in their hands, then they should say, "Shri Mataji, you might be those who have a Kuldevi (family deity)". Some might believe in them. They should come into our heads. Similarly, some may ask, 'Shri Mataji, are you the family deity?' You may believe in a guru, you may believe in Nanak Sahib, who is the true Sadguru. Ask, 'Shri Mataji, are you Nanak Sahib?'

If you believe in Mahavir, ask for Mahavir, for Dattatreya, ask for Dattatreya. We have no bias. You ask us three times. Now, those who feel the energy in their left hand but not in their right hand, they should turn their right hand towards me.

Those in whom the energy flows in the left hand but not in the right hand, they should turn their right hand towards me. Those who don't feel it should turn towards me. And the left hand, which has the energy, should be directed upwards. Like this. Behind. It's like wearing a shield. Because it's like the mother's embrace.

Turn your left hand towards me. So, once you're past, after the awakening of Kundalini, no such power can trouble you. So, before going to bed every night and before going outside in the morning, you can do this. So, turn your left hand towards me. And slowly lift the right hand and bring it here. One, then bring it back, two, then bring it back, three, and then four. This is a shield. Four, then five, then six, and seven. Doing it seven times completes, three and a half full circles. Look at the three and a half coils of Kundalini.

Now, how to raise the Kundalini? Now, sitting down, turn the left hand towards me like this. Left hand, like this. Its showing. The Kundalini is triangular-shaped in the sacrum. Keep it like this and place the right hand over it. Like this. Wrapping it. Keep the left hand straight, and move the right hand wrapping. Wrapping it around, slightly lift the neck and tie a knot. This is the knot of Kundalini. Then the other hand. Place it on the left hand like this, and wrap the right hand over it. Lift it again for the second time. As you lift, take the neck back and tie it for the second time. Now, tie three knots for the third time. While keeping the hands like this, keep moving. Keep them equal, and then take the neck back, and then one knot, then another side, and then another side. You've tied it.

Now, turn your hands towards me. Now, all those who have felt coolness in their hands or coolness in their head, raise both hands.

Greetings to all of you! What is this Noida, I don't know. By the banks of the Yamuna, you all have crossed over. There's no need to mess up after this. Stay peaceful. Because it's said, "What else to say in ecstasy." So, stay in bliss. Enjoy yourselves. And we would like to relax a bit.

We have also come to India after a long time. If you permit, we also want to listen to some music. You all sit peacefully. And don't think. Don't talk among yourselves, don't think. Even if nothing happens to anyone, there's nothing to worry about.
