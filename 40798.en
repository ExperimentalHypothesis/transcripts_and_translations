Award to Shri Mataji from Prof. Voronov. St. Petersburg, Russia 15-09-1994

I would say that after seeing what they have done in India, no one can believe that Koran can do any good to them. They are the poorest people in India, the poorest.

When I see them, I really feel like crying, because one man has produced 20 children, 24 children, one man. And they are left on the street because talap talap talap finished.

This is never Mohammed Saab.

If you understand divinity you understand.

Can I do such a thing? Will I permit such a thing? Will I allow such a thing? Then you judge him by me. So, no use criticizing Mohammed Saab because he was divine, he was divinity, no doubt about it, but the people who followed them are really mad.

Like the Christians who followed Christ are mad. If you are to judge Christ, judge Him from me. Will My Mother do that? Will She do this? She will never do.

So, if you start judging them by my standard, you will understand that none of them were wrong, none of them were against Divine laws.

They were all together. They came to change the world to help me in such a big way. Without them, I would not have been as successful as I am.

1:34

Because they have definitely created CHAKRAS within in a way subtle.

And their chakras were worked out.

So, don’t judge Muslims, Christians, Hindus, or Shiks, the way they follow their religion, but the way the people who created them lived.

1:52

So, for you, an example is here. I can’t do many things which are described. Impossible.

He had to marry alright, five wives, four wives, alright. Because that was the time when there were very few women, very few, and many men died. I would say very few men who could marry. So, the women didn’t know what to do. He married even...he said ‘you marry even younger (young girl) doesn’t matter but marry them.

He was for marriages. He wanted that there should be marriages and that women should not become prostitutes.

Now, what the Muslims grudge is that Christians are immoral.

They are no malice; I can tell you. There’s no malice.

2:53

I've seen them.

I was travelling from Riyadh to London and I went off to sleep.

When I got up, I was surprised to see that they were all different people. I couldn’t understand this, from where they have appeared. They were all wearing these, ah. thing on their head, you see, what they call is the Italian ....cloth. And suddenly, they became very great, you see...

Bodha, this, that...

smoking, and drinking. And women also drink.

3:22

So, I thought must have been some other place ...maybe Paris we might have been. So, the air hostess said, ‘no no they are the same people.’

I said, ‘they were the same’, ... ‘yes absolutely the same... We never touch any other port’.

This kind of hypocrisy cannot be any religion.

In Sahaja Yoga, one thing, you cannot be hypocritical. If you are there you'll be corrected, corrected, corrected till you are alright. You cannot carry on with your chakras all kinds of defects they have and they start emitting bad vibrations and spoil the Viswa Nirmala Dharma., means the innate pure religion we have.

If you follow a religion, you have to be a perfect member of that. You cannot be a hypocrite, that’s the point.

In Sahaja Yoga, anybody who thinks that he can be (not clear) ... I will know who they are. Till we live, you will know who they are.

So, it’s a new race we are starting.

It's a race of realized souls, who know what is right and wrong and will go out of the way to keep the right path alright.

So, the responsibility is much. As we said we have light, we are enlightened, now keep the lights on.

4:51

You must know that you have a very big responsibility, a very big responsibility to keep this path of true, pure religion enlightened for others also.

5:07

If you say something, and do something, then we are not religious at all. That's hypocrisy.

5:12

So please try to understand, so many Sahaja Yogis we had to ask them to go away because you know they had funny problems... Agnya, sometimes this, sometimes that. They had to go away but still, there is forgiveness in Sahaja Yoga. There's redemption in Sahaja Yoga. There are love and compassion and it works.

The only difference is that there is no punishment, no physical punishment, no mental punishment. We just say ‘alright, you cannot fit here, so go away’. Instead of having any punishment.

If there is any difference between other religions and this religion is this. That there is no punishment for whatever you may do to me or to anyone.

Christ might punish, I don't know. Deities might punish, that's different. But as far as I am concerned, I am not going to punish, it’s alright...Thank you very much, you can go away.

And that becomes the greatest punishment now for people.

So, you have to keep your health alright, wealth alright, your temperament alright. Everything should be pleasant and joyous. That's all.

6:33

Automatically it can be. How we enjoy today thoroughly and how the beautiful singing, dancing, everything is so nice, so good. There was nothing that was ugly or funny.

6:51

Even modern dancing and modern music were so beautiful, you know. It was so beautiful. ahh, that; normally I got a headache from that but nothing, my headache was gone, is so good. So, if it is done with that purity, that understanding, creativity takes every form in a beautiful way, as many flowers. Every flower is a beauty. I would request you all to remember that you cannot be hypocritical. Hypocrisy is not going to help. Don't support any hypocrite, in no way. That's all.

7:24

You don't have to punish, not have to say any word, nothing. It is not my job to punish them. There are so many who can punish them, so why worry.

7:37

I really feel very happy today that we have entered into that area, where I was longing to enter and that is it. And I must also say, (name) Gilmet has done so much research work and we should give her a hand for this.

( applause...)

8:05

Who so ever has written this, I don't know why it was written the whole, (Gilmet) has written.

I could see that as I know her. She positively feels. She married a Muslim, she positively feels, that Muslims can be brought to Sahaja Yoga and can be redeemed. They should be, they are human beings, after all, I feel the same way.

8:26

And this is how we are now going to enter into a new era and you’ll be happy to know that the Tunisia government has invited me, government.

(applause..)

8:44

Also, in Brazil, you'll be happy to know that when I went to Brazil, at the airport of Brasilia, the mayor himself brought the key of Brazil, and give it to me and requesting me "Mother, we give this key to you, please look after Brazilian".

(applause)

9:11

Of course, Russia has done so much honor to me. I was really feeling very shy about it but, they are very sensitive and very wise people.

How to .....that they can see that, this is the greatest serving for the whole world. And the way they are taken up, I'll tell you one day, they'll be regarded as the greatest scientist because they have seen the point, you see.

9:36

So easily, while in other countries I cannot explain these people to really understand what is Sahaja yoga is. So, now it’s for you to manifest it and to think about it with a very great understanding.

9:59

You’ll be surprised, that we came to Turkey because of Kalla. She’s another dynamic lady. Such devotion she had. She said, “Mother you come to Turkey”. I could never have come to Turkey. It’s an unknown place to me in every way. But I always read the life of Kamal Pasha and I have tremendous respect for her.

As soon as she said “Mother can you come to Turkey? I said, I will. Then she’s the one who started all these. And the way she identified herself completely.

Now she has gone to Malaysia and everybody is very happy. We have

many great Sahaja yoginis who have done such great pioneer.

But I must say that Gregoire is the one who started it. Where ever he

was posted, he felt lonely so he wanted to have Sahaja yoga in.... So

we have many people who are pioneer and now they are going to South

Africa to other African countries and I am surprised that they are

daring at things, working it out; like Dulio went to Brazil and Horacio

went to Argentina and Gregoire sister, Marila, she went to very

difficult place, ah Bogota, and she worked it out for that country.

11:22

So like that, we have many who are doing it and I cannot name all of

them today but really it’s stand out for their ability to create.

11:35

Philippe has gone to East Germany, which I suggested to him, he immediately agree. He is working it out there,

And also, we have, somebody in Hong Kong who started, doing very good work.

Everywhere I was surprised that these people went there and worked it out. They did not get contaminated but they didn’t try to assert themselves and that is how Sahaja Yoga spread. But the person who started with Gregoire is Rajesh who is here, who’s a very shy person himself. I don’t know how he told the address, my address to Gregoire, and Gregoire came to me.

12:15

So everything had worked out so beautifully as a small little stream flows and then becomes a big river and meets the ocean of the world. In this way, it has happened. On this day of Diwali, you should really feel very happy and joyous that we have been blessed so much.

That so many of us know the truth, and so many of us are enlightened and a

strong, strong collectivity. Thank you very much.

(Applause)

13:00

Professor (name) is here and he wants to give me some special award from St

Petersburg University. So, I would request you all to be seated, it will take hardly ten minutes for the whole thing. So, before that, I must say the weddings went off very well. Despite the fact in Turkey and it’s very different from India where you can get everything very easily and you all are looking very happy.

13:56

Keep this joy all the time, and be kind and gentle with each other. As

I said you have to soothe others. You have to take up the problems of each other and don’t discuss your past, don’t talk about it. That’s one thing very wrong. That makes life unnecessarily useless. The past is over and now, the reality starts.

Enjoy each other’s company. Try to find good points on another person. If you want to find bad ones, that’s not going to give you any joy, it’s not going to help. But if you start finding the good points of another person, that not only that you will be very happy but also you’ll imbibe those good ones.

14:56

Always try to see each other’s good points. Never criticize each other, for small things, for petty things. We are Sahaj Yogis. You are saints,

you are angels. We cannot be like ordinary stupid people who fight and create problems in their lives. You are here to make each other happy, and to make everyone happy. All the Sahaja yogis to be happy.

15:30

The whole society of Sahaja yoga should be of a very different type. And

there are so many children who have realized souls who are great saints, seers, who want to be born, and they’ll be only born to Sahaja yogis who are

Sahaj by temperament, and who are peaceful, who try to seek peace

everywhere and who are very large-hearted.

16:05

All such people will have very great children.

May God bless you all.

16:18

 (Professor speaking in Russian)

(Speaking in Russian)....

It is a great event that happened on this planet.

(Russian)

This scientist in Russia and (not audible) ...

.......and morality

(Russian)

With regard to this question, there was assort of an agreement, of two directions, and the agreement was of love and friendship. Actually, the directions of

religion and science.

17:58

(Russian)

Morality and knowledge, these are two things that make the whole world think already.

(Russian)

There are wars now on the planet and civil wars. The blood of human

being is shed and during this period, Our Holy Mother raise different

questions of love and peace.

(Russian)

Our scientist, by my initiative unanimously elected Our Holy Mother

Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi an Honorary Member of our Academy.

(applause)

19:27

(Russian)

Last time in Moscow, we hand it over to Our Holy Mother a Diploma made

by Sahaja yogis, loving Sahaja yogis.

But now, this is a Diploma of the government of Russia.

(applause)

20:38

(Russian)

I would like to say a few words about what actually this Academy is and who is a member.

(Russian)

There are members, among the members, we have painters, scientists,

musicians in different directions.

(Russian)

But we also have Honorary members of our Academy but they are very few now.

(Russian)

One is Antonio Juan Samarancha, who is the president of the Olympic committee.

(Russian)

Two or three men states in their own countries liquidated the illiteracy in the population in each country.

All of them are men.

(Russian)

(Applause)

21:00

They only .....

Shri Mataji is the only Lady in the world who has been elected as

Honorary Member of this Academy.

(applause)

(Russian)

22:23

I have to say a lot. I know that here we have the best representatives

of the nations of the world, but there are some exemptions.

(Russian)

22:34

We have to put all our efforts into our self- perfections, recognition,

to put our efforts into the love of our countries.

(Russian)

23:13

We need that, we need to do everything that the victorious ideas of

our Holy Mother should not have any hindrance at all and for that, we should

self-perfect ourselves.

(Russian)

23:29

Yes, we do have something negative besides the positive things.

(Russian)

23:38

For example, me and also our Sahaja yogis from Tokyo, they can see how

the pieces of bread are spread on the floor.

(Russian)

23:52

It’s very bad, I can see it’s very bad.

(Russian)

23:50

My daughter by the name Kithlana is also Sahaja Yogi, she said.

(Russian)

I’ve been living for a long time among the Muslims and I know that

attitude toward bread.

If a piece of bread, fallen on earth, and they picked it up, the kiss it,

they keep and put it somewhere for the birds to pick it up.

(Russian)

24:41

We also have to feel respect for the laborious people who are

producing this bread, the peasants.

(Russian)

24:50

I address all those Sahaja yogis working in press, media, who is a journalist. We need to disseminate the ideas of our Holy Mother everywhere, on press, televisions, and magazines.

(Russian)

25:25

If we do so and we have properly, we can be a real example, we can be

real examples for the nations in the whole world.

(Russian)

25:40

But maybe today the statuesque of Sahaja yoga we were not perhaps quite satisfied with. Still, we have to make it better.

(Russian)

Taking into account the energetic activity of Shri Mataji.

(Russian)

26:17

It gives us an idea to propose to elect Shri MATAJI NIRMALA DEVI Laurette

of the Nobel Prize winner for Peace.

(Big Applause)

(Russian)

27:21

For that purpose, we have to work hard in our own countries, Shri

Mataji’s ideas to be really realized understood and to be on the level of

consciousness.

(Russian)

27:56

To reach that level for the Nobel prize winner; we need to make an example.

We need to make the society, the publicity, press, to realize the ideas

of Shri Mataji, how beneficial that for the whole of humanity.

(Russian)

28:20

In (not clear)......Academia of Arts & Science we have many outstanding people and

perhaps we shall publish a special article for that in Nirmala YOGA

Magazine.

(Russian)

28:44

But, with all my heart and in the name of all members of the Academy

of Arts and Science,

(Russian)

I would like to make this present to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. This

is a reproduction of ...

Madona Lita (Mona Lita) which you can find in vintage by Leonardo Da Vinci,

29:39

(Russian)

And last, we have really to watch out for our own behaviour, not to do

any negative things.

For our compatriots and all our countries, we say ....

30:06

They would say, that Sahaja Yoga really the best representative of

humanity in all countries.

That is our purpose.

(applause)....

(Talk of Shri Mataji)

30:33

I don’t know, but, how to say, as to the Russian scholars and scientists.

Scientists are amoral people because science is amoral. But, I was surprised, that in

In (Leningrad), thanks to Professor, we have about 2,000 scientists,

I don’t know; 10,000 probably who honoured me so much.

And, I told you about one centre, that is Swadishthan. How Swadishthan can ruin your life. And they were listening to me, absolutely with a

wrath attention, alright.

31.42

Very surprisingly, I’ve never seen such scientists. Because they

cannot see something beyond science, and Sahaja yoga is META SCIENCE.

It is beyond science. And when I told them how many diseases are

caused by one centre, they were really amazed, but they were open,

open-minded people and a scientist means an open-minded person.

32:15

I was amazed also, the way they gave me awards. The first award when they gave me, I said what is this. I’m the 10th member of such an old

University where very, very great scientists had got this award. So how can you give me such an honor? So, the professor where now told me that

“’ Mother, these scientists have only worked with the matter, but you have worked with human beings and transformed.

32:53

I was surprised by the way he saw the point. It’s not easy to see this

the point, that transformation of human beings is most important today.

If I had achieved it, it’s nothing great I think, because I knew how to do it.

So it’s nothing great. But I really feel very proud of you that you have achieved it. I have not achieved it. I was born like this.

But you have achieved it.

33:25

So many nations here sitting, enjoying the same beautiful feeling of

your spirit. And they are from different nations, different places,

different religions, and genuinely they are feeling the joy of their

spirit and this is something, once my dream and vision; but I never

thought of Nobel Prize or anything like that.

Because my husband has got all kinds of prizes and he always says due to my wife.

But what I really treasure is this, that is a great country like Russia, where science has to reach it’s heights that they should accept me as a great scientist and academician. It’s something really very remarkable,

though I don’t know if I deserve it or not. But that’s what they feel about it.

(A Voice from the crowd)....

‘There’s no doubt about it’.

(Big applause)

34:40

Moreover, all the false gurus are ban in Russia, but I was surprised

also that they did not ban us.

Apart from that, the Patriarch, who is like a Pope of Leningrad, of the white order, he himself invited me to be there. So, we are entering into the realm of religion also. It’s something not only science but also a religion which is, which has to open eyes and see what have they missed, all the promises that prophets came, that the incarnations came, are to be fulfilled. If they can just see this point, it will be so great. I was surprised also, that Patriarch himself invited me to this Conference.

35:35

So two great things I feel, that not only in science but also in

religion, Sahaja yoga is entering and will remove the darkness of

ignorance.

Another thing, I must tell you that, when I went to Brasilia, which is

the capital of Brazil, the Mayor of Brazil came to receive me and him

gave me the key of Brasilia, saying, “Mother, please look after

Brazil”.

I was really amazed. So, on the political side also, if you start entering into it; our problems should be solved. We should have no problems, we should have no quarrels, no fights, nothing; but let us live with happiness and joy.

36:26

I’m sure, with this, I can see that vision coming through. This vision of mine, of seeing the whole world, in peace and joy enjoying themselves. All of you as he said has, have to help me, have to come up as real great Sahaja yogis.

I don’t know sir how to thank you very much because I have no words. But he has been meeting me for three-four years, and I was surprised, such a learned man and such an educated person, and how he could see the subtle side of life. And that they discuss morality. All the time all the subject was that of morality.

There was a gentleman who was a surgeon, who is 80 years, (not audible).

37:24

That surgeon, very old, but he is still doing operations, he’s still doing operations.

Ans he’s the one who wrote against alcohol and I was really surprised, (not audible)...

Alright.

37:44

He wrote a book against alcohol, in a country where Vodka is so common. But just imagine, and these people listen to their elders.

They are not like Western people who do not care for their elders. They listen

to their elders, who are very wise.

One day, I’m sure Russia will be one of the most important religious countries. It will have such a big name one day because they have taken to truth and not to non-sensical things.

And I’m sure this will prove to the whole world that truth is what it

is, we should ask.

We should not get in anyway dominated by untruth because untruth would

never bring joy or peace.

38:43

Actually, I’m overwhelmed by what he had said and I’m happy. He had made you so happy also by saying this, beautiful things about me. But I

must tell you, I’m a very humble housewife. That’s all I am. But if you think I’m more than that, I’m not going to challenge.

Now, we have to thank these people, the French people, for organizing this

beautiful program and this, despite all of our problems and also to

everyday work so hard, because they were only 40 Sahaja yogis in Turkey and they have done such dedicated work and so capable they are.

39:30

I’m amazed to see this kind of industrious I should say very hardworking,

very hard. And all the problems are solved here. They say, ‘Mother

you have solved all the problems’,

39:50

Now, I would say, the marriages had been done, very gracefully. Now,

don’t spoil your marriages and create problems for me. That’s all I

want to know, that you all have very nice children and that you create a

society and help the society of great peacemakers.

Thank you very much. Thank you.

(applause)...

This is a little present for you,
