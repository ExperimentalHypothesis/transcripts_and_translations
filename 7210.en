Interview with Ray Martin on TV Channel Nine (from the original tv broadcast). Australia, 8 May 1987.

[Only the first 6 minutes]

Interviewer: Welcome. 
I guess Indian gurus have been involved in the West… But there have been others, for more credible and far more respectable.
My next guess is a Bombay lady who’s following this ? over the world. She says that you have the power to deal positively with every problem from commun to cancer. 
All you have to do is now have a tempt into it, a step in that power. Would you please welcome the lady who … mother of Sahaja Yoga Shri Mataji [applause]
Welcome. 
I know it’s very difficult for you if someone wants to sum up one religion but is it possible to say what is Sahaja Yoga? 

Shri Mataji: Now. Sahaja- saha means with, ja is born with you. This is born with you. Within us is the power which can give us the status of a Spirit. We are not yet the Spirit. We are at a human level. And, in the evolutionary process we have to now, have the breakthrough to become the Spirit. That’s really essential and is absolutely eventually the all possible natural thing that has to happen. It should happen to all of us and the time has come for you to get to that position where you become the Spirit. 
All the religions have talked about it and told about it. But people have gone wrong in believing that artificially, if you say that you are baptised or you have become a Brahmin, or you have become a pire [Arabic word for sage] that you have become the Spirit. 
It’s not that. It’s a happening that has to take place within ourselves, which is a living process, absolutely living process of the living divine force within ourselves. 

Interviewer: How does this-we’ve heard about a lot of Yogas, how does this is different from any other Yogas? 

Shri Mataji: Other Yogas have been practiced mostly after getting Realization but as it has come from some half-baked people, it is in a very funny way that people follow it, as if they have to take all the medicines together. And they don’t know any discrimination about it. Unless and until you make this force rise within you, you will not know what type of attention is needed and what type of physical exercise is needed. Indiscriminately people are do physical exercises, getting into troubles. 

Interviewer: Now you’re speaking of a force, is it possible to speak about where this force emanate from? 

Shri Mataji: This force is a residual power in our triangular bone called as sacrum. 
Interviewer: Sacrum? 
Shri Mataji: Sacrum. 
Interviewer: OK. 
Shri Mataji: Now the sacrum is a word, comes from Greece and that means Greek people knew this was a sacred bone. It rises from there, passes through our six centres, pierces through our fontanel bone area, and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of our head. 
Interviewer: That was Christians have said. 
Shri Mataji: Yes. I mean, Holy Ghost, what is the Holy Ghost? Nobody can explain. But Holy Ghost is very simple to understand. This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us. Holy Ghost is the desire of God. God Himself watches the working of the desire. And the desire is that we all should become the Spirit. And this desire is reflected in our triangular bone, in three and a half coils. When we- 
Interviewer: Is this the central nervous system? 
Shri Mataji: No. It is in the triangular bone. It’s this force, it is the fourth force, you see? 
Interviewer: Ok 
Shri Mataji: We have sympathetic nervous system, left and right, and we have got autonomous- that is an autonomous nervous system, and parasympathetic and we have also central nervous system. Now this is the system which is not yet working, it is still in the triangular bone. When it rises, it gives you a new dimension of the Spirit, means the light of the Spirit comes in our attention. In that case, what happens? It’s very simple to understand that at human level we are not in the absolute sate, not in the absolute state that’s why there’s a chaos.  
Supposing I’m holding a snake in my hand, you see, and there’s no light. Somebody tells me that there’s a snake, I will not throw it away. I would not like to listen to any body’s advise about it. But if there’s a light, I will throw it away. In the same way, when you become the Spirit, the light of the Spirit guides you, you become your own master, you become your own guru, you don’t have to have any guru for that. This piercing of the fontanel bone by the Kundalini gives you the power of the Spirit. 
Interviewer: But .. we’ll give you a chance to demonstrate it but you talk about a physical power of Spirit that come out the top of your head.
Shri Mataji: No it’s an energy.
Interviewer:  An energy alright. 
Shri Mataji: It’s an energy which comes out of your fontanel bone, here, area, touching the Spirit. But the Spirit actually resides in the heart. But the main seat of the heart is here, in the fontanel bone area. And it pierces through, when it pierces through, actually it should pierce, it’s not just I say I’ve baptised you, it’s not like that. It has to pierce through that and you have to feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on top of your head. 
Interviewer:  Is it there now? 
Shri Mataji: Yes it’s there. 
Interviewer:  Can I feel it? 
Shri Mataji: I don’t know if you’ll feel it or not, because you’ll have to have that sensitivity. Now you see, all around also that all-pervading power is there which makes everything vibrate. But this energy can be felt only when you have got that Realization. Then what happens, that all your centres, on your finger tips, become sensitive. And you can feel- this is written in the Koran- that your hands will speak when you’ll get to your resurrection. 
Interviewer:  Yes. 
This is a resurrection. 
Interviewer: But Mataji, you must know, you must realize … you must live with the sceptics and the doubters because –
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course, I’m living with them al the time. 
Interviewer:  …before you. 
[Shri Mataji: is laughing]
Shri Mataji: Now firstly you see, the great mistake we commit, as far as going to guru or to anything that is religious, is that you cannot pay for God. You see, it’s a living process of a living God.   
Now supposing you want to sprout a seed. How much money do you pay to the Mother Earth. It’s a very simple thing but people don’t understand. They think that they can purchase everything. 
You cannot purchase God. A simple method if you apply to all of them, they will all run away. 
Interviewer: Yes. Now I read that the spiritual part you speak off can deal with … cancer? 
Shri Mataji: Yes
Interviewer: With AIDS… 6:59
Shri Mataji: Yes, it does. Because, see, I’ll show you now. This is.
