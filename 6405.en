b'Birthday Puja. New Delhi (India), 20 March 1995.\n\nTranslation from Hindi:\n\nWhat can one say on one\xe2\x80\x99s own Birthday.\xc2\xa0 That which I have never dreamed possible, has happened here today. So many of you have come into Sahaja Yoga and are sitting here today in front of Me. What better Birthday can there be for a Mother.\xc2\xa0 You have received your self realisation.\xc2\xa0 So this is also your Birthday.\xc2\xa0 You have prepared yourselves for a great happening, and such a great event has never happened before.\xc2\xa0 You are the functionaries, who will manage this great job.\xc2\xa0 What greater cause for joy can I have.\xc2\xa0 I never imagined that in My lifetime I will see before Me, such a large number of realised souls, and that I will experience the greatest joy and happiness.\n\nThe speciality of the present, prevailing conditions, is that the world is that human beings are spinning in an atmosphere of illusion and confusion.\xc2\xa0 When we turn our attention to the other countries outside, we see that they have completely lost their moorings.\xc2\xa0 There is no meaning in morality, ethical character or standards.\xc2\xa0 It is considered brave and courageous to aggress others.\xc2\xa0 And their destination is directly to hell.\xc2\xa0 And it seems impossible to stop their progress towards their destruction.\xc2\xa0 But even among them, there were gems who realised what a meaningless existence they were living.\n\nOn the other hand we can see that fanatics created very difficult conditions for human beings.\xc2\xa0 They were forced to bind themselves to some beliefs, and if they resisted there was religious intolerance, excessive pressure, and torture.\n\nSo, you should thank your good fortune that you were born in this (punya bhoomi) auspicious land of Bharat (India), which has a balanced culture.\xc2\xa0 We have not been told much about dharma, because basically Indians live within dharmas.\xc2\xa0 They do not stoop to adharmic life.\xc2\xa0 Most of them.\xc2\xa0 It is a different case when he suddenly gets a lot of wealth he goes off his head, and enters politics; or enters into ignoble money making activities, and might go astray.\xc2\xa0 But even in that condition he does not have the courage to misbehave openly.\xc2\xa0 Because the society is so strict that they will take him to task.\xc2\xa0 That is why, what I am going to say to you today is this, that the culture of this country is of a very high level, and it is still recognised as such.\xc2\xa0 And most of the people understand moral ethics, and that is how they have achieved all this.\n\nThis achievement has been accomplished by the women of India.\xc2\xa0 This is the shakti (power) of women.\xc2\xa0 And with the help of this shakti they have been able to stabilise their families, their children, and the whole society.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately the western culture is slowly seeping into this country, and it is possible that we can get influenced by it, but hopefully they will not go to excess.\xc2\xa0 Because we are deeply anchored in the traditions of our country.\xc2\xa0 Our country is so auspicious and fortunate that mahatmas (great souls) one greater than the other have been created.\xc2\xa0 So many saints, and so many divine incarnations.\xc2\xa0 Not only in the hindu dharma, but among Muslims, and as you know among the Sikhs.\xc2\xa0 Big, big Mahatmas have been produced.\n\nThe speciality of this country is that in the soil of this country there exists (adhyatma) spiritual knowledge.\xc2\xa0 No wonder people turn towards adhyatmic life.\xc2\xa0 In the system of Sahaja Yoga we are standing in complete balance.\xc2\xa0 Like, if there is any impurity in the Indian culture, it has to be rooted out.\xc2\xa0 After coming into Sahaja Yoga a lot of people get rid of most of their bad habits and behaviour.\n\nBut I see sometimes that some Sahaja Yogis are still attached to their old ways.\xc2\xa0 Because they find it difficult to give up the old bad habits which have been practised in the past.\xc2\xa0 Especially in North India, where we are sitting at the moment.\xc2\xa0 I have noticed that, whether from the influence of muslim rulers, or something else, the plight of women is very bad.\xc2\xa0 They are always the targets for harassment and torture.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Woman, who is the image of the Shakti, is not honoured and respected.\xc2\xa0 There is a saying that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere women are respected and honoured, in that place the Gods reside\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Where the woman is treated with kindness and honour, the Gods happily roam, or stroll.\n\nThis does not mean that I am recommending woman\xe2\x80\x99s rule, or that they should dictate terms.\xc2\xa0 In the first place a woman should be worthy of honour and respect.\xc2\xa0 She should have all the venerable qualities within her.\xc2\xa0 If she disrespects her husband, causes fights and disruption of peace in the household, troubles everyone, does not take care of the children; and all other wrong behaviour, then such a women cannot be respected.\xc2\xa0 Only such a woman is worthy of honour and respect, whose heart is full of love and kindness.\xc2\xa0 The woman who has an ocean of love within her, such a woman is loved and respected by society.\xc2\xa0 If she is not, then people talk and gossip about her bad character.\n\nIn our society we recognise the woman as the Shakti.\xc2\xa0 Now all these lighting arrangements that have been made, are not the (shakti) energy.\xc2\xa0 The energy is coming from somewhere else.\xc2\xa0 It is only manifesting the light over here.\xc2\xa0 In the same way a woman is the embodiment of Shakti; but the manifestation of the shakti is in the form of man; can be seen in her children, her relations, in her husband, in her father-in-law, her father, etc..\xc2\xa0 All these people become drenched in her shakti, and there is a rare and beautiful relationship\xc2\xa0 where the mother of the house, the wife of the house, becomes the firm foundation.\n\nBut instead, if the woman is filled with anger, hatred, and dissatisfaction, then in such a household there can never be love and joy.\xc2\xa0 This is the biggest responsibility of the woman.\xc2\xa0 They should not feel that it is a burden, or they are being suppressed.\xc2\xa0 On the contrary they should be proud that this is their responsibility and they are performing it with love.\n\nThis understanding has to enter the minds of the people.\xc2\xa0 The woman has been suppressed and been neglected to such an extent, that a new trend of thought has arisen within women, that we will not allow this suppression and demeaning of women.\xc2\xa0 We will put men in their place, and we will prove our equality in every way (Women\xe2\x80\x99s Lib!)\xc2\xa0 We will make them appear useless and incompetent\n\nAll this has been done and tried.\xc2\xa0 In all the countries where this woman power is working out, just take a look at the state of their children.\xc2\xa0 And look at the condition of everything.\n\nNow what is the solution.\xc2\xa0 Everyone must recognise the futility of this reaction.\xc2\xa0 This understanding must come, not only to the women, but also to the men.\xc2\xa0 The men should recognise the fact that our women are the embodiment of sakshat Lakshmi (verily).\xc2\xa0 And we should respect that in her.\xc2\xa0 Of course the woman has to respect the man, the husband.\xc2\xa0 And the husband should respect the wife.\xc2\xa0 I now see that slowly our society is improving in this regard.\n\nNow, when we conduct Sahaja Yoga marriages we have seen that Indian girls who are married into foreign countries, their husbands treat them with such respect and love, that their brains go out of balance.\xc2\xa0 Not everyone\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 Not everyone\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 And on the other hand, where foreign girls are married into Indian families, they cry \xe2\x80\x9cGod save us from mothers-in-law\xe2\x80\x9d and all other problems.\xc2\xa0 So there is no balance, either here or there.\xc2\xa0 Sahaja Yogis have to learn how to maintain this balance.\xc2\xa0 This does not mean that you make your husband sit on your head.\xc2\xa0 What is required is an evaluation.\n\nIn this evaluation you can see how far we have been able to bring ourselves into balance.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t judge others.\xc2\xa0 Look at yourselves.\xc2\xa0 Wherever you have to say something you must say it\xc2\xa0 And, whatever you have to listen to, you have to listen.\xc2\xa0 I have seen to it that we started Sahaja Yoga first with the family.\xc2\xa0 From the (Kutumbh avastha) family foundation we have slowly built it up.\xc2\xa0 And once the \xe2\x80\x9ckutumbh\xe2\x80\x9d was established, then we went further, one step at a time.\n\nI am sure you are aware that this Sahastrar Day will be the 25th Sahastrar Day.\xc2\xa0 25 years have passed since Sahastrara was opened.\xc2\xa0 From that time people have been receiving self realisation, and by that they were drenched and nourished, and have reached this present state.\n\nNow, what is our next responsibility. \xc2\xa0We started with the \xe2\x80\x9ckutumbh\xe2\x80\x9d (family), so we have to establish peace within the family.\xc2\xa0 But first and foremost thing is peace.\xc2\xa0 Where there is no peace, nothing can grow.\xc2\xa0 Now imaging if these flower pots that are here, are constantly agitated and moving about, will the plants be able to grow?\xc2\xa0 They will wilt.\xc2\xa0 So first of all we have to establish peace.\xc2\xa0 In this we have to respect the man, and the woman, and also have understanding.\xc2\xa0 So in a household if there is peace first of all, then only our children will feel secure and safe.\xc2\xa0 And with this security the children will greatly understand their inner being.\xc2\xa0 That our parents are Sahaja Yogis, and we are also Sahaja Yogis, and that we have to bring honour and glory to the name of our parents.\n\nNow I see that slowly, slowly Sahaja Yoga has spread and grown in the society.\xc2\xa0 It has also spread in cities and states.\xc2\xa0 Like a lot of people from various states have come \xe2\x80\x93 some from Madras, some from Mumbai, or Maharashtra.\xc2\xa0 And then we see that it has spread from country to country also.\xc2\xa0 But in this also a kind of differentiation has come in.\n\nLike the Delhi people came and said, Shree Mataji, Your Birthday should be celebrated in Delhi only.\xc2\xa0 Now we will have to agree.\xc2\xa0 Who can refuse Delhi people that we cannot have the Birthday here!\xc2\xa0 O My!\xc2\xa0 So I peacefully agreed.\xc2\xa0 It will be best to have it in Delhi only; and here the arrangements are done well, and everyone is looked after.\xc2\xa0 So taking everything into consideration I said Yes.\n\nBut in that, to start thinking that we are Dilli or Billi (Delhi rhyming with Cat) people, they can start a fight on this issue.\xc2\xa0 Now this is a very limited, ungenerous attitude which is emerging.\xc2\xa0 This means we have made a mistake in understanding the \xe2\x80\x9ccollective\xe2\x80\x9d aspect of Sahaja Yoga.\xc2\xa0 If we do not understand the delicacy of collectivity, then the whole balance will become shaky.\n\nSupposing this time I say, OK, this time let us have it in Mumbai; or anywhere else; what does it matter.\xc2\xa0 It will just be one more birthday, and I am going to get older.\xc2\xa0 Every birthday increases My age.\xc2\xa0 So, celebrating it anywhere, what does it matter.\xc2\xa0 But\xc2\xa0 then people start wondering, why did Shree Mataji make this decision.\xc2\xa0 Have we committed some mistake.\xc2\xa0 Or they will come and ask, Shree Mataji, why did You decide like this. Last time You did not have it in Delhi, so why not have it in Delhi this time.\xc2\xa0 So there appears to be a misunderstanding of \xe2\x80\x9cTadatma\xe2\x80\x9d universality of the atma or Spirit. And a misidentification that we are residents of this place, or that place.\n\nIn the past there was differentiation even between people of one street and another.\xc2\xa0 Now at least this is finished.\xc2\xa0 Then there were differences between different areas within a state, and they even used to sit in groups according to their addresses.\xc2\xa0 And I used to watch in dismay, that this is still prevalent.\xc2\xa0 Gradually they got out of that.\xc2\xa0 But now I see that the divisions are by language spoken.\xc2\xa0 Like we speak this language, they speak another language, and so on.\n\nSo I feel that at least we should all know the language of our country, the National language.\xc2\xa0 We should all learn it, whether we are hindus, muslims, or Maharashtrians or Christians.\xc2\xa0 So we should all know the Hindi language.\xc2\xa0 How can I alone speak in the 14 Indian languages?\xc2\xa0 So we should all see what language our Mother speaks.\xc2\xa0 I know Hindi, although I did not study it formally.\xc2\xa0 I know Hindi very well.\xc2\xa0 So I would suggest that all of you should learn the Hindi language.\xc2\xa0 It will be a great favour to Sahaja Yoga. \xc2\xa0And you will also benefit.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people outside India have learned Hindi, just to be able to listen to My Hindi lectures.\xc2\xa0 They have started speaking and understanding Hindi.\xc2\xa0 But in this country there are still people who say \xe2\x80\x93 Shri Mataji, please do not give your talk in Hindi.\xc2\xa0 If possible please speak in Tamil or Telugu.\xc2\xa0 I am sorry, but I do not know either Tamil or Telugu.\xc2\xa0 Now what should I do.\xc2\xa0 That is why we should totally get rid of all these various differences.\n\nThe caste difference is already born with us since long.\xc2\xa0 One gentleman in Hongkong told me that in India there is a lot of caste system.\xc2\xa0 Even among Sahaja Yogis there is caste consciousness.\xc2\xa0 He is himself a brahmin.\xc2\xa0 So I asked him, Tell Me, will you be prepared to marry a Harijan girl (one of the lowest in the so called caste system).\xc2\xa0 He got flustered.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWith a Harijan\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\xc2\xa0 So I said Hari-jans are People of Hari (Vishniu).\xc2\xa0 He flatly refused.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI cant marry a Harijan girl\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSo if we surrender all our conditionings slowly, slowly, we can get rid of everything.\xc2\xa0 But in foreign countries this is not an issue.\xc2\xa0 So many of our sweet Harijan girls have been married to Yogis outside India.\xc2\xa0 And so also Harijan boys.\xc2\xa0 They are not aware that such a thing as caste exists.\n\nIn this way we have so many petty differences within us, that, we are different, they are different.\xc2\xa0 Now it is important to be different.\xc2\xa0 God has created every one different.\xc2\xa0 If he had every one look alike, we would never be able to recognise one from the other.\xc2\xa0 Like everyone with uniform figure and feature, in an army.\xc2\xa0 Even leaves have been created different.\xc2\xa0 No two leaves are the same.\xc2\xa0 If you take one leaf and try to find a same similar leaf in the whole world, you will not find one.\xc2\xa0 Just imagine.\xc2\xa0 This is His consummate skill.\xc2\xa0 Now if you feel that it is unique to be different, you are on the same level as a leaf.\n\nIf you rise above all this and look at yourself as a Yogi, who has no differences in caste, colour or creed, then you will become liike a sanyasi of the scriptures, who does not have any false identification.\xc2\xa0 Once you drop all this, you become a sanyasi from within.\xc2\xa0 How can you maintain caste and breed once you are a saint.\xc2\xa0 In fact we should oppose such conditionings.\xc2\xa0 We should protest against these beliefs, and only look for qualities within human beings.\xc2\xa0 We should imbibe and understand qualities.\xc2\xa0 When we adopt these maryadas, (codes of conduct), then we can form connections with other countries.\n\nWhat can I tell you about the people I have met in foreign countries.\xc2\xa0 They recognise\xc2\xa0 technology and science.\xc2\xa0 But when they entered Sahaja Yoga it was as if they had dissolved into the ocean of love.\xc2\xa0 Do you know that 500 people have come from other countries.\xc2\xa0 They have so much love for Me.\xc2\xa0 They say \xe2\x80\x93 Shree Mataji, when we feel love for you, we get enveloped and encompassed with an endless ocean of love.\xc2\xa0 Even during the Quwalli program, they do not understand the language but they were filled with bliss and joy.\xc2\xa0 We have to learn a lesson from them to be Nirvach (love without any expectation).\xc2\xa0 Their only desire is to feel divine love.\xc2\xa0 We do not seem to know or understand the value of this love.\n\nWe are only involved with our relations.\xc2\xa0 Like my father is sick; or my father\xe2\x80\x99s father-in-law is sick, or some far off relation is sick; someone does not have a job; I have become bankrupt; my brother is being sent to jail.\xc2\xa0 This is the only kind of messages I get.\xc2\xa0 For some there is a feeling that they have a right on Me and My time, maybe because I am also born in India, or that they are also born in India.\xc2\xa0 But this is a very petty thing.\xc2\xa0 If you are a Sahaja Yogi you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to ask for anything.\xc2\xa0 These things can work out spontaneously.\xc2\xa0 This faith, the foreigners have.\n\nNow let me tell you a very surprising thing.\xc2\xa0 There was a lady working in the UN, Sahaja Yogini, she was sent to Mexico by the UN.\xc2\xa0 She had a son who had such an illness that kept getting worse and worse.\xc2\xa0 It galloped, and within one month the child nearly died.\xc2\xa0 He was not a Sahaja Yogi.\xc2\xa0 She sent me three letters in which she mentioned the name of the illness.\xc2\xa0 A very strong and unusual illness, and she sent three letters.\xc2\xa0 I felt a great compassion for her.\xc2\xa0 What can I say in human language --\xc2\xa0 a kind of a pull.\xc2\xa0 A pull from her.\xc2\xa0 Imagine, a fourth letter came that \xe2\x80\x9cShree Mataji, it is amazing and astounding.\xc2\xa0 I took my son to the hospital, and they said all the tests are negative.\xc2\xa0 He is completely free of the disease.\n\nBut it is not so with Indians.\xc2\xa0 They will \xe2\x80\x9cwant to meet Shree Mataji.\xc2\xa0 Only if Shree Mataji sees my son he will be cured\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 They feel that without putting the problem on My Head, nothing will happen.\xc2\xa0 Such a glaring difference.\xc2\xa0 She was in Mexico, sitting with the knowledge that there was no treatment or cure for her son, and she was just praying and sending these letters to Me.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xc2\xa0 Now this is a matter of Shraddha (enlightened faith).\xc2\xa0 When love becomes enlightened faith, (I am not talking about blind faith).\xc2\xa0 You know My Views on blind faith.\xc2\xa0 But if the love becomes enlightened faith, then how things work out is a matter for giving thought.\xc2\xa0 If there is no faith, but just a statement that I believe a lot in Shree Mataji it will not work.\xc2\xa0 Such kind of devotees are there who worship Christ, who worship Mohammed Sahib.\xc2\xa0 But what about you.\xc2\xa0 What is special inside you.\xc2\xa0 What have you achieved, is what you have to consider.\n\nSo what I have seen that whatever these people believed so easily, they have dissolved themselves into the Divine Love.\xc2\xa0 They have never experienced such love before.\xc2\xa0 And when they get the Divine Love, they become fully drawn and dissolved into it.\xc2\xa0 And then after getting this Love, they don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything else from the world.\xc2\xa0 Nothing.\n\nNow those who come to Ganapatiphule \xe2\x80\x93 the Indians, have a lot of complaints.\xc2\xa0 The food was not good.\xc2\xa0 The man from Madras will say I could not eat the food as it was not good.\xc2\xa0 Lucknow people will say \xe2\x80\x93 what kind of food did they serve up.\xc2\xa0 All their fuss about the taste of food has been encouraged by their wives, who cater to every whim of the husband.\xc2\xa0 Now tell Me which single type of food can we make which will please every Indian palate.\xc2\xa0 Man from this State does not like that food;\xc2\xa0 man from that State does not like this food.\xc2\xa0 But these people from outside, will never complain about the food, even though in the early days the food was not up to standard.\xc2\xa0 Nowadays it has improved.\xc2\xa0 But they never ever said that Shree Mataji the food was not good.\n\nNow regarding toilets a strange thing is going on.\xc2\xa0 The Indians said Shree Mataji we do not like this Indian style bathrooms.\xc2\xa0 We want western style bathrooms.\xc2\xa0 But the western Yogis said they prefer the Indian toilets because they are cleaner.\xc2\xa0 Now I cant understand what to do.\xc2\xa0 We made these toilets for the Indians, and those toilets for the western Yogis.\xc2\xa0 So I thought of a solution.\xc2\xa0 Shift the Indians to the foreigners side, and move the western Yogis to the Indian side.\xc2\xa0 End of problem!\n\nBut we are very demanding people.\xc2\xa0 All the time finding fault \xe2\x80\x93 this is not nice, that is not nice.\xc2\xa0 Put this right, put that right.\xc2\xa0 How many people have attached baths in their houses, tell Me.\xc2\xa0 We are beginning to feel that by making such demands we are some superior class.\xc2\xa0 And when We speak with western Yogis they say \xe2\x80\x93 Shree Mataji the comforts of the body are useless.\xc2\xa0 We have had enough of it.\xc2\xa0 Now we want comfort of the Spirit.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want comfort of the body.\xc2\xa0 What we never had before Sahaja Yoga we want now as comfort of the Spirit.\xc2\xa0 By telling you this I do not want you to react by sleeping on the bare floor.\xc2\xa0 That is not My motive.\n\nMy reason for telling is this, that we must start realising that we have to do the work of the Spirit.\xc2\xa0 And we should find comfort in everything and everywhere.\xc2\xa0 If we only consider the needs of the body, our Spirit feels hurt.\xc2\xa0 The light of the Spirit will keep reducing.\xc2\xa0 The more we start putting attention on others; on their spiritual growth; on the environment, that much more the light of the Spirit will begin to shine.\xc2\xa0 And you will be surprised that you will find yourself slowly becoming a citizen of the world.\xc2\xa0 The whole world will get contained within you.\n\nNow many people ask Me, Shree Mataji, how do You remember so many things.\xc2\xa0 It is like this \xe2\x80\x93 that when I see something, I see it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xc2\xa0 My Chitta (attention) has noted it.\xc2\xa0 So must you also be.\xc2\xa0 Because I am not inside.\xc2\xa0 I am all pervading.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t even think about Myself.\xc2\xa0 I have no thoughts.\xc2\xa0 The strength to do this is within Me.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to keep sitting and thinking about Myself.\xc2\xa0 I never think, what this one did to Me, or that one did to Me.\xc2\xa0 Never.\xc2\xa0 What has happened, has happened.\xc2\xa0 Finished.\n\nBut whatever is outside, if you can see your own light shining in it, then you have become the whole universe.\xc2\xa0 If you look at a mountain, you can see the light of your Spirit in it.\xc2\xa0 In each and everything.\xc2\xa0 When you see the light of the Spirit in it, then you never forget it.\xc2\xa0 Nor do you forget the joy you got out of it.\xc2\xa0 Then you don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything \xe2\x80\x93 whose carpet is this, where can I get one like it.\xc2\xa0 Nothing.\xc2\xa0 Only the looking at it and enjoying it, is to be done.\xc2\xa0 And when this starts happening, it also starts expanding, and encircles the whole world.\xc2\xa0 And this is the state you have to achieve.\n\nOf course we must have differences.\xc2\xa0 Every person should be different from the other.\xc2\xa0 But, in what way.\xc2\xa0 Each one should be different in the way they feel the joy.\xc2\xa0 Like when people are dancing, every one is feeling the joy, but each one danced differently.\xc2\xa0 No two people were dancing in the same way.\xc2\xa0 So if we have these different feelings inside us, we can give the different experiences of joy to others.\xc2\xa0 Joy is not for yourself.\xc2\xa0 It should always be our endeavour to see how much comfort, love and enjoyment we can give to others with our light.\n\nSometimes,\xc2\xa0 not very often, but sometimes, Indian Sahaja Yogis write and request Me that Shree Mataji, please help me to evolve into a higher state, where I can rise above all these things.\xc2\xa0 Mostly people write useless letters that this one is sick, that one is sick, like this, like that.\xc2\xa0 But some write very sweet letters.\xc2\xa0 And with that I get completely dissolved.\xc2\xa0 And I see that this person has found the way, and knows exactly where he or she is going.\xc2\xa0 He has identified his destination.\xc2\xa0 I do not want anything more than this.\xc2\xa0 I just want to be able to see this, again and again, and unite with that person\xe2\x80\x99s Atma.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to keep writing about your desires to ascend.\xc2\xa0 But just watch how the Divine works.\xc2\xa0 Everything is happening, and you have to move with the flow.\xc2\xa0 And may your lives become filled with joy, and may you be the channels for giving this unique, divine joy (Allahad) to the world.\xc2\xa0 This is what I desire.\xc2\xa0 If any strange and useless thoughts come to you, like you must join politics, there is no need for that.\xc2\xa0 In Sahaja Yoga you are not required to amass wealth; to attain any great position; nothing.\xc2\xa0 The only thing you are required to do is to establish your supporting strength and pure desire that we onluy want to be people who understand the world; who want to improve the world; who want to remove all the impurities, ills and sorrows of the world; and who can give pure knowledge of the Spirit, to all.\xc2\xa0 Only then great and illustrious sons of the earth will be created.\n\nAnd it is My eternal blessing that all of you should take this great spiritual movement forward, and keep introspecting that \xe2\x80\x93 Am I doing the job for which I was born.\n\nEnglish part:\n\nI am sorry I had to speak in Hindi language because the majority of the people know, understand Hindi.\n\nIn the western civilization, suddenly I find people have taken to a very licentious, vulgar, despicable life. I can\'t believe how can they be so stupid and idiotic. It seems they have no wisdom even to see that this is stupidity.\n\nThank God, you have achieved this Self-Realization, you got the Light, you are so transformed, you look so beautiful. And that you have given up all those funny ideas of freedom. It\'s so clear cut. This must be, I don\'t know what to say, that in those western countries, to find out people who have such wise understanding of pure love and respect for your own purity. As if suddenly you have come out of that darkness and have bathed in the light of the divine. It\'s not possible otherwise. See the history of the western countries is they never had very great kings, you know. One king in England, killed seven wives, you know. If you,(Shri Mataji Corrects herself) In India if one wife was killed he would have been killed, first of all, before he killed the second one. So, one sees that, despite all that kind of a history and that kind of a vulgarity that has been going on for days together and now it is the worst after war.\n\nSuddenly you people have come up like lotuses and have made those countries so fragrant and so beautiful. But now they are afraid because they believe in licentiousness, they believe in vulgarity. They think it is their freedom, so they do attack, but you are not to be bothered because you have achieved something that is real, that is for eternal life. They supposed to be Christians, Jews and also Muslims there. Among all of them I am surprised to see how they have interpreted these three great religions, in the most contradictory way. For Christ has said that if you make any sin with your eyes, commit some sins, then remove your eyes, yourself. If one hand does anything wrong, you cut that hand. I have never seen anybody without an eye or without a hand in the whole of this Christian kingdoms, nowhere. They can cut other\'s, but their own eyes I have never seen.\n\nIt is very difficult to be a Christian, I tell you, because this is an impossible situation. For that, we can say that it, this was for angels, must be, for the fallen angels that you take out your eye and cut your hand. And then Mohammed Sahib has said, he thought that why only the men are handled by Christ. So he says no no, not that you cut it, but let others cut your hand and take out your eyes. And for women it is so- that they should be buried in the Mother Earth half way and should be stoned. Think of American women, what would have happened to them? So, very difficult to follow Islam also. Impossible.\n\nThey were very great people, very pure and they thought that this is the only way people can be kept pure. No, on the contrary with all these thing - compulsion they become extremely immoral. This suppression doesn\'t help. And then also, this they call it one that is Islamic laws - Sharia, was actually given by Moses to Jews. You can find it out in the Bible. It was given by Moses to Jews and the Jews would not accept it because they were sensible to say, we can\'t accept this much, too much. So that was taken over by Mohammed Sahib, better put it for these people. But with all this doing, people become extremely immoral, extremely quarrelsome and go to the other side and such an imbalance is created.\n\nBut after Self-Realisation, the Sahaja culture is born within you. With the Sahaja culture you come into balance and people are surprised at the western Sahaja Yogis, that Mother how have you made their eyes so pure? How can they get rid of these bad habits of looking at every woman or every man? What have you done to their eyes? How have they become so pure? It is the light of your own spirit, which is shinning through your eyes. It\'s very important.\n\nAgain, I would say, that the women in the west have to understand what is Sahaja Yoga. Not dominating anyone. Here the women are dominated, not always but to great extent. And there what you find that women are dominating. Firstly they believe in divorce and they try to harass people with that. This domination, may be we can say comes from their upbringing. But Sahaja Yoga should change completely your ideas, and there should be no domination but a complete understanding about which I have told you many a times and explained to you.\n\nStill I must say I am overwhelmed by the response. And on behalf of the divine power, I would like to thank you very much. It is really a new race that has come up, really. Somewhere, somebody goes wrong or something happens. Doesn\'t matter. On the whole it\'s such a beautiful race of people. I face them before me. Even in dreams people could not have believed it. They don\'t yet believe. But it has happened, you must now have an enlightened faith, which we call as \'Shraddha\'. With that enlightened faith I am sure you will adhere to the emancipation of human beings. It\'s your duty now. It is all given free. Of course, Sahaja Yoga is free. You can have it free; you don\'t have to pay anything, all right. But, you have to give to others. That is very important. It is free to you and you cannot keep it to yourself. If you keep it to yourself, you can never be happy, you can never be joyous. So you have to be absolutely collective and then you will see how it works out. Very surprising in all the European countries, in America, South America, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Kuala Lumpur, everywhere. I have seen people have become collective and they told me Mother, there is no greater joy than seeing people getting Self-Realization. That is the greatest joy one has. And this is what, one has to have in your mind. Of course there are some people who start criticizing Sahaja Yoga - why this, why that? All nonsense. But actually if you see, everybody who is a deep Sahaja Yogi wants that Sahaja Yoga should spread in their own countries and then to see that it is accepted all over the world. It is such a wisdom, which has come into their mind.\n\nOtherwise, one fellow told me, "Mother, I was only worried about my own house, my family, motorcar and this and that. Now forgotten all that Now I am only worried how will I be able to give this joy to others. I cannot be happy alone. And that\'s what it has happened."\n\nAnd I am very thankful to you, for all of you, who have come here all the way to celebrate my birthday. And this is just your love and affection for me, and I also love you very much.\n\nMay God bless you.\n\nToday\'s Puja is going to be bit short. Because I don\'t know what, ah, in my birthday which deity\'s Puja you are doing. Where there are all dieties, all of them are there. So it has to be short, with all of them being worshipped together, it works out much faster, I think. As when you, all of you are together, things work out much faster.\n\nH.H.
