VIP Conference in Central Park, New York, USA. 15 June 1999.

[Laughter]  That's a realized.  You see it is not that you are doing anything, it is the Divine that is doing all the things and once this detachment comes you don't get into funny ideas.  You see I'm this, calling this [??] and now we have, you must have heard, that we have Sahaja Yoga working in so many countries.  Every year I hear one country is added.  Now the thing is, most beautiful thing for Me to see all of them together and I was amazed.  They come from all kinds of communities, from all kinds of countries, from all kinds of religions, from everywhere they never fight, never fight.  Of course they pull each others legs, have lot of fun and all that.  And they are always joyous, very happy.  Now why is it?  What is happening?  Now the first fundamental truth is that all of us, whether you are white, black, brown, yellow, any colour, whatever community, whatever country you may be coming from all of you have one thing, that is Kundalini, this power within you.  It doesn't differentiate.  Only we mentally differentiate like this, that this one this is like this and this one is like that.  And we have different, different roots are there.  That's our mind which gets little distracted.  But for Kundalini who is your Mother, your individual Mother, is reflected in every person wherever you may go.  I mean we have people in very remote places like Benin, the people from Benin you know.  And then we have people from Eritrea, imagine, the Ministers, the Prime Minister of Eritrea are Sahaja yogis.  But they are very humble people, they are very humble, and they take [??] that they are to be born to other peace.  They have to have peace, now how do you get peace within yourselves?  That I will explain to you, but frankly the subject is very wide but the best thing is for you to get your Realization.

Peace is like this, what happens is that we go on reacting.  Now for example I've come here now (Mother looks at the furnishings) trying to see from where it has come, which part of India how many of this and how many pieces and My mind starts working.  Then I start thinking how much would it cost if I have to buy it.  Now supposing it belonged to Me then I would be much more worried that nobody spoils it, nobody pulls it down.  You see it's like this.  So the reactions can be of two types, so we get worried about it, or sometimes you do feel happy.  But all the time the mind is active, it's reacting all the time.  You cannot witness the whole thing.  But what happens, that when Kundalini rises your thoughts which are coming from the future and the past are all there on your head.  And they are bombarding you.  But when Kundalini rises she elongates the thoughts and there's a space created in between.  Now this space is the place where the [Chitta ?] comes from, and once you have become thoughtlessly aware, which Jung has talked about, Jung has talked.  This thoughtless awareness was stayed, when it happens, you become absolutely peaceful.  Because you are in the present, you are not in the past nor in the future, but you are in the present.  And when you are in the present what you feel is the peace of a witness.  You witness.  You see everything.  It's like a picture so it comes to you.  Your memory becomes just like a photographic memory and you see everything so clearly whenever you want to.

It's very simple, for small things, for big things, you don't have to worry about your memory.  I'm very old according to the time I was born but My memory is excellent.  I mean, I must say that I don't know how people forget things but I don't.  If I see somebody's face I'll definitely remember everything.  Maybe names I may little bit get confused because you know what names are like.  People give whatever name they feel like, has no meaning, at least in India names have meaning so we can remember.  But other names sometimes are so funny, so long, so short, that you don't know how to remember.  But that's not the thing, the main thing is that you are kept all the time absolutely alert.  Alert about everything.  Actually, if that alertness comes into us then we will be alert also about ourselves.  Why are we doing this?  Say you go to some newspaper, My experience has not been very good I think they have not been kind to Me at all, but they should see what is their responsibility.  Are they responsible?  Do they feel that whatever is the truth are they representing or are they trying up to make up a story, something bombastic, something sensational, something which is not true.  So first thing should be that we have to think that we will know the truth and we'll keep the truth, we'll talk the truth.  But for that you don't have to go to the court with your hands on the Bible, or a Gita, but you have to say yourself on your heart.  And it just happens.  You can't do anything wrong.  Because you see the power of truth, is very great.  It will keep you all the time in so much in very joyous mood.  It gives you joy.

Joy is singular, it is not like unhappiness and happiness, joy is singular.  You are in joy and that joy is of love.  Love and affection and compassion, everybody's heart is full of it.  But we don't open our heart, we are so afraid you know, if I open My heart what will happen, this thing.  But it doesn't mean the perversion.  Now, because we have not expressed our true love, it's getting perverted.  Most of your problems come from that perversion.  If you could open the heart of the people in the right way it will give you that joy which is described in all the scriptures.  I am not against any religion, against anything, but I must tell you the religion has taken a new course.  In case religion becomes power orientated, money orientated, then it's not a religion.  It has to be spirit orientated.  I must tell you frankly, if it is not spirit orientated it's not a religion.  Absolutely, it has to be spirit orientated.  Now in any religion, whatever it is they have, every religion they have said that you have to know yourself.  Everybody has said it and the time has come.  This is a special time when people are going to get their Self-Realization.

My contribution to all this is only very simple.  That I'd tell that way to one, give Realization to one person, because I was born like this would not be of any help because they'd crucify that person, or kill that person, torture that person.  People don't want to see anybody outstanding you know, so we also get tried to trouble, but it's all right, they are ignorant, I don't mind.  Now, so this actual understanding of the whole thing should be such that if you rise above your awareness, the awareness itself gets enlightened.  You can feel vibrations you can easily say who is a realized soul, who is not a realized soul.  That's how I said that William Blake was realized soul, Abraham Lincoln was a realized soul, because you can feel the vibrations.  They are dead but still you can feel.  You can feel vibrations from so many things that you can feel that this is the place where some great man must have lived, that's why there are vibrations.  It's not a myth it's actualization.  It just happens you can see the actualization of the baptism you can call it and actually it happens.  It's not just talking, saying this, that, money collection, but it is the mind within us which is awakened.

All of us have that so why not get it?  We all have it, and then you can't pay for it.  You can't pay for love can you?  How much have you paid God for our lungs and our heart? Nothing.  In the same way it just works.  It's a living process and every living process, it has no distinction between any kind of personality, they have to be just human beings.  And there are so many children also nowadays born as realized souls.  I was surprised in Dallas now some Sahaja Yogis have started looking after abused children.  I mean this is something I can't understand, the perversion to the last.  But these children are realised souls, that's why they lost, because they are realised souls, so they couldn't bear so they are tortured.  These children are so sweet now, they are always waiting for Sahaja Yogis to come and talk to them.  The people said what have you done, what is so special about you that these children are all the time waiting, asking when are they coming, when are they coming?  Just see how much cruelty you could do in the name of corrections.  Actually it's a sinful act, the way we are disciplining ourselves and disciplining others.

Now all these things are going on around us and we see the world, sometimes you feel that this world will be destroyed or what will happen.  Don't be this frightened, after all the one who has created knows how to save it also.  So it won't be destroyed but someway we destroying themselves, actually we destroy ourselves.  God will never destroy us, that's one thing for sure, but if you want to destroy ourselves we have freedom.  We can do what we like, only we human beings have the freedom.  We can save ourselves or we can save others.  It's such a tremendous thing.  But in America somehow or other I've not been very successful so far.  But the first time we have such a meeting here and I've never met the press anywhere also in America.  But only in any other place now from, somebody has come from Turkey.  Every week they are publishing about Me, in the front.  Imagine in Turkey we have 2000 Sahaja Yogis, they are Muslims, so why in America it doesn't work out I don't know.  Because there is no sensation in it, that's of course very true, no sensation of any kind.  You just jump.  You don't do anything.  Just simple happening, where you are sitting you just get it.  It's relaxation, complete relaxed temperament.  And all the things that are written in that, whatever they have given you, is absolute truth.  There's nothing that is exaggerated and there are many more things you have to do.  But please humble down a little bit and see for yourself that you get it.

All right.  I don't want to speak long because they said there are some people who want to ask Me questions.  So I would like to spare some time for you to ask Me questions.  But the one thing, you see, don't go the way you go about each other, journalism.  Like asking Me why your hair are black, why your hands are like this, why you wear, I mean all sorts of things.  You know I am a married woman, so in a normal way you should ask Me.  I am not a politician, I have nothing to do with your politics I tell you.  This is no politics, I don't call it, we have to have divine politics.  Now divine politics is such, now with all these organisations, so called, of Sahaja Yoga there is no organisation.  We have no secretariat, we have no officers, we have nothing like this.  It just works.  We don't have to do anything because there's collective consciousness.  We are all connected with each other.  It just works.

You know, you'll be amazed how things are working out now we are having a programme in one place, Canojaharie they call it.  I am just sitting there, I'm doing nothing, but everything is working out.  Everything.  There was not even a single roof there.  Every thing has worked out.  People have come all over the world to America.  They are so concerned about America because always I said I don't know what's wrong with America.  Sahaja Yoga, it doesn't work.  You see, I told them don't go after this guru, he's not all right, don't go after that person.  They think like, why should I say such a thing?  Now all of those gurus have made a big money big, big money.  Some of them have died, some have run away, some are in the courts, all this.  But they don't like.  But I am not a newspaper person that I'll go on praising everybody or criticizing anybody.  What I am trying to tell you, the truth is that you better find yourself.  You better know your value.  You better know that God has made you for a special purpose and these are the special times that they call as Last Judgment.  This is the time you have to judge, and you will be judged.  You will be judged if you are in the spiritual life.  If you are not, forget it.  It's like that.  It's so simple.  You have to know yourself and get rid of all your nonsensical ideas, also all these artificial problems.  I hope I have been able to talk to you nicely, but as I told you that it will not [??] and now have love and compassion.

But it is not mixed up with something perverted.  It's not mixed up with something which is very localised or maybe something like a love affair and all that, it's nothing.  It is not also any identification.  Although I am an Indian or you are an American or you are something else, it makes no difference at all.  We are all human beings and that's what we realise within ourselves, that it's not true.  These are all, God made these lands not to create problems, but to love each other.  This is very important today, as you can see, for the emancipation of the world, for the emancipation of human beings.  And to give them love, joy, which is their right.  So Sahaja Yoga is, Sahaja means Saha, born with you.  Saha is with, Ja means born.  Born with you is this.  I should say the right is a very, very, very fundamental right.  That you get your Realization, this yoga, union with the Divine.  This is your right to get it.  Everybody has this right to get it.  And then you will realise what have you got.  Before that you are still on a level which is not subtle.  So I would request you to take to this Realization and also ask Me questions.  If you want you can ask Me questions.

Question 1: [??]

Shri Mataji: You see what I was saying, in a way he is both.  So you see the hospital now we have in India.  I started this hospital long, long time back, and you see actually with got eight doctors, nine doctors and he's a realised soul.  He got Realization and they cure the mind, they cured this man by surgery [??] And so this hospital is there and we don't charge for medicine, for treatment, for anything, but for stay.  That is only for one bed 300 rupees, 10 dollars for 1 day, 10 dollars, 8 dollars I am sorry.  And for the room, is air conditioned, and the bathroom, but for the room only we charge 1000 rupees, that's all.  But otherwise for the doctors, for the nurses, for the services, for the treatment, we don't.  Because this treatment is not done with medicines.  You know, the Indian medicines are so dangerous, you take one medicine God knows what reaction you will get.  You go to another doctor, you have to end up picking out of your teeth, eye, ears everything.  So, it's not like that.  It is only we work on the chakras, on the centers, as we have shown.  On the centers, what is the center?  Every person has different centers problem.  Then we see if they're suffering by over activity or by, we can say, inactivity.  There are two types of patients.  One are over active and some are possessed by inactivity.  So these two type of people actually are there because of the two sympathetic nervous systems.  Now of course doctors have started accepting, when I was studying they did not know that the left sympathetic was different and the right was different.  Still they don't know anything about parasympathetic, I must tell you very frankly, the parasympathetic we'll only know through Sahaja Yoga.  It's very simple, it's very, very simple.

Q2:  Where is this hospital?

Shri Mataji: It is very near Bombay, called as New Bombay.  And so many people have been there, have been cured and they have been helped.  I don't keep the list of that but I am really amazed how people are coming in.  They find it very cheap, you see, the whole place also.  And looked after with love, with compassion, with love, that's the main thing.

Q3:  My first question was how does one get the Realization?

Shri Mataji: That we will try just now, all right, after questions.  It's spontaneous, you don't have to do anything, very spontaneous.  You all look so loving, you all can get it.  Any other questions?

Q4:  Why do think that Americans seem to be more resistant to getting their Realization?

Shri Mataji: I think they are very great.  I think they are sitting there on top of the world already.  You have to come down. [??]  Even in India somebody gets lots of money, he floats in the air.  You just can't talk to that person.  Very common, money goes into head, this money orientation.  Also power goes into head.  You see immediately they sit on the horse, all these things, that's why this head is to be crossed over.  It's important.

Q5:  People who are suffering from poverty, violence, crime, drugs, what is the best way to reach them?

Shri Mataji: You see for poverty they are working it out.  Poverty, there are ways of doing it.  And also now, for example, in India I have started a big school for children who failed in the eighth class.  To give them vocational training, in India we don't we have. We have generous people, no doubt, but we don't need money just now we are we are all right.   These children are taken from about, say, they are from fourteen to sixteen years of age, who have failed in life so far.  So we teach them.  Like we don't have plumbers in India, here also if you call a plumber you'd better find out [??].  So in the same way we have problems of that and also, see for example, carpentry.  Indians used to do all the carpentry with their hands, you see, but because of machinery that trade is gone now.  So we have people who have to learn now, how to do it with their machinery, if you give them machinery.  So we are going to teach them carpentry.  Driving, we can't get drivers there very well.  They are not very highly paid people in any way, but I think they'll be paid something.  And other crafts like that.  And another thing is that we should see, like what we are doing in India is we have to find out what the poor people make.  For example, My father was a lawyer he used to go to a very far fetched village, called [??], and there I found very, very, very poor people.  They had no houses, they used to live in the trees, because there were animals and things you see.  And also they used to wear only one cloth, ladies would wear two above.  Cloth, only cloth they used to cover themselves.  And very poor, in that time of year, I really felt like crying for them.  So now I decided that I'll start export business but can you imagine Me doing business.  I can't even count receipts.  But I started the business, so called, and the first thing I started was, I asked My brother to go see in that village what sort of people are there, if they still making the terracotta.  Very creative.  He said they are still there, but some of them are Greeks, you know, when Alexander came to our country they stayed and they are there.  And what they are making, they call it bell metal.  No one makes this in the whole world that sort of a thing.  I said all right, we have exported now to America also, last in America, because America you don't know what they would like but somebody has dared to ask for it so I said all right, I'll send.

So that's also getting exported to America and it's working out well, she said it's working out very well here.  Because poor people are very creative, they are very creative people.  And they should not be given alms, it's a wrong idea.  Because if you give them alms, for example we have so many developments coming from these UN and all that, they will go in a well, they will build a well.  All right, then what happens so much money inflation comes in they take to drinking, this, that and also that well is not looked after.  But make them make a well, they should try to make a well themselves, see what is the problem so they'll look after this well.  See that is how we have started the village, we can do it, and the village craft in India is tremendous.  But they don't know how to export, you know.  What they are exporting is vans or motorcycles or something.  You see what we have in the villages is well made.  Now here you go anywhere and they say this is handmade.  To us what is handmade?  To us everything is handmade only.  But they say this handmade, this is handmade.  First I used to be shocked, because handmade things [??] I wouldn't make others buy it.  And you know, these handmade things we have such a wealth in the poorest of poorest countries you see.  [??] what embroidery.  You have to just guide them, tell them what to do.  You know, unless and until you have that love for them, you cannot [??].  Also, if they don't know anything you tell them that you make this very well.

Now for information, most of your things are coming from such developing countries.  For example, shirts that you wear, made in USA, are made in Turkey.  Then in Tunisia they make very beautiful things which are branded by French, see like that, leather things.  So now they are exploiting also, trying to exploit, Indian labour also.  So exploit Indian labour and exploit their own people and make money.  It's a trick of the trade, do like that.  But if you can really get it from these people, poor people what they make.  Put them to something which they can do and if you can manage them they'll they have their self respect.  Really, despite everything I was saying, Indian poor people have very great respect.  Very respectful.  They won't give you anything cheap.  Now supposing you buy from them something like this thing, this is just clay, they'll say, "This is just clay, just out Indian soil, why are you buying?"  Like that they talk.  I said, "No, it is very valuable, you have no idea."  So then they will sell you, other than that they don't want to sell you anything.  They are starving, they have nothing, they are very wonderful people.  But if you torture them and say you're poor, you're poor and all that and how you treat them, they can't even create.  Then they think what's in their hands and [??].  

Like that, you see, I felt too much for Indian industry.  Especially they are Muslim, most of them are Muslim women, and for them I've started a residence for them.  Now they can do a lot of work, I was amazed, how they can stitch beautiful clothes for children, with beautiful embroidery, you know.  They have a heart, all of them have a heart, and also they want to do now gardening.  They want to do gardening, they want to create flowers.  Flowers are expensive now and we thought that you can export flowers.  So like that, there are so many things they make, they are so creative.  Now here you get, I don't know what you call this patchwork, patchwork?  Now in India, nobody will wear the patchwork because it's regarded as something cheapish.  Because all these villager women, they make it so beautifully and I saw them selling here in New York.

Q6:  (Asking Mother's opinion about the equality of women in India, and women's rights.)

Shri Mataji: No, you see, our style and culture is different, what I'm saying.  The thing is that a woman is regarded, I mean not nowadays of course because it's different, but most of the women in the villages are regarded as Sakshat Lakshmi.   Which means Mother Goddess of wealth.  So she is to be respected.  All the people will respect, nobody dare insult.  That was our society and is still in the villages.  And the women feel very proud that they are housewives.  They are proud because we are housewives, we have our children, we can look after our children, we can cook.  They are great cooks also.  So you see, what happens, that they know that their area is their household, but they don't feel suffocated.  They don't feel they are lower down.  Like even My husband was here, he'll tell you about Me.  That first thing is I'm a very good housewife.  First of all, I know very good cooking, everything.  You know to please men you must know how to cook.  Of course, it's a fact.  And women should not feel low about it.  They are praised so much, you see, I was surprised because one gentleman, My husband you know was the foreign, he was the secretary general of the Maritime International Organisation and all that.  It was a very international thing you know, very formal and all that, but all his friends used to come to My house to have chicken made by Me.  Can you imagine?  Such big, big Johnnys, you know, and they used to come down for that.  And I was known all over the world for that, making good chicken.  But My husband knows all the list of things I make very well.  

So you see it is something, the woman must know her own value.  I don't like to work with men all the time fighting, quarrelling, reacting, it's money stuff.  And I love My own house, My own home.  I have two daughters and four grandchildren and now two great grandchildren.  And we are all very happily living, enjoying each other, because of love.  You see this competition is because of money.  Men have the money so men dominate for money.  Maybe in India also they might dominate a little bit.  But women know how to dominate because we know how to cook.  That's it, women must know their own powers, then they will not try for the immense powers of work.  What are their powers?  Stupid.  I would hate to have so many bosses, so many this thing, only one boss you have to please, that's all.  Very simple life.  But we should accept our own lives, we should be proud of it and that really gives you the family life and everything.  It's the woman who is the preserver of the society.  This we don't realise.  Woman is the preserver of the society and she understands she is the preserver, then you can bring round all the men.  Because she is the one who preserves the family, without the family what will men do?  They'll commit suicides.  

So you must just pour love in the whole family, in the whole atmosphere, how to manage, and you should be very patient and loving.  I mean, I tell you all My in-laws are at least a hundred in-laws I have, My husband's family.  They will come to see Me, not him. He is sitting here, I am telling you.  They will come all the way to see Me, but not him.  Because he was a big man, a formal this, that, and some of them used to just run away if I was not in the house.  So for what we should work?  What do we get, this money?  Then the woman now wants to become slavish people, very slavish, because they have to please the boss, please this thing, they have to dress up, they have to look nice, they have to look young.  I know all sorts of things, you know, so many enterprises have started this.  But here you don't care for honesty.  If you are a woman in the house you can manage everything very well, and if the husband tries to trouble you all the family will be after him.  Like that you know, it's a very safe, it's very safe and very enjoying and very good.  It's all pervading in the society, also, everywhere.  

But these days, people are getting so perverted in a way.  I'll tell you one example.  One lady she was the boss, she was the wife of a very big boss from India.  So she came, they were to come for a dinner.  And in the dinner, you know, they keep places for people with their names, labels, everything.  So she was not there, she was missing.  She was very smart, very smart.  For an Indian she was overly smart, wearing a very short thing, wearing her [??] and all that, her high heels like that.  (Mother shows height with her hands.)  But you know, I was surprised she was not there, everybody was waiting for her.  I mean, all this great formal dinner.  So I said, "All right, I'll go there," then in the waiting room she was sitting there. I said "What are you doing here?" "They made me sit here."  I said, "They made you sit here, I can't understand."  So I asked the manager, "Why did you make them sit there?"  They said, "We thought she is his secretary, we never thought that's his wife."  So the dignity of the wife, if you give up, you are no one.  One must understand, the women must understand how false it is.

In India they are called Shakti, they are called as power.  But you must know how to handle your husband, to handle your family with you and you have to bear a little bit.  Of course you have to be patient, you have to bear a little bit, must you must know that they are all not yet [??].  This struggle that we have here now I find, or in other places, European places, also women, is absolutely not necessary.  We have to change the society.  Now in Sahaja yoga people get married, there are international marriages of, 99% marriages are there.  One percent might not be.  One person might be because we marry a Russian with an American, American with an Indian, so it's quite a change and quite a different thing.  So can you imagine, how these people have become 99% people who are married.  In Sahaja Yoga, are wonderful, and they have very beautiful children.  What are their lives?
(Points to the audience.)  Yes Ma'am.  In any other sphere you are working you can ask the question.

Q7:  [??]

Shri Mataji: I would like to give you Realization.  That is what they are saying, that you give them Realization and I will.  Is a better idea.  He says that tomorrow we are going to have a very big programme.  But the hall is small, I must say, it doesn't matter.  It's such a big city, everything seems to be smaller and smaller.  All right, so for that, if you want your Realization, it's your freedom is respected, you have to ask for it.  I cannot force you, you cannot force it.  And if you want to go away, you can go away, it's completely.  Because if you have to have the ultimate freedom, this freedom has to be this way.  And this freedom is that, if you want you can have it, if you don't want then don't have it.  So they are saying that you all are invited to that program. Where are we having? 

(Speaker: "Town Hall, tomorrow at the Town Hall, at 7.30.  It will be a wonderful program where you will have your Self-Realization. That's on 43rd St. I think everyone must know where Town Hall is" (directions))

Shri Mataji: But I must tell you one thing.  You don't have to pay, you don't have to stand on your heads, nothing you have to do.  You just sit on your seats, or on the ground, doesn't matter.  That's the way of that because I told you, "It's your fundamental right."

Speaker vote of thanks.
