耶誕崇拜

印度普尼‧1986年12月25日

今天,我們都期待慶祝主耶穌基督的降生。這個地方有很重要的象徵性意義,這裡有耶穌出生時的小屋,風從四方八面吹進來,因此屋內很難保持溫暖。若祂不在十二月出生這個說法是正確的,祂出生在溫暖的月份,不那麽冷,或許不是你知道的那樣,或許今天的氣候是頗重要,祂必定也感到這種氣候。對你們而言,這種氣候,這種環境,這種簡樸的生活,你不感到任何不舒適。祂從沒有感到不舒適,祂的母親也沒有。

當我們的注意力在靈上,就不會感到大自然或世俗的事物為我們帶來的不舒適。當霎哈嘉瑜伽士開始投诉不舒適,就是他仍未是霎哈嘉瑜伽士的第一個徵兆。首先,我們要完全適應這種氣候,享受這種風格,享受這個速度,享受它用這種途徑打造我們。大自然與我們的肉體並無衝突,因為靈是同步的裝置,它幫助你與大自然合一,享受大自然最精彩的部分。你享受大自然,就顯示你是偉大的瑜伽士,這是歸功於我,我想,你們都已經視不舒適為享受。

基督的降臨是件大事,就如我曾經告訴你,是為了建立額輪。祂出生在地球的時間比祂的意識出生早得多,這個絶對的意識以耶穌基督的形相出生。只有你是有自覺的靈才能解釋祂的一生,不然你不能解釋基督 — 祂是誰,祂如何成就事情— 你也知道,很多事情仍很難在霎哈嘉瑜伽中解釋,你只是不停的看到事情發生。今天,你看到湖中有噴泉湧出,沒有人能解釋為何會這樣,即使工程師也解釋不了,沒有人能解釋為何會這樣,它就是發生了,水受激發,感受到上天,就開始活潑地傾瀉它的愛,你能想像即使水也能感覺到它嗎?

你曾經看過光怎樣能感覺到它,同樣,每一種元素都能感覺到它。這些元素全都在你內裡,我們可以說,最高的要算是光,因為光有效用,它受耶穌基督管理。光有效用,光顯示正確的事物,亦是它令我們明白世俗事物的不同面向角度,最終,光來自靈,靈開悟了光,你開始看到事物的不同角度,這樣有時會令你發笑,有時會令你微笑,有時也會令你哭泣。你透過霎哈嘉瑜伽已經成就了這個漂亮的面向,全在你內在建構好,你要達致它。另一方面,人們要努力工作,就如耶穌基督出生在小馬槽裡,這顯示神聖不需要出生在皇族,可以出生在馬槽裡,也可以出生在任何地方,對神聖而言,這是毫無分別的。

但這樣卻令人有很可笑的想法,他們說..我們要令自己悲慘不快,我們要把擁有的一切都捐棄給神。神不需要這些,祂亦不能擁有這些,你不能給予什麽。你要成為貧民,把一切都捐棄給神是錯誤的想法。神不要這些,祂只要你快樂、喜樂、享受,這些才是重點。還有是若你給少許,給神少許,祂會以百倍回報。這就是為何你只要給神少許物品。你不用把自己掛在樹上來證明你想犧牲。基督已經為我們做了一切,這是祂一生漂亮之處,就是從祂出生開始,祂已經向人展示,祂享受沒有物質的舒適 — 我們稱為的物質。祂從未享受過我們所知的世俗事物,這只是說明,祂為我們這樣做,是讓我們明白,不用追求世俗的事物 — 它們會追求我們。你不用擔憂這些事,你只要擔憂你的靈,靈是最重要的。

我要說,祂的生命很短暫,祂都在嘗試,祂對評價人很感興趣,因為祂不知道這些人類是什麽,對人類而言,祂是外來的,所以祂想作出評估。在評估中,祂說了很多了不起的事情,我們要明白祂的話,其一是祂說不要把珍珠抛給不想明白你的人。對霎哈嘉瑜伽士而言,最重要是要明白,你不應向反神的人談霎哈嘉瑜伽。他或許是你的兄弟,或許是你的姊妹,或許是你的父親,或許是任何人,不用說服他們有關霎哈嘉瑜伽,因為他們不是你的親人。很多人只擔憂怎樣說服自己的丈夫,或兄弟,你完全不用說服他們,只要放棄他們就可以了。

祂告訴我們其中一件事情,我認為這件事很重要的,就是我們要寛恕,祂已經給了我們最了不起的武器,就是「寛恕」。寛恕是那麽實際。你只要寛恕,這個人就不再存在,他不再麻煩你,亦不再在你的注意力下,寛恕是最簡單不過,亦是我們能做到,最能解脫折磨我們的世俗事物或思維的方法。

祂的一生是靈性的故事,祂經歷各種混亂,各種折磨,靈能經歷的各種麻煩,這顯示沒有人能殺掉靈,就如博伽梵歌說..Nainam chidanti shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah, na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati marutah。不能殺掉它,它是永恆的生命。祂嘗試透過祂的一生來證明永恆,從開始到終結,祂顯示靈超越物質,沒有什麽能控制靈。祂為我們做的是很了不起的事情,就是為我們的靈創造很大的信心,毫無懷疑,祂已經證明了。我希望你們會明白,不會在一些細微鎖碎的事情上令我費心,亦令自己費心,這些事情都不重要。你們要要求一些重要的,永恆的,有價值的東西。我很高興你們喜歡這個地方,自得其樂,今天我們已經宣布很多配婚,在這短時間內發生了很多事情。

在聖誕節前夕,我祝福你們,希望你們有很快樂的聖誕和新年。

[Shri Mataji continues in Marathi for another 15 minutes]
[Translation from Marathi]

Today intentionally I have spoken in the English language. Since all Pune Sahaja Yogis know English, I do not have to explain further. On the Christmas day something has to be told to them about Christ. Therefore, I have spoken to them. Owing to our conditioning, we do not have much knowledge about of Christ, but it is not correct. It is no use following the past conditionings. These people have come from the Christianity religion but have learnt all about Divine incarnations that were born in this country and work they did here. In some respects, they are more knowledgeable than we are. So we should also learn about Christ, Mohammad, and other great Satgurus. The reason for you to have this knowledge is, when you become Gurus in the future and you are dedicated to the Brahma and you know what the Brahma is, this knowledge will enable you to talk to someone. Then you can clearly tell about each of them and correctly explain stories about them. Without you being knowledgeable about them, Sahaja Yoga cannot spread in the modern times. Sahaja Yoga’s advent is in modern times when all the people know about all. All people know about great personalities. Now that we are not in our individual ponds, but have come in the big ocean, all Sahaja Yogis should acquire information about all the peoples, about the people from all communities, about the people from all countries, about the people from all religions, and understand where they have gone wrong and where we have gone wrong. Only then can we become real Sahaja Yogis and Satgurus. A little study is necessary for that and I adivise you to do it sincerely.
My blessings to all.
We shall have today’s Puja with vocal music.
I have already told you that Radhaji, meaning Shri Mahalakshmi was Christ’s mother. Although She was Shri Mahalakshmi, She silently bore everything so that example that Christ was going to set up was absolutely without any flaw or shortcoming, which people would attribute to his mother. The way Mary, the form of Shri Mahalakshmi, bore everything, the way She sacrificed Her son, the way She witnessed Her son’s crucifixion, and the way She endured all these things. From Her example we should realize that we should give up our attachment to our children, like my son, my son and instead observe, “How much my son has progressed from the view point of Spirit, what he has gained in Spirit”.
All of us have become Sahaja Yogis and have gained a lot on coming in the Sahaja Yoga. So, now we should see, “What do we have which we can give to our children.” Only thing that we can give is the knowledge of Spirit. All should give that and all should receive it. I have purposely called you to this far away place, because I wanted you to see what hard work the people have to do for their living. You are troubled by small things. You are not ready to make even a little sacrifice. For everything you have to be cajoled to do this and that. With this nature, how will you become experts in Sahaja Yoga and how will you grow further? The people are not prepared for even a small sacrifice! This is not correct. I hear a lot about the Pune- Sahaja Yogis that they want everything for free and they never spare even a paisa. Unless you change your attitude how will other Puneits change? You are their examples; they will see and take you to be special people. And when they see you haggling for small amounts of money, they will think,” What is the use of practicing Sahaja Yoga? These people are also like us”!
Secondly, as I have repeatedly pointed out, feuds among brothers. It is a curse to us and I find it is there again. They quarrel over money. “Where has money gone? Why did they spend so much money? Why this, why that?” All disputes are over money. I am surprised. I am ready to do all for you but you want it free! One should have self- esteem. Shri Mataji has to spend on our food! It is not correct! Money can easily become available by saving small amounts through the year. These people spend money and I also spend, but it does not look good and is not in keeping with self-esteem.
If you go to any village, like I had been to Narayangaon on the other day, the people over there had cooked all food and kept it ready. They seated me and offered food. Nobody asked for money. Such was their hospitality. When guests come we have to keep our attention at them. I am astonished; even now Sahaja Yogis appear to be under the curse of quarrels amongst them. The people quarrel over small issues. This has happened about this and that has happened about that!
Suppose a leader is told that he is not thenceforth leader and another Sahaja Yogi is leader their feud starts. If a Sahaja Yogi is told that he has no vibrations and hence he should stop going to the collective he starts squabbles. In everything they are cantankerous. They fight in marriages. The people think that when there are quarrels at auspicious place like a marriage, there is nothing bad in quarreling. However, it is very bad. It is very bad in the eyes of God and it should not be done. Christ has used the words,” Murmuring souls” for such persons. They indulge in backbiting; speak against this person, that person in their absence. They also play one against the other. They are extremely mean. I call the city of Pune as the Punyapattanam. I say that all the Punya has been brought to this city and praise it and despite that this situation persists.
Next year all Sahaja Yogis should make vigorous efforts. Children of this place are wise. They collected money in which all have contributed. Then they gave the amount to me. I was so overjoyed to see them. How sweet they are! They are your children. Then what happens to the elders? Why do they behave the way they do? Let your hearts open a little bit in Sahaja Yoga! You have no burden of Sahaja Yoga. I do not take anything from you and do not want anything from you. On the other hand I have given you so much materially! Even if you see the material gifts that I have given you it is quite a lot. In spite of it, when I have to hear about such things, it makes me sad. So, please do not crucifix your Spirit again. Think that today is the day of your second birth and resolve to live with your hearts open and with your self- respect. Please remember that you have to keep your self-esteem.
Today’s auspicious day I have to tell this again since I cannot say when you and I shall meet again. So please take care in this respect. You should not behave this way, otherwise all will go down. On this day all should make vow that since Christ sacrificed his life and we have taken him as our elder brother, what we should do to be befitting to this relationship, how we should work it out. We have received so much in Sahaja Yoga. So what should we do in Sahaja Yoga?
I do not ask for money from you. But what shall I do if you do not want to pay for your own food and transport? On top of it you pick up quarrels. The next time it should not happen. The people told me that when they asked for money to foot the bills of your food and transport nobody came forward. If you are so poor that you cannot pay even Rs 40-45, you should not continue in Sahaja Yoga, since you will be a burden on us. We have not taken a contract to take care of beggars! If they are in such poor circumstances, they should not continue in Sahaja Yoga at all. Those who cannot afford even this much and want to have free food, we are not distributing free food! If these things are not corrected in time they are never stopped and keep comtinuing. Even your leaders are fed up and do not want it. That has brought the deficit. However, those people think that the leaders harass them and do not allow them to meet Shri Mataji. All these things should be dispensed with. “We are now united. So far we have not done anything for Sahaja Yoga.”I remember, during Gandhiji’s time, my mother gave away her bangles, bracelets, and whatever was available in the house. And today people cannot pay a few rupees! Is there so much financial distress? No , ther is not!
These people come here from faraway places. You also have assembled in the equal number. But you are not sharing the expenditure. Does it become of you? Pease tell all the Pune Sahaja Yogis that Shri Mataji has told every Pune Sahaja Yogi to do anything but come for the program. The people go to the Himalayas to have a glimpse of God. This is not the Himalayas and you did not have to walk so much as the people over there had to walk. All arrangements are in place. Yet the number who attended the Puja over there has not come here. The people here will come only if the program is in Pune and will not attend if held outside. The people who behave this way shall never improve their financial position. Now you should come to Ganapati Pule with appropriate preparations. A good number of you should come. It is not very expensive. I have made all the calculations. Contribution is essential minimum to meet the food requirements. It is just that and not more! You have to pay only once a year. You are not in such bad shape and can collect a small amount by saving a few rupees every month. If somebody is in such poor state we can bear his expenditure. However, if everybody takes this position nobody will go. This question never arises in villages. It is quite different there. It is only on moving to cities, starts, “ We want everything. We must watch movies every day. We must have bangles, we must have bracelets, and we must have armlets. Does not matter if we do not go to pay obeisance to God, or do not attend a Puja, but we must have all these.” Our attention is more with food, which we must have in plenty and of our choice too. Our attention is never on God. Find out why we do not progress. Today everybody should decide that we will save some money instead of squandering it away. These people have given up all, given up their habits and vices. So they have now plenty of money. Similarly, you all should shake off the slavery which you have accepted all these years and get fully deep in the kingdom of God.
I am sorry to tell you this today. But all the history comes back to me and I feel that if not corrected it will go on and on, Hence it has to be put end to. These things have to be stopped. Moreover, quarrels amongst you should completely finish. One against the other and the other against some other should never happen. All should unite and intermingle. Look at these people, who have come from fourteen countries have mingled and are staying together. Whereas here the people who have come; not from one country, not from one state, but from one city, cannot come together! It seems, we were born with battens in hands and we started fighting soon after the births! It is so bad in Pune. Of course, there are many beautiful things in Pune. A number of Sahaja Yogis, especially the young ones, are very beautiful. The girls are also very sweet. I appreciate them a lot. All are so loving! However, the old ones need to work little harder on themselves. So today, all should make a vow that we are Sahaja Yogis. We have joined the path of Sahaja Yoga and shall do whatever is necessary to progress on it. Should make a vow and God shall help all.
May God bless you.
