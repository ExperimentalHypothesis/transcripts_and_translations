1980-04-19 Public Program 4 in Paris: The Spiritual Evolution of Man

 is the spiritual evolution of man.
In My last three lectures I already explained about the residual force called as Kundalini that resides in the triangular bone here [points to the Chakra Chart]. This residual force gives us the second birth.
But, how did we become human beings don't [is not] known to us, we do not know why we became human beings. All the scientists must ask this question, 'Why did we become human beings? Is there any meaning to this human life? Or we are born just to eat our food, produce children, keep money for them, and then die?'
If you make any instrument, for example this instrument [mike], you always have a purpose behind it. I've read a very good book by a ... an ... gentleman, who was a French gentleman, whose name was [UNCLEA T Joan Noah], maybe I am not good at pronunciation, who wrote that, "It is impossible to produce a human being in this short time since the Earth seceded from the Sun." That means, if you use the 'law of chance' you cannot explain this fast movement of development of a small carbon atom into a human being in such a short time. According to him, there must be a juggler behind it to do this.
As I've told you before 	
Put your hands like this. Straight like that. Now ask them to close their eyes.
