The third day of Navaratri 1991, talk on October 10th :

"Yesterday, I told you about the way these all incarnations of the Guru principle came on this earth, and how they tried to establish Dharma, this valence among human beings.

As you know that in nature, whatever elements we have got, all these elements have got eight valences [in which, some] maximum is eight. So, it could be two, three, four, could be five, six, seven, eight. So whichever is... Say there are three valences, or two, then the two valences because they're less will combine with others. If they are more than four... Supposing they're five, so they've three places, so they'll attract others which are [?] just like this. And this goes on in such a way that the atoms are not aware of it. They don't know about it. Automatically it's happening. Like carbon has four valences, so it can take four or give four. That's how life started, with the carbon because it had more possibility of attracting elements to itself. But all the things that are dead are not aware of the divinity, about Dharma. Their Dharmas are built-in. So if you take, say oxygen, it will behave like oxygen. If you take hydrogen, it will behave like hydrogen. They don't change because they're not aware. They do not have awareness.

Then comes the animal stage where they have nine valences. These also, their Dharmas are determined by SadhaShiva. That's why He's called as Pashupati, means He's the Lord of all the animals. So a serpent will be a serpent. Tiger will be a tiger. It cannot be that a tiger can behave like a serpent, the serpent can behave like a tiger, or a wolf can behave like a bird. They all have built-in within themselves their Dharmas. Of course, they know that they can fly, they can see, they can smell, they can make out, they have got magnet within themselves, they have directions. Because how can the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia if they didn't have a sense of some direction? They have magnet within them and they know how to act according to the magnet. They have a sense, another sense which you can call, which we don't have. Say there are birds in Japan, when there's going to be an earthquake, they can hear, in away. And if these birds all disappear then you know that there's earthquake is [going on?].

Or else there are some birds, another kind, like, you know the Noah's ark, he said they go outside and ultimately he found out that there is, water has receded and the leaves have come, because it brought one leaf of [ Mother's looking for the name in English] So, this how, you see, but this can only be done by dove, any other, supposing you use a crow, they'll not do it. So all their Dharmas are built-in themselves and they are bound by those Dharmas. They have to be that. Then human beings were given the freedom so we are not bound by any Dharma. We can be cruel like Hitler or we could be like Christ or we could be like any animal.

So, but our natural source is the animal nature that we had first of all is to obey our Dharma[s], it's natural. Whatever within us is the Dharma [instilled? Insulted??], those ten Dharmas [?] basically we know that this is wrong, basically. Even small children know what is wrong and what is good. Then we have freedom, then we start talking to Adharma, start crossing our limits, going away from what we think right is and reach such a state where we start thinking that whatever we are doing is the right. That's why these Gurus came and [brought?] you your Dharma.

So the Dharma gives you the balance and gives you the height. Supposing you have some wheat (?) and you spread it, it spreads all over, there's no height, but you put it in a [--? bag], then it [?]. In the same way, when you have Dharma, you get the depth of your [cough in the audience!], you become a deeper personality. And from this Dharma, once you become dharmic, then only you start seeing that there's something beyond (?). But if you are adharmic, then you think this is best [?] good lifestyle, why give up this? And you go on gradually disappearing from human value system to sub-human value system. It can be an animal system, it can bedevil system, it can be a bhootish system, can be anything there's no end to it.

So there are many Dharmas built-in within us which are ten basically, ten Dharmas. And these ten Dharmas are like ten commandments within us. They are taught [told?] to us as commandments, but actually they are for our benevolence by which we develop our Dharma. But once you develop our Dharma in the centre then your Dharma expands to everything: the money, the power, your family, to your society, to your country, to the whole world. You start thinking [?]. What is my Dharma now, what should I do? Towards my children, towards my family, towards my village, towards my nation, towards this whole word... What is my Dharma?

Then when this Dharma starts extending the horizontal way, then you start looking at others, trying to find out what is their problem is? It is my Dharma to help this person, it is my Dharma to do this way, that way. Then you extend your family more and more and more, you become very generous, you become very righteous, you become very kind, you become very mild, all those things happen. But despite that, you are not yet a realized soul. So sometimes when you are nice and you find there's reaction outside, because you're nice people try to trouble you.

Then you think that it's not sufficient to be nice. It's not enough, you have to rise higher, and that's how a Mahalakshmi principle is born within you [?] of seeking. And modern times are the main thing [?] where so many people have got this principle within themselves, whether they are conscious of it or not, but they are. You never had so many seekers. It's a category, a special category of people you are that you are all seekers and that you've been seeking the Truth and that's all you are [?]. And once you're seeking the Truth then you try to understand that you have to seek something higher, but if you are not already dharmic, then while seeking there are problems, conflicts. Your mind also can fight with you, your liver can fight with you, anything can fight with you in your body.

Suppose you have spoiled your liver, then it will fight with you when you are rising. If there's something wrong with you, say your father's side, mother's side anything it will fight you. But still, if the urge is deep and intense, you can rise. Everybody has to rise. Whether you are a king or a queen or a servant or anything, everybody has to rise and everybody can rise. Bur everybody will not, this is the problem. Everybody will not rise, this is a big problem you have and that's why we shouldn't worry about those who do not want to rise. We should worry only about people who want to rise and who want to ascent.

So today, I've already told you about the incarnation of the Goddess in the heart, and this is what Navaratri is, where at the heart level She came and saved people from getting destroyed by the evil forces. But they were already dharmic, they were already bhaktas, they were already seeking of God of their Moksha, their [Kalyan ?]. They were not to be told all these things, they were already there. So She just saved them at that time and She came, again and again, to do that, nine times Her incarnations are regarded as the highest value. But then it didn't work out, because you save those people for what? They are still only under Dharma [?] How will they go beyond this, how Dharma will become just part and parcel of them? It should be Sahaj within them that they should be dharmic, as you are. I don't have to tell you don't drink, [?] you just don't do it.

So this problem: how to become dharmic without putting any effort like: morning take hundred and eight names, then the whole day you work out, you go to the Himalayas get there in that cold... Of course, you too have a little bit of that here! You should get little [immunity?]. This is nothing compared to what is the Himalayas, but still, a little bit of it [?] Then all these things you [?] They work very hard for it, but Goddess didn't tell them that you have to ascend, She just killed all the devils and She killed all the evil forces. And that's how (?) nine times She incarnated but it was very important.

So Navaratri is to pray to Her, to pay your tribute that She saved you from evil and She gave you a sense of security. So at the heart level, centre heart, there's a sense of security. When this sense of security is disturbed, then you catch on your centre heart. And at the centre heart only, in your childhood up to twelve years, on this sternum bone you develop what you call the antibodies which are the Ganas. They are the Ganas of the Goddess and the king of those Ganas is Ganapati, is Ganesha. So whenever you see something that you get a fright, the sternum starts pulsating in your childhood, but when you are grown up, it sends like a remote control the message to all those Ganas which go out of the sternum bone in the whole body and receive messages and then they prepare themselves to fight attacks. Attacks of negativity. Say there's cancer which is coming out, that is the kind of violence they fight. They try to fight all kinds of things. All the negativity they try to fight.

They have to fight the negativity of the left side, not the right side. The right side negativity, I think you have to fight yourself. Also people like Hanumana and other Angels, they try to show how stupid you are to be egoistical. Every time you try to have some Ego, they show you. And then they control your Ego, they try to show how you have fallen into the [ditch?] of Ego. But when it happens to you, then you start seeing your Ego, then you become guilty, but that's not the way. If you see your Ego then you have to separate yourself from that Ego. You say "Oh, I've been [?] alright, I'll put you right now. " [... What do you think of yourself ???] Put the Ego down with your Ego. [What do you think of yourself???] You're Mr so and so you behave like this? Alright, I'll beat you with shoes.

But one should never play into the hands of Ego, it's very dangerous. But sometimes I've seen people who are possessed also can become very egoistical because these bhoots make you... and then it's very dangerous, you never feel you're doing any [thing wrong?] Just start doing wrong [?], aggressing others, you never know what you're aggressing. But if you oppose also these bhoots they'll trouble your body, they'll give you pain. But if you accept, they'll trouble others. The person who has Ego never feels the pain himself. But others feel it and they know very difficult. [But he feels "I've not done anything wrong, how can people say I'm difficult"...???]

So this is how it's working out within us that we can see our Ego because now we have become the Spirit. So whatever we see as a window. Now we can see through the window what is outside. We can really [expell?] our Ego and our conditionings very nicely if we try to do it. So, at this stage, the Mahalakshmi principle started and the first incarnation of the Mahalakshmi, as you may know, has come as Sita, because of Maryada Purushotama. He was the one who was full of Maryadas. His wife, She came as the first incarnation of Mahalakshmi on this earth.

We have today a film on Ramayana, if you want, if you are not anyway sleepy we can see, and you can see how She behaved.

[Shri Mataji addresses a Belgian Sahaja yogi's personal problems]

Asking the Sahaja Yogi about previous gurus he answers rebirthing and "Sai Baba":

"- This Shirdi Sai Nath?
(an SY) - Fake Sai Baba.

This another fellow? He was one of the devils killed by the Goddess. He was Mahishasura. The whole song Mahishasura Mardini is on that."

The old black and white Ramayana video starts "Rama is going to the jungle, as you are around here... This is a very-very-very old picture, a very old one. You must have seen this. Very old."
