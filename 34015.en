The third day of Navaratri 1991, talk on October 10th, Cabella, (Italy)

Yesterday, I told you about the way these all incarnations of the Guru principle came on this earth, and how they tried to establish dharma, this valence among human beings.

As you know that in the nature, whatever elements we have got, all these elements have got eight valences in which, some maximum is eight. So, it could be two, three, four, could be five, six, seven, eight. So, whichever is -say there are three valences, or two. Then the two valences because they are less, they’ll combine with others. If they are more than four - supposing they are five, so they have three places. So, they’ll attract others which are the three, it’s like this. And this goes on in such a way that the atoms are not aware of it. They don’t know about it. Automatically it’s happening. Like carbon has four valences, so it can take four or give four. That’s how the life started, with the carbon because it had more possibility of attracting elements to itself. But all the things that are dead are not aware of the Divinity, about dharma. Their dharmas are built-in. So, if you take, say oxygen, it will behave like oxygen. If you take hydrogen, it will behave like hydrogen. They don’t change because they are not aware. They do not have awareness.

Then comes the animal stage where they have nine valences. These also, their dharmas are determined by Sadhashiva. That’s why He’s called as Pashupati. It means the Lord of all the animals. So, a serpent will be a serpent. Tiger will be a tiger. It cannot be that a tiger can behave like a serpent, the serpent can behave like a tiger, or a wolf can behave like a bird. They all have built-in, within themselves, their dharmas. Of course, they know that they can fly, they can see, they can smell, they can make out, they have got magnet within themselves, they have directions. Because how can the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia if they didn’t have a sense of some direction? They have magnet within them and they know how to act according to the magnet. They have a sense, another sense which you can call, which we don’t have. Say, there are birds in Japan, when there’s going to be an earthquake, they can hear, they know. And if these birds all disappear then you know that this earthquake is going on.Or else there are some birds, another kind, like, you know the Noah’s ark, he said they go outside and ultimately, he found out that there is- water has receded and the leaves have come. Because he brought one leaf of [Shri Mataji’s looking for the name in English]

So, this how, you see, but this can only be done by dove, any other, supposing you use a crow, they won’t do it. So, all their dharmas are built-in themselves and they are bound by those dharmas. They have to be that.

Then human beings were given the freedom. So, we are not bound by any dharma. We can be cruel like Hitler or we could be like Christ or we could be like any animal.So, but our natural source is the animal nature, that we had first of all, is to obey our dharma, it’s natural. Whatever within us is the dharma instilled, those ten dharmas we obey. Basically, we know that this is wrong, basically. Even small children know what is wrong and what is good. Then we have freedom. Then we start taking to adharma, start crossing our limits, going away from what we think right is and reach such a state where we start thinking that whatever we are doing is the right [thing].

That’s why these Gurus came and brought you your dharma. So, the dharma gives you the balance and gives you the height. Supposing you have some wheat and you spread it, it spreads all over, there’s no height. But you put it in a [inaudible] then it gets heights. In the same way, when you have dharma, you get the depth of your dharma [unsure], you become a deeper personality. And from this dharma, once you become dharmic, then only you start seeing that there’s something beyond you. But if you are adharmic, then you think, "This is best for me, good, nice lifestyle, why give up this?" And you go on gradually disappearing from human value system to sub-human value system. It can be animal system, it can be devil system, it can be "bhootish" system, can be any system, there’s no end to it.

So, there are many dharmas built-in within us which are ten basically, ten dharmas. And these ten dharmas are like Ten Commandments in the West. They are taught to us as commandments. But actually, they are for our benevolence by which we develop our dharma. But once you develop your dharma in the centre then your dharma expands to everything: the money, the power, your family, to your society, to your country, to the whole world. You start thinking, "It’s my dharma. What is my dharma now, what should I do? Towards my children, towards my family, towards my village, towards my nation, towards this whole word. What is my dharma?"

Then when this dharma starts extending, on the horizontal way, then you start looking at others, trying to find out what is their problem is? It is my dharma to help this person, it is my dharma to do this way, that way? Then you extend your family more and more and more, you become very generous, you become very righteous, you become very kind, you become very mild, all those things happen. But despite that, you are not yet a Realized soul. So, sometimes when you are nice and you find there’s reaction outside, because you are nice people try to trouble you, then you think that it’s not sufficient to be nice. It’s not enough, you have to rise higher. And that’s how a Mahalakshmi principle is born within you of seeking.

The modern times are the main things where so many people have got this principle within themselves, whether they are conscious of it or not, but they are. You never had so many seekers. It’s a category, a special category of people you are, that you are all seekers and that you’ve been seeking the truth and that’s how you are seekers. And once you’re seeking the truth, then you try to understand that you have to seek something higher. But if you are not already dharmic, then while seeking there are problems, conflicts. Your mind also can fight with you, your liver can fight with you, anything can fight with you in your body.

Supposing you have spoiled your liver, then it will fight with you when you are rising. If there’s something wrong with you, say, your father’s side, mother’s side anything, it will fight you. But still, if the urge is deep and intense, you can rise. Everybody has to rise. Whether you are a king or a queen or a servant or anything, everybody has to rise and everybody can rise. But everybody will not, this is the problem. Everybody will not rise; this is a big problem you have. And that’s why we shouldn’t worry about those who do not want to rise. We should worry only about people who want to rise and who want to ascent.

So today, I’ve already told you about the incarnation of the Goddess at the heart level. And this is what Navaratri is, where at the heart level She came and saved people from getting destroyed by the evil forces. But they were already dharmic, they were already bhaktas, they were already seeking of God of their "moksha", their "kalyan" [Realization]. They were not to be told all these things, they were already there. So, She just saved them at that time and She came, again and again, to do that. Nine times, her incarnations are regarded as the highest value.But then it didn’t work out, because you save those people for what? They are still only on the dharma level. How will they go beyond this? How dharma will become just part and parcel of them? It should be Sahaj within them that they should be dharmic, as you are. I don’t have to tell you don’t drink, don’t- you just don’t do it.So, this problem is: how to become dharmic without putting any effort. Like, morning take hundred and eight names, then you do this, and the whole day you work out, you go to the Himalayas, get there, you get cold - of course, you too have a little bit of that here![Laughter]You should get little immunity. This is nothing compared to what is Himalayas, but still, a little bit of its limbs. Then all these things people seek, they worked very hard for it within themselves. But Goddess didn’t tell them that you have to ascend. She just killed all the devils and She killed all the evil forces. And that’s what nine energies have been incarnated, [unsure] it was very important.So, Navaratri is to pray to Her, to pay your tribute that She saved you from evil and She gave you a sense of security. So, at the heart level, centre heart, there’s a sense of security. When this sense of security is disturbed, then you catch on your centre heart. And at the centre heart only, in your childhood, up to twelve years, on this sternum bone, you develop what you call the antibodies which are the Ganas. These are the Ganas of the Goddess and the king of those Ganas is Ganapati, is Ganesha. So, whenever you see something that you get a fright, the sternum starts pulsating in your childhood. But when you are grown up, it sends like a remote control the message to all those Ganas which go out of the sternum bone in the whole body and receive messages and then they prepare themselves to fight attacks. Attacks of negativity. Say there’s cancer which is coming out, that is the kind of a violence they fight. They try to fight all kinds of things. All the negativity they try to fight.

They have to fight the negativity of the left side, not the right side. The right-side negativity, I think you have to fight yourself. Also, people like Hanumana and other Angels, they try to show how stupid you are to be egoistical. Every time you try to have some ego, they show you. And then they control your ego, they try to show how you have fallen into the ditch of ego.

But when it happens to you, then you start seeing your ego, then you become guilty, but that’s not the way. If you see your ego then you have to separate yourself from that ego. You say, "Oh, so I’ve been beating you all right, I’ll put you right now." "What do you think of yourself?"Put the ego down with your ego. [Laughter] "What do you think of yourself?" "You’re Mr. so and so, you behave like this? All right, I’ll beat you with shoes."

But one should never play into the hands of ego, it’s very dangerous. But sometimes, I’ve seen people who are possessed also can become very egoistical because these bhoots make you [inaudible]. And then it’s very dangerous, you never feel you’re doing anything wrong. Just start doing wrong, you start aggressing others, you never know what you’re aggressing others. But if you oppose also these bhoots they’ll trouble your body; they’ll give you pain. But if you accept, they’ll trouble others. The person who has ego never feels the pain himself. But others feel it and they know it’s a very difficult person. But he feels, “I’ve not done anything wrong, how can people say I’m difficult”

So, this is how it’s working out within us that we can see our ego because now we have become the Spirit. So, whatever we see is like a window. Now we can see through the window what is outside. And we can really expel our ego and our conditionings very nicely if we try to do it.

So, at this stage, the Mahalakshmi principle started and the first incarnation of the Mahalakshmi, as you may know, has come as Sita, because of Maryada Purushotama. He was the one who was full of Maryadas. His wife, She came as the first incarnation of Mahalakshmi on this earth.Now, we have today a film on Ramayana, if you want, if you are not anyway sleepy, we can see, and you can see how She behaved.Shri Mataji [to a Belgian Sahaja Yogi:]You have some problem of the right heart, I think.Sahaja Yogi: Yes. What do you mean?Shri Mataji: How is your father?Sahaja Yogi: My father?Shri Mataji: All right?Sahaja Yogi: He cannot see with one eye.Another Sahaja Yogi: He cannot see from one eye, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: He can’t see.Another Sahaja Yogi: From one eye, he’s blocked.Shri Mataji: Which eye?Sahaja Yogi: The right eye.Shri Mataji: Right eye, he can’t see.Sahaja Yogi: Yes. He has drunk a lot.Shri Mataji: Right eye, he can’t see at all.Sahaja Yogi: Since t wo weeks, he cannot see with his right eye. It happened suddenly after sleep and he couldn’t see.Shri Mataji: Where is he?Sahaja Yogi: At home.

Shri Mataji: He has been to some guru or somebody?Sahaja Yogi: No, but he has drunk a lot.Another Sahaja Yogi: Drinking Shri Mataji. He was drinking much alcohol.Shri Mataji: Drinking.Sahaja Yogi: But I have been to a guru.Shri Mataji: You have been.Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: Which one?Sahaja Yogi: I have done rebirthing and I have been to “Sai Baba”:Shri Mataji: This Shirdi Sai Nath?Another Sahaja Yogi: Fake Sai Baba.Shri Mataji: It’s another fellow?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: He was one of the devils killed by the Goddess. And he was Mahishasura. The whole song, Mahishasura Mardini, is on that.” But your father must be having diabetes, I’m sure.Did he have diabetes?Sahaja Yogi: My girl-friend has diabetes.Shri Mataji: Who has?Sahaja Yogi: My girl-friend.Shri Mataji: She has.Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: He doesn’t have.Sahaja Yogi: It’s possible but as far as I know, not.Shri Mataji: Must have started also. Drinking too much, you see, spoils your liver completely and also can go to the Agnya, Swadishthana.

[The old black and white Ramayana video starts]Shri Mataji: You all can turn on.I don’t know what sort of a- Rama is going to the jungle.As you are around here. What is this? This you can take it out.

This is a very-very-very old picture, a very old one.You must have seen this one.

Very old.
