 (England)
I was into pretty terrible things like theosophy and all this sort of intellectual seeking, getting completely lost and very damaged. I'd come back to London after being out of the city for years. I was feeling very unhappy, very depressed, and quite unwell. I even took a day off work because I was so depressed, which I'd never done before in my life.

I was sharing a house with two or three other people, and one of them said, "I've seen this advertisement in the newspaper, it was in Time Out, for this Indian lady who was giving a talk at Caxton Hall." And I said, "Well, I'm not going into all that. I've just been so damaged. No way."

She went, and that night when she came back, I noticed she looked different. There was a little... she was vibrating. I thought, "Really? No. I'm not going."

Then she went again. I was actually very unwell by then, and I asked her, "Would you buy me some fruit on your way back from work?" She said, "Okay, I'll do that, but I'm going to Caxton Hall, so I'll be back a bit later." I said that was fine. She came in late in the evening and gave me some grapes. I ate one, and it was so alive, so sparkling. I began to feel better. It was tingling with life and vitality.

I just... I called her. I said, "Where did you get these grapes?" She said, "Well, I bought them in the market, but this Indian lady at Caxton Hall gave me a lemon, and I put it in the same bag as the grapes." Obviously, they were vibrated.

So, the next time, I went with her. I objected, but she just said, "I know I have to take you to see this lady. You'd just better come." So I did. In those days, Shri Mataji would come down from the stage to see each person individually. When She came to me, my flatmate was also there and said, "Oh, could you help my friend? She has some problems."

Shri Mataji looked straight at me and asked, "Where is your father? Where is your mother?" I explained that my father had died and that my mother hadn't spoken to me for some years for various reasons.

Then She worked on me, and I felt the most amazing rushâ€”an upward rush. And then, total silence and stillness. I can only say I felt that the weight of the whole world had been lifted from my shoulders. I couldn't even speak until the next day. I had to go home in silence, just with such inner excitement at this new state of awareness.

A few days later, She invited me to her house. She said to me, "You must write to your mother." I replied, "I've written to my mother, but she didn't answer." She said, "Just write to your mother." So I did.

My mother answered by return of post. She said, "Come and see me." And from then on, our relationship healed.

Thank you very much.
