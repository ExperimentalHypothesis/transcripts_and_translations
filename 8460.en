1979-02-23, Seminar at Ahamad Nagar: Kundalini Shakti and the Seven Chakras, Ahmednagar

The people of Ahmednagar sent us an invitation with lot of affection - we are all very grateful for that. And furthermore I feel Ahmednagar district to be very special. Because the work that began in Rahuri and which kept spreading – that made me realize that there was some special religious work that took place in this district in the past. Also, Maharashtra is a spiritual region. Hence a lot of saints have taken births over here and have done a lot of work. Finally, to  mention as we all know, Shri Sai Nath has done beautiful work in Ahmednagar district. All this preparation has been going since prehistoric times.

From an amoeba, the human grew to stage where he started to think about god. Why did he reach this stage from that of an amoeba? Why was so much effort put into him? Although he has reached the human stage, has he achieved his final perfection? The reason for which he has been brought from amoeba to this stage, does he know everything even after reaching this stage? The curiosity that he has about God, the yearning he has, the desire he has. Every Human being feels that there is a super power in this world – How did he know it and from where? He has written many books, worshiped saints and has also troubled them. So this human – there must be some special meaning to him. Nobody would have taken undue effort; at least God would not have wasted His efforts. For example if we build this instrument – we lay down its base, and then assemble all the parts – you will obviously ask “Mother, for whom you are making this? What is all this? Why are you making? What will it result into?”  All this needs to be built up in the beginning. These preparations have to be made. And once all the preparations are done and the instrument is plugged into the mains – only then it starts working. Same with the human – God has created the human with this purpose – he too is an instrument of God. Not only is that but such a beautiful instrument made by HIM that it understands what is God. For instance this (mic) does not understand even if I am speaking through it. Even he who created it does not understand it. But that awareness has been bestowed upon a human by god is not present in the mic. This awareness was bestowed upon the human by God.  And when that awareness is illuminated, enlightened, the human is able to know why god created him. And then the power of the divine starts gushing through him continuously. The manifestation of that power is your heartbeat. Now to say, it all looks very easy. What Mr Chavaan said is true.

This thing happens within a moment, just a moment. As they say in English, split of a second. The event has to happen easily. Because this is such an important event – this is the final of stage evolution. We breathe – if we start thinking and analyzing before each breath, half of the population will die. All the things that are within us – those are natural. Sahaja – ‘Saha’ meaning ‘with’, ‘ja’ meaning ‘born’. ‘Sahaj’ means that which is born with us or our birthright is that of yoga. So, at the end, what are we. It should take place, it has to happen. When I tell people that you don’t have to put too much effort towards it, they are surprised – “How can Mataji say such a thing?” But can we call the Almighty to us through our efforts? Say, if a drop thinks that it can call the entire ocean towards itself through its efforts – is it possible? The ocean needs to come forward to absorb that drop into itself. It is the same thing. If, we say that we will slog – we will stand on our heads or we will run from here to there – that won’t help you achieve god. These efforts won’t help you get to Him. But if you are settled, you are religious and are on the middle path (not in the extremes), not involved too much in something then in these people it should happen easily. Like a tree bears a fruit – initially it just gets one fruit when it is small. Then it gets a couple more. And then it finally blossoms and many flowers turn into fruits. Likewise, today we are in a very special time – this process had to happen in this Kaliyuga. It is already happening and will continue to happen. So why is there so much commotion about it, I have not been able to understand till date. It surprises me when people think why it is like this or why it is like that. Now, if tomorrow I tell you that there is a diamond here, will you think first or will you go running and get it. So all that you have gathered in your past lives can be achieved by Sahaja Yoga – if I say this then why there is so much discussion- Many an incarnations have come on this earth to prepare you completely for this event. They have made all the necessary preparations to make you ready for it. How this has been done is shown in here. So look at it so I can explain you.

All this body that you see on the outside, what is it surviving due to? If you ask doctors – what is a parasympathetic nervous system, they will say that it is an autonomous nervous system, meaning, it is self-driven. But who is this self? “That we don’t know.” At least they are honest about it – that they don’t know how it works. How is it functioning? That we don’t know. Now, once we eat our food, who digests it? This breathing – how does it go on continuously? Furthermore if you start running, the activity of your heart increases and it will start throbbing. That increase, you can achieve – but who accomplishes the task of bringing it back to normal? Who manages this process – if you ask the doctors, they will say - We cannot explain. It is beyond our science.” Also many people have experimented in psychology and proved that there is some power that is all pervading, it is ubiquitous. They call it the universal unconsciousness and this gives guidance to you through your dreams and in that, symbols are used to provide guidance. If a particular type of triangle appears in your dream, whether it is seen here or in Australia or in America, it has the same meaning. But the psychologists after reaching a state indicate that they cannot say anything more about it. “We can tell you how it looks on the outside but how it comes from within and how it works we cannot see. Our India is a very great country. We should be proud that it is really a great country. This is a land of Yoga. The people of this country never gave much importance to worldly or material things. They always thought of only questions such as - why did this human come in this world, how? From where? What is the meaning of his existence? And your ancestors have earned and discovered this knowledge through their meditation and hard work. The only difference is that it was not activated earlier and now it is happening through me.

Like you are seeing this electricity today. It has such a great history to it. After years of efforts, someone finally discovered the way to produce it. If that someone would have kept this discovery to himself or shared only with a select few people, would you have believed that that Edison was such a great person. Newton was a great person. Discovery found even in every physical thing should reach the common man. Similarly discovery made in spirituality should be made available to everyone otherwise no one will believe it. For that matter, they say that we became human beings from amoebas, and that is a fact. But then again, not all amoebas became humans, not all beings in water have turned into reptiles and neither have all reptiles progressed to a higher level. There is some selection taking place. And it is only due to that selection and consequent evolution that we have reached to human state. And if there is a state above this we need to reach there. If there is a state hinted at or described by many, there has to be some filtering and such filtering does happen. If 10 people come in Sahaja Yoga, then 2 out of them may not receive it. Now we were at Covalam, the government of India had held our program - I guess this is the first time the government of India has displayed any wisdom. They organized our program at Covalam. Reporters were present there. Now, we all know what kind of people these reporters are. Some of them are way too weird. As soon as they came they started demanding for alcohol – “Our fees are fixed - Give us a bottle of alcohol, else we will not come to your program” etc etc. When they started behaving thus, I told them that I don’t need any one of them to print anything for me. I told them to leave the venue that I didn’t want anything to do with them. They got offended by that and some of them wrote rubbish against Sahaja Yoga. But I had given realization to a few of them. So some of them wrote good things, some wrote bad. No matter what you write, the truth cannot be taken back – because the truth is standing on itself. So even if, due to your pettiness or due to some foolishness, you write some falsehood, still the truth remains truth. So, if 8 out of 10 people get their realization then this thing is really true and should happen as well. And you see the proof for this in many ways.

First, I will tell you about Kundalini and later, I will also tell you about how to validate its existence. Can everyone see this? (Mother is pointing to the chart). Now as you all are listening to me, all what I am saying is going into your mind, you hear that and it goes and settles in your subconscious. So this channel on the left is called the ‘Ida Nadi’. It is also called as the ‘Chandra Nadi’ (the moon channel). And in ‘Hatha Yoga’ it is called as the ‘Tha nadi’. It is that power of the Almighty which is responsible for our existence. It is the power of existence. And if you can agree, I’ll say that it is the power of Shiva. And it is called in Sanskrit as the power of Mahakali. Power of Mahakali. Now doctors will say that we don’t believe in the existence of Mahakali. Now, our Sanskrit language has been written thousands of years before English language came into existence, and discovery of these things was made thousands of years even before that - so the English are not yet qualified to analyze us. The Ida nadi that is on the left side, through this Ida nadi, our existence has begun. Our existence is dependent on it. And when there is no existence, we perish. So many times it is called as the power of destruction as well. Then, this power which is active on our right side (mother pointing to the chart), it rises up and then goes to your left. And this (Ida) goes up and then turns to your right. The power on our right side, through this energy on the right side, we manage our physical state, our physical activities and through this state we perform our mental activities as well. Means if we need to plan ahead, think ahead what we call as organizing something, we wish to do this properly such as ladies in the house plan to prepare papads or to prepare chutneys for tomorrow - etc. etc. thoughts like these what we call thinking of the future or planning – all of these take place through this power on the right side. Similarly the activity of our body, say we decide to go running tomorrow, the act of running or the movement of our body that too takes place through the lower side means the lower side is for that movement. We can call this as mental and physical existence, whatever it is or for whatever its utility is - is used for that purpose.  Now this energy in the center is called as the ‘Sushumna Nadi’ - this energy is flowing through Sushumna Nadi.  We have seen the operating power of God. This power of God operates through the Pingla Naadi on the right.  And the Sushumna Nadi in the centre is responsible for Evolution. Dharma is established in us due to this. Now, carbon has 4 valencies. If we have any chemistry professors amongst us, they know that everything is perfectly fitted in the periodic laws. It seems remarkable, even surprising, as who must have planned all of that – how each and every element has been perfectly placed. So as carbon has 4 valencies, or there is gold – it never gets tarnished. That is its Dharma. Likewise, the dharma of human also gets created by this Sushumna Nadi. First the Dharma gets created in this and then its evolution  takes place. The evolution takes place with changes in Dharma. – There is a difference between our Dharma and that of gold’s, between our Dharma and that of an animal. But, now that this human dharma has been created, what is the next stage? That is ‘Dharmateet’ (Beyond the dharma), ‘Gunateet’ (Beyond the gunas, characteristics that are associated with a human). Meaning, these 3 gunas that I’ve told you about – ‘Tamo guna’, ‘Rajo guna’ and ‘Satva guna’ - we go beyond all these 3 gunas as well after only after you take birth in the human race. The human has now reached a stage where he only needs to know the meaning of all this. He needs to be connected with the all-pervading power that has created him. And for that, there is this energy called Kundalini which is residing here (mother points to the chart) at the bottom. It resides there in three and half coils. Just like a tape in a tape recorder, it sits inside us and records everything about us – all our doings, our virtues, sins – everything. And not only from this lifetime but from all previous lives – the Kundalini has it all recorded in her. Thus, this Kundalini resides at the bottom over there (Mother points to the chart). Just like the sprout is contained within the seed – this sprout in human beings, your own mother - this Kundalini, takes birth along with you, through all your lives. She keeps witnessing everything about you and waits till the time you get your realization and are reborn.

In the past, only one or two people got their self-realization. We know quite a few such people.  We haven’t heard of an incident where a whole lot of people turned into saints or they got to understand God. People have the knowledge means we read Dnyaneshwari, we read Geeta, we did all that but very few people understand God. And that is the reason why there is so much misunderstanding. To tell you, if you want to practice any Dharma (religion) or spirituality, the first thing that needs to happen is your connection with your Atma. Surprisingly, people don’t even know such a small thing. If you don’t know your Atma, if you don’t connect with it, you can never understand anything about God. One should have eyes. I should have eyes to see this beautiful hall. Just like that – until the eyes of your atma open, you cannot form any relation with God. Hence all these so called religions that we see today are all messed up. There is a reason for that. The spurious(fake) people have taken advantage of it. They have taken us onto a completely different path. And it has come to a stage where the youth not only in our country but all countries have lost their faith in God. You might know of Algeria, many Muslim people stay over there. And Muslim people over there are blind followers of faith (fanatics).  Much more than us. And due to that fanaticism, their children – who became doctors, engineers, architects – they said that they don’t want any of this rubbish. “You spend  your time in all this, read Namaz five times a day, break your heads – or go to Kaba (highest religious place for Muslims), do whatever you want, but we are not getting into all this, enough of it” .

It was in such times that a young boy visited me in London and I gave him his realization. After realization, I explained him everything – Dharma means what, who is Prophet Mohammad, what is his role in our evolution. Then, who is Christ. Furthermore, – what is the meaning of all these incarnations such as Ram, Krishna. And when he went back, he gathered all his friends and told them that their idea about God was not true. There is God. There is an all-pervading power. The only problem was that they did not recognize their Atma, so they were wandering about like blind people. But one can get vision.  And then he gave realization to 500 other people. So, you can see, our Sahaja yoga has emerged right in time. When those people are leaving Dharma to embrace atheism, Sahaja Yoga is there right in the centre, where they will get an actual evidence of God. Now this Kundalini is right here – Dyaneshwara has also talked a lot about it. Similarly Markandeya Swami and Adi Shankaracharya have done the maximum amount of work on it. They have made it lucid and explained it all so beautifully. But I am surprised that no one reads the work of Shankaracharya. Not only this but I had been to Covalum and he belongs to Kerala, he spent his life in Kaladi village there – and I was surprised when people over there told me “we do not know who this Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya was, whom are you speaking about?” So much ignorance has come into people due to English education. What benefits English education has brought – you can see yourself in England. And all that which we have forgotten about ourselves – because we have become a secular state etc..- If  complete ignorance about Dharma(religion) is a sign of secular state then it has spread in us completely – The dharma in this country is so deep – has been developed after immense contemplation and

Each one of its attributes has been explained to such a detail, that we can rule this world on the basis of the truth of our religion. We can have a reign of love. And people of the whole world have developed a curiosity about our country. We know that thousands of people are coming with the notion that we must see what the truth of this country is. But we also have a lot of fraud people for them and these fraud people are looting them and they will never allow them to see the truth.

I happened to visit ‘Musalwadi’ (a village in Maharashtra, India) a couple of days ago. Our disciples from there started saying that it was only due to the Sahaja that they have been blessed with such harmony - “We visited India so many times but we were never able to speak to any ‘Indian’. If at all we spoke, it was with those Indians who live in a western style who speak English better than Cambridge and without tailcoat consider themselves as Britishers. We felt very disgusted by this country.” So today, the situation is such that, these foreigners are astonished – seeing your culture and your state of contemplation. Astonished.  And they don’t know whether to hold your feet or what. They are so surprised to see this carnival of love that – “we have forgotten everything.”  Due to their English education (upbringing) their love, the warmth in their hearts, devotion, and faith – what all they had has washed away. That shouldn’t happen to us. It is very sad that it has started to happen here. Before independence we were all connected to our culture.  But once we achieved our freedom we started running amuck. We felt like we could behave the way we want. It doesn’t work out that way – because if the human doesn’t achieve this state, will he be able to go back even to the animal stage - I am faced with that question. It is possible that he may go into the state of the rakshasa (demons). The next stage is to be a superhuman, so how will they go back to animal state? And even if they do go back, they might go to a state where they are neither a human nor an animal. This state of evolution has occurred in us completely.

So different stages have been made for this evolution, out of these the first chakra in the first stage that exists in us - the one indicated as a square - is called Muladhara Chakra. Muladhara Chakra. Now people have created a number of false notions about that chakra as well, in India there is there is no dearth of creativity. Any Tom, Dick and Harry from here think he can talk about spirituality. Because who is going to challenge them? There are no measures to validate the truth – are there? Any one can call himself a guru. Anyone can get up and start giving lectures and thousands of people sit down to listen. I don’t understand what this person yaps and what do people listen to and what is the benefit? What is his reality? Only one thing, count how much money you have and how much you have distributed. There is nothing beyond this. Now, this chakra that we call as the ‘Mooladhar’ chakra – on this chakra, the almighty has placed Shri Ganapati himself. Now whether Ganapati exists or doesn’t, whether he exists in the religious treatise. A doctor may keep Ganapati in his house but when I say that some diseases are cured merely by Ganapati ‘stavan’ (praise) he   will be utterly surprised. How can this happen?

The doctors know all of ‘materia medica’ (medicines). This Ganapati in the house cures some diseases – what does it mean when Mataji says this. Can this be considered as true – but yes, they get cured. But you should have that authority. What connection do you have with him? None whatsoever. If you keep his idol in a corner of your house, that doesn’t mean that you have worshipped him. Meaning merely mouthing some niceties does not mean worshipping Him.

Until you realize what Ganpati is and how to know HIM, until you get the right from the Almighty – till such time you will not know for what purpose, Ganapati has been placed inside us by the Almighty. Now this Ganapati is the symbol of purity. The almighty created only the purity and established Ganesha as its deity. You will be surprised looking at Kaliyuga today – no one will believe that the first thing god created on this earth was purity. After all, the Almighty is the Father, very merciful, the ocean of love and abode of compassion. His first thoughts were – “if I want my children to experience the ultimate joy, if I want to work that out, then I first need to establish the most beautiful quality in this universe.” And that’s why he established purity in this world. That purity has been established inside of us by Shri Ganesha on this ‘Mooladhaar’ chakra. Now to talk about Ganesha I will have to give a lecture and it is pretty long. So we will offer our respects to Him and move forward.

Now the chakra which resides above Mooladhaar is called the ‘Swadishthaan’ chakra that too has been placed by the Almighty inside of us. Now all the activities pertaining to creation that we do, work of art, thinking – the creative power that exists in this universe gets utilized by this chakra. Now, the Swadishthaan Chakra that  resides in us – due to it whatever work of art we do, or futuristic thinking or planning that we do etc – the burden of those tasks falls on this chakra. Meaning, we feel that we think with our brains. That is true. But even if we think with our brain, still the fat in that brain – where does that come from? That is created in our stomach here and properly supplied up to our brains by this Swadishthaan chakra. Now, he who thinks a lot, plans a lot is always in thoughts – such a person is very prone to suffer from diabetes. What is the reason? Because such a person puts a lot of strain on that chakra due to his thinking. And the other task this chakra has to do is to monitor the function of spleen, pancreas, kidney, uterus and the upper portion of the liver. If the chakra has to do this task on one hand and the other task as well, and if you load only one of these tasks on this chakra, then it creates imbalance resulting in the disease of diabetes.  A person from a village will never get diabetes. But those who live an easy life or those who live a sedentary lifestyle, those are very prone to get this disease – the reason for that is they are always thinking. Now instead of thinking and planning themselves, if they understand the planning of the almighty, then they don’t have to take that trouble upon themselves. First understand god. Meaning, his all-pervading power is doing all the planning by itself. If you abide by that planning then all your tasks will work out properly and beautifully. If instead you take it upon yourself then you will plan, evaluate alternatives and work out the solutions where there will always be obstacles. You can see for yourself, the state of our country due to the existing planning. So the human doesn’t do anything. Everything is taken care of by god – if I say this then people won’t believe me. But we don’t do even a single task resulting in new life. You will be surprised. Let me ask you – what kind of work do we do? See these inanimate stones, they  have been brought and fixed here, and the tiles have been laid out. A tree dies and you make artifacts out of it to put them in some gallery. And you say that we are great people. Can we do even a single living task? Can you even make a single seed sprout? Can we even create a single seed for that matter? So why boast - that we do this and we do that? You do nothing – all that you do is dead work. Now you pick this from here and put it there or vice versa, what special difference is it going to make? Just a waste of effort.

On the contrary, by doing all such things the human has become a slave to the material things. For instance, our people from overseas they suffer from an inconvenience sometimes as they are used to sitting on chairs, they are unable to sit on this ground. Now as they are used to chairs I say they should move around with me with chairs.  (Mother laughs), I don’t know how you are going to manage. Now once you avoid sitting on the floor then you acquire such habits. This materialism is so widespread that we are subservient to it. That does not mean you turn to ‘Sanyasa’ (become a hermit). You do not have to go to the other extreme.  The moment I say, people start talking about taking Sanyas. There is no need to take to Sanyas. - You should get properly married, it is an institution created by God himself, and you should take good care of your children. But you should lead a life of purity. In Sahaja Yoga arrangement has been made for people who are ordinary – common folks and who lead a simple life. We can’t give realization to Sanyasis. If someone comes as a sanyasi comes before us, we tell him to kindly put on normal clothes and meet us. Meaning, there is no need to walk around advertising yourself. The ‘Sanyas’ (the state of being a hermit) takes place inside us. To advertise in saffron robes and do some silly antics are signs of a monkey. Humans should not get addicted to such things, shouldn’t get involved into a such things – it is all very wrong. Likewise there are many gurus who wear such robes and try to show that they are some special people. Such people are to be kept outside the boundaries of the village. Sita has told in the Ramayana that any sanyasi who comes to our door needs to be kept outside the boundary of the village. On the boundary of the village for a day only and next day he should be made to leave. We are people with families; we are not associated with you. You are Sanyasis so go and sit in the forest, what is the need for you to come here? To live off of other people, this life of a parasite - there is no scope for this in Sahaja Yoga.  If any of you are Sanyasis, monks like these, then goodbye to you – we can’t do anything for you. If like ordinary people you get married, means bachelors also stand a chance, if you live a life like that, then Sahaja is for you. Because such a human gets into balance. If children are in the house, the parents are in the house – the human gets balance, he realizes his constraints, he acts in a sane manner. He who doesn’t have a mother, father, no one – who acts as if he has come from an orphanage, or who doesn’t even know what  constraints mean – how can we give Sahaja Yoga to such person? Because it is only due to limitations that a person gets bound and progresses. If you see, the plant follows the same principle. When the seed sprouts, it needs to be constrained, needs to be nurtured, needs to be looked after. Nowadays, the psychologists have started saying that where family system has broken, where the society is spoilt, the children from those societies turn rogue. And the widespread war in the world, so much of chaos – similarly the unhappiness that prevails in the people – at the root of all this is their broken homes. They have no mother, no father they are wandering like orphans. That is the reason for all this turmoil. This is what those psychologists have concluded.

Now the second chakra that we call the Swadishthan chakra, the residing deity on it is Bramhadeva and his power Saraswati. But the Kundalini is the power that of virgin Gauri. And we know how Gauri created Shri Ganesha and had placed him to guard her door. Now, from that act we should infer that this Ganesha is looking after the purity of Gauri. That is referred to as ‘Protocol’ in English. He is sitting right there observing it. He does not affect the ascent of the Kundalini. He is just sitting there lovingly caring for it. Now people make attacks on Ganesha. The chakra on which Ganesha is situated is responsible for the functioning of the pelvic plexus. Even though the Mooladhar chakra is in ‘sukshma’ (felt but not seen, subtle) form, its functioning is due to pelvic plexus. This pelvic plexus also manages the sex aspect of our lives. As a child is completely unaware about sex, so a child, who will forever be one – always innocent and pure, has been placed there  in the form of Ganesha. Now there are many dirty people. There is one in Pune as well. He teaches such filthy things – to raise the Kundalini one needs to indulge in carnal activities. It must be brought to his notice – he may still not get it. He does not have any mother or sisters. But this mother of yours, Kundalini, is being guarded by Ganesha who is sitting there - when we speak the language of raising Kundalini in this way, means we are implying to doing sin against our mother herself.  Every person from India has the utmost contempt and anger against such horrible acts. And there are many people in our country who do such things. And this tantric (false guru) has ruined our country with such filthy deeds. Any son who has come out of his mother’s womb and if she is alive and witnesses such things, she will never tolerate such filth. We need to understand this. All such sadhus (monks and false gurus), people doing filthy things and driving you away from a pure life are just amassing money and roaming around in cadilacs. They need to be dumped into the sea. Or should be sent abroad. We should not allow them to operate over here. But it is surprising to know that the Hindustani people and I have heard even some ministers go to such people.  I am surprised how can you even elect such people? In our country, if we do not understand what a mother stands for, then there will be nothing left of this country. It must be understood that mother is a very pure being and she has bestowed purity upon us. And those who talk such filth against her - you should be able to recognize how devastating and deadly they must be to our country.

Now, the chakra, above the Swadishthan – we call it the ‘Nabhi Chakra’. It is also known as the ‘Manipur’ chakra. And on this chakra, reside Lakshmi and Narayana. These deities establish dharma; establish dharma (religion) within us. The characteristics of Lakshmi that we know - When we think that this person has Lakshmi, he is wealthy. That is what we construe. But there is a sea of difference between Lakshmi and money. Money does not mean Lakshmi and vice versa. Even if one aspect of her represents wealth and prosperity, the form of Lakshmi is very different. I’ll tell you about Lakshmi in short, because to speak about all the chakras is going to take a long time. So you have seen Lakshmi, her two hands are positioned this way and , two hands are holding lotuses. Meaning, he who is a ‘Lakshmi-pati’(a wealthy person), his heart should be like a lotus. Pink – that is his heart should have warmth and love. Similarly there should be a lotus-like beauty to his household. In his heart, in his attire, in is demeanor – he should have that lotus-like beauty. Just as a bumble-bee with its prickly thorns is welcomed by the lotus. Even if its thorns are hurtful, the lotus encloses the bee with its petals, covers it and makes it fall asleep comfortably. This is what a Lakshmi-pati should do. But a typical ‘Lakshmi-pati’ is a highly irritable person. So instead of referring to him as ‘Lakshmi-pati’ it would be appropriate to refer to only as person with money. You don’t get to see the real ‘Lakshmi-patis’ these days. But in our times, when we were of your age and young, that time we have seen quite a few such people. You are quite unfortunate in that respect and hence you get to see only the mercenary people. But in our times we have come across such great personalities that we could actually call them ‘Lakshmi-patis’. Now, her third hand symbolizes giving. Such a person should always be generous. And finally, her last hand symbolizes refuge – If people need refuge they should be provided with shelter. Such a person should be called a ‘Lakshmi-pati’. Also, Lakshmi herself is in the form of a lady, a mother. This person should be like a mother. We have established this image of Lakshmi since several ages before, since eternity, in this country. So great is our country. Can these materialistic people ever grasp this idea of Lakshmi? These are people who enjoy worldly pleasures. Can they ever think about these things? These are people who are ready to slit others’ throats even for every penny. Do you think they will ever fathom these thoughts? It is only us who have received this inheritance. We are not to give away this inheritance. We should be proud of it. Even if we might be poor, we are rich in our hearts – that should always be kept in mind. A person does not become rich or poor with money or the lack of it – he should have a benevolent heart. Now, it so happened that my father was a very rich man, and so is my husband – but if you ask me, I can sleep in a hut - I can sleep anywhere, even on the roads. Because I am in the state of happiness – I don’t need anything. Such a person, who doesn’t need anything – he is the real king. And the one who is in need, who looks at others with jealousy – we can’t call him a king.

Lakshmi, a very important deity is on our Nabhi, and we should preserve this Lakshmi we should nurture this beauty in ourselves and people of our country continue to preserve this beauty. They know the importance of it. They are aware that only money is not everything. That, beyond it, lays the Dharma which is of a far greater value. To live with Dharma does not mean parroting the name of god in the temples. The meaning of being religious has been explained by a number of saints in this country. In this land of saints, a number of gurus have come and have spoken to great lengths about what dharma is – we can’t thank them enough. But we don’t follow any of what they have said. Out of all the gurus, there have been 10 important ones and they have come in this world multiple times – of these the prophet Mohammad is an incarnation of ‘Dattatreya’. After Mohammed sahib, Nanak who came on this earth was an incarnation of Dattatreya too, so was Janak. Likewise Adinath, who came before Mahavir, was also an incarnation of Dattatreya.

After this we were really lucky especially people from Ahmadnagar that Sainath who stayed in Shirdi (which is close to Ahmadnagar) he too is an incarnation of Dattatreya. So, it is the same element of the Guru, which reappears on this earth and they taught several things regarding the balance of Dharma. They didn’t talk much about giving realization as such. They did not work too much on giving knowledge on self enlightenment to people. The one thing he said – that all of them corroborate on – was not to consume alcohol. Either all those who drink will turn insane or people who write against drinking will become insane. So there is a scientific reason for not drinking alcohol. The other day I was telling a professor in Chemistry that there is a very scientific reason for not drinking alcohol.  Alcohol and Cancer fall in the same category. Meaning, Alcohol and Cancer have the same effect on the OH ion due to which the heat generated when you work cannot flow through your blood vessels. This is so because the OH ion of the water content in the blood vessels cannot absorb the heat – because it changes its behavior. And due to this there is an - accumulation of heat in the lever, in your stomach – accumulation of all sorts of heat takes place. To tell you, cancer can be cured only through Sahaja yoga and by no other way. And this we have achieved.

We had cured a cancer patient in London. His wife is a well-renowned doctor there. They have established a medical institution there and she has been asking to deliver lectures over there. Let see what happens one I go there. Now this lady had so much heat inside her that she emitted heat continuously. While London is so cold, she opened all the doors and she said that too much heat is emanating from her body and everyone around felt as if there was a heater in the room. Same is the case of a drunkard. A person who drinks too much also accumulates a tremendous amount of heat in his liver, and then it spreads to his kidneys. His veins keep getting hardened. Now, the gurus have told to not drink. Now if I just tell you to not drink – you will never listen. Instead you will stop coming here. A couple of days ago, I asked people to promise that they would no longer consume alcohol – and half of them got up and left.  I then said that just take the oath, I did not say that you will have to pay for that. But the moment I said this half the people got up and left. Now alcohol is such a harmful substance – would any mother ask of her child to destroy him? “It is like asking it (alcohol) to come and strike you”. Without alcohol you can walk alright on the road. Then why to drink? You waste your money and in addition you know how a drunkard behaves. Now we saw three accidents on our way here, and one where there was a drunk person rolling on the road. And this is something that we see every day. Yet, people tell me that the consumption has increased in India – that is something very surprising. So now, this alcohol, which is such a big enemy of ours – I don’t understand what wisdom we are exhibiting by giving it so much importance. But even then, we don’t ask anyone to give up alcohol in Sahaja Yoga. Just like what Mr. Chavan said “Mataji does not tell to give up anything”. That is true, we don’t tell anything, like you should give now or later. But after you get your realization you will leave it. Now, a lot of people from London have come here. We have such 300 people who have been initiated in London. , thousands of people have received their realization. But these 300 are special. Most of them were drunkards, used to take drugs as well – but they came out of it. How? It is like this – when you happen to know your atma, when the atma starts having vibrations, when you start getting joy from within – then you don’t think at all about such things. Automatically such things drop off. This pleasure is so unique that you cannot imagine anything better. So, drink such wine which will never fade off and once you drink it, you will forget everything else.

So, like I was saying, once this Lakshmi element gets awakened – a significant effect takes place that your economic situation gets better. This is astonishing. People are surprised – “What is Mataji saying! On one side is our economic condition and how will it become better? It is such that - The element of Lakshmi creates a blend, a combination – due to which your economic condition becomes better and stable.

Now, take for example – Our students who have come from there. Previously, they had nothing to begin with. They used to live like beggars. Now they are so rich, they have no dearth of money or anything. Earlier these people had no place to live, nothing. I asked them what is this style of living, how can you live like this. After they came to me, had their realization and immediately after that they had proper houses, decent life style, they have a radiogram this and that. I asked them from where you brought all this. Earlier you had no money even to feed yourself.  They said they have stopped drinking, half the money used to go there. Why do they they need dole, to go to the bars. It is not like you don’t have money to feed yourself. It does not matter if you just go the bar. But what happens is that your Lakshmi gets affected. The moment you take to the bottle - Lakshmi leaves you. Why don’t we ever erect any monuments of drunkards? They are not in a state so as to erect their statues. And that is why all gurus had prohibited such things as alcohol, tobacco etc. And this is extremely important – we don’t understand its gravity. It is of utmost importance to humans – because all these things go against the consciousness. The consciousness through which you have to know God, if something goes against this consciousness, you can imagine how bad and how harmful it could be.

Now the next chakra, the one above – is called the heart chakra, because it is situated in the heart, in between your lungs. And this is very important because the place of goddess ‘Jagadamba’ is on this chakra.. Whenever a person feels scared, he remembers his mother if he realizes that “your mother is the mother of the entire world, is extremely powerful, and come what may – she will save you from everything.” We have heard so much about Jagadamba – like how many demons (rakshasas) she has killed and what all she has done. Similarly, once she got very angry and started dancing the ‘Taandav Nritya’- the dance of destruction. And then Lord Shiva didn’t know what will happen next, what will happen when the Mother is angry. The moment her own child was placed under her feet, she placed her foot gently on it with a long outstretched tongue. We have read this in the scriptures and this story is true. We experience this in our life. When a person gets a sense of insecurity or when he feels insecure, when he feels like some calamity is going to befall him, something is going to happen – his heart starts palpitating. The reason for that is that this heart chakra gets confused. The power from that chakra is destroyed or it vanishes. The people especially those who are afraid of being possessed by demons(Bhoots), they feel like that someone or some negative forces will overpower them if they venture out, also go into this state. When this chakra is secure, when this chakra is enlightened, then the sense of security in the person increases.

Now, a lot of women suffer from breast cancer. People think that this cancer happens due to some different reasons, but it is pretty straight forward – If woman is feeling insecure she will develop the cancer of breasts. Likewise, many suffer from shortness of breath. We have identified many such breathing problems and cured many such people. The governor of Kashmir, Mr Sahay, Bhagwan Sahay Saheb, he was suffering from respiratory problem for almost 25 years. We cured that too within five minutes. If you establish this chakra with divine vibrations, that person feels better for all his life. Because the moment this chakra is established, Power of Jagdamba awakens in him and the feeling of insecurity goes away and he starts living a joyful and satisfied life.

The chakra above Hriday (Heart) chakra is Vishuddhi chakra. This is a very important chakra as well. Because it is due this chakra that a person has turned into a human from being an animal. He raised his head from a bowed down position to an upright one - it was at this point that he turned into a human being. And this neck is not to be bowed before anyone and certainly not before falsehood in any case. But if it is the Almighty, or someone who is worthy of reverence – the head should only be bowed down before such beings. We fall at the feet of every Tom, Dick and Harry – whether it is a ghost (bhoot) or an animal - we come down before everyone. There is no need to come down even at my feet. Unless you get the experience, you shouldn’t come down at my feet. I have witnessed two such incidents.

When I was in London, the people out there used to wonder ‘Why should I come at Mataji’s feet?’ Now what to do if my feet are the ones doing all the work. Now people were offended because they didn’t want to come at my feet – even after they had got their realization. And a few days back when I was talking at some village, I said enough of coming at my feet. So they felt sad that Mataji is not allowing them to venerate her. So you see, you get to see these two extremes in this world today. The point is – you need to realize in your prudence that the human is the most specially crafted animal, of the highest category. And that he is not to bow down his head before every one. Likewise this is the seat of Virata within us. The Virata encompasses everything – and similarly the Alighty is totally like us. We are all elementary cells of his being. These cells, that we are, have been built exactly like the Almighty.  When these cells get enlightened, they come to know the Virat (Almighty). So this is the place (Vishuddhi) through which you come to know about the Virat form of God. Now people who consume tobacco – I don’t know if Ahmednagar produces a lot of tobacco, but I see a pouch of tobacco dangling around everyone’s neck. Now I don’t understand how this tobacco has come into this Nagar district. Even the women use black tobacco- what is that - I don’t know where this type of tobacco came from. But because of this tobacco, this chakra is so badly affected due to which their children and even their children have developed coughing and breathing problems. But when told, no one listens. When they are asked to quit tobacco, they can’t. It is only when you come to Sahaja Yoga that you have to quit it, and there are very interesting experiences people narrate about kicking off this habit. There was this gentleman who used to do a lot of work in Sahaja Yoga and I was very fond of him. Even though he was very deep in Sahaja Yoga, he wasn’t able to give up his habit of consuming tobacco completely. He used to get the craving every once in a while. There was this one time when he had taken tobacco in my presence, thinking that I wouldn’t notice it. But I did.  I did not pay attention to him and thought let’s wait and watch.

Then he came up to me and said “Mataji, my face suddenly becomes as big as that of Hanuman sometimes. I feel as if it is bloating.  How is that happening? Is Sahaja Yoga turning me into Hanuman, I don’t understand?” So then I asked him “Do you consume tobacco?” “Yes Mataji”, he said and touched his ears apologetically.  So I told him that – Now you promise me. I will make you give it up. Just try a little.  – Because now that you have got your realization, you won’t really feel the need for it. He said “I have almost given it up”. I said” Whatever little is still remaining, just give it up and this Hanuman thing will go.”  And so, finally that gentleman gave up the tobacco habit. This way, Sahaja Yoga cures everything effortlessly. And the way the cures happen are hilarious as well - Everyone should witness them and enjoy the fun.

This Vishuddhi chakra – its importance cannot be over-emphasized. Because Sixteen thousand channels are dependent on this chakra. So you should understand that when you casually smoke that cigarette worth 2 pennies, you are basically destroying all those sixteen thousand channels. You have no idea as to how those channels have been tied up and where all and how they run through the system. In London, every doctor warns against smoking. Not only that, every cigarette pack has it written on it that it will kill you, you will get cancer, yet people smoke.( please sit down. Do you smoke? Why are you leaving, please sit down. Do not leave in the middle. People who smoke are leaving. I have not asked you to give it up right now. I understand quite well your compulsion).  Now that cigarette has turned into a huge cancer, yet people can’t give it up – I know that habit is a thing that you cannot give up easily. Only you need to understand it compassionately and after correcting your vibrations it will go off automatically. It is easily kicked off and once you leave all the habits, man enters such an environment that we can say he has entered the Almighty’s kingdom.

The position above that is that of the Agnya chakra. Now I have already told you before – all dharma (religions) are flowers from the same tree. Yet we keep fighting about it – this is my flower, this is your flower and so on. All nurtured by the same power. Many a time’s different people came on this earth to do this work. Like I said, ten different gurus came – similarly this chakra situated on our forehead, where we apply the red kumkum that is called as Agnya `Chakra. This is the position of Maha Vishnu.  Now who is this Maha Vishnu? If anyone has read Devi Mahatmya, they will come to know who he is. And its principle is that of Ganesha. Mahavishnu and Ganesha are two sides of the same coin. It was only once that Mahavishnu had taken an incarnation and that was in the form of Christ. Meaning, Christ is no one else but Mahavishnu. And if you read on Mahavishnu, you will be surprised that his descriptions, qualities, everything matches exactly to those of Christ. And Christ’s mother, Mary, was none other than Radha herself. Now it is described about Mahavishnu, that Radha herself created her son. And his father was Vishnu, hence he was named Christ. No one understood why Krishna was called Christ over there.  Krishna was coined after the word Krishi (Farming). Krishna practised farming (Krishi) and the  fruit of that is Christ. And it has also been described that Krishna has bestowed upon Christ his 16th right. Similarly Christ would become the support of the world and demonstrate people what Krishna had said:

nainam chindanti shastrani

nainam dahati pavakah

This he will show.

(The soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can it be burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.)

That this power can never be destroyed and will bring forth the upliftment of people. And this has been evidenced in his (Christ’s) resurrection. So you see, all these entities (Christ, Krishna...) are related to one another, yet we keep fighting amongst ourselves because we have not understood how they are related. Everybody understands this after realization. And after that, we understand how to make use of each individual. Because of this help, the all pervading power also helps us so much that whatever we have had learnt so far, whatever  petty ideas we have  – that we are Hindus, Christians etc all such petty feelings become  meaningless and then we truly transform into a global personality.

Now, the chakra on top of that is called Sahasrara Chakra. When the Kundalini pierces this chakra, when it passes through the bramharandhra (Fontanelle bone area), only then can it be said that the person has attained his self-realization. Christ has called it the baptism, Mohammad has called it ‘peer’ – it has been said in all the religions, that you need to be reborn.

You should transform into a ‘Dwij”. Now, there is a lot of confusion regarding this as well. Dwij does not mean only birth. Only when he is reborn we would call him as ‘Dwij”.  In India, for a person who is called Brahmin (Superior being), he can be employed or can be deployed for anything. Even though he does not possess “Bramhanatva (quality of a true Brahmin). Only by taking birth one does not begin a Brahmin. Only persons who are reborn are true Brahmins. From this point of view, we can call even Chokha Mela (Saint from a lower caste)  as a Brahmin and call many Brahmins as Kshudras (Lower caste people). This is the situation.

Recently we had a program in Pune in a Brahmin gathering. They came to know that Mataji is not a Brahmin. They said “We will not allow Mataji to conduct the program”. So do things accordingly. “Everybody knows about Mataji. And if you cancel the program, it will be in news that you are discriminating as Brahmins. If you rake such an issue, it will defame you.”

So they very reluctantly agreed - that as it is already decided, let’s do it now.  As it was already publicized, they somehow agreed to this. The organizers did not inform me about all these inner stories. I got up for the speech and casually asked “If there are any Brahmins here, please come in front of me. Should be true Brahmins”. So 3-4 of them really stood in front of me. They said” We are Brahmins”. I said” Oh, Is that right?  Then extend your hand towards me”.

They started trembling. I said,” What’s happening to you?”. They said, “Mataji, We are trembling because you are the Power”. I said,” I agree that I am the Power. But why are you trembling? Nobody else is, only these two are shaking.”

I said, “Ask them where they are from?” These were two persons from the Thane mental hospital. Now look at this. To have false pride about oneself. You cannot presume things about yourself. You need to become someone. It should happen in reality. And such spurious people, they have always tormented the saints. You know, how badly such people have caused misery to Dyaneshwara (A saint from Maharashtra, India). Then, Sai Nath (from Shirdi, Maharashtra, India). They have not spared anyone.

Not only that - when Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya went home when his mother died and he wanted to perform the final rituals, these people told him that,” you cannot perform as you are a sanyasi”. And nobody turned up for the final rituals. In Kaladi village he cut the tree and ignited the banana tree and performed the rituals. (And he cursed entire Kerala that you would perform the final rituals in front of your homes and bury the dead body there. Even today same thing is happening.)

So, likewise, such unauthorized people have insulted all the saints and monks. Not only in our country, but in most of the countries. Even during the times of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) the unauthorized people tortured and persecuted him immensely. If we describe that we get to know that when compared to Muhammad sahib and family, even Dyaneshwara was not tortured so much. They tried to destroy them totally. Even today, such people who harass the saints and in the positions of power, claiming that “we are saints, we are fine hermits and we are false ascetics” are roaming around. Do not pay any attention to such people.

There is a huge revolution taking place in Sahaja Yoga – as the true nature of religion has come to the fore, the dharma (religion) is getting completely established.  People are now realizing that the unnecessary intermediaries keep robbing them and they will no longer pay alms to them. Traditions which make fool of you are of no use. Traditions which make you wise, which take you to a higher level, which really enlighten you spiritually.-only those traditions should be considered genuine.

And you will be surprised – these fake people didn’t spare even a single saint, persecuted them all along although common people supported them.  Even Christ, he too was crucified by them. The common man could realize who the saints were – but the fake ones never acknowledged them. A lot of such people have anger against me as well. But my principles are different hence it will have no effect on me. A few days back same thing happened. A gentleman brought a lady to one of my programs. She was suffering from the disease of epilepsy. If there are such diseases, I tell them to inform me before hand before bringing them. People who are possessed start shaking in front of me. People with epilepsy start getting jerks. So she again suffered from a stroke of epilepsy. After this I asked them why they have brought her without telling me. If you would have told me, I would have paid attention to her. See now she has suffered from a stroke of epilepsy. This is disrupting the talk.

So he got up and started saying that ‘We are Brahmins and great people. We are priests at such and such temple. You saints and monks should serve us. And you should do this and that’. I said ‘Is that so. We should also get be beaten by shoes!!  Get out from here.’ Still they were not prepared to leave. I said’ Beware if you come here again. Every time the saints have been greatly persecuted. This will not be tolerated any more. Enough is enough.’ It is then they got up and left. This way not only the saints were persecuted but also had to face their arrogance, had to suffer their bullying. The saints must be persecuted. If we slap them twice they must be prepared to be slapped 10 times. Because we are very wise and have a better understanding of Dharma (religion).’ This way we have made the saints suffer from so much of injustice, so much injustice, yet the common people just kept on witnessing. They also opposed the persecution and were punished for that. But the common people have always recognized the saints and revered them. And hence all my work is meant only for all common people like you.

The chakra situated on the top is the Sahasrara chakra which has 1000 petals. Now doctors argue that these are 998 veins, two less 1000. I told them what great difference it makes if there are 998 or 1000. And just because of this silly issue they are turning their back to Sahaja Yoga. Now what to call such educated fools! And it was for this reason that I studied medicine – I knew I would have to deal with such so called educated people. We have with us two very wise doctors. One is a Russian. The other is a Parsi – he had been practicing in London for long time and is also a psychologist. So likewise we have a lot of educated and learned people with us here. They have studied each and every aspect of Sahaja Yoga in great detail. Not only that but they know what is the deity? What is the meaning of each deity? The moment I started teaching them Sahaja Yoga, they surprise me with their in depth analysis of the whole thing, they have sorted out each and everything. Whatever tapes those were prepared of my lectures and speeches - these people documented and classified the extracts from each and every lecture that I’ve been giving. Which cure is meant for what disease, this person is suffering from this disease? How to raise the Kundalini, what are the obstacles, where does it get blocked, roles of the deities etc.  They have studied everything in detail. What do your deities do? So now you have to learn all this from them – because we only learn from the English, isn’t it so? You don’t follow what Mataji teaches, right. So I have brought these people along with me!( Mataji laughs).

Now it is like this – we have such a great inheritance of our culture, we have been bestowed on with something great, and you are not even aware of it. And with such useless education methods I say - where you do not get to know what is true. What is all pervading power? There is no consideration for this; there is no exchange of thoughts on this.  If you follow such useless education system, if you start following western culture then one could say that – you are throwing way the beauty, the wealth and opulence that you already possess.

Now once you come on the Sahasrara and Kundalini pierces it, you get to experience the collective consciousness. Means you experience it and it’s not just an explanation by someone.  It is called as actualization in English. This is actual experience. Experience means this is the enlightenment in you.  The all pervading power of the Divine starts manifesting in you. The vibrations start flowing through your hands. Then, on your fingers, you start understanding which chakras are catching, yours or others. - Because once you are able to tap into your subtle system, you can tap into the subtle systems of others as well. As you can see on the chart, it is shown which finger indicates which chakra. What are the chakras on the left and right hand fingers how to heal and correct the chakras. Even a small child can tell you which chakra of yours is affected. Now I have 4 grandchildren and all of them are realized. Out of them the younger one is 2 and a 1⁄2 year old granddaughter. A couple of days ago, Patricia (a yogini) happened to visit her. She asked my granddaughter –“Anupama, which of my chakra is catching?”  She does not understand English so well still she responded – left Vishuddhi and Nabhi. She told her clearly. She is so small, just 2 and half years old but she could tell. Patricia asked me – Mataji, how did she know? “The thing is, that this is all subjective knowledge. All this understanding is from within. Now as we can feel the difference between hot and cold, similarly the children also understand. You just indicate the name (person), they will tell about the state of chakras.

Just before coming to Ahmednagar, we had been to this one other place. There a lady who was sitting in front of me. Her finger started shaking. I asked her ,”During delivery period, did you suffer a lot?” . She said, “Suffered a lot, this and that happened.” And that finger was shaking in front of me. And the chakra governed by this finger, controls the uterus. Means the right side of Swadishthan Chakra controls uterus.  When I said this, she said “Mataji, How did you know this?” But I can see everything clearly. If you all can get this realization, this power to know yourself can exist in each one of us and it should happen so. Once this happens, the collective consciousness gets manifested in you. This does not happen by just proclaiming that we are all brothers and sisters. All that exists in the universe is present in this body. All that you are, that is me. So, feelings such as that of doing charity are all useless. If one of our fingers gets affected (catch), and if I do this way, it can become alright. If you are a part and parcel of us and if we are correcting you – aren’t we correcting ourselves as well? How are we doing a favor to you then?

It is a condition that creates a state in you that you don’t have to tell that these are our brothers, you become connected. You feel this way. And you start wringing your hands. Many small children start putting their fingers in their mouth. Psychologist cannot explain why they do it – but we know. If they are realized children then it become evident as the chakra that is affected (by a catch) they will put those fingers in their mouth. Then they again change the fingers. There was an eleven month old girl. She could accurately depict the catches of different people as her fingers have a burning or pulling sensation. They start using their fingers for this. Now this science is so innovative and special – the science to know the divine is very vast.  We all need to know this power. It is already present inside of us – all we need to do is to awaken it. There have been many allegations against this.

There is one special thing I observe that people think that to awaken Kundalini is a very difficult process and while doing that we jump like frogs etc. etc.. There was this person who sat in front of me with both his legs in the air. People told him told him to not do that in my presence. He told them that let me sit this way only otherwise I will jump like a frog! They said why so? He said that his guruji (guru) had told him that people jump like frogs when their Kundalini is awakend. I asked him is that so? Then was he jumping? He said he used to jump. I said it seems you wish to convert me in a frog (Mataji laughs). Instead of converting into a super human if someone wants to convert into a frog and some others say that people roar like lions etc.. We have given realizations to thousands of people around the globe – Columbia, Chile, Argentina, China, Russia etc. – I have travelled across all these regions. Besides these - Iran, Italy, all the countries in the Mediterranean regions – I have travelled across all of them as well. And so, we have given realization to many people at these places – but nowhere did we come across people who started jumping like frogs. Everything went off quite well. Some people may or may not   have felt a little heat, but nobody suffered from any problem. Or we can say 99 out of hundred people, did not suffer from any problem. Sometimes only a light sensation of heat can be felt on the hand. Very light sensation.  And some people say that all this is very difficult. But if a difficult task can be accomplished easily by me, then I too have some special capabilities. This cannot happen without capabilities. And I am getting recognition because  it was difficult. Everyone must realize that some major task was to be accomplished and it was also destined to happen. That is why,” Instead of Mataji inventing, she knows something which she has brought for us. She loves us immensely and we have the right on her possession. That is why we are getting it and we must possess it because it is rightfully ours.”  If you take this position then you may suffer from the issues of ego because the ego goes into head. Especially for people in the city and as Ahmadnagar happens to be a city, I have to speak with caution. But it is not the same for people from villages. And our people from Mumbai are even more special. Because Mumbaikar’s (people from Mumbai) have a different mid set. Delhikar (people from Delhi) feel that they are superior to all. Since they are in power, they think in very different way.

But if they suffer from some disease then they come running to me. Our Honorable President sir was also suffering from cancer. That time I cured him in London. He knows this. He will not allow me to publish this in paper or allow me to tell others. He will not do anything since this is not an official matter. Likewise humans have lot many problems. Whatever it is, you should all realize that this belongs to our mother, to us and is our very own. One should not be very formal about this, it is very simple. Even if you come and sit on my head, it is all fine – because I am your mother, not your guru. But even then there has to be some respect. You should respect your mother and you should know this. If you get your realization with that sense of respect in your heart, you will be surprised to realize – that all that you had been searching for in the past lives, all the good that you’ve earned in those lives, it has all been manifested in you today. But even so, after realization humans need to work upon themselves. Because sometimes people who have been rescued and put on a boat still feel like they are drowning. And some of them collapse. So after realization you need to put a bit of effort and establish yourself in it. And as to how to do that, there is center out here in Ahmednagar where everything will be explained. And there are very simple methods which will cure many of your diseases. So if you have any illnesses, you can get those cured as well. My photo emits vibrations so that can also .be used for treatments.. And all these people are very wise and have done a lot of work in Sahaja Yoga. So I have no doubt about it. I am sure that someday there will be the largest number of Sahaja yogis in Ahmadnagar. I am very grateful to all of you for inviting me here and giving me so much love and respect. (Claps).

So now, those who wish to get their realization should stay back, and those who don’t should leave. We cannot force anyone here because the truth is not going to come and fall at your feet, it doesn’t need your votes. So those who want it should sit down with humility. Those who are meant to get it, will get it. To start with, all your physical problems will start disappearing as soon as the Kundalini starts rising. Day before yesterday, there was a man who came to our program in Wardha (in Maharashtra) who had a tumor in his brain. As soon as his Kundalini came up to that point, he started feeling very light – his tumor had gone away. So it can take only a moment. But that is not the case with everyone; I would like to tell you upfront. There was a lady in Rahuri (in Maharashtra) who was not able to hear. She said her ears are totally clogged. When I chanted one ‘Aham Sakshat Mantra’ in her ear, she could hear immediately. Some one had made her deaf by blowing in some mantra, and as it was extracted, she could hear again.  So everything we are telling you is the truth. There are no lies here, because we don’t want anything from you. We only want to give. Those who want it should take it and if not, they can leave. I won’t be hurt or offended at all. But being a mother, there is always this feeling that everyone should be blessed and become prosperous, should be blessed and become prosperous.

So now everyone sit down with your hands towards me.
