Talk on Attention

[English]
"The best way to strengthen yourself is to be together as Sahaja Yogis.  You must attend the programs, when there is a collective Aarti or Puja or Meditation. When you collect together, something happens to you. If you sit at home, and do something, nothing works out much.Anywhere when there are people sitting together in meditation, Sahaja Yoga itself manifests, because it is a collective phenomena."

[Translation]
How they work it out! This is the reason why when Mohammad Sahab came in he preached that you should not bow to anyone whatsoever because when a real person is bowed to you can recognize in any case. But there was a general view he was not talented but Nanak Sahib organized just a symbol of wisdom of great souls that you can bow only to that and not to anyone. But the followers as usual had committed such blunders that it appears like they are enemies of the great incarnations. It is not that in Sahaja Yoga. You get self-realization and little later may not be in beginning, you start feeling the pangs of sin. 

And also of their sinful people. So you avoid the company of sinful people. You have to. If you remain In the company of sinful people you get headaches, you get agnya catching, you get all sorts of complications and you want to run away from such people. Nobody can see that you have run away that you can’t bear it, that you body has become difficult. But the best way to strengthen yourself is to be together as Sahaja Yogis. You must attend the programs when there is a collective, aarti or puja or meditation. You are seeing that when you collect together something happens to you. If you see that you do something at home , nothing works out much. Anywhere there are people sitting together in meditation, Sahaja Yoga itself manifests because it is a collective phenomenon. It is such a collective phenomenon, I will give you an example of Gregoire. One day Gregoire he was sitting with me and he was not feeling vibrations and he was very much worried. I was watching from the window and another Sahaja Yogi was coming up the hill to my house. And immediately Gregoire started feeling the vibrations. Gregoire told me he is getting vibrations and I told him look who is coming. He saw that another Sahaja Yogi is coming. Just the presence of another Sahaja Yogi started giving vibrations to Gregoire. It is a collective phenomenon. How it works our collectively, why it works out collectively is again a question which is my job not yours. There is a mathematics about it. You must know that for everything there is a Mathematics. Everything works out like a mathematics. Why is it being made like that? 

Sahaja Yoga works out after actually there are more than seven people.  You have to understand how a collective phenomenon works out. If there is a realized person then he is surrounded by divine energy. . If there is a realized soul and he is not yet say that good and say he smokes. Let us say there is only one such person. If all his chakras are bad and he smokes/drinks. Say there is one such person. Every realized person has some weakness within. If a realized soul makes a mistake for some time, he comes back. When such a man is struggling to have an experience and If there is a positive person he may be having more vibrations and he may be able to spare some vibrations to prop up this man. It acts just like the valency of the atoms. But the only difference is that human beings can accumulate as much as they want they can change but the atoms cannot change. Those people who commit mistakes unknowingly, they are active in Sahaja Yoga, there also find it difficult / hard sometimes to overcome their hurdles. So if they go to someone who does not have this habit, then this person is helped. But they do not enter into your psyche but they bring about a cosmic change around. 

But supposing a person is suffering from bhoot badha (negativity), he is going to a Guru so the Guru will also fix certain entities with that fellow. When this one is trying to do something bad then he is supported by another bhoot badha wala. The fraternity works very hard. You have seen the example of that in our groups. If there is one person who has bhoot badha, You must ask Pradhan because he is done suffering from that. He is so much interested in people who have bhoot badha. So such a person when he goes and talks about his bhoot badha then another such person will come immediately to support him. He will be forced up. There is no freedom in it. He gets attracted like a magnet. Whatever it maybe a person with some bhoot badha will attract another such one and spoil them. Now what is the difference?

In first case you have to choose to be in the company of a Sahaja Yogi who does not have these habits. Say someone is a hot tempered person such a man if he can think of someone who is very silent by temperament then he should think of that person and he will become silent. Say there is a man who is so silent that he does not even mind his Mother being insulted and he feels bad about it that I cannot say anything about it then such a man if he thinks of someone who would not tolerate stuff like this then immediately he gets the power. But the difference is very much. One you have to choose. There are so many Sahaja Yogis who get attracted to negativity like this but to positivity they have to exert themselves. This is a system that works out. That is why I tell people that do not keep combinations of people who have same weaknesses. When i say that people feel hurt sometimes. But all over friendship is there. 

Say there are two Sahaja Yogis who talk ill of Sahaja Yoga, morning till evening finding faults with Sahaja Yoga. They will combine together because they keep good company. It is better to have diverse company so that you can supplement each other better than to be attracted to be people who have same vices especially of same family. Supposing there are Sahaja Yogis from one family, so you do not discuss Sahaja Yoga with them. Either they will fight or combine together. So best thing to do in Sahaja Yoga is to find out your own faults by sitting down. These are my faults. Say someone is a show off person then such a person should sit with a Shy person. This is a style of people different from negative people. Because two negative people can spread more negative. In Sahaja Yoga two opposites must meet. This must be done in complete freedom. 

What is realm of being good Sahaja Yogi? In one word you can understand, only one small thing. It is to be responsible. If you are a responsible Sahaja Yogi, you will find your own way. If you are not you will go your own way. If you are responsible God is going to give you more. If you behave irresponsibly, if you talk irresponsibly if you do not think what you can do for Sahaja Yoga and you are a liability for Sahaja Yoga , why should I do then he is not a real Sahaja Yogi. The people who are responsible in every way in their behavior they are Sahaja Yogi. Mohammad Sahab has said very clearly that in presence of the divine you should not budge from your seat, you should not move, your eyes should not rove about, you should not yawn. There are all sorts of things he said about behavior. Once you start feeling responsible you will know yourself what to do what not. Your habits will change automatically. Say someone talks too much then they will realize that need to be silent and someone who does not talks will realize that they need to talk. 

Once you take the responsibility of Sahaja yoga on your shoulders, immediately all the dimensions of your new life will open out. Knowledge will pour into you. You will get related to life in a new way. A new style of understanding is developed that faculties of life will open before you. The joy will pour into you. You feel Sahasrara open, as if river Jamuna is washing your feet. But you have to be responsible. I see very young people who are responsible. Mauritian is a very young responsible person. Whatever is possible he would like to do for Sahaja Yoga. You do not have to have money or anything. You have to feel responsible. This does not mean you come to my house ten times and if you are with me then you are responsible. This is a wrong idea. That means that if other should get a chance why should I, then they should. When you start leading a responsible life you will have a different light on your face, how things works out, how you will are speaking, as it is you know how it works out. Every moment it is.

Only you are connected to it and responsible. There are very few people on stage. Thousands are behind the scenes working for you. There are three people in Rahuri. How responsible they are and how responsibly they are behaving. When you start thinking on their lines that I am responsible for this, you will find out energy. If you think you are responsible for your family, you will find out these methods for your family. Now you are responsible for Sahaja Yoga. The sense of responsibility can come only through your freedom using the power of Sahaja Yoga. But for a negative person it comes automatically jolly well. Everyone is negatively charged when such a person talks. He may not have any truth but he talks. He is negatively charged and no freedom. That is not freedom. Human beings have to be free to be responsible. Is it that human beings are not yet evolved to be responsible? So in Sahaja Yoga when we think of our own development and our own emancipation…..
