We have to be responsible 26-01-1977

I need not say anything to you at all. I even feel very hurt to say anything to you, I don't like it. Because it's not in good taste for Me to say anything to anyone. I know many a times, many things I know about because it is not good for me to talk like that. After all it is very hard to be a mother and a teacher. It is a very very difficult task. You have no idea. Because I love you so much I cannot bear to say something harsh to you. If I say anything I feel very hurt and I weep sometimes I have to say. If you could be little responsible more every day. Every person must think that at least 10 persons I must bring to Sahaja yoga. It is my responsibility. Ten persons I must bring to Sahaja yoga and in such a manner that they are done up well. They are prepared well. They are ready. Find out ways and methods. Nobody has given me any schemes as to how to increase the activities of Sahaja Yoga. Sit down, think about it. I have already told that one method would be to have a program in a house of a Sahaja Yogi and all of you should go there and invite the neighbors saying that in our house we are going to have a program. Even for a small [UNCLEAR] you can get at least 500 women easily. So for Sahaja you can. Find out ways and methods. Find out ways and methods, how you can bring more people to Sahaja Yoga. One person is more responsible than another. It should not be so. And there are so many other things which you should also understand. For example, people write letters to me about lots of things [UNCLEAR] Iam meditating  to write book, like that, I am busy. You know I do not spare myself much. I do not write letters back. Sometimes I cannot. Even if you do not receive a letter you will be looked after. Remember that. But you must write letters. There are people who just do not write letters. I have seen it. Just do not write. You must learn to write letters. Today I received a very sweet letter from Mrs Knight and her husband. It is like a puja. So beautiful it was. You must write beautiful letters This is not the way to be responsible. Just you do not write. At least minimum you should write letters to me and to other Sahaja Yogis. That way I would say Shirayu she is very responsible. I never write to her, seldom I have time. She writes to me. She has so many problems. She has her children, she has her husband. But she writes to me beautiful letters. And even if I do not write to her she never minds me. [NAME UNCLEAR] Bai, if she was not have written letters to me she would not have composed such beautiful poems.

Another is Raul Bai. I seldom have time to write to her. But she writes to me. If I cannot answer you, you should not feel bad about it. This is one thing you must decide. That your Mother is very preoccupied and She is very busy. Your letters of course give me great happiness and you must write to me. But people seldom write. Seldom. Very few people really write to me. And they have no time for writing letters you see. This is not the way.

Now I will tell you the secret. It is very simple. You have read so many scriptures and you have read Ishwar Stuti or Devi Stuti all these things you have read. What do we write on our invitation cards? Come [UNCLEAR]. Jagadamba Prasanna (pleased). That is the Mother is in such pleasures you can say. She has been so happy. Or She is very happy about it. So you must just find out what will make Mother happy. What makes me happy. When you do something just weigh it out, will She be happy if we do like this. If we talk like this and say like these things. Will She be happy? It is very simple. You know me too well that I am not going to like it. I may not say about it, I may keep quiet. But I am not going to like it. That is a very good judging point. Do not do what you want to do and you like it. That is a wrong style. Absolutely wrong. But you should do what I would like you to do. And you know Me very well. And that is what it should be that Mataji Prasanna. This is a sort of a receptivity that Mataji Prasanna. In our house such and such wedding is going to take place. That She is happy. So do everything with that permission.

As it is I am very happy I must say this time because you have opened out very much this time and there has been a big progress. There is a big rise. But it should be done regularly and it must be kept up. I do not know how to tell you what has happened to you actually because it is a very big process which came into play. And it has worked out very well. And now you will be seeing your small small faults of your chakras which you are separated from and you are not bothered about it. So when you have a problem on your chakras try to clear them and keep them clean. And respect yourself and your responsibilities as Sahaja yogis. This is a very historical meeting of very very few people. And everything that we have done here has been of great help. Carry no malice in your heart but joy that you found a place where there is a goodwill of so many Sahaja yogis who are realized souls. And when they increase in number the ratio increases of the evolved souls who surround them in multiple proportions. Or you can say geometrical proportions, that is the correct way, that is mathematics. So the more you are the better it is and it is now your responsibility to be wise and to show some results till I am in Bombay and also in India. Let us see now everybody, how he goes about.

And the programs are going to be in Bharatiya Vidhya Bhawan. Sometimes it shocks Me when I see that in big programs Sahaja yogis are the last to come. All the rest of the people are there and Sahaja yogis are missing. So first of all find out ten people who will come for Sahaja yoga. Next program I do not know he will announce it where it is I do not know we have not yet decided. [Conversation with another yogi in Marathi]. In Bharatiya Vidhya Bhawan three and four. So you should find out people why they are doing like this. Why should not they come into it and go ahead with it. I even know Sahaja yogis which are lost you can go and talk to them and work it out if possible. If not, forget them. Let new people talk to them and tell them about Sahaja yoga. And I hope this three and four will be a very good program.

Now everybody should be responsible. Should find out if somebody needs flowers somebody can bring flowers. Somebody can bring Batti (light), somebody can bring something for the program. And somebody can bring... You see even when I go there then the adjustment starts of the radio and there this thing and that thing and such a waste of time and that is not good. But it is you see we find faults with others. We never find out ourselves what we have done about it. You see supposing somebody has not brought say the loudspeaker. So that fellow has not brought the loudspeaker so it is very wrong you see. But what have you done about it? Have you done something about it, have you found out something about it? And if everybody works it out, how to decorate, how to put it right and everything, how we are going to expand it, then the things will be alright.

Another program which all of you should know is on the 21st of March and I would like all the others to also come. You can bring some people from Rahuri, those people who want to come. 21st of March. 19, 20 and 21. At least if you can come for one day it is alright [conversation with another yogi in Marathi]. 19, 20, 21 we can have regular three-day program in that place. But in any case we organize something better this time 19, 20, 21. [conversation with another yogi in Hindi].
