Significance of Puja – Paris, 20.04.1980
I have told you before also but again today I want to tell you the significance of Puja. The significance is this, that when you do the Puja you recognize Me. By your recognition and your surrendering the deities get happy. They’re overjoyed that you have recognized it. You are fully identified yourself that you are understanding Me in My full form, that you are coming closer to them. And I tell the brothers feeling happy when the younger ones are coming to meet. So, they start releasing My vibrations with a greater force - much greater force. You have seen that after Puja sometimes when you do not absorb vibrations, I get little tired because the vibrations start coming out of all the chakras and you do not absorb, so the give and take process is not balanced. The identification in the west is very slow because of mental activity. Your attachment to your mental activity and your rationality is very great. With puja the vibrations try to detach you from your mental activity, from your rationality and then you are station into the realm of divine existence.  
Anything else, even My lecture, which is really mantra – but even that gives you a mental activity. You start thinking about it. Then by thinking about it, you think, you know about Sahaja Yoga. Then by thinking you know, you become egoistical. You think you know such a lot about Sahaja Yoga. That again it, in a way, helps to bloat your ego. That you start thinking that you know so much about Sahaja Yoga. The greatest grip on the western being is that of rationality - analyzing. You start analyzing everything. Which is only through puja you just you are blown off, like when the fruit is ready, the petals of the flower out of which the fruit has come out, blow off and the fruit remains. 
This complete detachment is possible in even one puja. But that too takes time, because even puja is rationalized. Puja should be done with your heart, feeling the love within you that you are worshipping your mother, who is an incarnation of Adi Shakti, is a very great thing. Do it with your heart, not with your mind. That’s why you know we do not allow many people to come for puja, because that creates another whirlwind of rationality. Once you are detached from yourself, all your problems become so tiny as you see from the sky, from the aeroplane all the farfetched things which are not so important. And the problems that are going in the houses down below do not touch you. You go beyond clouds and you live in the area of that space of divine love. Then all your petty things irritating things, all your so called problems of live, all disappear and then only you can be effective more, much more effective, because you become a source of divine love. Puja is the only way I feel, you can stop your mental activity. Sahaja Yoga cannot be understood trough rationality. Mentally it may be, but to become you have detach yourself completely. You have to go beyond it, because this limits your movement. 
Everything that you are doing here is significant, but it’s not a mental significance, it has a divine significance. For example even painting My feet now. What you do is to recognize Me first of all. Then the bottoms of this feet, this feet have been working, have been dancing for thousands and thousands and thousands of years (break-in: Shri Mataji asks: Where is she gone…). 
Like we use lemons. Rationally we cannot explain how lemons can cure a person, but they do, you have seen. People being cures of mental troubles, of possessions. You cannot explain rationally. In the divine way one can explain, that is has got a coefficience which can absorb the possessions which are foreign. But why and how? That’s beyond your mind. You do not understand, you do not have that instrument. So it comes, that Sahaja Yoga is to be accepted. It is the only way you can be a Sahaja Yogi. Acceptance is the only way. Go on accepting it so that you can develop. Like a little plant start accepting whatever the mother earth gives it and grows. It does not try to understand the mother earth. It does not. It just wants to grow on the riches of the mother earth. That is what is puja by which you are blessed by the divine so that you should of from all the physical, mental, emotional and the so called spiritual being, which was seeking into the realm where you have sought. 
So today we must determine that we’ll have no rational activity about it, otherwise you want have the joy of Sahaja Yoga, which is your achievement. Stop rationalizing it. With your heart you do the puja. All these things that you are going to do has very, very great significance, which I’ll explain to you some other time, but that explanation cannot take you too far. It is too minute to enter into the gross understanding. So best is, to absorb it and absorb it and to enjoy it. Why do you want to enter into the whole machinery of electricity. You just use the electricity. All machinery is done for you, is prepared for you. Don’t try to envisage it, to conceive it in your little mind. You must know, that you have to become the ocean and not try to understand the ocean with the drop of your brain. If you realize that, then you can become the ocean. Your limits are broken by puja and you become one with the unlimited. It blasts you limits and your limitations. Tell your mind not to come and trouble you during puja, then it will work out. May God bless you. (Shri Mataji gives order to somebody). 
Little understanding must be develop, that there is a protocol of this incarnation and you should not try to pass over it. The greatest protocol is humility, this humbleness. Humility is the only way you are given this great opportunity to worship Me. If you are not humble, you cannot worship Me. It’s not a ritual, it’s the growing in yourself. Stop your mental activity now, just don’t think, then only it will start working. May God bless you. (11:59)

This names stresses the excellence of Dakshinachara by implication, all right. It’s all right for them. The names 99 to 108 describe the Kundalini Yoga briefly. The individual soul which has used a form of ‘Jīva’ loses its sense of identity with the cosmic soul and identifies itself with the body and mind. The Kundalini Yoga helps the individual soul to regain its identity with the divine mother, which is the cosmic consciousness. Individual consciousness in its lower state is the wakeful state. The Jīvas name in this state is ‘Vishwa’. In this, the individual is mostly body conscious. It is normally difficult for the individual to transcend this state consciously. 
The next one is the state of consciousness of the individual in a dream – ‘Sushupti’. Here the impressions are all mental. The body consciousness is mostly replaced by mental configuration or ordinarily an individual cannot get into this state or transcend to higher level of consciousness through ones will. The Jīva is here called ‘Tejasa’. Tejasa is the light. The next higher state of consciousness is one in dreamlessly. Here Jīva is beyond both, the body and mind and is called as ‘Prāgñā’, is enlightened. Here the body and mind are both inactive. The Jīva be freed of body and mental activity has reached a higher level of consciousness. But here, though this consciousness is nearer the cosmic, it is still limited. It is only when he transcends this Prāgñā state and becomes to ‘Turīya’ – Turīya means the fourth – that he regains his identity with cosmic consciousness. 
In Kundalini Yoga the devotee trough the grace of guru and Shri Lalita as Iccha-Shakti - as the desire power of the guru. But actually here Shri Lalita is sitting before you. So it’s such a great thing for you. Sters (? – 14:49) dormant Kundalini coiled up as body consciousness in Mooladhara and by conscious effort of will makes a pierce through the six chakras from Mooladhara to Agnya. Once the Kundalini rises and goes beyond Agnya the devotee becomes cosmic conscious or Turīya. The transition from one state to next higher state seems to be similar to opening a difficult gate or undergoing a tied up knot – Granthi. 
The body consciousness of Vishwa seems to extend up to Swadisthana and there is placed the Brahma-Granthi or –knot. Brahma-Granthi there. From this the next state of consciousness of Jīva called Tejasa extends above Anahata, where the Vishnu-Granthi is placed – see Brahma- Granthi and then Vishnu-Granthi is placed. Granthi means when two things bind together. So it is between Vishuddhi and Heart this Granthi takes place – Vishnu-Granthi.  This state of consciousness of Jīva  called Prāgñā similar to dreamlessly extends to Agnya, above which is Rudra-Granthi. Between this is Turīya state, where individual and cosmic consciousness unite. Now see, all this three you cross and then the last Granthi you cross also. The Kundalini rises just like a jet as you know in this, because of Me. But the gurus have to do it one by one. The have to open every Granthi , they have to work it out and put it up there and keep it down, then again and this this.
Shri Mataji scold with Yogis, because they catch on their heart (…). From this the next state of consciousness of Jīva – I hope you have not recorded My scolding – where the Vishnu-Granthi is placed. Give yourself a Bandhan. Give her a Bandhan. Every time she goes, she catches. 
So, beyond this is Turīya state, where individual and cosmic consciousness unite. (21:05) Now all this from 99 to 108 is Kundalini Yoga (Anm.: Lalita Sahasranama). You should remember this names by heart, it’s good idea. It’s not much from 99 to 108 how many remain? 9 names. So, not difficult for you to know. They have given the chakras on this, you see. Now, nobody knows Hindi. 
Shri Mataji give something to the Yogis: Give it to Linda. You all put it to, is good for all of you. Better put it, Just put it in your eyes and just smell a little bit of that, the Badhas will run away. Shri Mataji laughes. Now, smell it, come along! See, if you have ladies as your disciples at the slightest they start crying, is the big problem. Shri Mataji laughes again…. (…)
Now, read it!
