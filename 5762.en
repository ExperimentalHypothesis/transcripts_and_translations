Shri Mataji: You should, because it’s on the supraconscious, the future. He knows from the future, you see the spirits come and tell you.

Yogi: And he knew things what was going to happen and why those things happening. Will be then able to manipulate [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: You see this is the power of the spirits coming on him, that he doesn’t know. The same spirit [UNCLEAR] bone by bone [UNCLEAR] He doesn’t know what he has done. He is not going to be perfect. All of them how you can say [UNCLEAR]

Yogi: I don’t think he realizes. He lost that realization to realize the possibilities. [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: You see something like this thing goes in your head. The action. That’s the advantage. That’s a very good advantage [UNCLEAR] and then you just don’t get a response, [UNCLEAR] just don’t understand [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: According to the Quran no guru, no teacher can be either be involved in [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Not being involved.

Yogis talking

Shri Mataji: Of course not. You see how can be

Yogis talking

Shri Mataji: You see actually I [UNCLEAR] you get detached in a sense, you become the personality, what a detached personality. They don’t know what faith is. They become famous is a different part. But you don’t know what is famous. Just don’t care, just don’t care. the person who is truthful also understands. But the one who is realized, the one who is going to be the guru or is the guru is the one who just doesn’t care for these things. It doesn’t come into him. I give you an example [UNCLEAR] there was a rich man and his sister was down with cancer, [UNCLEAR] I give you so much money, I’ll buy you an Ashram, [UNCLEAR] He said that my wife is possessed. And she is such and such and if she says, my wife, [UNCLEAR] you see some or other try to [UNCLEAR] Very seriously

She is [UNCLEAR] they took her to the hospital and got cured.

Very sweet and she was herself [UNCLEAR] She came on a plane. 

Such a [UNCLEAR] a good person, not that Mark was bad, he was also a good person, but some dirty woman must have come in-between and you have such funny ideas you must change your wifes like American people have you must change your fridge, and you must change your this, you must change your wife, change is the sign according to them a sign of [UNCLEAR] whatever it is.

So I think something like that, but it is very serious allegation about her. She was such a fine person. So and then she didn’t talk about and he came to see me and he said: “Mother what do you think about her?” I said, “She is one of the finest American woman I know. She is a very devoted wife, and don’t call any other, has a power on her own and I will not touch her by back you think.”

Mother you think she is not possessed? I said, “Not at all.” [UNCLEAR] What about cancer? I said, She can’t. There’s no possibility. She is a very devoted wife, a very nice person and she loves you. And if you try to have a divorce you will be a very miserable person. Just don’t know. It is not at all for you, as a Mother I am telling you she is my daughter and I am proud of her. His face went down. So I said, you see. [UNCLEAR]

When I went to Chandigarh, Mother you have no pragmatic approach, what pragmatic, he couldn’t understand a word. He said it should be practical, what practical? Why did you say that, how come? Chandigarh. Do you know, if there is an innocent person and if you grant an innocent person like this, let alone me, I would never do that, even if you do that it is a very great sin which you cannot fill up by giving realization to [UNCLEAR]. Now will you do it? After all he is an Indian man, you see, we are going up, I am going up, if she is a woman like that, what Mataji says, [UNCLEAR]. Like that, the whole thing is fizzling down. Doesn’t matter.

What are we going to do with these buildings? You have to have your own created. Temples are to be built of human beings and not of houses, which are going to crumble down. We have to put living images not things by which people are impressed for time being and then when you die they say that they never take their names.

Such a person cannot, just you see. Just does not bother. See about fame. What is fame?

It’s nonsense. What is a fame? What is the thing just tell me? I don’t never understand. What is fame, means what, you see. If it means somebody says, oh you are great, run away from that person. Because you see they maybe wanted something out of you. Normally none of the incarnations got fame. They only got stones and restrictions. None of them got.

But there is only one way in Sahaja Yoga is that, because you are going to get actualization, you are going to get the experience of it. That’s why in your heart God is there to reside. This is the way. If you call it this way, I accept that.

If that sort of a fame you feel. If you feel now learning from the person. It’s the fame which comes out of auspiciousness. The auspiciousness is a thing we say personality by which you improve in your being, every way, success, not this worldly success, but success that is satisfying, Shri (???) means the grace that is beautifying, such a person is auspicious. Such a person will have a kind of a fame which will be different from [UNCLEAR] styles. The world is going to change.

They are not going to have Lord Byron for a statue. No they are not. Or Wellington [UNCLEAR] we are going to have something else. Now people want to change, their awareness is going to change completely. They are going to care for people who have that eternal essence in them. They are not going to bother

Yogi: I think, talking about these false gurus I don’t understand one thing that scene against the holy spirit all the worst  in all the worst [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: It’s very simple to understand. Supposing somebody beats you, you wouldn’t mind, but somebody beats me, will you be able to detain it in your heart? The same way Christ had said, It’s alright if you insult me, but if you insult my Mother [UNCLEAR] force.

There are 11 powers he has got by which he [UNCLEAR] to all such people

It’s very simple to understand. You are not to insult the Mother of Christ, it’s very dangerous. That’s why he never told anybody that she was the Holy Spirit. She was the Holy Ghost. That’s why she didn’t say it, because that was a protective thing. She was.

Ask a question

[UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Maria are you busy with this whole thing?

Maria: I just finished.

Shri Mataji: She is so sweet. She is working so hard. Will you please go and help her

Yogi: It’s very logical, I mean. If he is the son and if he is the son of God, then he must be God. I wonder why he couldn’t see that you know.

Shri Mataji: You see that’s the trouble. They can see somethings which you cannot sees. This is maya. [UNCLEAR] You see something which does not exist. And you do not see that is exists, its illusion. It’s the illusion. If you can get, you see, into that state from where you see the illusion you just enjoy, know the illusion. Ahh Just now as you are laughing at yourself  its nice. [UNCLEAR] isn’t it. It’s a big joke [Shri Mataji laughing] I was also there,

Yogi: Yes, this is how the whole of maya is, till you got beyond

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] you see, you are the crucified ones. How to expose them, you see this is the trick of the maya if you understand. [UNCLEAR] See you cannot treat them like that you see, because they have entered into your heads. So now how do I do it? Is to put you there. You go into that. You see them and then get out of it and it would be with a greater force and greater humility from these horrible gurus.

Yogi: [UNCLEAR] said something very funny when we were in September, we were there. He was talking about the story about a Brahmin who had rice. He went to the king’s palace, on his way out he stole some jewelry and they couldn’t understand why he stole the jewelry. Because he was a saint who stole the jewelry. They discovered eventually that the food they have eaten came from the village of thieves. He returned the jewelry.

Shri Mataji: What about him doing that the same?

Yogi: and then he said. He said the story looking at me and afterwards he walked out, because we just 2 hours before discussing this question the money they owe us, what they have done. He said to me as he walked out, “You see. It was any 2 months later he was apologizing for his own deeds? He then said .. the people in this room will gonna bring down the movement.

Shri Mataji: No no no, [UNCLEAR] Not that day, he was trying to prove, to say these things and all that. Just to show that I know what you are talking about. He is a thief. And certifying, see, I can, the dictionary I don’t understand what to say, I have no words to say what sort of a man he is. He should really get somebody from Lucknow. They will nice abuses which they use for such people. You know what I can write to someone, write about 21 of them to send him back, this is this, this is this, you are. This is the mantra you say about yourself, I am this, I am that.

You know, I will tell you, I cannot image what sort of a man he is. We had one like that. [UNCLEAR] Once we had a very great swindler, great swindler. His name was Dharampet. [UNCLEAR] but he met Jawaharlal Nehru in America and in these matters our Prime Minister was very nice. He was very fond of people who were properly dressed and very you see English manner and spoke good English and we had all the English. I mean he was Cambridge [UNCLEAR]. They should say superb. So that kind of a thing our families was very much interested.

So this fellow, went and told him that, ‘I am doctor, I am this, English and all, and also our prime minister, they say so, I don’t know, [UNCLEAR] he could officiated [UNCLEAR].

His wife was very good looking woman as they say. I have not seen her. I have seen this horrible fellow and he managed him somehow. And then he went back to India. That time I’m telling you that I am gone to received my husband at the airport. And you know for us they allowed us inside the lounge and we came out. And I saw this man with a big hat. I asked my husband, who is this man? Why do you want to know? I said, but you tell me who is this man.

He said, why are you so childish? I said ‘I am not childish, I am anxious. So he said, alright I tell you his name. His name is [UNCLEAR]. What is he doing there?

Why do you want to know about him? Of all the persons why him. I said because [UNCLEAR] Really? Oh God, is he connected with you? He said, ‘Very much’. ‘How’? He is coming for shipping. Then you know what happened this fellow went to Jwala Neru and his wife would have a breakfast with him and she used to order this and that. 

Jwalaji, as I told you, was a very nice person and he never understood that this fellow is [UNCLEAR].

Then he was given from that food, can you imagine, 65 karos of [UNCLEAR]

But my husband as soon as the proposal has came he put on [UNCLEAR] because I was after his life. They transferred him and they gave him a bigger post and they said you can become chairman of the shipping corporation. And they gave him 65 lakhs of Rupees. And the parlament passed a great prime minister. 65 karos, [UNCLEAR] and then he bought ships he cheated all the big ship yards, never paid them any money. He ordered the ships, he talked to the [UNCLEAR] and every time he took to the prime minister there and another minister the deputy prime minister who is nowadays our prime minister the great fellow, the one who brings the English.

He took him there and this fellow, this Desi was the one who was to inaugurate and big this thing and naturally you see the poor people [UNCLEAR] couldn’t say anything.

Because the prime minister, deputy prime minister coming in, garland him, this that and he is going to launch the ship. They launched the ship and this fellow never gave them the money. The ship was lost permanently, and they had no way occur collectivity. And these are the two great people of our country. Can you imagine, the one who is to be the prime minister and the one who [UNCLEAR] and they gave him 65 crore of Rupees. Now,  this happened and then suddenly the whole thing started to come up just like this you see and then one man he found it out. And he leaked it.

The government, then he leaked it to the police and all that and then my husband was in Japan and he suddenly came. I said, ‘How?’ Then they told him that this man, supposed to have killed his first wife, took her money and then come to India and this and that and that and that and because of this thing started off they found out also about shipping. And these two great giants of our country, what should I call them, you see.

They were saying, you see, ‘don’t have that

The police is very bad, don’t harass them. They are supporting them, these two. But they were simple. They didn’t take any money from him as such. But then this man was absolutely caught and then he one day just ran away from them to some place in Panama from where you don’t have any extradition. 

The whole thing was hashed out and all those ships were frozen, all these money was frozen, still he managed to take away 4 crore of rupees.

This best part of it, my husband says very seriously to me , ‘You know the 250 Rupees you have to pay for registration that also that thug did not pay. Even that he did not pay and our great people like Jawala Nehru and Monarchie Bhai [spelling?] are great supporters of him. You shouldn’t feel bad of what has happened.

[Shri Mataji laughing]

You see. It is that. And then he was arrested. He came to London [UNCLEAR] he was telling stories after stories. Jawalaji had died by then. You see. [UNCLEAR] Did such a foolish thing. If you see his old age, looks like aged person.

And then this case started in London. And then he said, another drama he played, he said you see these people are all against Jawalaji, to take bad name. vand the judge was listening to him. He just said,

‘Now, have you finished? Now I see that you are a crook of the first quarters and you are a thug and you are this and you are that. And now will you shut up!’ That’s what they say.

I said that’s the  [UNCLEAR]

And he said, ‘You take two running jumps and go to hell!’  These are the words he used. And then he was in jail. He came out of jail and Indira Ghandi came, another great lady behind the prime minister. She saw to it that he goes out of [UNCLEAR]. Now he is out.

So are we not sufficiently luted? You want more examples?

[Shri Mataji laughing]

It’s a fact, you see. Imagine people like that. And I would not blame Jawala for this, because he had such a big secretariat with the best, the cream of our country, most intelligent people. All the intelligence of India was behind this and they all did, good faith, the good faith part. And none of them got a single pie.

Hello, how are you?

Yes yes, very nice children they are. Come along, Come along, Come along, I’ve been just waiting for you to come down here. Come along, come along, sit down, sit down, sit down.

Good, Aha, the force has come. You see the vibrations. Just see the vibrations. All of them, how beautiful, all are realized. Just look at these children. Beautiful they are. Can you remove this and they can sit comfortably. This lady [UNCLEAR]

[Maria talking unclear. ]

Good, you said there will be only 10 people. Maria you said there will be only 10 people

Maria: Yeah I thought so.

Shri Mataji: Good. And the great people have come. These are great people. What’s your name? You must tell your name. 

Yogis laughing

What’s your name? See the eyes, sparkling, look at this see beautiful they are, aren’t they. Just put your hands like this, lets see if the cool breeze, alright? Just like this, she is born realized. They speak Hindi. What language they speak?

Yogini: Gujarati.

Shri Mataji: Gujarati. Thaṇḍī lāgē chē. All of them just see the vibrations. Can you feel that? Tremendous. [UNCLEAR] 

Hello. See that. I mean this is what it is. Can you see, can you feel that? Can you feel the vibrations? Now let’s just see who is great. They do the job for me. I don’t have to say anything. Please put your hands also like this, all of you, just like this. It’s so simple. See that, you feel some cool? In the hand? Yes, cool. 

Are you feeling alright there, all of you? Are you feeling the cool breeze? See are you feeling? See you have to be great people to be the Mother of such great children, they are great children. And they selected you as their Mother. There must be some reason for it. Beautiful. It’s beautiful.

Open that window, that window is better. You open that one.

It’s good, from where did you come?

Oh I didn’t see, [UNCLEAR] that’s another one born realized. 

Are you feeling the cool breeze? 

Yogi: [UNCLEAR]

Good See, have more of it and more of it. Let it go inside, absolutely.

They got cold, got cold, nice [UNCLEAR].

Nice, it’s beautiful. See you already got it in the hand. Why should you worry? So many children are born in this country.

Are you fine? Better now, feeling better, better now?

The best thing is you must I know the know-how. Otherwise you don’t have to believe in it. Why should you believe anyone who doesn’t tell you the know-how. They call it science. Do you have any knowledge of science about you don’t have to know-how? In Sahaja Yoga even children, everything. Good. [UNCLEAR]

Maria house is blessed many times. Isn’t it. It’s beautiful. Beautiful children. 

Better now. [UNCLEAR]

Why don’t you sit down Bala?

The chair people can go back. You see. Then others can sit in-between. All those who are occupying chairs should go to the back, better idea so that those who sit in front can see. 

Pushed a little bit this side

Hallo, come along. We had a very nice session of great laughter. Something like talking about Charlie Chaplin.

[Yogis talking]

I think you should put these chairs down or back so that they can see. You are alright, sit.

[Yogis talking]

They have been having a big laughter.

[Yogis talking]

Come come come come

[Yogis talking]

Alright. They are never late, can you sit on the ground?

[Yogis talking]

So all the forum is complete? All of them? [UNCLEAR] They have brought the real force, you see all of them. Yes they have brought [UNCLEAR].

Just sit like this with the hands, follow me.

[Yogis talking]

Are you feeling the cool breeze? Good. Got it already. See it’s so simple. What about you?

Just see that. Just see. What about you? Are you feeling the cool breeze? Not yet. You will know if it is there.

No sort of, you will feel everything. We were just laughing about all the things, how they have cheated all of us, and all that. [Shri Mataji laughing] Oh God, and now we know. Now we have to decide and plan out how [UNCLEAR] all of them. So it’s a plan we have to work it out.

[UNCLEAR]

It has to settle down, an experience which needs to be settled down. The Kundalini rises at the first shoot.

There is no, there is a problem, I would say that, as I have told you before. I couldn’t give realization [UNCLEAR] at all, wether foreigners nor Indians. There is something special about you, that your own Motherland, you see, that power. It is spontaneous, it is very forceful and it does happen. But then it settles back, in a sense it has to look after all the centers and all the problems you are having. So it comes down. Then you start thinking about it, that’s the point where you are at fault. You cannot think about it. You didn’t get it by thinking. This one thing you must know that you did not get it by thinking. You got it because it has to happen. So if you think about it, it will slow down. You cannot think about it. It is love. How can you think about love? It’s not science. Just now if you watch your eye, if you watch yourself. You are beyond thoughts. Most of the time, there is no thought. Why? You done it. 

Are you too close to that? Find it too hot? You can put it off, I think, just a light, is it?

Better? Are you feeling the cool breeze nicely? Good. So lets talk of something nice now. Let’s talk something about the light. We talked about [UNCLEAR] too much.

[Yogis talking]

What did you say, she has?

[Yogini talking]

You got Rama’s Mantra. Catch in the right heart, you can also feel it. The catch is on this. This is Rama’s chakra. I will tell you about this.

[Yogis talking]

So I will have to tell you about ourselves, what are we. Actually we know so little about ourselves. This ignorance is responsible for this kind of a problem that you all have faced, because you are so ignorant about it. And the reason is the knowledge about what I am going to tell you, you can only have when you are a realized soul. Without that one cannot talk about that, one cannot explain it to you. Because it is too fantastic. It’s so fantastic that you cannot believe it and you cannot except it. And that’s why it is not for human mind to conceive it. It goes beyond. If I say that there is God’s Divine power which is the most dynamic power, which is the only power that guides this creation, that coordinates everything, that looks after us, and that has made us human being. You won’t believe it, that there is such a power of love.

All that you see other things is absolutely false. It’s just a reflection, is not the mirror. And this power has entered into every atom, every molecule and can control all that. We see it every day those things but we take it for granted. Like we see the flowers suddenly becoming the fruits. How would they become? A mango tree will give you mangoes, i won’t give you roses. How does it happen? If you see even in chemistry elements that are created on this earth have a regular planning about it. They are divided in to exactly 8 divisions. Now how all this happens, we never think about it. We take it for granted, we try to find out what we see, what it is, and then we say oh we are great scientists. But you cannot say how it works. Even if you take a sulfur dioxide, an ordinary atom of sulfur dioxide, The sulfur atom is on top and there are two oxigen. If you see it under microscope you can find out that it pulsates. And there is a kind of vibration that is passing between these atoms. And these vibrations are of three types. Unequal, equal, similar all sorts and who does that? And how, why. That certain act like this and certain like this. Even the matter which is a dead thing, which we do not think is capable of having an energy in it. That’s what we used to think. Now of course you have changed your ideas about that. That too has such a beautiful arrangement. Even up to the molecule state, up to the atom state you can see how it is mathematically arranged, the protons and the neutrons around. It is just to see and wondering. 

And when you see it in the nature and these elements there atoms then you see later on when you start watching something much more complex that is a living cell with a carbon coming into it. We just take it for granted. We never bother. From where is this carbon coming and how this carbon combination life came. We just take ourselves also for granted as if we are great kings and that whatever we have got our human life is our own, you see sort of thing.

And thinking that if we have this human body is our special right to have it. Even this eye of ours, if you see, is such a complex camera, how it works, instantaneously, how it captures. Is something beyond our comprehension. So vindicated [not sure about this word],

we don’t see, its alright we take it for granted. That’s the way human beings live with it. If you cannot cope with the thing, what we do is to accept it for granted. That’s a sensible thing to do. In the same way nature has made you specially in such a manner that you cannot hear certain frequencies. You can only hear certain frequencies. You are created with such beautiful adaptations, nature and surrounding. This Earth is moving with such a tremendous speed, you do not feel. Spinning around so fast you cannot feel. We take all these for granted and we think we are human beings. But why are you human beings? Why have you become human beings? 

What can you find out, what did you find out so far, whatever you can see, whatever is absolutely fracture that you have found out. You have not been able to find out why these thing happened and how these thing happened. How are you going to find out about such a complex thing that is a human being. You have become a human being without doing anything about it. 

And what are you going to do? For getting that awareness by which you are going to know yourself, nothing, nothing whatsoever. On the contrary effort human beings put, because they have a sense that they can put in effort. But you reach a certain stage later on that you are really working out, you are just sitting down very nicely, the whole thing is working out.

Say for example there is a relay in London about some programs in the TV. Now it’s all in the atmosphere, you don’t see. And suddenly you start your TV you get it. What effort have you put in? It was all build-in there. And it was all, whatever was done on the other hand was also done by somebody. You have just put on the switch and you get pictures, which you do not see normally on the walls nowhere, but suddenly you get them. They are there, exist. But you believe into it, because this you see with your own eyes. It is an actual thing, that’s why you believe into it. And that’s why you must believe into it when it’s an actual thing. So we come to that position where we understand that if anyone talks about higher life, about the power beyond this then we must have actualization of it. We must feel it. At this point there is a problem because it is easy to talk about peace. Like there is a higher life, there is God, and this and his power working and all that. All this lecture you can hear from many people. Even actualization of it you see, they may say that jump like a frog is actualization. Yes we had people like that. 

You know in one of my lectures one gentleman was sitting both his feet towards me. I said, it’s alright for me but I don’t know what is going to happen to this gentleman, you see. Then one of the boys went and said, ‘You are not suppose to sit like this towards Mother’. He said, ‘You see, I am sorry but if I sit in any other form, I cannot sit and start jumping like a frog’. So I said, ‘How do you think that this happens?’ ‘It happens every time and if I do it now it will start, like that.’ So I said, ‘But why this is happen?’ Doesn’t matter, Kundalini has a reason, I am a self-realized person. ‘Who has told you this?’ He took out a big book like that, you wont belief such a big book and he showed me, written down there ‘When Kundalini rises you start jumping like a frog’. Who is this gentleman, this is some Acharia Brahma some sort of a name, such a big name you see and horrible person’s photograph on the thing. Such a big book and this fellow is carrying on his head all the time jumping like a frog. And he says, that yes you have to jump like a frog.

Why? I asked him. Now when you are going to evolve are you going to become a frog or a monkey, what are you going to be, this is first thing.

You can use your brains for this to understand what to expect, you see. You are not going to become like monkeys or pigs or even lions. You are already the highest and you have to be something higher. So that will sit out. Then the fellow says, another one, who came to me, and he says, ‘The best was we had one frog warming up [UNCLEAR]

This is David, this is our Sahaja Yogi, very sweet otherwise poor thing. He came yesterday and I said, what happen David, what where you doing like this and why did you do all these things after coming to Sahaja Yoga. He said, there must be some devil on me, on supra conscious level. But he said Mother, he was so subtle, one of the subtlest one you should understand, that he told me, that he was this and this and that you will give me realization.

He came in my ears and told me, can you imagine to that extend it was. And so he believed in that kind of a spirit and he was telling all the time. But I said, for telling you why should you use any spirit? You can read it in Time Out. Use your brains.

Then we have another one, where we think we can purchase in the market. There are courses [UNCLEAR] three weeks course, three years course for sharing of all your property. So we go in, you see, for that. Then all such things one must understand cannot be anywhere near reality. So what should we expect, what should be the reality. What we call of knowledge of self.

First science has given a certain thing which we should try to understand. And if you understand through science you can understand that. Science has given us an understanding that there is a power which we cannot comprehend through our rationality. Even a person like Einstein, said, ‘I could not find the theory of relativity in the laboratories. I was tired, i was laying down and I was playing soap bubbles and suddenly the whole theory of relativity dawned upon him. Because he was a realized soul. So it has not come from the [UNCLEAR] these people themselves are saying. So whatever knowledge has come to us, has not come through so-called scientific research but through the grace of some power. Science cannot explain many things.

For example, the science [Shri Mataji talking to Yogis]

For example they cannot say why so many things happened in the human body. For example, it is said that any foreign body that enters in the system creates a situation by which the body tries to throw it out. But it’s only the fetus which is retained in the womb, nurtured and looked after and thrown away at the time, when the thing absolutely mature. So there is somebody who thinks about it.

Then there are two chemicals, chemicals there are adrenalin and [UNCLEAR] which are secreted in our being at different points. And they cannot explain how these ordinary chemicals sometimes augment and constrict and sometimes [UNCLEAR] at different times. They cannot explain it. So they will say, they are honest. They say the mode of action of these chemicals in the human body cannot be explained.

They behave differently from their own nature, so Baba, from their own nature. There are many such things which I can throw up to you and show you, that man reaches a point a various things that there is something else which takes the decisions.

Now when you reach that stage, then you start thinking, that through science we feel that there is something that we cannot explain and that rationality cannot take it up there. So there must be some answer to it. The answer comes from psychology. I would say Jung was one of the greatest psychologist ever. The oppose Freud, because Freud you know was a horrible psychologist. He was a fellow, who was treating all kinds of abnormal things. He never treated normal things. So he got possessed by that. And he started behaving abnormal. Himself was a very abnormal person, he had very abnormal relationships, he was really absurd, his own lifetime. And he had a very bad death, he had cancer, he died . But still all of the western world worships him. They never see what he achieved in his own lifetime, what sort of a person he was, what was his relationship with other people and how really he was very anxious always taking pills and he died of terrible cancer and in a very rigid condition he died.

While Jung, in his old age he got his realization and he was of a very different nature and when he died he used to look, he was looking like a flower. But people do not see all that. They just see what he writes. And because it’s so sad to listen to Freud, I don’t know why it suits them, actually it should not normally. So Mr. Freud has come up. You will find out that this great man has done so many experiment with thousands of people and has established, and has established that there are forces beyond us, which control, and the forces beyond us which control us.

He called them as universal unconscious. Unconscious because they are not in our conscious mind. And he called them as, also as. You see actually he did not know how to name it so he said that, he has said it, it is the Mother’s force, it is a motherly force. Very clearly he said that. And he studied also Indian literature and all that and he has developed some thought on Shakti path also. He has used the word Shakti for the universal unconscious.

But still he was just a realized soul. There was no mother to tell him all about it what it was. So he couldn’t indicate and tell you that there is a universal unconscious which is guiding you. He experimented with people with their dreams. There is a very famous dream, which he interpreted, about a man who would always dreams that he has to  bow to his son. His son is sitting on a pedestal and he has to bow to his son. The son might be a realized soul. So he came to him and he said ‘I don’t know why I get such a dream.’ So Jung asked, ‘what is your relationship with your son?’ He said, ‘Very very bad’. I say, ‘Why’ ‘You see his mother is dead and I married again and my wife is very angry with him and I really don’t know how to manage it. The relationship has gone very bad.’ He said, ‘The unconscious is telling you that you must bow to him. He is of a higher awareness, so you must bow to him. It is giving you a balance.’

There was another girl who came to him with a dream, just putting two dreams together I am telling you, he said that, ‘I see my mother as a witch’. So he asked the girl, ‘What is your relationship with your mother?’ She said, ‘It’s very fine, very good. She actually pampers me, she has pampered me so much that I am jeers good for nothing.’ ‘That is the thing coming to you from your unconscious to suggest that your mother is a witch who is spoiling you.

And there are 1001 like that, you see there are so many volumes of books which you can read for yourself. So the psychologist said to us that the state of human awareness that it will reach to a point where it will be thoughtlessly aware. He will be aware, but there won’t be any thought. This is said by Jung who was a psychologist. So we should know what we have to expect.

Now there’s another source which is very clear and very very [UNCLEAR] which we can understand are the scriptures. If you read John’s Revelation you can read about [UNCLEAR]. You will know that the cool breeze is to be expected, if you read Adi Shankaracharya because he is the one who has completely exposed the whole thing in the 6th century [ie 600s]. This knowledge was a secret knowledge before that.

Because the evolutionary forces have not taken its proper course. It was kept as secret knowledge, a guarded knowledge, for very few. Only in the 6th century [ie 600s] he started exposing it and Kabira and Nanaka, all these people came out full exposition of Kundalini.

The greatest work on Kundalini was in Maharashtra, where Nath, the 9 Nathas, the primordial masters they call themselves, worked out and also in other places, they also came from Punjab. There was a big report Punjab and Maharashtra and they went into the forest, meditated and religiously tried to find out the works of the Kundalini, what was the force, what was the secret within us, what was the germinating force that is going to give us this. Because only one or two were realized, whenever they talked about realization, nobody could believe them and they couldn’t understand. There is a force like that and they said, Oh we are happy with ourselves.

Moreover the people who were realized, had such bad experiences of all these people, like they were beaten up, crucified, they were poisoned, I mean imagine the people. What was there to crucify Christ. I still can’t understand. So the very sensible people of this world looked at all the explanation about God and Divinity with that kind of a hostile attitude. And there was no way of changing this attitude of these people. And this hostility was expressed even by religious organization. You see, anybody who was a realized soul was thrown away from the churches, from temples, these brahmins killed them, they tortured them, the last one that we had was Shirdi Sai Nath. And if you see how the brahmins from another area from [UNCLEAR] how they tortured him you would be surprised. Not only that, they brought a snake charmer with a snake to kill and he got hold of the snake and talked to the snake, you see snake went away and bit charmer. Then he was the one who got up and saved the charmer. And he told him, don’t do all these things. He said, I would not but these people brahmins have given me.

So the people who were supposed to be in charge of religion themselves crucified those saints who talked of reality. That’s how reality was completely blinded. Nobody could see it and people were get.

This was the problem and that’s why somebody had to come and do this to give en-Masse realization to people. So that it becomes a common knowledge. Everything that is discovered by one person has to become the common knowledge otherwise it has no meaning. Even in the science you see, you find out about Electricity, it has a big mystery behind it, whatever it is but at a point is has to become a common knowledge. If it is not a common knowledge it is never accepted and it has no value at all. It has to become a knowledge of every human being otherwise it has no meaning.

And the time has come fo you to have the actualization and to have the complete knowledge of your being. What you are, what you are going to be, what you could have been, what are the problems around. So in us is placed a germinating force. We are all built in, its like a computer, absolutely living computer within us is placed through our evolution, one by one, step by step. All these points have been properly put down in our backbone, in our brain and in the limbic area here, absolutely [UNCLEAR] and only thing one has to do is to surrender to accept it. But we surrender to all kinds of nonsensical things, but to the right person our Ego will immediately stand out, you see.

If somebody has two hearts it is very easy to surrender. Or if somebody is very cunning very easy to surrender. But where do you surrender, is to the Divine force, to yourself, to your wisdom. What do you surrender is your nonsensical idiotic Ego. What do you have to surrender to God, what do have, only this known knowledge which has come to you through Ego and sometimes through these possessions which is supra conscious.

——

Now for surrendering people think, how can I surrender. Now you cannot think about it, how should I surrender. Can you work it out on a paper, I will do this x + x = so much. It’s very simple, how do you love. Do you sit down and make a picture, now I’m going to love my child, so I will make a lap with this much angle and this much angle and the baby there at this angle, look at her with this angle, then I turn left right, then again I put the child this side. Do you do like that? 

You know how to love, don’t you? It’s built in. Surrendering is nothing but the love of God that is within you. He is within you in your heart. He is there. All the scriptures have said that and none of them are wrong or false. They might have listened to [UNCLEAR] somewhere, everybody has to play tricks. Our tantricas in India, all of these who are nowadays gurus were tantricas once upon a time, in the 6th century. They entered into all kinds of things. And the worst thing they entered into are the Vedas themselves, you see, where they declare that even I think, like Ashwamedhya [name needs to be checked] which is a very pure thing is also disoriented from sex.

Even they said that the God and the Goddess, the God and His power are sex relationships. Actually they think that human beings are nothing but sex points. They have nothing else in them. Even an ameba has something more than that. But we accept them. Why? Because we are seekers. We are simple. And we are seeking, we are born in this world to seek. We have taken our birth specially at this time so seek. We have been seekers all our lives and today we want to seek. And how are we going to seek? Wherever we get a chance we had to. I know it is hard to understand it, you don’t have to do anything, just sit right. The boat is moving and it will take you to the other end. You don’t have to do anything.

It was going to work out, this is how it has to mature. Now the flowers are there, they attract the bees, the bees come at the right time, they blossom at the right time and also the fruits appear at the right time. It has to mature. It has to take its own course and time. The way you are built in, you are made it has to complete itself, so the another round starts. And that’s why this [UNCLEAR] has blossomed today. That’s all, nothing more than that. It is very easy to correct. There is no problem about it. It’s very easy, because once you have [UNCLEAR] you start seeing everything very very clear, because there is no light it becomes so difficult. Have you tried climbing up steps without lights in any new house which you have not been? Three times you fall down before you get over one, like that. But if there is light, whatever type of the house ready, wherever you have been, you can just go up. Just like that. In the same way, unless and until you are enlightened, unless and until you are realized, unless and until you have that power poured into you, you cannot understand and you cannot see that how simple it is. And you are so beautifully built in your previous searches, that once you get this awakening within you, you start awakening others. Immediately and you can start it also [UNCLEAR]. But you see just now it’s such a powerful thing, that most of them have got it, so I don’t know where [UNCLEAR]. Most of them have got it. Sometimes it happens like that, whom are we going to raise now, Mother everybody is realized.

[Shri Mataji laughing and Yogis talking]

She’s got it too. You see that’s the problem. That it is [UNCLEAR]  but you will find that it will settle down again. It has to go back because we have got chakras within us, the centers, which are being exhausted. That I would say, now this side is the left side and this side is the right side. And both sides are the sympathetic nervous system. Right side sympathetic nervous system works for your mental being and for your emotional being, mental being and for your physical being, the left side for your emotional being. In-between is the central path, is the para sys. Now the underline subtle energies that control these two, left and right, the left one is controlled by the power which we call as Mahakali swarupa, which is, when the hrim and the kleem. The hrim is the central power, ra is energy, hrim is the one which gives you evolutionary powers and also sustenance. Like carbon had its own sustenance, and gold has its own sustenance, as you have your own sustenance. Everybody has the sustenance through this central power of hrim, is the power of Mahalakshmi. And the right hand-side power is the power of Mahasaraswati.

Now you shouldn’t get upset, it resides within. It has nothing with any particular community or anything, because these were found out by Saints who were meditating in India and they read Sanskrit language. That’s why they are Sadhus. Moreover these days also science has developed here, but also in India a kind of a science [UNCLEAR] and the science that was developed in India was the science of Kudalini, is the force of the germinating power, the residual power within us. And this science has seen or has actually experiment with the movement of the Kundalini when it moves, the sounds take place. And these sounds are different on different centers within us, which are seven basics, but there are 11 otherwise and there are three

[Shri Mataji talking with Yogi]

350, this is the thing, 350 million, but [UNCLEAR] only with seven [UNCLEAR]. Not more than that. It’s too much of ending. Why should you [UNCLEAR]. We need not worry, now you are sitting [UNCLEAR], it’s perfectly alright. Why should you worry from where this electricity has come. And from how much of drops it must have taken to create this much of electricity. Is it from the water or from the coal or what is the history, whose bother. You just put on the light and enjoying. They are ready for you. It’s all done. In this also you must take it for granted that it’s all done for you and you have every right to happened.

So this Kundalini, when it passes through all these various chakras it makes a sound. And that sound has been taken by those people in the ancient days as the phonetics, phonetic sounds for forming the Sanskrit language. That’s why Sanskrit is used for controlling the Kundalini, the movement of the Kundalini. And the centers that are within you have got a mark, a land mark of your evolution.  For example, the leaders who came at different stages of your evolution where actually the incarnations of Divine power and they have left a mark within you and they exist within you at that particular center. So when you say a particular mantra that deity opens out and starts emitting energy. But still human being without realization is a limited energy. These deities have limited energies. But if he is put in connection with the All-pervading power through realization, then these deities are also [UNCLEAR]. Like if you have a car and you [UNCLEAR] petrol and the petrol shop is there, then you put the car into tension and you know what to do. But supposing there is a permanent pipe on the cap of the patrol tank, which is filling is permanently then you don’t have tensions. You are not bothered what is exhaustion. Now this exhaustion on all the centers, because these are the underlying forces of all the plexuses that we have outside. When they get exhausted, plexuses that are active in our body, our mind, our thinking, our emotional activities, all of them get exhausted and then we develop diseases of various types. Physical, mental, emotional.

So to make these centers awakened is a very important thing even from a day to day life stand point, like you must fill them up, you must awaken them so that at least your health is alright, your wealth is alright, you mind is alright, and also your emotions are alright. This is the basis.

But ultimately what do you get? Ultimately you get that connection which is all the time [UNCLEAR]. Not only that much like unless and until you get this connected to the main you cannot work it out. Maybe very nicely made what to do then. So the first thing is put it to the mains. When you put it to the mains then only you will realize where is the problem. Otherwise you will not know. But when you get your self realization you know your problems. [UNCLEAR] That is self realization, you know your centers how they are effected, where they are effected, what is the problem there and you get the power to cure.

Of course thoughtless awareness is there, no doubt but plus that immediately. A person who Kundalini has crossed Agnya, only Agnya, may not even get realization can cure others.  That’s how are are have half baked curing people. Mostly then they get possessed and they get spiritualists, you see. Their Kundalini only rises up to Agnya and some spirit comes into and he becomes spiritualist. But you people even if it crosses Agnya immediately you can start curing. When it crosses Sahasrara this point, the last point, then you enter into that area or into that subtle awareness which is all pervading.

Just now we think that you are different, she is different, she is different, but there’s a thread passing through. If your attention becomes that thread then you can pass into anyone. That’s how you know yourself, you know your problems, everything, you also know ours, immediately. That is what is the collective consciousness about which Jung also has integrated. So you have to expect collective consciousness that is, is an actualization. That is that you are consciousness, your awareness  get’s that dimension in actual form, that you become. To explain it I will tell you.

Like animals walking through dirt and filth they never feel any dirt of filth. They cannot see beauty. But we can. We cannot walk through dirt and filth, our awareness is very different from that of animals. In the same way when you become this then your awareness becomes so beautiful, that you start feeling the sin. You start feeling the wrong. I don’t have to tell you, you may not just do it. I don’t have to tell you. Automatically you started feeling what is good for you and what is bad. Say our [UNCLEAR] has not come. I never tell you don’t drink , you know I don’t, you go ahead, have cancer and have everything nicely, then comfortably, have your liver absolutely shattered, you are a drunken fellow, then live comfortably. Alright doesn’t matter. Then the realization takes place, immediately the priorities change within you. Absolutely. Will be amazed I have seen people who have been terrible drunkards, you see. They said, Mother we can’t help it. I said, what happened? We vomit. Same thing happened with Rustom. He started vomiting and he couldn’t take, you see, anger.

Then you just enjoy something else, because if you get the nectar of life then you don’t run after frivolous things, useless thing. Your dignity becomes different. You become different. It’s entirely different. Your sense of enjoyment is so different. You become really beautiful flowers and the fragrance people can see from a distance, even from a telephone. It’s so dynamic. And that is what it should happen. For that what should we do? You can say, Mother what should we do? Nothing, just ask. You have to ask me and knock. That’s all. Even if you do not knock your Mother is going to knock at your doors. She is very persuasive, she will come to your house. Make you comfortable, she will massage your body, she will massage your head, she will massage your back, work on you and she see to it that she takes you out. She has too much patience. And you will be amazed, that if I am tired I feel better 17:13

The things that were going to happen because the spirits, and he knew that what was going to happen by those things happening, he would then be able to manipulate you see this is the power of the spirits coming on but he doesn't know bone by bone. He doesn't know. What he's done is not going to be perfect. It's not going to be perfect. All of them in how they do that. It was mm mm. Because I don't think he realised, I mean, he's lost that realisation to realise the possibilities something like that's the that's the advantage. That's a very big advantage that any anything has been try goes you get. Just what you know and then you just do not get any report with yourself. You just don't understand.

That's where you have According to Parliament. No guru, no teacher can be either involved in pain. Women and money not be involved. Yes, sex wise I'm talking about cannot be involved. Of course not. And they all are involved in those things, you see, actually, I mean, if you want, I was reading that. You see You get detached in the sense you become the personality. You're a detached personality. You don't know what strength is. You don't know what is.

It comes to you, you may become famous, it's a different one, but you don't know what his feeling. Just don't care, you know, you just don't care. The person who is truthful also understands, but the one who is realised, the one who is going to be the world is the who is the one who just doesn't care for it. He doesn't come into. I'll give you an example. I don't talk about that. There was one very rich man and his sister was um with cancer and they said, OK, we be in the hospital. I got you. I had a very interest. Yeah, it's time to do one, you must help me and uh more, but how you you so much money to have a national.

Mhm We talked to this, uh, my first he said doctor I don't understand much about it. He said, no, no, I will do this, and we went to talk to this, uh, the guy, and he said that he his work and that, but I have 11. So How she accepts the what is the problems. He said that my wife is a person, uh, she's possessed, she's got cancer and she's such as such, and, uh, I work done. And if she says that it is, yes, it is like that to my wife, then I can have a divorce and I get divorce, uh, I get a lot of money myself, but just now we are there all these problems are. You see someone tried to make this. So very serious it's a right. about what is right. I said I don't want see his wife, but the rest of the time I see what it is like. So that she, she, her name was Patricia.

I must say Patria see is space. It's Great And she was herself a bit. She came on a plane to down there was such a. Not that Mark was bad. No, he was also a good person, but some dirty woman must have come in between. He and you all have such funny ideas. You must change your wives, like, like American people are, you must change your fridge and you must change your room. We must change your wives. The change is the sign according to them of progress. So what do we do?

So I think something like that maybe, but it was very serious allegation about racing. She was such a fine person. So and then she, yeah she went off to the back and he came to see me and he said, Mother, what do you think about her? I said, she's one of the finest American woman and. She's a very devoted wife and don't go near them. They have a power of their own, and I will not touch her by anything. And also she said, Mother, do you think she's, uh, she's, uh, not cous? I said, not a do you maybe, but she's not. What about, uh, what about cancer? I said she told her, and there's no possibility of her getting injured.

She's a very devoted wife. She's a very nice person, and she loves you. And if you try, uh, to have a divorce with her, you'll be a very miserable person. Just don't, it's not at all good for you as a mother, I'm telling you that if she's my daughter and I'm proud of. Oh, his face fell down, so I'm really. So I said, see, really angry. I have to tell it. And I was Chand why he said, Mother, you have no, uh, pragmatic approach. What pragmatic. I don't understand the word.

He said it should be practical. I said, what practical? They said that you see he's willing. Why don't you say that, but I said, how come it's a look, right? I says. I said tell them why do you know if there's an innocent person and if you ban an innocent person like this. You live on me. I would never do that. But even if you do that, it's a very great sal which you cannot fill up by giving realisation to 100 million to set the value up to? I said, yes, now will you do it.

I'm also, you see, after all, an Indian man, you see, no, no, no, no, I'm not. We are going out. It's a mark. Don't talk to me. I'm going back if she is a woman like that. What you say I'm I like that the whole down. Don't. What are we going to do with these buildings. I have to ask you why the human one. The temples are to be built of human beings and not of houses which are going to come to the house.

We have to keep living. Uh, images, not these things by which people are impressed for the time being, and then when you die, they say that I never take them. Such a person cannot, you see, it just does not work. Same about fame, you see what is fame? It's nonsense. What is a fame? What is the pain? Just tell me. I don't never understand. Do you understand?

What is fame is what is it? Fame, if it means somebody says, oh, you're great, you're great, run away from that. Because you think they may be wanting something out of you. They want to use you. Normally none of the incarnations got pay they. They got only stones and prescriptions. None of them got. Yeah, but there's only one way soba is going to do that because you're going to get actualization. You're going to get the experience of it. That's why in your heart.

God is going to decide anyway. This is the way. If you call it the same, I accept that it should be so if that sort of fame is that you feel that now you see that. Yearning for the person is the fame which comes out of auspiciousness. You know, auspiciousness is a thing that is a quality in personality by which you improve in your, in your, uh, everything in the success, not this worldly success, but success that is satisfying. 3 means the grace that is beautifying. Such a person is auspicious and such a person would have a kind of a thing which which is very different from EDM styles. And the world is going to change, you see. They are not going to have Lord Byron for a statue. No, they're not, or Wellington is not going to be, uh, then we are going to have something else.

People are going to change this awareness is going to change completely. They are going to care for people who have that eternal. They're not going. Yeah Hi, good, good, but, I think, uh, when we were all talking about this for rules, you don't understand, I think one thing that's. The sin against the Holy Spirit is the worse than all the worst of the sin. She's very simple to understand supposing somebody beats you, won't mind if somebody beats me, will you be able to do it in your heart? The same way Christ has said, it's all right if you insult me, but if you insult my mother, I'm going to be right on your throes. There are 11 powers in this spot by which he's going to control such people. It's very simple to understand. OK That's what You have to insult the mother of Christ.

It's really dangerous. That's why he never told anybody that she was the Holy Spirit. She was the holy ghost. That's why I didn't say because that was a protective thing. Did she what? Ask a question. She Maria, are you busy on the cooking. Well I just finished. Well she's so sweet. She's working so hard.

Will you please go on. It's very logical, isn't it? It's very logical. I mean, if he's your son and, and if he's the son of God, then you must be God. But I wonder why people don't sort of see that, you know. See, that's the trouble. They can see something they can, you cannot see. This is my this is. You see something which does not exist, and you do not see that exists, this illusion, it's the illusion. If you can.

Get to see into that state. From where you see the illusion you just enjoy the just now as you are laughing at just now when it's a big joke, you know. I was also there. I was out there. Yes, but this is how this is how this is how the whole of Maya because you got beyond that you agree that I, I do not blame you for that at all. So you are the crucified ones. How to expose that, you see, this is the trick of the fire if you understand it, the plague stomach. See, now you cannot kill them like that, see, because they have entered into your head, see, so now how do I do it. Is to put you there. You, you go into them, you see them and then you get out of it and it would be with a greater force and with greater immunity from these horrible.

You know, Marty said something very funny when we were. Uh, in September we were, uh, he was talking about a story from the, from the Crown. It's about the ramen who. Who had rice. Uh, he went to this king's palace. Um, on his way out, he stole some jewellery, and they couldn't understand why he stole the jewellery because there was the saint and he stole his jewellery. They discovered eventually the food that he had eaten came from a village of thieves. He returned the jewellery and then he said, he, he said the story looking at me, you see, and afterwards he walked out. Because we'd just about 2 hours before been discussing this question of the money they asked what they've done. And he said to me as he walked out, You see?

And it was only 4 months later that I actually saw what he was getting at. He was apologising for his own, for his, for his own deeds, and he then said that people, people in this room who are going to bring down the movement, not that way, but he was trying to say these things and all that just to show you that uh I know what you're talking about. Is and. See, I mean, I, I have to dictionary. I don't understand what to say. I have no words to say what sort of a man. You should really get somebody from Lucknow. These are nice abusers that they use for such people. If you want, I can write to someone write about 21 of them and you send it back. This is this, this is this you are, and this is the mantra you say about yourself that I'm always, you know, I will tell him you cannot imagine what sort of a man he.

We had one like that, but openly he was like you see once, uh, we had a very great swindler in great swimmer. His name was. I don't know where he learned that swindling, but, uh, he met Jahalaji in. And in these matters our prime minister was very nice. He was very fond of people who were very properly dressed in a very busy English manner and they spoke good English and they had all the English. I mean he was Cambridge we should say super. So that kind of a thing our prime minister was very much interested. So this fellow went and told him that I'm a doctor. I'm this and all, and also our prime minister, they say so I'm not, I don't know, but that he had, he, he could appreciate a good looking woman very much. So his wife was a very good looking woman, as they say.

I have seen I've seen this horrible fellow. And he managed it somehow and then when he went back to India. Uh, that time I'm telling you that I had gone to see my husband there. And you know, for us they allow us to sit inside the lounge and came out and I saw this man with a big hat over hat. So I had to ask my husband, who is this man? He said, Why do you want to do? I said, but you tell me who is this man. I was, he said, Why are you so childish to them? I said, I'm not childish. I'm anxious to.

So he said, uh, all right, I'll tell him his name. His name is Ram, and I said, What is he doing there? He says, why do you want to know about him? Of all the questions, why he, I said, because he's going to talk. Really, it's like God. I said, what is he connected with you? He said you very much. I said, how he's coming for shipping. So then, uh, you know what happened that, uh, this fellow went to Joharali and the wife would have a breakfast today and then she used to order a bot this and that and you know Jaharalji was another, uh, as I told you a very nice person, he never understood that this was a. Then he was given from that war.

Can you imagine 65 rows of Good. But my husband, as soon as this proposal came up, he put down his book because I was after his life, so they transferred him, they transferred him and they gave him a bigger post and they said you become chairman of the big corporation with this transfer. And they, they gave him 65 lakhs of peace and the parliament passed it and our prime minister also was in a 65 rules were passed and then he got ships and so-called ships and. She did all the uh big big uh sort of uh shipyards and all that. Never paid them anyone. He ordered the ships. He talked to the delivery and every time he took prime minister there, I think another is, uh, another, uh, deputy prime minister who is nowadays our prime minister, the great fellow, you see, the one, the one who drinks the English. This this side, this side, you see we have lots of buttons, you know. He took them there and this fellow, this side was the one who inaugurated and big this thing and naturally you see the poor shipyard people the Hitachi and all these people who build ships't say anything because the Prime Minister, the deputy prime minister coming in Garland did this that, and he's going to launch the ship. They launched the ship and this fellow never gave them the money.

The ship was launched permanent. It out there and they had no way of collecting it. And these are the two great people of our country, can you imagine the one who is today the prime minister and the one who was. And they gave him 65 ks of. Now, my, uh, this happened and then suddenly the whole thing started coming up just like this and then one man, he found it out and he leaked it to the government and he leaked it to the police and all that and then suddenly my husband was in, uh. No, he was in Japan. And he suddenly gave me. I said, how just a terrible thing that's happening here. I said, what? Then, uh, they told me that this man was supposed to have killed his first wife and they took her money and then come to India and did this and that and that and that and people are after and because of this thing, it started off, you see, they found out also about shipping and these two great giants of our country, what should I call them, you see, they were saying, you see, don't harass them.

The police is very bad. Don't harass them, and they were supporting him. But it was simple. They didn't take any money from him, I said, but then this man was absolutely gone, and then he one day just ran away from it again to some place in Pana from where we couldn't could not have any. The whole thing was hashed out and all these ships were frozen. All his money was frozen. They still we managed to take away the a 4 colours of, but this, uh, the best part of it, my husband says very seriously to me. And do you know that ₹250 that you have to pay for registration, that also this uh tug did not pay. Even that he did not pay and our great people like Jaharan and Muraji, the greatest supporters of him, so you shouldn't feel bad about what has happened. You see, it is.

And then he was arrested. He was, he, he came to London. London was came to London. The case was filed in London. I He was telling stories after stories. Jalaji had died by that, you see, he became absolutely dark and he died in a horrible condition in old age. He got a shock on his life, but he did such a foolish. So he went out. If you see his old age photograph, he looks like a gas person so. And then this, uh, this case started in London and then he, he said another drama he played, he said, you see these people are all against Javalaji to take back to being there to all playing and this and that.

And the judge was listening to him. I just said now I'm finished, he said, now I see that you are a crook of the first bottles and you are a tug and you are this and you are that and now will you shut up. That's what they said and it. I said that's the way you said. And he said you take 2 running jumps and go to him. These are the words he used. And then he was in jail. He came out of the jail, and then Indira Gandhi, the great, you see, another great lady we had, prime minister, she saw to him that he goes out of. Now he's up. So are we not sufficiently looted?

Do you want more examples. It's a fact, you see, so, uh, imagine people like that, and the, and I would not even blame Jawar Laji for this because he had such a big, uh, secretariat with the best the cream of our country, the most intelligent people, all the intelligence of India was behind this, and they all did it in good faith, you see, the good faith part. And none of them got a single pie. Hello, how are you? Yes, yes, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. Very nice children there. Come along, come along, come along. I'm just waiting for you to come down here. Come along, come along, sit down. Sit down, sit down.

Oh. What This tremendous. They brought the post for me. hello. Mm, see, I mean this is what it is. Can you see, can you feel them? Can you feel the vibrations? Well I just see this great. They'll do the job for me. I don't have to say.

It's Please put your hands also like, all of it. Just like. It's also. See now, you feel some cool? Mhm. Yes, good. Mhm. OK. Are you feeling all right there? All of you? Are you feeling the cool breeze?

What he? Have more of it and more of it. Let it go inside. Absolutely Oh You've got gold. Gmail.com. I get it. Mm. See, you've already got the help. So I should do I So many of you are born in this country. I will find it. 

Be enough? Feeling better, better now. And the best thing is you must know the know-how. Otherwise you are not to believe anything. Why should you not believe anyone who doesn't tell you anything? No. They call it science. Do you know, do you have anything, I mean, any knowledge of science about which you have, you don't have to know how? In even everything. On it.

Maria's house is blessed many a times. It's beautiful. Mm. Oh I have That I. OK, stop it. Why don't you sit down, Bala. OK, if the chair people can go back, then others can sit in between all those who are occupying chairs should go to the back. Better idea. So that those who can sit in front, you see. Is this sofa could be pushed a little bit this side. Um.

Thank you Hello. Come, we have had a very nice session of great laughter something like talking about, uh, Charlie Chaplin. This I Hopefully he brought my eye. I have my my chapels that's. I think you should put this chest down at the back so that they can see you are all right, just yeah, mm. Did you, did you turn up or would you like? Hello hello. Yeah No. Just come, just come. We have been having a big laughter.

Yes, she's upstairs. We just brought his, brought his wife. This is your daughter. I don't think what's up to, but she's recognised roots and photographs. She's doing this with her glasses. smaller. She points out. Go, go, go, go. The train from Glasgow is late. Sorry it's too late.

All right, you're never late with me. Can you sit on the ground? Oh yeah, very much so. So all the quorum is complete? All of that. There are people from. They, they, they have brought the real force, see all of them, yeah, they have brought the forces. Just sit like this, just like this. I'm not. I I'm still on Monday that there's gonna be 10 people.

One of my friends have the line the line. Are you feeling? You've got it already. See, it's awesome. What about you? See, right, just wash my hands you see that. Yes What about you? Are you feeling this pain? Not yet? Just now you will know if it is there.

No, no sort of feel everything no. Mm. Yeah We've been just laughing about all the things this year now. and how they have cheated all of us and all that oh God, and now we know, and now, now we, we have to decide and plan out how we are going to outfit all of that, so it's plan we have to work it out. Mm Yeah Oh Mm mm. I think he's. Just to be settled down and experience which is to be settled down. We could only rises at the first there's no basic problem. I mean, I would say that as I have told you before, but I, I couldn't give the address to the person. So with the foreigners, so there's something special about you that your own motherland is giving you that problem.

And it is spontaneous, it is very fruitful, and it does happen. But then it settles back. In a sense, it has to look after all the centres. And all the problems that you've had. So it comes down then you start thinking about it. That's the point. You cannot think about it. You didn't get it by thinking this one thing you must know that you did not get it by. You got it because it was to happen. So if you think about you will reach, you cannot think it is love.

What can you think about love. It's not science. And just now if you watch your eye, watch yourself, you are beyond us, most of you, the thought. Why? Done it. Are you too close to that? You do not. You can put it off. I think just, just a light, is it yeah. Mhm.

Are you feeling the colds nicely. The same place. Good. So let's talk of something nice now. Let's talk about, yes, let's have something about the about the light. All right, we talked about the massage pretty much. Right Oh. So. I. Yes.

Oh OK. I was going to bring her because she has been initiated into but I. But perhaps you can look at that. They're not very new but she's about a year older now. That one's. What did you say she has TM. I And uh. She's about a year old, she's, so that was last. She got dramas. Mhm mhm.

the right heart you also can feel yeah that's dramas you see this is ramas so I will tell you about the. Uh, so I would have to. Tell you about Yeah Ourselves, what are we? Actually we know so little about ourselves. This ignorance is responsible for this kind of problem that you all have faced because you're so ignorant about and the reason is the knowledge about what I'm going to tell you, you can only have when you are. Without that, one cannot talk about it and one cannot explain to you because it is too fantastic. It's so fantastic that you cannot believe it, and you cannot accept it, and that's why it is not uh for the human mind to conceive, it goes beyond. If I say That There is God's divine love. Which is the most dynamic power. Which is the only power.

That Guides this situation. That Coordinates everything that looks after us and that has made us a human being. You won't believe it. That there is such a problem of God. All that you see other things is absolutely false. It's just a reflection, it's not the mirror. And this power. Then enter into every atom. Every molecule And can control all that. We see it every day, those things, but we take it for granted, like we see the flowers suddenly becoming the fruits.

How will they become? A mango tree will give you mangoes. It won't give you roses. How does it happen? You should see even in chemistry. That are created on this earth have a regular planning about it. They are divided into. Exactly 8 divisions. Now how all this happens? We never think about it, we take it for granted.

We try to find out what we see, what it is, and then we say, oh, we are the scientists. But you cannot say how it works. Even if you take a sulphur dioxide, an ordinary. Atom or sulphur, the sulphur atom. Is on top and there are 2 oxygen. If you see it under microscope, you can find out that it pulsates. And there's a kind of a vibration that's passing between these atoms, and these vibrations are of three types. Unequal equal dissimul. And who does that and how, why that certain act like this something act like that. Even the matter which is a dead thing, which we do not think is capable of having any energy in it, that's what we used to think now of course you have changed your ideas about that.

That too has such a beautiful arrangement. Even up to the molecular state. Up to the atom stage, you can see how it is mathematically arranged the protons and the neutrons around. It is just to see and wonder. Yeah And when you see it in the nature. And these elements. There atoms, then you see later on where do you start watching. Something much more complex, that is a living cell. With the carbon coming into it, we just take it for granted. We never bother to know from where did this carbon come?

And how with carbon combination life can we just take ourselves also for granted as if uh we are great kings and that whatever we have got our human life is our own, you see, sort of thing, and we think that if we, if we have this human body, it's our. Special right to have it. Even this eye of if you see such a complex camera. How it works instantaneously how it captures. It's something Beyond our comprehension, so we negate it. We don't see it's all right. We take it for granted. That's the way human beings live with it. See, if you cannot cope with the thing, then what we do is to accept it for granted and it. That's a sensible thing.

In the same way nature has made you especially in such a manner that you cannot hear certain frequencies, you can only hear certain frequencies. You are created with such beautiful adaptations to nature and surroundings. This earth is moving with such a tremendous speed you do not feel. It is spinning round so fast you cannot feel. We take all this for granted. And we think we are human beings, but why are you human beings? Why have you become human beings? What can you find out? What did you find out so far? Whatever you can see, whatever is absolutely factual that you have found out, you have not been able to find out why these things happen and how these things.

How are you going to find out about such a complex thing that human beings? You have become a human being without doing anything about it. And what are you going to do? For getting that awareness by which you are going to know yourself. Yeah. Nothing whatsoever. On the contrary, effort. Human beings food because they have a sense that they can put in effort. But you reach a certain stage later on that you feel you are putting more effort. It's just working out.

You're just sitting down very nicely and the whole thing is working out. Say for example. There is a relay in London. About some programmes. In the tee. Now, it's all in the atmosphere. You don't see it. And suddenly you start your tea. What effort have you put in? It was all built in there.

And it was all Whatever was done on the other end was also done by somebody. You have just put on the switch, and you get. Pictures which you do not see normally on the walls nowhere but some you get they are there. But you believe into it because this you are seeing with your own eyes. It is an actual thing. That's why you believe into it, and that's why you must believe into it when it's an actual. So we come to that position where we understand that if anyone talks about higher life. About the power beyond this, then we must have actualization of. You must be. At this point there's a problem.

Because it is easy to talk about this. That there is a higher life, there's God and His power working and all that, all this lecture you can hear from many people. Even actualization of it, you see, they may say that jumping like a frog is actualization. Yes, we have had people like that, you know, in one of my lectures there was a gentleman who was both his feet towards me and. I said Uh, it's all right for me. But I don't know what's going to happen to this gentleman, and then one of the boys went and said, you're not supposed to sit like this to a mother. She said, you see, I'm sorry, but if I sit in any other form, I cannot sit. I start jumping like a rock. Mhm. So I think How do you uh think that this is uh.

This happens, happens every time. And if I do it now, it will start like that. So I said, uh, but, uh, why did that happen? because my kundalini has a reason. I'm a self relaxed person. Who has told you this? He took out a big book like that won't believe such a big book, and he showed me written down there that when Kundalini rises, you start jumping like a frog. Who is this gentleman? This is some Aarya Rama, some some sort of a name, such a big name, you see, and horrible person's photograph on everything, such a big, big book, and this fellow is carrying on his head all the time, jumping at a frog. He says that yes, you have to jump like a.

So I asked him, now when you are going to evolve, are you going to become a frog? Or a monkey. What are you going to be? This is. You can use your brains for this to understand what to. Expect, see? You're not going to become like monkeys or pigs. Or even lies. You're already the highest and you have to be something higher. So that rules it out.

Then the fellow says another one he came to me. And he says the best was we had one from. Uh, let me out, is that? This is David. He's our surgeon. He's very sweet and otherwise for him. Yeah I think he came yesterday. And uh I said, what happened, David? What were you doing like this and why did you do all these things after coming to surgery? He said there must be some devil on me.

But he said, Mother, he was so subtle, one of the subtlest ones you should understand that he told me that you are this and this and that you will give me realisation that I should. It came in my ears. Can you imagine to that extent. And so he believed in that kind of a spirit, and he was carrying on with it. But I said, for telling you this, why should you use any spirit? You can eat it in time out. Use your brains. Then we have another one where we think we can uh purchase in the market, you see there are courses of loan 3 weeks course, 33 years course for shaving off all your property. So We go in, you see for that. Then all such things one must understand cannot be anywhere reality.

So what should we expect? What should we react? What we call of knowledge of self. First, science has given us certain thing which we should try to understand. And if you understand food science, you can understand. That Science has given us. And understanding That That is a farmer. Which we cannot comprehend through our rationality. Even a person like Einstein says that I could not find the theory of relativity in the laboratory. I was tired.

I was lying down and I was playing with, uh, soap bubbles. I me playing with soaps, and suddenly the whole theory of relativity dawned upon me. Because he was realised so. So it has not come from laboratories, these people themselves are saying. So whatever knowledge has come to us has not come to so-called scientific research, but through the grace of some power. Science cannot explain many. For example, The science. That I know but the the. yeah, for a day that guy is very bad. He's not well and that's why he's upset all the other children are all right.

But she was in a bar. So. yeah For example, So very sweet. They. Uh, cannot say. Why? So many things happen in the human body. For example, It is said that Any foreign body that enters in the system creates a situation by which the body tries to throw it up. But it's only the foetus. Which is Retained in the womb, nurtured and looked after and thrown away at a time when the thing is absolutely magic.

So there is somebody who thinks about it. Then there are 2 Chemicals, chemicals there, adrenaline and acetically which are secreted in our being at different points. And they cannot explain how these ordinary chemicals sometimes augment it constraint and sometimes at different ones. They cannot explain it, so they will say they are honest, so they say the mode of action of these chemicals in the human body cannot be explained. They behave differently from their own nature. Sobala from their old age. There are many such things which I can quote to you and show you that man reaches a point where he thinks that there is something else that takes the decision. Now when you reach that stage. Then you start thinking. That through science, we feel that there is something that we cannot explain and that rationality could cannot take it out there.

So there must be some answer to it. The answer comes from psychology. I would say you was one of the greatest psychologists ever. Yeah, was Freud, because Freud, you know, was a horrible psychologist. He was a fellow who was treating all kinds of abnormality. He never treated normally. So he got possessed by that, you see, and he started behaving abnormally. He Himself was a very abnormal person. He had very abnormal relationships, and he was really absurd. His own lifetime, and he had a very bad death.

He had cancer. He died, but still all of the Western world worships. They never see what he achieved in his own lifetime, what sort of a person he was, what was his relationship with other people, and how he did. He was very anxious, always taking pills, and he died of a terrible cancer and in a very wretched condition, he died. While you In his old age, he got his realisation, and he was of a very different nature and when he died, he used to look, he was looking like a flower. But people do not see all that. They just see what he writes, and because it suits them to listen to Freud, I don't know why it suits them actually it should not normally. So Mr. Freud has come, and I would say you, if you want, you'll find out that this great man. Has done so many experiments with thousands of people. And has established.

And has established that there are. Forces beyond that. Forces beyond us which control. And the forces beyond us to control us. He called them as universal unconscious. Unconscious because they are not in the unconscious. And he called them as also. As uh. See, he, he actually, uh, did not know how to name it, so he said that he has said. It is the mother's course.

It's a motherly very clearly I said, and he studied Indian also Indian literature and all that, and he has. Uh, developed some thought on hati also, so he has used the word ha for the universal unconscious, but still he was just to realise so there was no mother to tell him all about what it was, so he could only indicate and tell you that there is a universal unconscious. Which is guiding them. He experimented with people with their dreams. There's a very famous dream which he interpreted about a man who would always dream that he has to bow to his own son. His son is sitting on a pedestal and he has to bow. The sun might be a real realise. So he came to him and he said, I don't know why I get such a dream. So you asked, what is your relationship with your son? He's very, very bad.

I said why? He said, I'm, see, his mother is dead. I'm married again, and my wife is very happy with it, and I really don't know what to how to manage it. The relationship has gone very bad. So he said the unconscious is telling you that you must bo. Pleases of higher awareness, so you must. It is giving you a bag. There was another girl who came to him with a drink, I mean, to just to put two drinks together after him. He said that I see my mother as a witch. So he asked, what is your relationship with your mother?

She said it's very fast, very good. She actually pampers me. She has pampered me so much that I'm just good for nothing. He said that is the thing that is coming to you from your unconscious to suggest that your mother is a witch who is spoiling you. And there are 100 1 like that, you see, there are so many volumes of. Which you can read for yourself. So the psychologists have told us that the state of human awareness would reach at a point when he will be thoughtlessly aware. He will be aware, but there won't be any thought. This is said by you who was a psychologist, so we should know what we have to expect. Now there's another source which is very clear, and really, really good.

Which we can understand are the scriptures. If you read John's revelation, you can read about all this. We know that the. Who wins this to go. If you read Shankaracharya, of course I will not say much more because he's the one who has completely exposed the whole thing in the 6th century. This knowledge was a secret knowledge before that because the evolutionary forces had not taken its proper course. It was kept a secret knowledge, a guarded knowledge for very few. Only in the 6th century he started exposing it in Kavida in Nanaka. All these people came out with full exposition of. The greatest work done on Kundalini was in Maharashtra.

Where the nine natas, the primordial masters they call themselves, worked on it. And also in other places they also came from Punjab. There was a big rapport between Punjab and Maharashtra and they went into the forest, meditated, and religiously tried to find out what was, what was the force? What was the seed with us? What was the germinating force that is going to give us this? Because one or two were realised whenever they talked about realisation, nobody could believe them and could understand that there is a force like that, and they said, Oh, peacekeepers, we are happy with ourselves. Moreover, the people who were realised had such bad experiences of all these people like they were beaten up. You see 5. The poisoned I mean imagine What was there to crucify Christ? I still can't understand.

So the very sensible people of this world. Looked at all the explanations about God and divinity with that kind of a hostile. Uh, I. And there was no way of changing this attitude of this. And this hostility was expressed even by religious organisation. You see, anybody who has a realised so was thrown away from churches, from temples. These Brahmins killed, they tortured them. The last one that we had was the shiva, and if you see how the Brahmins from, uh, Nagar, uh, area, from Mummed, how they tortured him, you'll be surprised. Not only that, but they brought a snake charmer with a snake to kill, but he got hold of the snake and he talked to the snake. The snake went away and.

With the job. Then he was the one who got up and saved the child. And he told him, don't do all this. He said, I would not, but people who have. So the people who were supposed to be in charge of religion themselves. Crucify those same problem of reality and that's how reality was completely blinded. Nobody could see it and people will get. This was the problem. And that's why somebody had to come and do this. To give a mass realisation to people so that it becomes a common knowledge.

Everything that is discovered by one person has to become the common knowledge, otherwise it has to mean, even in the science, you see, you find out about electricity. It has a big history behind it, whatever it is, but at a point it has to become a common knowledge. If it is not a common knowledge, it will never be accepted, and it has no value at all. It has to become a knowledge of every human being, otherwise it has no meaning, and the time has come for you to have the actualization. And to have the complete knowledge of your being, what you are, what you are going to be, what you could have been, what are the problems around. So in us is placed the germinating force. We are all built it. It's like a competent, absolutely living competence within us is placed through our evolution one by one, step by step all these points have been properly put down in our backbone, in our brain, and in the limbic area here, absolutely in a perfect man. And the only thing that one has to do is to Surrender To accept, but we surrender to all kinds of nonsensical things, but to the right person, who will immediately stand up. If somebody has two horns, it is very easy to say.

Or if somebody is very cunning, very easy to say. But where do you surrender is to the divine force, to yourself, to your wisdom. What do you surrender is your nonsensical idiotic ego. What do you have to surrender to God? What do you have? Only this non-knowledge which has come to be ego or sometimes through these positions which is. No, for salary. People think, how can I say? No, you cannot think about it. How should I surrender?

Can you work it out on a paper? I will do this X + X is equal so much. It's very simple. How do you laugh? Do you sit down and make a picture now? I'm going to love my child, so I will make a lap with this much angle and this much angle and the baby there at this angle. Look at her with this angle. Then I'll turn left right, and then I then I put the child this side. Do you do like that? You know how to laugh, don't you?

This building Seedary is nothing but is now. Of God that is within. He is within you in your heart. He's there. All the scriptures have said that, and none of them are wrong or false. They might have misinterpreted somewhere else. Everybody has great tricks, you see. Our Tanrikas in India, all these who are nowadays gurus of Tanrikas once upon a time in the 6th century, they entered into all kinds of things, and the worst thing they entered into are the Vedass themselves, you see, where they declared that even a thing like Ahomi there, which is a very pure thing. He's also oriented from sex. Mhm Even they said that the god and the goddess, God and His power are sex relationships.

I They think human beings are nothing but sex parts. They have nothing else in there? Even an amoeba has something more than that. But we accept them. Why? Because we are seekers. We are And we are sick. We are born in this world to see. We have taken our blood, especially at this time to see. We have been seekers all our lives, and today we want to seek it.

And how are we going to see? Where will we get a chance to. I know. It is hard to understand that you don't have to do anything, just sit right. The boat is moving And it will take you to dollars and don't have to do anything. It was going to work out. It it has to match. Now, the flowers are there, they tried the bees. The bees come at the right time. They blossom.

Uh, at the right time, uh. And Also the fruits appear at the plant. It has to match. It has to take its own course and time. The way you are building, the way you are made, it has to complete, so that another round starts, and that's why this hurry up has That's all. Nothing we done that. And it is very easy to correct. There's no problem about it. It's very easy, but once you have light, we start seeing everything very, very clear. Because there is no light, it becomes so difficult.

Have you tried climbing up steps without lights in a new house which you never? 3 times you fall down before you get over one light. But if there is light, whatever type of the house ready whenever you are, you can just go like this. In the same way, unless and until you are enlightened, unless and until you are realised, unless and until you have that power flowing through you, you cannot understand and you cannot see that how. And you're so beautifully built in your previous. That once you get this awakening within you, you start awakening this immediately and you can start it on somebody else, but you see, just now it's such a powerful thing that most of them have got it, so I don't know where I'm going to try. That's the problem. Most of them have got, so sometimes it happens like that. So who are we going to raise now everybody's realising. You can do something to me.

You can do that to anybody. She's got it too, you see, that's the problem that it is so powerful, but you'll find that she's setting down. It has to go back because we have got chakras within as the centres which are being exhausted. Like I would say now this side is the left side and this is the right side, and both sides are the sympathetic nervous system. The right side sympathetic nervous system works for your mental being and for emotional mental being and for your physical being and the left side for your emotional. In between is the central part is the past. Now the underlying subtle energies that control these two left and right. The left one is controlled by the power which we call as Mahakalism. Which is I When the rim and the cleans the ring in the central power ra ra is energy. Ram is the one which Gives you evolutionary powers and also sustain us like carbon has its own suspicion sustain us and like gold has its own sustainance as you have your own sustainance.

Everybody has to sustain us through this central power of green. Is the power of. And the right hand side power is the power of masses. Now you shouldn't get upset with the SAS. It has nothing to do with any particular community or anything because these were found out by saints who were meditating in India and in the Sanskrit language. That's why there are sa. Moreover, these names of. Science, you see, has developed here, but also in India a kind of a science and the science that was developed in India was the science of Unal is the force of the germinating power, the residual power within us, and this science has seen or has actually experimented. With the movement of the kundalini where it moves, the sound, and these sounds are different on different centres within us which are. 7 ACs, but there are 11 otherwise and there are 3, how much.

3 350. All right, so this is the, this is the thing, 350 million, but we deal only with 7 at the most, not more than that because it's too much offending. Why should do what? You need not worry. now you are sitting in this room. It's all right, perfectly well. Why should you worry from where this electricity has come? And for how many drops it must have taken to create this much of electricity? Is it, uh, from the water or from the core, or what is the history worst who's bothered? You just put on the like and enjoy.

That any It's all done. In this also, you must take it for granted that it's all done for you and you have every right to have it. So this kundalini, when it passes through all these various char, it makes a sound, and that sound has been taken by Those people in the ancient days as the phonetics, phonetic sounds for forming the facts of that. That's why Sanskrit is used for. Controlling the, the movement of the kar and the centres that are within you have got. A mark, a landmark. Of your evolution. For example, The leaders who came at different stages of your revolution. We actually the incarnations of divine power. And they have left a mark within you, and they exist within you at that particular set.

So when you say a particular mantra. That d opens up. And starts emitting. E But still, human beings without realisation is a limited. His deities have limited in it. But if he is put In connection with the all pervailing power through realisation in stating. Like if you have a car and you have a limited. Petrol, all right, and the petrol shortage is there too, then you are put intention and you do not know what to do. But supposing there is a. Permanent fight on you.

Uh, gap of the petrol tract, see, which is filling it permanently, then you don't have any tension. You are not bothered. What is exhausting? Now this exhaustion on all the centres, because these are the underlying forces of all the flexuses that we have outside. When they get exhausted, the plexuses that are acting our body, our mind. Our thinking, our. Emotional activities, all of them get exhausted and then we develop diseases of various types physical, mental. So to make these centres awake. It's a very important thing even from a day to day lifestyle like you must fill them up. You must awaken them so that at least your health is all right, your wealth is all right.

Your mind is all right and also your. Emotions This is the beast. But ultimately what do you get? Ultimately you get that connection which is all the time. Not only that much. Like unless and until you get disconnected to the means, you cannot work it up. It may be very nicely late what to do. So the first thing is put it to the mix. When you put into the maze, then only you will realise also where is the problem. Otherwise, you will not know.

But when you get self realisation. You know your problems. This is possible. That is selfish and you know your senses, how they are affected, where they are affected, what is the problem there, and you get the power to cure. Of course thoughtless awareness is there, no doubt, but plus that immediately. A person who's has crossedagia only may not even get ridization can cure us. That's how we have half half-baked curing people. So mostly then they get possessed and they get spirits. The kundalini only rises up to a gap and some spirit comes into that they becomes spiritual. But you people, even if it crosses immediately you can start you.

When it processes so. This point, the last point. Then you enter into that area. Or into that subtle awareness. Which is all for me. Just now we think that you are different, she's different, she's different. There's a thread passing through. If your attention becomes that thread, then you can pass into anyone. That's how though you know yourself, you know your problems, everything, you also know others immediately. That is what is the collective consciousness about which you also have indicated.

So you have to expect collective consciousness that is is an actualization that is that your consciousness, your awareness gets that dimension in actual form that you become to explain it. Like animals walking through dirt and they never feel any dirt or faith. They cannot see beauty, but who's that? We cannot walk through dirt. Our awareness is very different from that in the same way, when you become this, then your awareness becomes. So beautiful that you start. Feeling of the sick. You start feeling the wrong. I don't have to tell you. We will not just do it.

I don't have to take automatically. You started feeling what is good for you and what is bad. Say our son has not come. Uh, I, I never tell, don't drink like I'm. No, I don't. OK, you want it, have cancer. Have everything nicely then come to me. Have your liver absolutely shattered. Be a drunken fellow, then you come to me. All right, doesn't matter.

Then I realise it takes place. Immediately the priorities change. Absolutely. You'll be amazed. I've seen people who have been terrible drunkard, you see. They said, Mother, we can't clean. I said, what happens? We want it. Same thing happened with Trista, he started vomiting. And he couldn't take, you see, I never told him.

Then You just enjoy something else because if you get the nectar of life, then you don't run out of fruity. Useless things, your dignity becomes different. You become different. It's entirely different. Your sense of enjoyment is so different. become really beautiful flowers and the fragrance people can see from a distance, even from a telephone. It's so dynamic. And that is what it should happen. For that, what should you do? Because say mother what should we do nothing, just ask.

to ask, you have to know. That's all. Even if you do not knock, your mother is going to knock at your door. She's very persuasive. See Come to your house. Make you comfortable, massage your body, massage your head, massage your back and work on you. I see to it that she takes you out. She's too much patience. And you'll be amazed that if I'm tired, I feel better. Like because she came and she said, Mother, you do so much for us.

We've done so well, and that we, I must do something for her. She said, What can you do? She said, I'm very good at, uh, uh, massaging the feet. I said I I do it. So I was massaging my feet and her feet were massaged. And she couldn't understand this, and she was feeling relaxed, she was massaging my face. I said, what's happening? She said, it's not surprising. I'm getting relaxed while I'm massaging your. So that's what that you must know that it cannot be.

I'm here to take you are there to take. That's your right. It's your own. It's like a mother who loves such a lot and she has such a lot of properties. Everything is Just take Just See, the greatest pride for any mother should be. But she sees her children cry on her phone. Then they achieve their own power. Render water source. And there we come, the joyous, happy, blissful. She That's the way I see my dreams.

And I'm sure the time has come. I'm sure. I had to come to London. And uh They'll have lots of surgeries in there. And then India is a place it's full of good vibrations, no doubt because we have had great things and Chris was there. But it's like where you have the teeth. Uh, you don't have food to eat. When you have food to eat, you don't have teeth. Like that is the situation. While here you are the saints are born in this country.

And you are misguided. And there we have people. Who are not see. And they have the vibrations. This is the dilemma of such. They think, you know, so many of them think you people are seeking. Because uh. You are upset with that. Too much of uh uh machine oriented that's all the thing it's uh more you're seeking is more like a remedy for ills that you have got. They do not think that you are seeking something so deep.

And that there is The seeking of love. They do want. But I must say but as quick. And once the fire has started. We. And how sometimes. It was, it's so interesting. It's so interesting that you think has to you know, like, uh, in Delhi, we had a programme of opening this book. Uh, releasing this book for the first time, and they said, you know, this is too much for me. How will I manage?

See, I've never done that sort of thing. They said, no, no, for me, you have to just give a lecture. That's all. You think it's a yoga programme that we look after the rest of it. So the, uh, president of India, he was among your by me. And all that and so they wrote to this gave us. Luckily he never turned up. So they said, Mother, we can't get him, so why not you become the president then? I said, if you think I'm all right, I don't mind. And The whole press was there, all the members of parliament, very very critical and all very much.

We had taken them. They were taking uh all for 200 people. I said, you have to stay for 800. So will it fill up? I said, you just stay for 800. And they all these people came. I don't know with what ideas they gave them, but there was no place even on the in the passages to move people are sitting in the passages. I said look at this new face coming up. And I said something to never said. I have used a lot of depth in this life.

Because people don't want to hear anything. Like Christ, what did he say that I'm the light, I'm I'm the chiefs. This is not a waste, is it? You think so? I mean, if you are something now, if I am a Nirmana, I should say I'm. Is it? Like Krishna, I said, some of them are but did your mommy comes out. You are all Dharmas is all these like uh religions. It doesn't mean the religion event, but what he's saying that all sorts of uh sustainers that you are observing just come to the ser so that you go beyond. Was he was But he was very tactful.

He didn't have the masks. He told only to nobody else. But somebody who had an eye and ear to hear that heard it and wrote it down, but I wish I never told it to the masks, no. Christ did that and what did you do to him? He didn't do any harm, did he? Just what this sentence. So I'm extremely tired. are very elusive by nature. So don't be taken up by my words, asked one. I mean you see, that's the only way I can approach.

People have tried all sorts of things like Krishnas, you can say diplomacy. Then Christ sacrifices our mind is the style of you yes. Because I, if I were not, would not come. Past 4, I must appear just like. I do not so much sometimes, but most of the time I do. And I should be thinking just like you. Absolutely, and you will never know. Your hearts of hearts, you know. But the illusion will be all the time maintaining so that you receive it fully, completely and you master it without feeling any abound. You have to be absolutely free, absolutely free.

And I assure you all the protection. Yeah I'm quite surprised the way you can manifest your power. I know Great. And then Which I have said again and again is the heart of the. must understand hot. Has to stand up for the. And has to fight The stand so that you prepare. For the advent of the last. Do what you want? Who's going to come with his 11 hours.

I'm just going to sort it out. There is no. Persuasion, no realisation, no knowledge, nothing to sort it out. Before that? You have to save all your friends, save all the people. And salvage them and you are the workers, you are the people who are going to do it. I'm just in the background. I don't know. I don't. That's all regarding the different deities, have you got one of these things?

And the centres and all those things I've got some literature this one the little ones. So just show them what you have now you can uh get those cycles ty and all that and you can see for yourself what are the centres and uh how they are represented on your feet. When you are realised, you can start feeling. For example, these children had cold, you see, so I started feeling burden on the right hand feet, not that I feel, but you would start. You've been feeling all with the cold the children had, and it's working now. This is the centre of. And when there is school you feel on the right hand is the physical address. On the left hand, it is then the person feels guilty, mostly he may be a cat. Yeah. It's very interesting, you know, to find out about people, and you're amazed when you discover it like going, you know, one day he, he was, uh, worried about his father that he's not.

Why do you want to just see the vibration? This is telecommunication, absolutely. So I said, Mother, I'm getting. He's here. I said, that's your father's. He said, This is our father. This is your mother. I said, all right, so he's got something wrong with. He's bronchus must be bronchitis or something, so he rings up home and the mother says that you see your father has had very bad bronchitis. You saw even Nixon going into.

Problems, see, we could see him long time back before it happens. A person may appear to be very great, a very big sick. Just put your hands last. You don't know sort of a feeling. Your vibrations will immediately stop or you get tingling, sometimes burning, sometimes you have blisters. It's that bad. Yourself, you are the instrument. You are the one who diagnosed it. You are the one who cures it. This is the set for that.

Is there any question? Um, yes, what. I got thousands of customers so I, I got thousands, but. What you're talking about now, um, Peter and, and, and, and tell me this is about you. What is the relationship between the self-realization that you are able to give almost immediately and enlightenment in the sense of being free from the wheel of car? Do you see what I mean? That, that. Enlightenment. Well, in the sense of being free from the wheel of karma, do, do you see what I mean? Oh, immediate, immediate release.

What is karma? See theory you must understand what is the karma karma, who does the karma is your ego. What commas do you? Is your ego that gives you the sense that you are. You don't do anything whatsoever, I think you know. It's the ego within you which doesn't not the ego. Is here like this you see rises from the right goes like that and super he goes like this when the kundalini rises, both are sat down and your attention is above the when you laugh at it Oh, Mr. Napoleon, how do you do sir? The karmas are dissolved because you have no keto. It's like this very simple is say when the sun is on the side, you can see your uh shadow, all right, but when it comes on your head, the shadow disappears in. But one is sort of when you read.

Um, well, in Eastern scriptures, um, because, you know, the Western scriptures going to have any reincarnation too much anymore. Um, one is sort of led to believe that this is something that's how they must do it, you see, all of them are like that thugs. So what they have to they have to make you believe into something, you see, otherwise, how are they going to say why you don't get it? Is that your? Then why are you there? You see what I would say that what are you doing there collecting our money? Simple question. You see, if it is our kar mass by which we are suffering, you are the one who are cleansing. There's one very wonderful one in, yeah, he said I take only 1 upon 100 and something of your karma. I said, why this mathematics.

Why not the whole of it? And then he says, you see, for the rest of it you have to work hard, and what is working hard is service. What is service, big, big trucks, see, and there's a big, uh, what do you call, uh, piggy banks, things like that and the piggy banks is the size. And people from all over the world come there for that service and that cleansing. You see they'll be fooling up. I, I wanna also put it another way around that you said earlier something about. We come to you, as it were for, for some reason. Is it that in the past we have done something to show a merit coming to you? Is it, is it like that because it seems it's almost too easy, you know. Do you see what I mean?

I mean it must be difficult. Well, now you want to very simply. See, your breathing is so easy, isn't it? Did you consult any book or did you find out about karma? Well, because it is so important for you in the same way your evolution is very important. If you are not evolved, the patient will have no meaning. It has to be the simplest of spontaneous. How can it be difficult just think of it. It has to be the easiest. But, um, I'm, I'm not, don't let people off lightly.

I'm sorry. The thing is, I've always felt that if my life is difficult, it's because I've done things wrong in the past which have made it like that. Now it seems unlikely that my life is suddenly going to change. This is like your priest telling you, come and confess something. Now those who have not done anything, what are they going to confess? So they find out something. I must have done something I have to face the priest then ultimately the priest lands up in the lunatic asylum. I'm gonna tell him I confess, I can't face all non nonsense. It's like in India, you see, we had. The priest coming into a village, you see, and he started teaching them about Christianity when he was going, the head of the village, he didn't know how to.

I said, Sir, we are thankful to you for visiting our village. You have really enlightened us because we did not know what was saying. Now we know what to say. It's like that, you see, but this enlightenment, only in modern times you have to pay. It's so simple. Thank Mhm They have done the difficult work. Christ has done it for you. All right. What can you commitment? It is greater than the love of God.

Tell me why. Um, the thing is that if, if things do go a bit wrong for one, if things do tend to go a bit wrong, if one can somehow. Say, well, it must be my fault in the past, then you don't feel bad towards anyone else, whereas if you feel that you're blameless and things still go wrong, you tend to blame other people, at least you see what I mean? You see, it's better to get yourself into a situation where you're in the wrong, where you're blaming other people, you see, we, we are like this. Either we destroy others or destroy ourselves. Must we do that? We need not destroy others and destroy ourselves also. We are neither guilty nor we are putting guilt on others. Can't we be in between? I mean, can't we be sensitive.

just an agent. It's just we are destroying ourselves by feeling guilty. We're destroying ourselves by that, you see. It's a self destruction, you see, actually, you see-oriented society. Came up to a point that when ego became too much, so just to counteract it, we started with a super ego and super ego is that as, oh, you are ego and you are no good and you are so horrid you will be responsible for Vietnam for EDME, for all the that Bokasa, everybody will identify with and you will feel it while you are a beautiful because. Either you will feel proud of it and you go or you'll feel guilty about it. Now what am I? You just think of me. It's a funny situation, but it is not. It's not You are neither guilty of anything, nor you are to wrong because whatever is.

It's not And there is no guilt which God cannot take one. Because they're really sweet people. That's why. But then one comes back to the old question of um. You know, why, why did God create a world which has suffering? I mean this is a sort of classic question, all right, I'm gonna answer this one, the classical one. Uh, why did you have a child? In the same way what happens in the child. It's green, yeah. This feeling to have a child has come to us from God.

As we want to have a child, he wanted to have a child. He wanted to grow much more fully, and then he wanted to grow with all his powers to that child to enjoy and see for himself. This was just a play of God, his will, his, uh, we can say his paternal feeling that he wanted to express that he created you so beautifully and then he created the whole universe. Everything is so beautiful for you to know the beauty of him. So now has come the moment of maturity is is that why it is so easy. Yes, yes, this is the time of, yes, of course, like you see, you, you can have only one or two slots, all right. The beginning of the tree, it's very difficult to protect the tree and all that was done. No, it's all come up. The blossom time has come, and at the blossom time you do not have to bother. You have to be awful.

So You have to become that. How do you know that this is the time because it's happening. How do you know it's the full time because there are fruits, you can see the fruits. You should also see those who have become fruits, how they are fruits, and you become the fruit and see for yourself how you become the fruit or not. You can see thousands of them. Uh, you can come between sometimes to them see in the villages, thousands of them doing the movies. But feeling the cool breeze gradually has to be understood and practised and see for yourself and mentally to be accepted for Western mind, not for an eastern mind because we know cool breeze means that. They are not to be told, but for a Western Maya, you have to see for yourself what it does, how it works, how it is, how, how it, uh, what it is, how it is. So, I would say that you get your realisation very fast because of your past. But you settle back again and start it because of your breath.

In India we cannot get to realisation very fast because I think they must have been the ones who must have been in England not and back the ones who came to us, those who are born in India who are trying to rule and develop our country to a new. Western one, see. So And you have the real idea about it, but the present has been right. Uh, dangerous, that's why probably there. So it settles back, but doesn't matter. It really does not also. I'm just telling you for precaution because what happens among 10 people. The one who is supposed to be the most dominant, he settles down first. Being dominant dominates others, and they also say. See, because the people who are very dominant by natures always have certain views on others.

So the one whose ality goes down is the one who's really dominating. It might be possessed or might be something down there, maybe any sort of person, but that person will dominate others. And the others will take lessons from that. It's human nature, you know, it's very funny how they go to lunatics for training, same people going to lunatics. What do you say to that? I would like to ask certain questions. Do you want me? How do you do certain things? I can't understand, no, I just can't understand to see a man going to the park, coming out, falling down, getting hurt. You go into the same ditch.

How do you do it? So many things, you know, I would like to ask some time to human beings, but by the time I ask you become realised, so I cannot ask you because you're. It works so fast because it works fast. Are you going to deny it? It's all promised. All promised in all the scriptures promised. If I say now, I have a diamond with me here. Especially doing this. Will you, will you say that how can it be that simple? that it isn't it?

India. You know, the techniques that we've been doing, we've been told that it's so difficult to get there that there's so many ways, the trouble is I will tell you the techniques they will tell you are otherwise that's the way they exist. But in fact we were told the techniques were easy, but in fact all we found was problems. That's even more contorted. This is what led us to fool you. It is. Thank God you have come to this point to listen to me at least, otherwise you would have beat me for saying this. It seems the techniques that are telling you has no meaning to nothing. You read ordinary anywhere it is said. Now Shankara himself said no yoga or something by any method you cannot get it only through the mother's grace you are going to get it.

And in his last book he wrote all these vibekuram and this that and all these duties he gave and then in the end he just praised that's somebody gonna learn is nothing but the praise of the mother, of course he was very clever. Every stanza has a month. But he just praised the mother, and people asked him, what's this? Such an intelligent man like this, he's just praising the mother, is that sufficient? That's the thing. But anyone who would think that if you're saying that TM, for instance, is the wrong road, then somebody in TM would be fairly justified or feel fairly justified and say you're also the wrong road. So how does one know? Yes, that's it. You see, now you should judge it by certain things, you see what is the wrong road and what is the right road. I told you the whole lecture was about.

Isn't it? I told you how to find it. Did he give you your own first question? Did you get your own power? means did you have you any powers going through? No idea at all. Then, can you make out what's wrong with him in collective consciousness? I know that I had more power before I did to him as a child. I had I have now. That's it.

That's it. But apart from that, today when you get your realisation, you will know what's wrong with him, what's wrong with him, what's wrong with her. You can cure it, improve it. You can see with your naked eyes the bundalini about which people have dropped pulsating in your presence, yes so you can see it. I can show you now now. With your own eyes. Did you do that? Uh, only thing he did was counting your money. Yeah. But his uh nephew was married polish off more.

OK One has to understand. That this bar. Has to manifest through you. You must have your own powers. Why do you worry? He might be a very powerful person. All right, so what? Who are you? You do not even get the know-how of the whole thing, imagine. You don't know what he's talking about.

What are these mantas? Just go and ask anyone, any one of these services to call us if you want, I can supply. And these mantras are even sized. I'll give you an example of this. You know, there's a very tremendous difference between the Indian and Sanskrit. And a person is not. We have here one scholar who was not so. But he, he knows about me and he knows that naturally, if he knows about me and if he starts to colour, he knows about. What I say is sitting there, and that's what I do. And these people wanted to call him for a wedding.

They want to have. So they told her that uh Matai is going to this age and it's a he said, not an occasion for me to see her in first. He did not even tell you the meaning of all histras. He did not tell you the know-how of it. He did not tell you how to move them, nothing of the kind, and you think he's better than what? You do not know anything about yourself. You do not know anything about anybody else. What have you got out of here all these years? That You are what's dirty, you see, he says he's got you out of this. I feel we have, is it, is it not true that one has to just keep searching and keep searching?

That's booty shopping. So just keep keep looking. You didn't just give up. You see, it is, this is another problem with the Western. It's very much, you see the Charlie Chaplin I see able to fix those uh nuts on the modern times. Did you see that? And he was on and around with nuts like that. And when he was even released from the work, he would be going on. You know forget that now the release has it's something like that. The shop is still on till they finished the last 5 of them till they've exhausted them completely till they receive all the curses of these groups with multiple sclerosis and all they go on and on.

Still, mother is waiting for me whenever you will come out and play, but why waste your time? OK. Have you got too much money? Mentally you cannot understand, sir. You cannot. Don't try to rationalise. Don't try to rationalise with that horrible fellow, you did not rationalise. Why didn't you ask what is he doing? That's why we're all here now. You couldn't ask a question to him. I see the difference.

Why? I respect you for this that you're free, then ask the question. You have to be free to be completely liberated. You accepted him. I don't know how. He didn't even tell you why he was doing like this. You, the intelligent, the intellectuals. No question. Why didn't you say that? How do you say you are the one who's giving us the right?

Did you ask him the question like this, my child? You should have. How much money did you pay him? The difference between that and this is that with that I was learning a technique. What is learning a technique, a technique which I thought was to do with. I wasn't looking for spiritual guidance and I also wasn't looking for any kind of Um, worship, it's all right. You may not look out for anyone or anything. You wanted to have relaxation. You cannot have relaxation at all. You cannot by any other method.

You have to accept yourself. You have to know yourself, otherwise you can never be relaxed. It's a simple thing, as I said, if your petrol is going to finish all the time. You're going to bed. Unless and until you are realised, you cannot be relaxed. That's the time when you are realised. That's the time your ego merges. but it's quite, it's relative relaxation as close to absolute relaxation isn't it. No, but you see, this is not a shop. In seeking, there is not a shop on that you give me 5%, you see, I want meat only half black.

You can't do it like that. You get it in your heart, but you have to ask for it. If you say I was not sick. Who are you? See, a question comes to me. Ask yourself who am I? Why did I say so that I was not safe? Who was I was I was I a person who had lent money to somebody? That I was asking for it. See, the attitude of an intellectual is like that.

We must ask questions to ourselves. Who are they? We are asking. I'm seeking this now on what premises you are seeing. I'll tell you that you go to a shop, all right, it's that. But when you are seeking, on what right are you seeking? What has given you the right to seek? I ask this, only that you have some money, is it? I mean, I began seeking because ever since I got 2 years old, I just knew I wanted are you are different, but I'm talking about her question. You're different.

It's correct. I'm asking her that if you say that I was not seeking this, I was seeking this. Was there a market on? It's just a question of awareness and what you see is yes, it's a question of, but still supposing something is missing now I would say that you do not have a Buckingham Palace, say for example that's missing. Can you ask for it? No, how can you have no right? Just see my point. Did you follow the point? It's a very subtle point. You see the point.

When you are seeking, I'm seeking this much or that on what grounds. Let's see. On what grants are you seeing? What right have you got to see anymore? What is your basis? Let's see that. You see, we go to the bank. All right, I want 500 pounds. If you do not have any account, then they say get out. If you have a, if you have an account, then you can go and ask.

Now do you have any account for CT? What accounts do you have? That's the point. You reach a point where you, I don't know. That's the only answer you can get, so I would say that you have CT not because. You think you are seeking, but seeking is embedded in you. It is in. You did not ask for human life from amoeba, you become a human being without asking. And you have been made. freedom.

We And when you ask for it, because you are a human being, you are given a freedom and you have a right to ask for it. That's the only right you have got to ask why, why you have to ask it. Why do you have a right to ask is this because God is not going to fall at your feet and say that take your realisation. No, you ask for it. It's not fine, but it's this is the point that you follow. He's not going to fall at your feet and say that my child asked for realisation. sure. We'll put you into such a, such wonderful things that we'll get out of it. To get this gift. It's a privilege.

Do you know that? It's a privilege to be self relaxed. You do not adorn God. God adorns. If you accept the reality, you become greater, but reality doesn't become greater. This is all ego ideas, you see, I, I see reality as if you are obliging the reality. The reality, it cannot be obliged. You are going to be obliged. This is only possible for the gurus to take money from you, and you can say that only give me 5 ₹5 worth of because I don't have money you follow. Good to be.

And when you come to this point of understanding that how this ego plays tricks with you even in things, and they have used it, do you know that they have used your ego. They have pampered it by saying that you can pay for it if you know I can purchase the book. They have paid paid on the American ego much more than that of English, and that's why they are still there to bring them out. They said, no ma'am, we paid for it. I said, go, go ahead, Yankees, go ahead. That's what you can say. One of the gurus has become a Yankee now, you know, he dresses up like that and. Only he had 53 cants. He wanted to buy one sheet, which of course the English thought was too much. They were sent out to America.

No, no, he had not candles, but he had rose for us from English people gift to the guru. Now don't play into the tricks of your. Try to understand it's a privilege if you can get some relaxed. They have always denied all the incarnations, all ego-oriented people. That's the sign. When Christ came, they denied it. When Trishna came, they denied it. When Rama came, they denied it. And they kept up their ego saying that some incarnation is going to come later, and then he's going to hang all of them together. That's what he's going to do.

That's the one who's going to come last but not the least. Try to understand, it's a gift to you. Take it with grant. It's the beauty of God which you have. Just talking about it or thinking about it or being mad about it or doing any sort of a funny gesture about it. There's no technique, nothing what is made of technique. And out of his day. All your techniques are training. OK It's I mean my di so I. No, yes, they're from and they're from and uh Katie's sister wants to come as well tomorrow.

Enjoy. Why do you want to. End of your life. Because maybe there's some condition in the mind. Somebody has taught you like Hindus, you see, you get some ideas in their childhood, they'll go on to. So there was a lady she used to pick her hair like that. I said, what are you to do? She said, my grandmother told me that if you pick your hair like that, then you'll go to swim. I said, now when did your mother, grandmother die? Long time back.

I said, now she's dead at least finished this, but till the age of 70, she was doing that all her life. She couldn't get all. The conditionings are so much, you see, and it's all talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Be careful. Be careful. It's not real. It's not real, but what is it? It's like.
