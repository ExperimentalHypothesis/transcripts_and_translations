Today, we have gathered here to worship the ‘Shakti ́ (Divine Power). So far, many saints, sages, and rishis have written and spoken extensively about this Power (Shakti). And what they could not describe about this Power in their prose, they expressed in poetry. On top of that, they came to realize the many meanings of this (Power). But one thing we may not know is that all these Powers are dormant within every human being, and humans can awaken all these powers within themselves. These Powers that are in dormant state are limitless, nor anyone can estimate their extent because, just like 35 crore deities reside within you; apart from that, there are countless powers guiding them. But we can understand this much that what we have attained our self-realization today, definitely some of these Powers must have played a role in that. Without their action, you cannot attain self-realization. While getting our self-realization, we often think it has happened effortlessly (Sahaja). But there are two meanings of ‘Sahaja’. One meaning is that it happens easily, simply, and the other meaning is, just like how a living activity occurs by itself, the same way you got your Self-Realisation. But if you begin to think about this living process, your intellect will become confused. Suppose, you see a tree. When you look at the tree, you think that 'This is a particular tree.' But what Powers have brought this tree to this form, to this height, in this way? Which Power has made it grow in such a way that it remains within its limits and grows in its own shape?

Then the most amazing thing is ‘the human being’, who has been created in a very special way, with a special thought. And the future of that human being can be attained, it can be obtained, but the first step towards it is self-realization. Just like if you want to light a lamp, the first thing is to bring light inside it. Similarly, once the light is awakened within you, you can ignite it again or you can increase it. But the first task is to ignite the light. And for that, self-realization is absolutely essential. However, as soon as self-realization is attained, all Powers may not be awakened immediately. That is why the saints, sages, and rishis have established that you should worship the Goddess. But the person who has not attained self-realization does not have the right to worship the Goddess. Many people have told me that if they ever recite the 'Saptashati' or perform a yagya, they face great difficulties, and they suffer a lot. So, you should ask them, 'Who did you get this done by?' They would say, 'We called seven Brahmins.' But those are not Brahmins. Those who have not realized Brahma are not Brahmins, and by getting such Brahmins to do it, the Goddess became angry, and you faced difficulties. So, you have a great right to worship the Goddess, and you can even worship Her in person. Not everyone has this right. If someone tries, they may face the opposite result. The greatest thing is that the Power, as much as it is nurturing to you, as much as it creates the world for you, as much as it is generous and loving toward you, it is also equally cruel and wrathful. There is no middle ground; it is either extremely generous or extremely angry. There is no in-between. The reason is that those who are extremely wicked, demons who are bent on destroying the world, those who are leading people astray, who in Kali Yuga disguise themselves as saints, some as pundits, some sitting in temples, others in mosques, some pretending to be mullahs, some as popes, some as politicians—those who hide themselves under various false identities—such individuals who have demonic tendencies must be destroyed.

But you should not go toward these destructive Powers. You just desire, and these Powers will work on their own. The consciousness flowing throughout the entire universe is the Power of that great ‘Mahamaya.’ It is through this Power of ‘Mahamaya’ that all actions occur, and this Power thinks of all the things, knows, and brings everything into a perfect manner, which is called organizing everything, and the greatest thing is that She loves you, and Her love is unconditional. There is no demand in this love, only the desire to give; give you your growth, your prosperity, your well-being, but along with that, it is essential to destroy the obstacles in your path—those that will hinder your righteousness or harm you in any way. But you must not exert your own Power to do so. You only need to invoke this Power, the Goddess, and pray to Her, 'Please destroy these inhuman people.' This is the first thing. Now you are free from any oppression. If anyone harms you, speaks ill of you, or troubles you, you must enter a state of complete thoughtlessness. Start to see everything as a witness, as if it is a drama, like, what a mad man he is, bothering me, what has he got to do? Look at his madness, his mental anguish, his suffering, and laugh at how foolish he is. There is no need for you to suffer about it. The only thing you need to do is to enter into your fort, that is thoughtlessness. And as soon as you enter into thoughtlessness, all the Powers that bring joy, peace, and love will merge within you. But as long as you remain entangled in these matters, thinking about how to destroy him, how to finish him, or how to deal with him, as long as you continue to make plans and conspiracies, believe me, the effect will be on you, not on him.

Swami Ramdas said, 'have as little’, meaning that even your small patience is observed by the Divine. But you have so many Powers within you, so many Powers, that you should first awaken them fully, you should awaken them, know them, have a great respect towards yourself. Now, these Powers do get destroyed, even in Sahaja Yogis, they awaken and then get destroyed; they awaken and then get destroyed. What is the reason for this? Why do awakened Powers get destroyed? For example, a person may have the Power today to excel in a great art form. After coming to Sahaja Yoga, many people have become proficient in arts, learned about them, and a kind of great consciousness has arisen in them, which has greatly increased their creativity. People look and say that he is such an artist that it’s beyond understanding. But then he gets entangled in that very art. Then he becomes famous, his name spreads, and he keeps getting entangled in it. When he gets caught up in this, then his Powers get destroyed because his Powers also get entangled in it. As I told earlier also, the life essence of a tree flowing inside it, circulates around in everything, in every leaf, on every branch, in every flower, in every shade and returns back. Similarly, whatever Powers are flowing within you today and the Powers due to which you are functioning today, you should know that they are all the outbreak of this Power only, and there is no need for you to get entangled in them. You are merely an instrument in between, and when you will understand that you are merely an instrument, then these Powers within you will never weaken or be destroyed. In the same way, I have often seen that the attention of Sahaja Yogis get entangled in these things. Once they reach a certain position, or make great progress in something, you know that many students who could not do anything in the class started coming in the first class. Everything started going very well. Then sometimes they start thinking, 'Wow, we have grown so much. As soon as you start thinking like this, your powers will end and you will start falling.

Now we must think what do we need to do? For example, a person’s business suddenly flourishes, or he starts earning a lot of money, or something special comes into his life, what should he do? He should remain vigilant at all times and say, 'Mother, you are doing this, we are not doing anything. It is your Power working out, we are doing nothing.' It is very important to stay alert, because once your Powers diminish, you will yourself say, 'Mother, everything has sunk, everything is over. How did this happen?' Whatever power is at work, let it become effective. For example, there is a tree, how do leaves fall from that tree - have you ever wondered? There is a kind of cork that forms in between the leaves and the tree. After that, the Power no longer flows, and the leaf falls. This is how it happens with humans too.

Today, his Power is connected to a great Power, and he is receiving it from there. But as soon as he starts to think of himself as something, or sits in his ego, or gets entangled in various activities or competitions, this, that, then a crack will appear, and because of that crack, the person will no longer be able to access what he had received. Because he was merely an instrument. But the Power that was flowing within him got cut off. It's like if the Power of this (microphone) gets cut off, perhaps my lecture won't stop, but it could happen. That is why we need to understand one thing very well that the Powers that are awakened within us, and the new aura that is emerging in our personality, which is expressing our true nature, we must not obstruct that Power. We should not think that we have become something great or that we have achieved something big.

On the other hand, it can also happen that when this Power awakens within you, there may be a kind of sadness set in you. A kind of sadness like, 'Oh, the others have reached so far, but I haven’t. They have done this, but I haven’t done that.' And the person keeps getting entangled in these thoughts. There are some who feel distressed over very small things, very small things. For example, everyone got a badge, but I didn’t get a badge. In Ganapatipule we had very strange experiences. People came and said, 'Mother, give us a box of this.' I said, ‘is this a proper way?' Another person said, 'You gave me so much, but didn’t give it to him.' Is this what it’s all about? In that joy and bliss, there is no need to think about such things. They get distressed over the smallest things. Then there are those who think they are going through something big, like a husband has rebelled or a husband’s path isn’t right, and his wife will keep crying, or if someone’s wife isn’t alright, the husband will keep crying. How many times have you been married in past lives? And now in this life, you are married once, so let’s somehow manage it. Because of that you people remain worried day and night that this sorrow has come to me, this has happened to my son, this has happened to my daughter, this happened to him, that happened to him. Is there an end to this? Can anyone get over this? It’s such a trivial thing that it can’t even be grasped. It’s so petty that it can’t even be held onto. People come and tell me such small things, and I can’t help but laugh. But I quietly listen. But I tell you, ‘You are a Sahaja Yogi’.

I have made your heart like the ocean and your brain like the Himalayas, and now you are talking about petty, meaningless things—talking about this and that, all sorts of nonsense, while the talk about Sahaja is very little. It becomes silent there. In Sahaja, we did not pay attention to anything; in Sahaja, so we become silent. I have heard that people are coming less for meditation in Pune now because Mahabharata has started. I have not seen the Mahabharata; the one I saw is enough. What’s the need to see it again? Now we need to create another Mahabharata. If you are so interested in watching the Mahabharata, then you can order the film and watch it, but if you leave the Puja (worship) and your centre to watch the Mahabharata, where will your energy go? It will go into the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata happened thousands of years ago, and it ended with it. So, people also pay a lot of attention to entertainment. What should entertain us? Humans keep getting entangled in these sorts of things. If you indulge too much in anything, it goes against Sahaja. For example, if you are fond of music, then it becomes all about music. Then you stop meditating and get immersed in music. That is entertainment. If you get caught up in poetry, you get lost in that. Going into excess in anything goes against Sahaja. Remember this well. And another thing is that our Powers must be balanced. Only then will we gain the right knowledge, which means integrated knowledge. If you keep focusing on one thing and keep looking at it, you will not get the integrated knowledge. You will only know that one thing. For example, I have seen that many women, despite being well-educated, do not read newspapers and do not know what is happening in the world. If you ask them about anyone, then they will say who is that we do not know. As for men, they only know which food is good, in whose house good food is cooked, and where to go for a good meal. In India, people get caught up a lot in food matters. A lot. And women also manipulate men by feeding them good food. Powers of both (men and women) get entangled in this. Both of them. Day and night, they think about what to eat, today I want to eat this, today I want to eat that, I will eat at this time, I will eat at that time, will do this. On the other hand, women keep doing these things to please men. In this, both men’s and women’s energies get wasted. So, I have devised a way that every Sahaja Yogi should know how to cook. If someone says, 'I want this to eat,' you should make it yourself. Though after that, everyone will probably go hungry. But it’s okay. You should say, 'If you want this, you make it yourself.' That would be the best. When you start cooking, you will understand what that thing is. It’s easy to criticize or comment on something. It’s easy to say something is good or bad. But when you do it yourself, you realize that the criticisms you were making were completely foolish because we have no right (to judge).  People come to me with such trivial matters, and it astonishes me. You have become a sadhu (saint) now.

The biggest power that has come within you is this, you try it, and you will react to what I am saying now. Try it, you will be able to sleep on the ground, you can sleep on the road. You can stay hungry for ten days and not feel hungry. You will eat whatever food is available, and you won’t say anything. You must observe our foreign Sahaja Yogis, in what condition they live, in what troubles they live. Our Indian Sahaja Yogis there told me that the arrangements at Brahmpuri were not good, and people lost their minds. Because you didn’t go so they had a lot of trouble with food and drink. It was not good. They told me that. So, I went and asked them, 'Where did you enjoy the most?' They said, 'The most enjoyable experience was in Brahmapuri.' I didn’t understand, there were so many complaints received. What was special about Brahmapuri? They said, 'The river Krishna flows there. When you sit by the river, it feels like Mother, it is your current only flowing there.' They kept talking about all this. Here, people are more focused on food and drink. So, sometimes when people say that our surrender is less, it’s because we are very entangled. We have very old traditions in us. Many saints and sages have come here, great people, great ideals have been set, and we know what goodness is because of them. But along with that, we have developed a tendency to be hypocrites. We have a great power of hypocrisy. Anyone can say they are Ram, anyone can say they are God, anyone can say they are Sita ji. This hypocrisy is very strong in us. Someone told me, 'Look, that person is God.' I asked, 'How?' They said, 'He says he is God.' I said, 'What’s the harm in saying that? How can anyone say they are God?' I said, 'He says he is God, but there are certain ways. How can one be considered a God if he is unable to bestow fragrance upon a flower? 'Yes, that’s true, but why did he say that? Why did he say that?' I said, because he is not you. He could not understand how people can tell such bold lies. Or they might say about others, but he only wants money, okay, he takes money but he will give us spirituality. So what is the harm? We have to take spirituality, let him take money, what is there in money? Give him the money. What is there in the money? It is a matter of attaining spirituality. If he is giving us spirituality then we give him money. There is nothing special in money. This is the preparation that they have now, that kind of preparation has not yet happened in us because we have very good ideals like the Mahabharata, Ram, this and that. And we are sitting in the mud. If a worm says it has become a lotus, it can never be, and even if it is made into a lotus, its way will still remain the same.

So, we should understand that all the high ideals we have, which surround us completely and because of that we are very high, but until we realize that we must become what we see, and this internal desire should arise, not an external one. It should come from within. Have we attained this? Have we reached our goal? Have we found it? We must acquire it, and in this, we need to maintain honesty with ourselves. Until we are honest, the Power cannot be honest with you. This is a personal relationship between you and your own self. Examine yourself in different ways and see why these Powers within us are not awakening. Why can’t we achieve this? The reason is that we are, in a way, constantly cutting ourselves off. Any kind of hypocrisy has no place in Sahaja Yoga. You should feel things from the heart, attain them from heart and know them with your inner soul. There is no need for any external display. Some may sit and smile, there is no need to keep smiling? Some sit very seriously, there is no need to do any drama. Whatever feeling you have within is coming out, what is there to do drama. What is there to cause trouble? The emotions we feel inside are flowing out because whatever feelings we have are coming out flowing with this Power, and that’s what we are expressing. And those who will understand once that we need to practice Sahaja Yoga with complete honesty, they will gradually progress. The way I see surrender in the people there, I must say that there is something very unique behind that surrender. And the unique thing is that they think that our welfare should only be spiritual. There should be our spiritual well-being. They do not think about anything else. The benefits of Sahaja Yoga are many. You know it can improve your health, bring you financial success, improve your job, make your mind clear, everything will be alright with your children, and all the worldly things you desire can come to you. You will gain recognition, fame, and people who were not known to anyone will start getting noticed, people will start knowing them, everything will happen. But what is it that we truly seek? Ultimately, it is spiritual progress and nothing else. We should get our spiritual ascent. When this spiritual ascent happens within a person, then the person does not even think about all these things. For him, everything is just a matter. Even the act of Goddess Lakshmi washing one's feet is seen as just a matter of insignificance. There is no such thing for him for which he is longing or worried. He becomes capable to this extent. If it is there then it is there, if it is not there then it is not there. If you get it then you get it, if you don't have it then you don't. When this state comes within oneself, when a person comes to this state, then one should think that Sahaja Yogis have achieved something in their life. Unless this condition is achieved, your boat will continue to wobble and you will keep moving here and there. The greatest Power you have within you to establish yourself first is, Adoration."

You should realize this Adoration in your heart and remain in its bliss, enjoy it, and stay in its joy. The Power of this blissful faith should be embraced, and you should remain in that ecstasy. Until human beings completely immerse themselves in this joy, all their problems and questions will remain unresolved. Because problems are all illusions, they are just tricks of Maya. If you ask someone, what problem do you have? I should have gotten a hundred rupees, but I got only fifty rupees. When you get a hundred rupees then what is the problem? I should have got two hundred rupees, but I got only one hundred rupees. It never ends. Then what is another problem? 'My wife is like this.' You can marry again, but she is also the same, the third one comes and she is also the same. So, your problems never end because you are only not ending them. The solution to ending these problems is to enjoy the bliss within your soul through your adoration and remain in that bliss. After all, everything is for our joy, but until we gain the ability to absorb that joy, what will be the use? It’s like a fly sitting on a flower and saying, 'I didn’t find any nectar.' It should become a bee to get nectar. Until you become a bee how will you get the nectar? If you remain a fly, you will keep buzzing here and there. But when you become a bee, you will go to the right place, take the nectar, nicely fill your stomach and enjoy it with satisfaction. This is the biggest lesson in Sahaja Yoga: our attention should be fully immersed in one thing, and that is our spiritual ascent. But that doesn’t mean you should keep giving bandhan to yourself all the time or keep your eyes closed constantly; that’s not necessary. In everyday life, without changing who you are, how you are, in that form only you should seek the nectar of the soul in your heart. Once the flow of this nectar begins, you will realize that Kabir, Nanak, and all the great saints—Tukaram, Namdev, Eknath—are all within you. They didn’t have anyone to guide them, no one to support them, nor was there anyone to protect them. But you have all this. You are nicely sitting in this protection and still sitting under this shade you open your own umbrella and start discussing things about it, then your Powers will diminish. This time, we must focus on how many Powers we have, how many Powers we have recognized, and how they are working. You can do whatever you wish. Whatever you desire will come to you, but your desires themselves will change.

Your ways and methods will change. For example, no one will stop to watch the Mahabharata anymore. What will they think? Oh, what a wonderful time it is for the Mother! The Mother is coming Herself; it is time for Puja (Her worship), people from all over the world will rush to participate. From America, I am going there next, they said, 'Please do a Diwali puja.' People from all over the universe will reach there. But here, even people from Kolkata face difficulty coming, even from Kolkata. And I am sitting right here in person. There are people who can easily come, for their own work they will run ten times but they don’t understand how important this is. They don’t realize its value because their adoration is weak. They say, 'We will come when we retire.' As per their convenience. It should be on Sunday, but there must be a holiday a day before or after. Now what is Sahaja Yoga for such tearful people? How far will these horses go? They are not even a mule. How far such people who think such things will reach in Sahaja Yoga, I don’t understand. Everything must be convenient, it must be on Saturday, Sunday, and on top of that as soon as the program is over, we will run away because we need to go to the office the next day. You will go, everything will be fine, but if you rush, I will stop you at the ghat of Khandala. But all these little games, these mischievous acts, how much ever I do, until this enters your intellect, what is the use? So, I am desiring to somehow bring you on the right path. If you keep slipping off the path, how much effort will I have to take? and all your powers, which can awaken and flourish itself, grow itself, they all will be wasted. So, first you must refine yourself. You must understand the glory of your own Powers and realize how many Powers we have and how many we can attain. We can rise so high. We have so much to offer others. All this treasure is within us, it has all opened, the key is in our hands, and now we just need to take it out and share it with others, and just enjoy it. The worship of Power that is happening today, I want you to understand that it should be the worship of your own Power. The one that will make you become completely sincere and true in your devotion. Saints and sages never had to be told anything. They were beaten, poisoned, no matter what happened, their dedication never wavered. Now you all have been connected, but the connection is so weak that it needs to be established again and again. It gets disconnected because of various things, and you need to reconnect. So, now you have to think that we have to awaken all the powers within us, then there will be no shortage, you will have no question. It is very easy. The only thing required is dedication. The one who has dedication, who completely immerses themselves in Sahaja Yoga, whose attention is always drawn towards Sahaja Yoga, will find their well-being. But first, proper union needs to be established, and half-hearted union is of no use. You will neither be here nor there. That’s what will happen.

A small seed has the Power to create thousands of trees. So, you are a human being, the owner of thousands of such trees. And you also have the power to empower thousands of them. But, after that seed gets sprouted, you throw it on the road and neglect it, the tree will not grow, then its Power will become dormant. Therefore, you must fully understand what you are and what you are doing, and how far you can reach. With this, quarrels among each other, small petty issues, such things which even roadside people don't do, rudeness, all this will collapse by itself. That is not going to survive. But, your true, beautiful form will emerge. And people will say that this is a powerful man standing. A special type of man is standing. Is a great someone. His entire behavior is so unique. He is not afraid of anyone, he is fearless. Where it has to be said, he says, where it is not to be said, he does not say. Now you want that he should get it, father should get it, father’s grandfather should get it, it cannot happen. They do not have the same capability as you. They are unworthy. Leave those unworthy, what is there to fight with them. There is no need to fight with the unworthy. It was your ill fate that you got married to an unworthy, just think that, it was your ill fate that you got an unworthy father and mother. Those who are unworthy, why bring them in Sahaja Yoga forcefully and make them sit on my head that ‘Mother, please make them alright because she is my wife, he is my father, my grandfather.’ I have no relation with them. If they are not in Sahaja yoga then you please keep those worthless outsides. Make friends with worthy people every day and enjoy them. What do you need? But what we do not understand is that this world and these relationships continue like this. There is nothing in that. Yes, if the person with whom you have company can get up with you, can walk with you, can be with you then it is fine. Otherwise, there is no need to bring such worthless people into Sahaja Yoga. And I see very incompetent people sometimes come to Sahaja Yoga through this relationship and I get a big headache.

You had dignity, that is why you came and you attained Sahaja Yoga. You were blessed. You have achieved a lot and you can achieve more. And what is the meaning in giving to a beggar? Now he is a beggar and also has a hole in his bag, what is the use of giving more to him? So, it has multiple defects. There’s no need to maintain relationships with such people. There’s no need to talk to them. Let them speak whatever they want. If their mind gets straightened, they will come and join Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise, why should you waste your mind? It’s of no use. These people have heads like stones; they can't see anything. So, from today, we need to think that we are individuals, and we have attained this because of the actions (karma) from our past lives. Because we performed good deeds, we are sitting in this position today, and we can reach even higher positions. Therefore, don't carry such heavy stones behind you and dive into the ocean. If you know how to swim, then swim freely and enjoy it. Immerse yourself in all your Powers. Today, I offer my infinite blessings for all the dormant Powers within you to awaken, and that as they gradually awaken, you feel them. And enjoy the special streams of flow that flow from within it.

This is my infinite blessing to all of you.

[Second Audio track]

You can understand that we are very different from those who cause trouble, from the oppressors, from those who, in the name of religion, are spreading fanaticism, from those who are looting money in the name of God, and from those who are doing all sorts of wrong things under the guise of goodness. A great revolution has taken place within us, and perhaps we haven't even realized how significant this revolution is and what all we have gained. Suddenly, so much peace and joy have come into us, and in addition, a wonderful power has awakened within us, because of which we too can help others and we too can know Sahaja Yoga.

All these processes are extremely subtle, all the knowledge is very subtle, still you have all grasped it with such ease, attained it, and understood it. The love among you is growing—it does not diminish. Gradually, mutual friendship is increasing, and a profound sense of devotion and joy is emerging in each other's company and love. Some people move ahead quickly, while others lag behind, but we are all together. Even if some go ahead, the rest of the group pulls them if their backs are not turned in that direction. In this way, mutual goodwill has suddenly blossomed within us—suddenly! We did nothing special for it, we did not make any effort for it; we simply realized how much joy, love, and enjoyment there is in harboring goodwill. How much fun life is!

There were many tendencies within us that can be described as completely impure, full of flaws. There are many reasons for this. When we were born in this country of India, its shortcomings also became attached to us from childhood, and we became attached to them as well.

First of all, our parents—we get attached to them; these are our parents. Then, most parents teach their children, “See, love others, have goodwill towards them.” But you can see how limited this goodwill is. Sometimes, even parents do not have goodwill towards each other, and then it is not present among siblings either.

So, in the home environment, where we live together, eat together, endure hardships together, walk together—even there, people separate themselves. This is called discrimination or division. It means making distinctions in everything—“You are different, we are different”—and as this division keeps increasing, it takes hold of us, as if we are locked in a stone fortress. In that stone fortress, more and more similar people start gathering, and it takes on a huge form, just like people form groups over anything (grouping).

This is also a very old hereditary trait we have inherited from animals—that we immediately form our own group. For example, there are people from Delhi, a Noida group is formed; then, people from Delhi who came here form another group, then there’s a North group, an East group, a West group, and then even within that, there’s a group from a particular street. In this way, we keep forming our own groups. This leads to division.

Now, the true nature of this revolution is that the whole world should attain unity, so we should look at these divisive feelings within ourselves and think about why these divisions have arisen in us. By looking within, you can see this. Maybe someone’s parents taught them this. There are many people who say, “Oh, you are a Hindu, you should kill Muslims,” and this gets instilled from childhood. Muslim children are taught, “You should kill Hindus.” Christian children are taught, “Everyone else in the world is useless, only we are God’s chosen ones.” I don’t know how people even think like this. They certify themselves. Jains think that no one is greater than us, and even within their own regions, the same quarrels begin.

When this sense of division grows bigger, people start thinking that folks from other villages aren’t any good. Then, as soon as they step out of their village, it becomes about the province—“Our province is the best, the others aren’t good.” Then it’s about language—“Our language is great, everyone else’s is worthless.” Every time, people keep thinking they’re somehow special, and everyone else is useless. That’s why they feel they have every right to fight with others, be rude, or even hurt them—whatever they want to do.

Especially in our country, the idea of caste wasn’t even considered important in the beginning. You might be surprised, but even today, if you ask someone, they’ll say, “Oh, I belong to such-and-such caste.” But you know, “Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu, Jaati Rupena Samsthita”—if the Goddess lives within someone, then the qualities She brings out in them, those are what matter. For example, if someone is seeking God or the ultimate truth, they were considered a Brahmin. Someone seeking power was called a Kshatriya. If someone was after wealth, they were called a Vaishya. And people who served others or made money through service were known as Shudras. It was all about temperament. That’s what “jaati roopena samsthita” means—your nature, your temperament, that’s what defines your caste.

But later, it all got linked to birth, which really doesn’t make sense. Just look—who wrote the Ramayana? The person who wrote it was a fisherman by birth, and even a former bandit! But his kundalini awakened, and he became a Brahmin—he realized the divine, became “twice-born.” Why did Lord Ram choose him to write the Ramayana? It’s something to think about. He could have called a great scholar from Kashi, but for him, those who just called themselves Brahmins meant nothing. What mattered was someone who had attained the light of the soul.

Even with Krishna—you know, the Gita was written by Vyasa, and Vyasa was the son of a fisherwoman, and no one even knew who his father was! This was all to prove that caste isn’t about birth. Krishna even ate berries from a tribal woman, a bhilni, who had already tasted them to make sure they weren’t sour. Here, we think eating someone else’s leftovers is taboo, but He ate those berries with so much love that Lakshman got upset. But He said, “Are these just berries, or are they nectar?” Sita understood and asked for some too. He said, “No, I won’t give you any, because when will I ever get to offer such nectar again?” There’s so much written about this.

Sita insisted, “But I’m your better half, you have to share with me.” So He gave Her some, and She ate them with great love, saying, “I’ve never tasted anything so sweet.” This old tribal woman, with just a few teeth left, had tested every berry to make sure none were sour, and told Ram, “You don’t eat sour things, so I’ve checked them all.” Because of her love, those simple berries became nectar. Lakshman, seeing both Ram and Sita call them nectar, thought there must be something special about them and asked for some too. Sita teased him, “You were just upset, now you want some?” He pleaded, “Please, sister-in-law, just a little.” When he ate them, he felt his mind change, he calmed down, and wondered what was happening inside him.

When we look at all this, we see that people get caught up in this darkness, thinking, “I belong to this caste,” or “I’m from this country,” or “I’m from this province.” But really, it’s all an illusion. Krishna wasn’t under any such illusion, nor was Ram. Take Vidur, for example—he was the son of a maid, but Krishna went to his house to eat, not to Duryodhan’s. He chose to eat at the home of a maid’s son.

If you look at Krishna’s whole life, you’ll see how he played with the Gopis as if he was just one of them, on their level, sharing the same love. The way he would steal milk, butter, and curd—it was all to show that he was just like them, so people wouldn’t think he was someone special.

So, the main reason for negative feelings is when a person starts thinking, “I’m special.” That’s the root of it. If you think you’re special or better than someone else, it actually means you’re not good at all. Because someone who’s truly good doesn’t need to think, “I’m good,”—they just are. Like, you’re a human being; do you keep thinking, “I’m a human, I’m a human”? No, you don’t, because you just are. You’re not an animal, so you don’t have to remind yourself.

But when someone starts thinking, “I’m better than others, better than people from another caste or country or province,”—as I said, caste itself is an illusion—then people with this attitude gather together, and that’s how things like sectarianism and fanaticism start. It’s all because of this deep darkness, this blindness of thinking, “I’m better than everyone else,” or “There are a few others like me, but that’s it.”

That’s why people can never truly feel goodwill for others, because real goodwill means having a feeling for the truth. Now, you’ve realized the truth—you know that the divine energy is everywhere, your Kundalini has awakened, you have this power, and you understand what the truth is. But having a feeling for the truth is a wonderful thing—it’s a kind of thought, because truth is known through your mind or your central nervous system, or, as we say, through consciousness when it starts flowing. But feeling comes from the heart. So, you know the truth now, you’re aware of it, but that feeling from the heart hasn’t fully come yet.

Until your heart and mind are in sync in Sahaja Yoga, you’re only a half-baked Sahaja Yogi. You can see examples of this—people fighting over small things. If someone is called a leader, I’m just fooling you—any sensible person can see, how can there be a leader in Sahaja Yoga? It’s all nonsense. Anyone who knows the truth knows that I’m just fooling you—how can there be a leader? There’s nothing special about anyone in Sahaja Yoga. Should I say my hand is special, or my nose, or my hair? If even a tiny part of the body gets hurt, the whole body feels pain—so how can anyone be special?

In collective consciousness, you know that if any Sahaja Yogi feels pain, you feel it too. So, you can’t be special. But then people become “leaders,” and sometimes I find it funny—either someone becomes a “leader sir” or like a jailer, and the rest act like prisoners around them! You’re all one; it’s just that I can’t meet everyone individually, so I meet you through someone. Then the leaders fight among themselves—that’s the height of darkness! I fool you on purpose, because if I didn’t, I wouldn’t know who’s really deep in the water.

And then you realize that this kind of negativity is flowing in everyone. One leader forms his own group, another leader has his own group, and so on. Especially in a city like Delhi, where this sort of thing is almost a business—some people belong to Khari Baoli, others to Panchmiyan Road. It’s as if there’s no way for people to mix or move around. When these negative feelings build up between us, we even forget to look for what’s truly special within ourselves.

Then someone starts saying, “Oh, I gave Self-Realisation to five people, and this person didn’t awaken even one.” Honestly, when I hear things like this, it makes me laugh, but sometimes even you all get caught up in this cycle—thinking, “I’m special, I did this, I achieved that.” What this really means is that you haven’t yet entered into non-action (akarma); you still feel like you’re the doer, relying on your ego. And this is a false ego, built on things that aren’t even true.

But what is special about the truth? First, you have to understand the qualities of truth, and then the feeling for it. In truth, you know you’ve gained many powers. It’s also true that so many miracles have happened in your life—you never get tired of sharing them! It feels like they never end: “This miracle happened, that miracle happened, Mother, by your grace this happened, by your grace that happened.” You all keep saying these things. In the light of truth, everything gets sorted out, and you know that God’s hand is over you, guiding you, holding your hand and leading you to the right place, solving every problem that comes your way.

Then, gradually, you start to understand each other better. It’s like sitting in the dark—you don’t know who’s sitting where. If you try to get up and walk, you might stumble over someone. But as soon as the light comes on, you immediately see, “Okay, I’m sitting here, that person is sitting there. If I jump on them, both of us will get hurt.” With truth—pure truth—you start to understand your relationships with others so much more clearly.

And sometimes, people say such lovely things about each other that it brings me so much joy. I really enjoy it when I see one Sahaja Yogi praising another—it makes me truly happy.

Once, there was a program at someone’s house. After the event, I thought to myself, “How will this poor fellow manage to cook food for so many people? How will they do it?” So I said to everyone, “Alright, goodbye, goodbye!” and everyone left. The host just kept looking at me, surprised, and asked, “Mother, why did you send everyone away?” I said, “Well, how were you going to feed so many people? I thought I’d just send them off.” He replied, “But I’d already cooked food for everyone! Why did you send them away?” I said, “Call them back, call them back!” So he ran after everyone, saying, “Hey, there’s food for everyone, please come back!” Everyone was really surprised. Then he said to me, “Mother, didn’t you know he had made food?” I said, “Of course I knew, but isn’t it fun to play along sometimes?”

These little plays of love, these sweet jokes, this subtlety, this tenderness—expressing love in such delicate ways—can only happen when there’s real goodwill in your heart. This can only come from the heart, not from the mind. With your mind, you can know and understand that you’ve achieved something, but the real beauty, the real joy, how to truly enjoy it—you can only know that through feeling. And when you experience that joy, you become so immersed in it that wonderful feelings arise within you, and you don’t even know where they came from or how it happened.

There was once a Sahaja Yogini who went to Sicily. She was sitting alone in a restaurant, eating something by herself, when she suddenly felt some vibrations. She looked up and saw another woman sitting there, eating something else. They looked at each other, and finally, she couldn’t resist and went over to ask, “Are you a Sahaja Yogi?” The other woman replied, “Yes, are you?” She said, “Yes!” They hugged each other so warmly—one was from Greece, the other from Italy—and she told me, “Mother, I felt so much joy that even now, whenever I remember it, I feel like I’m drowning in an ocean of bliss.”

So, loving others, expressing your love, and finding creative ways to show it—this is the work of the heart, not the mind. The mind can know things, but to express them, to show them, to really communicate them—that can only come from the heart. You may know a lot, but if you can’t express it, what’s the use? Even small gestures can show your love.

When everyone starts connecting with each other through these really fine, subtle threads of thought and feeling, it brings so much joy. But if, while sitting there, you start thinking, “Oh, I’m so-and-so, I’m special,” then it’s like you’re standing on the shore of an ocean of joy but just wasting your time, beating your head for no reason. If someone asks, “Why are you upset?”—well, there’s an ocean of joy right here! But the real issue is, “I think I’m special, and that person said something to me, so now I have to give it back to them. Why did they say that to me?”

The special thing about feeling in truth is that it can sweep you away, like a wave in the ocean that crashes on the shore and then, as it returns, creates these subtle ripples. In your life, it’s like a poetic creation is happening, and you get completely absorbed in it because it’s something new, something you’ve never experienced before as a human being. Like I’ve told you, in the ordinary human state, there’s always some sort of conflict, some negativity—even between parents and children, or anyone, because relationships are always relative, never absolute.

But here, why do you love? You love just for the sake of love. Is there any question about it? It’s fun, so you do it. You love because it brings you joy. But this can only happen when your heart understands this system. Until you cross over, there’s still this “shudra” (lowly) state inside, so much conflict and filth. That should all drop away the moment you come into the light—but for some people, it doesn’t, and it really should.

When your heart becomes pure—like just now, when the doctor said, “I welcome Shri Mataji from my heart,” the moment he said “from my heart,” my eyes filled with tears. God has given you such a high thing—the heart, where the soul also resides. Even though the soul’s seat is said to be here (the head), its home is in the heart. So even if you’ve received the light, if it doesn’t bring you joy, it means your heart still hasn’t opened, you still haven’t truly known it.

If you don’t have the right feeling toward someone, you should fix it. Ask yourself, “Why do I feel this way? Why did I get offended?” Maybe you went to someone’s house and they said, “Please, have a seat on this chair,” and maybe the chair wasn’t that great, so you felt bad. But taking offense isn’t the sign of a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja Yogis shouldn’t be offended by anything, because you aren’t bad, so how can you feel bad? How would you even know what’s bad or good? You should know the comfort of your own soul, because the soul lives in the heart, and you should find out what brings comfort to your soul.

I’m saying all this because now, people from Delhi have made so much progress in Sahaja Yoga that we don’t worry anymore. But earlier, people used to get really anxious, almost like “Oh no, here comes Mohammad Ghazni!” When people would come to Ganapatipule, they’d get so worked up—fighting over which room is theirs and which isn’t, even though they were only there for two days!

It’s funny—when people used to go on pilgrimage, they’d sleep on the road, or when they went to the Himalayas in the old days, just imagine what they went through. But now, when they come to Ganapatipule, they want a five-star hotel! Then, if the food isn’t up to their standards, they complain: “The food wasn’t good.” “Oh, in Lucknow, the kebabs are so much better—what is this supposed to be?” Well, why didn’t you bring the Lucknow kebabs yourself then? They argue about the taste, about how things are arranged, about everything. They just don’t get it—every little thing, they have to react, as if they’re some VIPs who have a right to everything: “Why is this here? Why is that color used? Why is it made like this?” They do nothing but sit in their chairs and criticize everything.

And as for comfort—if there’s no bus, just walk! What’s the big deal? If you’re a Sahaja Yogi, you could walk for miles and not even notice. But if you’re still a “big shot,” then you can’t walk—you just sit in someone’s bus and cause problems for everyone else. Honestly, you should learn from the foreigners. They have big houses, cars, and live in so much luxury, but when they come here, I ask them, “Should we get you a luxury bus?” and they say, “Mother, why bother with a luxury bus? We love the regular S.T. buses!” I ask, “Why?” They say, “It’s so much fun! Everyone falls on each other, the bus rattles, sometimes it breaks down, and we all have to push it—that’s where the real fun is! In a luxury bus, there’s nothing to experience—no events, no stories. Where’s the fun in that?”

And then, in places like Brahmapuri, people say the conditions are terrible, but I never feel that way. For them, the best comfort is just being there with everyone, and they forget everything else. Once, some Sahaja Yogis went to Brahmapuri. The Indian “big shots” came back and complained, “The food was terrible.” Must have been made by Maharashtrians, so why would people from UP like it? Why would Punjabis enjoy it? If it’s South Indian food, Punjabis want Punjabi food, UP people don’t want Rajasthani, Rajasthanis don’t want Marathi, Marathis don’t want South Indian—there’s just no standard. They said, “Everything was bad, arrangements were bad, Brahmapuri was just the worst.”

That’s why I don’t take people on tours anymore—who wants the headache? If you all get upset, you’ll throw everyone into the Krishna river! But when I asked them, “Out of all the places you visited, where did you have the most fun?” they said, “Well, leaving aside Ganapatipule, there’s no place better than Brahmapuri—it was amazing!” I said, “Really? But I got letter after letter, phone call after phone call, everyone complaining about Brahmapuri!” They replied, “That’s the fun of Brahmapuri—the only difference is, when you start enjoying the bliss of your soul, it doesn’t matter where you are, you just feel joy. That’s what matters: everyone’s just having fun together, laughing, playing, something is always happening.”

We need to understand this too—we’re not such big shots. But this “big shot” attitude brings so much negativity that sometimes I really wonder how to make things comfortable for everyone. But one thing is certain: no matter how much comfort you give your body, your eyes, your five senses, it never brings real satisfaction or joy. True joy only comes from the comfort of the soul.

This time, at Ganapatipule, we’ve arranged things so that if you want, you can stay in the MTDC in air conditioning, or even bring a couple of air conditioners or fans with you—no problem! Do whatever you like. Like Hazlitt said, you can take the whole metropolis with you on a picnic. Or, you can come with the mindset that you’re on a spiritual journey and see how much comfort your soul can find, no matter what the conditions are. How can we live? What can we handle?

Now, we’ve set up a few things there, and I’m curious to see how many people can stay comfortably—without fighting, without arguing. Because if you want to fight, it’s better you stay in the MTDC! But if you want to live with love, we’ve created some special things—let’s call them huts. And if, in those huts, there’s love among you, and after knowing the truth, you feel, “He has also realized the truth, I have also realized the truth—so what should our feelings be? How can we enjoy this together?” You’ll come to realize that the joy of the soul only comes from the joy of another soul—there’s no other way. If you can understand another’s soul and love them, and I don’t think this is something you can force with your mind—it’s a state you reach. In that state, you experience joy.

For example, we have such a disease of casteism here. There’s a gentleman in Maharashtra who’s a very devoted Sahaja Yogi, but he’s from a scheduled caste. In India, it’s almost impossible to arrange a marriage for his daughter—no one wants to marry her, even though she’s beautiful and wonderful in every way. But, thanks to God’s grace, foreigners don’t have this caste problem. They’re ready to marry her, waiting for her! He is an ambassador’s son waiting, saying, “I don’t know when she’ll come, but I’m waiting,” and his sister and parents are all hoping too. But here, if someone says they’ll marry a scheduled caste girl, it’s a big deal. These things are still so deeply stuck in us. We still think, “I’m from this caste, I’m from that caste.” Honestly, we should be ashamed. Just look at your own caste.

For example, I was born into Christianity, but our family—you know the Shalivahan story—we’re called the Chhanno clan, and honestly, I think that’s just another disease. I’m embarrassed to say I’m from the Chhanno clan, because in my opinion, there are a hundred vices and not a single virtue in this clan! All they do is worry about marrying off their daughters—who will she marry, which family, what arrangements—and the rest of the time, they drink, beat women, and if they have money, indulge in every vice possible. I’ve never heard of anyone from the Chhanno clan doing anything noteworthy—no one’s written a book, no boy has shown any bravery. The clan is so bad that they even said Shivaji Maharaj couldn’t be crowned because he wasn’t from the Chhanno clan. Then Gagabhatt, a renowned scholar, came and performed his coronation anyway. Just think—are you even worth the dust of Shivaji’s feet? And yet, people think so highly of themselves.

And look at how Brahmins have deceived people—how they tormented Dnyaneshwarji, tricked and harassed him so much that he took samadhi at just twenty-three years old.

Such a great soul came into this world and was lost, all because of this caste system and the idea that “this is wrong, that is wrong,” as if you’re the only authority on what’s good. But do you ever look at yourself and ask, “What am I really?” As Sahaja Yogis, we should ask ourselves: Can I sleep on the ground without a pillow? Can I marry someone from a so-called lower caste without caring about it? Can I be comfortable anywhere, in any situation? Can I enjoy myself no matter the circumstances? If someone thinks they’re superior, can I still stand tall with my own dignity? And if someone thinks they’re inferior, can I still respect them? Otherwise, we’ll end up like donkeys—if someone walks in front of us, we make them hold their ears, and if they walk behind, we kick them! What’s the difference then between a donkey and a Sahaja Yogi?

But at least a donkey can sit and sleep anywhere—maybe we should learn that from them! We really need to ask ourselves: Why do we hurt each other’s feelings over these petty, lowly things? Especially among women, I think, there’s a lot of emotion, and we should reflect on what good thoughts we’ve had about others. You know how it is with women—if she’s good, she’s an angel; if not, she’s a ‘bhoot’! There’s no in-between.

Then there are those who come to me and say, “Mother, please find me a wife who is very full of vibrations.” So I arranged a marriage for one such gentleman with a girl who really was full of vibrations. She may not have been beautiful by worldly standards, though I found her lovely, but she has so much vibrations that I always felt love for her. And this gentleman—he’s British, tall, handsome—he came and fell at my feet, saying, “Mother, you’ve given me such a wonderful wife, such a beautiful wife!” Others were questioning my choice, but I said, “Just wait and see!” He can’t even stay in London anymore—he keeps running back here, saying, “When I’m with her, I feel such peace. Mother, you’ve given me such a loving wife.” Because once you understand the importance of vibrations and the soul’s connection, you just can’t get caught up in these petty, low-level things anymore; they just don’t appeal to you.

So, we really need to change. I’ve talked about physical comfort—sure, it’s fine to care about it, but if you get stuck there, you can’t make real progress, and you won’t solve any real problems. People say you’re a model for India, an example for everyone. But I think you’re a model for each other—you’re like leaders, standing as an example of how everyone should be. And you should say it openly: “Caste and all this stuff is nonsense, we don’t believe in it at all. We don’t belong to any religion—we belong to the pure religion, Nirmal Dharma. We don’t follow any of this, and we say it openly!”

Even now, Sahaja Yogis want that if a girl is Punjabi, she should marry a Punjabi, so she can scold her mother-in-law in Punjabi whenever she wants! If someone from another language comes in—say, a Marathi girl—she won’t understand what’s being said, and she’ll be lost: “What are they saying? I don’t get it.” That would be a real problem for them; their plans would be ruined. So they want someone from their own community, and then they’ll say, “You didn’t send this on Bhai Dooj, or that on Diwali, you didn’t do this or that.” But if you marry someone from another community, she’ll say, “We don’t even have that custom, how am I supposed to do it?”

It’s very difficult for Indians to marry outside their community. As soon as someone does, everyone gets stiff and awkward, as if they’ve seen a snake! I have a friend, a well-educated doctor, who used to be very cheerful. I met her in Bombay recently, and she looked completely shocked. I asked, “What happened?” She’s Maharashtrian. She said, “Oh, you have no idea, I’m in big trouble.” I asked why. “My daughter married a Punjabi.” “Which Punjabi?” She told me the name—I know the family. Both sets of parents are in shock! How long can a couple stay happy if these feelings exist between the families?

Then there are all the physical complaints: “My daughter-in-law didn’t ask me for tea in the morning, she didn’t do this or that, and when we went to Ganapatipule, no one was waiting with a garland for us, they did aarti for Mataji but not for us, Mataji got the best room and we didn’t.” I say, “Fine, you take the room, I’ll stay outside!” These physical complaints lead to bigger fights, and then there are mental complaints: “I just can’t get along with this man, Mataji.” I ask, “Why not? What did he ever do to you?” “He just doesn’t have manners.” Is manners really such a big deal? If someone doesn’t have them, maybe they’re from a village, or maybe they’re not from your region.

In Lucknow, people are very polite, but don’t be fooled—they won’t actually do anything for you! They’ll invite you over, but when you get there, they’ve disappeared, or at most you’ll get one roti and hear, “Don’t be so formal!” So after a while, we’d eat at home first before visiting. So, from that perspective, everyone is rude! Go to a Punjabi house, and they’ll give you a huge glass of milk. I can’t drink that much milk! But you have to, or else...then they will go around and spread the word, “That Mataji is so stubborn, she came to our house and didn’t even drink the milk!”

All these little things—really, we should laugh at them and realize how silly they are. Some people have manners, some don’t, some have love—I enjoy everyone, no matter what they’re like, because everyone is unique. That’s where the fun is! If everyone were the same, life would be so boring. Wherever you go, you’d hear the same thing. I love going to Haryana—the people there are so straightforward, it feels like they’re about to break your head with a stick! [Shri Mataji laughs]

Go to a Maharashtrian’s house, and they’re a different type—quite stingy, actually. They don’t have much money, so they’ll take one guava and share it among eight people and claim —“We had fruit!” [Everyone laughs] “Remember that day we had fruit? We’ll never forget it!” Go to a South Indian’s house, and it’s idli in the morning, idli in the evening, idli all the time. They’ll say, “Our food is so cheap, just two rupees fifty paise for a meal!” But how much can you eat? And the chilies! If you don’t eat spicy food, you’re in trouble. I can’t handle much spice. So you keep laughing, but the fun is in enjoying everyone’s uniqueness.

You must have seen some people even do impressions of others, and it’s hilarious—you see how everyone expresses their uniqueness in their own way. Every person has their own special flavor.

I travel a lot, and once, early on, I went to Bengal. Someone told me, “There’s this special gold bangle there, very pure—be sure to get one!” I asked, “Alright, where can I find it?” They said, “There’s a shop called Lakhi Babu’s Gold & Silver Shop.” So I asked my well-known brother-in-law to take me there. He laughed and said, “Alright, get in the car, I’ll take you.”

So we went, and there were shops everywhere: “Lakhi Babu’s Gold & Silver Shop,” then “The Real Lakhi Babu’s Gold & Silver Shop,” then “The Real Real Lakhi Babu’s Real Gold & Silver Shop!” [Everyone laughs] Sometimes the real one was here, sometimes there—I said, “Oh God, how will I ever find this bangle?” I joked, “They should just name the whole street ‘The Real Real Lakhi Babu’s Real Gold & Silver Shop’s Real Lane!’” [Everyone laughs]

You see, there’s fun everywhere, but you have to know how to enjoy it and understand how different societies work, how people live, how much variety there is. Sometimes it’s a rose, sometimes a jasmine, sometimes another flower—if you know how to enjoy the fragrance of every flower, then you’re a true Sahaja Yogi. Then so much goodwill arises, and people even start talking like each other. Punjabis, for example, always say, “Sawaal paida hi nahi hota!” (The question doesn’t even arise!)—but ask an Englishman what that means, and he’ll say, “‘The question does not take birth’?” [Laughter] It’s just a way of speaking, but what can you do? That’s how Punjabis talk!

Every city, every place, has its own charm. When you start enjoying it, you see beauty everywhere. Once, I was in France and there was heavy fog. All the leaves had fallen, and the branches were spread out against the sky—it looked like a painting. The fog would come and go, creating a real drama. The others with me were saying, “What a dirty place! It’s awful here.” I said, “No, look at it! Where else will you see something like this? See how beautiful this play of nature is!” But they just couldn’t appreciate it.

So you have to realize that every person has their own fragrance—you just need the ability to sense it. There’s joy in everyone, something to learn from everyone, and something you can give to everyone. Everything God has created is for us to share love, to understand each other. All of creation is so beautiful so that goodwill can awaken within us. When you visit a beautiful place, you should feel how lovingly God has made it, and let yourself be filled with that love. Love doesn’t mean loving yourself—it means loving others. Until you naturally feel this mix of feelings for others, you’re not truly a Sahaja Yogi.

For example, men who are Sahaja Yogis might know all about the chakras, the deities inside, how the Kundalini rises, where it comes out of the head—they know all the technical details, but they don’t know what love is, or what feeling is. They’ll fight with each other. Sometimes I say, “Fine, I’ll bring a stick, break a few heads, then you can come inside!”

Women, on the other hand, know exactly what to feed and serve everyone, but if you ask them about the chakras or if their Kundalini is catching on something, they won’t know. When both sides—knowledge and love—come together, then you’re really in poetry, not just circling the periphery. If you only have love or only knowledge, you’ll end up clashing, and that’s when all sorts of awkward feelings and people start appearing.

For example, if you love someone and they don’t respond, you get upset. Like a woman once said, “I want a divorce because my husband comes home late.” I said, “But at least he comes home. If you divorce, you will not see him at all, why divorce him for that?” It’s the same with truth—if someone shows you love and you insist on telling them the truth, they might get offended: “They don’t know the truth, they’re so foolish, they just don’t get it.”

The integration of both (love and knowledge) can’t happen at the periphery—it has to happen at the center. And to come to the center, your Kundalini must be fully awakened, you must meditate deeply, and you must always stay alert, asking yourself, “Am I in the center?” When your left and right sides are balanced, you come to the center. And it’s only in the center that you experience the present moment—and only in the present can you enjoy true joy, not in the past or the future.

So, when you come into the present, it’s like a wheel: everyone else is spinning around the rim, but the center point—the axis—must remain still. Without that stillness, no motor, no vehicle can run. In the same way, when you come into your own center, you can rise higher—there’s no other way.

You can’t even talk about this with people who are not Realised, because they’re still stuck in struggle, always fighting among themselves. But those who are Realised know what it means to be in the center. Sure, sometimes you sway to one side or the other, but when you’re truly in the center, it’s like an antithesis forms: something comes from one side, something from the other, and then something entirely new emerges, and you rise above it all. When you rise, your outlook on everyone becomes peaceful and detached. You become truly impartial, because you have no expectations. If you love, you love for the sake of love. If you speak the truth, you do it for the sake of truth. If someone accepts it or not, fights or abuses you, it doesn’t matter. If you love and they don’t accept it, that’s fine too. Because you know the truth, and if they don’t, it’s okay—they just haven’t understood your love yet. So you remain content and joyful within yourself.

But when others join you in this state, it becomes collective joy—not just collective consciousness, but collective joy. And today, we really need collective joy, not just collective awareness. You’re all coming to Ganapatipule, and I don’t want you to face any difficulties there. But remember, we’re going for our spiritual growth—nothing else. If you come with this mindset, it will help you and everyone else, and many of the things that bind you will suddenly fall away. You’ll discover that detachment, that state where you simply witness everything.

I’ve often told you how much I love the word “Niranjanapane” from Dnyaneshwarji—it means just witnessing, with no reaction. When you witness like this, joy flows through you like the Ganges, from top to bottom. You don’t have to work hard for this; you just need to know that what you’ve received is enough, and you must rise in it. When you rise, it’s as if you’ve come to the middle of a river, and from there, waves will spread to both shores—whether people are rich or poor, religious or not, believers or non-believers. From the center, these waves will break on both shores, where so many problems exist, and those problems will dissolve. Everything can be set right because the divine energy is flowing through you, and it will do whatever you wish.

For example, I came here and someone said, “Tomorrow is Bharat Bandh (a national strike)!” I just smiled—how can there be a bandh when I’m sitting here? There was a big fuss, but it was all over quickly. When you’re in the center, the waves reach both shores, and whatever happens, happens because of such realized souls. Even if you see war coming, it’s because sometimes only war can bring people to their senses about fanaticism. Only then do we understand what’s wrong. When you witness these things, you realize their purpose. Let whatever happens, happen—it’s necessary. Our only wish is that all problems get solved through this.

This state of witness—being established in your own center—is what you need. From there, you can see everything, and you should always look at yourself: “Where am I lacking?” For example, as I’m giving you this lecture today, people are probably thinking, “Oh, Mataji is talking about that person, or my wife, or my husband.” But you should be thinking, “She’s talking about me, about my own faults.” When you look at yourself, you can ask, “What ‘bhoot’ is sitting inside me? Let’s get rid of it!” You can understand this through meditation—by looking within, there’s nothing to fear, because you become detached from body, mind, intellect, ego, and everything else, and are established in the soul. There’s nothing to be afraid of in witnessing yourself.

Today, there was no plan for a puja, but you’ve made so many arrangements, and there’s not much time. If you want, you can do a puja—I don’t understand why everyone is so obsessed with puja! Maybe it does benefit you, I don’t know, but if it does, you should remain established in that state and not fall from it—just keep rising higher and higher.

So, what I’ve said today, reflect on it: Am I really like this? Can I truly unite my feelings and my intellect? Think about it. When you achieve that integration, the whole world will be amazed just by seeing you.
