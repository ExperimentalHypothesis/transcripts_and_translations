Today, we have gathered here to worship the ‘Shakti ́ (Divine Power). So far, many saints, sages, and rishis have written and spoken extensively about this Power (Shakti). And what they could not describe about this Power in their prose, they expressed in poetry. On top of that, they came to realize the many meanings of this (Power). But one thing we may not know is that all these Powers are dormant within every human being, and humans can awaken all these powers within themselves. These Powers that are in dormant state are limitless, nor anyone can estimate their extent because, just like 35 crore deities reside within you; apart from that, there are countless powers guiding them. But we can understand this much that what we have attained our self-realization today, definitely some of these Powers must have played a role in that. Without their action, you cannot attain self-realization. While getting our self-realization, we often think it has happened effortlessly (Sahaja). But there are two meanings of ‘Sahaja’. One meaning is that it happens easily, simply, and the other meaning is, just like how a living activity occurs by itself, the same way you got your Self-Realisation. But if you begin to think about this living process, your intellect will become confused. Suppose, you see a tree. When you look at the tree, you think that 'This is a particular tree.' But what Powers have brought this tree to this form, to this height, in this way? Which Power has made it grow in such a way that it remains within its limits and grows in its own shape?

Then the most amazing thing is ‘the human being’, who has been created in a very special way, with a special thought. And the future of that human being can be attained, it can be obtained, but the first step towards it is self-realization. Just like if you want to light a lamp, the first thing is to bring light inside it. Similarly, once the light is awakened within you, you can ignite it again or you can increase it. But the first task is to ignite the light. And for that, self-realization is absolutely essential. However, as soon as self-realization is attained, all Powers may not be awakened immediately. That is why the saints, sages, and rishis have established that you should worship the Goddess. But the person who has not attained self-realization does not have the right to worship the Goddess. Many people have told me that if they ever recite the 'Saptashati' or perform a yagya, they face great difficulties, and they suffer a lot. So, you should ask them, 'Who did you get this done by?' They would say, 'We called seven Brahmins.' But those are not Brahmins. Those who have not realized Brahma are not Brahmins, and by getting such Brahmins to do it, the Goddess became angry, and you faced difficulties. So, you have a great right to worship the Goddess, and you can even worship Her in person. Not everyone has this right. If someone tries, they may face the opposite result. The greatest thing is that the Power, as much as it is nurturing to you, as much as it creates the world for you, as much as it is generous and loving toward you, it is also equally cruel and wrathful. There is no middle ground; it is either extremely generous or extremely angry. There is no in-between. The reason is that those who are extremely wicked, demons who are bent on destroying the world, those who are leading people astray, who in Kali Yuga disguise themselves as saints, some as pundits, some sitting in temples, others in mosques, some pretending to be mullahs, some as popes, some as politicians—those who hide themselves under various false identities—such individuals who have demonic tendencies must be destroyed.

But you should not go toward these destructive Powers. You just desire, and these Powers will work on their own. The consciousness flowing throughout the entire universe is the Power of that great ‘Mahamaya.’ It is through this Power of ‘Mahamaya’ that all actions occur, and this Power thinks of all the things, knows, and brings everything into a perfect manner, which is called organizing everything, and the greatest thing is that She loves you, and Her love is unconditional. There is no demand in this love, only the desire to give; give you your growth, your prosperity, your well-being, but along with that, it is essential to destroy the obstacles in your path—those that will hinder your righteousness or harm you in any way. But you must not exert your own Power to do so. You only need to invoke this Power, the Goddess, and pray to Her, 'Please destroy these inhuman people.' This is the first thing. Now you are free from any oppression. If anyone harms you, speaks ill of you, or troubles you, you must enter a state of complete thoughtlessness. Start to see everything as a witness, as if it is a drama, like, what a mad man he is, bothering me, what has he got to do? Look at his madness, his mental anguish, his suffering, and laugh at how foolish he is. There is no need for you to suffer about it. The only thing you need to do is to enter into your fort, that is thoughtlessness. And as soon as you enter into thoughtlessness, all the Powers that bring joy, peace, and love will merge within you. But as long as you remain entangled in these matters, thinking about how to destroy him, how to finish him, or how to deal with him, as long as you continue to make plans and conspiracies, believe me, the effect will be on you, not on him.

Swami Ramdas said, 'have as little’, meaning that even your small patience is observed by the Divine. But you have so many Powers within you, so many Powers, that you should first awaken them fully, you should awaken them, know them, have a great respect towards yourself. Now, these Powers do get destroyed, even in Sahaja Yogis, they awaken and then get destroyed; they awaken and then get destroyed. What is the reason for this? Why do awakened Powers get destroyed? For example, a person may have the Power today to excel in a great art form. After coming to Sahaja Yoga, many people have become proficient in arts, learned about them, and a kind of great consciousness has arisen in them, which has greatly increased their creativity. People look and say that he is such an artist that it’s beyond understanding. But then he gets entangled in that very art. Then he becomes famous, his name spreads, and he keeps getting entangled in it. When he gets caught up in this, then his Powers get destroyed because his Powers also get entangled in it. As I told earlier also, the life essence of a tree flowing inside it, circulates around in everything, in every leaf, on every branch, in every flower, in every shade and returns back. Similarly, whatever Powers are flowing within you today and the Powers due to which you are functioning today, you should know that they are all the outbreak of this Power only, and there is no need for you to get entangled in them. You are merely an instrument in between, and when you will understand that you are merely an instrument, then these Powers within you will never weaken or be destroyed. In the same way, I have often seen that the attention of Sahaja Yogis get entangled in these things. Once they reach a certain position, or make great progress in something, you know that many students who could not do anything in the class started coming in the first class. Everything started going very well. Then sometimes they start thinking, 'Wow, we have grown so much. As soon as you start thinking like this, your powers will end and you will start falling.

Now we must think what do we need to do? For example, a person’s business suddenly flourishes, or he starts earning a lot of money, or something special comes into his life, what should he do? He should remain vigilant at all times and say, 'Mother, you are doing this, we are not doing anything. It is your Power working out, we are doing nothing.' It is very important to stay alert, because once your Powers diminish, you will yourself say, 'Mother, everything has sunk, everything is over. How did this happen?' Whatever power is at work, let it become effective. For example, there is a tree, how do leaves fall from that tree - have you ever wondered? There is a kind of cork that forms in between the leaves and the tree. After that, the Power no longer flows, and the leaf falls. This is how it happens with humans too.

Today, his Power is connected to a great Power, and he is receiving it from there. But as soon as he starts to think of himself as something, or sits in his ego, or gets entangled in various activities or competitions, this, that, then a crack will appear, and because of that crack, the person will no longer be able to access what he had received. Because he was merely an instrument. But the Power that was flowing within him got cut off. It's like if the Power of this (microphone) gets cut off, perhaps my lecture won't stop, but it could happen. That is why we need to understand one thing very well that the Powers that are awakened within us, and the new aura that is emerging in our personality, which is expressing our true nature, we must not obstruct that Power. We should not think that we have become something great or that we have achieved something big.

On the other hand, it can also happen that when this Power awakens within you, there may be a kind of sadness set in you. A kind of sadness like, 'Oh, the others have reached so far, but I haven’t. They have done this, but I haven’t done that.' And the person keeps getting entangled in these thoughts. There are some who feel distressed over very small things, very small things. For example, everyone got a badge, but I didn’t get a badge. In Ganapatipule we had very strange experiences. People came and said, 'Mother, give us a box of this.' I said, ‘is this a proper way?' Another person said, 'You gave me so much, but didn’t give it to him.' Is this what it’s all about? In that joy and bliss, there is no need to think about such things. They get distressed over the smallest things. Then there are those who think they are going through something big, like a husband has rebelled or a husband’s path isn’t right, and his wife will keep crying, or if someone’s wife isn’t alright, the husband will keep crying. How many times have you been married in past lives? And now in this life, you are married once, so let’s somehow manage it. Because of that you people remain worried day and night that this sorrow has come to me, this has happened to my son, this has happened to my daughter, this happened to him, that happened to him. Is there an end to this? Can anyone get over this? It’s such a trivial thing that it can’t even be grasped. It’s so petty that it can’t even be held onto. People come and tell me such small things, and I can’t help but laugh. But I quietly listen. But I tell you, ‘You are a Sahaja Yogi’.

I have made your heart like the ocean and your brain like the Himalayas, and now you are talking about petty, meaningless things—talking about this and that, all sorts of nonsense, while the talk about Sahaja is very little. It becomes silent there. In Sahaja, we did not pay attention to anything; in Sahaja, so we become silent. I have heard that people are coming less for meditation in Pune now because Mahabharata has started. I have not seen the Mahabharata; the one I saw is enough. What’s the need to see it again? Now we need to create another Mahabharata. If you are so interested in watching the Mahabharata, then you can order the film and watch it, but if you leave the Puja (worship) and your centre to watch the Mahabharata, where will your energy go? It will go into the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata happened thousands of years ago, and it ended with it. So, people also pay a lot of attention to entertainment. What should entertain us? Humans keep getting entangled in these sorts of things. If you indulge too much in anything, it goes against Sahaja. For example, if you are fond of music, then it becomes all about music. Then you stop meditating and get immersed in music. That is entertainment. If you get caught up in poetry, you get lost in that. Going into excess in anything goes against Sahaja. Remember this well. And another thing is that our Powers must be balanced. Only then will we gain the right knowledge, which means integrated knowledge. If you keep focusing on one thing and keep looking at it, you will not get the integrated knowledge. You will only know that one thing. For example, I have seen that many women, despite being well-educated, do not read newspapers and do not know what is happening in the world. If you ask them about anyone, then they will say who is that we do not know. As for men, they only know which food is good, in whose house good food is cooked, and where to go for a good meal. In India, people get caught up a lot in food matters. A lot. And women also manipulate men by feeding them good food. Powers of both (men and women) get entangled in this. Both of them. Day and night, they think about what to eat, today I want to eat this, today I want to eat that, I will eat at this time, I will eat at that time, will do this. On the other hand, women keep doing these things to please men. In this, both men’s and women’s energies get wasted. So, I have devised a way that every Sahaja Yogi should know how to cook. If someone says, 'I want this to eat,' you should make it yourself. Though after that, everyone will probably go hungry. But it’s okay. You should say, 'If you want this, you make it yourself.' That would be the best. When you start cooking, you will understand what that thing is. It’s easy to criticize or comment on something. It’s easy to say something is good or bad. But when you do it yourself, you realize that the criticisms you were making were completely foolish because we have no right (to judge).  People come to me with such trivial matters, and it astonishes me. You have become a sadhu (saint) now.

The biggest power that has come within you is this, you try it, and you will react to what I am saying now. Try it, you will be able to sleep on the ground, you can sleep on the road. You can stay hungry for ten days and not feel hungry. You will eat whatever food is available, and you won’t say anything. You must observe our foreign Sahaja Yogis, in what condition they live, in what troubles they live. Our Indian Sahaja Yogis there told me that the arrangements at Brahmpuri were not good, and people lost their minds. Because you didn’t go so they had a lot of trouble with food and drink. It was not good. They told me that. So, I went and asked them, 'Where did you enjoy the most?' They said, 'The most enjoyable experience was in Brahmapuri.' I didn’t understand, there were so many complaints received. What was special about Brahmapuri? They said, 'The river Krishna flows there. When you sit by the river, it feels like Mother, it is your current only flowing there.' They kept talking about all this. Here, people are more focused on food and drink. So, sometimes when people say that our surrender is less, it’s because we are very entangled. We have very old traditions in us. Many saints and sages have come here, great people, great ideals have been set, and we know what goodness is because of them. But along with that, we have developed a tendency to be hypocrites. We have a great power of hypocrisy. Anyone can say they are Ram, anyone can say they are God, anyone can say they are Sita ji. This hypocrisy is very strong in us. Someone told me, 'Look, that person is God.' I asked, 'How?' They said, 'He says he is God.' I said, 'What’s the harm in saying that? How can anyone say they are God?' I said, 'He says he is God, but there are certain ways. How can one be considered a God if he is unable to bestow fragrance upon a flower? 'Yes, that’s true, but why did he say that? Why did he say that?' I said, because he is not you. He could not understand how people can tell such bold lies. Or they might say about others, but he only wants money, okay, he takes money but he will give us spirituality. So what is the harm? We have to take spirituality, let him take money, what is there in money? Give him the money. What is there in the money? It is a matter of attaining spirituality. If he is giving us spirituality then we give him money. There is nothing special in money. This is the preparation that they have now, that kind of preparation has not yet happened in us because we have very good ideals like the Mahabharata, Ram, this and that. And we are sitting in the mud. If a worm says it has become a lotus, it can never be, and even if it is made into a lotus, its way will still remain the same.

So, we should understand that all the high ideals we have, which surround us completely and because of that we are very high, but until we realize that we must become what we see, and this internal desire should arise, not an external one. It should come from within. Have we attained this? Have we reached our goal? Have we found it? We must acquire it, and in this, we need to maintain honesty with ourselves. Until we are honest, the Power cannot be honest with you. This is a personal relationship between you and your own self. Examine yourself in different ways and see why these Powers within us are not awakening. Why can’t we achieve this? The reason is that we are, in a way, constantly cutting ourselves off. Any kind of hypocrisy has no place in Sahaja Yoga. You should feel things from the heart, attain them from heart and know them with your inner soul. There is no need for any external display. Some may sit and smile, there is no need to keep smiling? Some sit very seriously, there is no need to do any drama. Whatever feeling you have within is coming out, what is there to do drama. What is there to cause trouble? The emotions we feel inside are flowing out because whatever feelings we have are coming out flowing with this Power, and that’s what we are expressing. And those who will understand once that we need to practice Sahaja Yoga with complete honesty, they will gradually progress. The way I see surrender in the people there, I must say that there is something very unique behind that surrender. And the unique thing is that they think that our welfare should only be spiritual. There should be our spiritual well-being. They do not think about anything else. The benefits of Sahaja Yoga are many. You know it can improve your health, bring you financial success, improve your job, make your mind clear, everything will be alright with your children, and all the worldly things you desire can come to you. You will gain recognition, fame, and people who were not known to anyone will start getting noticed, people will start knowing them, everything will happen. But what is it that we truly seek? Ultimately, it is spiritual progress and nothing else. We should get our spiritual ascent. When this spiritual ascent happens within a person, then the person does not even think about all these things. For him, everything is just a matter. Even the act of Goddess Lakshmi washing one's feet is seen as just a matter of insignificance. There is no such thing for him for which he is longing or worried. He becomes capable to this extent. If it is there then it is there, if it is not there then it is not there. If you get it then you get it, if you don't have it then you don't. When this state comes within oneself, when a person comes to this state, then one should think that Sahaja Yogis have achieved something in their life. Unless this condition is achieved, your boat will continue to wobble and you will keep moving here and there. The greatest Power you have within you to establish yourself first is, Adoration."

You should realize this Adoration in your heart and remain in its bliss, enjoy it, and stay in its joy. The Power of this blissful faith should be embraced, and you should remain in that ecstasy. Until human beings completely immerse themselves in this joy, all their problems and questions will remain unresolved. Because problems are all illusions, they are just tricks of Maya. If you ask someone, what problem do you have? I should have gotten a hundred rupees, but I got only fifty rupees. When you get a hundred rupees then what is the problem? I should have got two hundred rupees, but I got only one hundred rupees. It never ends. Then what is another problem? 'My wife is like this.' You can marry again, but she is also the same, the third one comes and she is also the same. So, your problems never end because you are only not ending them. The solution to ending these problems is to enjoy the bliss within your soul through your adoration and remain in that bliss. After all, everything is for our joy, but until we gain the ability to absorb that joy, what will be the use? It’s like a fly sitting on a flower and saying, 'I didn’t find any nectar.' It should become a bee to get nectar. Until you become a bee how will you get the nectar? If you remain a fly, you will keep buzzing here and there. But when you become a bee, you will go to the right place, take the nectar, nicely fill your stomach and enjoy it with satisfaction. This is the biggest lesson in Sahaja Yoga: our attention should be fully immersed in one thing, and that is our spiritual ascent. But that doesn’t mean you should keep giving bandhan to yourself all the time or keep your eyes closed constantly; that’s not necessary. In everyday life, without changing who you are, how you are, in that form only you should seek the nectar of the soul in your heart. Once the flow of this nectar begins, you will realize that Kabir, Nanak, and all the great saints—Tukaram, Namdev, Eknath—are all within you. They didn’t have anyone to guide them, no one to support them, nor was there anyone to protect them. But you have all this. You are nicely sitting in this protection and still sitting under this shade you open your own umbrella and start discussing things about it, then your Powers will diminish. This time, we must focus on how many Powers we have, how many Powers we have recognized, and how they are working. You can do whatever you wish. Whatever you desire will come to you, but your desires themselves will change.

Your ways and methods will change. For example, no one will stop to watch the Mahabharata anymore. What will they think? Oh, what a wonderful time it is for the Mother! The Mother is coming Herself; it is time for Puja (Her worship), people from all over the world will rush to participate. From America, I am going there next, they said, 'Please do a Diwali puja.' People from all over the universe will reach there. But here, even people from Kolkata face difficulty coming, even from Kolkata. And I am sitting right here in person. There are people who can easily come, for their own work they will run ten times but they don’t understand how important this is. They don’t realize its value because their adoration is weak. They say, 'We will come when we retire.' As per their convenience. It should be on Sunday, but there must be a holiday a day before or after. Now what is Sahaja Yoga for such tearful people? How far will these horses go? They are not even a mule. How far such people who think such things will reach in Sahaja Yoga, I don’t understand. Everything must be convenient, it must be on Saturday, Sunday, and on top of that as soon as the program is over, we will run away because we need to go to the office the next day. You will go, everything will be fine, but if you rush, I will stop you at the ghat of Khandala. But all these little games, these mischievous acts, how much ever I do, until this enters your intellect, what is the use? So, I am desiring to somehow bring you on the right path. If you keep slipping off the path, how much effort will I have to take? and all your powers, which can awaken and flourish itself, grow itself, they all will be wasted. So, first you must refine yourself. You must understand the glory of your own Powers and realize how many Powers we have and how many we can attain. We can rise so high. We have so much to offer others. All this treasure is within us, it has all opened, the key is in our hands, and now we just need to take it out and share it with others, and just enjoy it. The worship of Power that is happening today, I want you to understand that it should be the worship of your own Power. The one that will make you become completely sincere and true in your devotion. Saints and sages never had to be told anything. They were beaten, poisoned, no matter what happened, their dedication never wavered. Now you all have been connected, but the connection is so weak that it needs to be established again and again. It gets disconnected because of various things, and you need to reconnect. So, now you have to think that we have to awaken all the powers within us, then there will be no shortage, you will have no question. It is very easy. The only thing required is dedication. The one who has dedication, who completely immerses themselves in Sahaja Yoga, whose attention is always drawn towards Sahaja Yoga, will find their well-being. But first, proper union needs to be established, and half-hearted union is of no use. You will neither be here nor there. That’s what will happen.

A small seed has the Power to create thousands of trees. So, you are a human being, the owner of thousands of such trees. And you also have the power to empower thousands of them. But, after that seed gets sprouted, you throw it on the road and neglect it, the tree will not grow, then its Power will become dormant. Therefore, you must fully understand what you are and what you are doing, and how far you can reach. With this, quarrels among each other, small petty issues, such things which even roadside people don't do, rudeness, all this will collapse by itself. That is not going to survive. But, your true, beautiful form will emerge. And people will say that this is a powerful man standing. A special type of man is standing. Is a great someone. His entire behavior is so unique. He is not afraid of anyone, he is fearless. Where it has to be said, he says, where it is not to be said, he does not say. Now you want that he should get it, father should get it, father’s grandfather should get it, it cannot happen. They do not have the same capability as you. They are unworthy. Leave those unworthy, what is there to fight with them. There is no need to fight with the unworthy. It was your ill fate that you got married to an unworthy, just think that, it was your ill fate that you got an unworthy father and mother. Those who are unworthy, why bring them in Sahaja Yoga forcefully and make them sit on my head that ‘Mother, please make them alright because she is my wife, he is my father, my grandfather.’ I have no relation with them. If they are not in Sahaja yoga then you please keep those worthless outsides. Make friends with worthy people every day and enjoy them. What do you need? But what we do not understand is that this world and these relationships continue like this. There is nothing in that. Yes, if the person with whom you have company can get up with you, can walk with you, can be with you then it is fine. Otherwise, there is no need to bring such worthless people into Sahaja Yoga. And I see very incompetent people sometimes come to Sahaja Yoga through this relationship and I get a big headache.

You had dignity, that is why you came and you attained Sahaja Yoga. You were blessed. You have achieved a lot and you can achieve more. And what is the meaning in giving to a beggar? Now he is a beggar and also has a hole in his bag, what is the use of giving more to him? So, it has multiple defects. There’s no need to maintain relationships with such people. There’s no need to talk to them. Let them speak whatever they want. If their mind gets straightened, they will come and join Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise, why should you waste your mind? It’s of no use. These people have heads like stones; they can't see anything. So, from today, we need to think that we are individuals, and we have attained this because of the actions (karma) from our past lives. Because we performed good deeds, we are sitting in this position today, and we can reach even higher positions. Therefore, don't carry such heavy stones behind you and dive into the ocean. If you know how to swim, then swim freely and enjoy it. Immerse yourself in all your Powers. Today, I offer my infinite blessings for all the dormant Powers within you to awaken, and that as they gradually awaken, you feel them. And enjoy the special streams of flow that flow from within it.

This is my infinite blessing to all of you.
