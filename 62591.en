Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot organise it, we cannot conceptualise it, and at the level of human awareness we cannot know it.

Whatever I am going to tell you today, you should not believe blindly, but please keep your mind open like a scientist. In case, say, the hypothesis I put before you, and if it is spiritually right in all honesty, I hope you will accept it.

You have to reach the state of human awareness. But not yet we have reached the state of absoluteness. If all of us had felt the absolute truth, then there would have been no problem. But there are so many ideologies and people are divided in the name of God as well. If there is one God, then why should there be so many differences? Why should people fight? Because we are sitting in the darkness of ignorance. We cannot relate to each other. So there is something to happen within ourselves, that we have to have some transformation. Within us is placed the mechanism which works out this transformation.

The mechanism which is shown in this diagram, you can see it. In the triangular bone, which is called as Sacrum, there is a power which is called as Kundalini in Sanskrit language. She is called as ‘Asis’ in Quran, and She is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us. Holy Ghost is the primordial Mother power.

Now this power is the power of pure desire within us.

As you know the law of economics is that the desires or the wants are not satiable in general. We have one desire, say for example, to say, have a car, but then you have another desire. Once we get the car, we want to buy something else. So we jump from one desire to another.

Whether you know or not, we have a very strong desire within us and that is that we should get united with this all-pervading power of love.

The truth is very simple. The first thing is, that you are not this body, you are not this mind.  You are not your intelligence nor your emotions. You are not your ego or your conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit and when you become the Spirit, then you know the second truth that is, there is an all-pervading power of love. This all-pervading power of love does all the living work. For example, these flowers that we see come out of very small seeds. We do not even think how these flowers, such beautiful colours, the fragrance, have come out of a small little seed. We take it for granted. But all this work is done by that power which we describe as the all-pervading power of divine love.

This is the power of the Holy Ghost, and when you feel it, then you are surprised that it moves in your hands like cool waves of breeze. So far you have never felt it. You have never known the existence of it. But it is very simple to awaken this, and to become the Spirit, so that you can feel this power. As if this instrument when it is not connected to the mains has no meaning, our life also as human beings have no meaning, unless and until we are connected to the mains.

This Kundalini, the one which is in three and a half coil, rises to six centres above. And the last centre which is below the Kundalini looks after our excretions, also our sex. It has nothing to do with our ascent. Kundalini is above that centre. When She rises above these six centres, She nourishes them. These six centres look after our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. That is why, as a result of awakening of this Kundalini, you spontaneously get cured of any physical and mental problems. Don’t have to take any medicines, don’t have to go to doctors. Then when She comes out of your fontanel bone area, you get the actualisation of baptism –actualisation.

It is nothing artificial, and you cannot pay for it. How much do we pay Mother Earth for giving us these beautiful flowers? God does not understand money and you cannot purchase divinity. All those people who collect money in the name of God and live on that, are really sinners. They have no business to do that. But we are ignorant and they take full advantage of us. If tomorrow, Christ comes on this Earth, how will you recognise Him? He will not take any money from you. And how will you find out that He is the Christ? Because you are not yet at that stage where you can feel the truth.

So now you have to think or desire to have your self-realisation. That is when your Spirit comes into your attention. Then your attention becomes enlightened. Then it is the source of all the knowledge. The absolute knowledge. Then you can find out on your fingertips what is wrong with you, on your centres. You can also find out what is wrong with another person. If you know how to correct, then you can cure yourself and you can correct others also. This attention goes on purifying you automatically, because there is light. Supposing you are holding a snake in your hand, and there is darkness. If I tell you there is a snake, you might say that, “This is just a rope.” You won’t throw it away till it bites you, but if there is light, then you will throw it away yourself. That is how you become your own guide, your own master.

Also, you have within yourself the centre of peace. When the Kundalini rises above this centre, goes into the limbic area, then you feel absolutely peaceful, otherwise our attention is moving on the periphery of a wheel. But then we enter into the axis of our attention, which is all peaceful and we enjoy that peace in the state of thoughtless awareness where we are very aware, but we do not think. If you want to think you can think, but if you do not want to think, you need not think. Many people have foundations of peace, all kinds of pretentions in the name of peace. Many people have won noble prizes in peace, but within themselves there is no peace. I have seen, some of them they are very hot tempered. I do not know how they got this noble prize. So this peace is within ourselves, which we achieve spontaneously.

The highest of all is that we start watching everything without reacting. That is how we achieve a state by which you know everything, or I should say we enjoy everything. Say for example there is very nice piece of cloth here, done so well by some artist. If we look at it, normally we start thinking, what a nice piece. How much one must have paid, how much you have to pay, how we get money, should we insure it? If it is ours it is a headache. If it is somebody else’s then we start thinking how are we going to acquire it? But the poor artist has made this with such joy. It is completely lost in our thought, but when we are watching it without thought, beyond thought, then all the joy the artist has put into it just starts pouring on you, from both the sides and starts absolutely soothing it down.

Thoughts start and then end up, again another thought starts and ends up. Between these two thoughts, there is a little space which is the present, but we live on the cusp of these thoughts, sometimes in the future, sometimes in the past. But when the Kundalini rises, She makes these thoughts very lean and there is a big gap and we remain in the present. Because past does not exist and future we do not know. Present is the reality. So all the dynamism of the present starts working in us and a person becomes extremely dynamic, extremely healthy and at the centre is extremely compassionate. He transcends all the limitations of human thinking. He transcends beyond all the races, all the visions, all the ideas that human beings have created and becomes really righteous. Because when you see this main part (on subtle system chart), this is the one which is created as ten valencies for us. These are ten commandments you can say, within ourselves. So these commandments get awakened, and when they get awakened we really become righteous, really!

One way we are Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anything, but they can commit any sin. No one can, no one can be bounded by their so called religion they follow. So because innately, this religion that is within us which is a real religion is not awakened. Carbon has 4 valencies while human beings have 10 valencies, and when they are awakened, you become – actually you become. It is not a question of thinking or dealing something, but actually inside yourself you become a righteous person. What we call, you become a real saint, as they say in Sanskrit language, ‘Dvija,’ means twice born, like a bird. Like a bird is an egg and then it becomes a bird. In the same way, we also are first human beings and then we become enlightened souls, and what do we become with that? We become collectively conscious, our consciousness develops a new awareness.

I am sorry some people had to leave, but they will come back again and they will also get realisation. Actually this is God’s work, there cannot be any danger in it.

Now again, those who do not want to have their self-realisation can leave the hall. Because it cannot be forced. Because I respect your freedom. As you have to enter into total freedom, where nothing can dominate you, no bad habits, no bad thoughts, nothing that you do not like can dominate you. So for that total freedom, I expect your freedom, and unless and until you desire this and asking for your self-realisation, I cannot give you. So it is about ten minutes procedure which we will follow and I am sure you will all get your realisation. Now somebody will show you how we have to nourish our centres ourselves. Now we have two powers within us which I could not tell you about because we are short on time. One is on the left side, another is on the right side. The left side power is the power of desire which looks after the left sympathetic nervous system. And the right side power is the power of action, which looks after our physical and mental activities. And the left side looks after our emotional side. So, symbolically you put the left hand on your lap towards myself. You can keep it on your lap. Then we put our right hand on the heart. In the heart resides the Spirit. Then we put our right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen on the left hand side, we are only working on the left hand side. And then we take down our right hand to the lower portion of our abdomen. This is the centre of pure knowledge that manifests on your central nervous system by which you operate all divine laws, by which you become collectively conscious. Then you raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre of your master, that you become your own guide. Then you raise your right hand on your heart.

Then you have to put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and you are to turn your head to the right. This centre catches when you feel guilty. After all, you are a human being and if you have committed these things, it is alright, because this divine power has the capacity to dissolve all your mistakes. Because it is the ocean of forgiveness. You are not to feel guilty at all. Now you have to put your right hand on your forehead and put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say that you forgive everyone. You forgive everyone in general. Some people say it is difficult to forgive, but whether you forgive or do not forgive you do not do anything. But if you do not forgive, then you get into wrong hands.

Now you take back your hand to the back side of your head and raise your head as far as possible, as back as possible. This is the centre where, for your own satisfaction, without feeling guilty, without thinking of your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from this power of love.

Now, stretch your palm fully and put your centre of your palm on top of your head in the centre. Is on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in our childhood. Now put down your head, push back your fingers fully so there is a hard pressure on your scalp. This is very important. Now move your scalp seven times towards the clockwise.

That is all we have to do. Now at the very outset, I have to say there are three conditions. The first condition is that you are not to feel guilty. You have to forgive yourself fully. Forget the past. The second condition is that we have to forgive everyone in general. This you do not have to think about every individual. And the third condition is that you have to be self-confident, that you all can get self-realisation. Should not have any diffidence about yourself. Do not look at people who tell you, you are sinners. You are not. Christ has done everything for us. He has suffered for it. We have to just awaken, that is all. So please do not think that you are sinners, you have done mistakes. Forget it. At this moment, you are all going to enter into the Kingdom of God. So you should be very presently placed towards yourself. After all, human beings are the epitome of evolution. And a little breakthrough is needed, little gentle is to be done. So do not get conditioned by what others have told you about yourself. Have full confidence.

Now there is one request, if you can take out your shoes this Mother Earth helps us a lot. Need not take out socks, only the shoes. Because shoes are tightly on there.

Now you have to close your eyes and you can take away your spectacles if you like. If you are wearing tight in the neck or tight on the waist. You have to be very comfortable in the sense, you should not bend too much or stretch yourself too much, but be comfortable. Sahaja Yoga is very comfortable, you do not have to go any ‘malaya’ (mountain) and stand there on one leg. The divine power is very anxious that you should all get your realisation.

So now please put your left hand towards Me and just close your eyes. Please do not open till I tell you. Please put both your feet apart from each other, if you are sitting on a chair, but if you are sitting on the ground it is alright. Now please close your eyes, put left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart.

Now if you want to call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whichever way you want to do. Now you have to say a very fundamental question, ask a very fundamental question to Me in your heart. Please ask three times in your heart, “Mother am I the Spirit?” Now if you are the Spirit, you are your master, you are your guide.

Now please take your hand to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, and press it hard. So here you press it hard and ask Me a question three times, “Mother am I my own master?” Please put the (left) hand on your lap, not towards Me. Left hand on your lap. Now here you ask a question three times, “Mother am I my own master?”

I have already told you that I respect your freedom, and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. Now take down your hand on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, and here you ask Me a question. “Mother please may I have pure knowledge? Mother please give me pure knowledge.” Say it six times, because this centre has got six petals. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising, so we have to nourish our upper centres with our self-realisation.

So now please raise your right hand in the upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say with full confidence ten times, “Mother I am my own master.” Say it ten times.

I have already told you that the greatest truth about you, that you are the Spirit, and you have to become the Spirit, otherwise you cannot enjoy life. By becoming the Spirit, you become the instrument of God, and this great divine power of love starts flowing through you. So raise your right hand on your heart and say with full confidence, “Mother I am the Spirit.”

This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and blessings, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and you cannot commit any mistake which cannot be dissolved by this. So now raise your right hand to the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and put your head to your right. Here again you have to say with full confidence sixteen times, “Mother I am not guilty at all.” Please say it from your heart and believe Me you are not guilty. If you do not say it properly, Kundalini won’t pass through this centre.

Now raise your hand onto your forehead and put down your head please. Here again I have told you that whether you forgive or do not forgive, you do not do anything, but if you do not forgive, you play into wrong hands. If you do not forgive everyone in general, this centre is the very constricted one, and you have to awaken Christ in this centre. So now say it from your heart, “I forgive everyone in general.” Not how many times, but from your heart.

Now take back your hand to the backside of your head and push back your head fully. At this centre, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to say, “Oh divine power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.” Say it from your heart, not how many times, say it from your heart.

Now the last centre, you have to stretch your palm fully, and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, it was a soft bone as a child. Now push back your fingers, that is important, push back your fingers and put down your head fully. Now press it hard, your scalp, and now move it several times slowly, but I cannot force on you self-realisation. I respect your freedom. So just while moving your hand you have to say seven times, “Mother, please give me self-realisation.” Please move it clockwise with the pressure.
