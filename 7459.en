Media interview. Brisbane Airport (Australia), 5 April 1991.

condition like Queenstown's Gorbachev - Ah?

He is a realized soul. He's born a realized soul. It's a, it's a state of mind which is spiritual and where your spirit is in your attention. So in that light you see wisdom. You're compassioned and you're very sensible and dynamic and you do not [UNCLEAR - DETER?] for using it. Apart from that it gives you a great concern for the masses and you don't mind rectifying anything that is wrong and also you feel very, - I should say, powerful - the power of love. - Right. Do You think Gorbachev - has all these qualities? - I think, he has many.

I'm going to meet him this time when I go there. I mean, I've been missing him and he's been missing Me - it's like that but he has seen the point quite alright that this kind of an extreme regimentation of communism he doesn't have. Also he sees the point, what's wrong with democracy so he doesn't want to go to that extent of democratic life like America is, where it's complete abandonment and they have got so many problems because of this kind of freedom which is just licence. So he's a biased person and he's very righteous in his own character - extremely righteous man. Like a, you see, I should say that, Socrates says, described that, "We should have benevolent kings," you see. So he believes in benevolence and the way how he has uh.. crossed all these hurdles one by one, - is very surprising. - Hmm and he's probably changed the world more than any other person. - Yes, he's so courageous. - [UNCLEAR] - He's very courageous and whenever I go to Russia - I mean, you'll be amazed to know that there are 16000, 14000 people - we always take a stadium and I always talk about him. Nobody objected to what I said about him.

He has that leadership in him but is for the world to understand how we have to change ourselves and come to some middle point - not to go to extremes of anything. He also is very spiritual - very spiritual man and he arranged lots of yoga seminars there, he called lots of people from outside, everything but it so happened that when I was there, he was not there sometimes. - You will see him next time. - Yeah, of course. What do You, how do You judge somebody's spiritual, whether they're very spiritual or not? - Is it a feeling You get or? - No, you see, everybody has Divinity within themselves. Everybody is spiritual but only thing is that when you get connected to that All-Pervading power then you start emitting cool vibrations from your being which can be felt on your Central Nervous system. - Yeah. - You can feel on your - finger-tips.

finger-tips but for Me I can just feel it as it is. - Can You feel from other people? - Yeah, yes, just like that. You see, as soon as I saw Gorbachev on the television, I said, "We've done it now." So you have to have uh.. that kind of sensitivity, just to judge it but otherwise all of them can judge it. If they ask just a question, "Is Gorbachev a realized soul?" it works. - Really? - Yeah. You can ask the question and they get the cool breeze in their hands.

My! Okay. - Because you get the Absolute answers because you, Spirit is the Absolute - it gives you Absolute [UNCLEAR]; All of them will feel the same way about it also and I think, now in the world there is an awakening going on that we should take to Spiritual life - everywhere. But I was surprised that in Russia, where they never talked of God, never talked of religion, how people are so clean! Because they have no conditionings. You see, we have conditionings of this religion and this and that and they have deviated from right paths - they have deviated. They are not on the right paths, you see. Whatever was preached by their Incarnations or say, prophets or anyone - they didn't carry on that. Is it because they had some sort of religious innocence because they haven't had - religion wasn't legal? - [UNCLEAR] - You see, it is because it went into the hands of people who are really not authorised.

Christ has said that, "You're to be born again," that means something has to happen to you. But they did not try that. You see, they just started, "Alright, we'll organize now." Without having that connection how can you do it? - My! Have You, have You met the Queen? - Yeah, of course I've met her. - Yeah. How did You feel who was spiritual? She's a very sweet person, extremely sweet, very humble, very sweet, nice person and she has tendencies towards Spirituality, no doubt and I'm going to meet now Prince of Wales when I'm going to England.

He wants to meet Me for some purpose. Then I'll [UNCLEAR - SEE IF SHE?] comes to sahaja yoga. She's a very open-minded lady, extremely open-minded. and she has respect [UNCLEAR] feels free for discussions. Right! Other members of Your family are there any restrictions [UNCLEAR - STAND OFFICE?] - uh.. being Your Spiritual people - Even the, this gentleman from New Zealand Cowley, he was quite spiritual but I don't know he fell into some sort of a social problem - - of conscience problem something - he's also another one. - Amazing! [UNCLEAR] - [UNCLEAR - YEAH?]

Yes. Even our Rajiv Gandhi is but he also feel a trap into wrong advice, perhaps - he's also a realized soul. Even the uh.. head of the new party that's coming up, he's also a realized soul. - So many are kind of like that, I don't know how. - Unnh! - Have You met our pope? - I haven't met him as yet. - Yeah. Have You met any [UNCLEAR] with the Australian politicians? - Not of that level.

No - All those [UNCLEAR - WHO ARE?] in My husband's office, mostly shipping people [UNCLEAR] shipping, they're changing so fast - even by the time I come here, they're changed. - [LAUGHTER] May be that when You come next time [UNCLEAR] You can't just locate them. I want to meet - they're changed. - I can believe that. And what about American Presidents? Do any stand out in Your - Abraham Lincoln, of course. He was great, no doubt, very great. Lenin was also, you'll be surprised, was a realized soul but they dragged him into party and they also What he said was, "We should achieve at stateless state," that's absolutely what we are doing - stateless state. People should be just angelic - doesn't become like that, you have to be that state.

Even I feel, the most of her laws are for angels, not for ordinary persons. - And you worked, when you were young, with Gandhi. - Yes, I did. - What was he like? - He's wonderful person. He was so concerned about people, concerned about our country, for instance, Independence - a very Spiritual personality and he knew Me what I was and he consulted Me at a very young age about his bhajans, you see, the hymns, how to write, in what series he should write. But very disciplined fellow, very extremely disciplined and he wanted everybody to be very disciplined and he said, "We have to win the freedom and for that we have to be disciplined." And he said, "First thing first. First we must have our freedom. Without freedom, what is Spirituality of a slave."

So, if he was living, he would have definitely worked with us but [UNCLEAR] - And this Mister - Do you have questions? - Till I am doing with her, - I have to think of some more - you see. - [UNCLEAR] that's okay. - Yeah, beautiful! - he also [UNCLEAR] - He was a realized soul. - Was he? - Yeah, he was definitely a realized soul. Tremendous person! The thing with, with realized souls in politics, Shree Mataji, You often said is this, that they have the vision that unrealized people don't. Lenin had the vision of collectivity, Marx [UNCLEAR] had the vision of saving the soul of humanity their receptive races of militists - this vision we get through realization - isn't it?

Yes, of course, I mean, they have not only vision but they have the Absolute Truth with them and they are so wedded to it - innately they get wedded to the Truth. Said, they will not do all these nonsensical things that politicians are doing because they're not insecured, they're not counting their merits what position they occupy so they're not bothered about this maintaining the position - they'll be there, in any case, whatever one may try. And their apart from the collective vision, you see, they can penetrate into problems much better than anybody else can because they see the problems from a detached mind; - They're not involved into it so they can solve it much better. - Right. - You've met, You've met the pope, didn't You? - I did. - The recent pope, the last one? - The last one. - The last one? Right.

I met him because we had gone to Poland and I said, "I would like to see some churches," because I'm fond of architecture so they sent Me to Krakow where he was there and they held a mass for Me because I was supposed to be VIP and all that and then after that we had tea together. We're sitting, I raised his Kundalini and all that. It came up, it worked out but again it settled back. He asked Me about India, this, that but nothing about Spirituality. So sometimes it again comes up, goes down. Then I wrote a letter to one of the boys that, "I met a gentleman, a cardinal there and I saw the black [UNCLEAR], because I was there in September and very bad - time that September was when the 1st of September [UNCLEAR - WARSAW?] was bombed. - Ah, yes, right. So while going to Warsaw I felt extremely sad and I said, "Why I feel so sad here?" My husband said, "Why are You looking sad?"

I said, "Never I feel that sad as I'm feeling now." Then we got down we found out that it was the day that was bombed. And 8th of September is the birth of Mother Mary so they have a black Madonna. They take out a procession - I saw that also and that's the time I met this pope. Then this gentleman I had written this letter, because he was also born on 8th of September, so I had just written to him. - He said that, "Do You know, the same gentleman now has become the pope?" - Interesting. - Do birth dates have a special - Yes, of course, it's quite a lot. Birthday is very significant about anyone but specially for people for spiritual [UNCLEAR - BLISS or BLESSING?] They're born at a time when certain stars are there and there's some truth in it.

They have predicted about Me quite a lot and it'll see now - We heard that the other day Shree Mataji - They did - Yes [UNCLEAR] - [UNCLEAR] things, annh? - Let us see it works out. - What have they predicted? I mean, that sahaja yoga will spread such a lot and people will be changed and transformation will take place and that even politics will take over sahaja yoga and all that - quite a lot, I mean. - [UNCLEAR - CHHETI?] I'll give you a copy of that - and this man who has done it he's not a sahaja yogi and he himself is now surrendered because when he saw My horoscope. There are horoscopes and horoscopes. There's one predicted with somebody who - what was the - Krishnamurthy and according to him they calculated something. Now he's this one, R.V. Raman who is a very well-known uh.. astrologer - he's no more.

According to his astrology, this gentleman, Mr. Bhandari - he's also well-known - has predicted all these things. 'Sahaja yoga will become the, the principal belief system of the world - Yeah, that's what he said. - In certain stages.' 1996 was a very big stage. - Yeah. I think, 1993 is also important as I'll be 70 years of age that time. - Two years more. - I wouldn't admit that's [UNCLEAR] - [LAUGHTER] Shree Mataji doesn't look [UNCLEAR - THAT OLD?] I don't know anything about it, it's just like that is, I don't know - What, when You started this? In 1970 You decided that You wanted to - help enlighten [UNCLEAR].

No, this was actually from My very childhood I knew I had to do this work - Did You? - because formally, you see, it was the tradition that only one master will have one disciple but in the 12th century there was one great saint in India called as Gyaneshwara. He took permission from his guru - his brother himself was the guru - that, "You just allow me to write about it openly because everybody's said about it but nobody's said how it will work out so why not let me, at least, write something about it." So he was the first who wrote it in a book called 'Gyaneshwari', which is actually a book on Gita. In that he wrote in the sixth chapter that, "There is a power like this which will rise and which will give Self-realization and things like that." This was written in many Sanskrit books long time back. It's 14000 years back Markandaya wrote, I mean, so it's a very old theme, worked out by very few people but in our own language like Marathi or Hindi which we speak, it was not available. So he's the first one who told to the masses about this and it had to be worked out in such a way to be proved. So, when I was born I knew this was My own mission. My father also knew; He was also a realized soul, so he told Me that, "Don't talk about religion, don't talk about anything, just now You find out how to give realization to masses, not one but to masses."

So then, I used to - "So they, they also can do it, enter into Your being, You see what's wrong with You, what's wrong with him, what's wrong." So then I worked out. Till 47 years of age I was busy finding out. Then I worked it out what is the permutation and combination is. Now the last center was not opened, all of them were open. Kundalini, I could do it, with that the last was to be opened out. That I did on the 5th May, 1970 on the [UNCLEAR]. That time I saw this horrible Rajneesh, you see, mesmerising people. By chance I was there just to see what is here. When I saw that, you see, just I thought better start it now.

So first I gave realization to only one lady, then to one gentleman and then twelve people got realization. That's how slowly it started. Gosh! and how many people would have received realization now? What do you think, in the world - how many would there be? - I don't know. At least tens of thousands, pushing a hundred thousand - - maybe more than a hundred thousand - God knows - Bad at accounts. Can't just say because this is sahaja yoga is not a communication, it's not an organization - it is how way you practice it - you just can't say how many practice it. This, this ability, I've never heard about it that You talk, to look into people and find out what's wrong with them; I mean, You can do this. - Well, all of them can do.

All of us can do. We can read the chakras on our hands - On their hands they can - The sensations we get..... - That's what is Collective Consciousness which Hume has talked about - you must have heard about Hume. - Yeah - Hume has talked about it - Yeah - That's same thing, same thing that you develop that new awareness, a new dimension - in your awareness on your Central Nervous System - When You're going to Beta uh.. how many people get into Beta - waves they can do this - is that alright? - Yes. We've had some studies done recently Shree Mataji that article, we've got copies in the paper - in fact [UNCLEAR] that the symptomatic of the study meditation state is the [UNCLEAR] Beta emanation and there is other things that go on with it. - Essentially what happens is that when the Kundalini is raised you are then in meditation - Well and how much you develop that and how much you learn to use that awareness, is then up to you. So that's kind of two questions as who has had their Kundalini raised, which could be hundreds of thousands of people on earth and they could have done nothing more with it that is surprised more in number than actually stuck to it. They meditate everyday, learn how to use their finger chakra mood swing system and actually increase their sensitivity to the extent that they're now vibrationally aware in everyday. This is what Shree Mataji teaches us to work on very much to develop our awareness so that we can receive [UNCLEAR] much through vibrations [UNCLEAR] rather than through other means It works both ways - you see, we have to feel our depth so like a tree has to grow outward, the same way when you start working on others you start moving outwards and depth starts increasing and once you touch your Divinity within you, then you're there - no problem. - Yeah, right.

[LAUGHTER] - I'm only sorry that I'm meeting her after such a long time. I've been here many a times, you see and I wish we could have met earlier we would have done such a lot for Australia. - Hopefully it can happen now. - Unnh? - We hope it can happen now. - It should. I mean, first of all there were so many horrible gurus here; You had so many horrible people working. Even now, I think, there are some already at it. One thing you must tell them that you cannot pay for your ascent. It's a living process of a living energy of evolution and you can't pay for that.

Now, you may pay for a house or for a aeroplane tickets, that's different but you can't pay for this. What stage would You feel that You've achieved Your goal? Will it be when, when how many people are received realization? With that in two stages we move. First stage is we call as thoughtless awareness where you can silence your thoughts and you can watch, just watch - that's you are in the present now, neither in the past nor in the future. Then this state develops into another state, what you call as, doubtless awareness - then you have no doubts about [UNCLEAR], no problems and you yourself know that this is so; The certificate comes from you, from no body else. Everybody has improved like that, everybody; Even Jason, ask him, he will also tell you the same. I wonder whether I, this is a very hypnotic way, isn't it? [LAUGHTER] Yes, yes, it's a very nice hypnotism [LAUGHTER] So, in hypnosis, you see, you actually put some sort of a spirit in the person. There's no modus operandi - you don't know how it has happened but in sahaja yoga you know each and everything; How the Kundalini rises, where is the Kundalini, how to raise it, what's the problem of a particular person.

It's the Parasympathetic Nervous System which you nourish about which doctors don't know anything. So, if you talk to a doctor will understand or an engineer will understand that this is complete engineering. So the modus operandi is completely explained and proved. It's not just talking, it's proved. Now supposing, some people say there's no God. Alright, doesn't matter - raise their Kundalini. Ask a question, "Is there God?" - finished. Then the cool breeze says yes. But supposing, there's a cheat and you say, "Is he Godly?"

Immediately you might feel hot, sometimes you get a blister with such a person. Relatively you should see. Supposing, there's a cancer patient. I put My hands towards a cancer patient - immediately you'll feel the heat of the cancer patient. That's how you can find out what's wrong with this person, what's wrong with another person. Now only thing, if you know how to correct those centers, person is cured. - If you know how to - correct those subtle centers - Right - which are indicated on your finger-tips - Right. - then if you know how to do that through the awakening of the Kundalini, then you cure that person. [UNCLEAR] reasons we can work on each chakra to clear out dead energy, maybe blocked energy in the chakra nad get it into working - and the state of the chakra is the origin of disease or health - hmm - [UNCLEAR] so we can work on the chakras and [UNCLEAR] So now for hypnosis, supposing I hypnotize him, supposing, he won't be able to tell you what it is [UNCLEAR] about. He will not have any knowledge about it and it's such a subtle knowledge but you ask any sahaja yogi, they all know about it.

They know how to work it out, they know how to give awakening, they know how to cure, they know everything. Such a subtle subject has become so easy for them because they have that light, I can say, and that understanding, that feeling by which they can judge it. - Can I, can I ask Your followers, You - Annh? - what difference it's made to their life? Do they.. - Yes, please ask. - Can you tell me what difference it made to your life? - [UNCLEAR] - How's it [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] and then you just get it very mild [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] and I would just see [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] but then [UNCLEAR] - Is he married? - Is it different? - Yeah because children were in trouble, you see - they had children [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] So you have two children to start with and another two with the second marriage and now he's got four children. - Right!

[UNCLEAR] - Probably he's different. - Jason, what's it done for you? - I was [UNCLEAR] that chakra, was a functioning alcoholic, - slowly, well not very slowly, ceasingly function, I was pretty neurotic, I believed that politics was another way to approach life for one thing - was a fairly neurotic belief. Umm, I don't belief it now [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] - and - very hot-tempered he is. - very hot-tempered - I was hot-tempered, that's true and almost corrigible now - touch wood - that's only plastic - and altogether gave up alcohol and tobacco the first day, I gave up politics a few months thereafter - I needed it a little bit this way umm - and then for eleven years, I suppose about, 5 - 8 % I stopped temper [UNCLEAR] - still a little bit there but I mean, the transformation [UNCLEAR] out of me. It's final, I feel that I am now lot more peaceful, I'm working lot more better. Since I got realization [UNCLEAR] university, I got a degree uh.. had two changes of career now starting to [UNCLEAR]. My intelligence is working measurably better, I'm emotionally a lot happier. I mean, there's kind of all ordinary human things but difficult to quantify, probably inside find out that the improvement is several thousand percent. [UNCLEAR] getting realization without following the teachings of Shree Mataji, without letting Her look after me, through just doing what She says, doing what She buys us, it's slower that frequently but nonetheless, despite me being slow in following Shree Mataji's advices, still works which shows that the Kundalini is tremendously powerful, easily even overcomes the resistance of people with a lot of conditioning, a lot of ego and a lot more temper.

So, I mean, for me there is... - But also how many of your friends in Brighton, I mean, just imagine, they were gone cases absolutely - drug [UNCLEAR] - hippies and all kinds of people from Brighton came in - ruined, completely ruined brain - oh my, absolutely recluses, you can call them, recluses - Yes - Paul Winter, just imagine, now he's one of the very rich persons there and he's doing very well there, he discovered somethings and I mean, you can't believe. And some people were from Oxford and Cambridge and London School of Economics - very highly educated - all into drugs. It was just a fashion - all into drugs - and they had become like cabbages. I tell you once when they came to Me some of them said they couldn't even see Me. They saw some sort of light, this, that and all of them - are absolutely alright and doing very well - [UNCLEAR] good one! - so many of them. - and they just - alcoholics - they stop alcohol, drugs, smoking, I mean, all these things, the easy things just one minute [UNCLEAR] inside just drops away [UNCLEAR] Real idea is just to do that [UNCLEAR] this is an enormous growth. I mean, think of all the millions of dollars have been spent on trying to give up smoking No, there is one Dr. Wells, you see, who was an alcoholic and also drug addiction but not so much as alcoholism and such a qualified man just wasted and Rustom brought him to Me. Another doctor he's head of the Psychiatry department in Amaan - he brought him to Me and I looked at him and I said, "Now look at this man such a educated, such a good person just lost." Out of frustration in his family and this and that he took to drugs.

And when he became alright - now today he is in charge of seven hospitals in London. - He is business expert on addiction therapy - And he's working on that. - And I told him,"What do you do?" He said, "I come home and give them bandhans, that's all." [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] He's curing people so everybody has tremendous respect for him - because you cannot cure people but he works out sahaja yoga. - It's interesting.Have you had a...? Well I, was working as a Job Assistant in [UNCLEAR] stress [UNCLEAR] and I had my realization [UNCLEAR] and I used to go [UNCLEAR] every night [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] was very nice I was just there on [UNCLEAR] - How would you [UNCLEAR]? - I don't know I'm too [UNCLEAR] what's wrong - And also you must mention how you love each other - that's very important. But we have people from, say, this time we had people from 56 nations for our seminar in India and the way they love each other, I mean, we never have a problem, never. They love each other, they look after each other.

I mean, like universal brotherhood has been established. To see that I felt so very happy. We had Russians, we had Bulgarians, Romanians, uh.. we had people from East Germany, also from Hungary, Czechoslovakia - all this Western Bloc had also come plus we had people from all over like Columbia and I mean, all the rest of it and the South American group and the North American group - like that fifty-six nations and - Just an [UNCLEAR] - Yes. My husband says he works for the United Nations and he said, "I can't think of any, any organization like this. I cannot think - there's no problem, there's no argument, nothing - just enjoying each other." - Have you had an experience? - Yes, I can't say I was an extreme of anything except exquisitely I have just prior to discovering sahaja yoga had a prolapse disc which turned out to be a thing of long standing and when I; Actually, when Shree Mataji first came to Australia, I was in hospital because they [UNCLEAR] and all sorts of things to me and that I was faced with having to wear a belt around me and a catapult on my leg and also a thing on my shoe to keep my foot straight and after about nine months I, sort of, followed my doctor to see what my progress is [UNCLEAR] , "You're not going to get very much better." He said, "You know with [UNCLEAR] we can but this has been going on for 20 years and nerves are a lot of damage done, you've lost a lot of nerve function." And so there I was there with all these things - I had a stick as well and in the meantime before this meeting with the doctor, I had discovered sahaja yoga and this healing process, no doubt whatever, this is what was happening. Uh.. through the practices of sahaja yoga just continued.

I was way past the period where my healing should have cut off. Till now, I haven't got any adverse things. I can walk reasonably well - I cannot run very well. Uh.. I'm not too good at dancing forever [LAUGHTER] Apart from that it's, it's - it's virtually disappeared. - Can this be put down to power of positive thinking too much degree? - Positive thinking is a mental process. Mental process can only develop your ego - It cannot help you much because if you think positively - well, according to us we go to the right side - and the left side is neglected, which is emotions and such a person can become very dry because you can rationalize anything. The balance is not there but in sahaja yoga actually, not that you achieve balance but also complete nourishment from the Divine force. - You're actually getting an extra energy - All the time - [UNCLEAR] all the time - Yeah.

It's not only physical energy; It's physical, mental, emotional and specially spiritual and you are always joyous, always joyous and very happy person. Children are very happy they become very intelligent as well as very compassionate. It's very different world you enter into because it's all within you - you have to just touch that Divinity. Hmm, well. I cannot think anything else to ask You. [LAUGHTER] - She's [UNCLEAR] to someone else. [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] Yeah. - You can't think, that's one of the effects of thoughtlessness. - Thoughtlessness. It's thoughtlessness - no thought.

Maybe that's no more work left. - It's very normal. [UNCLEAR -THERE'S NO THOUGHT?] if you want you can think, otherwise you won't. Otherwise you are bombarded by these thoughts, you don't want to have them; They go on haunting - now you are free. - Now I am free. - Annh. - Wait a sec - free to watch. Free to what? Free to think in every way.

You see, once you get your realization, nothing is important than your being so that you don't take to any drugs; Become so powerful - nothing can touch you, nothing can dominate you - no habit - nothing. - So even I'm not going to get the [UNCLEAR] [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] - It's up to you. [LAUGHTER] - You've free choice, complete free choice. - You see, in sahaja yoga it's complete free choice. Animals have no choice; Human-beings have been given freedom to choose. Now by trial and error method they learn but still they cannot go very far. But once you get realization, the light shows them that it's wrong and you, they just don't do it. It's a simple - always I give them a analogy of a snake. Supposing, it is darkness and you are holding on to a snake and somebody tells you, "Oh, there's a snake, snake," but you won't give up. You'll say, "No, it's a rope."

In the darkness you can't argue till the snake bites you and then suddenly when you see a little flicker of light, you just drop it yourself. - So, I don't tell them, "Don't do this, don't do that." It just happens by themselves. - Right. - You become your own guide, you become your own guru - I don't have to tell you anything. You see yourself, what is benevolent for you, what is joyous for you, what is good for you. Everything you see yourself because it's all within yourself. Only like one light which is enlightened, one candle which is enlightened, can enlighten another light - that's all. But there's no uh.. nothing that has been done in such a way that you should feel obliged or nothing of the kind; It's just one light which is enlightened gives light to another. - Thank You very much.

[UNCLEAR] - May God bless you! - Thanks - May God bless you! - Can I take a couple of pictures of You with my beginner's cameras? [UNCLEAR] He's got terrific ones. - Yes, please do, please do. - Please do. There's already continuous [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] Straighten out your cameras so that the pictures are a little bit clear [UNCLEAR] and it's just much embarrassing. - Can I help? - Trying to work like My husband. I'm hopelessly bad, I mean, I've never had a camera all My life.

[UNCLEAR] It is very [UNCLEAR] It does everything automatically so I can't [UNCLEAR] it. - This automatics is what? - Yeah, automatic everything - thank goodness. - Just automatic, just like this itself - I know [UNCLEAR - THIS ONE?] - I'm sorry about that - I know this one very well - it's very good. - It's magic! - Thank you, thank you very much. - Shree Mataji, would You like some water? - Thank you. What about the lady - she may like too also.

Would you like, would you have some water? - Ahhh.. - Please have - Thank you, thank you very much. - [UNCLEAR] - Do you think if we can make it to the terminal tomorrow morning, that'll be very much, I mean - It depends whether what time do we work-wise - But only thing it should be announcement must be kept - wherever we are having the programs, so if you can give it in writing properly - Yes, Mother. - because it happened sometimes that we didn't give them and there was a confusion. - Alright I'm getting prepared for the recording. [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] Let him [UNCLEAR] Oh, I wish Your trip is very successful; Australian trip is very successful. Thank you very much. Successful Australia for you.
