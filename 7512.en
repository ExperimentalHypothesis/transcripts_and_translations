SHRI DEVI PUJA
January 26, 1984
Rahuri, INDIA
&nbsp;

Rahuri has a special significance in the history of the Goddess, that when the horrible rakshasa, called Rahu, started ruling this area and devastating it. The whole suffered, all the God-fearing people …. Then the Goddess took Her incarnation here and She killed this man, this rakshasa and there are different places where how he ran, how She caught him and ultimately killed – he was killed in Rahuri.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And that’s why rahu-ri – “ri” starts from the Hrim, as you know that: Aim, Klim, Hrim are the three words denoting the three powers of the Goddess. Aim, Hrim and Klim: Aim is the Mahakali, Hrim is the Mahalakshmi and Klim is the Mahasaraswati. So, with the Hrim-power She killed this rakshasa, and then – after that killing – bhaktas started living here. And a king came all the way from Rajpur, Rajputana – and started worshipping the Goddess.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And went – he was a poor man, he came here as a poor man – while worshipping the Goddess he raised this again into another kingdom, and that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas because they carry the shawl of the Goddess. This Shalivahanas, later on in the dynasty, was a [INDIST., SOUNDS LIKE Bhobruvaha] who fought with the [INDIST. SOUNDS LIKE Maharaja] and defeated him, who was from Ujiara [?]. Surprisingly many of My relations are still in Ujiara and they are following a new vision. So because he fought him and he captured him many people from here shifted there and settled down in Ujiara.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now this Rahuri developed gradually into a very modern city, or you can say in a modernized. And when we go to [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Nankhara] you will be able to see it. The forefathers of Mine were called as Shalivahanas and My mother`s place [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Rhaduvas] where they resided and lived. So Rahuri has a special significance in the life of Sahaja Yoga, or I should say in My own life. And that is why surprisingly that in Rahuri we have established our center in the biggest way. Because the kings here worshipped the Mother with a shawl.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now this has a special meaning as the significance goes, or you can say the symbolic - it is - it covers the modesty of the Mother.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Mother protects us, She looks after us. So this is the one which covers Her, gives Her the grace, gives Her the protection from the cold and when the children are suffering, or are tired, or are sick She covers them with the shawl. So the shawl has a very big meaning and because the used to carry the shawl of the Mother all the time in their hands, that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So the significance of Rahuri is very great and you will also see that in the gross also the people here are very receptive to Sahaja Yoga. Even the factory people – I went to see them before I came here, to talk to them. And they are so much submerged in the developments of Sahaja Yoga and amount of things they want to do, and want to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga here. As they are built for you especially too was made with great care about from that they thought that it was finished and worked very hard. Day and night, just to prepare this hall for you.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So this is how it is going to work out, and last time I told them that you should not make an alcohol out of these molasses [??] and sell it at the market at a cheap rate, but make something useful. So they are trying to find out a technique about which I talked to them now. So they are very religious people also. And they are trying to improve the lot of the people, by removing all these addictions among the people.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So that is the significance of Rahuri-Puja and that’s what it is, that you are like Shalivahanas who are worshipping the Mother and Her shawl. So today’s Puja has a special significance – that’s why Rahuri we have very good Sahaja Yogis here, very developed, very evolved, moral people. They are not scholars of Sanskrit, but they are scholars of Sahaja Yoga. There is a difference between being a scholar of Sanskrit and a scholar of Sahaja Yoga. Now for you people I hope it has been a comfortable stay for you here and we hope also for the future you are going to enjoy your journey and enjoy the bliss of the Divine!

We don’t read about Rahul`s killing, because it is Mahalakshmi who killed, but what we read in the Devi-Mahatmya is the Mahakali`s powers. But Rahul was killed here in Rahuri by Mahalakshmi, and that Mahalakshmi power is called as Hrim power, so that’s why this is Rahu-ri. Actually it is Rahu-hrim we can say it is Rahu-ri to make it simple.

And according to that calendar only all the Maharashtrians are living, which is very, I should say, much more subtler than vikram, this thing. Because in the [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: vikram-panjaga] this area is still called as Kali-Yuga, Kali-Yuga, but in this [INDIST: SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga; Then: Shalivahana-Panjaga] it is called as Krita-Yuga. It’s much subtler. That’s a very wider thing and it doesn’t give you the different sections of Kali-Yuga, that how it becomes Krita-Yuga and ultimately a Satya-Yuga.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The calendar that was used by the North Indians was the Vikram, and the South Indians used the Shalivahana, but especially in Maharashtra. But the support came mainly from [INDIST.] direct, who said this is the better [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga] because it deals with subtler side of time. Subtler side of time. And that’s why it was regarded as a greater thing. Now on the first day of this calendar they put a kalasha [? A pot] with a shawl as a banner, a kalasha and a shawl as a banner. That’s why kalash, which is the Kundalini, is the Aquarius.

&nbsp;

[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

&nbsp;

In the older days all the Maharashtrian women used to have some sort of an additional cloth, a shawl, which they used to carry. If it was a marriage then they used to have a marriage sari, [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: completed with that shawl]. All the time they had to wear something, a covering over the sari. Sari was not the end-cloth but now we have become modern, so we don’t use the, that, another cloth which one has to use. So, but this is only the custom. In India is not the point, it is not only in Maharashtra, everywhere. But there, because a dress was not a sari, but those who bore the sari did not use, in the North. But here those who use the sari also use the shawl, on top of that. And that’s why, you see, this country has a speciality, this part that they always had this shawl, whether they went out, for their protection, or they went for a marriage or anything they used to have another thing on top. Now of course we have, symbolically, something modernized. This is, wearing little pieces to be used as shawls. You see, everything is getting modernized.

You must, all right, touch the feet of this Rahuri-Land. Then after, Ganesha, we must also touch the feet. As soon as I get the land, first we establish Ganesha here, and once this land, we get everywhere in the whole world, we get land and we have no problems of any kind as far as the land is concerned. When the Ashram is built here, everywhere in the whole world we’ll have Ashrams. So the beginning has to be at the right place.
