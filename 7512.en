Rahuri has a special significance in the history of the Goddess, that when the horrible rakshasa, called Rahu, started ruling this area and devastating it, the whole suffered, all the God-fearing people. Then the Goddess took Her incarnation here and She killed this man, this rakshasa and there are different places where how he ran, how She caught him and ultimately killed. He was killed in Rahuri.
And that’s why rahu-ri – “ri” starts from the Hrim, as you know that: "Aim, Klim, Hrim" are the three words denoting the three powers of the Goddess. "Aim, Hrim and Klim": Aim, is the Mahakali, Hrim, is the Mahalakshmi and Klim, is the Mahasaraswati. So, with the Hrim-power She killed this rakshasa, and then – after that killing – bhaktas started living here. And a king came all the way from Rajpur, Rajputana, and started worshipping the Goddess.
And when he was a poor man, he came here as a poor man, while worshipping the Goddess, he raised this again into another kingdom, and that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas, because they carried the shawl of the Goddess. This Shalivahanas, later on in the dynasty, was a Babruvahan [precedent dynasty of Satavahan, Babruvahan was the father of Shalivahan] who fought Vikramaditya [a famous king] and defeated him, who was from Ujjain. Surprisingly many of My relations are still in Ujjain and they are following Hindu religion. So because he fought him and he captured him many people from here shifted there and settled down in Ujjain.
Now this Rahuri developed gradually into a very modern city, or you can say, in a modernized. And when we go to Naiakanche Shingve [the castle of Shri Mataji’s family in Shrigoan or Shingve] you will be able to see it. 
The forefathers of Mine were called as Shalivahanas and My mother`s place is the other one [Rahuri], where they resided and lived. So Rahuri has a special significance in the life of Sahaja Yoga, or I should say in My own life. And that is why surprisingly that in Rahuri we have established our center in the biggest way. Because the kings here worshipped the Mother with a shawl. Now this has a special meaning as the significance goes, or you can say the symbolic – it is – it covers the modesty of the Mother.
Mother protects us, She looks after us. So this is the one which covers Her, gives Her the grace, gives Her the protection from the cold and when the children are suffering, or are tired or sick, She covers them with the shawl. So the shawl has a very big meaning and because the used to carry the shawl of the Mother all the time in their hands, that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas.
So the significance of Rahuri is very great and you will also see that in the gross also the people here are very receptive to Sahaja Yoga, even the factory people. I went to see them before I came here, to talk to them, and they are so much submerged in the developments of Sahaja Yoga and amount of things they want to do, and want to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga here. As they have built for you especially too was made with great care about from that they thought that it was finished and worked very hard, day and night, just to prepare this hall for you.
So this is how it is going to work out, and last time I told them that you should not make an alcohol out of these molasses and sell it at the market at a cheap rate, but make something useful. So they are trying to find out a technique about which I talked to them now. So they are very religious people also. And they are trying to improve the lot of the people, by removing all these addictions among the people.

So that is the significance of Rahuri puja and that’s what it is, that you are like Shalivahanas who are worshipping the Mother and Her shawl. So today’s Puja has a special significance – that’s why Rahuri, we have very good Sahaja Yogis here, very developed, very evolved, knowledgeable people. They are not scholars of Sanskrit, but they are scholars of Sahaja Yoga. There is a difference between being a scholar of Sanskrit and a scholar of Sahaja Yoga. Now for you people I hope it has been a comfortable stay for you here and we hope also for the future you all are going to enjoy your journey and enjoy the bliss of the Divine!

We don’t read about Rahul`s killing, because it is Mahalakshmi who killed, but what we read in the Devi-Mahatmya is the Mahakali`s powers. But Rahul was killed here in Rahuri by Mahalakshmi, and that Mahalakshmi power is called as Hrim power, so that’s why this is Rahu-ri. Actually it is Rahu-hrim we can say it is Rahu-ri to make it simple.

[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

And according to that calendar [Shalivahan shak, according to King Shalivahan] only, all the Maharashtrians are living, which is very, I should say, much more subtler than Vikram, this thing [Vikram Samvat is the calendar followed in the North, according to king Vikramaditya]  Because in the Vikram Samvat, this area, era,  is still called as Kali Yuga. But in this pandjika [almanac], Shalivahana pandjika, it is called as Krita Yuga. It’s much subtler. That’s a very wider thing and it doesn’t give you the different sections of Kali-Yuga, that how it becomes Krita Yuga and ultimately a Satya Yuga.

The calendar that was used by the North Indians was the Vikram, and the South Indians used the Shalivahana, but especially in Maharashtra. But the support came mainly from  [? Mangil  Datatile, INDIST]  who said this is the better pandjika because it deals with subtler side of time, subtler side of time, and that’s why it was regarded as a greater thing. 
Now on the first day of this calendar they put a kalash [Hindi word for pitcher] with a shawl as a banner, a kalash and a shawl as a banner. That’s why "kalasha", which is the Kundalini, is the Aquarius [Age].

[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

In the older days, all the Maharashtrian women used to have some sort of an additional cloth, a shawl, which they used to carry. If it was a marriage then they used to have a marriage sari, on top of that was a shawl. All the time, they had to wear something, a covering over the sari. Sari was not the end-cloth but now we have become modern, so we don’t use the, that, another cloth which they don’t have to use. So, but this is only the custom in India, it’s not the point, it’s not only in Maharashtra, everywhere. But there, because a dress was not a sari - but those who wore the sari did not use, in the North - but here, those who use the sari also use the shawl, on top of that. And that’s why, you see, this country has a speciality, this part, that they always had this shawl, whether they went out, for a protection, or they went for a marriage or anything, they used to have another thing on top. Now of course we have, symbolically, something modernized, you see, very little pieces to be used as shawls, you see, everything is getting modernized.

[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

You must, all right, touch the feet of this Rahuri land [Shri Mataji is doing namaste]. Then after Ganesha, we must also touch it [Shri Mataji is touching the ground]. As soon as I get the land, first we’ll establish Ganesha there. And once this land we get, everywhere in the whole world, we’ll get land and we’ll have no problems of any kind as far as the land is concerned. When the Ashram is built here, everywhere in the whole world, we’ll have Ashrams. So the beginning has to be at the right place.
[Applause, Shri Mataji is doing namaste]

They have come all the way from Germany.
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi; then the Puja starts]
[during the Puja:]
Husband and wife, are you? Ha? You both are husband and wife – are you? You have to be husband and wife!
[Yogi: Yes!]
Shri Mataji: You are? You both are husband and wife?
[Yogi: Not!]
Shri Mataji: Yes!
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]
Means: the husband and wife should sit together! That’s the only time when a man and a woman sits together in this country. Not the brother. Not even sisters and brothers. Only husband and wife.
