Talk to yogis. Duhlia (India), 13 January 1983.

In India we celebrate the changing of the Sun's orbit [SURNAO ?]. He turns away from tropic of Capricorn to the tropic of Cancer. Is it so? Now? So, now the heat is going to come more in this country. So to prepare for the heat and to prepare people for that, they give little jaggery and sesami seed or sugar and sesami seed and say that "we give you sweet so you also speak sweetly", because the heat makes people rather bitter. And in that people start, if there's heat inside you, then you start talking very bitterly to each other. So to pacify that sweet, they give the sugar or the jaggery for your livers, but you can't just give that [UNCLEAR]...which is also a [SOOTHING] oil.

Now. It's very symbolic. That's all, it's a symbolic thing. And it is done every 14th of January, it starts. It is called as [Makar Sankra], the change to [Makar], means Capricorn. And [IT'S] surprising! Like in the ancient times Cancer was called as [Karkar] in India, [Karkar], and the... you also call this thing as Cancer since long. Now, the disease cancer is also called cancer. You see how it is related. And in Indian language also it is called as the disease of the Cancer, in the sense [Karkar], they call it [Karkar Ruga], you see, two words. They also...call it due to the [Karkar Ruga] and that was also called [Karkar Ruga], means heat produced. It produces heat first of all and secondly it has other meaning, that in Cancer, Cancer stands for the Mother. So when you commit sins against the Mother cancer is produced, sin against the Mother. Cancer's sign is the sign of the Motherhood. And when you try to commit sins, sins against the Mother this starts. And since my Advent, this disease has become very prevalent because sin against the Mother is the biggest sin... in the modern times. So, one must know that the sin against the Mother will lead equal to cancer. So it started from Ganesha tattwa.

Many people who have this problem, [A] Ganesha problem, they may be very good in other things but still, if there is a left Ganesha problem, they should be very, very careful. Karkar is like a hole in your being. And to overcome that problem you may cover up with something else. Like such people may say: "Oh, I am so great, I never feel like that" That's not the point. Just overcome your Ganesha problem with which you are covered it. All these perversions must be sucked in just like the tortoise sucks in the four limbs within themselves. That is how you must suck in those things and do not try to overcome by right Vishuddhi, by saying that you are great or you are this or you are that. Some people I've seen also try to show off about it and try to say things which look quite great but ultimately I find that they have a left Mooladhara. It's a serious problem. It is very serious. So be careful! Don't deceive yourself! Anyone of you. Those who have a left Mooladhara problem have to be extremely careful, not to be tempted to any supraconscious behavior or talking. Try to overcome it by a complete surrendering, say "I do not know anything, Mother "- first mantra for them. "Mother, I do not know anything". You surrender because it's a Mother. Like Shri Ganesha. He never shows off anything. He's just surrendered, completely: "I do not know", like Adi Shankaracharya, "I do not know, Mother".

The more you try to sort of express yourself logically or with your brains, then know that you are deviating from that point because that's the only way you compensate. So be careful. I'm telling all of you. It's very common in the West, I've seen. Suddenly they become all Sahaja Yogi experts and then they follow the path. So those who think that they are great Sahaja Yogis must know there is something seriously wrong with them, first of all. All have to grow together, nobody should try to show off. I know who's well. That's very important. And you need not feel jealous of such people or enamored of such people. Know that you have to be with Reality.

So left Mooladhara is a very serious problem. Be careful of it! It can be infectious, it can be just catch over. Sahaja Yoga is only that very delicate point among Western Sahaja Yogis. [ONLY ON or WHEN WE HAVE] this point [UNCLEAR] left Mooladhara. So be careful! Try to keep your attention clear. Perversions - keep away. Try to keep yourself your chakras al right. Better thing is to look after your chakras than to discuss it.

[HINDI TALK]
Who are coughing? Something definitely wrong. All this, why, why are you coughing? You are not paying attention properly. You have to look after yourselves. You are disturbing Me when I'm talking. This is something wrong. You better look after of yourselves. You have to say "Allah hu akbar" sixteen times, morning, evening [UNCLEAR]. Put yourself to test. Try to avoid eating things which are not good for your throat, make gargle. You see, sometimes people feel proud of it, [AS or AND] sometimes the way they look at it, I'm surprised. One should be ashamed. So, please, see that you look after your throats and don't disturb Me. I have done much more traveling that you had to. You know that. I've gone through too much. And apart form that you know that...I sleep very late, compared to you. If your throats are not alright, please, look after it. [THERE] must be something wrong. What's it? Some bhoots are there? It's just that. How is it it's not coming round? Better do your dhuni and [EMPTY] everything that you want to [DO] [IT'S NOTHING SO ???UNCLEAR]. It's important . How can it be? How are you getting this? All the time, all the time. So, now, I give you dhunis, this, that, finished. I've suffered much more here, I mean in the sense that I'm God. Lot of sufferings in the way that I am raising their Kundalini, everything... You know that. But to say even that there was too much test in all that, you must get used to. It's possible. On the contrary, the more you try to do it, the better you... you feel are doing a contribution to My talk. You are saints! Behave like saints! It's important.

But first... Give them ...These who have caught, put something in the mouth. And you should not cough. Give them something to eat. Look after yourselves. I should look after yourselves, big, big boys? You better look after.

Do you find anyone of the Indian Sahaja Yogis coughing? No one! Just look after yourselves. Just tell, moving your hands too much also isn't good, all the time you talk, like this. Don't do all that! Keep your hands straight. Respect! Try to steady your hands! All the time jerkiness, shifting your hands too much also is not good. Something one must understand, we have to get into Sahaja Yoga, to work it out in a serious way. Work it out! No use carrying on with the nonsenses, no use getting angry with yourself, no use also sort of saying that "I, I, I" "I don't know" "I'm this thing". It's a nonsense. "I am this, I am that, I can feel [IT]" All this is nonsense, [YOU SEE]. The supraconscious nonsense going on. Be careful! You should not try to impress others by your nonsense at all.

Then there's another thing I will tell you about. [UNCLEAR NAME OF A PERSON sounds like TRUPTA], did you say that you have to learn Sanskrit to know Sahaja Yoga? Not at all! This is absolute wrong. Please take it from Me! Again mental activity started, better stop it. All these wrong things, ideas you should not get into your head. Dumal does not [KNOW A WORD] of Sanskrit. Not a word of Sanskrit. What is there? It is all borrowed feathers? Even why borrow from Adi Shankaracharya, what is all your depth, your feelings? Why to borrow from others? Develop your own feelings, your depth, your sources instead of borrowing from any.... Why to learn Sanskrit? There's no need. You may know something about Shankaracharya, but not about Sahaja Yoga and not at all about Me. So don't go into all these tricks. Now you stop making any names or anything. Please, stop! Otherwise you'll get into supraconscious, I'm telling you. Just don't do ! All these mental activities you all must stop, [BE]cause the main problem is your left side. And tomorrow is the day when you have to decide. Tomorrow is the day when we worship the Surya, tomorrow is the day when we worship the Saraswati. So that the Saraswati should give you your exhausted energy that has passed out and now don't exhaust Her more. Use your left side. Surrender to your Mother, be good mothers, be good daughters. Alright? Surrendering is the way. And don't think too much about Sahaja Yoga. Talking chuck, chuck, chuck, about Sahaja Yoga is not the way. All such people arise nowhere. I know that. I know everyone. I know people who just think too much of Sahaja Yoga. I know them very well. They don't know anything about Me! On the feet I know! On the vibrations I know! On their development I know! There's no need at all to know Sanskrit, it's true, but it is the need to know your Mother through your love, through pure understanding. Because it will [TAKE or TELL] you because you are used to that kind of [A] thing. You want to know the whole of Sanskrit, the whole of this, the whole of that, you read the whole of Vedas. And so many are like this here in this country that are useless for Me. Good for nothing. Just forget it! Don't go into that trip of knowing through your brains. Know through your heart. And that's the reason is, because it's not available to you. That's the base. Left Mooladhara is [HA, UNCLEAR]. You look up for another thing. Just not available. That in the sense it is not available. Try to go to that. Try to awaken that within you.

And then you'll be amazed, you'll know Me better. And yesterday only [UNCLEAR] how these complications have created a barrier. They just see Me, just see the faces in the same way. Still you look so sometimes miserable, sometimes look lost, no? Because still you are using your brains. Using your brains is not the way to get to Sahaja Yoga, please. Better now your throats? You are not coughing? These were all bhoots. What has happened to you?... Don't try to cough.

But if you want to know Sanskrit, you can know. But that's not the end! And that's not the way. Of course, on your way you can know it, but that's not the way. I mean I don't want you to get to things where you are diverted from your own surrendering and ascent. That's more important. What Shankaracharya has said ultimately is already translated in English. If you see it, that he has just talked of surrender. Nothing else. He hasn't talked of anything else to start. That's it.

All these names also that you have given Me are just a part of it, Sahaja Yoga is also a part of it. I mean, why should you care of these things? Try to establish, establish that, because of that you use your brains too much. Establish to your left... Better? Be in Nirvichara! See! Where is your coughing now? Finished. They have run out! In the same way you should control. Tell them off.

Also you speak too much, while in front of Me be meditative. Don't speak. There's no need to speak. Be in meditative mood. You are with Me, I'm with you. Keep in meditative mood. It will help you. Very much help. It is here you should keep quiet. Absolutely. And feel it. No discussions, no talkings, not using brains. We have come here to gain something within for your altering. Be responsible about it. Some people definitely, Mathias, improved a lot. Tremendous. I was amazed. He [CHANGED or APPROACHED]. But some are just the same. I asked them: "How are you? " "Still like that." What to do?" Try to pacify. Be peaceful. Be peaceful. Be peaceful. Tell yourself: " Be peaceful. Be careful. Be peaceful."

And just imagine, before I started my lecture, nobody was coughing and suddenly, as soon as you sat down, one after there was a competition. Look at the bhoots how they are acting through you! Even if the rakshasas want, they cannot cough before Me, [NO DOUBT or KNOW THAT]. Only because you are My children you can have a [UNCLEAR] to do such a bad thing. All right? Now don't try to disturb. It's alright!
So, before tomorrow's Puja we have to [UNCLEAR] for a bath properly, whatever it is. I'm going to have the Puja starting at ten o'clock, not early. But you need not go in the out or anything, have your bath and all that and then I'm going to come down to you. [UNCLEAR] Keep yourself aloof with others. Don't get entangled with anybody else. Keep quiet. Don't talk.

Have the maximum now for this Puja at least. It is going to be Saraswati Puja for the first time. Actually I wanted to do Ekadesha, but to do Ekadesha is not an easy thing. And I thought, let it be! Not tomorrow. But one day we'll have to do that, also. We'll have to prepare. Don't talk, keep quiet. Keep quiet. And then sit down here for meditation. All of you come quietly. Actually you don't have to do anything, you don't have to organize, or nothing, you don't have to ...Now those Indians who are organizing are in meditative mood. Surprised? Those who are organizing, who are running about, managing this, managing that ...It's not easy thing, you know, to manage for so many people's food, morning, evening, every time. They are in meditative mood. So keep yourself in meditative mood. Try! Tell yourself: "Be peaceful. Be peaceful. My mind be peaceful!" Be still. Be still. Tell your mind to be still. Alright? And you'll be amazed, it's all within yourself. Try to merge your stillness within you. If you don't allow it, you'll get supraconscious which is very dangerous.

Better now. Let's keep to your source of peace. Sit down, sit down for one minute. That's the trouble. Let her sit down, Linda! Can't you make her sit for a while? Sit down straight. Make your children understand... They will never sit! [UNCLEAR] Sit still, within yourself. Sit down still within yourself. Just sit still. It's all inside you. You don't have to go anywhere, create anything, it's all within. Nothing is to be created. It's all within you. Better. Sit still! "Be still, my mind!" This stillness business establish, what I want you to establish within you. That's an escape. All perversions are escapes.

I'm quite happy with your progress, I must say. This time, it was a very good collective date. It was good. Everybody is coming up very well. Everybody, I must say, has progressed well; everyone of you has improved a lot. But try to know where is the problem. Everybody has individual problems. At a point you stop it. Just stop it. You can. It's all bhoots, you know, perversions come through bhoots. I mean, there is nothing to be explained any more. Anything, any diversion, any... I should say, bending away from Sahaja Yoga or from the center. Be in the center! And don't pay attention to this, pay attention to yourself. Everyone of you is great. Nobody is greater or less greater. So just don't worry about anybody. Don't talk too much about Sahaja Yoga. In India you be peaceful. There's a lot of time for you to discuss it in your own countries. Just here be quiet. Take it. Take it.

There is a bird in India, it's called as [tzaqua] and [tzakwili]. And they are the ones who just live on the rays of the moon. And they go on sucking the rays [SLOWLY???]. They don't need anything. That's all... Still [YOUR MIND]! Still your mind! Whatever mantra we say, if it is mechanical it will have no effect. We say: "Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu shanti rupena samsthita."

Still it. But you must do it with complete understanding, full deliberation. We have come here to gain something tremendous depth. And some of you are at the end of your trip.

Better? What a central Heart! [THE] futuristic still thinking about [ME IS GOING ON or UNCLEAR]. Don't be futuristic at this moment. Be there! I know what your mind is working on. Don't be... Just don't think I am sitting before you. That's all. Don't think of time or anything. Just be still. Just be still... Still thinking! Keep your eyes open. Don't think. You watch me. As you are the foundations still your minds! Cement is working [DOWN or IT OUT], but still it should [BE].

Just by stilling you get over all your diseases. Just by stilling your mind. [I'VE SEEN or SEE] that. Better? [LISTEN or JUST SEE IN] your head. Better. [UNCLEAR].
Also, I think, another way to put your Mooladhara alright is to see how long you can remain without blinking. Better... Now just ask: "Mother take us deep into your stillness". Just ask. Don't close your eyes. Trice! You need not say loudly, just say it in your heart.

At Sahasrara. Still at Sahasrara. Can you imagine? This talking leads you to nowhere else but to your Sahasrara. It's knocking. [THERE IS HEAT AT or JUST FEEL] your Sahasrara. How clear it is? Can you feel it? It's like a stone! Just see yours. I mean it is your own Sahasrara. Don't worry about others, worry just about your own Sahasrara. See? It's like a stone. Can you follow?

So, surrender. Just in your heart, surrender. Surrender. Put me down, and your Sahasrara will open [OUT]. The great journey. Forget about everything else. Just do that. Better. Sahasrara better now? ...

You are my children, you are my sons and daughters. Alright? Better now see on your Sahasrara. "Mother, You are God." Like Ganesha! [Looking up]. "Make us like Shri Ganesha." [OPENING UP or LOOKING UP]... Something's happening? ....One see that.

Come up. Let it come up.

Also some of you unnecessarily worry about Me. Better worry about yourself, because that's another escape. So it's like Himalayas, one has to [be]. Raise your Kundalini, slowly, slowly, slowly... Higher, push it higher, very much higher. Do it properly! With full attention. Not in a small way. Push it back! [UNCLEAR]...Up there. Again. With all undisturbed attention. Here, knot three times. One, two, ... It should be done fully and properly. Not half way I've seen the way people give bandhan, the way people raise their Kundalini. It's not the way. Do it properly. You are saints; you [ARE or SHOW OTHERS] archbishops of saints. You are the foundations of all the saints that have to come.

.....prophets. Have we all the powers of these prophets? Ask this question. Then you'll develop that. "Are we really Realized Souls, Mother?" "Are we the epitome of human civilization?" "Are we the epitome of God's creation?" Alright? Good! Much better now. Also don't turn your heads too much or turn your eyes too much. Keep them still. Try to keep them still....

Now I would suggest that all of you should ask each other to give a proper aarti to your Mahaganesha. Alright? So your Ganesha will be awakened. All of you should give an aarti, every one of you should ask somebody else to do it. And you'll be amazed how nice you'll feel. [AND] that will relief. Relief [TO THE] Mahaganesha. That's the quality you have to achieve. It's not easy, you must know. [WHENEVER or WHEREVER] I touch the point I find a big huge mountain in the head. Gradually you must face it. Take it out. Clear it out. Slowly and steadily. Better now? Much better. This mountain has to be cleared out. Clear it out!

I think you better give bandhan to yourselves. I'm giving a bandhan to Myself so that everybody gets a bandhan. Alright? Done? Better? You must learn all these mechanisms. Alright? How many times you give bandhan to yourself in a daytime? At least five times, like five namas. [IT'S GOOD]. Seven times is the best way. See how much you are clearing up to yourself? We have to [DO or BE] ourselves a bandhan [AS WELL AS or INSTEAD] we can give it to other. Let's use it for ourselves sometimes, our powers. See how it's clearing out? Can you see that? All your sickness, all your illness. Better? Everyone, everyone. Just give bandhan. Phil, give bandhan to yourself. Now left Nabhi. How you are clearing out, just see that! You like to do it because you feel [IT'S] so clear. All this back side is opening. Alright? No try? First time? Hundred and eight times it's the best way, sometimes. Now, see? Leave it, see if you are feeling better, aren't you? I thought you have already tried this. Never? It's like telling you how to eat. That's the basic of Sahaja Yoga. Better? You are enjoying it. Look at that. You all [UNCLEAR WORD SOUNDS LIKE THANKED] we should never take out all our own problems like this? Heat from the left? Good. You may do it whenever you feel like. It's so enjoyable to go on to doing it. You like it.

It's so relieving, you know. Instead of clearing others, better clear yourself. All others are sucking it automatically. Just try. Go on doing it. Left Swadisthana. In the [UNCLEAR]. Somebody has left Swadisthana? Linda, aren't you doing it? Do it properly, with proper care. The whole head is improving. Can you believe it? That you never knew. This is protection from yourself to yourself. Good. Still your Swadisthana. Give it a bandhan to left Swadisthana. Right Vishuddhi. Right Vishuddhi. Right Vishuddhi. Left Swadisthana, right Vishuddhi.[UNCLEAR]. Most dangerous combination. Right Vishuddhi's burning. Burning right Vishuddhi. Better. Alright? Now, leave it to Me ...Everybody is enjoying now. Do it at every finger. It's good. Much better. Rub this finger. Right Vishuddhi. Talk too much. Right Vishuddhi. English don't talk much, I think. Good quality, good quality. As long as they don't suddenly blame themselves. It's a good quality. Try to listen. Aaaa, better? Now the right side has started flowing. Little tricks here and there. Good .....

Gregoire de Kalbermatten: "Mother, we'd like to drive Your chariot and we are all your horses."

You see, to drive My chariot I must have at least horses which do not cough. Otherwise I'll be getting all the [JUNKS]. Already I have had enough of it. You have to be [smart]. Very good. Much better. ..

Ekadesha also, [LEAVE IT or FEW MINUTES] rub it out. Ekadesha. Rub it hard. It's good. Better? Much better. So preparations for [TOMORROW'S or MORNING]. Always rub your hands [UNCLEAR]...Conditioning goes out, rub[BING] your left [HAND]. Now, now Devi prasanna bhave [UNCLEAR]. Alright? Alright? So this is you have done your own Puja. Tomorrow, your Mother's Puja.

May God bless you all.
