So, try to be people who are without any conditioning that brings out your better quality.
You have been to [?], now you have seen it. Tomorrow is the New year and a very big day tomorrow. So we have to make some promises to ourselves. That is [?] such a great saint lived who just wore one dress on his body. We went to see him, we went to see his vibrations. Now, how much are you going to have out of his life in yourself? That is the quality. And God knows where he lived, nobody knows how he lived. He used to sleep on stones and  had his bath in every place wherever he went, in a river or any place.
He never cooked his food. He used to beg once in the day time. Such a great saint used to go and beg, you see. If I ask you to go and beg you will feel that I'm insulting you. So he used to go and beg while the whole of [inaudible] his lotus feet.  But he used to beg. And he used to beg once. He would eat that much, whatever he got or whatever house - that he would eat or he would not eat at all. So that kind of a thing we have to have, this conditioning has to be reduced as much as possible.
I was happy the way you sang the song yesterday with great love for Me. And if your love for Me increases like this, you will be surprised, your conditioning will drop out. That's the only thing Shri Ganesha has. And that's how he has become like this. And in the same way, if that love is there, the love will teach you how to get out of conditioning which are giving you ideas of the comfort. And also you feel that "I like it, I love it." "I", what is that "I"? It's nothing but this conditioned mind.
You try to get over your conditioning it's very important. And the best way to get out of your conditioning is to make your body a little bit suffer, a little bit, I don' say you crucify yourself. That I don't want. All the comfort is there, everything is there for you, food they are organizing, everything is fine. But try to enjoy by de-conditioning yourself, that's very important.
That you have ego, it's no problem but apart from ego, there is the conditioning of the ego. Terrible conditioning you have had. Actually, it's so much that now you can see how these people, in a simple way they live, how simple they are. In such a simple manner they live. They have very few clothes, not like you people. They are taking their bath early in the morning just every day. I never even called them, nothing they did not even know. I don't know how they came early in the morning and they are waiting for Me to come down.
So you have to see their life, to see how they live without any conditioning and how simple they are.
The quality of being is poor in the West as you can see because we have loaded ourselves with this conditioning. If you can really lighten yourself, a little bit lighten yourself with this conditioning and self-apportioning things, you see, that "this is I, this is I, this is I." Then only it will drop out, you see. With the minimum of minimum, one can live but with the maximum of maximum, God's blessings there.
So that is how you have to try to change your conditioned minds. When you are travelling, I want you to do that, that you see yourself how it is working, how your mind is trying to tell you what discussions it is taking in, what suggestions it is giving you and what ideas it has put, all loaded. So throw them away! We have to be modern and the modern is to get all our conditioning out of our minds. All right? So it is how it is, one of the ways we do it is through [inaudible].
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]
Grégoire: Come, please, near Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Today is the- this is the centre. [Someone gives a mike to Shri Mataji.]
Mister Shankara Deshmo is the gentleman who has started this centre here and he is the one who was in [inaudible] and now he going through another project in here. And then he thought of building a house here and he had to start a centre for Sahaja Yoga. So give him a hand he's a very great man. [Applause]
Now, he has been a very honest person in this Delegation department you hardly find honest people and he was very respectable and everybody had great regard for him. And when he took to Sahaja Yoga so many accepted readily because they know he is a great person. So the quality of a person is so great and Sahaja Yoga is in such a great manifestation that without calling anybody, without any advertisement, without anything thing, they all came this morning. Just, I was sitting here and I had to have this program so that is how it should be. And this house we're using for our centre and this is his daughter as you know. [...]
[Shri Mataji introduces the whole family]
They got their Realization in Gauri, and now it started here because of him he's done a very great job. And we have come to do the holy ceremony of this house. This is called as Vastu Shanti it to quieten the Vastus, the Gods of the Mother Earth, you see, so that they look after the Mother Earth.
That's how we are here and that's how the puja is going to be.
So may God bless you. It's going to be a small, short puja. At first, Shri Ganesh's puja will be there. And then after that, we'll have our food and then we'll be going to Kolhapur.
All right?
May God bless you."

 [Shri Mataji takes the mike to ask people, in Marathi, to leave the place because they are not Yogis.]
Now they have got a panic. I told them that no Sahaja Yogi should sit there. I mean those who are not Sahaja Yogis. And the lady sat down she got into fits. So you should understand what your Mother is doing it's Her power. You get also your Mother's powers. Not easy. [Unsure]
That's why we don't allow the people to come to puja who are not Realized, who are not senior Sahaja Yogis. All right?
Translate. 

Now if you want to take my photograph. If they want to take the photograph of My feet, it's a very different colour, it's Shri Ganesha's.
[Grégoire translates in French and in Italian]

Let us pray for innocence, just pray for innocence so that we inculcate it. So that the whole conditioning goes off.
