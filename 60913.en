She's gone off to sleep. Mm. So it should be. We would like to offer. At your lotus feet. This dance and this music which is our. First attempt in Italy of integration between Indian and Western performing arts. So. Dania give me the spectacles, maybe I might, so the dance. Should represent the beginning.

Of the great work of Sriadi Shakti. And uh it is contemporary Western dance, which is quite free from the classical uh patterns of Western dance. And the music is an attempt of uh uh. Finding in the Western music the links with the Indian music and so we found that the uh. Correspondents of the Indian ragas are the so-called Gregorian moods. Gregorian moods, which were the scales used in the Middle Ages up to the of the beginning of the 17th century, did you see the Gregorian boots? No, moods. Boots with M like Milano and um like Bologna. Thank you, thank you. And for the rhythmical part, we have chosen some reeds which could actually somehow fit both in India and in the West and some of these reeds, uh, rhythmical patterns are from the East Europe like Bulgaria, all these sort of things.

So this is just the very first experiment. The music is being composed by Federico himself. Now you turned round and see her dance. Yeah Oh. Just turn down. Tell them these children also done that. Yes, it's like this if you sit down. And for the instruments we also try to integrate the things and we use an electric guitar. With the sitar bridge, which is a quite a new instrument and uh. No, no, it's on tape.

It will be on tape and uh for the keyboard we use a synthesiser electronic instruments and both uh western and eastern percussions. This is contemporary. Yes. It's contemporary just one month ago. In the present. You see there. That's a challenge of property. This is ballet dancing. I this is ballet. She does, she knows ballet.

I see that's all. Beautiful, very good, but see this dress looks looks so nice for a ballet dance. It looks so beautiful and graceful. The way they use horrible dresses for men and women is horrifying. Absolutely horrifying. If they use nice dresses, it would look so nice, you know, it will add to that show. It's looking so nice this dress. May God bless you. It's beautiful, yeah. What next?

It's I Such a fast number and one better than the other, you know, just get into the dent and it's like an ocean of notes pouring one after another. It's beautiful. Yeah All right, let's have it. They're very beautifully gilted, you see, the lilt of the music is uh shows the, again the heart, I say, which is so full of joy. And the exuberance, the expression of that is the music. Beautiful.

Always translate it first it's better. This is the next song. Spain is so lucky. And so the Spanish are of having you as our mother with such a great heart, with such a great heart, which gives shelter to everyone.

All the Spanish now come to offer their heart to mother and to our brothers who have always helped. To bring Spain up, which, which has really been hard. Well, thank you, thank you, mother, for giving so much so that we, your beloved children have finally reached here. Just I have that. My Oh. Yeah No. I. lucky as But I Too. The. My. Now they.

Uh, just see how much joy they have brought for all of us. And we are very thankful to them for bringing this joy all the way from Spain. I know it was hard in the beginning. But But I tell you I love you very much, the Spanish. Really, I love you. And to see you here. Makes me so hopeful. That someday the whole of Spanish will become such. In my face, there's some resemblance with Spanish people, I think. So many people have remarked that I look like a Spanish.

Must have been some forefathers living there. The way I'm attached to Spain, apart from that. Though It in the beginning. It looked rather difficult. I went again and again and I knew it would work out and again this time I'm coming. For a longer period, may God bless. It'd be in July, isn't it? That's in July. I think in July, August, July. No, no, July in September because it's very hot there and you, you told me that there will be holidays, so September will be the best, all right.

Yes. What happened? He's been crying. Right I Ouch, but you know that because. What is happening? Why is he crying? Yeah, I told him to be, I ask him now to do because he's always distracting the other children. Is it he's got a little aria, I think. All right. All right, all right.

All the children should behave beautifully. You look so nice and beautiful, isn't it? And you are sitting in the stage, on the stage. Everybody is watching you. Such beautiful things you are, aren't you all very nice, beautiful, and behaving very well. All right. So Shimai, now we will have some budgets from France. With the connection. via dra. The Bega.

I practise querigayena. Yeah basic video where I just saw. just Cale. Please pass on the word. just Man so many friends, just do that. So many friends. It's, it's a basically a very old Maratti song. Um, and, uh, I've heard Sri Mataji sometimes, uh, saying it and she liked it very much. And that's why we thought of seeing it in front of her. No Uh In my I couldn't be me.

she. So Yeah. was. It. the. I. Agoi. will I see. No Yeah. I need that guy. Because So so.

Oh. Ibiza. Come. are. Oh. Show. And. Oh. I. Uh.

So. Oh. Yeah. Fulani Fulani. And my. I so. I shall be a. Malani. you Go. No. Yeah.

that I So. Yeah And. Yeah Ah. If the French can sing Maratti songs, I should learn French. But French is very difficult, you know that I've tried many times, I can't say many words somehow. And it's surprising how you people are singing so beautifully, so correctly. The pronunciations of Marathi are very difficult, but I don't know how you people are singing so well. May God bless you. Now we'll be singing Polish. It's a prayer.

It's Lord Lord's Prayer in Polish. OK What language? OK You No no your teeth on the mic and nobody. But I can't do it. This. Uh Mhm Um Yeah I used to remember Polish people at this time. They are in difficulties. They have been always in difficulties. They have been facing all kinds of Aggression all the time. Nice to sing in Polish language and to think about them.

One day they should also come to Sir yoga. We have some very few Polish. In London, but very few of them. And we have one in French also I must say. I think it's. What is that? That's better if we have. I hope one time we will be able to sing in French. Hold on. I have, yes.

Uh Um we Oh. Um Yeah Mhm Right. Yes. I Thank you very much. No. Don It's Mudan. It's not, it's Murudan. This is a sophisticated one. This one is it's not do, this is. Ah It's a sophisticated one.

So Sma you now we have the Swiss yogis. We'll see some budgets. I don't know, maybe in Chinese or. Rush, I mean. Mhm. She's common to all I think. Yes As we see very often such yogiss look very much like each other. come in. I Not bad. The dog is gone up.

I You Yeah. I think um he's not really a Swiss. I don't know. It's not really a Swiss group because actually we are Swiss, Austrian, uh, Indian, uh uh Algerian, um, what else? Portuguese, French, uh, who is Portuguese? Who is Portuguese. Uh That's great. So in short, they are all surgeries. T That's Yeah. What's that Just The same thing.

You. So have God Integrated. So the first song, the first song is actually taken from the Debi Mahatma G. It's supposed to be on page. We're not really organised as we should be, but, uh, it's it's somehow about in page 8 because we don't have numbers on our, on our pages. Everybody who is having the blue booklets and the brown booklets. So the name of the song, we just took some verses from the Divi Mahatmam and the refrain which everybody can sing is actually um. Greg, can you translate? Because we have the French version on it. Uh, the, the refrain everybody can sing is sarva mangala mangalishibi sarvata sadique Sharan triambique gai Nirmalamanamotu. I The tune means uh it is you who.

Uh Distribute all blessings. And benedictions, all you who are auspicious and who protect the universe. Everything is realised through you. You are the white goddess with 3 eyes. How much do you, Narayani. know He the first. I was He Yeah This was too strong. These are all mantras. And the whole Chakra start moving and revolving fast with it. It was wonderful for you too.

I really congratulate all of you, especially the way he sang, was wonderful, tremendous it was. May God bless you all. You will try to be as strong as the Italian in imitating the Indian songs. I think I don't think uh. Italian the Italian. They are better than the real. I was better than the real.

56. Is this 10. This is the song. Is sung by the fisherwomen. Of Galva Village and composed by Mareshwar. It's absolutely the way they sing their songs when they are catching the fishes. Now this sir that you have written is Zaina zaina Zaina means I'll go. So how's your Mara, I'll go. On the path of surgery. Chaitanyarutaha ina haina.

Ajamaa dojo. I Mama. I I I I. I. I. Yeah. to my To To about. OK. I I I jump out. I got. I just. Time I To. That.

He. Now I'm. And I. And Uh I So. The. Can not I OK. I Maybe I got I The. I. So But I I. So.

I Oh I I. Sahajana Sahanaina Moksha Badashinaga. I. That. I. I got a I. Ma. To those The. Ma. To. Uh, this, as I told you, the song is written by Moorreshwar. He was the son of a humble fisherman. When he was a very, very young boy, he wrote this thing.

And now he's got a scholarship and all that. Now he's in the final year of his arts college where he'll get a degree in arts. So this is uh, and he has such Such capacity not only that he has written this song, which is very, very Fast and very touching to the heart, but he has written a complete what we call the Mahat just like we have Devi Mahathir like that he has written about me near Mala Mahat, a complete thing he has written which is read by every Maharashtra every day, every morning. It is about, I think 16 pages, small thing, and you have to open one by one, and that's what this little boy wrote long time back. Now the first one is the one I must tell you that as Magato zogava Magato zoga zoga means joke.jog means yoga. I ask for yoga. Where do I ask for yoga? Isahaja yoga cha darba in the court of Sayoga while Mata Nirmala is sitting at the satra. I'm asking this very simple style in Indian, which is say in Maharashtra, they have a thing called yoga, a style of singing yoga. Yoga means when you ask for yoga, and this is one of them in the villages, they have been singing this since long.

This yoga is one of them you must have heard in the uh thing that is one yoga, uh, thing that I will ask for yoga. I'll give up that. I'll give up that is in that. tape that you have got. This was written by Namadeva a long time back. So it has been sung often by women and it sung asking for this yoga and oh mother, give us this yoga and please when will that come to get this yoga has been going on for ages, so. It is not so creditable for those people because they have known about yoga, they have known about Kundalini. They have known what is this righteous life, what is the higher life, what is the spiritual life, but it is very, very creditable for you people that you have took to. You have taken to saga. Not only that, but you have taken to all the songs and music, which are very fast numbers, I should say, of very different language, very different style.

It is all because your hearts are open and that you are people who are righteous. You have been very righteous and virtuous people in your last life. Otherwise, how could you have accepted this sudden change, turnover, and enjoying that in such a way that we all are enjoying that beauty and that sweetness in all pure relationships with each other. It's so. Illuminating, so encouraging that such things can happen. I cannot believe sometimes myself that the jowa that was sung in the villages of Maharashtra are sung today by all of you here and understood what is a jog. May God bless My heart pours out with love, blessings, and whatever you want. It pours out with that. May God bless. Very well done, I must say.

It's a very fast number. Moreover, villagers can sing it because they have no complications. But for people living in the city in the west to sing this song is not easy. Mm Now, which other countries must endorse to some other countries like English? One more you want to sing? All right. Sure, yes, that's a good one. That everybody can sing. All of you should sing this song. It's very sweet and simple.

Yeah yeah. I But. I play my that's got the pi pi or the words. This time, one day in Ganpati Pule, we'll have music by the Western musicians. I Like a river of Titania flowing. Making all kinds of sounds bounding down. Creating beauty all over. It's so beautiful to see the whole world dancing like this. You must pray tonight. That many more And many, many more.

Should Come to search yoga. Especially in the West. And then they should have. The sharing in this joy. Yeah. We have to think of those who are not here, who are not. With us but are with us because they are urgies. There are many who are still lost. In the darkness and ignorance Let your rhythm of dancing reach their hearts. C. And they come on the shores of this beautiful river of joy.
