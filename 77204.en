They are peaceful, very collective and extremely moral by themselves, nobody had to tell them. Because they were self-realised, because they had the power of their selves. And this is what has to come one day to New York, which is very important, but as this is the financial capital of the world they say, money becomes more important and those who can charge money, many people have told Me that, that if you start charging money there will be many more people who will come. But you cannot, because how much can you pay for your Self-Realisation? So the  understanding will come and there is nothing to feel upset, because anything that is reality doesn’t start with the bank. You can create thousands of plastic flowers but to create one real flower it takes time and you have to have that patience, because Sahaja Yoga is a living process of your evolution. You have evolved into this human state, there is a little breakthrough that is to be achieved.

When I came here, this was the first country I visited and that time I was amazed how people were seeking ardently, but how they were mislaid by advertising, by false promises and also by using all kinds of devious methods. There was no honesty about it, there is no simplicity about it. And they worked. At that time when I was talking, I remember, I was in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The gentleman who had organised My programme told Me that, Mother, you better take a sort of a copyright. I said ‘for what?’  They said ‘for your lectures, because they

will use your lectures and they will put up big organisations’. I said let them, it’s a very good idea, it will go to people, and they should know there is a new age coming, they should also know there is the Aquarius age, they should know all about it, there is no harm. I am not interested that I should do it, anybody else can do it, would be a good idea, because what I am interested in that people should get their knowledge, they should get their Self-Realisation. And that’s how so many ideas have cropped up. And what I feel, that there is a kind of a guru-shopping going on, and people are lost, also they have lost faith. It is unfortunate, very unfortunate, because the people who deserve, who need Sahaja Yoga, live in New York, not in India. In India people are not so tensed up, they are not so upset although they are poor but the riches also gives you lots of problems. But when they say that the people are affluent they go up to a point where they start just feeling what is beyond, there must be something beyond this. This is not the end of it and that is what we say, that after the principle of Lakshmi, that is the wealth, is fulfilling, then the Mahalakshmi is when the higher seeking starts. Seeking after money, seeking after power when it shows its results, when it has an effect on the personality of a person, when they see that the society suffers, every individual suffers, the ecology problems, then they start thinking, where did we go wrong? I met many intellectuals, also, who study religion, study all kinds of yogas, but no, but nothing inside, they said we have no power within ourselves that we could really control ourselves, they are taking drugs, they are alcoholics, I mean if you look at them, you would not even think that they have read any book. The reason is, the knowledge that we talk about is not a mental activity, it is not an emotional activity, it is a state of your awareness. Luckily Jung has talked about it, that it is a state of collective consciousness that is on your central nervous system. I think he has clearly mentioned about it, but as he could not give Realisation to people he could not prove it. Though people study him very hard, accept him as a philosopher. This is no question of philosophy, no question of freedom, it is something within you, the power. It lies in the triangular bone and it has to be awakened. It is like a primula in a seed which is to be sprouted and for that you cannot put in any effort, it has to be effortless, that is Sahaja. ‘Saha’ means ‘with’ and ‘ja’ means ‘born’, is born with you, this right to get this union with the Divine. Now if I say there is a divine power, the subtle divine power of love of God, which is all-pervading, people don’t like it, because even to take the name of God, people don’t like.  Because they just think of fundamentalists. But if I say so, you have to treat it as a hypothesis and you have to have an open mind of a scientist, to see for yourself. If it is so, let us feel it, why not. If you have that kind of an attitude, then it works. Even if you are an atheist, it works. Even if you are a certified bad person. It may not work in some but in many it works. And that is the last breakthrough. Just like I would say, make it very simple, this instrument is here unless and until it is connected to the mains, it has no meaning. In the same way you have to be connected to the mains. And once you are connected to the mains, we know the absolute truth, that’s a fact, not because I am saying so, but you will find it, that’s a fact. As a result of that, so many things happen.

As you have seen, there are six centres through which this power, this vital power, which is in the triangular bone, passes through, nourishes all these centres. These subtle centres are related to our plexuses. To our plexuses, as well as to our emotional side. As soon as these centres are nourished, we have seen, is a fact again that very many incurable diseases are cured, no doubt about it. And cured without any medicine, the medicine is within. But that is nothing, that is very simple. Mentally, many people have been cured. Also your intelligence becomes balanced, sharper, deeper and you become a dynamic person. But you are not aggressive. You are not aggressive but you are compassionate, you are loving, you are beautiful and you are magnetic. Even a glance of such a person can do wonders. The presence of such a person can do wonders. Now supposing a person who is a violent person, a person who has been a criminal, who has been suffering from all kinds of diseases, and also he has been indulging into all kinds of nonsensical things which are self-destructive. If such a person becomes a beautiful person, why shouldn’t we do that?

So, with this transformation individuals change, but it works en masse. Now for example, in India, we have 15,000 people in big cities, 12,000 people and they get their Realisation. The reason is, there has been lot of work done on this life, there have been lots of seers in that country, there have been lots of saints, real saints, in that country who have talked about it. Thousands of years back, they have predicted about it, people know about it, there is a background. Same about Greece, same about Egypt. They are ancient countries, in that span of time so many people came and talked about it and said about it.  Not that America did not have self-realised people, I would say Abraham Lincoln was a realised soul, but he could not talk about these things to people, they would not listen. There were many people who must have felt that this must be told, but the time was not then to talk about it, or to write about it. But still, it can work out. We need only one Abraham Lincoln to do such a marvellous job, we don’t need too many people. So we have to have such people around who will understand this great happening within ourselves.

Now the modern Sahaja Yoga, because Sahaja Yoga has been there since ancient times, the modern Sahaja Yoga is the one by which you can have en masse Realisation because the time has come, it’s a blossom time and in this blossom time you have to have your Realisation. Then one can talk about God. When I came here first, I didn’t talk about God, a word about Him. I told them about all these powers, and all that. And many organisations have come up. I know of an Indian gentleman who has a very big following here, who came to Sahaja Yoga and he said that ‘I have to start making money out of it’, and he has lots of disciples. They have a big ashram here, very surprising. But we should not deviate ourselves, because reality is the one that is going to work it out, not artificiality. There is something good about artificiality, that it shows up, it exposes itself and artificial people fight among themselves and it gets neutralised. It does no good to anyone, except for filling somebody’s pockets and spoiling so many people, it doesn’t do any good. So it is for us to understand, not to get disappointed.

I started Sahaja Yoga with one person. What is important is how deep we go into ourselves and acquire something that is our own which makes you an absolute personality. Tomorrow again, they are going to have My lecture, so I hope I will be able to tell you more about it.   But today, I think let’s spend some time in questions and answers, it would be a good idea. Let’s see what sort of questions you have.

Come this side, it’s better for Me. The one who has to listen to the questions can be on this side.

So, yes please?

Question [not clear]

Yogini: she wishes to apologise for all the New Yorkers who didn’t come.

Ha, you think New York belongs to you, New York belongs to Me also! Why you are apologising, it’s all right, doesn’t matter. May God bless you.

You see, what works in all these places is high technology of advertising, that’s what they are used to. Conditioning. But they’ll come round, don’t you worry.

Yes please?

Question [not clear]

Yes. You see, bhakti that we know of is the bhakti when we are not connected with God. When we are not connected with God, it’s something like we are telephoning without the connection. That’s why bhakti fails but the bhakti of a person starts as the Shradda when he is connected. The difference between the two types of bhakti you can see in our Indian literature very clearly. When I start talking, ‘when will I meet you, how will I meet you?’, in separation and there are people like Janaka, there are people like Kabira who talked with authority [speaks in Hindi or Marathi] I get around 25 people and put them onto one string of Kundalini. That authority,  like Christ.

That authority when they sing the praise of God, like Nanaka says ‘why are you running to the jungles?’ God is within you, seek within yourself. That authority, when you talk you can feel that these are the people who are connected. So the bhakti without the connection has no meaning, on the contrary, it is sometimes very dangerous. In my experiences of the people who have been baptised [unclear] it is amazing that I have seen these centres as we are talking about, have deities on them. Now if a person is following a particular deity, we say for example, Shiva is in the heart. A person who follows Shiva, or calls his name, gets a heart attack. You can make it out from the disease he has what deity he is after. I used to wonder why it should happen, but it is something very simple to understand that without any protocol, how can you take the name of God?  Supposing we have here, Mr Bush as your President. If I go to the White House and start shouting, Mr Bush, Mr Bush, I will be arrested. In the same way we have to have a sanction. Without any sanction if you just get after God all the time, and torture Him and say ‘God, God, God’, you get arrested and many people come to Me and say that ‘now we have been reading so much of Shri Krishna, we are taking his name and we have got a cancer of the throat’ because he remains on the Vishuddhi, you get into trouble. If you find a Christian who is a fundamentalist he will have his Agyna very badly caught up, horrible. Because you are not authorised, whatever is a fact, I am telling you. So you have to have connection with God. If I belong to India, I can ask Indian Government for My rights. I can’t ask United States Government for My rights, unless and until you are in the Kingdom of God, how can you ask for your rights? You have to enter into it. So just now as human beings, it’s the grace of God that can work on us but we cannot demand, unless and until we are connected. And I have seen it, out and out. In Maharashtra people are very devoted to Dattatreya, Adi Guru, you see, and that principle lies in our Void, you see here.  Invariably they all suffer from stomach trouble. So the pestering God like that without authority is very dangerous. You see, even to approach a Prime Minister you have to go through so many channels and to have an authority, then God is what, he is not in our pockets, that we just take him out ‘Oh God, now come along tomorrow give me a job, day after tomorrow, do this.’  It is only possible if you are in his kingdom, then you can say that. You don’t have to say, he just looks after it. It’s a fact. But nobody is going to believe it unless you have the experience. Now there are many here who have experienced that. So the bhakti has to be enlightened Shradda, in the same way, the technique. There was one Self-Realisation organisation here in America which was the same style as the bhakti style. When I first came, I was amazed that their tongues were cut and the tongues were hanging, just like a dog’s, you see has a tongue hanging down. They couldn’t talk, these people. I was told that this was done just to put the tongue back for a thing called Kechari, that is [unclear] and it was called as Kriya Yoga, so you have to do the Kriya, you have to take the tongue and put it back. Now, this is artificial. When the Kundalini rises, you see like a car you start, automatically all machinery starts working. When the Kundalini rises, automatically the Kechari takes place here, you don’t even feel it but it works that way.    [unclear] take place, everything takes place, we don’t know anything. When you eat your food, digestion starts, you don’t feel your food digested. So it is automatic, it is spontaneous, it is living, but this kind of a Self-Realisation, is like move the wheel, or move the tyre of the car and it moves, something of that kind. It is very artificial. We have not been able to see through that, through so much of artificiality in the name of God is carried on. And then they say that ‘there is no God’. If you do something artificial about it, you are not turning into the reality. We have many people who are supposed to be in bhakti. They do all kinds of things, they are smugglers, they are black marketeers, they are killers, they are murderers. You may follow any religion, you may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, any religion, Buddhist, anything. You can murder anyone, I mean there is no harm. Nobody thinks that it is important, because you are a Christian, you cannot murder. So there is no binding, there is no power that controls. But once you are a realised soul you just don’t do wrong, just don’t do it, because all this is artificial. But to accept it, you find it difficult because it’s a conditioning in our mind, that you see, if you do bhakti, it is all right. All right? You have to have bhakti, but it is more an entertainment. Real bhakti is only possible when you become one with the Divine.

Question [unclear]

Yes of course. Truth is what?

Question [unclear]

Who says that?  Who says that? No, no, nothing obvious. Yes, of course, there is no need to do. I am one of them. I am one of them. I have not read any books, I have had no guru, nothing, I am born like that. I am born like this, with knowledge.

Speaker [unclear]

Awakening is always described, in all the books. In all our scriptures, awakening is described. Even in Koran it is described. Everywhere it is described. There has to be an awakening. There has to be an enlightenment. You see, we would say that at the time of Shri Krishna, he didn’t talk of Kundalini awakening because that was not the time. But in the 12th century we had Gnaneshwara who was a great, one of the greatest poets you could think of on spirituality, who died at the age of 23 and wrote his Gnaneshwari, they say, at the age they say so, of 14 years of age. The whole of Gita he has written, in the sixth chapter he has described very nicely how you get your Self-Realisation through Kundalini awakening. Very clearly. Now, let us take this [unclear?] that whatever is written, whatever is there. Today Krishna is not here, today Gnaneshwara is not here. Let us see if this is the truth or not. Why to depend on something, the explanation of which we cannot ask? Why not today as it is, I am sitting here, to get your Self-Realisation, than to depend on something which you cannot explain, you cannot grasp. It is always so. As you know well, Shri Rama came in India, they said, ‘we believe in [unclear]. When Shri Krishna came, they said we believe in Rama because they are all dead, so it is better to believe in something that is dead, you can believe into whatever you like, but why not believe when somebody is living? There is no question of believing also, just to get it is your own, if this diamond is your own, why not get it? Why to depend on something, because somebody has said something, somewhere. Why not we achieve it? Supposing I say, ‘this diamond is available here, free’ not from New York, even from Australia people will fly out. We should have the same attitude towards spirituality. Then only it works. Otherwise there are many who are depending on such a thing and have died, depending on such a thing. Any other question?

Question

What is enlightenment is that within us resides the spirit which is the reflection of God Almighty. And when this light which is within us, which is a witness, becomes enlightened in our attention, then it is enlightenment, put it short. But to explain it fully, I need one big lecture. In the enlightened state, a person becomes endowed with inner peace, inner joy and the attention becomes active; it acts, acts for the benevolence of others, and for the benevolence of the person. So the blessing of an enlightened personality is both ways, it gives benevolence to the person as well as benevolence to others, this is the minimum of minimum. But in enlightenment you know what is wrong with you, what is your problem, and also you know what is the problem of others. If you know how to correct these you can give enlightenment to others. So, in the second stage of your enlightenment, you get the power to give enlightenment to others. Unless and until this happens, whatever people may say, I am this and I am that, you are not to believe. Even an ordinary policeman has authority and he has certain powers. So those who talk that I am this, I am that, if they don’t have power to give enlightenment to others, then it is better not to listen to them.

Question

Of course, of course, they can give enlightenment. No doubt, yes. That’s what you have to know.  When you get enlightened, you can give also, it is very simple, just to put your hands behind their back and you can feel. Yes, even putting hands like this, you can get your enlightenment. Just now.

Question: can we do it now?

Yes of course! That’s good, that’s good. Please come and sit here, please be seated. I will give you just now. I am going to give everyone, all right?  Just now, I am going to give to everyone. You better be seated, I will give you also. All right, please be seated. Make yourself comfortable. Very good. This is a seeker. All right, that is very good. Shall we have enlightenment? All right, let’s start. We can try. You have to take out your shoes, just to help Me, put both the feet on the ground. At the very outset, we have to know that you have not to feel guilty. We have not to blame ourselves for anything. Now we have not to think of our past, past is past, just now in the present. You have to forgive yourself completely, that is very important, extremely important, and you have to sit with an attitude of a mind that is pleasantly placed towards yourself. Forget about your past, forget about your problems, just now. I am sure it will work out. If it doesn’t work out today, it will work out tomorrow. It works out. All those who have been in Sahaja Yoga, it has worked out with all of them. And they know all about it.

Just you have to put both the feet on the Mother Earth, because She helps us a lot and both the hands towards Me. Before you close your eyes I will tell you how we have to help our centres. Of course it is not necessary to do all that, it works spontaneously, but it is better I tell you because when you are connected also, connections can be loose, so you should know later on how to raise your Kundalini again, to establish the connection, so today I wish I will be able to, I think I will be able to tell you what centres there are which we really have to nourish and help. So we say that the left hand represents the power of our desire to have Realisation, so when you put symbolically your left hand towards Me, it means you want to have your Self-Realisation, your enlightenment. Please don’t feel guilty. Please don’t feel guilty. Nothing matters, nothing is important, it works. Put your left hand towards Me and use your right hand for nourishing your different centres. So first you have to put it on your heart, your right hand, put your left hand straight like that. Sit very comfortably, there is no need to be in any way uncomfortable. Now, this is the centre of our heart where resides the Spirit, first. Second, we touch, we work only on the left hand side. The upper part of our abdomen, on the left hand side. And here is the centre of your mastery, mastery of the knowledge of the Divine. Then you have to put your hand in the lower part of your abdomen. On the left hand side is the centre which works out this knowledge in your being. Again we go back to the centre of our mastery on the left-hand side of your abdomen, then we put our hand on our heart. Then we put our hand in the corner of our neck and in the shoulder like this on the front side and turn our head towards the right.  This is the centre where we catch when we feel guilty. Is a very dangerous centre, and causes diseases like angina, like spondylitis, all sorts of diseases which they call as incurable. So you put the right hand, your head towards the right, and right hand on the corner of your shoulder and your neck. Now second thing you have to do is to again put your right hand on top of your forehead and bend your head, pressing on both the sides. Bend your head. This is the centre of forgiving others. You may say that it is difficult but whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything, it’s a myth. But if you forgive, then you don’t play into wrong hands. Now you take your right hand on the back side of your head and raise your head, put it backwards, see upwards like this, close your eyes when I tell you. Now this is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine, but you don’t have to count your mistakes. Now, then you have to stretch your hand, because in the centre of this is representative of this soft bone we had as a child, called as fontanel bone area. Please put this hand on top of your head and press it hard, push back your fingers, put left hand towards Me, put down your head, press it and move it seven times your scalp, very slowly clockwise. Now this is the centre through which the Kundalini comes out and gives you your connection to the Divine. You have to do it seven times. Now, now you have to do it after closing our eyes.

I hope you have followed it and I will be every time guiding you. Now, please put your left hand towards Me, both the feet apart, and the right hand on your heart.  Now, first of all, don’t feel guilty. You should be really pleasantly placed towards yourself. Don’t feel guilty. Close your eyes, you can even take out your spectacles because you don’t have to open your eyes till I tell you.  Now put your right hand on your heart. Here you have to say, you have to ask a question to Me, you can call Me ‘Mother’, you can call Me ‘Shri Mataji’, whatever suits you. A question very important, ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’ Ask this question three times in your heart. ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’ If you are the spirit, then you also become your own guide, your own guru, your own master. So now please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side, and say, or ask another question, ‘Mother, am I my own master?’ Ask this question three times. Now, take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side, press it hard, this is the centre of pure knowledge, knowledge that you feel on your central nervous system. So here I cannot force on you this pure knowledge, in your own freedom you have to ask for it. If you have to have the full freedom, your freedom is to be respected, so please here say six times, because this petal has got six, this centre has got six petals, ‘Mother, may I have the pure knowledge, Mother please give me the pure knowledge.  Say that six times. Now, raise your hand again on the left-hand side of your abdomen, and press it hard. As you asked for pure knowledge, the Kundalini has started moving and you have to help the other centres to open out. So to open out this centre with full confidence, you have to say ten times, ‘Mother, I am my own master’.  Please say it ten times. Now the greatest truth about you is that you are the Spirit.  You are not the body, you are not the mind, you are not the ego or conditioning. You are the Spirit. So place your right hand on your heart and here with full confidence you say, ‘Mother, I am the Spirit’. Say it ten times. Say it twelve times please. As I have told you before, you are not to feel guilty because love is the ocean of love and bliss. It is the ocean of truth and joy. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and you cannot do anything that this ocean cannot dissolve, so please don’t feel guilty. With full confidence now, put your right hand in the corner of your shoulder and your neck and turn your head to your right. Here, again with full confidence, you have to say sixteen times, ‘Mother, I am not guilty’. Please say it sixteen times. Now, put your hand across your forehead and press it on both the sides and put down your head. Here is the centre when you have to forgive everyone. I have already told you that it is a myth that we forgive or we don’t forgive, we don’t do anything, but if we do not forgive, then we play into wrong hands. So without thinking, without recording, remembering all the people whom you have to forgive, you just say, in a full way, ‘Mother, I forgive everyone’.  From your heart, not how many times is the point, but from your heart, say ‘Mother, I forgive everyone. This is the centre that always catches in the West and I find it impossible when I see people who do not feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, then I have to ask them again and again to forgive and then it works. So just now, why not do it? So take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Allow your head to rest on your hand, and here you have to say, without counting any mistakes, without thinking of your past, just for your satisfaction, please say it from your heart, ‘Oh, Divine, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes. Now stretch your hand, stretch your hand fully and put the  centre of your palm on top of your head as we call fontanel bone area. Press it hard, push back your fingers, and move your scalp, put down your head and move it very, very slowly, seven times your scalp with a big pressure. Here again, I cannot take your freedom, so you have to ask for enlightenment for Self-Realisation. So, you have to say, seven times, ‘Mother, please give me Self-Realisation, please give me my Self-Realisation, seven times.

[Mother blows into the microphone]

Now, open your eyes and put both the hands towards Me. Now, put right hand towards Me, bend your head and see through your fontanel bone area if there is any cool breeze. You can feel it from here, your head coming up. Just see with your left hand, like this, not on your head but away from your head. Now, put your left hand towards Me and see for yourself again, bend your head, sometimes you get also hot hair coming, doesn’t matter, it will all go away. See it, concentratedly, you see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Again, once more, put your right hand towards Me, bend your head and see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now, push back both your hands, like this and ask a question, ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the Brahma Chaitanya? Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God’s love?’ Now, ask any one of these questions three times. All right, now put down your hands. Now, those who feel cool breeze in their hands or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. You didn’t feel? All right, you will feel it. Now, let’s put it down. Most of you have felt it. Now, those who haven’t felt, also can feel it, it is very simple. So, those who have not felt can come and see Me. I would like to see why they did not feel. All of you, those who are new people can also come and see Me. I would like to see you. Come along, come along, please come up, others also should come up, those who are new.  [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]  All right, good. Now, you did feel, didn’t you? Ah, your eyes are sparkling. Now, good, good.

[Speaks in Hindi] Are you an Indian?  I met you in India – Hindi International Centre. Ah! Then you have to work it out now, work it out. You have to work it out. All right, good, sit down. Good idea.

[Mother speaks to new people] You didn’t feel it? Now, let’s see now, can you come this side? Stretch your hands, let’s see. Who didn’t feel it? You have been to some gurus or some masters or something? You have been before? That’s it.

Just say, ‘Mother, I am my own master’, just say within yourself, ten times. Can you come, some of the Sahaja Yogis, just to see all these people? Now, are you feeling anything? How are you? Right to the left, this is your seeking, you see, wrong seeking. But it will work out. Now, she has got it?

Are you feeling anything? You feel the cool breeze.

You got it? Good! You got it too, I can see from the smiles. Now, who else? You didn’t feel, Madam? You didn’t feel? All right. Now, any Sahaja Yogis, can you come this side, now, you didn’t feel, Madam? Your eyes are sparkling, I can see. Now, we will look after it.

[Hindi] Vishuddi?

Now don’t feel guilty for anything, anything. All right, forgive yourself, forgive, forgive, forgive. Ah. All right, come along. [Speaks to yogi] You can give Realisation? All right, come along, look at this lady. You got it? It’s good. And just go on saying, ‘I am my own master’. This is the worst thing that can happen. Left Swadishthan, Agnya? Are you now feeling? [Speaks in Hindi] All right. Who else now? This lady? Feeling now? Left side – put right to the left. She will be all right. Now this gentleman, did you feel? Good. You felt it? Little bit. All right, just raise it. Now, one thing one has to know. You have to respect your Self-Realisation, firstly, you should not be just coming here, now, finished, no. This connection has to be established for you.

Now we are having courses for this, where people are going to look after you. They are going to tell you how to fix your attention so that your Realisation is completely established. Nirvichara, you are in the thoughtless awareness, but you have to rise to another state of Nirvikalpa. Can you see her? Hello, you come up and just see her, no, this lady, just have a look. Just see, [speaks to yogi] you come up, you come up from the back side, or this side, you can come. She can look after, can you come up? Come from the back side. Ah, now, better? Such a seeker. It’s very hot. Have patience with yourself. Only thing you have to have patience with yourself, that’s all.

[New person] You can feel the breeze.

Yes, that’s the symptom of it, that you are enlightened, when you feel the breeze in your hands and out of your head. That’s the sign that now you are feeling the all-pervading power. Very hot, yes, I know. I am feeling the same, I am perspiring with it. That’s heat, too much heat. What to do?

[New person – what is it – hell?]

No, it’s because, my child, you have been to wrong people you see, they do harm very badly, I know. To whom have you been?  Ah, somebody you have been to, no doubt, you have been following some method. Many? Not one. I know, you are a seeker, out and out. It’s hard, I know, but you must ask, ‘Mother, am I my own master, just ask a question’. Openly, ask ‘Mother, am I my own master?   Just ask a question.....You ask because like a computer the answer comes. Here. Centre of mastery.

[New person speaks]

You just ask ‘Mother, am I my own master?’ What knowledge do you have?  You ask because it is a computer the answer comes. You see, if you ask a question it’s like a mantra, it works.  [Discussion with new person] You don’t know, sorry. You are your own master but that has to work out.  You have to say it, ‘Mother, I am my own master’. That’s what. Don’t doubt. You see, doubt is not there but there is so much heat, you don’t know. I am perspiring with you. Yes, you are very difficult! You must ask, you see if you want to have it.

Again. Again. Again. Shaking.

[Yogis talking]

It’s French? Brazil, terrible! This the case of Brazil no doubt! I did promise, but I did not know it was so.... You see, I am going to Brazil also, I am getting quite worried! There is a lot of black magic in Brazil also, isn’t it?

[Yogis talking]

So now, will you try on him, who is going to try?  All right, we will look after you. They have got to work on you first. They have gone through the same style. You see, nothing wrong with him, but the problem lies with these horrible gurus, you see. They are too much.

[Shri Mataji talks to Indian yogis]

Have you got it, felt it? All right. What about her? You felt the cool breeze? All right, put your hands like this, you say, ‘Mother, please come in my head’. I am at your disposal. Ha!

[Shri Mataji talks in Hindi]

What about her, she is all right? What is she catching? She’s got it, all right. So you have to forgive. That’s the point. Come here, I will tell you. Mmm. Come this side. That’s why. All right, doesn’t matter, forget it. Now, you just close your eyes, take her name, say that, don’t you worry and you take your birth, take your Realisation, forget about it. That’s why. You have to say that, all right. Did you say, three times? Left Swadishthan. She’s all right?

Now better. Did you say that? Now you have to give freedom to that soul, you see, don’t allow it to hang round you by thinking about it. Can you do that?

Give me your names and your addresses. Now better? Good. You are all right. Are you all right? You have to go further, to go further with it. All right? All right.

Please be seated, please, make yourself comfortable. Now what about you? Vishuddi.

[Shri Mataji talks to new person]  What work do you do? All right, put your hands here. Talk a lot, talk a lot, you have to talk a lot in that counselling. Forgive, just forgive, just forgive, forgive everyone. Vishuddi is very bad. Do you smoke?  Better, are you feeling? It’s there, quite a lot, it’s coming from here. Terrible heat. But if you forgive, it will cool down. We create our own heaters! Still the heat is there, all right. Cooler now, see, that’s the proof!  It’s cooler, isn’t it? It’s there. But you have to get into it. And you have to work it out, it’s a permanent thing and you have to understand what it is. You see, you got it. You got it, but still there is a little heat.  You yourself can feel it, I don’t have to say. The proof is there. You can’t forgive yourself? But I have forgiven you, so you had better forgive yourself. Just look at this, what you have done to yourself. What a big block you have. On this block you have not forgiven yourself, now forgive. Will you please forgive yourself. Left Vishuddi? It worked. Just say, ‘Mother, I am the Spirit’.

Now, better now? Just go on saying that. She has got it now. Now tell her to come and, what’s your name? All right You have to come, all right, and you have to know all about it, it should not be wasted. Give her the packet, and ask her. Gregoire has it, he is very angry with people. He is very angry with people. Now, better, much better now. Now, sit down. All right, let’s see. She is much better, but still, let’s see. All right.

[Shri Mataji speaks with Indian yogis]

Much better now. Now, you are going to come down. Read this course, meet these people, you have to be like them. May God bless you.

You feel it, it is hot. [Speaking to a person from Colombia] Colombians, they get it very fast. You felt the cool breeze? Come up, come from the other side. You must forgive.  Yes, you have got it. Let’s see, put your hands. Now, better? How are you feeling? You have to forgive, all right? Now, sit down and say ‘I forgive, I forgive, I forgive everyone’, come along, so that you are settled down. Now, say that, from your heart. It’s all right. Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hands? Come forward, did you really forgive? Come here, you spend so much time, forgive, forgive, forgive, why did you forgive, why? Now forgive, such a big block, what a big lump, just because you didn’t forgive. Just forgive, just forgive. Forgive, forgive, forgive. Now, how is she, feeling anything? Got it now? See? It’s there. Yes, it’s there, it’s true. Let’s start again. Say from your heart. I forgive everyone, say it from your heart. Forgive, just forgive, forgive. Now better? So simple, just to say I forgive everyone. You are all right, you did feel, did you forgive? All right, come here, I will have to make you forgive! All right. Now did you feel?  What did you feel there? Turn round, turn round. Hold your breath. Leave it. Again hold your breath. Again hold your breath. Leave it. Now, better? Now see, what do you feel?
