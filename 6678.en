Public Program, “Swadhishthan, Thinking, Illness”. Hilton hotel, Sydney (Australia), 17 March 1990.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. I'm happy you all are enjoying this music and this dancing, and about these artists I have to say that after coming to Sahaja Yoga, at a very young age they achieved such mastery. Because, when the Kundalini rises, as I told you, She enriches your centres.

The centre about which I was going to talk to you today is the centre of creativity which looks after your power of action, physical and mental. This power of action moves on the right side of the spinal cord and coming to the optic chiasma, it crosses over, passes to the left side and creates an institution called ego.

The institution of ego is a myth. What we do is to get something dead, like some trees dead so make some platform or some furniture. We take some stones and make a hall, and we think we have done a great job. Actually what we have done is to reconstructed the dead, but while doing it we get the feeling that we have done it, something. That is how our ego develops.

This channel on the right hand side caters to your future. So those people who plan too much, think too much, exhaust the energy of this centre because this centre has the first responsibility to convert the fat cells in the stomach for the use of the brain, which is overused, to make them into grey cells. So when you start thinking too much, it has to work more for this very important function. When it starts working for one function, the other functions are neglected. And the other functions are: it has to cater, to nourish or to give energy to your liver, to your pancreas, to your spleen, to your kidneys and part of your intestine.

So once you start neglecting these organs, first your liver suffers. Means, the function of liver gets limited. The function basically of the liver, basically, is to absorb the heat of the body which is the poison and allow it to permeate into the bloodstream. But, the energy is so limited that it cannot function properly.

So this centre starts neglecting liver and liver then cannot get rid of all the heat of the body, so the heat starts flowing upward. When it starts flowing upward then there's a centre what you call as the right heart - which gets effected. People develop a disease called asthma with it. Also they develop a disease what you call as a massive heart attack, on the left hand side, when the heat reaches there. They also can develop a paralysis of the right side when it reaches the brain. The vulnerability is there. And then it's triggered somehow by the left side action, maybe. Such people are futuristic. They go on planning for the future. Future doesn't exist, only the present is the truth. But they go on planning about future, waste their energies and ultimately find that all their plans fail. One must know the Divine plan. If you know the Divine plan, then you don't have to plan because you know the Divine is already planning for you everything.

When you understand after Realisation that everything is done by Paramachaitanya, by this All Pervading Power, by this Ruh, then you do not think that you are doing something. Moreover, as I told you, when the Kundalini rises, through the Agnya Chakra, both these institutions of ego and superego are sucked in so there is no ego, so you become egoless, so your karmas or your duties or your so-called work you have done become akarmas.

Then you don't talk like this, that "I have done this, I have done that." They say, "Oh it's rising, it's happening, it's working out." You start speaking in the third person. Even sometimes children you will find they talk like that. "This little boy won't go because it is obstinate." They'll talk about themselves. If you notice if they're realised souls they'll talk like that - in the third person.

So you become a third person. And nourishment to this centre comes through your Realisation as the Kundalini is connected to the mains. As a result, you get into balance. You are in thoughtless awareness.

Somebody has asked Me about the thinking, yesterday. So the thought arises from the past or from the future. As we have a capacity to react, because of the construction of our body as a prism. It's a little scientific thing, but if you listen to some of My lectures, you'll understand what I mean. Now what happens, when you see something, you react - anything you see, you react. You see this carpet, you'll react. You'll see this mic, you'll react. You'll think something about it.

So, a thought comes either from the future or from the past and there's a wave of thought coming and going, again thought coming and going. It comes and disappears. In between these thoughts there's a little space which is the present. But if I say you pay attention to yourself - to your present - you cannot, unless and until you are a realised soul. So when the Kundalini rises, these thoughts become - they lean out, means they become thin. When they become thin, the space in between increases and that's how you become thoughtlessly aware. So the thinking is minimised, then the liver doesn't have to do all the time the job of converting your fat cells into grey cells. It comes into balance.

Then the second one is the pancreas. That is neglected, too. In a person who is futuristic, who thinks too much, plans too much, that also becomes neglected. Now, the function of the pancreas is to absorb the sugar into bloodstream in a proper way. But because it is neglected, it has a very limited energy, it cannot function so you get diabetes. Because of too much thinking, you get diabetes. As I told you yesterday that in India, if you have to give tea to someone, be careful if he is from a village, because in the village you have to put so much sugar that the spoon should stand at right angles. Otherwise, it's no tea for them. And they never get diabetes, never get diabetes.

Diabetes is the headache of the people who sit on chairs, write, think, worry and are time bound. All such people get diabetes. They're futuristic, egoistical, arrogant, hot-tempered. And such people get also heart attacks which are of a massive nature. The Left Heart is connected in a way. When there's too much of exertion on the physical side also one can get heart attack. The another type of heart attack one gets is angina, that's due to some other reason, that's due to the lethargic heart.

So now we have another problem which is very serious is that of the spleen. Spleen is the speedometer. It's the one that gives us rhythm. If we are rhythmic in life, spleen keeps all right. But we are very hectic. And the function of the spleen is to create red blood corpuscles whenever there is an emergency. So the way we are, we are always under a shock. Early in the morning you get up, what do you see? You read the newspaper, horrid news. I mean newspapers have to give horrid news, they never give good news, you know. They say, "We don't want to say if some plane has landed safely," but if there's a disaster, so many have died, killed in action, murders, horrible things, naturally you get a shock, because you are a human being and in a subconscious you feel, in unconscious area you get the jerk. There's a shock. Then you start the day in a hectic way, you are time-bound, you have to rush, you can't take your breakfast, you just take something, grab, rush to the car or maybe on anything and then you find the jam in modern days. Everything keeps you on a tension. Then you reach the office, there's the boss who's getting angry with you because you're late.

As it is I don't know how much work we really produce. Only the mess we have created in this world I think much more in the modern times than much work. We cannot have people like Mozart nowadays, we can't have anyone like Michelangelo, we cannot have any artists who can create beautiful things, we do not have beautiful buildings now - horrible, plastics. We cannot have beautiful, artistic clothes. Everything is becoming plastic and for which we are working so very hard to create plastic mountains.

All this leads to tensions, so we become tense. And the tensions go on increasing as this ego increases, covers all your head and you go into tension. But the worse thing that happens to you that this spleen which is the one responsible for keeping the rhythm of your life, goes hectic and becomes crazy, doesn't understand what sort of a personality you are. Sometimes you rush to that, sometimes you rush to that. There's no rhythm in the life.

So it gets upset and it starts producing red blood corpuscles unrhythmically, it doesn't know. So the vulnerability is there. And as soon as there's any triggering from the left side, you develop a horrible disease called blood cancer, and the only treatment you can have in the medical science is that you'll be certified that you'll die after eight days or after one month. That's the only possibility.

But, with Kundalini awakening your own power nourishes this centre and supplies energy, soothes down your hectic speedometer which is the spleen and the disease gets cured. There are many we know of who got their blood cancer cured and even after six, seven years they're living and kicking all right.

All this is available to you within yourself. This is all been promised. Many great people have written about it. It's not that I'm saying something new. Only the new thing we are seeing here is that you can get en masse Realisation.

Then is the kidney. Kidney also gets effected, firstly by the heat of the liver, secondly by the strenuous type of life you lead - futuristic, neglected - and then you get blood pressures. Blood pressures you get till you get failure of your kidneys or you might get a paralysis - anything is possible. So we have blood pressure, high blood pressure. All this is only because of one centre, when it is out of gear. But if all the seven centres are out of gear, what should happen to us? And I think the modern life is such that it could be, all centres could be in danger. So it is eminent, is important that we should get our Kundalini awakened and we should enjoy the best health.

Health of course you enjoy very well, no doubt. But apart from health you enjoy many other things. First of all you enjoy yourself. Today there's no time to discuss all the centres but still I would say that I would like to give you all the benefits of Sahaja Yoga, which are possible, that you start enjoying others. You become righteous, as I told you, and you start enjoying your virtues. You are no more a critic of things. If you have to criticise, you criticise yourself, laugh at yourself and you don't laugh at others. You start connecting yourself if you have the art of Kundalini awakening, because yoga means, of course, the union with the Divine. Also means yukti, meaning the deftness - deftness to raise the Kundalini of yours and of others.

If you know the decoding of these centres, of these centres on your finger tips - five, six and seven on the left side; and five, six and seven on the right side - if you just know the decoding, immediately you can do the diagnosis, what is wrong basically with you, and you can correct it. So physically, mentally, emotionally you can correct yourself; and spiritually you ascend. You ascend to a state of a saint, a sage. And the time has come for us to become sages. For that you don't have to leave your homes, houses, run away from your families, nothing. That's an escape. You don't have to suffer. You have to enter into the Kingdom of God to enjoy that beauty and bounty of His love.

Now this balance is important within us. There's one more disease, a very common one in the West is the cancer of the breast in the case of women, which comes from the centre of Heart. The centre, there are three hearts according to Sahaja Yoga - one is the Central Heart, one is left and one right. Now the Central Heart is placed in the spinal cord, below the sternum bone. Sternum bone is the one that creates the antibodies till the age of twelve years. And then they get distributed all over. And these antibodies then fight all the emergencies and overcome all the troubles for us, but then they can become also very weak. So, the remote control is in the sternum bone.

Now this centre is the centre of a Mother, of the Primordial Mother, we can say, of the Mother Who is the Mother of this Universe and Mother of this world Who looks after the security of children, security of the people. When a woman is challenged in her motherhood - supposing she is a wife of someone and husband is giving her insecurities by any means, supposing his is a wayward person or he's always threatening her or dominating her or challenging her - her security gets disturbed and then this trouble starts. Maybe her children, maybe anyone can give this insecurity to a woman and that's how she develops this cancer of the breast. That also can be corrected if the Kundalini could be made to pass through this centre and nourish it.

The centre that is the most important is the seventh centre. The seventh centre is the centre which is placed around the limbic area in the head which has got one thousand petals and when enlightened it looks like beautiful flames, very wide flames just like petals of all the seven colours. That's why it is said in the Bible, "I'll appear before you like flames." These are the flames, you see. This is the most important thing because around the limbic area are placed all the seats, governing seats of all the centres. So, if this centre is fully opened out, they all get drenched by the grace of the Divine Power and the person really, really enjoys Sahaja Yoga in the best possible way. He's a happy person, he's a joyous person, he emits joy, he emits peace, he's compassionate, he's tireless, he looks after people and such a person can achieve great heights of purity within himself.

The another centre which is bestowed by Christ, as I told yesterday, is the Agya Chakra, which is also very important because Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." That's what He has said it. You should find out among Christian nations how many have got such pure eyes. Pure eyes means those who do not react, just witness, watch. There's no greed, there's no lust in those eyes. Such eyes are so powerful that even a glance of such an eye can give salvation. And this is what it is: we have to achieve the pure eyes. Such pure eyes are the only one which give you the joy of seeing.

Of course you'll have the books, you can read them and find out about all the centres and know about it. But what we have to see is that the problems of the world are because of us. We are the problems, and we manifest the problems outside which reflect back upon us like the waves come back and dash against the shore and again are reflected back. We have to, ourselves, get into the state of sages. Then nobody has to tell you, "Do this" or "Do that." You become your own master, you become your own guru, and you look after yourself. I have to apologise for one thing - that Sahaja Yoga started in Australia with a little jerk. They were Australians who started it, but they were not up to the mark, I must say they were not - created lots of problem for us, lots of problems. And we didn't know what to do with them. It has happened nowhere in the world as it has happened here. I don't know why it took lot of time for it to properly establish itself.

Thank God now we have people who are sensible and I hope you will make it convenient after getting your Realisation to establish yourself properly, establish yourself and reach that state of Nirvikpalpa, doubtless awareness. If you have any problem, you should write to Me directly. You don't have to bear anything. Christ has already taken the cross upon Himself, so we don't have to do anything. If there's any problem that you find is not all right, you should write to Me instead of getting disappointed or getting frustrated. Is best is to write to Me. I know it's far away - Australia is very far off. But this is the land which is the land of purity. This is the land in the universe is the first centre that you see there, and Uluru that you have - Uluru means, as I told you, is the Chaitanya, is the symbol of that purity.

So you stand for the innocence of the world. You are such a great nation here that stands for the innocence, and you could be very gullible, so you have to be careful and understand your own identity as innocent people. And I am sure it will work out very well for all of you. And this country which has many problems will be solved by your own purity and the whole world can be helped with your own purity and beautiful lives.

May God bless you.

Yesterday we had too many questions. Too many. And I told you that by asking questions - I can answer all of them, I think so, but I cannot guarantee that if I answer you that means I can give you awakening. It's not guaranteed that way. So, if you want to have your Realisation and if there is any problem that stands between that Realisation and yourself, then it is better you should ask Me some question. It's much better to save time.

Question: Is raising the Kundalini dangerous?

Shri Mataji: Not at all. Kundalini is your mother. She's your individual mother and She looks after you. She knows everything about you. She's taped everything that you have been doing, you have been desiring. She knows everything about you and She's anxiously waiting to give you your second birth. As your mother took up upon herself all the labor pains, She takes all the troubles for Herself. We have had so many people. I have never seen anyone getting into trouble. This myth has been created by people who are money-oriented, I think, who wanted to frighten you so that you don't go to reality and pay them well.

Question: Could You define "Kundalini"?

Shri Mataji: Yesterday I did. You came today only? Oh, I see. Kundalini is a power, as I told you, is a residual power, is the fourth power within us which resides in the triangular bone in three and a half coils. And It rises through six centres, subtle centres. This is the power of your pure desire. All other desires are impure because they're never satiable in general. The only desire that is pure is to be one with the Divine.

(Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi)

Nanak Sahib has described as surti. Kabira especially has described it as surti. But imagine human beings how they are. Kabira was born in Bihar, most of his work was in Bihar. Later on he went to Punjab, and in Bihar they call tobacco as surti. Yes, in Bihar they do. It's very surprising to call tobacco as surti. So many things of Granth Sahib can only be understood when you get your Self Realisation otherwise you cannot.

(Shri Mataji recites lines from Kabira's Granth Sahib)

What is this apa? Is your Self. He is the one who has done the tremendous work on this. Tremendous work on Kundalini, all of them - Namadeva. Even to think of them is great.

Question: How is that you can control your ego and all that as well as the (inaudible).

Shri Mataji: Yah. This is the first temptation you have.

Yah, yah, yah. Agreed with you that it starts giving you ego if you are not fully developed in Sahaja Yoga. This is the first temptation, I know that. But people become very creative. It has happened to many Sahaja Yogis I have seen, they became very creative, they started producing lot of potteries and things, and started producing beautiful paintings. There was one Australian lady she produced very beautiful paintings and she got, won fame and all that, and ego had blasted her completely. And she came to see Me in Perth, I found such heat coming out of her, like a cancer patient, absolutely like a cancer patient. And then if you tell her, "You have got ego," they don't like it. Because they're so egoistical.

That's why you have to take the Kundalini always up there. You shouldn't be satisfied. You see, that's the slipping point sometimes, so be careful. Be careful. Now look at these artists, they are so simple. Our attention should be "what have I attained in Sahaja Yoga, is my spiritual ascent." This is just a temptation, one of the temptations that people have. That's not so important. Now for these artists, the most important thing is just to play for Me, that's all.

A yogi repeats the question asked by a man in the audience: You say we shouldn't plan too much. Could You explain that because obviously we need to plan a little.

Shri Mataji: (laughs) You see, if you are in Sahaja Yoga and in meditative mood. If you're in a meditative mood and if you're in Sahaja Yoga, then you just don't plan, because you know the planning is already done for you. I know that if you take the name of "airport", only "airport" you take the name and most of the men will start jumping. They'll go at least one hour earlier than reporting time. Aeroplane is not going to fly out, you see, but they fear that it will fly out. Now, if you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you are going for catching a plane, say example, you should know what time you have to leave and you leave at that time, you'll reach there in time. You don't have to see watch all the time, you'll just leave at that time, exactly at that time you'll leave. But also if you are a little late, the plane will be for you. But you don't want to be unkind and the Paramachaitanya looks after you. You'll just remember you have to go now, you leave that time. It is so simple. But to believe that Somebody Else is planning us is beyond our ego.

A yogi repeats the question asked by a man in the audience: He says if he has to leave the planning of his life to someone else, he's denying his own individuality - he's denying that fact that he creates his own life if he leaves the planning ....

Shri Mataji: That's a good one, in a way is good. Why do you want to have this kind of a feeling that you are creating the world? Nobody's creating. You can't even create even a grain of clay. No you can't. You can't create anything. What's he saying?

Yogi: He says he's creating his own experience now just by raising his right hand or his left hand.

Shri Mataji: You see you have to be little deeper to understand the significance. Also to have faith in yourself that supposing you become connected with the Divine Power. Now, I'll tell you what.

Supposing you see a television. All right? The television is connected to the mains there. All right. Now you want to see Shakespeare, for example, that's your plan. But there's another plan there going on, and when you open, it's not Shakespeare, it's something else. So what do you do? Do you loose your identity? (laughter and applause)

Now it's all right for him. All right, you follow My advice and you'll see what I am saying. All right? Now just give it a chance. Give it a chance. First of all get your Realisation and give it a chance. All right? Hah.

Question: What is the best way to go towards Self Realisation?

Shri Mataji: That's what we are going to do. All right? That's a very good question. You just wait. After all these questions are over, we'll have that.

Yogi: He says he understands why our own actions cause imbalances in ourselves but how about young children? How do these diseases get caused in young children?

Shri Mataji: Now for example, a mother is a very busy lady. When the child is there she's doing all kinds of work and thinking too much, running too much. Or the father is doing that, that has an effect on the child. You see, human beings are delicately made. I mean in ancient times, if a woman was to have a baby, she used to take it very easy and she used to read something spiritual, she used to be thinking about her child and feeling that motherhood within herself. But the mother doesn't think of the child. She just thinks she has to today go for hairdo or she has to do something - face lifting or something like that. I don't know much about these things, but that's what I've seen. It's too much of superficiality and this has killed the beauty even of romance, you'll be surprised. Absolutely, it's absurd. These hair dressers have ruined the beauty of women in the way because somebody likes one particular type of hair dress, he falls in love with the hair dress. Now she changes her hair dress, he wants to have a divorce with her. So superficial attachments to superficial things! There's no deeper attachments to innate, something so natural. Artificial things cannot lead us anywhere, they can never give us joy.

Yogi: Is wanting Realisation futuristic?

Shri Mataji: Good. Good. Now what is she wanting here, this lady?

That's what I'm going to do. I'm very happy. That part you just forget, the rest of it. Is there any other question? Now let's see.

Yogi: One in the back.

Woman: Will we see a time when most of the world will have their Realisation?

Shri Mataji: Hope so. Hope so. I would say that's My dream. I wish, I wish that happens.

I'm actually desireless. But your desires work. If you desire, is the other way round. It's not "Thy will be done," but it's "Thy will be done." If you desire, it will happen, it will happen.

Yogi: Is it wrong to want or desire a family and have unity in a family and to enjoy the normal pleasures of life?

Shri Mataji: I mean, we are marrying so many people. It's not at all. It's the best thing to have a family and children. But not to get involved so much into your family that you forget your ascent. How many times you are married in previous lives and how many children you have had in previous lives? Now this is the time for your ascent and your family should be complimentary. If it is not complimentary it's not going to help you. It is your choice, you're free will. If you want to get dissolved into your own children and your family only and not to have any ascent, nobody can force you. Go ahead with it. But this time is important. This is an important time. Of course you have to have family; of course you have to get married. You have to lead a very normal life. Nothing abnormal. But if somebody is too much attached to the family, forgets his own ascent, then I think he is missing the point. That is the most important thing in life.

Yes, please?

Yogi: Isn't the greatest danger in the future over population?

Shri Mataji: No, not at all. Actually there are no imbalances that's why there is a population growth in some countries and no population in some countries. Like on the BBC gentleman came and asked Me in London, he said, "Why do you have such a population growth?"

First he asked - I mean they are, you know after all, they can ask very funny questions. They have every right to do what they like. So first question he asked, "Why, why is it in India you have so much poverty?"

I said, "If you have a guest for three hundred years in your country, what will happen to you? You'll become a broke."

Then he said that "Such a population growth in Your country, what about that?"

I said, "If you can allow Me, very humbly I would state you are responsible for that also."

He said, "How are we responsible?"

I said, "In England, I used to hear that two children are killed every week in England by their parents."

He said, "No, only in London."

I said, "Really? That's the case? So, what child, which child would like to be born in this country?"

That's why you see in Germany it's minus, Sweden is minus, Norway is minus. All these countries are having minus growth and people are competing in committing suicide. Switzerland - there's a competition on. All these countries are supposed to be affluent countries where they have money, they can look after their children better, they are competing in having suicides and in having minus growth.

But in India, even if you have ten children or twelve children, love is all the time there available to them. And what a child needs is love, not all these pomp and show that you should have a nice cot or a nice this but a loving mother. That's why they come to India. Now if you create such mothers, they'll come to you also.

Question: How long should a man or a woman sleep?

Shri Mataji: You see, there's no hard and fast rule for that, actually. I think as you grow old you don't sleep so much, I personally think that way. I sleep very little, Myself. In the night about three hours; in the daytime about one hour or so. But depends on - it depends. So, for sleeping, there's no hard and fast rule, but whatever time you are born, that's the time you want to sleep. So, some people like to sleep in the morning, all right let them sleep. And some people want to sleep in the night, let them sleep. Makes no difference. But after coming to Sahaja Yoga, all these conditionings disappear. And then you start behaving in a different manner. There's a transformation. And then maximum time you want to give for your meditation, for knowing about Sahaja Yoga, and you get more time.

Actually, we should have much more time than our ancestors. You know, we don't have to go to the jungles to get our wood for our fire, we don't have to do all the rest of the things they used to do. Poor things, they had to go for hunting. Now we have everything in the house already made, I mean, instant. Isn't it? And we have the watch on all of the time watching the watch. But we have no time. We are the worst. They had more time than we have. So where are we spending the time? While coming here I just asked him, "What do they make?" Because I was seeking all Chinese things, Japanese things, and then I saw lots of Greek, and most of them were Italian things in the market, shops.

I said, "What do the Australians make?"

He said, "They make lager."

Where do we spend our time? In the ballroom dancing? Or in the lager? Or in some way destroying ourselves with drugs or something like that. We have no time. We have time for drugs. All right. Then parties, some formal things which have no meaning at all. It conveys nothing. I have been now in London in a position where I had to shake hands with six to seven hundred people. And only I remember the horrible things that happen to the hand, otherwise I don't remember even the faces of the people.

So there should be a better method of developing a rapport between us, understanding each other in much more natural way. And then we have time - this is the time to enjoy. But nobody enjoys because we are so time bound, we are so time bound, only time to enjoy we don't have, and that's how whatever you people say about sleeping or waking up and all that is that your regulation doesn't come from the Divine. If it is from the Divine, you just enjoy, you just enjoy your life, you enjoy yourself. Never feel ill or sick. And now I am sixty-seven, every day I'm giving lectures, morning, evening. And the smokes, the way people smoke, women - especially in Australia, I don't know what has gone wrong with them - I try to go with the women so that I'll be saved from smoking, they smoke more than the men even here.

So I've developed a throat trouble, I hope it will be all right. But this is what happens. Where do we spend our time? There then you are beyond time, into the timeless dimension enjoying yourself. That's the beauty we have to achieve; that state we have to reach. All right?

What is it?

Yogi: He says, "My revered father has been for the past three or four years experiencing astrals sounds, but physically his hearing is impaired or cut off for all practical purposes. Twenty-four hours a day he is able to tune into the chanting of sacred Hindu hymns, devotional music rendered by an enchanting voice that accompanied by a violin, etcetera. He has done no special tapas or meditation but he is very naïve and a simple soul. Is it because of the awakening of the Kundalini?

Shri Mataji: No, not at all. Not at all. All these things should not happen to you. You don't hear anything; you don't see anything. You become, you just become. This is a subject which has to be dealt with clearly about the dead souls and things, it's quite a big subject. But if you come to Sahaja Yoga you'll understand what happens, how you hear these things and how astral things happen. How your cot deaths take place, all these are all negative things and are achieved by people who deal in the science of the dead, which is very important that you should get out of all these ideas and become your Self. Only way to know if a person is Realised is not, the way he can handle the Kundalini, the way he can feel the vibrations, and the way he leads his own life.

When you go to any guru, first of all see the disciples, how they are, how they behave, what powers they have got. Then you accept. That's the sign of a satguru. Nanaka has said clearly. Guru Nanak was such an enlightened soul and he said that "The one who meets you meet God is the satguru." Everybody is not a guru.

So should we now have this Realisation?

(Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi)

That's for only Indians. Indians abroad. Now should we now finish that?

Can we take out our shoes because we have to take the help of the Mother Earth.

As I’ve told you, it cannot be forced. I respect your freedom, respect your freedom. It’s your free will. If you want to have your Realisation only you can have, otherwise, you cannot. It cannot be forced on you. So those who do not want should leave the hall to be civil to other people. Otherwise, you are welcome.

There are two conditions in Sahaja Yoga, at least when you are getting your Realisation. First is to forget your past, to forgive yourself. You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself, pleasantly placed towards yourself. And second one is that you have to forgive everyone. As I told you yesterday, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. Actually, if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. So just neglect it, completely. Don’t worry about it. And in general, you should say, “I forgive everyone.” Just say in general, “I forgive everyone.” That’s all. Not to count how many people you have to forgive, not to know about everyone, what they have said to you, but just forgive in general. That’s all.

So the first one is to forget your past. That means not to feel guilty at all. You’re not to feel guilty. After all, you are a human being and human beings can only commit mistakes. You’re not gods. So what does it matter? There’s nothing to bother you on that point. Should not. So please forgive yourself and forgive others. That’s very important. These are the two simple conditions. But mentally, you should accept them.

Now, we have to put both our feet little away from each other because you know there are two powers within us – left and right. And we use our left hand symbolically to suggest that we want our Self-realisation and this is the power of desire, not of pure desire, but desire. And we use our right hand which is the power of action to nourish our centres on the left-hand side. We’ll be nourishing our left-hand centres only.

So now you please put your left hand, comfortably the way you want to put it – it will hardly take ten minutes – and use your right hand, as I show you now. And then we have to close our eyes.

First, put it on your heart. This is the centre where resides the Spirit – so is a very important centre. Then you take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side which is the centre of your mastery created by great masters. Now take down your right hand again to the lower portion of your abdomen. It is the centre – I hope you can see him, just come forward a little bit, Steven, if you don’t mind, please, thank you. This is the centre of pure knowledge, pure knowledge that acts on your central nervous system.

Then you raise again your hand up on to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side, press it hard. Then, on to your heart. Then into the corner of your neck and your head. Press it as back as possible and turn your head to your right. This centre you catch when you feel guilty. Now you take your hand and put it on your forehead. Put down your head on it, press it hard.

This is the centre to forgive others. Take your right hand on the backside of your head and please raise your head towards the sky. This is the centre to ask for forgiveness from Divine without feeling guilty. Then stretch your palm. Put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Bend your head. Now, stretch your fingers outward, outward as much as you can, put a pressure on your scalp and move your scalp clockwise. Seven times very slowly.

Now, that’s all we have to do. Now you can close your eyes, put your left hand towards Me. Be careful, you keep your feet apart. Those who are sitting on the ground are all right. And now close your eyes. You can take out your spectacles if you want to because you don’t have to open the eyes till I tell you.

Now, please put your left hand towards Me, and right hand on your heart. Now close your eyes. Please, don’t open them till I tell you. Here you have to ask Me a question, a very important question. You can call me “Mother” or you can call Me “Shri Mataji”, whatever you like, very important question. Ask a question three times in your heart, not loudly, please: “Mother, am I the Spirit?” “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask this question three times.

If you are the Spirit you are your own guide, you are your own master. So now please bring down your hand, right hand, in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side, press it hard, and here ask another question three times, “Mother, am I my own master?” Ask this question three times: “Mother, am I my own master?”

Now, as I told you, I respect your freedom, and you have a free will. I cannot force pure knowledge on you – it cannot be. You have to ask for it. So now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and ask Me, “Mother, please give me pure knowledge.” Six times, because this centre has got six petals. “Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

As soon as you ask this question, the Kundalini starts moving upward. So now we have to nourish the upper centres to make it’s movement, her movement, faster. So please raise your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side, press it hard and here you say with full confidence, with full confidence you say, “Mother, I am my own master.” Please say it ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

These things remove your conditionings from wrong teachings.

Now you raise your hand to the most important question that is: you are not your body, you are not your intelligence, you are not your emotions, you are not your conditionings, your ego, your thoughts, but you are pure Spirit. So raise your right hand on to your heart and say with full confidence, twelve times, full confidence please, “Mother, I am the Spirit.” Just say that. “Mother, I am the Spirit.” Please say it twelve times.

Now, raise your right hand to another very important area within us where, by feeling guilty all the time, we have harmed a very important centre. I have to tell you that the Divine Power is the Ocean of knowledge and love. It is the Ocean of bliss and joy. But above all, above all, it is the Ocean of forgiveness, and whatever mistakes or wrongs you have done are dissolved by the Power of forgiveness. So raise your right hand into the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times, “Mother, I’m not guilty at all.” Again you say, “Mother, I am not guilty at all.” Sixteen times.

I’ve already told you whether you forgive others or not, you’re not doing anything, it is a myth. But if you don’t forgive others, then you fall into the wrong hands and torture yourself for nothing. So now, please raise your right hand onto your forehead across, press it hard on both the sides. And put down your head as far as possible, resting on your hand, and press it on both the sides. This is the centre where you have to forgive, forgive others, forgive others. Just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.” Without thinking about them or thinking about what they have done to you, just say in general, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

Now, how many times is not the point. From your heart, you must say it properly. Yesterday so many didn’t say and I had to work very hard on them. So please say it, please say it from your heart once for all, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head, on the optic globe. And now raise it higher and let it rest on your hand. Here you have to say for your own satisfaction, not feeling guilty, not counting your mistakes, “Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.” Say it from your heart.

Now, stretch your palm, keeping your left hand towards Me. This is the most important centre. Both the feet apart from each other. Keep yourself straight and put your right hand, the centre of your palm, on top of the fontanel bone area, the soft bone which you had in your childhood, and press it. Now, bend your head as much as you can, press back your fingers, press back your thumb so there’s a pressure on your scalp, nicely pressurised. Now move it, move it slowly seven times. Here again I cannot, I’m sorry, I cannot disrespect your freedom and free will. You have to ask for your Self-realisation, it cannot be forced on you. So seven times, please say seven times, “Mother, please give me my Self-realisation.” Please say it seven times.

[Shri Mataji blows seven times into the microphone]

Now please take down your both the hands and open your eyes slowly, very slowly. Now watch Me without thinking. You can do it. Now, put up your right hand like this and bend your head and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Bend your head. It is above your head, not on. So little away from the head, you try to feel if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. You can take your hand a little further. Some people have it quite away from the head. So see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

Now, put the left hand towards Me and put down your head. Now, see for yourself again, with the right hand, if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Some people will get heat coming out, doesn’t matter, it will later on be followed by cool breeze also. To see yourself if there is the cool breeze coming, bend your head properly, that’s important. Now, again put your right hand towards Me and bend your head. Now don’t doubt. The breeze is coming from inside and not from the air conditioner, so see for yourself. Again, this is the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, this Kundalini is the Holy Ghost. Now see.

Now raise your both the hands towards the sky, push back your head and here you ask a question, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" "Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of divine love?" "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?" Ask any one of these questions three times. Push back your head fully and ask this question. Separate your hands, don’t put them together. Separate your hands.

May God bless you.

Bring down your hands, please. You can watch Me without thinking, you see. Now those who have felt the Cool Breeze or even a hot breeze out of their heads or on their finger tips, please raise both your hands.

The whole of Sydney is drowned into the Ocean of Joy. May God bless you.

So the Kundalini has sprouted, Kundalini has come out, you are connected with That, but you have to establish yourself. Otherwise, it would be like the marshy land where Christ has described some seeds fell down, they sprouted and were destroyed.

Must respect our Self-realisation, we must respect ourselves. Now you have become saints and you have to understand that it's a glorious thing that is happening to you, and you now become the instrument of God.

You can come to the follow on program, they have nice courses for you, something. You don't have to pay anything, but you have to give some time, that's all, and within a month you'll find you'll become masters - master of yourself and master of this art of yoga. They'll answer all your questions. They'll see to it that it works out. Now we have very good, humble people who'll look after you, and they have all the knowledge, and you can also get My tapes and things where I tell you about - three to four thousand tapes are there only in English language, and in Hindi, Marathi and that way. But unless and until you are established I would not like you to read books about it, because then again you'll get lost. So, first thing is to establish yourself fully so you don't get lost into your ego, as you were saying, or into any such trips. Better get established first then nothing makes you feel that way.

May God bless you all. I'll be coming after one year and I hope all of you will become great trees giving the beautiful vibrations to this great country of innocence and changing everyone. The transformation within you will definitely help to change so many things in this country and you'll be amazed how the planning of the Divine works for you every moment and how you're helped and looked after, guided and protected. It's very surprising. May God bless you.

Yesterday I met most of you people. Those whom I have not met and who have got Realisation I would like to meet. It's already it is ten thirty, we had a music program. But whom I have met is all right. Those who haven't got Realisation can come on one side. They can see. Those whom I have not met and who have got Realisation, can come and meet Me.
