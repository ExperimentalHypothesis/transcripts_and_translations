......better. just relax. Not to feel guilty at all, not to feel guilty. [unclear]. You don't think, don't think anything to think. This works...did you do TR or something, transcendental meditation or something? Never. [sahajayogi speaks]. It's the same thing. Ha. [unclear]. You better now? More than one chakras are catching there. do you feel anything? The swadishthana and the mooladhara, [unclear]. Did you have something to eat here? Now just watch, just watch my red spot.

Just like [unclear word]. Beautiful photographs he has. What was the camera you used at that time? It was the normal camera I used Shri Mataji. Quite ordinary? the same one, different film though. beautiful, some of them are so remarkable, one is here. [hmmm]. Now you have taken to television or? [sahajayogi speaks]. But not on the camera side. [ he says no]. forgive yourself, forgive, don't blame. How are you feeling now? Better? The flow of cool breeze, has it increased. You are not feeling any breeze.
