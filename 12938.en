[Yogis waiting for Shri Mataji Shri Mataji arrived. Yogi giving flowers to Shri Mataji.]

 Shri Mataji: All Canadians are very tall Yogis: Laugh!

Shri Mataji: vibrations still good, I have given realization at least 6-7 people inside. Canada has been really so fast, I do not understand. Now also America is improving, I really amazed. And also in America, they accepted Sahaja Yoga.[Shri Mataji speaking Hindi with yogis]Shri Mataji: its running in you, its love, its compassion is running in you, so why not giving to others? Why not know about them? Its improve your quality, why can't you do it? You will be so satisfied. You have heart, the heart is the spirit, you don't have to do anything extra, you already have it. You have to give love, do not love only yourself, because you do not love yourself also. But if you love yourself you love others. That's the most precious thing and the real joy giving to love others, understand others, feel others is the biggest thing. Do not live for yourself, all your miseries will disappear, all your troubles will disappear. I am now 76, still, I am travelling, because I can't live without loving others[Shri Mataji speaking Hindi with yogis.]Shri Mataji: I am just saying one has to be very much growth in your own love, so you do not get angry with others, you do not get annoyed with others, it's no irritation at all.[Shri Mataji going toward her car and leaving the airport. Yogi's farewell to Shri Mataji.]
