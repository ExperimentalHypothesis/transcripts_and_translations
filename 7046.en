Talk to yogis, India Tour. Ganapatipule (India), 3 January 1988.

I hope you are all very comfortable now and that you are enjoying the food as well. [Applause]

Also we are approaching the fag end of our tour. This tour was arranged, as you know, like a journey through your Sushumna Nadi at different, different points different, different Chakras. In the same way we have passed through various places and now we have reached Ganapatipule where we have to get our Sahasrara fully drenched with blessings of Shri Ganesh. As you know Sahaja Yoga is a very subtler happening within us. It's a very subtler happening and this subtler happening gives you sensitivity to Divine joy. When you start getting the Divine joy you don't care for any comforts, you don't care for all worldly type of pleasure giving things. To you, this becomes the most important thing and the only thing. Apart from that you start seeing the truth as it is. When I say you start seeing the truth many people can misuse this word. I've seen many people saying that they can decide things on vibrations and they have decided certain things on vibrations. But they commit mistakes. That means they have not yet grown up to that state where they can decide on vibrations. So nobody should arbitrarily decide but consult the collective, especially your leaders to find out if whatever decision you have taken, whatever you have thought of, is it all right or not. And one may commit lots of mistakes if you start behaving arbitrarily. The greatest law of Sahaja Yoga is that it is a collective happening.

Now as you have seen here people are from abroad, people are from Delhi, people are from Calcutta, people from Bombay, people from villages, people from various places. The idea of all of you coming here is to, is to create the understanding of the collective. As people start becoming collective and collective they do not bother others, they do not trouble others, but they give joy to others. They are not bothered about their going and coming, their eating and everything, they just don't behave like mundane, usual type of people. But they are very patient, "saburi" as they call it [In Marathi]. They are in their patience. Now this patience is most joy giving thing. Patience gives you the greatest joy. When you are patient you develop all your qualities. I think in patience you blossom the best. But patience is not: "Be patient! Be patient!" Patience is also a kind of a state within us with just this patience, "saburi" [Marathi word for patience] as they call it. You just watch and see. Wherever you are you are.

Now some people are worried that they must get into the bus. Some people are worried they must reach back home. Some people are worried they must get their food in time. According to them this is discipline. This is not. This is conditioning. But what is the discipline is of patience in Sahaja Yoga where you watch everything and you are patient. If you are in the bus you are there. If you are standing on the road you are there. If you are walking on the road you are there. On the contrary it is a good idea to walk. I wish I could but I can't because once I start walking everybody will fall at My feet. Nobody will spare Me. So, I am just imprisoned inside the house, inside the room all day long because I just can't come out as soon as I come out I find there hosts of people standing outside.

But your case is not such. You are free people. You are not bound like Me. So, it's nice to walk a little bit in the evening time, it's a good idea. It's a very good idea, leisurely you can walk, that will digest your food. The food is rather heavy sometimes. It'll make you feel better and just know that you are walking that's all. To feel that I have to walk, I have to go there, once you start thinking you get exhausted sitting here, even if you have not walked. So, it is important that patience should be made the discipline of life. How much patient we are for anything, for anything. Now as you can see, I have to sit here before I don't come you cannot start, till I have to sit here till you finish. You are all free you can get up, walk about, come whenever you feel like I am not. And how do I manage all this, is through My patience. But patience is My quality. It's My nature which I enjoy the most of all. Now I am sitting here is nobody is there I am enjoying it. If I am lost somewhere I enjoy it. If I lost My way I enjoy it because I am there to enjoy Myself.

So, I think we should make a practice now the Moon is out, beautiful moonlit nights, try to walk down, especially the Delhi people must walk. They don't just walk. In Delhi is all right because you can not walk about, there is danger and all that but here is better. You'd better walk, your health will improve, Sahaja Yoga will improve, Kundalini will improve. You'll feel much better.

That's the good part of this remote place that nobody sees you. Nobody is bothered about you. You can live whatever way you like you can walk the way you like. There is nobody to bother. There is no need to have a competition or run about but just leisurely if you walk it is a good idea. I am not saying just to save some money out of the buses. But it is just to make you feel more healthy, just sitting all the time one feels very funny sit here, sit there, sit there, going in a taxi, going in a bus, going in a lift, you just don't move your legs. There is no exercise also in Sahaja Yoga. Walking is the best exercise for all the Sahaja Yogis as I told you. And that's why it is important that you all should try to walk a little bit, if possible. For there are ladies who have children, that is all right, old ladies, old men but even them it's a good idea to walk half a way and then you can go by buses. Something like that try to adjust yourself for these three, four days. You'll feel much better. I promise you will feel much better when you walk now.

Then another thing, which one has to learn apart from "saburi", from the patience, one has to imbibe within one self is the sweetness. If you are sweet you are filled with humour, you do not hurt others, you are not hurt either, you see everything so beautiful and nice, that's the quality of Shri Krishna, "madhurya" [sweetness]. Anything can be done with sweetness. That's very important. Now some people might say, "Mother, sometimes You have to get angry and all that." There is no need for you, I that- I can do that dirty job, you don't have to. You don't have to get angry with anyone. You just show your patience, your love, your kindness, your sweetness. That is how the personality of Sahaja Yoga, which is a collective being, is to be built by people who have patience, who are sweet outwardly, inwardly.

And the third one is the genuineness. Without genuineness we cannot enter into ourselves because our inner being knows what we are. If there is hypocrisy, if there is just showing off or if there is a kind of a reservation within us, we cannot enter inside us. And also, the people who come in contact with such people cannot progress. So, one has to be very genuine about it and this is an individual quality, is not a “samuhik” [collective] quality. It is not a collective quality. All of us have to be genuine within ourselves because it is for our gain, for our “hita” [advantage]. So, we have to be collective because it is good for us. We have to be patient because it is good for us and we have to be genuine because it is good for us. It’s all “svartha”. It is all the meaning of “sva”, svartha. “Sva” means ourselves, and “artha” means “the meaning”. And “svartha” also means selfishness but actually it is self, and self and self.

Now you are changed people, your personality is different, it's shining through your Spirit. In that Spirit you have to see everything. All your conditionings will drop out as soon as you start identifying yourself fully, fully with the Spirit. Fully again I say it fully. Because we do not, we are still Christians, we are still Hindus, we are still Muslims. We are still Indians, English this that. We are still narrow-minded small little puddles. We have to be the ocean. Once you are identified with the ocean, you have to throw away everything and become absolutely clean and detached, "nihsanga" [unselfish; detached]. So, when we are singing all these songs we are saying this. It should not be a lip service. It should be from our heart, we should feel it. But I am happy that your Spirits are shining and the Spirit is enjoying and that you are moving very smoothly upward. Little push will help you more and understanding about yourself.

This time it has been a much better seminar as I have seen it. We must have a proper seminar. Maybe tomorrow morning we might try to have a proper seminar of this brain trust or something. But most of the people who are coming will be really coming tomorrow. So, I don't know maybe tomorrow evening you can have brain trust. They'll be coming tomorrow sometime, there's hardly any time for a seminar which I would like you all to sit down and have a proper brain trust or something or you can have it tomorrow morning and also you can have it day after tomorrow sometime. So, something can be arranged by the leaders and all the leaders of the world should meet and should do it.

As the program stands it is so. But in Sahaja Yoga programs are never just the same. Changing is the sign of life. As I've told you a little root has got a very little small tiny cell at the end of it which is very discreet and it changes its course according to the way it can penetrate into the Mother Earth. If there is a big boulder it goes round and round and round to create a bondage for it later on for the tree to stand on. Then it goes into all various areas in a proper manner whichever way is the best and Sahaj. In the same way it's a living process and whatever works out has to be worked out in that manner. Sometimes you might sleep at ten o'clock, sometimes you may sleep at one o'clock. Sometimes you may sleep at any time. It depends on whatever way the things are moving. We have to be prepared for everything in a very sweet manner with an enjoyable manner.

So, once we start deciding that we are going to be great Sahaja Yogis - we are here to be the Nirmalites - to fight all that is wrong, to stand for right and to emancipate the whole humanity, if you understand the tremendous work we have to do, then you will create your own personalities in such way that you will be able to shoulder this great responsibility.

So, let us see, today is the beginning of this understanding between us that we are not going to grow by demanding, by asking, by getting worried about ourselves. But just be enjoy, just be enjoy and this is what is lacking in some people and that's why they cannot enjoy. They are all the time worried how will they reach there, how will they come here, what is the arrangement, what's this, what is that. Just take it easy and things will work out for you. That's how you are going to enjoy life.

May God bless you all!

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

MUSICAL PROGRAM

Shri Mataji: Can you put that seat, Mike here, it’s better. You can take three, four people.

Babamama: Having spared you one night from the music of Babamama, we have come back with full wages [unsure]. [Laughter]
We’ll try continuing our program in this night, but if you return in the morning, don’t blame me. [Laughter]
We are starting the program with a juggle-bandhi, not the one which I mentioned last time, this is another juggle-bandhi, between the clarinet and shehnai. First, I will ask the artist to get up so that you can see them. Would you come this side? 
He is in addition [to the Nagpur’s group], this is mister [Jugunard Grole?] from Nagpur, he is a be-high [unsure] he plays the Shehnai. And this is Naguro [?], a familiar face, he plays the shehnai. And this is Ashok who has been playing the table, thank you very much. 
They are basically starting with the raga Madhuvanti and will build up a raga Mala. Raga Mala of various ragas. The basis would be Madhuvanti and would switch over to other ragas. It will be, I am sure it will be based on teental [16 beats]. 
Thereafter, there is quite a few surprise items and I would not want to reveal them, possibly you may be knowing but I would, I think keep it as a surprise. 
Thank you. 

[Raga]

Babamama: He is playing the dhun, the lighter version of classical music. 
[Video is cut]

Babamama: He is feeling in tune and he’s completed by saying "tirily" or something of the sort. Now, I will give the mike to Jose [?]. 
Sahaja Yogi: So, we all gathered here for the seminar, I would request stop to the bhajans, to have the non-vegetarians first to the food, because the cook will be angry with me if you don’t go first. And we will afterwards have the vegetarian’s holy food. Thank you. 

Now, I’m going to present you this group from Nagpur, our favourite Abhijit Masundhar on the tabla. Please give him a hand, he’s very tired, he’s been playing for two hours. Please give him a hand, and our favourite Shri Prabhakar Dhakde, will play the raga Yaman in the same tune as the qawwali last night.

[Laughter] In the family, we are known as the [inaudible] that means that the mattresses will tear off but the musicians will go on living the music. So, I’ve composed myself a qawwali, I would like to read it to you. Babamama: Where is my book? We need a qawwali. 

Sahaja Yogi: So, "Khoje Tu Jise But.Khane Me Ya Kalisiyai Me
Rah.Ta Hai Jo Hamesha Tere Dil Ke Dayere Me" 
[In Urdu; the One whom you are searching for, in the church or Congregation
Is the One who actually resides within the orbit of your heart.]
Now, the last verse which I enjoy the most because I enjoy my poetry as you see, 
"Hindi or urdu verses"
Then, 
"Neki Jitegi Badi Pe 
Sahaj. Ke Chakkar Chal.Ne Se"
[Good will triumph over evil, once the turbulent movement of Sahaj begins.]
"Sada Gunj.Ti Hai Yahi Belos", Belos is the name that Shri Mataji gave to myself that is "nirmal", pure. 
"Sada Gunj.Ti Hai Yahi Belos 
 Ma Ke Pukaro Me" 
[This sound is echoing Belos in the Holy Mother’s call] 

So, I would like to present you the international group just in a few words. I would like the musicians, they are from the West, to say some few words for this group. 
So, let us have James here who is right there, sitting down, who will say a few words to us. Thank you. 
Give him a hand, he is very tired. 
"May I have a kind attention to the Western Sahaj please, I would just like to give an announcement. I would like you to all come to Australia on the fifth of May to the Sahasrara Day. Hey, good night Mike! 
So, we’ll be visiting the Uluru, and we will be going to Adelaide visiting some ashrams that is [inaudible], Burwood, and at last Perth." 

So, before we have the music, let us have maybe an Austrian friend just to tell us a few words.

"I would like to thank the Indian Sahaja Yogis for this gathering. You have helped us so much with all the gathering, we have enjoyed so much the music. The only thing I would like to say is that the Austrians have to gather at the end of the music towards that place where the bus is going to fetch us, thank you."
Babamama: Another one? Gregoire, Gregoire. Rajesh.

Sahaja Yogi: I would like to sing a song to all of you. Hey, Rajesh, yes!

Babamama: That was to good, I must say. Sahaja Yogi: "Hari bol, Hari bol" Babamama: A loud clapping, please, for him. He’s too good. I think he can mimic everybody, excepting himself maybe. Now, I will ask the Western Sahaja Yogis to kindly come forward. We’re going to have an English composition. The tune is set by the Western Sahaja Yogis and Antonio and Ajmera from Australia have played a very important role in setting the tune and Christine has been very kind and had to correct my English. The basic percussion will be the guitar but we have added the table to give it an Indian feeling or Indian touch. Just two minutes please. The words have been prepared for Mother so that She would be able to enjoy more. 

Mother has kindly consented to read it to you all. 
How can She please herself while She is al over? What could we do? 
It goes like this: 
"Realization, you are my Self-realization
The Veda providing direction
Upon the richest path
Under protection, under protection
Being energy’s transformation
The torch, the light
The switch to have illumination

Realization, you are my Self-realization
You are the whole and I am your fraction
Yet, strong to count your evil construction 
Suffering in fear of suffocation
You are the answer and the solution
Complete Divine sanctification

Realization, you are my Self-realization
Through You is the ascent to Divine proximation
You free me from burden and put me in motion
Gay abandonment feeling of joy increasing in multiplication
Problems get solved through your simplification.

You give me pure knowledge through your education
Pure desire and innocence, shining temptation
Eternal energy like an ocean
Ever free from domination
Knows no bound and knows no culmination."
Jai Shri Mataji

Shri Mataji: [About Babamama] See, he always had from his childhood this talent to rhyme things, he’s very good at rhyming but this has come out so well, all my congratulations to him I must say.

Babamama: For the Western Sahaja Yogis, I am translating the Abbangar [Urdu] in English. It runs like this: 
"Bramha shodile, Bramhand milale
Ai, tujhija dhami
Janmojanmachi punyayi, az ali majniya kami
Ai, tujiya dhami"
It means, I was looking for Chaitanya and I was given the whole creation, Oh Mother, at your doorstep. It is because of all my righteousness, "punyani", I don’t know how what is the equivalent in English. All my righteousness accumulated over- good deeds accumulated over the past. In my past life I’ve come [inaudible], by virtues of which I got this creation. 

"Chitta pari mam. je je didh.le, Jignyase te te shodhiyale" Whatever attention- because of the attention I got, I was seeking out of curiosity. "Abhav. maz.la tivr. bhas.ta, Dag.dalahi mi pujiyale" In your intense absence, I even worshipped the stones. 

"Gamya agamya sarv.chi kar.le, Bhar.ta pokarli rikami" It says, the secrets and that which we could not understand known and unknown were known as soon as the Void was filled with chaitanya.
"Anubhutine chaitanyachya, Swahrudayi tuz. mi sakshiyale" Out of experience, I have experienced joy.
Would you translate for me, Mother? 
I am finding it difficult to translate.

Shri Mataji: [translates the lyrics] 
"I witnessed you in my heart by the grace of the Chaitanya. 
I realize that religion is without any essence and is destructible without God’s presence. 
Now, I’ve come to know what’s the truth and what’s not the truth; 
What’s the principle, what’s not the principle. 
All the time your selfless love is flowing. 
You are the only Mother. 
Your image is absolutely imprinted in our hearts. 
Different types of faces, incarnations have been shown by You.
You are the master of the three worlds. 
When I was sleeping and from there, I got my awakening, 
My mind has become peaceful. 
My negativity and too much of forwardness are gone and I have balanced myself 
Into the religion of balance, you can say. 
All that I was striving and trying, all that has disappeared at your feet. 
You are the Primordial and You are the first 
And You are the creation that I’ve come to know. 
This transformed auspicious life of mine has – I have, you can say, elected a temple out of this auspicious life. 
With your power, you water this tree of my desire - transformed life. 
By giving the- watering me with the Divine water of Yoga."

It’s a very subtle thing, you know, it’s not easy, I’m sorry, I’ve tried. It’s firstly rather embarrassing. Secondly, he’s my brother and thirdly, it’s really very subtle, I’m really amazed the way he has done it. Give him a hand. 
[Applause] 

Babamama: Raga Handsadwani and the taal is bhajani teka, bhajani teka karva [ektaal, 12 beats]: "dhin, dhaage, tunaka tin dhaage... " This is the teka.

"Bramha shodile" by the group of Nagpur.

Babamama: Could you kindly seat down. The vibrations are so strong. Shri Mataji is saying the whole Brahmand is under the pulsation, is vibrating [inaudible]. In India, for a devotee, this is the biggest tribute. And I’m so grateful to Her and all my Nagpur Sahaja Yogis and artists are grateful to Her for all this. Thank you. 

[Applause]

To keep the tempo going, now we are going to sing to you a qawwali. And we will have the voice of Sanjay Talwar, so vibrating. I had the privilege to listen to his cassette, I must say he’s done a tremendous job. And my congratulations to him.

The qawwal of last year has not come but we have tried to fit ourselves into that role and I’m sure Jose would approve of this. Jose, we are questing, we are also requesting the Western Sahaja Yogis to participate in this qawwali, you’ll see how well they’ll participate, including the seating arrangement. 
Now may I ask them to kindly come and may I ask them to seat. Would they come this side? 

There is a particular way in which a qawwal sits. Come up here, they must see you. 
The qawwals sit in a particular style and they wear their cap also in a particular style. 
Now, I will just tell them how to [Babamama adjusts the caps]
The qawwali was sung last year. So, the words are maybe with you, I will recite the words. Yes, they have been distributed. They run like this, the qawwali runs like this:
[Lyrics in Urdu; unknown qawwali] [Applause]

"Abid", that is you people, the devotees. It’s a beautiful version. 
Only the Sahaja Yogis can churn the Ambrose out of the vibrations. They have the capacity and nobody else, cause nobody else understands hat the vibrations mean. 
1:42:55
[Lyrics in Urdu]
That is vibrations
[Lyrics in Urdu]
That is faith
"Ibadat" is devotion.
[Lyrics in Urdu]

This is set in tune, in the raga Yaman, it is set in tune in two beats as a typical qawwali is. The qawwali builds up the tempo gradually and therefor the first beat is of six beats slow, slow, not in rhythm but slow in its play. And then we have a eight beats in which you will see how the tempo increases. 
Thank you. 
And you also kindly observe the foreign Sahaja Yogis, how they participate in the qawwali. 

With the permission of Shri Mataji, those of you who want to dance, they can come in the front and ladies will have the- but you will have to pay money. We could ask the children to move a little, just a little, volunteers organize this. Little behind, little behind,

[Qawwali]

Shri Mataji: Really, it’s all enjoyment and joy expression of our love, your love for Me and my love for you. Wonderful. 
I was saying that we’ll have this session in the open one day when we’ll be all dancing together, all right? 
[Applause]
Actually, [Kya mune?]
Now the thing is let us dive in that ocean of joy, you all will be swimming, enjoying it fully to your heart content. Beautiful it was, no doubt. Also, we’ll again arrange something like this, I hope so, next time, but we have to do other things also. And I would like you all to be seated and [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi].
All this joy is going to resound the whole creation and the whole creation is going to express itself in another kind of a dance, which you can understand that the [?] echo of this dancing will enlighten and enliven the whole world. 

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi, Anand me....].

[Applause]

Babamama: I will request Sanjay Talwar to come and render some of his most melodious and beautiful songs in his one of the most melodious and beautiful voice that we have got. He’s a big blessing to Sahaja Yoga, give him a big clap, please.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]. 
Shri Mataji: Just put the mike near him properly, all right? 

[Sanjay Talwar sings a bhajan in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: After Realization, you see, he started composing poetry, beautiful, his voice opened also into new dimensions. It’s a very deep devotional voice he has got. But music is so beautiful, the poetry is so beautiful. The poetry is like this, that 
"The morning sun is your own, only keep your state steady " that is for Sahaja Yogis. You have to keep your state steady, keep your attention in control so that the morning sun is your own, all the joy is your own.
