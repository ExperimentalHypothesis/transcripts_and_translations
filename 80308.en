So they managed. So this is what it is, that, you see when, when we want to sell something that is destroying, something that is guile, that is horrid, how do we do it. We have to make it look most beautiful or very pyre and the holiest of holy. They walk like this you see. Who are they, they are the people who are planning how to walk the bank. If you find some three people, or four people seriously walking like this you see with the umbrella, and a complete image dress, we can in a bank, must be somebody who is trying to see how the bank is illuminated. They plan it in such a beautiful manner, the whole thing, the whole surface, that it is very attractive. They must make it attractive. They have to be and there are so many ways and methods. Actually somehow or other they have become through the practice of this kind of cunning. All their lies, so many lies, they have become such experts that they can manage and they do it. While you people who are simple are just lost.

They say, “Mother how can it be Kundalini be that easy.” On the contrary if you avoid you think it over that how can it be difficult. Because it is a living proof. It is a living happening for your evolution. What did you do to become a human being from a monkey? And now what are you going to do to become God from a human state? What exercise can you do about it? It has to be a simple affair. Like your own breathe. Like your own seeing. Like your own eye. You’ve got your eyes. Why don’t you marvel at the miracle of your eyes with which you see the complete canopy inside. It's such a miracle we take it for granted that our eyes are with us because, “Oh we have very beautiful eyes,” we take it for granted. But just think of the miracle, these eyes from where have they come?

There’s a wonderful book written, du Noüy has written, known as Human Destiny in which it says that it is impossible to believe that law of chance has worked out human beings, that through law of chance we have evolved to be human beings, an impossibility because with law of chance we could be at the most be one amoeba, derived from somewhere, but such a complicated human mechanism that has come on this earth is impossible to us. But all the Kundalini knowledge, all the Kundalini science, so far when I read it, I'm amazed. I mean that is your Mother. And a Mother that is a loving mother with the compassion of God within you, which is waiting for these days to get realisation. But people are really funny I must say, when I say that you did not do anything about it, it works out simply, they don't like it. They want to go through all kinds of problems and they want to do all kinds of wrong things. They want to be hit all the time today. Why? God never does like that. 

It is done in the simplest way, in the easiest way, in the most comfortable way so that you don't even feel the pinch. But according to Kundalini Shastra so called, that these tantrikas have horribly spoilt, you have to burn yourself and you must see the Kundalini rising in burning you and there's a heat in the body.

Actually it is the cool breeze that is inside. It is written in the scriptures that you get a wind from the Holy Spirit. You should get wind from the Holy Spirit, and Kundalini, if She is a part of that Holy Spirit, how can it give you heat? When you try to do something for which you are not authorised, then She punishes you. It is not you who punishes, but there is a deity who is sitting down there, at the first centre down below you see in the red centre you see, there She sits in the pink centre She's there, and the red centre that is there, there is a deity and He's the same deity who is regarded incarnated on this Earth as our Lord Jesus Christ. This deity is the embodiment of innocence that could give you a lashing. It tries to persuade you, to dissuade you, to tell you that don't go this way. These people are horrid. They're trying all kind of nonsense because they try to excite your sex for your Kundalini rising. I mean this is something that it is beyond Me to understand how by doing sex have you become human beings from the monkey. Can you connect it any way? Any way?

Thank God we can see our brain is here, our heart is here and sex is down there. What is that connection in our awareness if we have anything to do with sex. Do you find a man who is very sexy in any way much more aware than others are? I mean if you can, or those who are supposed to be the people who are raping and are doing all kinds of horrible things, do you find that spiritually they are very divine people? No I mean I would like to know, when they confuse Kundalini with sex, is it in any way sublimating?

Then I ask about Christ, because at least you know Christ, I know you say there may not be many modern people, but Christ who was a celibate personality. Sex has its own part. Marriage has its own part. Everything is granted, is there, and works, but it has nothing to do with your spiritual life. That's the point. If you have a sanctified sex, it supports. But how do you confuse these two things is really beyond My small brain. I cannot understand. But from the way the people are, you must judge their spirituality. I mean you have known that people who have been raping are beastly people. They rape, they're not divine by any chance.

How do you connect such advanced spiritual people with God? In which way do you find them divine? Is a simple common sense, apart from anything whatever is the fact you’ll find out yourself. So the memory is much higher in the plain triangle where this Ganesha is sitting down below to protect the chastity of his Mother.

So the sex and Kundalini has nothing to do, even saying it is being wrong. Again it would be something like two sex to the mind as far as being. He might be doing it. He was, he had horns in his head. I don't understand the fellow, whom you people are suddenly accepted just like that. For what? Has he had any one person, any single madman has cured himself of mad, apart from him dying of cancer. He had a very unhappy life. And if you read his own personal life, it is terrible. I mean when you see their own life, then at least you must think are we going to be with those lives ourselves? You see, when you try to follow somebody, you must see his own life. You must find out what sort of a person he is, what does he do? How has he lived in this world? How has he spent his life? What has he achieved? And then follow him. Because somebody says something, must we follow him?

After all, if somebody says that, “I have achieved some spiritual life,” alright then let's see how he behaves. What does he do? We should see his own life and we should see his own feat. How he acts. If you put this test on all these gurus put together all these fake and false and horrid people, put together in five cells, one worse than the other. They must have kids. I mean in no scripture, it is described that the divine man should have kids. Is there? There are all kinds of funny relationships with their disciples. Like a 80-year-old guru will be carrying on with an 18-year-old.

Just now today I asked Jane a very simple question. I said that on the road we find, not in India so common, but here that the people are, young people are hugging each other, loving each other, but do they do it under these circumstances supposing a 50-year-old man carrying on with a 15-year-old girl. Do they do it on the road, she said, “No, that they don’t do.” Why? Because you know with your common sense that everybody is going to laugh at your silliness and the stupidity of it. But these old Johnnies who have come here, “I don’t like that,” what’s there to follow? And the ones who have written about Kundalini also, have they told you anything about themselves or have they given anything good to anyone whatsoever? I mean these are the common sense questions if you ask, then you will know how to know the reality. Reality cannot convince, because mentally it cannot convince you, but it can only make you understand that this is not reality, this is not reality. It is something else. But when you face the reality, you start seeing it, and it is so tremendously different.

But if I tell you that sitting down here I am feeling all your Kundalinis. Is a fact. Not only, but all those who are realized can feel your Kundalini and can say they feel your Kundalini and you will also feel when you get your realisation.

But this force, this dynamic force is not acting only in this hall, is acting all over. It's started. As yesterday the gentleman said, “like crack.” It is there. It goes and acts and works and how it looks after you, that you have to see for yourself because you are not in that yet. You are not yet touched the shore of reality. That's why you think that these governments and these economics and these uh, what you call political institutions and even spiritual institutions, have got it. They are doing nothing, it's all mockery going on. The only one who is the Lord and the king is God, and the one who really reigns over the whole world and the universe is He.

The one who has all the power of telecommunication and all kinds of communications. It is He. All are just busy like puppets. He is the one who is using his string as the prologue. You must have seen in the prologue, in the ancient time, even in India, they used to have a person like a puppet, you see. He used to give the prologue and he used to continue, tell all about how the movements are going to be. In the same way it is the prologue is done by somebody else while the puppets are playing and you think it is the puppets who are the play. But, “God is there, yes, yes, we believe in God, we have a picture of Christ. Oh we do believe in God. No doubt. And also you see we believe in church, yes, yes we do believe in it.”

Why? Have you found Him? Have you got Him? You are now in the times for you to get it. You will get it. So many of you have got it, but you have to little bit settle down with it. Because as I told you, that there has been lots, lots of damage in this country by people who brought you ideas saying this is reality. They didn't introduce you to reality. Nothing happened within you, but they gave you ideas, this is reality. Then somebody gives you ideas, like when I was coming to England supposing somebody says, “Oh, England is great and in England this happens and in England that thing happens,” and I come here, I find this does not happen and I feel so that this is not reality. Or if somebody says England, somebody describes England like say South Africa. When I come here I find oh, so this is not. Because these ideas have come to you from all these horrible, superficial, cunning, useless, materialistic people. You have accepted the reality, but reality is very different and very beautiful to be faced. Each one of you should face it and have it and enjoy it. It is for all of you to get it. Nobody can certify for you. You have to certify yourself.

Now here, we have some chakras as I told you, above of that, is the fontanel. Second chakra, which you see is on top, is the yellow one in between the pink triangular bone in the spinal cord, at the end of the spinal cord, is called the Kundalini. You have reached the Kundalini. Now why is it called as the serpent power? Because any power, even electricity moves, and they thought that this, because it moves like this, it's better to call it as a serpent power, but it is not the power of a serpent. You see when the adjective is used before the noun, it does not mean that the adjective becomes a noun. So once you say it is the power of a serpent, everything goes wrong. Now, so that if it is like a power of a serpent and it bites you, you must get, you see, all kinds of twitches and you can get all kinds of dancing poses and you can even take out your clothes with you and everything can happen. Every sort of thing can happen to you as soon as you change adjective for the noun and noun for the adjective. Only in religion they do like this, you see all grammatically, but not anywhere else. You will not find this mistake committed anywhere else. They're very particular, but in this one when they said serpent power, that means it is like a serpent. Or at least minimum, it has something to do with the serpent. It is poisonous, it is horrid, it is extremely heating up, it will not heal you, it may finish.

You'll be surprised that Kundalini can never harm.

You know we think that electricity can be used for good purpose or bad purpose. Atomic energy can be used for good purpose or bad purpose, but not Sahaja Yoga. Try. You cannot. If you want to kill someone through Sahaja Yoga, you cannot. You can cure people, but if you want somebody to hit you, you can try it, all of the Sahaja Yogis can try if they want to, they would not, but you cannot use because this is divine, pure power.

It would be something like saying that, nothing so pure in this world, but I can say if the water, see we can say water washes and people can say, “No the water does not wash, but we can use the same water for spoiling somebody’s clothes.” It is water, or sort of we can say that it can remove the pain. That is not the quality of divine vibration. It is not. Worldly things you can use for both the purposes. That's why I said there is nothing so pure and particularly unique as the divine vibration, which is never spoilt and is never, never can be used for any bad purpose. As soon as you start thinking about something bad, vibration will stop immediately. As soon as you think of harming someone, your vibrations will stop. As soon as your mind goes onto some sort of a destructive plan, vibrations stop. And so many things happen that you cannot do it and if you try to do it you lose your vibrations. It's a very sensitive. So you cannot use it for any bad purpose. That is absolutely sure answer.

Now see how beautifully you are made. I'll show you the red one, then the yellow, then the green, then you have got the blue, then the one that looks like a small and then here is the white, the pistol, and then on top. These seven chakras are there. And all these seven chakras, one by one, if you see in the chart you have got the full idea about the seven chakras, the deities that are sitting on them and how they help, and what is the sympathetic term, what is the parasympathetic, what is the left side, what is the right side of the man and what is the lower side. The lower side of the man is the hell. The left side of the man is the subconscious. The right side of the man is the supraconscious by which we plan for the future. We are ambitious about it.

.......

Take it easy, we’ll work it out and it works and you can get it. We have had people who were difficult, but they have got it. So many people have got it, so you should also get it and all over the world people are getting so there's no harm in taking. But if you want to make it a sort of a cheap stuff, you cannot. It is not cheap. It's the most precious. It's the most vineer and there's a great protocol for it. People are to such an extent sometimes, they take liberties with it. They will use it for small things like, “Oh should I go today to this place or not? Should I see the vibrations.” If you start using it for cheap things, it goes away. That awareness won't be there. For example, this machine can be used by Me, can be used any thug, can be used by anything, it doesn't have any meaning.

But vibrations do. When you are connected with your Spirit, they discriminate, and they find out. If you try to play tricks with it, in the beginning all the Sahaja Yogis try, in the beginning, but then they give up, understanding that it doesn't have.

When the vibrations are flowing in you, you feel completely peaceful. Absolutely. It is a blissful state, you are enjoy and you start enjoying life. Actually your life begins that time. I've seen people who were completely bored with life. They didn’t know what to do. They were bored of themselves. Like you see punk rock people, if you go and talk to them, they say, “We were bored, what to do,” so they are doing punk rock. Like that, people are, who are bored, start doing all kinds of things, but after Sahaja Yog, your life becomes so charming. Every moment you enjoy everything. If it is absurd, you enjoy it as a joke. If it is funny, you enjoy it as a funny thing. If it is cruel, you will put your attention on it and you see to it that it is done alright. So you see you sort of become a part and parcel of that universal being and you start feeling that you have an identification. You have a meaning. You are fixed up in an instrument which is living and which is working and you are a part of that instrument and you feel the rapport. But by thinking you cannot do. That is one thing you must know. By thinking you cannot know the reality, because thinking is a limited process of a limited mind. It is a triggering. When it happens, a triggering, then suddenly what happens, the whole thing flows and you become one with that divine.

You cannot reach by rationalizing it. “Oh, I can work it out, I can put my thoughts alright.” That’s not the way. You cannot work it out. It is a living process that works out like the sprouting of the seed, it works out, and it comes down and it just happens to you by itself. You cannot think about it. The more you start thinking about it, the further it goes away.

You cannot think about it, it just happens and you become. You become that. So first what happens is you become thoughtlessly aware. When the Kundalini rises upon that centre of Agnya, this is the centre of Christ. It is placed between the pituitary and pineal in the centre, which you can see in your all chart. When it crosses that, you become absolutely free, there’s no thought, but when Kundalini pierces this portion, you start getting a cool breeze in the hand. A wave. You start getting the cool breeze in your hand.

If the cool breeze hasn’t started, or you are getting a tingly, must be something wrong, physically, mentally, emotionally with you, which can be corrected. So the Kundalini itself corrects, but for the first time most of the people feel it, you see it is Kundalini is one of the thing, because She says first let me give you an experience so that it remembers. You must remember the experience, so it gives you a shock. You feel. But then what happens, it comes down and cures you here, there, there. Again it goes. Then again it comes down, and it starts curing you part by part and part by part. Ultimately if you actively cure and have it and you feel the vibrations all the time there, completely established. So one should not get upset about it. You see, though Sahaja Yoga is the quickest and the only way, but still we have to get your instrument corrected, this is the problem. And unless and until the instrument is corrected, nothing can work.

So this is what it is, and if you have to get the realization, you have to know one thing, that people who are of very superficial nature cannot get it. You have to be deeply seeking otherwise it doesn't work. It doesn’t work on you. And here we are not like other people who say come along, come along, come along, we must come. No. If you come with your will, if you come in your freedom, if you are really seeking, then it’s alright.

The other day we had one gentleman, a very fat gentleman had come and he was saying to me that one man had a risen Kundalini and he got spoiled and some damage has been done. So I said alright you’ll have to do Sahaja Yog. Your Kundalini has not been risen nothing of the kind. Somebody has told you lies, you have to believe in it. He said, “I don't believe in this, I don't want to do this, I don't want to do that. I said, “Then why are you wasting My time? You better go. Why do you want to waste My time? And why do you want to trouble? Because if you do not believe in all this, you should better go, because you are not paying anything. I am spending My time for you. And if you do not want to have it, better go.” He was quite amazed at Me. “You want me to go away?” I said, Yes. When you will feel that, you can, but not like this. If you do not cooperate, why should God cooperate? Think of it.

So this is not a public thing, stance going on, or any kind of a speaking for the election. Even if you have one person, it's all right. But we do not want people here just have some, you see to know that we have been to a guru shopping, we have not seen this shopping, this shop. We don't want that. This is a definitely a thing where it doesn't sell.

It is you who are the seekers. It is you who are out to and you have to get it in your own right. That is your right. But if you want to deny your right, I'm not going to call at you, “please, please, please take it.” Of course I'm not so harsh like others are. You see they could be very harsh, even Christ you see. Could be harsh to say, “Get out, I don't want to see your face.” You see it really sometimes surprises the way people go on ordering the incarnations. You see that, “You must do this, you must cure my father, you must cure my grandfather, must cure my mother. You must cure my great great great great grandfather, then only I’ll come to you.” Sort of a shopping goes on, see, sort of a bargaining goes on. There is no bargaining with God. It is not possible. Just have it because it is your right. In your own prestige, in your own dignity you have it, in all your freedom you have it. And you should enjoy it. But there cannot be any bargaining about it. If you try to bargain it will run away, it will recede immediately.

There are some people now some very big, supposed to be very big people. They're coming to see just to talk about it. I said, “I’m not going to talk to you. I'm not interested. Are they coming for seeking only?” She said, “Yeah, they were seeking.” I said, “They come, let them come as seekers, but if they are coming to tell me a big lecture and give me a big lecture, I'm not listening.” You see because I know that kind. I've seen many of them and I'm not going to waste any more energy for the lecture giving people. They can go to the Hyde Park and stand on the soap-box.

You see this happened with many people, you see they just come to torture you for nothing at all. I mean sort of they try to show off. They are not sick, and that's why you have to shut there, all right, finished - because this is not a shop. If you can reverse. If you could understand, no, we are the seekers, we have to be. It's a blessing of God Almighty. There are all these beautiful flowers of God. I’ll work very hard. Because sometimes some of the Sahaja Yogis are lost, I really go out of the way to save them, but who is going to run after Hitler to save him? If you expect that, it is wrong. It is wrong. You have not understood, you have not understood the dignity of divine. The most dignified thing is the Kingliness of the divine, and it is not going to fall at your feet for your realisation.

If human beings say, for example, do not accept realization and they want to accept the destroy, it can be created again, the whole world can be created by God. What does it matter to Him. He can create thousands and thousands of people. But it is for human beings to realize that the time has come, for our Father has created this beautiful Earth and created all this for us, and it is for us to grasp in it, and to get in it. And whatever He wants to do, let us have it.

There is another side to God, it is not all the time, which we try to sort of. As a mother I admit to the people, please have this. I will try. The other side of it is a different style. So, in all dignity, in all understanding, in all majesty, you receive it. Receive it, and enjoy the citizenship of God’s grace and enjoy all the power of your own being. These are your own, they are inside, and I only give you the key. I will give you the key to open it. And once you have it, you have the key, and these are all your wealth to yourself and to the whole world, because this world is such which you cannot enjoy without others. You have to enjoy in the company of others. You cannot enjoy alone. It is so plain. You won’t find some people to whom you want to tell this, “Oh this has happened.” Isn’t it, it's true or not? It happens to you.

But he shudders you see, in telling people, “Oh that you are a yoga, should I tell him or not because he punched me.” If I tell him that I pound you.

You have to see. By God’s grace we have lots of people now in London and also we are developing now contacts outside, and so we are going to have many more and then you can share your problems, and also your enjoyment. That is what we are here for.

Now in such a short time, I cannot tell you all about the chakras, but this is all written down, thank God, so you can read it, it’s quite boring otherwise. You better have your realisation now. Best thing is to have your realisation.

Now, those who have been sitting like this, are you all wearing your shoes? Please take them out. Shoes are little bit you see, that's why I came down from there because I thought the vibrations would be better, that's why I came down. So it's better to take out the shoes so that you can, you see, feel it more.

Just take out your shoes, and put your hands down.

Those who have come for the first time, should come forward. Those who have come for the first time, please do come. Just come. Little forward. Not to be afraid.
