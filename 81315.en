it. it. And she was just reading the paper. She And she was just reading the paper. She And she was just reading the paper. She said, "Come sit down." She said, "Sit." said, "Come sit down." She said, "Sit." said, "Come sit down." She said, "Sit." She said, "I'll teach you how to She said, "I'll teach you how to She said, "I'll teach you how to meditate." meditate." meditate." Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah.

So, I thought, "Oh, I need Yeah. Yeah. So, I thought, "Oh, I need Yeah. Yeah. So, I thought, "Oh, I need for everybody listening." Yeah. So he's for everybody listening." Yeah. So he's for everybody listening." Yeah. So he's like, I need this. So anyway, she was like, I need this. So anyway, she was like, I need this.

So anyway, she was saying that she was saying, "Have you saying that she was saying, "Have you saying that she was saying, "Have you heard of noise cancelling head?" This is heard of noise cancelling head?" This is heard of noise cancelling head?" This is 90s. Still 90s like um 90s. Still 90s like um 90s. Still 90s like um um I can't remember the year, but um but um I can't remember the year, but um but um I can't remember the year, but um but it was still, you know, we weren't that it was still, you know, we weren't that it was still, you know, we weren't that tech in those days. She said, "Have you tech in those days. She said, "Have you tech in those days. She said, "Have you heard of noiseancelling headphones?" I heard of noiseancelling headphones?" I heard of noiseancelling headphones?" I said, "Yes, Shanagi." She said, "Well, said, "Yes, Shanagi." She said, "Well, said, "Yes, Shanagi." She said, "Well, that's kind of how meditation works. that's kind of how meditation works. that's kind of how meditation works. That what happens is that the sound is That what happens is that the sound is That what happens is that the sound is waves in the outside.

You have the cups waves in the outside. You have the cups waves in the outside. You have the cups on your ears and there's a little on your ears and there's a little on your ears and there's a little microphone that picks up that sound and microphone that picks up that sound and microphone that picks up that sound and flips the polarity of it or where they flips the polarity of it or where they flips the polarity of it or where they cancel out." So, so what happens is that cancel out." So, so what happens is that cancel out." So, so what happens is that in the cup in the ear, the sound is in the cup in the ear, the sound is in the cup in the ear, the sound is actively banging the the waves are actively banging the the waves are actively banging the the waves are banging into each other and canceling banging into each other and canceling banging into each other and canceling out. So she said that's noise cancelling out. So she said that's noise cancelling out. So she said that's noise cancelling headphones. She said that's how your headphones. She said that's how your headphones. She said that's how your attention works. So she said your your attention works.

So she said your your attention works. So she said your your thoughts rise and fall as a wave. Your thoughts rise and fall as a wave. Your thoughts rise and fall as a wave. Your attention is the is the equal opposite attention is the is the equal opposite attention is the is the equal opposite wave of that. So so so they both have wave of that. So so so they both have wave of that. So so so they both have the same energy I guess you could say the same energy I guess you could say the same energy I guess you could say energy. So when they hit each other they energy. So when they hit each other they energy.

So when they hit each other they cancel. So she said all you do is you cancel. So she said all you do is you cancel. So she said all you do is you just watch your thoughts. you turn your just watch your thoughts. you turn your just watch your thoughts. you turn your attention back on your thoughts and they attention back on your thoughts and they attention back on your thoughts and they immediately just cancel out and you can immediately just cancel out and you can immediately just cancel out and you can be silent um just by doing that. All be silent um just by doing that. All be silent um just by doing that. All you've got to do is watch your thoughts you've got to do is watch your thoughts you've got to do is watch your thoughts automatically cancel in the act of doing automatically cancel in the act of doing automatically cancel in the act of doing it is it's like it's almost a it is it's like it's almost a it is it's like it's almost a physiological you know uh event.

physiological you know uh event. physiological you know uh event. It's nullifying isn't it? It's like It's nullifying isn't it? It's like It's nullifying isn't it? It's like plus minus is zero. -1 + 1 is zero. And plus minus is zero. -1 + 1 is zero. And plus minus is zero.

-1 + 1 is zero. And therefore therefore therefore the frequency of the attention matching the frequency of the attention matching the frequency of the attention matching the frequency of the thought and then the frequency of the thought and then the frequency of the thought and then it's null and void, isn't it? And then it's null and void, isn't it? And then it's null and void, isn't it? And then you're just in that witness state. you're just in that witness state. you're just in that witness state. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

Exactly. So, so, so Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. So, so, so Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. So, so, so she was saying that you just do that.

she was saying that you just do that. she was saying that you just do that. Just turn your attention back on your Just turn your attention back on your Just turn your attention back on your thoughts that automatically dissolve. thoughts that automatically dissolve. thoughts that automatically dissolve. And she said, "The beauty of it is that And she said, "The beauty of it is that And she said, "The beauty of it is that you can meditate when you're driving the you can meditate when you're driving the you can meditate when you're driving the car, when you're at work, when you're car, when you're at work, when you're car, when you're at work, when you're washing the dishes, like whatever you're washing the dishes, like whatever you're washing the dishes, like whatever you're doing, you can just turn your attention. doing, you can just turn your attention. doing, you can just turn your attention. You can be thoughtless." And she said, You can be thoughtless." And she said, You can be thoughtless." And she said, "The aim is to be as thoughtless as you "The aim is to be as thoughtless as you "The aim is to be as thoughtless as you can as long as you can, as much as you can as long as you can, as much as you can as long as you can, as much as you can." So that's what you need to do. So can." So that's what you need to do.

So can." So that's what you need to do. So she said, "Do it now." But I was so she said, "Do it now." But I was so she said, "Do it now." But I was so blissed out that I was said, "Oh, blissed out that I was said, "Oh, blissed out that I was said, "Oh, Shmani, I'm not sure it's a good test Shmani, I'm not sure it's a good test Shmani, I'm not sure it's a good test because I'm with you, you know, like I'm because I'm with you, you know, like I'm because I'm with you, you know, like I'm I'm so um I'm so overwhelmed like with I'm so um I'm so overwhelmed like with I'm so um I'm so overwhelmed like with with with being with you." So anyway, um with with being with you." So anyway, um with with being with you." So anyway, um then she said, "Okay, do it when you get then she said, "Okay, do it when you get then she said, "Okay, do it when you get home uh at the ashram. Go to the ashram home uh at the ashram. Go to the ashram home uh at the ashram. Go to the ashram and then come back and tell me tomorrow and then come back and tell me tomorrow and then come back and tell me tomorrow how it is." So, I went on the tram on how it is." So, I went on the tram on how it is." So, I went on the tram on the way home and I tested it and I don't the way home and I tested it and I don't the way home and I tested it and I don't know Hong Kong and Hong Kong's like one know Hong Kong and Hong Kong's like one know Hong Kong and Hong Kong's like one of those places where you'd be, where do of those places where you'd be, where do of those places where you'd be, where do I get off? What do I do? Like, how do I, I get off? What do I do? Like, how do I, I get off? What do I do?

Like, how do I, you know, I was trying to negotiate? But you know, I was trying to negotiate? But you know, I was trying to negotiate? But I thought, no, I'm going to do this. And I thought, no, I'm going to do this. And I thought, no, I'm going to do this. And I I turned my attention. I was just I I turned my attention. I was just I I turned my attention. I was just hanging on to the handle and I just, you hanging on to the handle and I just, you hanging on to the handle and I just, you know, standing up in the tram and I just know, standing up in the tram and I just know, standing up in the tram and I just turned my attention back on my thoughts turned my attention back on my thoughts turned my attention back on my thoughts and they just went silent and I thought, and they just went silent and I thought, and they just went silent and I thought, "Oh, that's it." So I kept doing it and "Oh, that's it." So I kept doing it and "Oh, that's it." So I kept doing it and you'd have like four or five seconds and you'd have like four or five seconds and you'd have like four or five seconds and then your attention would you know and then your attention would you know and then your attention would you know and then you have to bring it back and then then you have to bring it back and then then you have to bring it back and then four bring it back like this but I did four bring it back like this but I did four bring it back like this but I did it and it worked you know and so then it and it worked you know and so then it and it worked you know and so then the next day when I saw Shani I said oh the next day when I saw Shani I said oh the next day when I saw Shani I said oh you know I did it it works it's you know I did it it works it's you know I did it it works it's fantastic and she said no you just tell fantastic and she said no you just tell fantastic and she said no you just tell everybody cuz that's the trick that's everybody cuz that's the trick that's everybody cuz that's the trick that's what you need to do.

So anyway, um what you need to do. So anyway, um what you need to do. So anyway, um that's what um um that's what she was that's what um um that's what she was that's what um um that's what she was saying about how to meditate, right? saying about how to meditate, right? saying about how to meditate, right? Anyway, as I was researching later on, I Anyway, as I was researching later on, I Anyway, as I was researching later on, I was reading uh Patanjali's yoga sutras was reading uh Patanjali's yoga sutras was reading uh Patanjali's yoga sutras and depending on the translation you get and depending on the translation you get and depending on the translation you get because the translations are very all because the translations are very all because the translations are very all over the place. over the place. over the place.

He he he explains divine consciousness. He he he explains divine consciousness. He he he explains that exact experience on page one of the that exact experience on page one of the that exact experience on page one of the potential yoga sutras. But but you but potential yoga sutras. But but you but potential yoga sutras. But but you but you got to get the right translation you got to get the right translation you got to get the right translation because I've I've looked at many because I've I've looked at many because I've I've looked at many translations and it was only one or two translations and it was only one or two translations and it was only one or two that kind of got it. And it's a little that kind of got it. And it's a little that kind of got it.

So I was just relaxing. I was just sitting was just relaxing. I was just sitting was just relaxing. I was just sitting there looking out the, you know, over there looking out the, you know, over there looking out the, you know, over the city and next thing you know, I have the city and next thing you know, I have the city and next thing you know, I have this like really panicky thought. I I'm this like really panicky thought. I I'm this like really panicky thought. I I'm feeling very silent, very serene. I have feeling very silent, very serene. I have feeling very silent, very serene. I have this panicky thought.

This guy doesn't this panicky thought. This guy doesn't this panicky thought. This guy doesn't know where we're going. We're never know where we're going. We're never know where we're going. We're never going to get there. Like like this sort going to get there. Like like this sort going to get there. Like like this sort of a thought. And I witnessed the of a thought.

And I witnessed the of a thought. And I witnessed the thought and I was like, "Nah, it's all thought and I was like, "Nah, it's all thought and I was like, "Nah, it's all right. Fine." I just dismissed it. And right. Fine." I just dismissed it. And right. Fine." I just dismissed it. And then the American guy grabs him by the then the American guy grabs him by the then the American guy grabs him by the arm and he says, "This guy doesn't know arm and he says, "This guy doesn't know arm and he says, "This guy doesn't know where we're going. We're never going to where we're going. We're never going to where we're going.

We're never going to get there." And I realized I'm thinking get there." And I realized I'm thinking get there." And I realized I'm thinking his thoughts. I'm seriously thinking his his thoughts. I'm seriously thinking his his thoughts. I'm seriously thinking his thoughts. Right. That was a weird thoughts. Right. That was a weird thoughts. Right. That was a weird experience.

So anyway, we we got a experience. So anyway, we we got a experience. So anyway, we we got a chance to see Shanagi in Delhi at that chance to see Shanagi in Delhi at that chance to see Shanagi in Delhi at that time and I told Shmanagy about it. I time and I told Shmanagy about it. I time and I told Shmanagy about it. I said, "Oh, mother, I had this really said, "Oh, mother, I had this really said, "Oh, mother, I had this really funny experience. You know, I mentioned funny experience. You know, I mentioned funny experience. You know, I mentioned you know that." And she said, "No, no." you know that." And she said, "No, no." you know that." And she said, "No, no." She said, "Have you heard of the hundred She said, "Have you heard of the hundred She said, "Have you heard of the hundred monkey theory?" monkey theory?" monkey theory?" And uh I was like, "No, no, Shermany." And uh I was like, "No, no, Shermany." And uh I was like, "No, no, Shermany." Like she was, you know, so full of like Like she was, you know, so full of like Like she was, you know, so full of like even if you didn't think she was even if you didn't think she was even if you didn't think she was anything divine, you just got to think anything divine, you just got to think anything divine, you just got to think where does normal people don't know where does normal people don't know where does normal people don't know these things, you know, like just pluck these things, you know, like just pluck these things, you know, like just pluck pluck it out of the sky, you know. Have pluck it out of the sky, you know.

Have pluck it out of the sky, you know. Have you heard of the hundred monkey theory? you heard of the hundred monkey theory? you heard of the hundred monkey theory? Um and then she was saying that there Um and then she was saying that there Um and then she was saying that there was a study where where they followed was a study where where they followed was a study where where they followed these monkeys on on these various these monkeys on on these various these monkeys on on these various islands somewhere near Japan. islands somewhere near Japan. islands somewhere near Japan. And um monkeys would um one monkey would And um monkeys would um one monkey would And um monkeys would um one monkey would wash its fruit in the water and it wash its fruit in the water and it wash its fruit in the water and it wouldn't get sick. So other monkeys wouldn't get sick. So other monkeys wouldn't get sick.

So other monkeys witnessed that and were like, "Oh, okay. witnessed that and were like, "Oh, okay. witnessed that and were like, "Oh, okay. Well, maybe we should do that." And when Well, maybe we should do that." And when Well, maybe we should do that." And when that number hit a hundred of monkeys who that number hit a hundred of monkeys who that number hit a hundred of monkeys who were washing their fruit, just whatever were washing their fruit, just whatever were washing their fruit, just whatever the instance was, but in this case, the instance was, but in this case, the instance was, but in this case, that's what it was. that's what it was. that's what it was. Yeah. that same Yeah. that same Yeah. that same intuition intuition intuition um would be carried through to monkeys um would be carried through to monkeys um would be carried through to monkeys unrelated to those monkeys on the other unrelated to those monkeys on the other unrelated to those monkeys on the other islands.

So they they intuitively islands. So they they intuitively islands. So they they intuitively understood they have to wash their understood they have to wash their understood they have to wash their fruit, right? So anyway, um she said fruit, right? So anyway, um she said fruit, right? So anyway, um she said that's how s yoga is going to work out that's how s yoga is going to work out that's how s yoga is going to work out in the world. She said you have to hit a in the world. She said you have to hit a in the world. She said you have to hit a tipping point. It's like there's a tipping point.

It's like there's a tipping point. It's like there's a there's a threshold level and when when there's a threshold level and when when there's a threshold level and when when we hit that point it would just permeate we hit that point it would just permeate we hit that point it would just permeate through the whole um world and it'll through the whole um world and it'll through the whole um world and it'll become an intuitive instinctive thing become an intuitive instinctive thing become an intuitive instinctive thing that people want to follow. So anyway I that people want to follow. So anyway I that people want to follow. So anyway I was being bit cheeky and so I said but was being bit cheeky and so I said but was being bit cheeky and so I said but mother like if we think about you our mother like if we think about you our mother like if we think about you our bakti for you bakti for you bakti for you um is that well this is how the whole um is that well this is how the whole um is that well this is how the whole the whole thing started actually. And I the whole thing started actually. And I the whole thing started actually. And I was like, "So mother, if we think about was like, "So mother, if we think about was like, "So mother, if we think about our bakti view, will other people catch our bakti view, will other people catch our bakti view, will other people catch that?" Like, and she's like, "Yes, that?" Like, and she's like, "Yes, that?" Like, and she's like, "Yes, that's absolutely what happens. That's that's absolutely what happens. That's that's absolutely what happens.

That's absolutely how it works." absolutely how it works." absolutely how it works." Then um so so we just have to be focused Then um so so we just have to be focused Then um so so we just have to be focused as yogis, you know, and give realization as yogis, you know, and give realization as yogis, you know, and give realization and we'll hit a threshold where where and we'll hit a threshold where where and we'll hit a threshold where where everyone will instinctively want to everyone will instinctively want to everyone will instinctively want to meditate, you know, or or or take yoga. meditate, you know, or or or take yoga. meditate, you know, or or or take yoga. And you can see it happening. You can And you can see it happening. You can And you can see it happening. You can actually see like one thing I've noticed actually see like one thing I've noticed actually see like one thing I've noticed is that when I was a seeker I didn't is that when I was a seeker I didn't is that when I was a seeker I didn't know what no one knew what meditation know what no one knew what meditation know what no one knew what meditation was really no one knew anything about was really no one knew anything about was really no one knew anything about anything and the it was very fringe anything and the it was very fringe anything and the it was very fringe thing you had to be a hippie or whatever thing you had to be a hippie or whatever thing you had to be a hippie or whatever now it's very mainstream and people now it's very mainstream and people now it's very mainstream and people accept you can kind of see the whole accept you can kind of see the whole accept you can kind of see the whole thing shifting just with our number of thing shifting just with our number of thing shifting just with our number of yogis and the evolutionary sort of you yogis and the evolutionary sort of you yogis and the evolutionary sort of you know the way things are are moving and know the way things are are moving and know the way things are are moving and um so yeah so it was a really wonderful um so yeah so it was a really wonderful um so yeah so it was a really wonderful full kind of experience. But I there's full kind of experience. But I there's full kind of experience. But I there's an addendum to that one as well because an addendum to that one as well because an addendum to that one as well because there's a story there's a story there's a story that well well I was in working in Abu that well well I was in working in Abu that well well I was in working in Abu Dhabi in 2008 Dhabi in 2008 Dhabi in 2008 89 89 89 2009 2009 and um I was um doing that 2009 2009 and um I was um doing that 2009 2009 and um I was um doing that technique which I told you about where technique which I told you about where technique which I told you about where you watch your thoughts.

They just She looked completely still. They just She looked completely still. They just looked empty, you know, like just just looked empty, you know, like just just looked empty, you know, like just just silent. silent. silent.

Anyway, and the ladies talking at the Anyway, and the ladies talking at the Anyway, and the ladies talking at the front of the room and you could just front of the room and you could just front of the room and you could just feel this peace just permeate across the feel this peace just permeate across the feel this peace just permeate across the whole room. And this was being generated whole room. And this was being generated whole room. And this was being generated later, I realized from myself, you know, later, I realized from myself, you know, later, I realized from myself, you know, like just because I'd put myself into like just because I'd put myself into like just because I'd put myself into that state. I had no idea at the time, that state. I had no idea at the time, that state. I had no idea at the time, but I was just witnessing this. And I but I was just witnessing this. And I but I was just witnessing this. And I was looking at the lady talking and all was looking at the lady talking and all was looking at the lady talking and all of a sudden she just stopped talking and of a sudden she just stopped talking and of a sudden she just stopped talking and um she was just like, "I've just gone um she was just like, "I've just gone um she was just like, "I've just gone completely blank.

What was I even saying completely blank. What was I even saying completely blank. What was I even saying like this?" At which point everyone just like this?" At which point everyone just like this?" At which point everyone just burst out laughing because everyone was burst out laughing because everyone was burst out laughing because everyone was feeling it. feeling it. feeling it. The way everyone reacted, I realized The way everyone reacted, I realized The way everyone reacted, I realized that they were blank and that that lady that they were blank and that that lady that they were blank and that that lady had gone blank and she's talking. She's had gone blank and she's talking. She's had gone blank and she's talking. She's she's got the room and even she can't she's got the room and even she can't she's got the room and even she can't think. And anyway, I thought afterwards think.

And anyway, I thought afterwards think. And anyway, I thought afterwards I thought, "Oh my god, I think I did I thought, "Oh my god, I think I did I thought, "Oh my god, I think I did that." like not intentionally but the that." like not intentionally but the that." like not intentionally but the the the the knock-on effect of my just the the the knock-on effect of my just the the the knock-on effect of my just trying to meditate in this room you know trying to meditate in this room you know trying to meditate in this room you know and you re realize that that's your and you re realize that that's your and you re realize that that's your effect as a yogi you know like if you if effect as a yogi you know like if you if effect as a yogi you know like if you if you're in the zone if you can stay you're in the zone if you can stay you're in the zone if you can stay silent and you're a proper yogi silent and you're a proper yogi silent and you're a proper yogi in the zone other people get it they in the zone other people get it they in the zone other people get it they feel it right so anyway feel it right so anyway feel it right so anyway I was reading in one of the piranhas I was reading in one of the piranhas I was reading in one of the piranhas story about this this um jester and a story about this this um jester and a story about this this um jester and a king and the jester says the king says king and the jester says the king says king and the jester says the king says the jester who's the most powerful man the jester who's the most powerful man the jester who's the most powerful man in the you know in my kingdom and he in the you know in my kingdom and he in the you know in my kingdom and he says ah actually it's the old guy down says ah actually it's the old guy down says ah actually it's the old guy down at the temple you know because that's at the temple you know because that's at the temple you know because that's the job of the jester is to poke the the job of the jester is to poke the the job of the jester is to poke the king isn't it you know like pro him into king isn't it you know like pro him into king isn't it you know like pro him into you know pro his ego you know pro his ego you know pro his ego he's got how dare you suggest that some he's got how dare you suggest that some he's got how dare you suggest that some old some old man down to the temple he's old some old man down to the temple he's old some old man down to the temple he's go no no no come and have a look so they go no no no come and have a look so they go no no no come and have a look so they they go down to the temple and there's a they go down to the temple and there's a they go down to the temple and there's a a saint meditating in this temple a saint meditating in this temple a saint meditating in this temple and Um, so the story goes that they all and Um, so the story goes that they all and Um, so the story goes that they all come in and they feel the meditation of come in and they feel the meditation of come in and they feel the meditation of this old saint and they all go into this old saint and they all go into this old saint and they all go into meditation. So they're all sitting there meditation. So they're all sitting there meditation. So they're all sitting there together in this silent state and the together in this silent state and the together in this silent state and the story goes 3 days later the saint moved story goes 3 days later the saint moved story goes 3 days later the saint moved his mind. That's the line they use, his mind. That's the line they use, his mind. That's the line they use, moved his mind and everyone kind of came moved his mind and everyone kind of came moved his mind and everyone kind of came out of it. And then the king in his out of it. And then the king in his out of it.

And then the king in his humility realized that that man had humility realized that that man had humility realized that that man had given everyone this some somehow this given everyone this some somehow this given everyone this some somehow this blessing had permeated from this saint blessing had permeated from this saint blessing had permeated from this saint and that he was indeed the most powerful and that he was indeed the most powerful and that he was indeed the most powerful man in the kingdom from that point even man in the kingdom from that point even man in the kingdom from that point even though he was just a raggedy old man though he was just a raggedy old man though he was just a raggedy old man with a stick you know so with a stick you know so with a stick you know so beautiful story that is beautiful story that is beautiful story that is so so yeah so so I think that's the so so yeah so so I think that's the so so yeah so so I think that's the inherent power that we have is is to be inherent power that we have is is to be inherent power that we have is is to be one with just to be one with God and one with just to be one with God and one with just to be one with God and just our presence like in that sense you just our presence like in that sense you just our presence like in that sense you know know know and you don't realize your growth like I and you don't realize your growth like I and you don't realize your growth like I think that's another thing that I've think that's another thing that I've think that's another thing that I've come to terms with recently I was come to terms with recently I was come to terms with recently I was working with a a guy recently and you working with a a guy recently and you working with a a guy recently and you know he said one day he says and we were know he said one day he says and we were know he said one day he says and we were good friends good friends good friends he says you frustrate me and I'm like he says you frustrate me and I'm like he says you frustrate me and I'm like why he says because you never react And why he says because you never react And why he says because you never react And I'm like, really? Cuz I think I react. I'm like, really? Cuz I think I react. I'm like, really? Cuz I think I react. Like I think I react. Like I'm just like Like I think I react. Like I'm just like Like I think I react. Like I'm just like I'm as liable to fly off the handle as I'm as liable to fly off the handle as I'm as liable to fly off the handle as the next guy, I think.

Right. But but the next guy, I think. Right. But but the next guy, I think. Right. But but but he didn't think so. Right. So So but he didn't think so. Right. So So but he didn't think so.

Right. So So we're um so he's going, "No, you don't we're um so he's going, "No, you don't we're um so he's going, "No, you don't react." He says, "Everything that react." He says, "Everything that react." He says, "Everything that happens, you just take it in your happens, you just take it in your happens, you just take it in your stride. I've never seen you react." And stride. I've never seen you react." And stride. I've never seen you react." And I'm like, "Are you sure?" Like I mean, I I'm like, "Are you sure?" Like I mean, I I'm like, "Are you sure?" Like I mean, I don't know. I'm not sure. He says, "No, don't know. I'm not sure. He says, "No, don't know. I'm not sure.

He says, "No, no, no, no, no." And when when I left no, no, no, no." And when when I left no, no, no, no." And when when I left the whole project, when I left, one of the whole project, when I left, one of the whole project, when I left, one of the guys said, you know, I've really the guys said, you know, I've really the guys said, you know, I've really enjoyed working with you. And I'm like, enjoyed working with you. And I'm like, enjoyed working with you. And I'm like, oh, thank you. That's really nice of oh, thank you. That's really nice of oh, thank you. That's really nice of you, you know, and and I took it was one you, you know, and and I took it was one you, you know, and and I took it was one of those projects where I was a very of those projects where I was a very of those projects where I was a very like not the leader or anything. I was like not the leader or anything. I was like not the leader or anything. I was just like a minion in the whole thing, just like a minion in the whole thing, just like a minion in the whole thing, you know, just another guy, you know.

you know, just another guy, you know. you know, just another guy, you know. And the end of the project, this guy's And the end of the project, this guy's And the end of the project, this guy's like, you know, you have no ego. And I'm like, you know, you have no ego. And I'm like, you know, you have no ego. And I'm like, really? What makes you say that? like, really? What makes you say that? like, really?

Yeah. with other yogis. Yeah. with other yogis. Yeah. And we see our brothers and sisters and And we see our brothers and sisters and And we see our brothers and sisters and we see the bars quite high. Like I would we see the bars quite high. Like I would we see the bars quite high. Like I would say some of the most amazing people I've say some of the most amazing people I've say some of the most amazing people I've ever met have been in s yoga.

And I if ever met have been in s yoga. And I if ever met have been in s yoga. And I if you were to compare yourself to them, you were to compare yourself to them, you were to compare yourself to them, you think, I'm not really anywhere near you think, I'm not really anywhere near you think, I'm not really anywhere near where they are, you know, as an where they are, you know, as an where they are, you know, as an individual in their own progress. individual in their own progress. individual in their own progress. But then in the real real world, if you But then in the real real world, if you But then in the real real world, if you want to call it that, want to call it that, want to call it that, yes, yes, yes, you know, we're actually like, you know, you know, we're actually like, you know, you know, we're actually like, you know, people feel it. People do feel from us people feel it. People do feel from us people feel it. People do feel from us that we're we've got some connection, that we're we've got some connection, that we're we've got some connection, you know, and uh you know, and uh you know, and uh it really is very positive, isn't it? it really is very positive, isn't it?

Shatraj's humble instrument and her holo Shatraj's humble instrument and her holo Shatraj's humble instrument and her holo flute to to play as she wants us to be. flute to to play as she wants us to be. flute to to play as she wants us to be. What's really remarkable is how you What's really remarkable is how you What's really remarkable is how you shared the 100 monkeys uh syndrome, shared the 100 monkeys uh syndrome, shared the 100 monkeys uh syndrome, let's say. let's say. let's say.

Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She was Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

She was Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She was she was adamant that um that basically she was adamant that um that basically she was adamant that um that basically there was a threshold and we just had to there was a threshold and we just had to there was a threshold and we just had to hit that threshold that's all. hit that threshold that's all. hit that threshold that's all. Yes. So that's where we are striving.

Yes. So that's where we are striving. Yes. So that's where we are striving. And when we started recording these And when we started recording these And when we started recording these golden memories first for the first time golden memories first for the first time golden memories first for the first time in 2010 in 2010 in 2010 um the the the the well the sajogi was um the the the the well the sajogi was um the the the the well the sajogi was from South Africa he's actually he from South Africa he's actually he from South Africa he's actually he teaches he's also a filmmaker so he teaches he's also a filmmaker so he teaches he's also a filmmaker so he directed I mean this was such a directed I mean this was such a directed I mean this was such a spontaneous thing and Linda Williams spontaneous thing and Linda Williams spontaneous thing and Linda Williams you know who collated the recollections you know who collated the recollections you know who collated the recollections she shared this hundred monkey um she shared this hundred monkey um she shared this hundred monkey um syndrome and eat that critical mass that syndrome and eat that critical mass that syndrome and eat that critical mass that threshold threshold threshold and hope it happens sooner. and hope it happens sooner. and hope it happens sooner. Oh, actually there was there was a point Oh, actually there was there was a point Oh, actually there was there was a point to that story which I actually forgot to to that story which I actually forgot to to that story which I actually forgot to mention which was that um the reason mention which was that um the reason mention which was that um the reason Shmani went on to say that the reason Shmani went on to say that the reason Shmani went on to say that the reason why you take bundon is because you are why you take bundon is because you are why you take bundon is because you are catching the thoughts of other people. catching the thoughts of other people. catching the thoughts of other people.
