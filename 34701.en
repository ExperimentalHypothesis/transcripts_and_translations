Shri Mataji: Thanks to you Paris people.

7:46 Shri Mataji: Better tell them we are going. Sahaja Yogi: We are all here, Mother. [Cut in the audio] Shri Mataji: I may not be there. But 23 morning, I’ll be there. And I would stay until Sunday morning. Sahaja Yogi: Sunday morning. Shri Mataji: There’s a new dance programming on the evening of Saturday. And so, I think you should see the paper that they- Jason has made it very, very methodical. And it is for people who want to stay in the rooms, especially the mother and the babies and all that. Then, there are big dormitories and then there are tents. So, whenever you want to stay, you tell Me and those who can afford to [inaudible] of that. 

Oh, I’ll have something to drink. Coca-Cola. Such a lot! Give it to Sadhadev [unsure]. What about [inaudible]? Sahaja Yogini: We shared it Mother. Shri Mataji: Everything you did not share. All right, give it to Sadha. I put one tin the- there’s one in the bag to give to Sadha. Sahaja Yogini: Is this enough, Mother? Shri Mataji: Enough. Sahaja Yogi: People think you have a large family, Mother. Shri Mataji: It’s just a part of it, very fractional. And we hope to get also Rajda bhaya Modi for the Guru puja. Sahaja Yogini: And you’ll stay in Dubai? Shri Mataji: Hum? Sahaja Yogini: Will you stay in Dubai? Shri Mataji: I should fly tomorrow. But, you see, the trouble is, there was some problem, I don’t why [inaudible]. But after July, I’ll be starting my [inaudible]. When I am starting? In August. Sahaja Yogini: In August, end of program. The waiter thought that we were interviewing you. 

Sahaja Yogini: Shri Mataji, in Sicily, they have got a huge house in a new piece of land and they intended first of all to make some money doing a kind of Agrico-tourism. Tourists would come and pay for the room but would have work and so on, on the fields. And they said. 
Waiter: Tomate [Tomatoes]? 
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Yes. 
Sahaja Yogini: And. 
Shri Mataji: What about you all? 
Sahaja Yogini: They said also that they would be happy if other Sahaja Yogis from other countries would come ad help organize their stay.
Shri Mataji: Where? 
Sahaja Yogini: In Sicily, in the mountains. As from any time as from now, to put it up. And then it would become Sahaja Yoga enterprise so. 
Shri Mataji: But they’ll have to do just one work there. 
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, one work and prepare and also, they will make some money from the work. 
Shri Mataji: They’ll make some money.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, because the idea is then to rent rooms to tourists and also to have the fruits of the land and then to sell whatever they will get from the land, prune or lemons so I don’t know. 
Shri Mataji: So you make the whole thing, I mean make the whole thing properly 
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, some who are working in agronomy for example. In agronomy or with the earth. 
Shri Mataji: Nick, Nick is agronomist. 
Sahaja Yogini: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: But we can’t afford to take him there. 
[Conversations]

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s a good idea.

Shri Mataji: What worth there? Sahaja Yogi: I was studying psychology but I stopped this. Shri Mataji: You studied psychology. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I was in Iran. Now, I stopped it. Shri Mataji: Do something else. Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: Psychology also, there are two, three people who have done and they are thinking of starting a clinic on psychology. Many people do psychology in London [unsure] like [?], Marie, Rustom and you also, if you can do it because Rustom is doing very well there [inaudible]. And he was [inaudible]. You can have it in Arab. He is already giving them Realization, without telling that [unsure]. 

And I’ll have another one.

But also, you see, it’s not only one [inaudible]. He didn’t say “one” also [inaudible].

Sahaja Yogi: Maybe I made a mistake, but I got the idea that you are the Messenger. Shri Mataji: Yes, I am in the way that I bring the message and all that. But also, he described the other one. Sahaja Yogi: Which one? Shri Mataji: The Rageful. Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly there is a Resurrection time. And at the Resurrection time, your hands will speak. So, this is the Resurrection time. Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: And the Mahdi will come to resurrect you. Then he’s talked about the Doomsday, you see. And the Doomsday will come when you’ll be [inaudible]. 

So, there are two Madhi, I
mean you can call it that way. There is the Destroyer and the Mahdi.  He’s the one who is a – who gives you the Resurrection.
 He said your hands will speak, what more
do you need to know? I mean, they are not, actually, you see, Muslims are so
clever that they are not talking about [Cut in the audio]. You see, this
it the time when I’ll be facing people who are [Cut in the audio].
