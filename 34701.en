Talk to Sahaja Yogis, France, airport, Paris, 01/06/1983

Shri Mataji: Thanks to you Paris people.

7:46 Shri Mataji: Better tell them we are going. Sahaja Yogi: We are all here, Mother. [Cut in the audio] Shri Mataji: I may not be there. But 23 morning, I’ll be there. And I would stay until Sunday morning. Sahaja Yogi: Sunday morning. Shri Mataji: There’s a new dance programming on the evening of Saturday. And so, I think you should see the paper that they- Jason has made it very, very methodical. And it is for people who want to stay in the rooms, especially the mother and the babies and all that. Then, there are big dormitories and then there are tents. So, whenever you want to stay, you tell Me and those who can afford to [inaudible] of that. 

Oh, I’ll have something to drink. Coca-Cola. Such a lot! Give it to Sadhadev [unsure]. What about [inaudible]? Sahaja Yogini: We shared it Mother. Shri Mataji: Everything you did not share. All right, give it to Sadha. I put one tin the- there’s one in the bag to give to Sadha. Sahaja Yogini: Is this enough, Mother? Shri Mataji: Enough. Sahaja Yogi: People think you have a large family, Mother. Shri Mataji: It’s just a part of it, very fractional. And we hope to get also Rajda bhaya Modi for the Guru puja. Sahaja Yogini: And you’ll stay in Dubai? Shri Mataji: Hum? Sahaja Yogini: Will you stay in Dubai? Shri Mataji: I should fly tomorrow. But, you see, the trouble is, there was some problem, I don’t why [inaudible]. But after July, I’ll be starting my [inaudible]. When I am starting? In August. Sahaja Yogini: In August, end of program. The waiter thought that we were interviewing you. 

Sahaja Yogini: Shri Mataji, in Sicily, they have got a huge house in a new piece of land and they intended first of all to make some money doing a kind of Agrico-tourism. Tourists would come and pay for the room but would have work and so on, on the fields. And they said. 
Waiter: Tomate [Tomatoes]? 
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Yes. 
Sahaja Yogini: And. 
Shri Mataji: What about you all? 
Sahaja Yogini: They said also that they would be happy if other Sahaja Yogis from other countries would come ad help organize their stay.
Shri Mataji: Where? 
Sahaja Yogini: In Sicily, in the mountains. As from any time as from now, to put it up. And then it would become Sahaja Yoga enterprise so. 
Shri Mataji: But they’ll have to do just one work there. 
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, one work and prepare and also, they will make some money from the work. 
Shri Mataji: They’ll make some money.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, because the idea is then to rent rooms to tourists and also to have the fruits of the land and then to sell whatever they will get from the land, prune or lemons so I don’t know. 
Shri Mataji: So you make the whole thing, I mean make the whole thing properly 
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, some who are working in agronomy for example. In agronomy or with the earth. 
Shri Mataji: Nick, Nick is agronomist. 
Sahaja Yogini: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: But we can’t afford to take him there. 
[Conversations]

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s a good idea.

Shri Mataji: What worth there? Sahaja Yogi: I was studying psychology but I stopped this. Shri Mataji: You studied psychology. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I was in Iran. Now, I stopped it. Shri Mataji: Do something else. Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: Psychology also, there are two, three people who have done and they are thinking of starting a clinic on psychology. Many people do psychology in London [unsure] like [?], Marie, Rustom and you also, if you can do it because Rustom is doing very well there [inaudible]. And he was [inaudible]. You can have it in Arab. He is already giving them Realization, without telling that [unsure]. 

And I’ll have another one.

But also, you see, it’s not only one [inaudible]. He didn’t say “one” also [inaudible].

Sahaja Yogi: Maybe I made a mistake, but I got the idea that you are the Messenger. Shri Mataji: Yes, I am in the way that I bring the message and all that. But also, he described the other one. Sahaja Yogi: Which one? Shri Mataji: The Rageful. Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly there is a Resurrection time. And at the Resurrection time, your hands will speak. So, this is the Resurrection time. Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: And the Mahdi will come to resurrect you. Then he’s talked about the Doomsday, you see. And the Doomsday will come when you’ll be [inaudible]. So, there are two [Madhi ?] I mean you can call it. There is the Destroyer and the Mahdi. He’s the one who is a – He said your hands will speak, what more do you need to know? I mean, they are, actually, Muslims are talking about [inaudible]. That they are not talking

 [Cut in the audio].

So, I have to tackle those problems, so I pay attention to those problems. Now, somebody might say: "Why Mohammed Sahib didn't talk about drugs?" you see. At the time of Mohammed Sahib, there were no smoking so he didn’t talk about smoking. So, the Muslims smoke like hell, you see? 
But when Nanaka came, he told that: "Don’t smoke and don’t drink." Precisely. 

Shri Mataji: "Samayachara". "Samaya" means time and "achara" means behaviour. And Mohammed Sahib has clearly said about a Resurrection time, many years. He’s talked about Resurrection time much more than he has talked about Doomsday. And he said at the time of Resurrection, your hands will speak.

Sahaja Yogi: And your feet also. 
Shri Mataji: Hum? 
Sahaja Yogi: He said: "[Arabic words]". This is in the Koran: your feet and your hands will talk. 
Shri Mataji: And, hands and feet will talk, speak. Now, but you see these Muslims are using more the Doomsday and same thing with Christians. They don’t want to talk about the Councillor, but they want to talk about the last Kalki. So, just to frighten the people. If you frighten the people, then they will stick on to these. So, it’s a business proposition, that’s why it happened like that. And moreover, you see, now, at the time when all these incarnations came in, they came on one centre or one area like all the Prophets came only on the Void. 

But, while in this case, there are seven chakras so all the permutations and combinations are there. Because Adi Shakti is the master of all the chakras, you see. So, She is the one who can really give Realization. Otherwise, others can’t. And they did what was needed at that time, on that chakra. Like the Five books of the [?] that you have, Thora, all the Five books are common to three of them: Christians, Jews and Muslims. So, the Muslims accept the five books and out of that, they accepted the sharias, that is all in the Bible, whether Jew or Christian or anyone. And it was – or whatever was said was just to establish, with fear, the dharma. But later on, you see, that all the other people added their own thoughts. Thora has got additions from the Jews then the Christians had the New Testament and the Muslims had Koran about Mohammad Sahib. But, you see, Mohammad Sahib definitely accepted Christ. Only thing they said, that Mohammad Sahib has said that: "I am the last to come here as a Prophet." They accepted all the Prophets. 
But, you see, he must have found out that the world is so hectic, he has been so much misused so he came back as Guru Nanaka. It’s the fanaticism, you see, which makes you so upset. Last time, as I told to Americans: "I’ll never come to America." But I’m going back. 
[Laughter.]
Sahaja Yogini: Maybe because also the seekers are calling you. 
Shri Mataji: Yes, there are calling Me, but they don’t know who they are calling. Let’s see. Their Agnya is the problem, you see. 

Really disappointing because they have no roots, they have no roots, very [?]. Even the old people are so stupid, I don’t know what to do, very stupid, Arnaud was telling Me that even old women will wear such sharp heels.
