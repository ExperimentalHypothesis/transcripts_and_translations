"[Beginning of the original tape is missing] Dr. Warren: ... as I said. Again, ladies and gentlemen let me introduce to you our Mother, Mataji Nirmala Devi.

Shri Mataji: Yesterday as I told you, that we are going to have a series one after another. And yesterday I've explained to you the introductory part of Sahaja Yoga. And I said `saha' means with, `ja' means born. Is born with you. It is inborn, is spontaneous, is living. Whatever is born with you is living. For ... fingers, hands, everything is living. And this system is born with you.

Yoga means the union with your Spirit. Simple, it's very simple meaning. (spelling) Yo-ga means to join. To join you with your Spirit, with the Divine. This is born with you. This right to be one with the Divine is born with you. It's your birth right. That is Sahaja Yoga.

Now, to say that it is my method or it is today's method, could not be correct. Because this is the method of anything that is spontaneous.

Like, you see a seed sprouting, a flower becoming a fruit, an egg becoming a bird, or you see a caterpillar becoming a butterfly. All this is sahaja, is inborn with you. And this is existing within us of which people were aware thousands and thousands of years back. Not only in India, you'll be surprised. They were aware in England, they were definitely aware in Egypt, they were aware in Greece. Recently I went to Greece, to Athens, and I was surprised. Athens word comes from the word Athena. Athena is their Goddess. Actually, they don't know much about Her but Atha in Sanskrit means Primordial. She is the Primordial Kundalini. Athena is the Primordial Kundalini the Mother of the [UNCLEAR ...] expressed as the Primordial Kundalini or the Primordial Mother. And She has in Her hand a snake which goes around into circles creating chakras. It's so clearly shown but they are not aware of it. And they even have, you'll be amazed, the daughter of that Athena which is placed among all of us, and they call this bone as sacrum, means the sacred bone. The word sacrum has come from the Greek language, is the sacrum. Means the sacred bone that they were aware that in this bone lies something that is very sacred.

So, they told me that in New York they are discussing only two things. I said, "Which two things are they discussing?" One is the dollar [pronounced with o], in the American way dollar [pronounced with a] you can say and the another is the miseries and the sufferings. I said, "Really?" That the only thing they are talking about is, one is the dollar and the subsequence of the evil one has to go through.

......

The worst thing they did, was, in the church to put all the dead bodies. I don't know from where did they get this idea also, I just don't understand. In the Bible where is it written that you build all your churches on the dead people, walk on top of them, bring all your children to those cemeteries?

......

And this is, all such things have been done to all the Scriptures. All the Scriptures they have tried to spoil for their own purpose.

Now, like Mohammed. Mohammed, you can't imagine how He lived. His life was misery and people tortured Him, these mad people there. I don't know why did He take His birth there. It would have been better if He would have taken birth in India, people would have respected Him. He did later on. But the way they tortured Him, these nomadic people. They had no idea of God, nothing. He wanted them to know about God.

He went there, they poisoned Him, they tortured Him, they've never listened to Him. And ultimately, when He died, then they said that He said that "I am the last Prophet". He might have said it also, might have said, doesn't matter. But He saw the way they were behaving, and He again He incarnated. He has to, any sensible man would be  a ... .

See, a mother may say, "This is the last time I am coming to you". Last time [in 1972] I did say to Americans, "This is the last time I am coming". But I had to come back, what to do? [UNCLEAR: There was/They had] no sense at that time. I said, "Alright, this is the last time, I am not coming". But after nine years I just couldn't help it, I said "Alright, I must go back". Now you would say, "You and the other Mother could not be the same, She has said that She will not come back". Really, I did say. But that doesn't mean I don't come back. In compassion and love I have to come back. Because all My children are here lost, what am I to do? I had to come back. And that's exactly what happened about Mohammed."
