Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Founex Ashram, Founex (Switzerland)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft
Is this the normal size? Not at all. (Yogi: special size). So. Very good. How are you? How was the Guru Puja for you?

Ah Markandeya! Hello, how are you? How is your trouble? Is he alright?

(Brigitte: Yes Shri Mataji, he is alright)

Oh, thank you very much Markandeya. Thank you.

(inaudible)

Where should we put this? Beautiful. Is this from the school?

The situation is the same as I have in My house. Alright, now you sit down.

So today, I was explaining in the bedroom to some of the Sahaj Yogis how this universe is created. And they said You should tell about this to us in the evening. But I think after dinner, is it worth it?

Today I wanted to show off the watch that My children have given me. This also came in the same prize. The watch was so big that they gave Me, for that you really need a wrestler to wear it. (luckily I could exchange it - french translation)

And I saw the watch, and I did not know what to say. You see, it is said you should not open the mouth of the horse which is gifted to you. Of the (inaudible). Because they asked me, we are going for Guru Puja, and we collected some money for You in Switzerland. What should we give you? So I said, of course in Switzerland, watch. So they said, what kind? I said something sensible I would like to have which you can select yourself. So Antonio showed me some Italian nice (Antonio says: it was Swiss). Swiss? They told Me Italian. (Antonio: no no it was Swiss). Ah. I thought it was Italian, so I said I don’t want Italian, I want a Swiss watch. But the name was not Swiss. (Antonio: I don’t know about the name). What’s the name? (Antonio: Ebro (?) So I said, whatever money you collect, accordingly, you purchase whatever you feel like. So they brought a watch. It was selected by Gavin Brown. Actually I did not know. He had not seen it properly, and he told him the number, and such a big watch came in. I got a fright. It was solid gold. And when I saw it, I was really shocked. But I didn’t show any shock and I acted very well, and I said wonderful. You just taking out My left Vishuddhi vibrations, everything I said. It was all false. Imagine, 500 eyes on yourself, and you are supposed to say something that is given to you as a present, it is the most embarrassing position.

It is easy to kill the rakshasas, but to break the heart of Your children like this, very hard. So I said all those things. But then I thought that Arneau could not have bought that. Because he must have tried it on his wrist, and he must have seen such a big thing on his wrist. So he could not buy one like that for Me.

So I dared to ask him that who has selected the watch. So he said it is You. I said, I? I thought I must have forgotten something. I said, not Me. I have never seen a catalogue. Then I thought of the catalogue he had shown Me. I said, no no no. Not Me. I’ve not seen any, and there is something wrong. He said, Gavin wrote the exact number. I said I was surprised. And Warren told me, he wrote the exact number. I was surprised. I mean, see how the myth goes on. It was mythical, but I started, you see, thinking I must have, I must have said something, otherwise how can it be. You see, because if you tell lies all the time, you see people start believing that the lie is the truth. In the same way, I thought how can it be. I must have seen the watch.

Because, you see, all the, everybody was saying that its such a number he said, such a number, and I said, how can it be. Then I said, no but I never told. Still, I said call Gavin, and Gavin said, Mother I saw the thing, catalogue, and I liked it and said it, but I didn’t know it would be so. Think as that.

So, what one has to digest from such a thing, is this that when you are selecting anything for your Mother, best is to see the vibrations. And you should also, for yourself, always see to the vibrations. But Gavin is one of the earliest Sahaj Yogis, and then if he can forget that, I think anybody can forget.

So what you have to remember is this, that God has given you a new personality of vibrations. Now as I told you in Guru Puja slightly, that this watch is, has got vibrations. Tremendous in fact, this watch. And same with the ring. But we bought it only on vibrations, not on anything else. And Rustum said, this is the only watch that has vibrations. So what we bought, bought as two things together, and I think one must not give up feeling the vibrations, and taking decisions with vibrations. One should take decisions with vibrations, and should remember all the time. (Gregorie: for those who can do it). If you try Gregoire, what I am saying, have confidence, and you will feel about it. So that your personality becomes very aware, because this watch is not aware that it has got vibrations, but you are aware. So if you develop your awareness in that way, then you will understand yourself very well. Otherwise you can make such big mistakes.

Now, what I feel about some of our centres all over, that there’s a kind of a collectivity, but not that much of homogenous, spontaneous collectivity. For example, in a group, when I speak, I find some people have full understanding of what I am talking about, and some do not understand me when I go to the subtler side. When I give lectures, they are very happy because they get vibrations, because the kundalini goes up. That’s a very very good thing because that is how you develop. But what about you, who has to now become the Guru? Can you talk to people about Sahaja Yoga? Do you understand it, that you can convince an intelligent man about Sahaja Yoga? Or you have to use one or two persons all the time? Because you all must know, intelligently, what is Sahaj Yog. Otherwise you cannot spread Sahaj Yog.

Now some of you may say that Mother, we are not so learned, we are not so educated, because we have not read so many books. Some people might say that, before our seeking started, we got our realisation, so we had no time to seek through books and read about them, and to know what they have to say. Now, I would suggest that you must also read some books which we have prescribed for Sahaja Yoga. Like Khalil Gibran is there. Like Ramadasa. Like Kabira. Like My books (unsure). Like so many books you must read after realisation. Like Gita also. Blake. I mean, so many of them you can read, and from the angle of Sahaja Yoga, you will be surprised, you will understand the book better, and you will pick up the points which will strengthen your understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

And now when you listen to My lectures, you should sit down and have an intellectual rapport about it. Yes you should find out what it is Mother is trying to say, by talking to each other you’ll understand. Because some people are so over read people that they immediately catch the point. But some do not. Doesn’t matter. It can be explained.

Now you see, Christ was not educated. He was just a carpenters son, but because He was such a great realised soul, that He spoke nothing but knowledge. Now, after that we can also understand that this is one side, very important, to present yourself as Guru. Because you must know what questions people will ask you, what sorts of answers you have to give, which you can go and ask to your leader: if such a question comes in, what should you answer? What is the answer?

Like today, Michael asked me, how do the negative people come in. How do these people create rakshasas (inaudible). So it’s like in a house, you see, where people are very tolerant. Allow all kinds of dirt and filth to accumulate, you’ll find after some time worms will crawl out. Then you will say, from where did the worm came out? Alright. Did he say it correctly? You better now say it.

Its like byproduct of the waste product. (Gregorire: I translated correctly Shri Mataji). They didn’t get it from your expressions, how you were, that you didn’t get the point. So I said, alright now you say it. But it should be clear in such a way that they also understand, because if you use too much of you see, the scholar, in a simple way, as I say it, you must say. Now say that. That it is the product of the filth in the house. Now see, the house is there and we tolerate the filth, means we tolerate the wrong type of people. Say for example. (Shri Mataji says: sons mauvais?) I mean yes, we say people who are bad. Now we go on tolerating them. We are kind, very nice, and sweet, and tolerant. It’s like really dirt and filth, and when we put also sympathy on it, it is like pouring water on the mud. Or in the garbage, on the garbage. And sometimes we do it in the name of love. Now, at that time, what happens that the filth and the dirt stagnates, and out of that suddenly so many worms, all types, all coloured, crawl out. That’s how the filth is created in this world. The filth. Now, then we understand that, why filth or anything creates a worm. (Gregoire: then we understand the beginning of the worms, but not of the filth Shri Mataji). No, the beginning of the filth. Now, so the beginning of the worms you understand.

Now the filth comes from the matter. Because when the matter evolves out, part of it is discarded. Like you go to any gardens, you’ll find it may be dirty. But if you go to a forest, no filth. Because, natural laws rule in the forest. So what happens, that when the leaves fall off they are absorbed by the Mother Earth, they fall on the Mother Earth, they are absorbed by the Mother Earth, and converted into nitrogenous salts for the nourishment of the plant. And again, the same plant produces the foliage. Now, so this is the circle that is complete. The nature completes its circle, and automatically you will find a forest is always clean. But what does the man do? He builds a paved road for his. Or a tar road for his cars. So whatever falls on these roads cannot be absorbed by the Mother Earth.

So whatever is natural and primitive, acts according to the laws of the nature. Then the human ego comes in, and it creates a barrier between the natural laws permitting (inaudible). Thats how the filth is collected.

So as in the nature, from the seed a flower comes out, the other way round in human beings is that from beautiful human beings, worms come out. So what do we learn from this? Because tar roads are there, our ego is there, the barrier is there. Now, how to stop the worms growing further? First of all, we cannot have any tolerance of the filth in the least. Of course, outside in the West, people are very particular as it happens, even the leaves they trim in Japan. They will climb on the ladders, you see, and I said what are they doing? They are cleaning the leaves. I said why? (Gregoire: Japan I suppose) Haa. (Gregoire: they do the same in Switzerland). And the same ladders than they take to Katmandu to put next to the temples and zoom their lenses to some erotic (inaudible). So they think they are very clean people. So the outside looks very clean of a Japanese. You know, we don’t even have one Japanese in Sahaj Yoga so far. They are the cleanest people. Actually, you cannot make them sit for more than five minutes together. Because if they see this thing is a little bit like this, they will get up and put it right. They will not tolerate (inaudible). If their hairs are a little bit, they will just put it right. And the women are so particular about their beauty that they shave themselves. Keep the skin alright. (inaudible) Electrical shavers.

So the outside cleanliness is too much. So we have to see about our inside cleanliness. That is very important. Because, as I said, first of all, we must have a proper knowledge about Sahaj Yog that we can talk to anyone intelligently. And you can ask questions, and get answers. If you still are not answered, you can write to me, I’ll answer you. But, get your knowledge right.

When I first met Gregoire, he asked me in the first day 100 questions per hour. So you have to find out, not just for asking questions, but you must find out if you can say something about Sahaj Yog, or not. Or what questions you have which you cannot answer. Now as it is, you know that to meet someone you must have a personality which is sensible. Your eyes may be sparkling, because you are a realised soul. But you have to have also a personality. We have in Sahaja Yoga, many ways and methods by which we can clear our health. So we have to have a good health to present to others. Should be a good, radiant health, otherwise people will never listen to somebody who is talking like a tubercular patient. Or else somebody who is an aggressive lion. But a person who is dignified, in the centre, and talking like a grownup, matured personality.

Now then, another thing I must tell you, that whatever I am, or whatever way I dress up, or whatever I do, people excuse me, but they will not excuse you. Somehow, I have a privileged position. Somehow. Now see, I am wearing the shawl upside down, so they will say that, see Mother is not bothered about anything. She is so above everything. They will never say, She is lousy and thats why but it is a fact, I am a lousy person. And also to give Me credit, they will say, no this way it looks better, Mother knows better vibrations so She has put it this way.

That’s what, when the big watch I got, they all said, oh must be nice. And that shows that the befooling was mutual. So, you people, in the beginning you have to build up your reputation as I have and you won’t have any problem, you can go on whichever way you like. I mean, some people go about still like hippies. I tell them, be dressed up elegantly. Not like a dandy person, but elegant. Like, I would not like you to dress up like Napoleon tight pant, or some sort of a funny dress like they used to wear. But you must, according to the modern idea, Samayachar. Whatever is regarded as a decent dress you must wear. Because the people who you will meet, they will be superficial first and their attention will be on all these things. And the best way to impress others, I must tell you, is to keep quiet and listen to them whatever they want to say. And then, afterwards, slowly you tell them what is the answer, or what is the solution, or maybe what you find a little difficult or different.

But it should be done with the idea of the timing, with whom are you talking, and as a man or a woman. The way it should be, very much understood in its all aspects when you are dealing with a person. And gradually you will find that as soon as you become thoughtlessly aware the face itself will impress another person. And also, when you are talking to others, even when you are giving your opinion, you should judge how much the fellow can take in, because no use wasting your precious words.

Once it happened, that in one program they said there is a fellow who is not getting out, he is troubling us too much, so I knew somebody who was extremely boring person in Sahaja Yoga. So I told him, go and handle the fellow, and when I was entering the hall, I saw this man running with the 500 miles (inaudible). So, I mean, we should not bore others with our Sahaj Yog. It is a very interesting thing and it should not, people should not come to know that Sahaja Yogi, God save me bapre (inaudible) he was hitting me all the time with Sahaja Yoga bat. But whatever you do, it should be a chocolate above it, and inside, whatever you want to give, should be inside. The medicine.

How I started todays lecture, do you remember? (Gregoire: with Your watch). Talk of something else here and there, and then hit the point. Create an atmosphere of pleasantness, but not of, some sort of a old man sitting with a drawn face. But one should not also be childish. I do not mean you should be childish, but that doesn’t mean you should be serious. Something in-between which you should try to have. That way, I have some advantages. I can have My eyes very angry, and face very smily. You have seen some photographs like that. So you see, if it works out with My smile, the other way around, My eyes put it down. So this is how you should be in the centre, neither frivolous, nor serious.

Now, the thing is the gestures that we use in Sahaja Yoga are very important. Some people actually speak, as if an Englishmen about to speak the French. Like an Englishmen about to speak the French. Englishmen don’t use so much of their hands, but to make it a French you must (inaudible)... because he is speaking English, you see, he’s an English manner where they are not supposed to take their hands even from the pockets. And here the French ... when they talk so the fellow is trying to make both things look very natural, but he is going. When he says I’ll hit him, he says I’ll hit him, like that you see.

So, then we understand that our gestures should be such a way that it should be dignified, respectful to another, and respectful to yourself also. I once saw a Sahaj Yogi trying to be a Guru. So he was sitting with both the legs like that, on top of a chair, and talking to people like this, you see. Sitting like this and people were looking at him, and everybody was laughing under the sleeves. It was impossible for them to listen to him. He was a very learned man, very good. But he was sitting stupidly. I said, why are you sitting like that? And this one, you see, he said, I get tired. Now you have to make your body as such, that you should sit straight, and talk to people in a manner that looks dignified. Now you have known about Me, that at this age, I’ve sat for nine hours continuously like this without any support. Straight like that. 9 hours, not even going to the bathroom or anything. Or nobody has seen that I go to the bathroom or anything from any lectures, or any meetings. If I am addressing for hours together, I never go out in-between. So you must make your body under your complete control, that you present yourself as a person who is a master of your body.

For that, you have to practice a little bit of abstinence, and little bit of penance. Sitting on the ground, for example, is a problem with you, now we have takes time. We have so many exercises which you should do. Try to sit on the ground in a straight way. And when, you see, your body will pain a little bit first of all, it will give you trouble, try to bend it up a little. Make your body understand that you have to do it, the way of sitting, talking, everything has to be very very dignified. So you make a personality which looks something exceptional, something greater, something which is special for everyone. Otherwise, how will you impress the people who come to you, who are so superficial?

Now as soon as somebody comes in, also I have seen in the ashrams especially, you are a bhoot. You caught your bhoot from your mother, you caught your bhoot from your father. You are this, you are that. You go on telling them. One fellow, I sent him to the ashram, and he telephones to Me after some time, he says Mother, what do You mean by bhoot. First time he ever goes to an ashram, and he asks me on the phone, what do You mean by bhoot? I said what do you mean? You see, they told me you are a bhoot. I said, now don’t ask Me that question. It’s alright. Whatever they have said doesn’t matter. Again I told him a lie. I said bhoot doesn’t mean anything, but it means a person who lives in the past. So then he came to Me, and today he is one of the very great Sahaj Yogis. So we would have lost him. But ashram is a place where it has to be clean, and it has to be pure, one has to be careful that you don’t entertain people who come with problems, because they will upset the children, they will upset the other women. They can upset, because if they are not clean people inside, there will be a problem.

So what do you do there? You have a discretion. Like you have an outside group, or another group where everybody meets, just to take them there. Don’t take to the meditation room. Don’t take them to other places. Just take them to a place which is just kept for general purposes. As we say, (inaudible) for everyone. And don’t tell him about bhoot to begin with, because they don’t know anything about it. So first of all, you talk to him very nicely. Make him sit down. Make him be comfortable, try to give him realisation. See that he establishes his realisation. Then he himself will start seeing bhoot in himself. And ask, with loving tone, the man if he would like to take tea or something because one of the things that is the beginning of seeking is food. (Gregoire: Shri Mataji, I think this has spread all over now. Everybody is drinking tea now in Sahaja Yoga) No no, I will not say tea. What you can do is ask for something to drink.

Now as he has pointed out, that tea now has become a craze, because you were having something very stronger, so now it has come to a minor stuff. But say till the age of My 47 years, I did not take tea. Till I opened the Sahastrara. Then, at the Sahastrara point, it’s very difficult in England that you say I don’t take tea, because they usually bring milk. Then they have to get something else because that’s the first thing they offer you in England. But my husband always, you see, was saying that I only take tea. Not I drink, nor do I do at least take tea with me. So whatever you decide, you take. I said, alright. He said, I take three cups in the morning; three cups in the evening. I’ll take them with you. I said alright. Three cups in the morning, three cups in the evening time. Otherwise I will not take any other tea. Never. So I do not take any other tea. So just now, if I have to take, at the most, because I am talking to you just, so I’ll take Chinese tea which is simple. But a real tea, I’ll only take measure six cups because I have to please my husband. But if I don't get it, I don’t have problems as you have. Nothing. Nothing touches Me. Because after Sahastrara, I knew it will also happen to you. That even if you take tea, it should not be a habit.

But what I have found, in Kaliyuga, everything that was different is something very funny, because any realised soul could not take alcohol before. But in Kaliyuga, I’ve seen, realised souls can take even alcohol. Taking alcohol is not the point, but forming a habit, because I tell you, my husband was, my father was a realised soul, and he used to smoke because he had to work in the night. And one day a doctor told him that now you don’t smoke. Next day he stopped. He started under the advice of the doctor smoking, because he had gasses trouble, so he said if you smoke you’ll relax. So he took to smoking. And after 10 years the doctor said, now you stop and he stopped immediately.

See, so this is the sign, like a realised soul takes no time to give up anything. Is not attached. Because for social relationship, we have to have some sort of a drink. I mean, somebody comes to your place now, you have to offer something. Tea is the cheapest thing you can offer also, and is a good way. Otherwise, we can’t offer alcohol in Sahaja Yoga. We may not even offer juices because throat will be bad in the western countries. See we should give this one. So only thing you can offer is tea. And I thought Samayachar tea is alright because we have to have rapport. But if it is forming a habit, then you must look after yourself. Habit should not be.

And the whole thing is that, inside and outside should be beautiful for a Guru to be impressive. Like I have seen, some people have a proper breeding at home, and some don’t have. But there is no excuse for that. Everybody must learn how to behave. As you go to somebody's house, say for example, I have seen some Sahaja Yogis will just first of all go and sit at the table, even before I have sat. Or if they, one day in India the custom is to take the (inaudible) you see like this, so the fellow took the whole of the plate on his lap and started eating. So I think you become even over simple, and over sort of (inaudible). It’s all so artificial.

Like today, I was saying, to show off my ring, I’ll talk like this all the time. (inaudible) Like this. Also to sit without bangles, without anything which I normally wear. Hair like that. It’s all so artificial you know. So you should be natural, normal, and so sweet, that others, when they go from you should remember that interview with you, because of your sweet personality, because of your good behaviour, your gentlemanliness, and your kindliness. You're respectful about others.

The worst of all is, that some people come from outside, and Sahaj Yogis start fighting amongst themselves. It’s the worst. Or criticising others. Now for example, I would say Arneau is the leader here. This I think Japanese are better. One person will speak. There will be 20 in the delegation, only one person will speak. They won't even pass remarks. They won’t even send chits, nor say anything in Japanese language. So, supposing Arneau is there, you all should decide beforehand, or when he goes away, then you should decide. But when he is talking, everybody should not come out with something new, and then quarrel. Its very very wrong, and its very common. But as you grow in Sahaja Yoga, and as you get the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, as you cleanse yourself from within, you will be surprised, your jealousies will go away, your bad habits will go away. You’ll be naturally beautiful.

So the first and foremost attitude of a Sahaja Yogi should be, that he should, from inside, cleanse himself completely with understanding that if he is cleansed, it is his advantage. Because as soon as you cleanse yourself, your dimensions will increase. You will understand things much better, you answer them better, and you can do thousand and one things. Alright, now see, we have strong person like Rustum or Gregoire, they have even learnt Sanskrit now, and all the mantras, most of them which you said in My Guru Puja, were composed by Rustum. They had never learnt Sanskrit all their lives. So you should not stop reading, you must read Devi Mahatmiyam, you have to read so many books. You should not stop reading. Each one of you can write at least one book on Sahaja Yog. Each one of you can give realisation to 10,000 people minimum. But you have to appeal to people. And that, that is the, that is the difficult part because people use publicity, they use image building up, they do this, they do that, while we do not do all those things. But our inside speaks for our outside. So we have to discipline ourselves, we have to meditate every day. We have to know that we all have to combine together despite all our differences, otherwise we cannot fight the formidable enemy of God, which is satanic. Even for military services you have to discipline yourselves. Then you, for Gods military, how much we should discipline? But if you ask anyone, how are you, they say. (Gregoire: better?) (inaudible) the French. (Greogire: come si, comme ca). So then, I say.

Some of them come, such bad Agnya, it catches Me. My head starts bursting with Agnya, but they don’t know they have Angya, till I tell them, put their finger, and they take out the Agnya. It’s terrible, some of them have such terrible Agnya. They don’t know they have. How to tell them also? They will be frightened. So now you face yourself. See, how your vibrations are? Why are they not clean? How to work it out. If you are not feeling in the hands, or in the body, than what is the reason? Work it out. Work it out. Pay attention to it. Its important that you should pay attention to yourself.

What is it? What do you want? Sit down. Sit down. When I am talking, you should not (Brigitte: the children are crying. The children are crying). Let them cry for a while, doesn’t matter. While I am talking, you should not get up. That’s not proper. Let the children cry, they are not, something is not happening to them. There is no snake in the house. Doesn’t matter. Children always do like that, but while I am talking, don’t get up. Alright? Pay attention fully. That’s not proper, it’s not good. And then, these are little little things. Who is talking to you just now? I’ve seen in that Robert Hall, where they. Robert or Edward, what hall is that? Where they have the music program. Albert Hall. When they start the music, you are not even supposed to cough, and people sit without coughing for three hours, four hours.

But in Sahaja Yoga, the problem is, the discipline has to come from within. If you are sitting and listening to Me, you are not to listen to anything else whatsoever. That’s the sign that you are a Sahaja Yogi. If you believe that I look after everything, then you leave it to Me. What are you worried about? You understand that point? So last of all, the point is, complete understanding of your Mother. If you achieve that, you’ll have no problem. I assure you. But it is very difficult, because your Mother is a Mahamaya. At Sahastrara She is Mahamaya. You cannot make Her out. She is so simple, that you cannot make Her out. She will talk to you about everything, like even money, vegetables, this, that, in such a manner, like a very ordinary person. You must know the One who is the Adi Shakti has to deal with A to Z. Everything. And She has to have all these things in Her, otherwise She cannot manage the show. So with children, She will be like children. With you, She will be like a mother. But those who are very highly developed souls, I’m Adi Shakti. I want you all to develop that state. Let him come, let him come. You develop that state, alright? And when you develop that state, you’ll be amazed that I won’t have to tell you anything.

Everybody will see the reflection of your Mother in you, if your life, in your personality. You don’t have to say anything about it. Every inch of you will show this. So I bless you again. After the Guru Puja, now you try to become Gurus, all of you. So the first and the last thing you have to achieve is the Guruhood. No, nothing else is more important. For example, you are a mother or a wife, or a husband, or this. It’s not important at all. But develop your Guru, and you will be amazed, everything will follow suit.

Alright? So may God bless you all. May God bless you, all of you. I hope you will listen to this lecture again and again, and try to imbibe what I have said. It is meant for each one of you, not for anybody else. Just absorb that now. So you reflect it back upon yourself, because you all have to become Gurus yourself. And do not transfer it to anybody else. You see for yourself, what I have said is for my own connection. This is what human beings lack, and they are very tolerant about themselves. That’s what your are not to do.

May God bless you.

Gregoire, this was not changed, is it alright? (Gregorie: Shri Mataji, it is all on the video cassette).

So may God bless you all. I will not be able to see you again till I come back. As I have told you, you have to do the work now. You have to get more people. Talk to them. For this program that I am coming, we have to have lots of people around. Everybody has to work very hard. Every way  that you can help, everyone individually should help. It should not be that, that is the job of one Mr X Y Z. Everyone should try to do whatever is possible. I hope you will understand the importance of time, time. Time that you have given Me is to indicate that time is important.

(Gregoire: let us stand up and take the mantra of Shri Mataji)
