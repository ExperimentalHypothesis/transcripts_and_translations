Hong Kong, Rede zu Sahaja Yogis 18. Dezember 2001, Park Lane Hotel, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong

Ich bin so glücklich alle diese Songs von Euch zu hören, welche auf der ganzen Welt gesungen werden. Also Ihr werdet wichtiger Bestandteil sein von diesem Ganzen. Wir sind überall Sahaja Yogis. Ich war in Amerika überrascht zu finden, daß 300 Yogis waren gerettet in dieser Krise.
Weil sie nicht hatten einen einzelnen Yogi der verloren war. Es ist außergewöhnlich, so daß irgendwelche von ihnen waren verspätet, irgendwelche von ihnen waren erschöpft und irgendwelche liefen in die andere Richtung. Alle von ihnen sind Sahaja Yogis. Soviele Leute sind gestorben in Amerika, aber keineswegs waren sie Sahaja Yogis. Es ist ungewöhnlich wie Ihr habt zurückgeschaut und seid geschützt durch das Göttliche....daß ihr kommen solltet all die Wege hier, alle von euch, alle von euch, besonders die Chinesen. Ich fühle daß wir viel machen können. Sie haben bereits eine Tao Tradition. Ich weiß nicht wie viele lesen Tao. Habt ihr gelesen Tao? Jemand? Tatsächlich er ist Tao ist ein Sahaja Yogi und er beschreibt seine mentale

Situation und all die Probleme haben sie in einer solchen schönen Art als ob ihr lest, es fühlen wollt, daß ihr sehr gut beschreibt all dieses. So oder so Taoismus wurde nicht praktziert und es werden richtige kontroverse Bücher für alle Akademiker, das ist alles. Aber jetzt denke ich sie belebt. Ich berichtete dies. Heute existiert in China Tao Religion und sie praktizieren Tao. So wir sind Taoisten. So können wir es unter dem Kommunismus ausarbeiten, sie wünschen nicht viele Religionen und sie tun nicht wieder wünschen einen Kult. Wir können so wieder werden Tao und wir können sagen wir sind Taoisten. Sie wollen keinen Widerspruch haben. Sie suchen auch....Ich war überrascht daß einer von (diesen) Mr. Li. welcher war der, ich denke, Ministerpräsident von China. Er war da gewesen und da war ein Foto von mir bei den Leuten von Austria und Mr. Li ging damals zu irgendeiner offiziellen Tätigeit und davor zeigten ihm das Foto und er sagte, Ich erinnere mich an diese Lady. Sie ist eine außergewöhnliche Persönlichkeit.“ Ich weiß nicht, was er dabei dachte. Aber er sagte, „Ich würde gerne wissen wie es ihr geht.“ Sie sagten, „Sie ist unser Guru und sie hat dieses getan für uns.“ Er war gerührt, so berichtet er sein Attache für Kulturelle Angelegenheiten geht und trifft Sie, weil er keine Zeit hatte und ich war auch nicht da und ihr

I don’t know what made him think like that. But he said, „I would like to know how are you there.“ They said, „She is our Guru and She’s this and She’s done this for us.“ He was very much touched, so he told his attaché for Cultural Affairs go and meet Her because he had no time and I was not there also and you must see Her and know about Her, even though they were communist and all that. So he came to see me. Closed his eyes and then he (his Kundalini) came up. Then I told him all about it. He said there was Tao in our country. He was so respectful. He was to be there at 10.00 but he was there at 9.30. He said „There is lot of misunderstanding about religion in China – we were communist. Now we have started in a democratic way gradually, so we want to do at least. You teach me.“ So I said „alright“ and I gave him Realisation and he’s still there in China. What’s his name? And if you happen to go and you can meet him. He has started a little group there, working it out. I would like to meet Mr Li also sometime outside China. I’m sure it will work out very well. What I liked about Chinese is that they were extremely humble, very respectful people. Then I went to their women’s conference. The three boys they had sent. They gave us a complete floor of a great hotel to stay in. I don’t know why they had arranged all these things, and they sent me two cars, one for my wheelchair and one for my-self. And these boys were running about and they took me out to different places. Very, very nice. One of them said, „Mother, tomorrow I won’t come.“ I said „Why, what’s the matter?“ „Tomorrow I am getting married.“ I said „You are getting married and all the time you are with me?!“ He said, „I enjoyed very much.“ You see, even when I went there they took me to the con-ference so fast there was no time in between ... and when I
came to the airport also they came. They had tears in theireyes. They were very loving, very nice people. They have suffered a lot. But here you have been all right. I meant it’s still a democ-ratic country and one should go about in a proper way. I am sorry some of our Sahaja Yogis were lost. They were,I think, stupid. They don’t understand many things. I mean they want to be on their own and all that. You have to be connected to the mains. If you are not connected to the main tree how will you prosper. I know who’s who, what they are doing, what is wrong with them. I know all about them. They have no business to decide about it, but they were very new and they had come first time to Sahaja Yoga. Also, they were very much tempted I think. So we have to spread Sahaja Yoga. Now, luckily somebody, some Sahaja Yogis met Mr Bush and they told him about Sahaja Yoga and they gave him Self-Realisation and all that, and Mr Bush was so impressed he used to write to me. He said that I want some books.and I told him, when he was in two minds, what to do. (He said he was) not spiritually equipped and the war has broken out. I wrote him a nice letter that he has to fight because if you are spiritually equipped you will have
more chance. And when I went to America they were very disturbed. They arranged for our reception. He sent twenty-five people to see me. He was all the time worried about my safety and looked after me. Whatever I wrote to him he used that in his lectures. So many words he has
used that I have written. The thing is, I have seen some people who are very (important). They just recognise me. Like in India, one Home Minister, he has tremendous respect for me. He
came to my house and he got his Realisation. And also we have, I must say, in Australia also a Prime Minister (David Lange of NZ) he came. In India we have a leader called Bal Thakre. He is such a nice man, very strong. He was against all the Muslims organizing things against In-dia,
which is a fact. They are there. He used to say you have to be careful with the Muslims. They were converting people but how so many problems they have created. But he was so nice, so sweet. But people used to say that he was an atheist. But he was the first man to be, apart from
the Home Minister. Even he was so much attached to me. One day he came to my house in a helicopter. The heli-copter was shaking like this. So I said, „Why did you come by helicopter, why didn’t you come by train, or by car?“ He said, „Oh, no. I have made this special garland for you and I thought if I come by car it will take so much time that the flowers would be finished, so that’s why I came by heli-copter.“ He was so much humbled before me. But he speaks so well and he is very famous. People respect him very much in India. So now a new system has started. Because of these con-versions in India. They got these, especially these poor Muslims into their trap. Not only that but also they have trained them in such a way that they are not educated.
They don’t know anything. All kinds of wrong things they are doing. You see the rift between the two societies. But there are some Muslims in India who are sensible. We have some Sahaja Yogis, twenty-five young boys who are Muslims in India. They say they are all lost people.
„Mother you must save them.“ But there’re very fanatic. Some of them are very, very fanatic. I said, „All right, I’ll try.“ You will be very happy to know that there is a country in Africa called Benin and Ivory Coast, like that. Seven coun-tries ruled by French. They all were Muslims. But they have all become Sahaja Yogis. I said, „Why didn’t you fol-low the French, be Christians?“ „Because the French were licentious, immoral. So we thought best is to be a Muslim.“ They were all Muslims. Now they have become 20,000 Sahaja Yogis and there will be many more. Like you see, even these religious people mislead and make fool out of them. They are all very well educated. Even the President of the Ivory Coast is a Sahaja Yogi. The President himself, he’s a Sahaja Yogi. So you can imagine how things are working out in so many countries. This is the time people are seeking the Truth. They want to have the Truth. That’s how in every place, in every country Sahaja yoga is spreading very fast now. In Nigeria I was surprised how things are working out. Anywhere you go. People are now fed up of falsehood. In every religion I have found somehow they have created some falsehood and created groups. Because if you have the Truth you won’t be divided. So they created falsehood, some sort of a .and try to create these different, different groups and now these groups have become fanatics and they are fighting and killing. I mean killing is the only thing left in them. They have misinterpreted the Koran completely. There’s a book, a nice book by Javed Khan, the Koran Enlightened. Have you read it? I told him these are all wrong ideas. Now what they are saying that this Koran is Kundalini awakening. Now all of you have got it and he said it is not possible so what you have to do is to take this kind of religion that is against God. And that is what they are doing. But thank God I went to America and the war was over very fast and I told them the Divine. Their philosophy is
that we have to become pure. Those who become Mus-lims can be, otherwise those who are not Muslims should be killed. That is how they go on killing people. I hope they will understand there is Kundalini going on all over the world, and that’s how they can save themselves. They are
so fanatic and so power oriented that they didn’t realise. But it has shook the whole world. I must say, thank God now, the war is over. People have to suffer the after-effects of that war. So in Sahaja Yoga also we should not become fanatics. I have seen people even in Sahaja Yoga become very fa-natic. Fanaticism, we are against it. We are free people. We have Self-Realisation which is a birth by your Spirit and you are not bound by anything. You will never do
wrong things. All bad things will drop out automatically. You don’t have to be told, „Don’t do this, don’t do that.“ After some time I have seen all Sahaja Yogis become alright
and they come to their senses. Even those people who have left, I am sure, will come back, because, you see, af-ter all, there is Kundalini. She is sitting there, She’ll rise all the time. Correcting them. Many times, it will happen eve-rywhere. People come to Sahaja Yoga, after some time they will disappear, again come back.. But once they are there, they are there quite a lot. And that’s how Sahaja Yoga is growing. I am very happy to see that in Hong Kong, also, Sahaja Yoga is sustained by you and I am sure it will grow, espe-cially
in China. I am very happy. You have to do a lot for China and work it out. Because this is the message of Tao. This is not something, I would say, absolutely new. Only thing what I have done is to make it a mass organiza-tion, mass movement. That’s what it is. It is the same. All
these great Sufis, all these great Saints, incarnations, all of them have said the same thing, „Seek yourself, find your-self, know yourself.“ All of them have said the same thing. It’s nothing new I am saying. Only thing, I can work it out. That’s all. So it is something we have to work out, talk to people, tell them. I was surprised when we were coming by Cathay (airline) Avinash started talking to the air hostess and to other people. They all came to me one by one. They said you are a very powerful person, this, that. They all got their Self-Realisation. That’s how it’s going to spread. We have to tell everybody, tell everyone and not to feel shy about it. These guru people I have seen, they go on talk-ing about their gurus – who is a devil, maybe, anything. They go on talking. We should also talk and tell people about it. This is the Truth. You have to know the Truth. Talk. Of course there are people who have been criticis-ing – it’s all right, it’s all falsehood, it will all go away. I am very happy to see you all here. So thank you very
much again and again. (Presentation of flowers and thanks) You know the flowers you have put in my room have be-come big, very big, automatically. They know. In our garden in Cabella such a big pumpkin has come up. It’s 13 kilos. The whole village came to see it!

Thank you very much. Enjoy yourself. „(end of Talk)
