"The English are scholars", English Seminar, Sheffield (UK), 21 September 1985.

As I said yesterday, this is the field; field where the light has to come. With so many lights the field has to be enlightened. And this field which is enlightened is enriched by nature, too. And when you were singing I felt the clouds were catching the notes, weaving them within themselves and when it would rain, the rain will sing the song again; as if the valleys were resounding so beautifully. And the echo was very gentle and filling the whole atmosphere.

Perhaps you are not aware of the subtle of the Divine, how much It is anxious to work it out. But our trumpets and our flutes and our drums have to be alright. There has to be coordination, complete synchronising - then the melody is played in a beautiful way.

Clouds only carry the purest water, the purest hymns. So, when we are spreading the message, we have to understand that it has to come from a pure source. Purity is very important. I've already talked about chastity part, which is the Mooladhara, which is so important today; you can see it clearly how important it is. But that's not the end of it, that's just the beginning - just the beginning.

But what we have to see is something very innate built within us. And today as we are sitting in the heart of hearts that is Sheffield, where the steel is made - in the heart the steel, sometimes you need a part of steel also in the heart - we have to see where are we lacking, what's our basic problem. We should face it.

So as English we are, we have to think how our brains work, are used to work; how traditionally we have been brought to problems. When we see around how we have accepted some things which were very absurd and nonsensical, say in America or in France and other places, as if we have no personality of our own.

What did we give to others? What is the impression people carry about the British? Hippies? Or what do you call these days modern? The Punks? What is it that we have to give? Is an honourable image, is an honourable image of the British, of the English. We have to be honoured. We have to be honourable people. And we must keep our honour. And honour cannot come or cannot be expressed if we are people who are cunning. That's very superficial, anybody can find out, if we have that cunning within us.

Now it has been a character [which] can be very cunning. That’s what I discussed this morning. Be careful on that. Be careful. That's a trick of the ego. Don't fall a prey to that. And that then works out in our languages also.

Now English language is a specially honoured language now because it is the language of the Sahaja Yoga as well. Of course, we use Hindi, Marathi and then English. But English is the language in which my speeches are, so it should be honoured.

We must have a sense of honour that comes by respecting. When you respect yourself, you respect others. If you do not respect yourself you cannot respect others. And that's what I have discovered that, when people took to anti-culture and all sorts of things the first thing they did was not to respect anything whatsoever.

And yesterday, only, I discovered that the language which is spoilt has come through this. It’s fashionable to speak with a funny accent. And I was copying that the Americans speak like a duck - quack, quack, quack but the English speak like a crow - caw, caw, caw. And we have [a] real English language problem.

Just now Nick's wife told me that she can't understand what English speak. I said, “Same here, I don't understand either.” It's a language problem. One gentleman who came from India, very well educated gentleman, did his MA in English, he came back and he said, “I had a language problem there.” I said, “Why?” He said, “They speak all kinds [of slang]. They divert it every way and educated people talk like that!” And was surprised that it has also come from anti-culture [that] it’s a fashion to speak like that. And I can't follow [the meaning]. That means it is anti-God.

So, you must respect your language. You might be acquiring it from a hippie stage or you might be getting it even from Cambridge or from Oxford or from public schools. Whatever it is, whatever may be the source, either it is aggression on the language or no respect to the language.

So, in language, in speaking the language, try to speak straightforward English language. Because we are international people. We are not English anymore. We are grown to be global people now. We have a global personality and as global people we have to speak a language which everybody can understand. We cannot speak cockneyed (slang) language. I mean in India also we have lots of cockneyed but Sahaja Yogis don't speak that language. You won't understand that cockneyed language that we speak even if you are an expert on any Indian language.

So, first of all, you must show respect of your own language more than anything else. If you cannot respect your country, your language, your literature, your sublime things that are here, your buildings, how can you respect anything else? This is your soil which is not to be aggressed this way. That doesn't mean we become nationalists. I did not mean that. But to grow out as a tree you have to know your soil and you have to respect and be honourable.

Where is that English honour which I used to hear about? Is [it] lost in the thin air somewhere? An honourable person will not keep back taxes, will not ill-treat his wife, will not ill-treat her husband, will not talk rudely to them, would be respectable, will respect the children. First thing is that he respects everybody's freedom. If he's mean then he's not honourable. If he's not generous then he is not honourable. If he disobeys the law he's not honourable either. Why should we disobey the law? I just don't understand. Actually English laws are meant for angels I tell you - horrible! But in that only the devils take advantage. Doesn't matter, [the] laws are very good no doubt. But why should we break the laws unnecessarily? If it is necessary, alright. But for every small thing if you start breaking the laws then we start breaking the laws of the Divine also.

So we have to learn all these things. Let us be in an honourable way, accept things which are good but not fashionable. Now it is fashionable to be like this; it is fashionable to be like that. Now what I feel that fashion only is accepted by people who have no personality at all.

Tomorrow [if] somebody starts saying that, “You put a empty tin of jam on your head,” supposing if they say so: “You’ll look taller,” or something like that. I mean maybe a little. Or, “Let the jam fall on your face!” Any clownish nonsense we accept so easily. It's all clownish. And clowns are the only ones who copy like this because they have to amuse people by clowning. But are we to become clowns now? So by this kind of diffidence in our character - that we try to copy others without understanding what they are doing - we are becoming clowns. I mean you can see many like that.

So the clownishness is now one of the characters of the British. They really sometimes appear to me like clowns, because they try to copy others and whenever you try to copy others you are not the other. Like we try to copy, for example, Americans - very difficult; because they are so childish and stupid that we can't do that [copying] too good. I have seen a film of some Americans - I hope there are no Americans sitting here - where they had about a hundred people, actors and actresses above seventy or eighty years of age all shaking and they were all wearing funny dresses halfway missing, or this way missing, all sorts of things missing; less clothes than normal. And they were doing funny dances, all walking with sticks and doing [a] shake; or they were shaking already.

Now for English they love to use their umbrellas I think. So they’ll look clownish because you don't carry sticks, you carry umbrellas. So trying to do something that is American would be stupid. There's no need to copy them even outside; then why inside?

When you are a global personality as, in the nature, you can see [that] a mango tree looks like a mango tree. It doesn't try to become like an apple tree does it? And then that mango, when it is ripe, goes to the whole world. Whatever is the best mango you can find it in Russia, you can find it in America, you can find it all over. That's how it becomes a global personality. But mango remains a mango; it is not an apple. Who is going to import apples from India? In England that would be stupid.

So the personality that you are already - you are a British personality, or English personality or an Irish personality, or whatever personality you are - should be such [that] it’s presentable to others to be cherished, to be enjoyed. How is it possible? You have to be excellent, first class, top personality. So this clownishness must be given up. And it has come so much in England that I feel the heart is absolutely oppressed by these stupid things.

But there are certain nonsensical things which have come within us which we should give up, as I said first of all - the cunningness. Then in our language there should be straightforward expression. No sarcasm. There's no intelligence in sarcasm. Saying something nice to others is a great art. Have we developed that art of saying something nice to others? This art is to be developed by Sahaja Yogis: how to say something sweet and nice to others.

If you can develop the gentle method of saying nice things then later on you will see you will be able to do nice things for others - little, little things here and there. Like the little girl bringing beautiful pink flowers one after another. You are nice to me no doubt; but to each other? And to others who come to us? So how to say nice things, what to say, when to say - this we must learn so [that] we can establish communication. Self-consciousness [or] self-opinionatedness can never give you that. “I don't care! Alright let him be angry. So what do I care?” [is a] very common expression. But if you say to the person, “Why are you angry? I do care when you are angry. What's the problem? Can I not help you there?” - finished. He'll say, “What sort of a angel I am meeting here?”

Like yesterday the fellow was very aggressive and he asked me about heaven and hell and all that and I was least bothered - he was neutralised.

You must learn, this is an art which one has to learn. Don't be proud of your harsh tongues and your hot tempers. Don't be proud. “I am angry with him, so what?” Is it a very good thing to be angry with others? “I got very angry!” With very great pride they will tell me.  “I got very angry for that!” Why? As Christ has said, only one anger is allowed: if somebody says something against your Mother. That He's not going to tolerate! But that, too, controlled. Yesterday many were angry but it was alright: I know how to manage things.

So we have to learn also to tell ourselves: Let us not be so self-opinionated. We have to learn a lot. There is so much to be seen, so much to be learnt, so much to be understood; outside also. Like British are absolutely insular by temperament. Another matching with them are Japanese - equal type. Japanese also don't talk much but don't absorb anything whatsoever. You can imagine three hundred years English were in India, they learnt nothing! Can you imagine? Can you believe it? Three hundred years! Generations! Seven [or] eight generations they were in India. While here, when the Indians come, they too have no personality. They pick up your dresses, they pick up your language, they pick up everything; they talk with the same slang and hundred times they'll say dirty words in it and they'll say, “Yes man,” “No man,” “What man?” - to a woman also! ‘Unisex’. They have too much absorption! They absorb everything while you don't absorb anything. So these are two extreme cases I think.

So as it is said in Sanskrit that: what is the difference between the swan, hamsa, and the crane? So what is the difference between the crane and the swan? So when they have to discriminate between water and milk then you can find out who is the crane and who is the swan. “Nirak shira vivek e tu”. ‘Vivek’ is proper decision (discrimination). So if you put water mixed with milk before a swan, the swan will just suck in the milk and the crane will suck the whole, he wouldn't know. So that is what - again we come to the same point  - is discretion that we have to develop.

So it is the discretion part. That we have to pick up all that is good, all that is nice, from everywhere; and which is such a lot, such a lot. Like I would say, what's nice about British? Let's see.

Can you tell Me,  who is going to tell Me that?

Sahaja Yogi: They have a great deal of tolerance.

Shri Mataji: What did he say? Tolerance. No, no, not at all. It has to be a common quality, whether you are a Sahaja Yogi or not. Tolerance is the least, that's something lacking.

Sahaja Yogi: They're good leaders Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: You think so? (laughter)

Sahaja Yogi: Fair play.

Shri Mataji: Fair play I don't know now. That might have been. They were not very fair with Indians, were they? They were not very fair with Chinese, never. Still go further.

Sahaja Yogi: They’re good at talking about the weather. (laughter)

Shri Mataji: That would be bad weather. (laughing)

Yes, I mean superficiality, but that's not a good thing.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, they have very sharp minds.

Shri Mataji: Sharp what? Sharp minds.

Sahaja Yogi: Intelligence.

Shri Mataji: You're near, but not there.

Sahaja Yogini: Inventive.

Shri Mataji: Not so much, Americans are better.

Sahaja Yogi: Subtle.

Shri Mataji: Subtle. I wouldn't say that. Not that, not so much.

Sahaja Yogi: They want to help others.

Shri Mataji: Seldom! (laughter)

Sahaja Yogi: Manipulative

Shri Mataji: That's bad.

Sahaja Yogini: Loyal, Mother. Loyal.

Shri Mataji: Loyal? They create disloyalties, problems. They make people fight.

Sahaja Yogini: Once they find something good Mother they will stick onto it.

Shri Mataji: I wish they could! I wish they could, but the way they disappeared, every time we had programmes after that what I find everything disappeared.

Sticking on quality is missing.

Now is alright everybody has said? I wish you had all those qualities. You could. Why not? So all the qualities that are desired have been expressed. But what really are? Should I tell you?

Scholarship. Scholarship. Sahaja Yoga? Read everything. Sahaja Yoga means Kundalini, means this, that, go to the library, find out everything. Just know it. Scholarship. That's their quality. And this has to spread all over.

Do you agree there?

The scholarship in Sahaja Yoga has to spread all over the world. The women especially want to compete with men here. Very difficult, English women, not easy. Not all, but some. They should become scholars of Sahaja Yoga. I am surprised [that] people like Derek [Lee] or people like Hesta [Spiro] could not see the point.

Scholarship is the thing and that's why they're honoured everywhere [because] they are scholars. And see now, heart becoming a scholar. That's the integration of the brain and the heart.

We have so many scholars of Sahaja Yoga in England. We might get one there and one here and there. Like we can say in Switzerland you’ve got Gregoire and Arneau, but [in] scholarship how many are there? And very deep scholarship. And that is what you have to develop more. Specially the ladies have to learn a lot. It’s knowledge. To understand all the intricacies, all the delicacies, and to work it out in that scholarly way, is the way you will really do greatest service to Sahaja Yoga.

And it’s such a honourable thing to be a scholar. And once you are a scholar, this knowledge [that] goes into your head goes to your heart also. Scholarship in every subject. Scholars are different from inventive people. They may know very little and can invent something, that's a different thing. But that doesn't mean you go and read Vivekananda and all that! That doesn't mean that! But you go in every library, every place and discover the Truth. Blake? A scholar! So many scholars in this country. Most of them were Realised-souls. In England we have the maximum number, in the West I'm saying, maximum number of scholars, who were Realised-souls. In such a small, little country like that.

In India of course we had saints who were scholars, saints who were not scholars. So the scholarship part is your responsibility. And like a scholar you have to be above many things. A scholar doesn't stoop down to nonsense; he doesn't take to a superficial thing. It's below his dignity to behave in a childish manner or to take to sex and all these nonsensical ideas.

But the basic quality [of scholarship] you have got which is something so great I feel. Because heart becoming a scholar is something very great. It's a balance, it's a real balance, and that's the steel, that is the steel of England, the scholarship. That's how a New Jerusalem has to be built in. Not the old one where they were only faithfuls just going down singing songs and hymns - nothing. But scholarship, the complete knowledge. They know everything about Kundalini, they know all about chakras, they know all details about it. And if you may please, your Mother has spoken in England the maximum number of lectures because there are scholars. So preserve that, develop that, then only you will have all other qualities which you have described just now.

But remember that you are yogis, but scholars in your subject. Take any subject that you are dealing with - even an ordinary thing, we can say. If you are a carpenter you must know everything about wood: what is this wood? From where it comes? What is it? What can be used for? What is the density of this wood? What is the chemical composition? Everything you must know about it. And this is what you have to give to other people of the world.

Once you start doing all this, you will give up all the malpractices which British have taken to. First of all they have, the worst of all, is to create problems between two persons - they are good at it. Like, now you see now in South Africa what they did? Create problem between one shade of black with another shade of black. Very clever! Now when this scholarship was perverted they were the ones who started this idea that the blacks are primitive. They are the ones who introduced this idea. The same scholarship used for bad purposes. Who gave these ideas were about four or five writers who said they were primitive. Very nice! Brand them as primitive. Because scholars after all can brand anything as anything.

So it is necessary for us to bring goodness. To bring benevolence in this world we must write benevolent things, write something idealistic, something higher, something hopeful, something which gives them a new dimension of understanding.

All the Sahaja Yogis must start writing. Ramdas Swami has said that, “Every day you must write something.” Write diaries, write novels, write articles. Do what you like: poems, poetry. All kinds of things you can do if you just know that you have to be yogi scholars; but not intellectuals. Intellectuals have the knowledge of others, but scholars build up their knowledge on the true knowledge of others. That's the difference between a scholar and an intellectual.  An intellectual has nothing of his own, he's a confused person and he doesn't want to say, because he's so frightened that if he says anything that, “This is what I think,” then people might say that he is a man of domination or something like that. You need not be a graduate, you need not be anything! But that quality is built within you; which is a very big thing and is very much connected.

Now in Sahaja Yoga, as you know, that the heart is surrounded by seven main auras and these come from the brain which is the seat. Now in the centre, at the brahmarandhra, we have got the Heart Chakra, alright? The heart is here and around it are all these auras, if you see, in the brain. In the same way they are surrounding the heart. So if you know about them, it will circulate, the knowledge will circulate; but circulate with love, without any aggressiveness, without any showing off, without any cunning, without any sarcasm, in a full, straightforward, loving manner.

But for that we have to remember that we have developed lots of antidotes in England. Like the words I have seen people use very common is, “That may be too much.” “It may be too much.” They are frightened. “One shouldn't say too much.” You should! When you say too much at least little bit will go into their heads. So you have to say too much. Say what you want. There should be exuberance, exuberance of your ideas, so that something goes into their heads. [So] they know that you are sincere, [that] you’re saying it sincerely, [that] you cannot contain within yourself. Emphatically you have to say things. That's what everybody did. All those who were great incarnations said it with such concern, with such force.

In the same way you have to say it, without any fear. “Oh that may be too much! Mother it was too much for him.” Let him be blasted! Doesn’t matter. Say everything that you have to say absolutely with full heart. But when people come to Sahaja Yoga, when they come for a workshop or something, we try to be the same party people, like in the party you see, “What will you have?” Then they will say, “Alright, let me think what did I have yesterday, so I'll have today this thing.” It's like a shopping going on.

No! You have to say, “We have this and please have it now, otherwise you won't have it! This is the time!” Let them say what they like. It’s important.

I see sometimes your SDP conferences and all this! The way they speak, they just blast you, I mean hammer in your head. And why should we not when this is the Truth? Why should we not tell them and talk to them in that manner? We think by being gentle - alright gentleness is different, but I mean to say by saying less than I see. Understatement is typical English statement. “That might be too much.” In Sahaja Yoga it is such a lot that how much are you going to pour out? It can never be too much so be careful on that. When you have to say it, say it in a very blasty way, doesn't matter. What are they going to do? They can't crucify me this time, can they? They dare not. Otherwise perfectly alright, nothing can touch me,  and even crucifixion cannot touch me,  you know that. So you better say what you have found out in a big way and tell them in a big way. Of course loving and gentle manner, but tell them. The concern should be there. Alright?

Now this is what it is, one has to understand, that there is nothing “Say little bit.” Then they think, “He is a shaky man!” But when they sing horrible songs on the mic (microphone), eating the mic - I call it ‘eating the mic music’. They go on aggressing on the mic and people go mad with it, they like it. I don't say you aggress, but don't say anything less. Understatement is not needed. There should not be not be any balancing in that.

Those people who will be appeased by that will not be good Sahaja Yogis, they cannot come in the Kingdom of God. We don't have to be begging of them but we have to honour them, we have to respect them, we have to be kind to them. But we have to give them what we have. Like in the family you go, you get everything from the fridge and give it to them, they'll be very happy - take it whatever you like. “What a spread!” But if you put one little fish and two eggs for ten people, with one chilli to say that it is Sahaja Yoga (laughter) maybe a lemon, they will think, “What's this going on here? Wishy-washy stuff!”

Now that's one thing. Secondly there are words that people use very commonly: “That is very fussy!” That shows your fears. In Sahaja Yoga nothing is fussy, nothing is fussy. Always it is so. “It is very fussy!” It is, “This was fussy!” “That is fussy!” It is coming to such an extent that people now like [a] beggarish existence! They want to dress up like beggars: rustic, nonsensical things, worn-out clothes, worn-out faces.

I was telling Gavin the other day, “Why do you all like sand colour? There's no sand here. Is something Arabic in you that you like all sand everywhere?” As it is the hair are blonde, face is sand-like, clothes are sand! Mountains of sand walking around! (laughing) Why not be colourful? Why not wear colours? Sahaja Yogis must wear colours. Of course you should not be dandies! I must tell you that, otherwise you will be dandies; like wearing shocking pinks by men and [that] sort of thing. I don't mean that. But you shouldn't just go about with sand colour and a grey colour. If you start wearing something nice they will also produce.

I wanted to buy a sweater for Gavin in green colour. I couldn't get one light green. I said, “Let's have one. It will look nice.” No, couldn't get one for him; they don't make it - only sand! And I got it. Or else grey. Already the sky is grey, faces are grey, dresses are grey, they wear grey suits, the horses are grey, the world is around grey - all horrible. And then wear a grey dress to match with it!

So, there's nothing like fussy in Sahaja Yoga but you should not be childish, frivolous, stupid. And you should not be also dandyish, showing off; like I have seen people painting their car with gold and all that nonsense, or wearing a bow tie and a dinner jacket and walking on the streets of Oxford Street to match with these horrible ‘Hare Ramas' there, to make a contrast to them. That's not necessary.

On this also you could be scholars. You can find out.

About children, I'm very much worried now, much more since I heard about this three year old girl. And I have to say that your children are precious, they are wonderful people. In the beginning they have suffered because of you but they come out of it and they become so great. But you must learn one thing: is to be very attentive to your children. Don't neglect them! Teach them habits by which they do not learn things which will destroy them. Like every child picks up everything, puts it in the mouth.

We too here in England or anywhere in the West, people just put their fingers in the mouth like that they will go on. Anything they'll just - supposing they are opening a can. Now the can spills out some jam, so they put it in the fingers inside. No! That jam can might be having some germs. So anything that is to be put in the mouth you must wash.

That's now has to be the law for Sahaja Yogis, because so many germs, so many things, and for children specially they must be told, if anything falls on the ground. It's a very mundane thing but you must learn how we tell our children. Anything falls on the ground, immediately you'll pick up and throw away somewhere and wash our hands. We'll just say, “No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Not that.” Even from the mouth, if something falls out, you are not to pick up.

Unless and until you really fanatically do that your children cannot be saved from all kinds of infections that are around. India is full of parasites and we have many more. I mean we are the country where we breed and look after them and cherish them I think! All kinds of parasites we have had, politically also many parasites on us. But, [when it’s] all said and done, we know how to keep out of them and that's how we have to really condition our children.

Secondly: never to leave your child alone anywhere! Learn a lesson! At any cost you should not leave the child alone. You can leave it with somebody who can look after the child, who can run a creche, who can do something of that kind. But pay attention to this point that there should be no loneliness for a child. Child must be made to sleep in your room, maybe another cot, maybe crib. When slightly grown up, still should be with you. If there's a grown-up [or] another child, you can make, or some aunt or somebody sleeping with. But don't make children feel that they are lonely. Psychologically it will affect [them]. And also physically there could be a problem. We never, never, never allow our children to be alone - do you know that? In India.

I mean we are ourselves surprised how the children just go out. Now supposing some child, say about five year old says, “I am going to a candy shop,” - nothing doing. Mother will say, “Alright, when I go you will buy it, candy.” I mean when my daughters were not married, till then, they never went out alone. Can you believe it? Never! Even to school if they were going they were in the car with the driver. Even if they were going to colleges they were going in the car with the driver. Never alone. And if they were going by buses or anything, later on, when they went to higher education, they were going with friends.

Safety of children has to be looked after in this negative atmosphere everywhere. We are very good because we have this challenge all the time, so we are very careful. And you people have to now be made more aware towards your children. But don't spoil them! You spoil your children too much. I know they are very joy-giving because they are Realised-souls. But tell them, “You are Realised-souls and you cannot be dishonourable!” But not at the time. I have seen that you correct your children when they'll misbehave, “Don't do that!” That's not the way. Then you dishonour. You sit down with them, have a conference. “We'll have a conference now,” you tell them. “We'll sit down.” So let them feel, let them sit on their chairs like a conference hall and tell them, “Now see, we are all Sahaja Yogis. You are Sahaja Yogis, too, and the whole world is watching you. You have to be honourable children. You have to behave yourself, you have to do this way. We have to share our things. Otherwise they will say you are not Sahaja Yogi! You have to have dignity.” You talk to them, develop their personality that way so that they know they have to be majestic, they have to be regal. They cannot be cheapish like others.

Because all the time we say, “Don't touch that! Don’t do that!” They don't know, they are confused. Talk to them, sit down. Talk to them [about] what is to be done, how we have to behave, how to say nice things, how to help others, how to share your things, how to give your toys, how to keep your things, how to be neat, how to be tidy.

It's a training, that's what you have to do. And children also learn from your own behaviour. Now you tell your children not to drink and if you drink like a fish then how will they listen to you? In the same way, in Sahaja Yoga also, you do not meditate, you are not disciplined, you live in a very untidy manner, you are extremely careless, you do not honour people, your tongue is very loose, or you are very sharp - children pick up. They absorb these things so quickly. It's amazing how children absorb. Once I had taken a child to a circus just - he was a very good child, a Realised-soul. We went there and the joker, you see, he took out his upper pant just while going on a swing. So it was a big feat; a joker. So we came home, he also took out his pant! I said, “Why?” He said, “In the circus how he did I'm going to do the same way!” Imagine! That’s the only thing he picked up. I said, “But that was a joker, you are not a joker are you?” “No I'm not.” “And better wear your pant.”

So children pick up wrong things because it’s easy to pick up that; so don't do anything wrong. Another is husband [and] wife should never quarrel in the presence of children. If you want to quarrel I can even lend you some sticks, you can fight! Fight in your bedrooms. Do what you like. You can break the heads or break the hearts or do what you like but outside your rooms you are wonderful husband and wife. At least let your children be good, enjoying husband and wife. Actually it is stupid to fight because you must learn how to enjoy each other.

So we come from scholarship to the scholarship about children. Some people have to take it up seriously. Of course, there is a little book which Luis has nicely done up but is not sufficient. Some three, four people have to sit down - or some ladies could do it with some doctor there or something. Sit down with the full compiling of the ideas of Sahaja Yoga about children. Another one can do the education because [otherwise] Sahaja Yoga will be boring for you. What will you do? There’s so much to be done about the education of the children. It’s very important because every time I go to a place, there's a school being started, “What have we to do for the school? How are we to conduct?” Now why not you people make some research and give me the ideas and I'll put it through? I am good at correcting than creating, I think, nowadays. Because so much I have created. Whatever I have created is to be rearranged and consolidated. So I can consolidate whatever you give me,  I can consolidate, I can put right, I can correct it.

So best thing is now to form a committee for this. One for children, one for a book on children, on Sahaja Yoga. What Mother has to say about [it]. You can use my quotations. Then a book about the education of children. Third book has to be about the married life. That's how you can go on compiling, about the social life, about the politics, has to come from England - the series. So much [is] to be done in England, because people read that. It can be always translated from one to another. It’s very easy. So I would request you all to put your mind to this, whatever are your interests you should work it out. And put it in the language of Sahaja Yoga. Every sort - sports, you can take to gardening, or anything, even machinery - bring it to the level of Sahaja Yoga. Like computer, now all the developing countries want to develop computers. Now we must find out what are the problems of computerisation, then how it is going to affect socially, deeply, in the future, what can happen if we just develop computers and nothing else; how if it is one-sided movement then how the whole suffers. Like that a new dimension, a new all-pervading solution of everything can be done. And that can be a quite a big eye-opener to people who do not want to commit the same mistakes that you have committed.

I must say this ‘Affluent Society’ and all these books that [John Kenneth] Galbraith wrote was very helpful to some people, and that's how it should be.

So you can guide people who want to be like you and you can guide the people who are like you and who have to change. It should be your idea.

Drama: what's wrong with our drama, what's wrong with that and how we can improve it. Every one of you is capable of contributing something like that.

So those who are interested in different, various type of things, in this seminar, you can decide what one likes and what another thing - like even racial discrimination we can take a subject like that. Somebody can work it out: why racial discrimination has come, what are the bad effects of racial discrimination? If it comes from English, they will say, “What generous, good people there are, how they understand the feelings and how they...” That will be very soothing if it comes on the other side.

Then now we have a problem of women asking for their rights and all that what you call feminist movement: what is wrong with the feminist movement, how they have gone wrong, and all those things.

In every subject, even in economics and everything, you can go forward with the scholarly ideas. You can take help from other countries also . We have scholars everywhere. But we have maximum number of scholars here. And this is what we have to do in this land of She-field.

May God bless you all.

Should we meditate for about say, ten minutes? Will be a good idea; just to meditate and to find out what chakras are catching, to find out what side is weak.

Now if your Left Side is weak, put your left hand towards me and right hand towards the Mother Earth. If the Right Side is weak you put the right hand towards me and the left hand up there. Now if both are alright, when they normalise, you put both of them towards me,  alright?

For example, now you can tell because you are in East End (of London), what's the problem of East End is - survey it. You should find out the problems of East End.

I remember you told me about some Sikhs, what they were doing, drinking so much and doing all these things which is against Nanak Sahib. And all these things if you tell, the way they run after white skin. Yes! That's what it is.

So face-to-face let us see what is wrong with us. What is wrong with you? With what is wrong with others? Let us see. As a witness, not identified with anything. So if you tell all those things, what makes people that way, you go into it from both the sides, and you can give real good solutions; you can give solutions. For example there are doctors who can make a book with the Divine Knowledge related to the medicine. There are psychologists, they can make a book - I think Rustom has done a good job. I don't know.

Now by the way I must ask - who has got Rustom's book?

You have got?

Derek you have?

Derek Lee: No I haven't, Mother. I haven't seen it.

Shri Mataji: Somebody who is not here may be having. Who else? Ask Maureen, is she here?

Yogi: No Mother. She’s in London Mother.

Shri Mataji: Maureen? She's not here? Ask her maybe. Do you think Maureen may be having?

Yogi: I don’t think she has.

Shri Mataji: No? I just don't understand. I think you better see in your office maybe, Gavin. Just have a look. No? Because I gave it to someone, because it's not there in the house, can't find it. We had found his book, isn't it? No.

Alright, he's a scholar, no doubt. And I wanted Derek, you, to read that because really, it's really dynamic. ‘Dynamic’ is the word for that. It can blast all the Jungians and all the psychologists together! I must find it out. Otherwise somebody should write to him that God knows where it is Mother is very anxious about it. I must publish that book.

So now if you come out with sensible good books authentic, worked out. You have to work for a book. You cannot just write anything off hand. Like “William Blake and Sahaja Yoga”. Related to Sahaja Yoga. Now before meditation any questions, is there? Did you ask any questions there? No one? Any question? Yes, what is it?

Luis Garrido: Shri Mataji when I used to transcribe some of your speeches sometimes I didn’t know if someone was already transcribing that speech. We were wondering if there could be some kind of organisation by which we could know if some speech was already transcribed or not or if somebody was already doing it.

Shri Mataji: It's so fast that it's like Portuguese to me! (Luis is Portuguese)  Can you tell me Gavin?

Gavin Brown: He is saying there should be some organisation by which it's known whether any particular one of your speeches is being or has been transcribed, so that there's no duplication.

Shri Mataji: There's no...?

Gavin Brown: Duplication of effort. Because he wants for Your speeches to be transcribed from the tapes and he doesn't want to do one and it's already been transcribed.

Shri Mataji: Are you doing some... you're transcribing.

Luis Garrido: Not at the moment Shri Mataji. I used to worry - every time Shri Mataji has a very nice speech sometimes I just felt like transcribing it but I was worried maybe someone is doing it already.

Shri Mataji: What's it?

Gavin Brown: He's worried that if he does the transcription, somebody else may also do it so it would be a wasted effort.

Shri Mataji: Agreed. Now who are transcribing - they form a group. You are transcribing? Who else?

Will you stand up? You also stand up Luis. Now you know each other don't you?

Douglas Fry: Mother I'm quite prepared to take a list because I've got a computer.

Shri Mataji: What is it?

Gavin Brown: He’s saying he can make the list on his computer.

Shri Mataji: Yes I think amongst these four who are transcribing. Alright? You decide among yourselves.

Warren: But there are many more internationally Shri Mataji and it should be advised to all centres.

Shri Mataji: You see in other languages, which are being translated.

Warren: Even in English Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Like Australia, whatever I have said there in Australia they should transcribe. But what I have said in England they should.

In every country whatever I've said should be transcribed by that country, is better to make it systematic. Alright? Is alright now?

So four of you here should transcribe whatever I have said in England, which is going to be a hard task! Some more people should raise their hands who would like to do transcribing.

Please stand up.

Derek And Luis, you take down their names. Take down their names. You give your names. Write in on a chit of paper. And now you form a group and tell them how to transcribe.

What else? First of all you must understand my Indian English, otherwise you can’t. Or they call it King's English, I don't know why but they say so.

Shri Mataji: How are you?

Yogi: Getting better I hope Mother.

Shri Mataji: That's good you look better. Thank you. May God bless you.

What is the next? It's very, very constructive.

Now editing: once you have transcribed somebody has to edit it also. Not like Indians - when I speak I say sometimes, “You see,” “Do you understand?" All these things need not be there but they think that nothing should be missed of Mother. But I would say that something is needed. I mean, you cannot go on just adding these things after all. So we can remove some of these things, this type of pauses that I have used. Because talking is different from writing. But in any case when you do it I'll have to go through them before we publish them. But so many lectures of mine have duplicates, repetitions.

So once you have done [the] transcription then we can see that, we can adjust. Sometimes certain things are to be said once, sometimes twice, and sometimes hundred and eight times. For example, “I am not guilty.”

Alright. So any other thing?

This was very constructive I must say. Yes?

Yogini: Mother in one of the Nirmala Yogas there's a little diagram which you have drawn of the Kundalini coming up through the chakras and going round two circles and then coming up to the next one. I can't find from it if the Kundalini is coming up and going round and then continuing up the same side or if it's crossing over at each junction. Supposing I am doing the right side, is it coming up and going round and continuing up the right side every time, or does it come up the right side, go round twice and go to the left, go round and come up.

Shri Mataji: No it goes in a spiral way and cuts it at a point, and makes a chakra. You see it's a sympathetic nervous system which is left and right and it goes in a spiral. And it cuts it at a point because it goes in a spiral - that’s the chakra.

But I think we have done that in one of the speeches; it’s so. Once this is transcribed that will be a source. And then everything I have said, all these things, I have said it in very great details: you will have to locate it.

What else now?

Luis Garrido: Shri Mataji. What can we do with the water after washing Shri Mataji’s feet?

What is it? Just Gavin you tell Me?

Gavin Brown: He’s asking what is to be done with the water that is used in puja, afterwards? When we wash the feet, what use is to be made of the water or how is it to be disposed? Say at home when we do a little puja and we just wash your feet in the photograph, then what's the proper way to dispose of it?

Shri Mataji: The photograph or feet? Photograph, that becomes vibrated water. You can use [it] for any purpose, you can put it for trees, you can do all these things external use, you can use for anything. But if you have cleaned the photograph and all that and if it is a clean photograph then you can use it for drinking also, is alright; can be used for drinking also. Because vibrations are such that they kill all germs, everything. Because now for Ganges water we just drink like that, no problem. It never gets spoilt. You keep it for months together never gets spoilt. Because falling from the head of Shiva never gets spoiled. That's the sign of the River Ganges.

Yogi: What about fasting Mother?

Gavin Brown: He's asking what is Your advice about fasting?

Shri Mataji: No, you can fast but not in the name of God. If you want to fast, you can fast but not in the name of God. God doesn't want you to fast. Nor does He want you to eat like a glutton but He wants you to enjoy the food, whatever He has given you. You should pray over the thing, you should give vibrations to your food and enjoy. God has given you everything and you should eat what is needed for you. But you should not starve, you should not fast in the name of God. Don't torture yourself in the name of God. That's very anti-God activity, I think. Like poor fellow yesterday that Vivekananda tortured him, imagine? He's gone through all that for four years! It’s too much. It makes me really very sad that people are tortured in the name of God.

Yogi: Should there be a magazine with all the poems Mother?

Shri Mataji: Yes, we have a magazine?

Yogi: Or are you saying, “Could we have one?”

Shri Mataji: With the poems? Only thing I'll say, poems are to be very much still to be put right. A magazine for Sahaja Yogis is alright, but if you have to put it out, then they have to be little bit, brought up-to-date in the sense that they have to be more edited, and one has to work on them. And the poems should be brought out as magazines but they have to go through proper understanding and things. You know, sometimes people write funny, funny types of poems also. Like somebody will say, “Sahaja Yoga is my rice and Sahaja Yoga is my daal, and Sahaja Yoga is my meat and Sahaja Yoga is my fish.” And I said, “Next would be -  ‘and Mataji is my food.’!” You see they mean that it (Sahaja Yoga) is everything, but the way they express is sometimes really crude. Yes! There was a poem like that I tell you. (laughter) And I got a fright of my life!

So, I would say that one has to be little careful. There are two things always in expression. First is creativity, of course. You have to be a creative person. But you must have the technique. If you don't have the technique then this creativity looks bizarre. So even if you have ideas, very poetic ideas, you must have the technique of putting it in. Prose poetry can be also very beautiful but you must know the technique, you must know the way how to put it across. Like you may be a great artist as a creative artist but you must know how to put technically. Supposing I am a great artist but I don't know how to handle a brush, how will I do it? So both things have to be there. And that's what I think, that because of Sahaja Yoga people are getting very creative and they are feeling the exuberance and they want to express themselves but the technique part of it is lacking, and the subtleties are lacking.

So whatever poems you are writing is very good idea, like some of them are very good, but still I think there should not be any crudeness in it, alright? So, all those who are writing poems, who would like to write, stand up.

So nice to see so many poets around! (laughter)

Alright so now, who will look after? You? Alright. That’s it. You all know them. Give your names to him and send all your poems to him. Alright? That's it. There should be nothing childish, cheapish or anything like that.

Then for art, all those who want to produce pictures and paintings, drawings, please stand up; even the children. Chris, you're going to do that? Good, and your wife too, she's very good.

So let's have Chris there. Chris will you be in charge?

Please be seated.

So it comes to that we have also two types of people. We have people who are intellectuals - ‘easy chair’ Sahaja Yogis - as we have politicians. They’re good at knowledge, scholarship, they know about Sahaja Yoga; they write well. But there are others who are active, very active - the young - extremely active, they can work hard, they can do anything. That's a very good thing, but I think we should try to imbibe one quality that is lacking in us. Like a person who is an intellectual, or a person who is a scholar, should try to do other things also - like postering now. So for postering they will not go - those who are intellectuals. That's not good. Or anything like that. Those who are painting, they'll paint but not poster it. Or they would not like to write the addresses.

We should be able to do everything because we are integrated personalities. I mean I can give lectures, I can cook food and I can wash utensils and I can clean my house. I can wash your clothes and whatever you say. Perhaps may be something I may not be able to do I should say (laughter); many things. I tell you so many things I can't do. You don't know my weaknesses, there are lots of things. I'm very bad at signing cheques! (laughter) Useless for banks. Always the banks put me into trouble. I don't know what they're up to. And thank God Gavin is quite aware of my weaknesses, so he looks after that part otherwise I would be sunk! Bad at money, very good at remembering if somebody has taken money from me,  but if I have given something to someone I don't remember, very bad. I give something to someone and then I don't remember I have given it and I appreciate it - it's very bad too. I do it very often. I'm so frightened now I don't want to praise anything because mostly it is given by me - it's horrid. It looks very funny isn't it? (laughter)

That's one side missing completely in me.  I'm very bad at say passports and things like that and  also I don't know about ticketing - all these things. I’m very bad at all these things.

So that's how you look after me in that part because really I just don't know. I'm very bad at time: now I don't know what's the time now. Very bad at watch, it's always upside down! (laughter) But there's one thing good: that I know myself very well, and I know how to laugh at myself so I never feel guilty. I know how to laugh at myself. I can't learn these things now. I have learnt lots of human things but now I can't learn how to sign a cheque, where to sign, what to sign. I'm very bad. You can get signature on my death warrant also. See I'm like that. I don't know I just sign, I trust and it works out. So far nothing has gone wrong as such; much! But this is what it is. So it doesn't matter. One can manage. And that is how one should look at oneself. Not to feel guilty but some things are missing.

But if you can acquire other qualities also it will be a good idea. And that's what I think should be the attitude towards Sahaja Yoga: that no work is below our dignity. For some people have such ego, “Oh I'm coming there why not I have a room?” Such stupid people have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga, I tell you. “I must have a special room!” “Why shouldn't I have this?” This is absolute sign of a stupid fellow; is absolutely a sign of a person who has never known what is comfort, never known what is money, never known what is luxury. It’s something cheapish like a beggar who just starts demanding, “Give me five shillings!” then he asks for one hundred shillings and this and that. All these things - the one who asks for things is not a king. The one who accepts whatever comes their way is the real king because he's mastered it. This is what is the right attitude. That's what a Sahaja Yogi has to be. [The one] who goes on grudging, grumbling about small, small things is not a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja Yogi is a king: he gives, gives Realisation, the utmost, the highest.

Alright?

What's it?

Shakuntala Kerswell: (speaks in Marathi)

Shri Mataji: (Replies in Marathi)

She’s giving a very subtle point about puja, that when we are doing the puja, say of the photograph also, then we should have all these things like a kalasha and all those things there, we should not just do the puja of the thing - pratibha. So I've said. “You have come here all the way over here to tell them these things. They don't know.” So all the deepam and all these things should be there, properly done; for the photograph also, that's in the protocol. So certain things of protocol...now Gavin is becoming a big pundit you know! He's getting a scholarship in puja business. (laughter) So you better talk to Gavin, those who have problems about puja, better ask Gavin.

Gavin Brown: Mother I was going to ask those who know something about Puja should come and tell me.

Shri Mataji: Alright some of you should... they have to tell something you better go and tell him also. Yes, good idea.

Chaya has not come today? No. She has told a lot. Then now she has come, Shakuntala is here then we have got this lady. We have so many who can tell you about this and we can work it out.

That's good. So scholarship of puja. And those who want to do puja now, stand up. But that's too much. To know about puja. Alright? Good idea. You ask Gavin.

We should really have about different marriages, how we perform, what are the mantras, what does it mean, all those things: I think we should really compile a book on that, good idea. All of you should support. Give your ideas, alright?

Thank you.

I mean in the sense you ask a question, “What should be done?” “What is to be done?” “What is good?” So that he works on that and we find out a common point. Alright?

May God bless you.

Sit down, sit down. Any other aspect. Yes?

Yogi: Shri Mataji, I was wondering what was going to happening about building work in Sahaja Yoga. Sometime ago we discussed Golden Builders.

Shri Mataji: You have it. You are a registered society, aren't you? Have you registered yourself as “Golden Builders”? Alright, all those who are interested in buildings and decoration and maintenance, please stand up. Vicky [Halperin] what do you build?

Victoria Halperin: Mother, the decoration side, if that's suitable and can be integrated into the building, the decoration side. With your permission.

Shri Mataji: Really? Then better give your names to Vicky, all of you. Let's have it! Because also I gave a good advice to John. I told him, “Take photographs of my house and use it for advertising for saying that this is the house we have done. This is what we have done.” For example, you can do it by showing your film, in the way that, “I have taken the photograph.” “I have done this.” All that you see, and can use it as an advertising thing. So that's how you can carry album and say that we are working with Golden Builders.

Warren: One other area Shri Mataji, music.

Shri Mataji: Alright. For music please stand up. We don't have Bernard [Rackham] here. Is he here?

Bernard: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Alright. Because I have already asked him to do one thing. So will you look after?

Bernard Rackham: Yes Mother.

Shri Mataji: Alright? Can you all contact him. Whatever is to be done about music. Alright?

Please be seated.

Now there's another aspect is photography, photos. It should not be all filed. Remember what we have done.

Gavin you have to get all the names of the people. You should give to your leaders, all of you, whatever you have said it. Without hesitation I would like to see.

Now photography: those who take photographs, stand up! No, more. More people for photographs, and many more.

Gavin Brown: Those who have taken nice photographs of Mother stand up!

Shri Mataji: What are you saying?

Gavin Brown: “Those who have taken nice photographs of Mother stand up!” I thought more of them would stand up but some of them have sat down instead! (laughter)

Shri Mataji: Alright. Where is Don?

Vicky Halperin: He is making tea, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: He is making what?

Yogi:  A cup of tea for you Mother.

Shri Mataji: Oh. I see. So Don too. [Ray] Harris will look after that. Ray, you all should contact Ray. Give him your names. Alright?

Now. Legal side is very important. So, lawyers and connect administrators, just stand up. No we have here. What about you? You are a Custom Officer isn't it. Better stand up. Anybody police officer? Those who are dealing with government.

Yes, good. Alright, you look after that. Good! You know him or not? Alright.

Bill Hansel: Mother may I mention one thing? On the important side of perhaps purchasing property through Sahaja Yoga and maybe the benefits that could be obtained through use of the charity. We don't have any knowledge of that at the moment but in Birmingham at the moment, we have made some inquiries. I know [that] Ray from Derby, he deals with the legal side of many things connected with local government.

Shri Mataji: Can you stand up?

Bill Hansel: And he's been most helpful in sorting out our details referring to mortgages and so on for us, and has come up with certain information. But also we're anxious to know what benefits may be accrued by Sahaja Yogis if we can use a charity to do such things. It seems that there may be some financial benefits in it, and and if we can get together some information.

Shri Mataji: Alright. For this part I would say David Prole. Where is he? Stand up! Those who are interested in buying properties and charitable things and all that. Who are interested? Just get up. Where is Ian?

Gavin Brown: Mother we have got some details about covenanting from our accountant.

Shri Mataji: What? Details about?

Gavin Brown: Getting money on covenant. It's very much beneficial for tax purposes.

Shri Mataji: Alright. So David Prole is to be informed about whatever information you get. And to get from him all the information that is needed. And through him we'll deal in property problems. Alright?

So let us have a collective thing. All of you should give your names to him. And everyone who is now appointed as the person in charge should give us a full idea. Any problem with your properties should go to this committee. Alright?

Now, there's one more aspect which is the most important and the greatest headache: is marriages! (laughter) So this has to be somebody international and...You are in that photograph group, alright? Who is in charge of photographs? Ray Harris. Alright?

Yogini: Yes Mother

Shri Mataji: You contact him. Now make something positive, some plans positive, make it something. Let me know. There are photographs and photographs and you don't know where they are compiled, who has taken them, where are the copies - nothing. It's all just, everywhere. Alright?

So proper filing has to be done, proper understanding has to be done. For marriages Warren is the best I think. (laughter and applause)

Now Warren you should stand up! And now those who want to help in making marriages successful, in the sense - in advising people, in making them understand, talking to them, and also organising marriages, future marriages, of people - like a marriage bureau - those who would like to help. Some elderly people should come out for this. I would like to have. What do you think Magda? You have not stood [up] for anything. Come along! Pat [Prole]. Where's Pat? Who else? They should be happily married people, in a way. Yes, good, Sarah [Setchell]. Yes, good.

Gavin Brown: Hesta [Spiro] is outside also.

Shri Mataji: There are outside also? That's for children. They will be for children. Those who are outside will be for children.

Alright, so here they are. Now please send your names to him, today. All these names must be given today in this seminar. Alright?

Now for children, last and the most important. Call them. You are a teacher, isn't it? You are teaching in a school?

Yogini: I thought I would do a book Mother, on teaching ‘reading’.

Shri Mataji: But just now we are thinking of starting a school in Hounslow. But where do you live?

Yogini: I live in Hampstead Mother.

Shri Mataji: It's too far away.

Yogini: This is my last year before I retire.

Shri Mataji: Alright. Now how many of you who have children, small children, and [are] interested in them? Let's see. Now get up! All those parents who have small children. All those parents who have very small children. Get in please, get in!

I think David is the best for this. David, will you take over? Let David handle it. All of you should contact David about it. Now all of you should sit down and only David should stand so they should know.

You'll have to also deal with problem children. There are problem children. But we have to find out something where we can deal with problem children. And about that I'll talk to you. Those who have problem children please get up.

She's better, much better now. But what about you?

Mr. Nagaraj: Is deafness counted as a problem?

Shri Mataji: In a way, in a way it is, because it is to be treated. Alright? So, those who have problem children also must be dealt with. So you can have two things: where there are problem children and where there are not. If they are catching, if they are still not enjoying life, if they have little problems with them, or if they are catching from parents, all these things are to be dealt with.

So on this point I have to say one thing: when we have problem children it’s sometimes the fault of the parents also or may be some defect in them, or some sort of a wrong thing. Now, under these circumstances, we have to understand that it is the right approach of the parents can only help the children to get alright. So whatever is suggested to them and told to them, they are not to feel bad about it, but to accept it and correct their ways and methods and things will work out. Alright? So that's a promise. Nobody's going to feel bad about it [but] is going to take it up as a very good advice, whatever we have to tell them, so because we have to pay special attention to this. Especially with ladies I have seen - if you tell them anything, they start crying. It's a water power which I cannot overcome. (laughter) I don't cry so much do I? I don't know why people should cry so much and upset everybody. So such people will not be allowed to cry! If they have to correct their children, first thing [is that] they are not to cry and weep and sulk. Then only we can solve the problem. Alright? So, done. This is also done.

Alright, let the children go out. Because the children still are not peaceful. We can see that. They are very noisy. They are not normal. So you can take the children out. I think most of them are problem children. Because they cannot feel the vibrations!

You could feel, you see. Did you feel that when they came in, the heaviness? It was very sad. Those who were supposed to do great jobs are sick now. That's because of the parents. I think now I can go? Or what's the next programme?

Gavin Brown: Mother, this evening we wanted to sing something so we brought song books.

Shri Mataji: What's that? Can you hand it over to me.

Yogini: Would you like some lunch Mother?

Shri Mataji: What a very sweet thing you are. What a sweet thing. Thank you.

Yogini: Would you like some lunch Mother? We have prepared some for you.

Shri Mataji: Lunch?

Yogini: Some cottage cheese.

Shri Mataji: I don't know. Am I supposed to eat lunch? (laughter) That’s another thing missing. I have not had lunch so far, I think so. Alright?

So what song Gavin? Why not have “I'm Your Rakhi Brother”?

Warren: There's quite a big job to be done on taping.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Warren: Big job to be done on getting all Your tapes transferred onto permanent tapes. Did You want to appoint somebody to help Jamel with that?

Shri Mataji: Where is Jamel? I didn't see him.

Warren: He's coming in the afternoon. We need people who are technically...well, who are able to spare time each week to copy many of your old tapes.

Shri Mataji: Those who want to copy my old tapes and help, please stand up! Who know technical ways of doing it. But we have only one machine. Can we buy another?

Warren: The machinery is adequate, Mother. They've got enough machinery now.

Shri Mataji: Only one.

Yogi: Jamel is well set up for copying. It's the people we need.

Shri Mataji: You have to come, distribute among yourselves and (to Shakuntala) Marathi chi tumhi kara!  And there's no Hindi speaking people here? Chaya can do Hindi. They can go there to the ashram and do it.

So Ian is not going to be here permanently but Jamel. You must contact Jamel, offer your services to him and tell him that you would like to do that.

How many there are, who can spare? Derek you got up also. Can you come to the ashram sometimes?

Derek Lee: I've got copying facilities in Cambridge, Mother. They send me single tapes and I can copy twenty or forty at one time.

Shri Mataji: Alright. Some people who can spare a day.

Warren: One day each week. Come on, there should be a lot of people who can do it, in London, at Chelsham Road.

Shri Mataji: Will you give your names to Jamel? Some more people should come round. It's a tremendous task, you see.

Warren: All go back to 1974. They’re all deteriorating and Mother's tapes are going to be lost if we don't do it quickly. We also need to spend money on a digital recorder to make it permanent.

Shri Mataji: That's good. It's very important.

Warren: Ok so somebody take the names. Ian would you do it?

Children are in a bad shape Left Nahbi is catching: something wrong with the mothers.

Alright. Now what I'm saying, this is to be done when I am gone. All of you, should give your names. Remember! I hope you remember. Because you stood up and sat down, stood up and sat down, but now remember when you stood up, you see. One may forget.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, might I make a suggestion. All those people who feel that they could write articles in a magazine or newspaper: we could launch a full offensive in an attempt to get articles published.

Shri Mataji: Who is it?

Gavin Brown:  He's saying that there must be some people who would be prepared to write articles about Sahaja Yoga for publication in the magazines and newspapers, and that we should make an effort on that line.

Shri Mataji: Yes. That's one side of it. Newspaper cuttings and things now. I was thinking of John Noyce if he's here. I don't know. Are you? He's the one who should be in charge of that, John Noyce. Will you stand up? Now will you stand up all those who want to do that. Is compiling of all newspaper cuttings, from all over the world, compiling of all articles which are to be published. You mean to say in the magazines? What did he say?

Yogi: An editorial team to specifically filter all the articles that people are writing and then orientate them to different magazines and publications.

Shri Mataji: What did he say?

Gavin Brown: He's saying that people should start writing now, for publication and that it should all be edited and sent in.

Shri Mataji: Yes. That's it. But also we have newspaper cuttings everywhere which are to be put into one file and to be studied and marked. Yes.

Warren: That's one job which is very good for John to do. He's very good at that.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s what I said.

Warren: And another team with David perhaps.

Shri Mataji: Now. For David [Prole] is for property and all that we've given him one job, is sufficient to kill him! With one job. But you can join him in this, I mean in the sense you can belong to that party as well. So now those who want to compile all that is interviewed, all the newspapers, every cutting and also your own contributions, please stand up. This is not only writing but compiling. That's good. Valerie is good.

For example also we can say what we can do, how to have our pamphlets and brochures and these to be done; up to that point. Alright? That's one.

So we come to another very delicate thing - is contacts. Contacts with the television and other publicity things. Now whatever is our own publicity should be done by John Noyce but to contact others and all that? Valerie?

Ray Harris: May I nominate John Glover for that?

Shri Mataji: Oh, where is John Glover?

Ray Harris: I think he’s on his way up Mother. He had some trouble with his car.

Shri Mataji: No that's for something else. But I was thinking Valerie is better for this. Will you take over? You stand up.

Now those who want to go to the programmes, if we arrange some sort of a drama or we arrange anything for the television or publicity anywhere else outside, through other agencies, please stand up.

Good.

Yogi: Also Bogdan, Mr. Bogdan.

Shri Mataji: Bogdan. And John Noyce. I didn't see Bogdan, where is he?

Gavin Brown: I don’t think he’s arrived yet Mother.

Shri Mataji: Alright. So you be one of the parties with them. But the leader is Valerie. Alright? Please be seated.

But remember that you have promised all these things in my presence.

Practically we have covered lots of things. Let's see how much we achieve. So Paul [Winter] what are you in charge [of]? Computerisation of everything?

Paul Winter: Not at the moment, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Alright. You stand up for that. Now here is Paul.

Paul Winter: I’d like to say, Mother, that the equipment we make is selling very well in India. We're selling Marathi, Gujrati, Bengali, Tamil systems, everything.

Shri Mataji: So all that sort of typing, of computerising, Paul is in charge. Now those who want to help him in that, who are good at computerising, giving ideas on that please stand up. Alright. Who else? Jamel, also Jamel.

Good. So now please write down all their names in one paper.

Gavin Brown: Could Warren tell about Brian’s programme in New Zealand?

Shri Mataji: That you can tell later. Alright? Brian has done a good job. There's a series of seekers and actually in one of the programmes one boy gets Realisation in front of my photograph and they show my photograph on the television! But that is in Auckland, that is in New Zealand where we have a very great dynamic Prime Minister (David Lange). I think after Sadat, I feel, he is another person who is a Realised-soul. (Egyptian president Anwar el-Sadat).

I hope the Prime Minister here also gets Realisation or we get somebody who is a Realised-soul, one of the two. I hope she gets it. (laughter) Pray for it.

So can we go now? What's the lunchtime business?

Yogi: They want us to take lunch now actually.

Gavin Brown: You lunch is just coming, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Here? And nobody's going to eat now. I'm the only person who is going to eat?

Yogini: Lunch is ready now Mother for all of us.

Shri Mataji: All of us? Then it's alright. What's that Gavin? (Mother is looking at a large gift wrapped box)

Gavin Brown: It’s something from Sheffield we got you. It’s just a souvenir.

Shri Mataji: Just? (laughter) Thank you very much. That's quite heavy. Why? May God bless you. You can open it and show them. That's what they make here. And I mean there was no need but they said [that] I have to remember. I would in any case remember. But now that's their idea, what am I to do? Something that they make here. That's it.

(Gavin unwraps the gift which is a teapot and cup made in Sheffield of Sheffield silver.) See? Oh what a beautiful design. Is [made] in Sheffield?

Yogi: Yeah, it’s made in Sheffield.

Shri Mataji: It's a beautiful design, isn't it? It's better than what you showed me.  (laughter) (Gavin unwraps the milk jug) That’s the third one. Now we put it here. It's beautiful! And this I will see every day, morning. It's beautiful. Very beautiful design I must say. You know we copied this, we have got this design, we use it in Calcutta. Really! Believe me!  It's beautiful. I say, what a beauty. Four pieces you bought? It's beautiful. Look at that. (applause)

Thank you very much. Thank you.

I thank all the Sheffield Sahaja Yogis for such a beautiful gift and this I will have every day.

Thank you very much. May God bless you.

You better keep it back into the box I think, properly. It's beautiful, isn't it? You all can have a look. Let them see. The design is very nice and delicate. Who's got it? Warren, you did?

Warren: They got it.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: I got it with Jo, Mother, this morning.

Shri Mataji: No this I didn't see! The one I saw was, it has that design you know. That didn't have any design.

Warren: They couldn't get the one You wanted so this is the replacement. But this is cheaper.

Shri Mataji: Really? Sahaj! It's from the same shop!

It's such a beautiful thing. And also very sensibly sized you see. That one was a jumbo one. Alright.

So should we have some music? And, Gavin if you want I'll eat, otherwise I better go. I don't want to trouble you people because I had a meal.

Warren: It’s coming.

Gavin: It’s coming for Mother.

Shri Mataji: No because, why to bother?

Gavin: If you want me to ask if it’s ready, because it’s not, but  it will come.

Shri Mataji: Alright. So, let's have this one (bhajan). But what a nice thing eh? I want to see the design.

Yogi: Can everybody who knows [the song] ‘Rakhi brother’ come and stand in one corner.

Yogi: Warren’s just reminded me, I should have told you, that I used to work for the company, for three years, who make the silver! I used to, but I don’t anymore.

Shri Mataji: What’s that?

Yogi: I used to work for the company. It’s Parkin’s Silversmiths. It doesn’t say it there, but it’s made by a company called Parkin’s.

Shri Mataji: But what’s written here?

Yogi: ‘Silver plated. Sheffield, England’.

Shri Mataji: It’s Sheffield? It’s beautiful. It’s very beautifully done. You were working there? So!

Yogi: For three years.

Shri Mataji: It’s a good Idea. Alright.

(Yogis start singing the song)

Shri Mataji: Beautiful!

Now, your suggestions [for songs].

Yogi: Mother at the moment we don’t have any musical instruments, they’re all on cars outside.

Shri Mataji: Can you bring it? Alright.

Yogi: Or do you want to postpone it till this evening Mother?

Shri Mataji: Will you please go and get it? Yes, yes that's great. Just go. Those who have their instruments should go and get it.

Pat has come I think? He’s sitting outside? What's the matter? What are you doing there?

Pat Anslow: I was late Mother.

Shri Mataji: No! you better join our company. Take him in the builders [group] (Pat Anslow was a plumber).

Yah, yah. Tumhi bahar kai basle? (Marathi: Come in why are you sitting outside?) Mrs. Kuthet? (Where is your wife?)

Yogi: Ata Bahar et(Right now she’s outside)

Shri Mataji: Bolungya (Call her in)

Please get your musical instruments if they are outside.

The faces of Sahaja Yogis are so different you know! They look so different. Every one is a piece of art I think. So beautiful! What’s she saying?

Gavin: There's a new song written by Diane from Sheffield.

Shri Mataji: Really? Great. Let's hear. Well bring it along. Yes why not? From Sheffield we should have.

(Shakuntala Kerswell brings a poem that she has written for Mother)

She's written a Marathi poem. So I'll translate it to you. She says that, “My child who is a Sahaja Yogi is manifesting knowledge. I request you, everyone - that's me - request you all of you, that I am the mother of this child, and you pay attention to him.”

This is a typical, you see, an Indian, what we call a kautuk, is the one where you handle the child with fondness, you express the fondness for the child. Now she's describing the fondness for the child, I have. My little child ‘Sonula' they call it, is the golden child. my golden child speaks with such affection, sweet, child's talk. We can say - the beautiful talk of a child. You see ‘child’ here meaning ‘the innocence’. He speaks to you with innocence. And listening to him, your attention will enter inside. It will leave all that is outside and will enter inside.

And to tell... ‘Nirupana' la kai manaitza Marathit? (meaning: How to explain the Marathi word ‘nirupana’ ?) Nirupana. ‘Nirupan’ is ‘the explanation of the Divine’. But it goes with my word ‘Niru’. Niru is my name. So it's a pun on the word ‘Niru-pan'. ‘Pana' means the abstract of Niru. To talk about that. So there's a word. Nirupan has double word: it also means ‘to explain the abstract of Mother’; and ‘Nirupana' also means ‘explanation of Divine’.

“Oh God, give him the blessings, I say. He is also in this world living like a ordinary householder, as well as he has achieved a Sahaja samadhi.”

He’s achieved the Sahaja. ‘Samadhi’, as you know, is the enlightened awareness. But he lives in the world. He’s not given up anything.

“For the people who are ignorant he has taken the help of chaitanya.” He is...Tumza Marathi vyachar bahar ahe English chya (meaning follows); it goes beyond English. Barobar (OK) Let me try.

“Jinkita amrutaze jinkita payizya gyave Nirmala chi bol.” (Mother tranlates as follows) “You go on conquering, one after another challenge to the ambrose of Mother's talks. Take Her name and you can do it.”

It's very poetic.

“Nyana deepa doliyatze te zyalita te jovana” “In the eyes there's light, enlightened, and with that all the lights get enlightened, and the siddhapurushas, the ones who have achieved the siddhata, the ones who are very great, higher souls, have come on this Earth now to see Maha yoga. They are watching. Their Spirits are watching this Mahayoga of the children that are Mine.” Alright? It's about [what it means]. I am not so good [at translating] now, I must say. We'll have to sit down. But Marathi language is very, very deep. To bring it out is very difficult but I have tried.

Just put it for her little bit.

Shakuntala: (Sings the Marathi poem to everyone)

Shri Mataji: Now the last bit I just missed the point. “Nyana deepa doliya” - “The eyes lit in the eyes of my children, there in the eyes there's a twinkle in your eye. The light lit in your eyes is that of knowledge, and when it illumines the..’Tejogana’ la English madey kai mantilo? ‘Tejogana’ la kai manje? (meaning: what does ‘Tejogana’ mean in English?)

What are they called? What are called clusters of lights in the Heavens? What do you call them? Constellations? Yes, yes, constellations, yes. And when these lights are enlightened the constellations, as the great evolved souls, have come on this earth as constellations. Because the twinkle in the eyes they see and all of them have come on this Earth to see the Mahayoga that is working through you people. That's a good one. Very beautiful. Thank you. (Applause)

You read it from there, on the...that's better so you are taped off!

Yogini: This song's been written originally by me but I had a lot of help from brother Sahaja Yogis in Sheffield and I need Gareth Reynolds on the guitar really.

Shri Mataji: Can you put this one here (microphone) because otherwise I have to see into the light or if you put the light the other way round. One of the two.

Warren: Move the microphones.

Shri Mataji: I can’t see the face there. If you put it this side it would be better. Yes, that’s very kind. Yes good. Yes that’s better.

(Yogini from Sheffield sings You are the Ocean.)

Shri Mataji: Well done. (Applause) It's a good one. Very beautiful. Very good one. Very well composed and very well done and it's really, I must say, also musically, it's very well composed.

May God bless you. Beautiful. That's the quality.

It's beautiful. That is Sheffield. (Applause)

Are you going to sing? (laughter)

Warren: The catering staff are absolutely insisting that we eat now Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Now better eat [then]. You’d better go and eat, and if you want I can eat also. It's alright. So then music comes to a termination. I am sorry, because they have to eat and I have to go back to London. I Hope to meet you again sometime, I hope so before I go to India, I don't know what is the thing.

But Gavin is trying to arrange a big programme somewhere, again, hoping that in London we'll do better and some people will have some sticking plasters with them! (laughter) So let's see.

May God bless you.

All those who have to eat please go and start otherwise the caterers will starve you!

(Mother is admiring the silver teapot gift)

What a thing you've found I must say. That company is the same as the one we saw is it? Same style, is it the same style? Similar. Ah. But they had no guarantee, nothing and no design. This has guarantee? It has. For how many years?
