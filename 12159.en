Poem by Shri Mataji at the age of 7

I want to be smaller, Like a dust particle.Which moves with the windIt goes everywhere, can go, Sit on the head of a kingOr can goAnd fall at the feet of someone.And it can goAnd sit everywhere.But I want to be a particle of dust That is fragrant, That is nourishingThat is enlightening.

Nirmala Salve
