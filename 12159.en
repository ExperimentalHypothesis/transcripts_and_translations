Poem by Shri Mataji at the age of 7

I want to be smaller, Like a dust particle.
Which moves with the wind
It goes everywhere, can go, Sit on the head of a king
Or can go
And fall at the feet of someone.
And it can go
And sit everywhere.
But I want to be a particle of dust That is fragrant, That is nourishing
That is enlightening.

Nirmala Salve

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
