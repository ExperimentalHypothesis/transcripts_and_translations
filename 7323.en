I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is.  We cannot change, it we cannot transform it, unfortunately we cannot also know it at human awareness.  Whatever they have told you about this mechanism with in us and whatever I am going to tell you about yourself you have to treat it like a hypothesis and you have to keep your mind open like a scientist.  If it is proved that as honest people I hope, you will recognise it.  This instrument definitely lies within us.  We are not aware of it.

Of course, in the medical science they have talked about the plexuses at different levels of our spinal cord. And also, in the brain, they have talked about the crossing of the optic chiasma. Above that as the limbic area which we call as the one thousand petaled lotus.
In the Bible it is described that, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames ". These tongues of flames are like petals, beautifully coloured as you see here, there are different colours to every set and they are extremely soothing to look at. They look like flames but they don’t burn. They soothe you. As it is now, we have to understand that there is a fundamental truth about yourself and that is you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, this intelligence, emotions, but you are the Spirit. So, you have to rise to the level of selfhood as every scripture has said that you have to be born again. that you have to be born again. In Sanskrit language a Realized soul is called as "dvijaha", meaning twice born. And also, a bird is called as "dvijaha". Again, meaning twice born.

So, first a bird is born as an egg, a closed personality, and when it develops and matures then a bird is born out of the same egg.

The same idea they have used about human beings, that first we are human beings where these two ‘institutions’ as you see are covered. But after Realisation, when the residual power of Kundalini rises and pierces through your optic chiasma which is called as Agnya Chakra, then these two ‘institutions’ are sucked in and ultimately it passes through your fontanelle bone area. The second truth is that this whole cosmos is completely covered with the divine love, the Power of God’s love. We do not know about it. We are not aware of it though we have heard about it. Every scripture has described it.

This All-pervading Power of God’s love is the one we have never felt, but you can see the living work, see the beautiful flowers we have here and the beautifully leaves to match them. How they have come from mother earth? We take everything for granted. Such beautiful things are done by nature. Even ourselves! See our heart pulsates, pulsates without we doing anything about it. Look at our eyes, they are beautiful cameras and the brain is a beautiful computer. Who has made this? Then we have evolved from amoeba to human stage. Who has done that? We do not even think. We take it for granted whatever has come to us from this All-pervading divine Power which does all the living work.

This Power is the one which has evolved us to the human level. And the reflection of the same Power is this Kundalini within us which has to rise like a premule in a seed. It has to sprout. And once it is done you get connected to this All-pervading Power. Like this instrument is here and unless and until it is connected to the mains it has no meaning. In a same way we have no meaning. Our life has no meaning till we are connected to the mains. That is the reason that all the problems like ecological problems, political problems, economic problems, family problems, problems, problems, problems, I mean all human problems are created by human beings.

So, we have missed out somewhere and we haven’t got the absolute truth with us, that’s why we are quarrelling. If you knew the absolute truth there’s no question of quarrelling. So, we have missed out somewhere. Even in Science when we start developing something, we have seen that it boomerangs. Like we have got atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb, oxygen bomb is created like devil sitting on our heads anytime we all could be finished. In any walk of life when we use our mental processes it is in a linear way. After sometime it loses its power and boomerangs and that’s how you find in every, every enterprise we take up, there is some after effect of that. So, we do not know how far to go.

But the nature knows. The nature knows how far the tree is going to grow, how far a bush is going to grow and how far the grass is going to grow. But we don’t know and we have got the freedom to choose whichever way we want to go. If you want to go to hell we can go. If you want to go to heaven we can. So now, it is wise for us to think that where have we missed? People I know who are very deft in scriptures whether it is Christian or it is Islamic, or it is Hindu, any scripture, anyone who belongs to all these different religions can commit any crime. There is no control, there is no understanding.

Just recently you have the one thousand people at least were killed, these Azerbaijans, by Christians, can you imagine Christians doing that? In the same way the Muslims have done it. Even the Hindus those who believe that there is a Spirit in every person, then how can they have caste system? How can they look down upon some people who belong to lower caste and higher caste? So, they all have missed some point. Mostly they have become either power oriented or money oriented. None of them seem to be Spirit oriented and so the whole effort is in a wrong direction and that’s how I think we have missed the point where we had to go through the absorption of these religions. We have not been able to absorb. It has not become an innate experience with us. It has to be a very innate experience within our being which is not, which is outside.

Today we are reading some book, some scripture and tomorrow we can go and do anything which is sinful, which is wrong which is destructive. What is the matter? Why it has happened? Because the power of absorption can only come when you become the Spirit. Spirit is the light when it enters into your attention, then you absorb religion which is innate within you because religion is not outside, it is within as Christ has said that, "The kingdom of God is within yourself".

Now this religion within us which is enlightened by the Spirit is like our valency. Carbon has four valencies while human beings have ten valencies. And when these ten valencies are enlightened within us, then we don’t have to worry about creating some sin or getting some sort of a punishment for something. We automatically become, automatically, spontaneously, become righteous and the righteousness starts manifesting itself. But apart from that the attention which is being enlightened by the Spirit becomes extremely dynamic.

Now see your seen this Australians singing Indian songs and Sanskrit songs and Marathi. I must say Marathi is one of the most difficult languages to think of, but worse is Sanskrit, you see.
From childhood Indians are not allowed to eat betel nut because they think they can’t pronounce these tongue twisters, you see. Imagine these Australians singing so beautifully that from outside nobody can know who is singing. It looks like some Indians are singing this song and the same vice versa. Indians sing also English songs very well. How they have learnt? The English were ruling us for 300 years. They couldn’t pronounce one sentence in ordinary Hindi language.

We had to work out with them some sort of thing like, they wanted to know: "Please close the door" So, how to say? They can’t say that in Hindi language. So, we used to all right say, "There was a cold day". Then they would say "There was a cold day" meaning, say that ‘darwaza khole dey’ in Hindi. It was such a terrible situation to teach them even one sentence of English, while how these children are playing so well. They become so dynamic. There are many artists in India who came to Sahaja Yoga and have become world famous. Otherwise also, even in Australia we have some painters and artists who have become very famous after coming to Sahaja Yoga. Because the attention becomes very concentrated and deep into any subject you enter it, you get the deftness of it. You become the master of it. Any subject you want to do it and that’s how we have people who have done very well even materially in Sahaja Yoga. But at the same time, Spirit is the witness, witness of the whole play. But when it comes into the attention, we also become the witness. We see everything as a drama, as a play.

Today while coming to your city we lost our way three times. And they were saying, "I don’t know when we are going to reach". I said, "Don’t worry. We are supposed to go there, accept it. We are supposed to go to all these places that is why we went there. And we'll be there in time, you shouldn’t worry about that". So, it is a kind of a witness. Really, we saw some beautiful things because we were lost, [laughter] which normally we would never have seen.

When you become the witness, to you the whole thing is just a play and you are not involved into it. The state that is achieved through Self-realisation is first as we call it, is thoughtless awareness.
The other day many people asked us, "Mother we go on thinking, how are we going to meditate?" I said, "You are not to meditate. You are in meditation". "How?" "Because when this Kundalini passes through the centre of Agnya then its sucks in the thought process".

For example, the thoughts are coming either from the future or from the past. If I say, "Now you stand in your present", you cannot. We do not know the present. Either it is the future we are thinking about or we are thinking about the past. And we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts all the time from one to another. Some people really go mad and in Switzerland one doctor told me, "You cut my throat or do what you like but stop my thinking". So, sometimes this bombardment is too much. But when this Kundalini rises, what she does, these thoughts which rise and fall and rise and fall, there is a space in between, and she stops us at that space, which is the present and is the silence. It’s the silence within us. Gradually it starts increasing and we develop that state of thoughtless awareness.

When our spirituality starts growing higher than that state when the kundalini processes through your fontanelle bone area and your connection is well established. Because the Kundalini comes down, if you are sick, you have liver problems, it comes down, cures you, again goes up. Then you have a problem, it goes up and down, up and down, like a yo-yo and then ultimately, it has to fix it itself. Once it is fixed, then you reach a state which we call as doubtless awareness, "nirvikalpa samadhi". At that state, you develop all the powers of a Realised soul.

To say that, "I am twice born, I am born again" is just another brand to put on your head, whether you put the brand of a Christian, Hindu, Muslim is just a brand. It has nothing to do with it and for that to make it reality, once you are a Realized soul automatically you understand that you are ‘that’. There is no doubt about it. You are a Christian, you are a Muslim, you are a Hindu at the same time. Because all the essence of these religions are the same. We fight because we don’t know the absolute problem. How can all these religions be born in an absurd way that "this fights that and that fights that"? How can it be? If it is one God, if it is Divinity, how can it? Logically it cannot.

This is the biggest problem now. The world has to face is fundamentalism. Some are very sophisticated fundamentalists and some are very open exposed fundamentalists but they are fundamentalists, because they cannot see the good points of another religion. They think they are the best but they are not! You can see in their lives they are just like anybody else. And when people cling on to some dogmas or some sort of a clan like that, it is an impossible situation because they are so much mesmerized with the idea that they do not think of their benevolence. I just asked, "My child, your father did the same, his father did the same. You are doing the same. Now what is the gain, what did you achieve?"

As a result of Self-realization, it’s not a brand but you get the powers. First power you get that you can feel this All-pervading Power on your fingertips. Then on your hands it starts. This movement has a sort of a computer quality that you can find out what’s wrong with you, with your centres. As shown here, you will see which is 1, these are 5, 6, and 7 centres on the left. In the same way on the right hand. These centres relate to the power of a desire we can say to the left side to our subconscious and collective subconscious, to our past. And these centres relate to our physical and to our mental being, to our future and to the futuristic ideas.

So, we can feel it on our fingertips. As you say, you should have knowledge on your fingertips. So, you really get the knowledge on your fingertips. And you start feeling what’s wrong with you, also, you can feel what’s wrong with anyone. Because you develop a new consciousness, a new power of Collective Consciousness. Who is the other? When a drop becomes the ocean, when the microcosm becomes the macrocosm, then who is the other?
You can feel another person on your fingertips. Only thing you have to know how to improve, to correct and heal these centres which are in jeopardy, who are in trouble. So, we, start talking in the language of centres. So, we, start talking in the language of centres. We don’t say, "Something wrong with you, you are egoistic". No. We say, "Your Agnya is catching".

And a person who is suffering himself will come and say. He will not feel shy. He will say, “Mother my Agnya is catching means I am very egoistical”. Nobody will say like that to anyone, never confess. But It gives you a headache. So, he says, "All right, better correct it. Mother I have got a headache with this Agnya". It becomes an innate feeling and innate religion within yourself. So, nobody has to tell you because in the light of the Spirit the Spirit becomes your master. So, you become your own master. It can guide you. It shows you the way and you don’t know you go to the Eternity. How far you will grow into it? One can’t say. But I’ve seen people. Now, as they have told me, we are working in 62 countries. I haven’t visited all of them. And also, I know of at least 52 countries who always come to India. We have a seminar of these people who come down. It is very surprising, such beautiful angelic people they are. There is no question of quarrel, fights. There is no question of lust. Somebody’s wife running with somebody, somebody’s husband running with somebody, flirting with someone. Nothing of the kind. Very pure relationships.

As they say "khalis", "there's a Khalistan" you see, but the word came from Nanaka. He said, "You have to be khalis", means pure. Such purified lives they have! And such love, such brotherhood, such sisterhood beautiful understanding and they are so powerful that they can raise the Kundalini of people that they can cure people and they are so knowledgeable. Such a society has been already formed. Such a unique race has been already there. Now we have to see how many more would like to join, to enjoy themselves the Spirit that is within themselves.

In this little lecture, I don’t think I’ll be able to tell you all about it. Only thing I have to tell you as in this hall there are many lights and if you have to put the lights on, you just have to tell somebody that, "All right, this is the switch. Put on and it’s all done because it is built in”. All this is built in within you. I don’t have to do anything. It’s your own power which will be awakened. Of course, you can’t pay for it. It is a living process like the Mother Earth. She sprouts these flowers. How much do we pay her? We don’t pay her anything. She doesn’t understand money, she doesn’t understand banking. She doesn’t understand even recession. That is our headache. That mother earth is innocent. That’s her job is just to sprout these flowers in the same way that kundalini gets sprouted. There is no obligation, you cannot pay for it. For awakening you cannot pay, for the knowledge you cannot pay for it, you cannot pay for anything. Of course, you have to pay for this hall for which I’m sure some Sahaja Yogis have paid or we have a Trustee that must have paid for this hall.

But you cannot pay for a Spiritual life. One has to understand this very clearly. But I don’t know how everybody has become so money oriented that it has penetrated into also our religious groups and religious movements. It cannot be. It’s absolutely wrong. Anybody who says that he pays, you have to pay for a certain kind of emancipation or some kind of an awareness like TM and all those nonsensical things, beware them. It is absolutely nonsensical. I must warn you that all kinds of thugs have come out of India and are absolutely leeching them.
It is such a serious thing. They have not only taken money. After all, there are so many thuggeries going on, doesn’t matter.

Once upon a time the English came and looted us so they are going on looting English, but that’s a different thing. There are looters all over the world. But these are not only that way, they spoil your kundalini. They spoil your basic fundamental thing and that’s why you have to be very careful that first of all you should find out that what are the disciples like. How are they? How do they talk? How do they live? What is their style is? And then once it has happened that you have seen that it is perfectly all right, they are wonderful people, they have something special, then you should go to any such group.
Instead of just like a fashion there is something, advertisement comes, so we are running after that. Because they make money so they can advertise better. They have ways and methods. They have great advertising departments. But these are advertising departments to Hell. One has to be very careful because you are seekers of truth and these are born in this modern times. As William Blake* has rightly said that, "Men of God will be born and they will become godly and make others saintly". This is what is Sahaja Yoga in short.

I am sorry I wouldn’t be able to tell you in details about it. But you have to be collective and I am very happy to know that we have got a nice centre here and you can learn a lot whatever you want to know, how to fix your connection with the divine Power. This is Yoga. Yoga means the connection with divine Power. As it is, I would like you to ask me some questions but the question should not be aggressive. I have not come here to take away anything from you. I have come here to give you what is your own. So, it should be a relevant question and should not be a big lecture to people.

Sometimes I find somebody is coming from some fundamentalist thing and starts giving a big lecture bigger than mine, and people want to run away. And I have to show all the patience. So, please, be wise and ask sensible questions. One thing I must say, that 22 years I have been facing people of different types of different cultures, and different natures. What I find that I can answer all the questions very well. No because it is the training now, I’ve learnt, but answering the question also is a mental feat. That doesn’t guarantee the awakening of the kundalini. It’s something very different because it is beyond your mind. You have to go beyond your mind. It is not the work of the mind that you can do through your mind but is beyond your mind. So, even if I answer you there is no guarantee that that will be all right for your Kundalini awakening. It will, of course, work out, I am sure, that it is going to work out for all of you.

So, if you have any sensible questions, I would definitely like to answer them because when the kundalini will be rising, I don't want your mind to come out and say that, "Come along, we did not ask this question". So, and you have freedom to ask the question.

Sahaja Yogi: He is asking how significant the colours are in the chakras.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: How significant are the colours to the chakras, because he has read sometimes that they are different colours.
Shri Mataji: These are the colours which you see actually in the chakras. But supposing something wrong with the chakras is, then maybe it may not look the same colour. When they are healthy chakras they look of this colour.

Sahaja Yogi: He says there seems to be a conflict in what he has read, that some of these chakras are represented as different colours altogether.
Shri Mataji: That is not so important, my child. You see, what you have to have is your Realization. That’s the main thing. Now supposing I am here, I am seeing you all, isn’t? I am inside. In the same way, when you’re crossing through all these chakras, you just know you are inside it. But you don’t see any colours, nothing. You just see as if you are passing. Like I was coming now here, I was just coming to Wollongong. And I didn't see what was around, supposing. And even if I see, it's not important, I have to reach. So, that is not so important. The first thing you must get your Realization. All right?

Sahaja Yogi: He wants to know a little more about what we mean by the Spirit and what, how that is related to our consciousness and how the two things are linked by Self-realization?
Shri Mataji: It’s a good question. Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within us. He said that, He has made human beings in his own image. Now we should not get confused with the word image. Image means the reflection. So, we reflect God Almighty. We are not God but we reflect. Image is different from the actual thing. So, now when you are as a human being then the Spirit is just a witness in the heart watching you. And the seat of the God Almighty is here and He is reflecting in the human heart. He is just watching. He is a witness. He doesn’t come into your attention. He's watching you.

But when Realization takes place, when Kundalini pierces through this, then it starts flowing into our attention, the light of the Spirit. The attention that we have is the consciousness. We have general consciousness a human consciousness you can say, which is expressed through our central nervous system. For example, in our evolution, we have a consciousness which is much deeper and higher than that of animals. Like a dog or somebody, if you want to put him into some sort of a dirty place it would stay there, it won’t have any problems to pass through. But a human being cannot because he can feel. We can feel the beauty, we can feel the colours, we can see so many things much subtler than animals do and this is all through our central nervous system. So, whatever we achieve in our evolution is recorded on our central nervous system which manifests it. But when I am talking about Self-realization then the Spirit manifests all our conscious mind, and this conscious mind becomes a special type of an enlightened conscious mind. And that conscious mind then, when is completely in contact with his divine Power, can control the parasympathetic nervous system which is within us.

I do not know how many of you are medically equipped. But I will tell you what parasympathetic is. We have got a central nervous system and also we have another system called as autonomous nervous system. Now nobody knows what this "auto" is, but they named it "auto". Now, this system has got three other systems left and right sympathetic and the central system which we call as the parasympathetic. So, whenever we are in an emergency, we use these two sympathetic nervous systems left and right. Supposing we want to run then we run and our heart starts beating fast. This happens to the sympathetic activity but the parasympathetic activity brings it to the normal. We cannot bring it to the normal. So, what happens after this [Realization], your conscious mind which is enlightened can control your parasympathetic activities.

Supposing a person is enlightened and another person, he meets, who has hurt himself and his bone has become crooked. He puts his hand on that bone and slowly the bone starts melting away and going to the normal state. After some time, he doesn’t even have to put [the hand] just attention. With the attention also he can do very simple things, because now your attention which is the conscious mind becomes enlightened. On the other hand, if you use your conscious mind too much, all the time thinking, planning futuristic thing going on, then what happens, this conscious mind becomes very, very sluggish weak or you can say extremely weak. And this I told people in America about 8-10 years but that you will get a disease by which your conscious mind will become absolutely good for nothing. And that’s what has happened now, called as the yuppy's disease, where the conscious mind doesn’t work. Unconsciously one may walk, one may lift the hand, one may do anything, but consciously he cannot. So, they just become like reptiles if you see them. On the television, I saw, it is shocking.

They are just carried like big fishes on the shoulders of people. They can sit if they are fixed for sitting posture, they cannot talk but they think, they cannot write, they cannot do anything with the conscious mind. On the contrary, when the conscious mind is enlightened, it becomes a dynamic force and gradually your beauty, your glory starts opening and recording what you are on your conscious mind which is an enlightened one. It is a very good question but it requires more time but as it is I would say first you get your Realization and gradually you will know how your conscious mind has become so alert.

Sahaja Yogi: For the awakening of Kundalini can you suggest the best form of meditation?
Shri Mataji: You see I was saying that we will be doing that process now and the Kundalini will be awakened. But as it is you have to be in meditation, you don’t have to do meditation. So first, I will do that today I’m sure all of you will get your Realization tonight definitely. After that, you have to come to the collective. Of course, you don’t have to pay anything there, but then you will know what are the problems you are having within yourself and how to solve them. And once your connection is established, then there’s no question of you not realizing what you are and how many powers you have. That I am going to do just now.

[Realization process]

All right, so I think we can have the process of Kundalini awakening which is a very, very simple thing.  Very simple.  It’s spontaneous, it works automatically but still, I’ll tell you how to nourish your own centres and how you can yourself awaken your Kundalini in a way.  But there are certain conditions which I must tell you.  The first condition is that I cannot force Self-realisation on you.  You are absolutely free.  If you want to have your awakening you can have it, but I cannot force it.  It is your desire.  This Kundalini is the power of pure desire.  All other desires are impure because once you get one thing you want to have another thing, another thing, another thing.  But this kundalini when she rises then you are absolutely self-content.  So, this is the desire which is the pure desire and you have to have pure desire to get your Realisation, otherwise it won’t work out.  If you are trying to be cunning or if you are cheating it won’t work out because it knows. Your kundalini knows you very well.  She is your mother.  She is your individual mother.  Like a tape recorder, she knows everything about you.  Like your mother as when she gave you your birth, she took up all the labour and all the trouble in the same way this Kundali manages and she awakens by itself.  You don’t have to worry about anything.  You don’t have to think about it.  It is absolutely spontaneous.  But one thing is there that you should have a desire to have kundalini awakening and your Self-realisation it cannot be forced.  It cannot be forced.

The second condition is that you have to be sure.  You should be absolutely self-confident that all of you can get your Self-realisation.  Absolutely. There is no question.  You do not know what sort of special seekers you are and that’s why don’t doubt yourself.  Not at all.

The third condition is that you should not feel guilty at all. I don’t know why people feel very guilty.  You should never feel guilty.  If you feel guilty the centre here on the left side catches, and this is a very bad thing because if it happens you get diseases like angina, spondylitis also your organs become lethargic. So, you should not by any chance feel guilty which is a very easy thing to do.  It is just the mental idea that you are guilty.  Is just mental. Is your own imagination that you are guilty about something.

The third one is you have to forgive everyone in general.  Logically whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything.  You don’t do anything.  But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.  Actually, the people who have troubled you, who have made you unhappy are quite happy. Why you are torturing yourself and playing into their hands? So, what’s the use of carrying on this.

Moreover, this centre that I’ve told you about is this, the Agnya is like this and it has to be opened out is only possible if you really forgive everyone just to say, and don’t think of people whom you want to forgive, because that’s also unnecessary and will give you a headache. So, the best thing is to forgive everyone, in general.  It is the easiest thing to do if you know it is just your mental myth in your head.

So, these are the few conditions that you have to follow which are very simple and it would be very easy for you to get your Realisation, no problem.  Now one thing one has to do is to take out the shoes because this Mother Earth is very helpful to us.  She sucks in our problem so if it is easy to take out your shoes will be a good idea. You will feel comfortable also. Again, I would say those who do not want to have their Realisation should leave the hall in all civility because it is not proper to disturb others. It will hardly take ten minutes but one should not disturb others, look at others and not at yourself.  This is the first time you are going to look at yourself which is beautiful.

[So one who asked the question is the first to leave.  Big problems sometimes. See now. Mother laughs.  Big long question and that’s what they are.  Mental people].

All right? So, now we have to, I will show you what is to be done which is very simple.  Put your left hand towards me on your lap which is suggestive, comfortably, you have to sit comfortably don’t have to go to the Himalayas, stand on your head, or on one leg nothing of that kind.  Just be comfortable. You should not, of course, slouch back and also sort of bend, that is not the thing but sit comfortably with the left hand.

All right, now put your left hand towards me like that simple as that, which suggests that you are desirous of having your Self-realisation. You have to put both your feet apart from each other because there are two powers.  One is the power of desire left side and the power of action, on the right side.  So now the left hand you put towards myself, it suggests that symbolically you want to have your Self-realisation.

We use the right hand to nourish our centres and to show our self-confidence.  So now first we put our hand on the right hand.  I will show so you now and later we will close the eyes.

This is the centre as I told you is where the Spirit resides.  Now if you are the Spirit then in the light of the Spirit you become your own master.  So now take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.  We are working only on the left-hand side.

This is the centre on the left-hand side, which is your mastery.  When you become the Spirit gradually you become the master of yourself and the master of all this knowledge.  This is created by great prophets and great Masters, Real Masters for us.  Then we take down our hand in the lower portion of our abdomen on the left-hand side.  This is the centre of pure knowledge, surprisingly, that the centre of pure knowledge is here.  Once you get a pure knowledge you will know what are the laws which are divine, also you will know how to use them, and how to act according to them.

Now raise your hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen and then again on your heart, now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder here and turn your head to your right.  At this point again I have to say that you are not to feel guilty, this centre is catching quite a lot so please don’t feel guilty.  You are not going to miss your Realisation by that.  Now you are to take your right hand on top of your forehead with your fingers on one side and your thumb on the other and press it hard and put it down as far as possible.  This is the centre for forgiving everyone in general.

Now we take back our right hand on the backside of the head and push back to our heads as far as possible.  This is the centre where without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-pervading Power of God’s love.  Now here is your hand again, you stretch your palm fully.  Put the centre of your palm on the centre of fontenelle bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood.

This is for the actualizing of your baptism through which the kundalini will come out, will pierce through. This is very important centre.  Now, remember to push back your fingers as far as possible.  Now put down your head and push back your fingers and move your scalp slowly 7 times clockwise.  Please push back your fingers.  That is very important so that you put good pressure on your scalp and more it 7 times clockwise slowly.  That’s all we have to do.  That’s all.

Now we have to close our eyes and you can take out your spectacles because you shouldn’t open your eyes till I tell you. Also, if you have something very tight on your waist, very tight or on your back then you can little bit reduce the pressure on these two centres.

Whatever I have told you all these conditions in short means you should be very pleasantly placed towards your self because you are going to enter into the kingdom of God. So, you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

Now please put left hand like this towards me.  Both the feet apart from each other and put the right hand on your heart and now close your eyes.  Here you have to ask a very fundamental question about you to me you can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji, whatever you like.  Please ask a question three times in your heart, all these questions are to be asked in your heart, "Mother, am I the Spirit?".  Ask this question, three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

As I told you if you are the Spirit you get the guide to yourself so you become a master of yourself.  The Spirit becomes your master.  So now take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.  Here ask another fundamentally question three times, "Mother, am I my own master?" "Mother, am I my own master?" "Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question 3 times, please.

I have already told you that I respect your freedom and pure knowledge cannot be forced on you.  Please take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen.  The centre has got 6 petals so please ask 6 times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge",  "Mother, please give me pure knowledge",  "Mother, please give me pure knowledge",  6 times.

When you ask pure knowledge the Kundalini starts moving upward so we have to nourish our upper centres with our self-confidence.  So please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it.  Here again, you have to say with full confidence 10 times, "Mother, I am my own master".  Please say it with full confidence 10 times "Mother, I am my own master".

I have already told you the fundamental truth about you is that you are not this body, this mind, you are not this conditionings and the ego, nor these emotions and intelligence, but you are the pure Spirit.  So now raise your right hand on top your heart and here with full confidence please say 12 times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit".  Please say it, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit".  Please say it 12 times.

Now one has to understand that this all pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion, love and peace, is the ocean of truth but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever wrong you might have done, this ocean of forgiveness can completely forgive you.  It is that powerful.

So forgive yourself and raise your right hand into the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right.  Here you have to again say it with full confidence 16times full confidence, "Mother, I am not guilty at all".  "Mother, I am not guilty at all".  Please say it 16 times with full confidence.

I have already told you whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything but if you don’t forgive then you play into the wrong hands so you have to forgive.  If you don’t forgive as it is all your life you are playing into wrong hands and if you don’t forgive you’ll also miss out your Realisation because this centre won’t open, so please forgive.

Now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across, put your fingers on one side and your thumb on the other and press it hard on the temples and now put it down your head as far as possible.  Here again, you have to say with full confidence from your heart not how many times, but from your heart, Mother I forgive everyone in general.  "Mother, I forgive everyone in general".  This is very important.  Without your forgiving, I cannot forgive you.  You have to forgive yourself.

Now please take your right hand now at the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Now here you have to say again with full confidence and from your heart, not how many times, without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction you have to say, "O all-pervading power please forgive me if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly".  "O all-pervading power if I have done anything wrong knowingly or not knowingly please forgive me".  Say it with full confidence.

Now the last centre which is very important, please stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of your head on the fontanelle bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood.  Now put down your head as far as possible and push back your fingers please this is very important that please push back your fingers.  Here again, I cannot force Self-realisation on you because I respect your freedom, I cannot cross over it so move your hand now 7 times slowly clockwise saying 7 times, "Mother please give me Self-realization".  "Mother, please give me Self-realisation".

Now please take down your hands.  Open your eyes.  You can wear your glasses.  Now put your hand towards me please like this.  Just watch me without thinking. Let us see.  Please watch me without thinking.

Now please put the right hand forward like this, and bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool or a warm or hot breeze like waves are coming from your Fontenelle bone area, but don’t put the hand on top of your head but away from it and see for yourself.  Sometimes you get it very far, sometimes quite close. So just feel if there is cool or hot or warm Breeze like waves are coming.  It is, you have to certify yourself.

Now put the left hand towards me.  Now again put down your head and see for yourself again if there is a cool breeze or a warm or hot breeze is coming.  It is warm or hot because you have not forgiven perhaps or maybe you have a liver problem or some other problem.  But doesn’t matter at least you must forgive.

Please forgive to help me and help yourself.  Please forgive.  Again, we put your right hand towards me and put down your left hand on top of your head and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze or hot or a warm breeze coming out of your head.  Bend your head.  Bend.  If you don’t bend it won’t be so much clear.  Just bend.

Now raise your both the hands towards the sky like this and turn your head towards the sky upwards.  Here you have to ask me a question.  Any one of these 3 questions you can ask any question 3 times, "Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? " Or, "Mother is this the all-pervading power of God’s Love?" or "Mother is this the Paramachaitanya?"  Ask any one of these questions three times.  Put your hands up and your head upwards and just ask this question in your heart.

Now please take down your hands.  Put your hands like this.  All those who have felt cool, warm or hot breeze like the thing out of their Fontenelle, or their fingertips please raise put your hands.

May God bless you.

What seekers, what great people, May God bless you.

Your sainthood has started.  It is like the sprouting of the seed now.  Christ has said a parable and this is the parable again I tell you.  The seeds which have sprouted have to grow into trees.  It takes no time what so ever. But you have to come to the collective. You enjoy this peace, you enjoy this joy within yourself but you have to come to the collective.  This is the only way you will be cleansed.

In Sahaja yoga, it is very simple. You have to give some time in a week to come to the collective and they will tell you how to meditate for 5 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening.  The minimum that much is needed but if you like it you can do it more.  It is a very simple method, has to be simple because it is very [UNCLEAR].  You are now joining a big revolution in the whole world which has to bring forth the Spirituality into the whole humanity transforming it.

May God bless you all.

Thank you very much.
