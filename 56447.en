How do you like these things here?

You see all these marinas, big things, we call it as the Western garden, you see, the whole thing is called as ‘Sahyadri’, these are ranges of Sahyadri. And as you know, Maharashtra is made out of the plateau. And this is one side like this and the other side is the sea. And we are moving on the hills, like that.
Gavin: This is a totally different landscape, that’s much richer.

Shri Mataji: Yes. Yes, of course. That side is very huge. Bombay and all that is beyond this, you see. There’s a small strip of land to the sea. Then this higher land and then the plateau. It’s like that. But it’s a very different type.

Be careful! These are Americans.
