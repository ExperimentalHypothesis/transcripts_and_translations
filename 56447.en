Shri Mataji: So, better to send him to Kolhapur. Because now we are going to another place.
How do you like these things here?

You see all these marinas, big things, we call it as the Western garden, you see, the whole thing is called as ‘Sahyadri’, these are ranges of Sahyadri. And as you know, Maharashtra is made out of the plateau. And this is one side like this and the other side is the sea. And we are moving on the hills, like that.
Gavin: This is a totally different landscape, that’s much richer.

Shri Mataji: Yes. Yes, of course. That side is very huge. Bombay and all that is beyond this, you see. There’s a small strip of land to the sea. Then this higher land and then the plateau. It’s like that. But it’s a very different type.

Be careful! These are Americans.
[Laughter]
Hello, mister, you’ll be here this side. They catch, Americans, very fast. [Laughter]

Yes, they are horrible ones.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, would you like to give it to the school ...
Shri Mataji: Not to the schools, but to the centre here.
Sahaja Yogi: Centre, yes.

Shri Mataji: This is the Karama [unsure] name, very simple, you know, very simple.
Very simple, they have made it out stone, this way.

Shri Mataji: The girls are still singing.
Sahaja Yogis: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Beautiful song, it was very beautiful, about the Adi Shakti, you see. Tremendous! Tremendous. Sahaja Yogis. In the end, they say about Sahaja Yoga. And also the poetry was so great, I think. I don’t know from where they get things like that.
Sahaja Yogis: From you, Mother.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: They said that, Mother Earth has become the sign. You see, like that poetry. So tremendous!

[Marathi conversation]

Shri Mataji: Six thousand people now came. My feet, you see, get swollen up.
Yesterday, [Marathi conversation]

[It seems that people come to do namaskar and then sit down anywhere in the room.]
Sahaja Yogi: No, no. In the middle.
Shri Mataji: You must bring them, bring them and seat there in this line. So much so, that’s all. No, no, no, no. Not double [unclear]. This line is all right. You have to get up and take this line.
Indian Sahaja Yogi: You have to get up and go away following this [unsure].

[Unclear English words]

This fruit is from my own place, Nagpur, they make big, big oranges like this. You see how these oranges are very different from yours, you see.
[Shri Mataji shows the orange]. Big!
Try it. You try it.

And this is the place, you see, just see. This is the place where Rama is very much worshipped. They found out this [unclear] also. Ramdas Swami is a worshipper of Rama because he was Hanuman himself. And all these fruits are, they are called as Ramphal because Rama was very fond of these fruits. So, they grow mostly here in [unclear]. Now these are the same. This one is another one.

[Laughter]
But now when we go there, we have got enough place to dance. There, you should bring.

Because I was thinking we are going just now to [unclear]. There we will be sleeping [unsure].

Don’t try to put anything on top. We will have to go on the other side with another bus.
Indian Sahaja Yogi: Those who are sleeping on the banties, and not sleeping on the ground, please go outside. We have made arrangements within the next room. Otherwise, there is another room, please.

[Marathi conversation]

He is a master of the school.
[Applause]
He is doing such a good job. [Marathi conversation]

I hope you have picked up how to eat with your fingers. But I must say, it’s quite easier with your finger than with fork and spoon.

And you learn [unclear]. It’s very natural, isn’t it?

[About the instrument] [Unclear]. You have to take it out with your hands and play.
[Marathi conversation in the back]

Shri Mataji: But learn [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear].

Alexandre: Mother, why cows are so cool ? Why? [unclear about a cow]. And it starts to such my finger, it cleansed my Swadisthan-
Shri Mataji: Who?
Alexandre: A cow.
Indian are very special ones. You see, once, Adi Shakti had taken her birth as a real cow. It was only once. This is the second [unclear].
So Indian cow is [unclear] sacred. [Unclear].
Now this is [unclear] very, very holy.
Alexandre: And they are very, very cool, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Very cool.

That is the best animal [unsure], that’s why Indians don’t need cows to eat.

I went to one, Sahaja Yogis. I went to one husband dream [unsure], a Sahaja Yogi. And he said that they have lots of Australian cows and Indian cows. And all the Indian cows just take him and bowed to Me, because they all rushed towards Me, vey simply. And first these Australian cows, they run away.
[Laughter]
And they [unclear], you see, and they just came rushing towards Me, just to meet Me.
[Unclear]. [Laughter]

So, after vibrations, they found out that Indian cows give quite a lot of milk, not as much as Australian cows, Australian cows, it’s too much, quite a lot, much more [unclear].
The taste of the milk of Indians cows is the very different and very good. So they decided not to [unclear], but just to give them vibrations.

Sahaja Yogi: Did they improve?
Shri Mataji: Yes. Also, they have found out that if you give them the milk of the [unclear], children become very, I don’t know how [unclear] them. Something in that [unclear].

If they start, if the people in the West become a little more humble, this would give better Agnya. But they are very proud, you see, and they think they have a right to judge everyone. It’s very stupid. They never appreciate anything. They just think they have a right to criticize, to judge everyone. While quality wise, you see, these people are much better.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s true.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: [Unclear].
Very stupid to judge everyone, to [unclear] about everyone. About everything, they think they have a right. I mean, I don’t know why they think so much about themselves. They have to think of God, not about themselves. What God is going to come up? [Unsure]
What is God’s opinion about them? That, they don’t think. They just think about themselves I mean, they have to give an opinion, instead of God giving an opinion. I think see this is the problem; they are just stupid.

If you think that the God has to judge you, ultimately, God has to judge you. Then, we should not judge others and to judge other’s things. But on the contrary, we should be prepared that we’ll be judged [unclear].

I mean Indians don’t talk of Last Judgement, but they are all the time, judging themselves, in the sense that they know, "This is bad manners". For them, so many have bad manners. It is not bad manners, otherwise [unclear].

Alexandre: ...I thought about Indian cows, so let’s have one in our ashram.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: We are going to have cows in our [unclear].
[Marathi conversation, unclear]
Even the Indians don’t [unclear]. Think of the Spanish bulls [unsure]. We have never seen such bulls in India.

[Marathi conversation]
Shri Mataji: We don’t have bull fighters. [Laughter]
