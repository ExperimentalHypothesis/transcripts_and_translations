1989-1030 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Istanbul Turkey DP-RAW

I have you got those [UNCLEAR], you see, New York, you got those Chinese, tremendous people. He wants Me to go to Taiwan?

Yogi: Wow.

Shri Mataji: I'll go in February, I said. March, March, March. Poor Australians, very very unhappy. [laughter]

It was such a short time, must have fallen and then they had to know, there was a strike, a strike of the, you could call those pilots. So, going from one place to another, take a four, five days and it was such a schmuck.

Can you close the [window]?

As it is, so, they were very disappointed. Then they wrote to Me, Mother, something wrong with us. Why did you come? Nothing, nothing wrong [UNCLEAR]. But I mean, I am not free, I was fixed up again.

Guido: You belong to the whole, to the whole of humanity now, Shri Mataji. You belong to the whole universe, to the whole of humanity.

Shri Mataji: That's true. And this Devi Puja was in Perth and in Perth it was going to be. And then we said that, now it's not, I'm not travelling, this that. I just forgot about it completely that Devi Puja is there. Just forgot. And suddenly it came into my head, there must be some Puja very close by. Just a feeling coming in. So I told David, I said 'David there is some sort of a Puja we have to have?'. [He said] 'What Mother?' and I said 'Ah you know what!' Imagine we would have missed the Devi Puja?

Yogis: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: So he arranged in Margate, it was wonderfully done. But Diwali Puja was very very...

Yogis: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]

Akbar: Guido, tell us about it.

Guido: It was really unique.

Shri Mataji: You can't describe it was so great.

Guido: Unique. Three days, unique.

Shri Mataji: Really too much. Unbelievable.

Guido: Very intense, really.

Akbar: You have to tell us stuff from the beginning [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Very quiet, huh?

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Just the opposite of that house.

Akbar: Exactly the house that you described, Shri Mataji.

Yogini: That it should be a little bit higher.

Shri MatajI: Yes, I did say.

Akbar: Exactly, fine, this same place. A little bit, high?

Shri Mataji: As I said, so much on the road sort of thing, the sea was there, everybody was fishing there.

Akbar: Yes, yes and also they were these two restaurants close by.

Shri Mataji: Was close, yup.

Akbar: They make all the intestines, you always smelling it.

Shri Mataji: And the landlady was not good also.

Akbar: The landlady.

Yogini: No.

Guido: And the mosquitos on top.

Yogini: The mosquitos, the mosquitos were too much, everything together, it was too much!

Akbar: In the first time when I was sleeping there, at 4 o 'clock, half past 4, really I jumped because there was a lot of people in the morning. I jumped, what's happening here?

Shri Mataji: But this Gali is an Indian name. You have a great poet called Gali.

Guido: Gali?

Akbar: Yes.

Guido: He is Gali.

Akbar: He is Sufi man.

Shri Mataji: Ah, that's why.

Akbar: He brought all the Quran, say here, look, he is writing this, here, here, here.

Shri Mataji:Really?

Guido: We brought something for you, Shri Mataji talked about.

Akbar: Wow.

Guido: We brought the green book.

Shri Mataji: This is with our sightings.

Guido: I got it, I got it. Where are the luggage?

Akbar: All here.

Guido: I give it.

Shri Mataji: In search of the door. I don't know who, many, must have consulted. We must have consulted some scholars. Udo is a German.

Yogini: Udo, yes.

Shri Mataji: The Germans are very scholarly, no doubt. And the Quran must have been translated into German language. This must be the reason.

Yogini: That's what they found that we don't have so many references to the Quran. So we should maybe...

Shri Mataji: Search it out.

Yogini: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: How can it? He was Dattatreya himself, you see. See, but the people at that time were all tribal people, tribes, and fighting with each other. So how much can you tell to such people?

Yogini: To teach?

Shri Mataji: It's very difficult. I mean, they were horrible, very primitive, fighting and killing. It's a big tribal thing which was going on, strive. Which strive comes up? So many men were killed, so many. Very few men were well left. So He thought it's better that the women go into some sort of an Adharmic life. He said, have even four wives, doesn't matter. You can marry even young girls, but marry.

Yogini: Yes, just to keep them in the family.

Shri Mataji: In the family. And I'm having this green colour. They have done it.

Akbar: Muslim country, yes. Say Muslim. [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: One thing, she's the only sister who's not married to a [UNCLEAR] in life.

Akbar: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Better get married [UNCLEAR].

Yogini: Shri Mataji.

Akbar: I cannot sleep every night, Shri Mataji. I cannot sleep comfortably as long as she's not married.

Yogini: What are you saying? [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: What did he say?

Guido: He cannot sleep in the night because she's not married. He's concerned about her sister.

Shri Mataji: You are what kind of brothers you are? You must arrange your marriage.

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: All the time teasing her, yesterday, Patrick, how he was dancing. I was too much really. [Laughter] I just couldn't believe it. Everybody's after her.

Yogini: So big fighting going on here.

Akbar: This year I think is the last year. [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Everybody doubts. Your husband is working with the [UNCLEAR]?

Yogini: Yes.

Guido: The lady thought that I was your husband.

Yogini: Ah who?

Guido: The journalist. She was thinking I was her husband. [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: You are so close, I have to be honest and so pure, such pure relations, no problem. Suddenly the innocence has grown in us, that's part of it. And people enjoy that innocence.

Akbar: Yes, Shri Mataji, especially in the Muslim country, one of the things they told us after that impressed them was our relations. They could see that this pure relation between us brothers, sisters something. They were very amazed to see.

Shri Mataji: Very pure relations, really. We never have this problem. Never have. Except for very, I mean once only as remember in Germany, in some places, in Austria. But just for a while, that's all. But there were very new people. I mean imagine where there's so much of impurity in the western style of life, that you should suddenly make everybody so clean and so beautiful. Just see this, the kundalini are blessings. Such a relationship.

Another Bridget, she wants to break three of them from Columbia. But you see the ticket is quite a lot and all that. So I told her that we can pay for one. One is paid by Kamilo, I think and I don't know what is decided. And one is paid by her. It's like this.

Yogini: Kamilo is already there?

Shri Mataji: Kamilo is marrying this girl.

Yogini: Karina.

Shri Mataji: Good idea, yes. [Laughter] The right type of girls you have. She is going to go. She is going there to Columbia. It's not because you see when she goes away, then there will be no one. Though there's this pendulum, who else is there? Fernando is there, but she will be that sufficiently partial to do the thing. But if Kamillo is there.

Yogini: Then yes.

Shri Mataji: Kamillo is very sensible.

Guido: Did you show to Shri Mataji, her room?

Yogini: Not yet.

Guido: They would like to show you your room, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: What?

Guido: She would like to show you your room.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I'm honoured. I'll go and see it later. Nice to talk to you all.

Yogini: And this is the ring.

Shri Mataji: And who?

Yogi's: This is the ring.

Guido: The bell on the door. It's like a little bird.

Shri Mataji: Bird, I thought. [Laughter] Very nice meeting you.

Akbar: Good Evening, bye bye.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Look at these journalists. Americans must be feeling very bad.

Guido: You say you weren't feeling very bad..

Yogi: For me?

Guido: Americans.

Yogi: Oh, I thought I was thinking.

Guido: Don't tell journalists like this.Shri Mataji: Hello [UNCLEAR], how are you? Ah Beautiful. Cannot smell them? Ah nice. Thank you very much. [UNCLEAR]? Americans never had any the journalist in the New York but we had them down. I think in Los Angeles, Los Angeles we have.

Yogi: There was a journalist... in San Diego.

Shri Mataji: San Diego? Who's in San Diego? [UNCLEAR]. You think so?

Yogi: I'm trying to remember because it's only opened since I wasn't there.

Shri Mataji: Don't they even have television in Los Angeles, they did a lot.

Yogi: That's the tremendous work they did.

Shri Mataji: We had an agent. They said, without an agent you cannot do. So the agency came in. When they took us down and... a lot of photography. It's like something sellable. It's sellable, that they like.

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: What did she say? She's alright?

Yogini: She's surprised, confused, everything together but... And she's also in a hurry to go to the newspaper because she's going to publish it tomorrow. And she promised to come to the program tomorrow to see the details.

Shri Mataji: The one who has never known.

Yogini: Have you, she said, I don't know what happened, what happened.

Shri Mataji: That is the beginning she has offering.

Yogi's: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: They have never known, no? You see, there's no background. Like for Indians, there's a background. They know what happens when you get realisation. So they're not so frightened. And for people who have no background, in the beginning they start thinking.

Yogini: Because they don't know what chakras or...

Yogini: Because you told me something that I felt cold. Why? And I felt happy. Why?

Shri Mataji: No answer to that. Just with them.

Akbar: Shri Mataji, Gaya is living every day with your miracle. Every day. She's got a few miracles every day. She's living with miracles. She has to write a book about it. In a short time.

Shri Mataji: Now what is this supposed to be, Turkish? Turkish delight? What should I have for Turkish? Is it all right this one? It's fine. It's fine. Thank you. What is Turkish delight?

Guido: Very, very much.

Yogini: Delight in Turkish?

Shri Mataji: Well, they say Turkish delight is a kind of a sweet.

Yogini: Yes. Can I give my personal of the present to you? Because there is Turkish delight inside, maybe you have a chance to taste it. [Laughter]

Guido: Shri Mataji knew already.

Akbar: We have to open.

Guido: We all fall into these traps.

Akbar: You let me enjoy.

Shri Mataji: Ah, this is Turkish delight.

Guido: What's the name?

Yogini: Lokum.

Guido: Loko, loko.

Shri Mataji: Lokum.

Gudio: Lokum.

Shri Mataji: Lokum.

Yogini: Lokum.

Shri Mataji: Lokum.

Yogini: Lokum, with M.

Shri Mataji: Lokum.

Yogi: Loko.

Guido: Lokum.

Yogi: L, ou, m.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] This is from the protein of the wheat. Protein of the wheat.

Yogini: Yes, that's right, Mother, that's right. [laughter] Sorry, sometimes I make such a mistake.Shri Mataji: Miracles after Miracles. These people who came [to] India suddenly from Russia were surprised how are they here? They said we applied for a visa to go to Italy and they just refused. You can't go to Italy, you have to have an invitation from Italy. Such a short time you have to wait. So they met somebody in India there who is working in the embassy. He said come along and he gave them a letter. That means people are working here and if they want to go to Italy, they let them as tourists. So just I think till they started I think they went to catch the plane about say 9 o'clock or something in the night. They got the visa at 5 o'clock. 

Yogi's: Wow.

Shri Mataji: All right, then they arrived in Rome by plane and then they got into a train. Which brought them up to Florence. They didn't pay any ticket because the train was just leaving so they jumped into the train. They came to Florence, they said the train is leaving this last train, they jumped into it without paying a single pay. I was surprised to see them there. There was no talk about it when I was there. I was surprised how is it that they are saying that so how is it that they are saying that Indians have arrived from Russia. How can they come? It's very difficult to get any visa or anything. Russia had to apply for two months. So coming for India also they said we haven't got two months there and I told [UNCLEAR]. You are a Sahaja Yoga. All right you know everything works out. Yes, Mother, I said you do! Time has no place in our home. No words for time. Just do it. There's no need to organise too much, just... That Turkish delight. [laughter] How I asked her.

Guido: Mahamaya.

Shri Mataji: It is.

Akbar: She is going to translate you in the program. She was a little worried she wouldn't understand you all the time, she was worried.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no. Don't worry about anything. I will translate actually? Don't have to worry. [laughter] I mean you know that some of you were never speakers. How you have become speakers now? You see, no, no. So many of them had never gone on to the stage.Yogini: This will be the first time for me also in front of such a crowded people. 

Shri Mataji: Don't you worry.

Yogi: I was the same at the beginning.

Shri Mataji: There was one girl who got a realisation in Austria, she is here, what's her name?

Akbar: Erm, what was it?

Yogini: Edith?

Akbar: No.

Yogi's: [UNCLEAR]

Yogini: Yes, yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: She’s not good?

Yogi's: No, ermm.

Shri Mataji: She not such a Sahaja Yogini?

Akbar: No, she came for a few days and made a mess.

Shri Mataji: She is not so dedicated.

Akbar: She was for a little while in Vienna and she came in here and said I'm four years in Sahaja Yoga, start teaching the wrong, giving advice and we said ''If you want to come, you come just in [UNCLEAR]''.

Shri Mataji: Ah this happens. Like it's happening in Greece also. Sahaja Yoga gives you also ego to see, like I know Sahaja Yoga you see, so I get to the blessing. Sahaja Yoga is just an enjoyment, that's all. So simple. There's nothing to be so much concerned, worried, or to be boastful about it, just there. When you are not there, there is Sahaja Yoga. That is the assumption of Sahaja Yoga. So, supposing somebody becomes an officer or something higher, when he puts up his airs, and you can make out who's he, something great, because they must show off, and this. But in Sahaja Yoga, it's the other way round. You becomes so simple that a person starts wondering, what is this? That's what Sahaja Yoga is.

I was in India, I was doing all these things. You see in my husband's company, all these people, all these bureaucrats, all these rich people, they would have to know something and I would just keep quiet, never talk to anyone. Just watch everyone, like some plastic woman. So, one of them was one, Mrs. Singh, she was [UNCLEAR]. She was, her husband had got a job in London. So, another one, who knew her, she was a Anglo -Berman lady. She met her in a party, she said, ''It's nice, now you are in London, Mataji is going to be there.'' ''Which Mataji?''. She said, ''You don't know, Mrs. Srivastava?'' ''Which Mrs. Srivastava?'' She said ''This C.P. Srivastava, is tall man, his wife''. ''She is what? She's Shri Mataji? She is deaf and dumb? I have never heard her talking or saying anything''. ''She gives lectures''. ''She gives lectures? I can't believe it''. She just couldn't believe it. When she came to London, she asked, ''Are you Mataji?''. I said ''Supposed to be''. She couldn't believe it. That Mataji, I could speak or anything. I would give speeches, that was too much for her.

There's a saying, in sanskrit [UNCLEAR Aishwam pushaam, Mulang asti, kasantate vati shulaam]. One person was the virtue of doing something. It just benefits by itself. [UNCLEAR Nahi kasturi ka modaha, shapate namukha vati]. Smell the fragrance of the kasturi is a kind of a thing that is found in the Nabhi of a deer in Himalayas as kasturi [Deer musk]. You don't have to take a vow or you don't have to say that I take a vow, this is kasturi. Kasturi is kasturi with fragrance you know. If there is kasturi, the smell of a kasturi, everybody knows there is kasturi. You don't have to say that, no, no, I promise you I take a vow that this is kasturi. In the same a person who has got his virtues, shows by itself, real virtues. They, [UNCLEAR A-sham, Pu-sham] and this one is another one is that those who are realised souls, they are the one who are realised. For them it's not necessary to see the mirror. They know their reflections on other people.

Sanskrit is full of it because it is a spiritual level. It is a spiritual level, just deals with spirit. It is Sanskrit, it is a made holy and it says God's language. So there is, I have not seen anything vulgar or anything. Maybe somebody tried, they say so, to write something vulgar later on. But normally the whole of the literature is filled with it. And what is literature? It's called a [UNCLEAR sahita]. It's the one which has got hita in it. Hita is benevolence. The literature which has no benevolence, it is not a literature. Romance is not a romance if it is done with a woman who is not your wife or who is going to be your wife. Like that they have all kinds of proper scientific, also analysis, proper scientific. Like a mood is described now is a mood of bhakti mood. And what words to be used for bhakti mood? Supposing you are describing [UNCLEAR], what you call the chivalry and fighting. Then you should [UNCLEAR]. See these are the things you have to, to express it. So like that they have divided and said that if you use these words in your poetry, then it creates this kind of a mood, this [UNCLEAR]. Also for grotesque there are [UNCLEAR bibibhas], which describes all dirty, filthy things, you see. So also there is that. But what words, what letters to be used is also there is a science.

But when the kundalini moves on different chakras she makes this sound. And that sounds denoted now. I have given my lecture on this. What are the sounds created on different chakras?

Guido: Yes, we heard.

Shri Mataji: And all the vowels and all the consonants are there. The Vishuddhi chakra are all the vowels, Aa, Ee, Oo like 16 of them. So they make a sound and that sound they have heard it and seen it and also seen how it's written. At Agnya you can see the Aum written like that clearly. Now you have found out about this, I told you that you see the Mooladhara in the carbon. So you put the carbon atom, isn't it? They found it. So how it is written down, how it is sounding, everything is created by Kundalini. And the seers have seen it and they put it down. I mean that's the communication between the deities and between the saints. So the mantras also are based on how to raise their say Kundalini, what mantras to be used, what is to be said, you see. The kunjika has in it all this description, kunjika mantra. But it's said that there is no mantra, there is no word which is without a mantra. There's no root which is without the material root. There's no person who is not capable, [UNCLEAR]. What is rare is the one who employs it, your [UNCLEAR Jaka -Standradurlama]. The one who can organise it is the rare thing. Otherwise everything is there.

[Yogis whispering]

Shri Mataji: And the sound of sanskrit is very built in. Like this one I told you is like this, [UNCLEAR Amantram, Maksaram, Nasti]. [UNCLEAR Nasti, Mughla, Manavshadam. Aiyu, Gahapura, Shou, Nasti. Yo Jaka -Standradurlama]. It's very sweet I think.

Guido: Musical.

Shri Mataji: Built in. Same like Arabic also, Persian also has that. Even Latin has something sweet about it. Then the languages became very harsh I think later on. And there's no classification. I mean, I've seen recently some films made by these English people. Now that dealing says supposing they are doing some film about Egypt or something or they are doing something about Socrates or anything. They talk the same way as they are talking today, like journalists. I said this is not the way, any, anybody was talking at that time. But in the acting they have forgotten what to say. They have forgotten how to say it, you see. They are not saying the way they used to talk.

Even the ladies, you see, used to be very gentle. They would not throw their arms about and talk. So here you find, you see, a lady of those times, say Egyptian lady or maybe Greek lady or something, just like all English women talking like this, a queen talking like this, have you heard of? Because they are used to it, now they can't. They have become modern. I am writing a book now, first book will be not about Sahaja Yoga. Actually it is about Sahaja Yoga. Call us Para-modernism, that is Sahaja Yoga. First describe the Para-modernism, what is modernism, what is stupidity of it. Did you get that tape which we have sent it to Australia?

Guido: Austria?

Shri Mataji: No? Oh, these English should have given that. Very well done, very brilliant.That's what they said. But this Para-modernism, I have done three chapters, it's such little things, very beautifully written, very beautifully written. I was enjoying myself. So now, what's the second position of my... What's the order now? In your plan? You want me to see some film? For what? In English, what?

Guido: English.

Shri Mataji: English.

Guido: Aye, in English.

Shri Mataji: Where? In the house?

Guido: I don't know or outside?

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Yogi's: For Outside?

Shri Mataji: Outside?

Guido: You're maybe tired. I don't know Shri Mataji.

Yogini: If you are not tired, we can go to see Indiana Jones.

Guido: Indiana Jones.

Shri Mataji: Is there a film also?

Guido: No, no, it's Indiana Jones.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Guido: Indiana Jones. It's very adventurous.

Shri Mataji: Which one? I haven't seen that one.

Guido: You've never seen it? This is the third one of the series. It's very adventurous, very [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: All right.

Guido: One has two things about... And it's done by Spielberg, who is a realised soul.

Shri Mataji: We could see here also?

Akbar: Some film?

Shri Mataji: Yeah it's better. It's going to a cinema hall.

Akbar: Yes.

Shri Mataji: It could be good, it could be horrid. [laughter] Please, I think we do it here. But if you want dinner we can go out somewhere. But you can get the film now?

Akbar: Yes we go out, yeah.

Yogini: If we go to the way back, maybe?

Akbar: Yes.

Shri Mataji: You might also get some Indian film here.

Akbar: We heard Ankit was another Sahaja yogi, he said there are some Indian film also.

Shri Mataji: Must be.

Yogis: We will find. We will find.

Guido: Call Ankit?

Shri Mataji: So I think we'll have dinner and then see the film will be better. So where do we go?

Guido: You want to go outside Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Why not? I foot [pay] the bill.

Yogini: We go outside for dinner?

Shri Mataji: Yes but I foot the bill for tonight.

Yogis: No, no, no, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: One night I can do some time!

Akbar: Muslim country, you know the rule, rule, Shri Mataji. Muslim country.

Yogis: No, no.

Guido: You cannot go against the tradition Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] the tradition. I am the Mother. [laughter]

Guido: Mother is not supposed to pay.

Shri Mataji: Mother is supposed to pay.

Guido: Oh, absolutely.

Shri Mataji: What do you say, [UNCLEAR]?

Yogi: Mother says it's okay. [laughter]

Akbar: He's another architect, yes Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Akbar: Yes.

Shri Mataji: What, I would like you and him to go to Delhi, we are trying to do another house, and [UNCLEAR Harvan] was mad, I tell you. He was still, he was too complicated, went out. I said, [UNCLEAR Harvan], what's the matter? It's so simple, I'm telling you. Why can't you see? It's too complicated, Mother. I said, you are an architect. I'm not an architect. It's very simple, I said, it's very simple to do.

Hamid: Shri Mataji, how was the garden? How was the garden, you were there?

Shri Mataji: What?

Hamid: The garden in Pune? Garden in Pune.

Shri Mataji: Ah, you know, what we are doing there, that we are going to have, as it is we have done the garden so beautifully, you must see the photographs, you'll be amazed. They have grown so big already with your vibrations.

Hamid: Not in my life. [laughter] You have done everything.

Shri Mataji: They have grown so big, you know, but it's very mature now. All of them. But the only problem there is, we didn't know what are the trees like, what are these are, the names were funny, no?

Hamid: I can't identify, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: So you better come and see for yourself that way.

Yogini: That's another chance to go. [laughter]

Shri Mataji: But in Delhi house, we don't have so much chance, as we have there.

Hamid: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Delhi house is going to be like this, is that we are going to dig up a whole thing into a four and a half feet down. You dig up into what you call the basement. And the first floor is going to be four and a half feet high, so 9 feet with the basement. And the whole thing will be opened out, so the lawn and everything will be there.

Hamid: Underground.

Shri Mataji: Yes, under there.

[Yogis speaking italian]

Hamid: Shri Mother, I must tell you about pigs. The professor, they are doing, you have also shown you the picture, the photos last time as you are in it.

Shri Mataji: Ah, what happened to that?

Hamid: Shri Mother, the professor has caught me very frightened and has told me that the pigs  each drink from -drink this water drink, they drink less with this water. They drink 14 litres more than other parts which are not vibrated. And they are drinking so much, so much in the area. I don't know what we must do.

Shri Mataji: They drink a lot of water.

Hamid: A lot of water, too much water.

Shri Mataji: I tell you why, because of the water that you have given them, they have become realised. [laughter] And they must be absorbing all the heat from outside. Like Me, I drink a lot of water.

Hamid: Ah yes Mother.

Shri Mataji: They are absorbing heat and that's why they are drinking more water, more water.

Hamid: Yes, they are drink[ing] madly. Another thing is that Shri Mataji, He is writing. We should mix one time to all the vibrated, non-vibrated together, I'll take a sample. That is the statically we must do it. He has frightened the pigs, kill each other, but they don't know. They don't know, don't worry about it. I supported it, and if they kill each other, I [UNCLEAR], let me do our explaining, I [UNCLEAR] all day. The pigs are dying, and I [UNCLEAR]. And we are going the next week or the week after, we mix with each other, and they take a sample. I hope they don't kill each other.

Shri Mataji: They won't.

Hamid: They won't.

Shri Mataji: They won't. They won't, they'll kill each other. They'll never kill, try it. Why do they want to kill them?

Hamid: They don't know each other Mother. They are at different matters, at different matters. If they come together.

Shri Mataji: That doesn't matter.

Hamid: It doesn't matter I know, I know they don't want to kill each other.

Shri Mataji: Only human beings do like that, not the pigs.

Hamid: I think so. It's going very well.

Shri Mataji: They look so, so beautiful, you are so rich. So beautiful. And they'll be very soft, you know, in their inside.

Hamid: Yes, it is.

Shri Mataji: So what are you doing about them? I mean, pigs, what are they doing about the pigs there?

Hamid: Shri Mataji, we take the only blood sample and analyse the blood and we are trying to find something much changing in the blood and maybe later we are trying to find something changing the flesh. They are grown a little bit better. And if you have some success here, then we can continue with the vibrated further.

Shri Mataji: You know, in India I'm going to do that in Pune. Thinking of having a nice piggery.

Hamid: Yes, India is very nice.

Shri Mataji: And also for chickens, because the kind of chicken you have there is a hybrid sort of nonsense. But you see with these vibrations, you can have very nice chickens.

Hamid: I have thought in India, the Indian scientist is a little bit shy. We should maybe show them that it is happening something. When done, maybe they should show them. They are a little bit shy to try to come to publish.

Shri Mataji: In India everything imported is great. For them they think, we cannot do anything ourselves. It all has to come from outside.

Hamid: Yeah, yeah they can't [UNCLEAR] it but they don't know can maybe.

Shri Mataji: That's the trouble with [it]. And your trees? In the forest?

Hamid: Ah Shri Mataji, I couldn't go this time. Maybe after I go back, I'll try it.

Shri Mataji: What are people saying?

Hamid: They are the people, they are the forest manager.

Shri Mataji: What is it?

Hamid: They haven't seen Shri Mataji, we have arranged that they come one time with me, I'll show the difference. If they see the difference, it is nice, we can publish it.

Shri Mataji: If they survived.

Hamid: If they survive, if they don't see the difference, then we have to wait, maybe one year, that time, clear.

Shri Mataji: They are very different, [UNCLEAR] immediately. See now, can you imagine, in one year's time, is TM grown so big in Pratishthan? It's impossible, look at the rice we made. Out of sixty kilos, we made seven, three hundred kilos. Can't you tell? Nobody will believe. I told them, I'd put sixty kilos, just a half kilo in Pratishthan. I said, it is so. I'm telling you the truth.

Hamid: I see myself.

Shri Mataji: I said, beautiful rice. Last time you were there in Pratishthan, you ate that rice, that was from My village.

Guido: Would you like to have fish? Some speciality fish or Turkish?

Shri Mataji: Turkish food, because my husband has been praising it alot.

Yogini: They went home.

Akbar: The cinema is closed to...[laughter]. Mataji, this restaurant, it's cinema which is this movie is [laughter].

Shri Mataji: What is there?

Hamid: The restaurant is near each other.

Shri Mataji: There is the restaurant, there's the movie.

Yogini: Yes, they are close.

Akbar: The cinema is neighbour, next to that, the restaurant.

Shri Mataji: All right.

Yogini: Why do you want to be see Indiana Jones?

Shri Mataji: So first we see the movie, and then we eat our food. Which way? No, no, whatever. Film must be starting at the point.

Yogini: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: What time it starts?

Akbar: Usually, we can find out. Usually it's seven, half past seven, half past nine.

Shri Mataji: No, I have an Italian time now. What is your time now?

Yogini: Yes.

Akbar: Now it's half past six.

Guido: Six.

Shri Mataji: Correct?

Guido: Six thirty.

Shri Mataji: No, past five, so one hour.

Akbar: She is telling that after the movie, for the eating is late, so it's better we eat first.

Shri Mataji: And then go to the movie.

Akbar: And then go to the movie.

Shri Mataji: What time in the movie?

Yogini: It always changes [UNCLEAR], I don't know. We can check it.

Shri Mataji: Find out. Find out, check it.

Yogini: You see. Acquiring video, they are having issues. It was deciding to go to see this movie. It should happen. [laughter]

Hamid: It should happen.

Guido: Mother is taking the children to this.

Shri Mataji: When My children were small, I used to take all their friends to a movie. Will be sometimes twenty, sometimes ten. So one day a person saw me, some ladies and gentlemen were there and said ''Poor, this lady, how many children she has? [laughter]. But our children are very confident. Sahaja Yoga children.

Yogini: Yes.

Guido: That's so beautiful, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Imagine the Sukhanya, how sweet she has become.

Guido: Such a transformation. And that girl, Shri Mataji, yesterday on the stage.

Shri Mataji: They are so sweet, very sweet.

Guido: She said, you know Shri Mataji, I know English in Italian. [laughter] Victoria.

Shri Mataji: First with me, you know, every time she was saying something nice, very confident she was telling Me. I didn't follow what she was saying, but this was the best. They are very confident, that's the point, you see. That's the sign of a realised soul, so confident. And nothing stupid at all.

Yogini: No.

Guido: No.

Shri Mataji: She was asking me what's the significance of these bangles. I didn't know how to tell. I think I better take it out for tomorrow's program. Otherwise all their attention will be on the bangles. But they also used to wear bangles here in Turkey, I know.

Yogi's: Yes, they have many of, golden

Shri Mataji: But now, now they don't. They do?

Yogini: Golden bangles, yes they have.

Shri Mataji: One of the days to wear also glass bangles.

Yogini: Ah glass bangles? No, I haven't seen them.

Shri Mataji: No, they used to wear. Gold bangles they wear. I wish you were there, we distributed so many bangles.

Guido: It was such a festival.

Shri Mataji: Gold plated.

Yogini: That's Beautiful.

Shri Mataji: Very nice.

Guido: Big, huge dress, full of bangles.

Shri Mataji: Steel covered with gold, steel it was. And you see they were very strong bangles, so thin. Have you got any?

Yogini: No, they took it all.

Shri Mataji: You have it? You didn't get any. You had.

Yogini: The bangles, she had not used them.

Shri Mataji: No why?

Yogini: You didn't come up. You have this one, yes.

Shri Mataji: This one.

Yogini: Of course, of course.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]. All these, all these, we got them. Bangles and what else?

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: They are thin but very strong.

Yogini: These don't break.

Shri Mataji: Better have some, let her have some, few were took so let her have that, let her have this. So many bangles and what else did we have? Dresses.

Guido: Necklaces, dresses, knee rolls.Yogini: And also, kumkum house there, small boxes. 

Shri Mataji: Kumkum boxes are there. But for these leaders, I got -

Yogis: - Hats!

Shri Mataji: Beautiful Karaburi.

Yogini: Did you bring it with you?

Guido: No.

Shri Mataji: None of them have brought it. Like crowns, when I put it on. And then they started dancing. I was worried about...

Guido: She was just covering our ego. [laughter]

Shri Mataji: And they danced like children then. I was worried about the stage that it might break. Really, with that you also opened out.

Guido: They were all worried. I said, don't worry, Shri Mataji is sitting there, nothing will happen. So funny.

Shri Mataji: But you all became like children, I tell you, really.

Guido: It was so beautiful.

Shri Mataji: Everybody opened out so much. All the leaders were dancing on the stage.

Yogi: Wow.

Shri Mataji: Really wonderful.And the cap, also that thing was Karakul, you know, Karakul. What do you call that?

Guido: [UNCLEAR Colbug, Colbug].

Akbar: Wow.

Shri Mataji: Last minute I bought them, five minutes, last five minutes. It was, last was [UNCLEAR] Raga, [UNCLEAR] Raga. Last five minutes I bought sixteen I think, fourteen. Something like that. Eleven I had and three I got for Mr. Srivastava and My two son in-laws also. He also liked it, immediately.

Yogini: And the red dresses, Mother, the red dresses?

Shri Mataji: You like them?

Yogini: Were they from Russia?

Shri Mataji: Red dress, the one I gave for?

Yogini: For... Karen got one.

Shri Mataji: Ah, Caroline. That's from Russia.

Yogini: That's from Russia?

Shri Mataji: They are in a kind of a wool. A kind of a woollen knitted thing.

Yogini: With embroidery.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, that's Russia. But the dresses I gave you the otherwise, you see these frocks and things like that, they are from London, Debenhams. Five times they are cotton.

Yogini: Nighties and...

Shri Mataji: Nighties, I gave to Indian girls because they don't wear dresses, so nighties for Indian girls. Lots of things. More for women. You see, because what to get for men is a problem. We had, I forget, wallets, purses...

Guido: Wallets, pens.

Yogini: Necklaces, necklaces.

Guido: So many pens.

Yogini: Necklace also for women.

Shri Mataji: Necklace they are golden. That's for... what else?

Yogini: T -shirts.

Guido: T -shirts.

Shri Mataji: T -shirts, t-shirts, t-shirts. There were nice t -shirts, eh? Interesting.

Guido: Yes. And then yesterday, Shri Mataji was distributing all the silver coins. First to the musician, then painters, then Arichects then...

Yogi: Ball players.

Guido: Writers, poets.

Akbar: Wow, wow, wow.

Gudio: It went on and on. Eight hours Puja.

Shri Mataji: Eight hours Puja.

Hamid: The children were very happy, Shri Mataji.

Yogini: And then the T -shirts that had the squeaky... Disney? Donald Duck's squeaky T -shirts.

Guido: Donald Duck.

Yogi's: Children.

Guido: Donald Duck T -shirt.

Shri Mataji: Ah Donald Duck. You see, because of Mickey Mouse, this thing and Mrs Daisy, and it makes a sound quack, quack, quack, quack.

Yogi's: Yes, yes. All the children were making this noise.

Shri Mataji: All the children were on. [laughter] All was just... In one day I did all that shopping, can you believe it in one day? Except for the Russian, where we gave the rings and all that, Russian. But the rest of all that.

Guido: Well, I must tell you, when we went to Florence, hold on, it was too much. We went to, next to the [UNCLEAR Vomuomo], there was a place where all the artists are there making portraits and these things. So, Shri Mataji sat down and She was very shy. She didn't want to but She didn't but then we convinced her to have a portrait. And there was an Irani artist.

Akbar: Wow.

Gudio: Yes, Another Irani was doing the portrait to Mr. Srivastava. So, but at the end, Shri Mataji, we all found out. Shri Mataji first learned, I mean, it was not so expressing Shri Mataji's personality and qualities. And so she started herself doing the correction, explaining to him how to do it. [laughter]

Shri Mataji: Even Mr Srivastava.

Guido: And also Mr Srivastava, not only that, but at the end, Debuchaudari was there and he got a portrait by an Egyptian and he was not happy at all. So, Shri Mataji went to the artist and he started explaining to him how to do or what to do and these things. And then...

Shri Mataji: He asked Me. Another Artist.

Guido: This was completely confusing. So then Shri Mataji sat down and she started herself correcting all the paintings and doing it herself. [laughter]

Shri Mataji: And so much changed. He had spoiled it completely, with somebody else’s face.

Guido: So we all have to sign this design.

Shri Mataji: No, but the best part of it, then three persons came in. One from Egypt and two from Iran.

Guido: One from Iraq?

Shri Mataji: One Iran, one Iraq and one from Egypt.

Yogis: Egypt.

Shri Mataji: Three persons came, the artist. They said, give us the energy. So one of them said, the one who was Iraqi, he said, I don't believe in God. I said, all right, you ask the question, whether is there God or not? He asked three times and he got the word, but he says, now you believe in God. Then the two others, they also got realisation. So one Iraqi, one Irani and one Egyptian, three of them got realisation. The artist.

Akbar: Muslim eh?

Hamid: Shri Mataji, more Muslim, more Muslim, there should be more Muslim produce.

Shri Mataji: Yes, must be. Muslim's should be good because of one thing, because they believe in Nirankar.

Yogini: Nirankar.

Shri Mataji: They believe in the abstract God, [to] begin with. To believe in abstract itself. You see, because first you feel the abstract. See, first you feel the abstract. So it's easy to accept this fact that it's an abstract thing. Then in person. But if you start only talking about the personal God, then it shocks people to see how can you believe. But then it's Nirankar, formless, Parachaitanya that they can feel immediately. Then after that you can come to personal. First this is a very big hurdle and for Muslims it's very easy to accept, Ruh, they can accept this.

Hamid: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: So it should work.

Yogini: Where is Shri Mataji's room?

Shri Mataji: Oh these beautiful flowers are having vibrations.

Yogis: Wow.

Shri Mataji: But the fragrance you see the smell, I smell. In sitting, sitting, sitting, eating, eating, eating. No, no yesterday you don't know what these boys did to Me [laughter]. This is far enough. Where's the room now? Ha, what a kitchen you have eh? Beautiful. That's the bathrooms?

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Modern house and bathroom...

Yogini: Onyx. All Onyx.

Shri Mataji: Onyx, onyx.

Yogini: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Onyx, in here.
