AI GENERATED.

It's, uh, everybody has their own personality.

It's a very good sign. Uh Uh, that's a very good sign that you all keep your personalities and you don't merge into one personality. Uh, that variety creates all the beauty. You can see that how enjoyable it is to see the variety in people, and you should all maintain your varieties, your dresses, everything, the way you are. The change is inside, not outside. So the outside is very nice to have all these things, all this kind, and somebody should copy him also. All right, who are they? So it was nice to see the way you see different, different people, but I can see behind every personality, there's a background. Uh, there's a training, there's a. Life and Also I feel about People who Want to express themselves.

In a way they're more effective, that's what they accept. But sometimes, uh. Uh, be a little bit go beyond. Like, uh, I'll tell you an incident of Rustam's was that he told Rajesh that we should all become now Nir Nirvikiraka means without any form we should become formless. So I just said how do we become, he said, you ask mother, she'd make you all of us formless. So we were travelling by plane, myself, Rajesh, Rudi Jalan. Uh, you know, those people are very tall, hefty. And I said don't say all these things. It's wrong wrong to ask for to become Iraq and all that. So Rajesh was saying, but he said so we can ask for it.

We got down from the plane. We came out in the aeroplane. You see, everything was all right. We came out. It was all right, and there were 25 people who had come to receive us. They could not see us, none of us. We're trying to call them, Come here, come here. Nobody would listen to us. We didn't understand what was happening, you see. We had become Naka.

So we walked up to the driver and I gave him a bandance so at least he recognised us. We got into the car. These people said we couldn't see you. We had 25 people were there to receive. We couldn't see you. I said, now don't listen to Rustam and ask for such things as Nakar. Lots of interesting things happen like that, you see, and I told then, now don't ask for all these things from me because it's wrong. You see, you should ask now, Mother, make me such as jogi that I can bring 100 surjois to you like that you should ask. You should live in the present and not in the future. That's what it is.

Many people ask now what's going to happen to God's realisation? What is going to happen to this? When are we going to have this power? Now, this is a wrong attitude. In the present, you have to live. And together we have to move, and all of us have to know one thing that we have to just spread surgery. Nothing else but to spread a yoga, and we have to keep our personality all right intact and not need a car. We have to work very hard for that, uh, uh, for we have to go out, do all kinds of things, uh, think about it, what we can do, how we can spread serioga. All these things should be done, and we should not be lost because there are lots of temptations in er. The first temptation that is is money.

You might get money, you might get jobs. You will get married, you'll have children. Then you'll say, all right, I'll have my little house, live here, finished, gone forever. So all these things should be attended to and you must see to it that you keep your personality right, your nationality all right, your clothes all right, everything all right, but your personality must merge with the collective, otherwise there will be a big problem, and I respect all the people who keep their personality, keep to their nationality, uh, keep the way they are. Actually these days the situation is such that fashion starts, so people start cutting their hair fashion starts, they start making their hair funny. So in the fashion you can't even make out which personality one person is. It's better to dress up in your own personality in your own country way in the way you are, and it's very. Uh Beautiful to see diversity in that way, creating a beautiful unity among us. Uh, the personality as it is, you keep it, it's nice. I'm happy he has shown you there are certain personalities and all that, and when you see them.

You enjoy them and everybody is enjoying their laughing at themselves. It's a very big thing that you can laugh at yourself and appreciate it. It is a sign of real wisdom. Uh, now the last of all, I have to say that. Uh, on the whole, uh, some of you are, uh, singing beautiful songs. Together you can sing very well. And uh some of you are taking part into that music, but I would suggest that next time uh when we go to Ganpati play, let us have a proper uh book or something like that where all these. Songs are properly written down. And should be printed in a proper way so that everybody, even Indians can sing with you. See, they should have a chance to sing with you, but they can't read this Roman stuff.

So if you can give me, uh, I would like to write it down in Hindi language so everybody can read in India. We, I can't read Roman, very difficult for me and This will help them to sing together. Singing is one way we are very collective, eating together, living together, sleeping together. It is all very collective and the individuality and the different personalities that we see is very beautiful. On a validate We have to understand that we are all lights on the path of. The ascent of many people. We all should keep our light, light afloat, enjoyable. Uh, laughing at ourselves, uh, making fun of each other sometimes, pulling legs is all right, but in no way, no way it should be, uh, hurting another person is to say something, uh, on the physical side of it, especially one should not remark like somebody is a lame person or a blind person. You should never make fun of such a thing. Otherwise, a, uh, gait and the behaviour is very important to see.

And will be very much appreciated. Actually, I had never known so many foreigners as I call them. Uh, they are not my children. And when I go to different countries, I see different, different styles and different, different ways of their food, uh, their, uh, every habit is different. I really enjoy, uh, the way people eat differently and talk differently. It's very nice. But in all that we have to see the beauty how God has created so many human beings. Uh, so many faces, uh, my little, little small little cells, how he has changed the faces of people. Then every country has a different type of a face. Then every.

Even, even a part of the country we have a different type of a face. So all this is done just to create beauty and love, uh, in to show that even if we are all outside different inside we are one animals are all of them are, I mean, there's not much of a difference unless until you are very particular, you cannot find out one animal from another animal. If they live with human beings, of course, it is different, but otherwise if you go in the jungle, you can't make out one tiger one through another. It's all just the same, they look the same. But this differentiation has come in human beings and inside yoga when you grow more, the outside differences could be even more interesting, would be much more interesting, but the one sign I know about er is that their faces. Faces grow, eyes have a beautiful twinkling in the eye, and they are all all the time enjoy. That is what it is. We have to celebrate our own joy, our own virtue, our own righteousness, and all our styles. May God bless you. So now, so the last song is left out to sing it now, so we go.

Come on now. Now everybody's watching you and they'll copy you, all right? Be careful. Uh Thank you very much. Thank you. All chakras are already open. What are you going to do tomorrow? That's All right. So tomorrow, Puja will be at 12 o'clock. Actually, the Puja has to be in the night on Diwali, uh, but we'll have it about 12 o'clock.

I hope by that time you will have a nice sleep.
