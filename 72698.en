Mooladhara: Evening Talk
Public Program
New Delhi (India)
Talk Language: Hindi | Translation (Hindi to English) - Draft

This morning I was telling you that if we say that your mind is towards us, take it inside you, you cannot. I wanted to ask one more thing. Need I speak in Hindi or speak in English? Everyone understands English or Hindi. ‘Bete’ we speak in all. What to do, in this life learned English as well; Speak in Hindi, ok let's speak in Hindi.

For that some incident must happen inside, there must be something happening; I told you everything here, and one more thing, it is important that if the attainment of Soul and God is only to one or two people, selected people, and if the general public remain inaccessible, then it carries no meaning and neither God will mean any sense, nor will this world make any sense. This creation too is also not going to be meaningful. This achievement should be for common people, if general public do not get it but of very selected people, then the same situation will happen that happened to everyone. Those who lived like this were never recognized by anyone and what happens even by recognizing, just tell me; Take it there is someone wrong and is a King, then he is a king in his own house, what to us? We haven't got anything, we should also get something, then it has a meaning. So this incident must happen, not only this, it must happen in general, should be among more people, must happen among a lot of people. I told you about science, its ways, you something about electricity. The one who found out, if it is not used for common people, then what is the point of that electricity?

The achievement of Sahaja Yoga today is that Sahaja has been going on for many years. Ever since the creation was created, it has been created spontaneously. Like in a seed, there are sprouts that remain within the seed; everything remains inside it. All symptoms remain within it, as many trees emerge from within it; in the same way, the entire map of this universe is microscopic, already made, and all that formed, blooming, moving forward in a ‘Sahaja’ way. 'Sahja' meaning: ‘Sah’ i.e. With you, and 'j' means born; along with you this thing is born. And the way one or two flowers appear on the tree at first, but when the tree grows, sort of spring sets in, it gets laden with numerous flowers, bearing many fruits. Similarly, this Sahaja Yoga in our hands today is established in a new dimension. It is for the common people and not for the abnormal. Before this do it first with your mind; get rid first of your mind as to how we will do it brother; Are we even worthy of this or not, this incident cannot happen inside us. If you have already come with such a conversation in mind, keep it outside along with your shoes. This has to happen; this event is bound to happen. Whether it happens today, it will definitely happen tomorrow and we have to do it. And you do deserve it. Now how far do I wander in search of a worthy person? Meaning, if there is the best thing and you have worked only on it, what miracle did you do?

So the first thing is that, never think that this thing will not be done to us. If already there is any nervousness in this matter, throw it out because we will work hard and this thing will happen; now secondly the thing is that there is doubt that, Mother, who is she to do this and that we had heard that Kundalini awakening is a very tough task. That for stand firm on head, then after thousands of years it happens, everyone says this; don't know what all things have been written down. But this is not the case with us, it may be that we are an expert of it, it’s craftsman and know the work, that is why till date we have never seen that someone at some point said that Mother! Transcend us, and we didn't. All kinds of problems, big permutations, combinations, it has; it also has its problems because man has put himself in a very wrong way; it is not necessary that he is a bad man, he may be a good man, but mistakes are committed in ‘Dharma’. Bows heads at wrong places, recognize wrong people and such things happen. Men are Very decent, poor people; they are very decent men, there is nothing wrong, they got in trap, did something stupid and what! And because the powers of Satan are so much active in Kalyuga, children hardly escape from its trap, don't they?

We have awakened the Kundalini of thousands, and can do yours too, there is no doubt about that. But if we can do; for you to be angry with us for this, there is no need. Today morning I had told that if I am its artisan I can do it; if you are its artisans and if someone says to cure this, we cannot do it; doesn’t mean that we are inferior, nor do they get superior. If you ask us to run this, we can't run it. You will teach us seventeen times; we are not able to. So we are useless in this matter. But the ones we know, we know the work, we do it and have done it and it can happen to you too. Therefore, sit down with such preparation that it has to happen, it is our right, and this event will happen, and it is for all common people. Only be prepared for it. If at all there is any guilt, do tell us; if some precautions need to be taken, do tell us, or if you have messed up your abstinence, about that too you will have to say about that also; so people get annoyed in petty things.

Humans are also strange. If I tell you, for me, you get me Rupees three thousand, it matters not to you. You will bring it and immediately give it; but I would say, son! this is a bit wrong, if you leave it then you will feel very bad. Will go, will leave the pandal immediately. So we are Mothers; we have to tell a little bit too, don't feel bad about it. First thing; the other thing is that this involves settling. Today you people have come, some people came in the morning, they have come again; in Sahaja Yoga there is a need to settle. As there is a plant and it has a living process, it needs to settle down. Firstly, as the seed germinates, everything is very tender, it needs to be cherished and handled; then when the tree is well established, then no matter how strong the wind blows, whatever problems may occur, no matter how much storm comes, it has no fear. So this should be known that after getting it, it is necessary to settle down. The third thing is also that many people became very used to listening to speeches. A ‘Sahib’ had come, who I think does Gurus shopping. I asked him, he is visiting all the gurus, came to me as well, carrying his bag. Guru’s shopping is on, let's do something here too. So here the matter is different. You can't do any shopping here; I get contented only from lectures; speeches are fine, in that also I am making your Kundalini dance and raising it, and until you transcend, I won’t have satisfaction. And you also stuck in this mess, why not attain realization? After all, that is what we have to achieve, we have to know only that, but Sahaja Yoga does not suit because people want to give money to Mother, do something this or that like this, take leave; all Gurus do this. Well, you can't pay money to Mother here.

You can't win your mother until you transcend and get set in it. These are two things; people don’t want; they think that it is a matter of very hard work. At the time of transcending, you need not incur any hard work, not at that time; after attainment, you have to settle down and need to settle, the time has come. This is the call of time, and in this call of time, if you do not self-awaken, then later it will be very difficult, that I will tell you; the second thing is that people do not settle in Sahaja Yoga, after that they get diseases, then later they come to me and say, Mother, please cure us.

After coming into Sahaja Yoga, people have closed the doors of doctors; don’t visit their houses; it can be fixed by all means. But there is one thing that after knowing self, you need to get into yourself, harmonise self; and all your full strength. should be used. Sahaja Yoga is not for such people; whoever is mother's courageous son, the same will get from Mother. This I may tell you first, you don’t mind it. Tukaram has said, 'Marathi- Ariya Gabalayache Kamnohe Hoi'; someone who is of ‘Patti’ can enter get into Sahaja Yoga.

Now I will tell you a little about Kundalini. So now we are here for five days, and in five days, we will tell you completely about Kundalini. From tomorrow, do bring some paper and pencil so you can also make notes of all that I am telling you. Firstly, so you can see here in front of you, this God has created within us a complete instrument. Now the instrument, as we see the worldly things, it is not like a dead instrument, it is live; and which is called Surti, that’s Kundalini. After all, that we the human beings are active on the strength of something or the other. Look at this fire; it is such an amazing thing, how efficient is the movement etc. of the entire body; the whole creation of the universe, how beautifully it is carved. All these things, there are certain powers that are secret; they are secret because the gross attention that we have, the inanimate mind that we have, cannot understand it; for that, there should be subtlety. And to acquire this subtlety, Sahaja Yoga aims at. To descend into this stillness is the goal of Sahaja Yoga that is self-realization, recognizing the soul.

As I told you today morning, without knowing ‘Atma’, spirit, your illusion cannot be broken, and you cannot know God. Whatever you know about that is just knowledge, not realization; realization happens only after knowing the ‘Atma’, hence the ‘Atma’ will be known first, only after that everything will be understood. Now this Kundalini, let me explain this complete instrument. And then I also tell you where the Kundalini is. First of all, this that you see in the left hand, from the right-hand side of the head the power that passes through our inside and descends on the left-hand side, our existence is due to this power. This is a subtle power; we can’t see it, from our head this comes and passes through our spine and reaches down. It is not visible to the eyes, but when realization occurs then I will be able to show you each power. The nerve that carries this power we people call it Ida Nadi or Chandra Nadi.

When this subtle power manifests itself externally, when it gets expressed, its manifestation takes place, then our left sympathetic nervous system is formed from this; it is responsible for our existence, this is power our existence. And when this power extinguishes, then we die. Hence people call this power also called ‘Sanghark Shakti’; in Sanskrit, this power is called Mahakali Shakti. There are no words for it in English because this thing has not been explored in English. As to what are its undercurrents? Sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system, what are their undercurrents, science has not explored yet. So for this, if I say the power of Mahakali, there is no need to make a big fuss. We people are not English. And the other power inside us, that passing through the left hand and comes on the right-hand side, it is called the power of Maha Saraswati. With this power, we do body movements etc., physical. activities and intellectual activities, mental activities. You people do not differentiate between left and right sympathetic in medicine. Are able to apply, but these are two things; Left is your emotional side and right is your mental and physical side. There is no difference in medicine, because of this reason people understand diseases like diabetes doesn't come; I will tell you how imbalances come, and imbalance can be understood only by understanding the difference between these two things. It turns out that one pulse moves more, one moves less, and the other moves less. Because of that, he gets diseases, and the one that moves more aggressively, by reason of its aggression occurs.

The sense of imbalance comes when you can see its two ends. So the power on the right side, the nerve that’s carrying it is called Pingala Nadi. People also call it ‘Surya Nadi’. Due to this, the right-sided sympathetic nervous system gets manifested. The one that you are seeing in the middle there is a ‘Nadi’ nerve, this nerve is called Shushmana Nadi. This nerve, so far this exists within us, means it manifests the entire sympathetic nervous system. The same element has reached the world.

Now whatever we have achieved till date in our transformation, in evolution from the state of amoeba to the state of human, all that is there in our central nervous system. Understand it that our central nervous system is a reflector of all this. It is in our conscious mind. The Ida Nadi of the left-hand side invigorates our dormant conscious, means it invigorates sub-conscious or makes it work; as you are hearing something from me just now, this you are hearing from the conscious mind; but this talk goes into your dormant conscious. This is the work of the left-sided nerve; that whatever conversation it listened, immediately stored in the sub-conscious. Hence, people call it conditioning; it can be of two types, may be cultured and can also be un-cultured. Now people like Fried saw only bad values, his eyes – it means the way of acquiring knowledge of these people; it's like it's a dark place, came, whatever one got in hands sat down with that, this is the truth.

Object thing that’s called another way; light is switched on, you see all. This is the way of Sahaja Yoga; and that way of getting such knowledge by listening, science or any such other blind way to get it; then with that way when the exploration was done, since Farite Sahib was already blind, and I think he himself was also a strange mentally indifferent person. What all dirty things people talk about him. He caught hold of this one and worked on this and he started saying that whatever, in this way, you ask someone not to do this, don’t do that, do not do this, do not do that, this results in conditioning; due to which man does not remain free; but he didn't think that if a person is not forbidden from one thing then his other nerve will strengthen. The first ‘Nadi’ generates the superego; the first ‘Nadi’, that’s ‘Ida Nadi’ generates superego from conditioning and the other ‘Nadi’, that’s of ego which is on the right-hand side, that develops ego; first, you become a government servant.

‘Sahib’, so you don’t talk to anyone properly; some people went to meet the Minister ‘Sahib’, there one gentleman was very impatient. The poor villagers asked what’s the matter. He said don’t you know that I am P.A. [‘PIYE’ in Hindi means drunk]; they said that had you told us in advance that you are drunk, why would we talk to you? So this Ego ascends. This has been not understood. by Frite Sahib that when you cut the left side, the other side will rise. And ego will swell onto the skull super ego. Like this, ego and superego are there in our heads; now let me explain ego and super ego a little because you people are not of any psychologist, by God's grace. In psychology, it has also been accepted.

Ego and superego, understand that a small child is drinking his milk from his mother, sitting in bliss, in bliss. If now his mother picked him up and if she wanted to take him to the other side, his ego gets awakened that why did she do it. So his mother scolded him saying, "No son, don't do this." So his super ego got awakened. Like this, a balloon-like thing, like ego and super ego accumulates in our head. Ego from front to here and the super ego from behind like this. Now when both of them, after coming, settle down here properly, only then this part of the head, that’s the part of the fontanel bone, becomes calcified, gets absolutely solidified; then the palate gets filled, then it happens. Then you become 'you', you became 'you'; all left behind, all separated, everyone has their own shells like eggs have shells; similarly, humans too form shells. They get so formed so that within it, a human may fully recognize his freedom and utilize it properly.

After using it, they will understand which thing is right and which is bad. However, on man, it’s not entirely left. Many great saints took incarnation in the world and explained to you that this is the religion, don't do this, do this; were they all crazy? We people categorized them as different castes and side-lined them. From morning to evening, just greet them and over. In our lives, it is useless for us to listen to them.

After all, why did he say that, why did he say this? Don't do this, don't do this; by doing this, this will happen, by doing that, this will happen, because we are very intelligent, no! We will know everything through science. What is science? It’s a very small part; what can I tell you? I will tell you that too. All that you know from science is how small a part it is; it’s a very small part. The five elements that pass through your Pingala Nadi, which are about the Panch Mahabhutas. You just know about them; as there is gravity inside the Earth, but why is it there, how is it? You ask a question, why did we become humans from amoeba, what is the reason, if we are making it, then a man will ask, why are you making this?

After all, it shall have some meaning, why did God create us! Today a biologist had come, he said, “I do not believe in God.” I said, I am surprised at you that if a biology person does not believe, then that’s done; the rest do with the inanimate elements. At least those who are biologists should think how beautifully God created man, and it was created in such a short time that even big biologists are astonished that just by love chance man couldn’t be made; at the most, one amoeba would be made. Then upon us, this responsibility God gave to us. He gave us freedom to freely know what is good or bad. And when in our freedom if God be called by us, He gives you this bless that you also know him. In this way, this machine was prepared and it was set, but unless you connect it to the mains, till then what meaning does it carry? Cards are made inside this; in the same way, the card that was created inside you, that is Kundalini.

God has already created you; you have not to do anything; you don't have to do any hard work. Like a seedling, there is a primula; in the same way, God has planted primula within you, the same is Kundalini, which is in the triangular bone. Now the gap, you see, in the middle, this gap is also present in the central nervous system of humans.

This gap is that the ‘Atma’ in his heart, the spirit in his heart; the gap thus formed is this gap. The spirit inside us. Yes, that's the gap. The soul within us, it knows; it’s regional, but in our central nervous system it’s not there. Means, it’s not in our conscious mind, meaning that we have not known it; it knows us; so this gap that is there, it was created because Kundalini has to rise from within this; The same incident that I told you about happening, Kundalini awakening is that incident; But this mechanical thing, which you should not consider dead, is a living phenomenon. Such as a primula emerges from a seed, alike it is a living thing. Man has till date haven't done any living work, have you? Pop out a sprout from a seed; A tree died, you erected a pillar, you became a great man; this you are just changing the dead, whether make a chair or make something out of it. Then he started sitting on the chair, so the chair sat on the head and can’t sit down and have been tight; look at behind you people sitting there, can’t sit on the ground. Such situation has come, it’s slavery started.

What benefit did you get from this dead work? You explore all the dead elements; You should find out the living element, how it happens? How does a seedling grow into a big, massive tree, would you be able to find out this? Thousands of such things all around you see; you say, “Yes, it’s like this.” This is how it looks like; But how does that event occur? This is a very subtle phenomenon; you cannot see it. You know that many voices are of such high frequencies that you can’t hear. The condition in which man has been created, in this condition he cannot know this subtle thing. But he has been so created that he can know that too. Only a human being can know; in man itself such a brain is specially designed which is triangular, in which all these happenings occur; inside it are Ego and Superego meet in this way and Kundalini keeps sitting in the human in this way. Now you think that The entire universe was created, the earth was specially created, vegetation was created in it, Created and then created you and created specifically for you and all such things were kept in it and only you have the right to Know God and embrace His Power Carry from within. This is your goal, your fulfilment; Until the power of God comes from within you, you don't make any sense, you don't mean anything and so does the whole universe mean nothing. This is to happen and all that happening today is also historical thing. Coming of all in the world, step by step, is important; I will tell about it tomorrow how every great incarnation and those whom we call prophets, that we call Guru, how did they come into this world and what did they do in our awareness, in our consciousness and where do they reside within us, I will tell you all that tomorrow.

This Kundalini is present here in the triangular bone or not, even this much people do not know; and on Kundalini, write such huge books, tell me what should I do? In such big books it is not even known where Kundalini is; We can make you witness this, you can see its vibration with your own eyes; whether you are transcended or not you can see its vibration; You can see the rise and fall with your eyes; Hey! Just like yours, just like your breathing is going on, like that the breathing of the Kundalini will be visible. Triangular bone If we look below, at that time the Kundalini will be seen growing like this, you see, see with your eyes. We also made a film about it. When the Kundalini rises, its vibration commences, but some are so good people that spontaneously find it on top, it’s not visible in them; whose Navel ‘Nabhi’ Chakra will have catch, the ‘Nabhi’ Chakra, that’s there, when it has a catch there, then the Kundalini will be visible; Not only this much, you will also see that when Kundalini rises; Take it that your liver If there is a problem then you will see that there is pulsation on the side of the liver. You will see it with your eyes. If you use your stethoscope, you can see it where its rising? At the end, it reaches there, which Kabir said, 'Shunya Shikhar Pe Anharad Baji Re' Its pulsation is felt; 'Anharad' means pulsation occurs, then Only when it opens the pulsation stops and the power, that’s omnipresent which you do not know in its subtleness; That rears and endures every leaf, every flower, every fruit and every human, in care of that power, ‘Shakti’ you become one. So far you have not known so you won't be aware of it, just read and read about it, you haven't realized it yet. Must be aware of it, without realizing it everything has settled. happened, you already started doubting it; Hey brother! in this what is there to doubt? Haven't people written about this before? Everyone told; But now the time has come for everyone to get, so everyone has to get it. Needed; But everyone will accept it, I also know it. There are many reasons of it, there are many reasons of it; Now these centres, these chakras, these subtle centres are made inside us. These centres within us reflect the steps of evolution that has taken place within us. These are stages; first when we were carbon, so this is the first Chakra which belongs to Lord Ganesha. After that, when Brahmadeva created the entire universe, then second Chakra is there which is of Brahmadev, this is Swadhishthan Chakra, that too is within us, only due to which we can create the universe; Because of that only we plan, think.

After that is Nabhi Chakra. From Nabhi Chakra, you know that for being Human from fish whatever has happened, has taken place in this lap only. To help us in this, there have been great Gurus within us, whom you know, from Socrates to Confucius, Moses, Raja Janak, Mohammad Saheb, Nanak Saheb, all these whence became great Gurus, all these Gurus worked hard on this and created the religion of man. The Human religion is inside the stomach; His religion is not outside; As this Gold has its religion, it doesn’t go bad, it is Untarnishable. In the same way the ten religions of Human remain in his stomach; If a person becomes oblivious to this religion then his Kundalini does not rise, Brother! these religions need again be fixed. The Kundalini, herself needs come, fix them, care for them; only after that the Kundalini rises, so suction happens, and whatever this work, it’s done by the Kundalini, you do not have to do anything. Effortless; You were born, what efforts did you make, or a tree emerged from the seed? What efforts did the seed do? which books did it read? Similarly, when this is a live activity what an effort you need to do, effortless. Sahaj means ‘Effortless’ and has come from ‘Sahaja’ word, it means born with you.

This Right to Yoga is born with you because you are human; It’s your birth right that you attain this Yoga; through this you know God, it is yours right. But you yourself do not want to use your rights, What God may do? Now there are these subtle Centres; If you attain these Centres and if you can awaken them then your health will even otherwise be fine. There is a disease, take it, what is called multiple sclerosis; those doctors, they say it can’t be cured, we say that in Sahaja Yoga it will be cured. It will be hundred percent absolutely cured. In this we see three Chakras that are bad: Mujadara Chakra, Navel ‘Nabhi’ Chakra and Agnya Chakra. If these three Chakras, if we set right, it will be cured. When you explore a thing from outside; take it that there is a tree, it got a problem. Now from outside, even if you have done something right in it, then some betterment may occur; but if you know to fix something from its root then the tree will be fine. Just like this cancer disease; cancer disease also results due to your sympathetic nervous system, due to its excessive usage, either emotionally or you use it to the extreme for other reasons, sometimes irritation occurs, sometimes infection occurs; for any reason, the sympathetic emergency, that remains on you. If always there is an emergency in your life like the potato of emergency, the same thing happens to the human being. At that time your parasympathetic, which is there, keeps fixing your cancer all the time; you get cancer every day. Means, you use it daily and it is the parasympathetic that keeps fixing, balancing itself, which is the Sushumna Nadi in the middle. But as this is left side and right side, now the left side’s sympathetic and the right-sided sympathetic, both these are fully working like this; when these break, the gods inside them also fall asleep. Then malignancy occurs. A cell that is there starts growing a lot; it infects the other one and that too starts growing. It gets related by the contact, not to the whole. Out of the whole body, one single starts growing arbitrarily. Cancer has occurred. If we awaken this Deity, the cancer gets cured; now whether there are gods or not, people will say why believe in gods, whether there are gods or not? Now after Sahaja Yoga, you will see for yourself that things get better when you take their names. So there are gods; they will be seen only after Sahaja Yoga. But we can explain it mentally also.

As adrenaline and acetylcholine are two chemicals; take it that both these are absolutely dead chemicals, but they behave strangely in our body, no one understands; they say we cannot explain their mode of action. Means, they are honest people, all scientists aren’t liars, but they have their own decorum, they have their own limitations, telling according to that that we cannot tell that at some place it augments and at other places it relaxes. It's not understood that the same things these Deities do inside us. If any foreign matter enters our body, then the body efforts to expel it out of it. But if the foetus in the stomach, which is a child, being a mass, settles, it’s not thrown away; it is cared for. It's nurtured, it is looked after. And when the time comes, it is thrown out on time. The work of Lord Ganesha, that is performed by Lord Ganesha. The element of Ganesha does this work within us.

Now doctors will not believe in Ganesh ji, they will keep photos in their house, Nanak ji's photo will remain. Ganesh ji's will remain, all will remain; but Ganesha resides in our Mooladhara Chakra. Not understandable, what should I do? Tell me how to teach them? Now the girl with sclerosis who came here on the stage in the morning, I just told her to chant Ganesh Mantra right in front of us; she became alright, but you will say, ‘It can’t be.’ But if you say so, it is not going to happen. Because you should have the authority to awaken Shri Ganesha; but if you get transcended, then you too will get the right. When you are a citizen of Delhi, whatever are the rights of Delhi, then you are fully entitled to. If you become the citizen of God’s kingdom, then what Ganesh ji and what Hanuman ji? All stand in front of you with folded hands and tell us what is your work to be done? Say.

Now this thing is true or not, you should investigate and see. First, come into the kingdom of God; this is the first thing, otherwise you are not its citizens; you are of the Government of India. Stay in their efficiency; we are saying that you come under the Government of God and then we will tell you; then see where your powers reach to, then leave aside cancer, no disease will touch you. You will cure others' cancer, but without realization, we cannot talk about anything. The point is to first get transcended, only then you descend into the subtle. When you descend into the subtle, you will control it yourself. You can control that thing yourself which is controlling the entire creation because this is omnipresent power, ‘Shakti’; as soon as you are in it, it starts flowing through the central nervous system, your heart; its vibrations start flowing through your central nervous system. You get vibrations in your hand, the cool breeze. That’s called ‘Chaitanya Lahariyan.’ When this starts flowing from inside you, it means the spirit flows from within you. Then it seems that whatever you do, you are doing it in the kingdom of God. It is important for a human being to have this. Then I don't even have to say that you quit alcohol or quit smoking, nothing; we must have to leave, we do leave, because when inside you start enjoying, then who will enjoy outside?

Now whoever, sitting here, were drunkards; all the people sitting there at the back were hard drunkards. What drunkard, who may send you guys to hide-outs, of this kind? Like this, these used to take drugs; abandoning everything, today they are having fun, it happens automatically. In that, there's no need to say anything else when you start to get inner happiness. All external things automatically fall away; I don't even have to say anything special! Like a small thing: if you want, you can take it from the dirt, take it from the dung; an animal doesn’t feel foul odour. But if you take a human, he does feel it, right? In the same way, when you enter the Kingdom of God, your consciousness becomes so that you can’t tolerate it. You will feel a burning sensation like in your hand; you can't bear it; by itself, the thing is abandoned.

So, whatever the problems are there, everything gets swept away. Everything automatically falls away from you. I won't have to say anything in that; everything will happen automatically. Today I have given you an introduction about Sahaja Yoga. That is, I will tell you all the deep things, I have said that the subtler, the subtlest of it. I have knowledge, I will tell you all that; I am ready; this is all knowledge, everything else is ignorance. Things will work out at your fingertips. You first of all know yourself! You are not recognizing your power and are sitting confused. So far your motor has not started yet; start the motor at least, then you will know. Prior to that, you are doing other work. One thing; it's a small thing. So the first thing is this, and happening of this event; the other thing is to settle down; and the third thing is to know the full knowledge, which chakra is where, in which way the chakra is made to act, how to fix it. There are only three steps of this Sahaja Yoga; once you do this, then you become a great Sahaja Yogi and right sitting do your own miracles and of others too; and enjoy! Because your Power, ‘Shakti’, will keep on flowing from within all the time.

Do you understand? Does everyone understand or not? Is there still a question in the skull? If there is no question, then now after this we will all go into meditation. I'll be back in a minute or two, you guys. Just loosen your waist a bit, take off your tie, etc., because ‘Vishuddhi’ chakra is getting caught. And sit lightly. Very light, we are not Guru or something. We are your mother. You are everything to us, and we are yours, Mother! Loosen up a bit your body; yes, socks if you want, so do it; there is no harm, some nylons, etc., thing it may have, isn’t it? Do as you like.
