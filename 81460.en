 (England)
I can tell you a small little thing. It's in this country, actually. Shri Mataji was living near the airport and we had been to see her. I don't know if I was alone or with the children, but Malcolm was at work. So I told Mother that, by Her grace, Malcolm was doing well. He had a company car, but his company was sending him to another place called Luton, and I really didn't want to go so far.

But Mother said, "No, you should always go wherever the husband goes." So I said, "Oh my God." He was looking for a house over there, but then we would have had to sell this house or rent another one, and it was just too many things happening. So afterwards, I think he stayed there, but the advice was that you have to go where the husband goes. That was very good; she told me that as well.

She's on a tape where she talks about how to have a happy marriage, and it does work. This was in Australia, and I think it was 1979. It's a very good tape. It's a Nabi tape. And she says on it... she does it so charmingly, doesn't she? We have tried that in our marriage, and it absolutely works. It's wonderful advice, and it's so simple.

Can you give us an example?

Well, I wasn't all that young when I got married, and I was quite set in my ways, and so was my husband. I had lived alone, and I was used to going out in the evening, walking around the streets. It's a very funny thing to do, but that's what I used to do in the evening—just go walking around. I live in quite a nice area, and there are some beautiful doorcases and some nice buildings. So that's what I used to do.

Anyway, David would come home from work, and I'd say, "Oh, I'd like to go out for a walk." He'd say, "Okay," and he walked around the streets with me, looking at the doorcases and the buildings. He did that for three weeks, and then I didn't want to do it anymore. I've never forgotten it. I've always remembered him doing that. He's such a darling, sweet person. We've always tried to do that: to do what the other one wants. And that's the way to be happy.

So when you see everybody getting divorced all the time, you think, well, try that. Try Mother's advice. It’s simple. It's just love, really, isn't it? To care about what the other one wants. And then you can be as set in your ways as you like, and you can still come out of it.

I also feel that all of Mother's talks transform you, just as she said, and I can see it in practice. For instance, with these Sahaja Yogi children—of course, my daughters are now 26 and 24. I'm surprised. The other day, just a couple of days back, there was a little something between us about an event I wanted to attend. So Sakshi and Smita just said to me, "Do you know what, Mummy? Maybe we have been born to correct you." To correct me! And that's why they've been born.

And I'm surprised when they talk. Sometimes it's funny. They have such knowledge that they can really correct you in such a subtle way and make you realize that what you're doing is wrong or something like that. She told me, "Mummy, all men are the same, you know. They are like babies." And I said, "My God."

Even when she was small... when I was expecting her, Mother had told me that a big soul was coming, taking birth on the earth. She told me or my brother, but I know that much. And even when she was nine years old, she had told her cousin, whom she had not seen for a long time—he had come because she was in Dharamshala—she had told him, "Do you know what? I've seen God. I've seen God. And that's why we are studying there, because that's God's place." And the cousin was saying, "Where's this God's place?" and all that. So she said, "Mummy, come here. Give realization to this boy." And both the boys, they were sitting like that in meditation. And she was only nine years old. And afterwards, the boys said, "Oh, now we want to go where Sakshi and Smita are going, to Dharamshala." That means these realized souls, they are really different. It's amazing.

Did you get advice from Shri Mataji about children, how to bring them up?

It was very simple advice. She just said, "You discipline them, and I'll give them the love."

When my daughter was young, she told me how to put oil on the taloo [soft spot on a baby's head], so that it has to be filled, because you don't know how to bring them up. And she said, "You have to put the oil this way, and then rub it towards the middle," and she showed me how to do that sort of thing for the baby.

When we went to a meeting, Gowri had just been born, and Mother stopped when she went out, put some attention on Gowri, and said, "How is she?" She had a little bit of a cold, she was a bit blocked up, and I told Mother that. She said, "What you need to do is oil her head." And suddenly a hand with oil came out of the crowd somewhere. So she oiled Gowri's head right there, exactly what you were saying. I just remember seeing Mother's face being very big, and just the real wonder of Mother there.

What about the children? Did you have any sort of advice on day-to-day activities?

No, not at all.

One day, when she came to Bushy Park, which was the ashram in Bristol, I was taking Lakshmi past Mother's bedroom door, and I hadn't put tights on her. I knew that Mother would say she should have tights on, so I tried to sneak past the door. And just as I was going past, Mother said, "Ruth? She should have tights on."

And she would ask what you were giving her to eat. I just had Lakshmi then, so if I was giving her something, she’d ask, "What have you put in there?" Lakshmi had a little cardigan on, and she said, "Where did this come from?" I'd actually bought it in a charity shop. And then she said, "You should knit for her yourself. You should knit for her." She doesn't like children or babies in wool, does she? No, because the vibrations can't flow when they wear the fleece all joined together.

Also, I remember she mentioned that when the babies are small, I should give them kichdi [a dish of rice and lentils], and that's very good for them.

I'm sure there's loads more. Is there anything else that's just there inside you that you want to share with us?

One funny story, I suppose. When we were at Brompton Square, I was up on the roof of a house overlooking the garden next door. It was springtime, and there was this magnolia tree in the garden. I was admiring it, and I wondered how long it had been there, because it was quite developed, and how much the person who planted this tree had actually paid for it. There was a public meeting that night, and during the course of the lecture, Mother said, "When you see a beautiful tree, just enjoy it. Don't stand there asking how long has it been there, or how much did it cost." It's difficult, because all your things come out in cinemascope.

I remember sitting at her feet once, and I said, "Oh, it's wonderful being with you, Mother, but it's awful as well." She said, "Yes, that's what it's like with Mother."

And she sometimes has a way of reflecting back to you little nervous habits that you have, so that you see them yourself. I had a habit of saying, "you know what I mean," after I’d said something to people. So I said something to Mother, and then I said, "Do you know what I mean?" And she said, "No. No, I don't know what you mean."

I was addicted to sunbathing, and I had a horrible lesson. I've never sunbathed since. We were in Switzerland, and I went out for a walk in the hot, sunny afternoon. I thought, "I'll go down to the lake, and I'll sit under a tree." But you had to walk in the sun to get down to the lake. But I thought, "Oh, no, when I get down there, I'll be in the shade, everything's okay." I came back, had a little rest, and looked in the mirror. "Yes, nice sort of pinkish-brown, looks nice, sparkling eyes."

So I went into Mother's room, and she said, "Oh, Baba, what have you done? What have you done to yourself?" Shouting. Terrible. Then she shouted and shouted, and she got her son in. "Look at her face! Look what she's done!" Anyway, she said, "Now, tomorrow you're not to go out."

So the next day came, and I didn't go out. I sat inside. That night, in those days, they weren't always very kind to the people who accompanied Mother, and I had to sleep under the kitchen table. I was bitten by mosquitoes all night. The next day, the whole side of my face was covered in these lumps. We were all going out for the program, and she came down. She said, "Aren't you coming?" I said, "No, Mother, you told me not to go out." She said, "Yes, it's all right, you come."

So I was sitting in the front of the car, and she was behind, so she must have seen the side of my face. "What's wrong with your face?" she said. I said I got bitten by the mosquitoes. I never sunbathed after that. That was a horrible lesson. You get shamed in front of everybody.
