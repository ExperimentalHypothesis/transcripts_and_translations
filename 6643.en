Public Program. Moskow (Russia), 6 August 1993.

Scene 1

Shri Mataji is seen getting down from the aeroplane followed by Sir C.P at the airport in Moscow and is being received by Sahaj Yogis. A car is waiting for her.

Shri Mataji: Again I am back here in Moscow where the people are great seekers of Truth and absolutely ready to achieve their self-realization, which is the goal of our human life. As Christ has said, that you are to be born again, it happens. Yoga is no religion. It is the union with all-pervading divine love. That is the right of every person, every human being. Here, now we have people from Finland, from England, from Germany, from Austria who has come to help my work in Russia. They are all your brothers and sisters. Hope to see you, this evening all of you for the programme. Alright! Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you all of you! (Shri Mataji speaking in the Russian language a word meaning thank you) Shri Mataji folds her hands in namaskar and turns towards the car to get inside it.

Yogi: Thank you, Mother!

(He opens the car door for Shri Mataji. She is seen getting in the car and then the car is leaving)

Scene 2

We see a big stadium where lots of people including Sahaja Yogis are sitting on the grass clapping and singing, waiting for Shri Mataji's arrival. We see the Nirmal Sangeet Sarita music group and other singers, musicians sitting on the stage and one female is singing Hindi bhajan. After the bhajan is over, all the people are seen clapping excitedly in a big stadium.

Shri Mataji is seen arriving followed by Sir C.P. and Yogi Mahajan and others. Few yoginis are standing to greet her. One of them offers flowers to her, Shri Mataji accepts the flowers, thank her and continues walking towards the stage. All of the other yoginis follow her. Few more yogis are seen walking behind her.

Scene 3

Shri Mataji is seen standing on the stage. A little boy goes and gives flowers to her while the crowd continues to clap. Shri Mataji arrives and sits on the seat kept on a slightly higher place. Some children are seen coming on stage with flowers. One by one they go and offer flowers to her. Shri Mataji starts speaking.

Shri Mataji: It is, you can call it a living process of our evolutionary process. So, there is something more that has to happen to us to reach that state. And this is the special time that this is going to happen to all of you. By this happening, you should know that the first thing that happens to you, that you improve in your health and your health problems are solved.

There are many people sitting here who can say that their health problems were solved after coming to Sahaja Yoga. This is the first reason why Sahaja Yoga came to Russia. For this, you don't have to pay. These people do not understand that God does not know anything about money. They also think that you can purchase God, which is absolutely the wrong idea. To be very truthful, I must tell you that God doesn't know what is money is and what is a Bank.

Like these flowers, you see here. They are just miracles from the Mother Earth. How much do we pay to the Mother Earth? This is a living process. And all of you as human beings have a full right to achieve this state. There are also mental cases which have been cured with Sahaja Yoga. This is your own power. It's your own which works it out. This is within you and it is just to be awakened. And once you are awakened, you can awaken other people. All these happenings have been predicted in most of the scriptures.

We human beings have been fighting with each other, not understanding each other, creating problems with each other because we do not know the absolute truth. And we start believing people who are just mad and want you to be mad. Like there is some lady I am told, who says that 24th November everybody is going to be destroyed. This world is going to be destroyed. (Shri Mataji is smiling) One would really laugh at such nonsense. But you do not know there is a big danger because some sort of a possession in the head of a person comes and says that we all will be destroyed.

Yogi: Shri Mataji could you please come again?

Shri Mataji: Some possession in the brain of the person just comes and says that we are all going to be destroyed. We too had one gentleman in India, about forty years back or maybe more who has been saying this. He is dead and still they are saying, but nothing is destroyed. But in America, there was one gentleman, who started this kind of nonsense. And mesmerized many people who joined him especially the young people. And then he told that we are all going to be destroyed on such n such date. But nobody was destroyed so, he put the whole place into fire. Put the fire there and saw to it that children, women, men all of them were killed. Just to prove his own prophecy, so-called.

So, what is the gain of these people? I don't understand. They want to make money or they want to kill people? Is it that Hitler has gone into their head or some sort of a funny idea which is working in their head that they want this world to be destroyed. I assure you, your father God Almighty is an ocean of compassion and love. He has created this world with great care. And he has created you also with very great care and delicate love. How could he allow this world to be destroyed and you people to be destroyed? How can any father do that to his own children?

One has to understand, that there is some sort of a madness about it or some sort of a maniac who is doing all these horrible things. So, please try to protect your children. There have been so many like this. From 1970 I have been telling about these horrible people, how they are trying to use simple faithful people for their own purposes. Now, most of them have been exposed luckily. But still, there are some. like mushrooms come out here and there (Shri Mataji is laughing). Anybody who tells you stories like this, don't believe such a person. Or else who asks money takes money from you for God's work, please know that he is a cheat.

How much money did you give to Christ? On the contrary, he was sold for thirty Roubles. So, all such stupid people, who go on saying things like this should not be followed, use your wisdom. So what is the real Guru should tell you, what is the real Guru should tell you. The real person will say that you have to know the truth. That you have to become one with the all-pervading divine power of love. that real one will put complete confidence in you and Iove so that you can be saved and all your problems could be solved.

The first thing that should happen is that you should get your peace of mind. If your Guru tells that you will be finished on such and such date, how can you have peace of mind? Sometimes they are extremely dangerous. But if you read about any real saints they will tell you, that it is your aim in life to be one with the divine. If they are real saints and truthful, they will always tell you that you have to become the Spirit. They never tell you that you will be destroyed, but they will say you will be resurrected.

So, what we are here for in this world is to be resurrected. The message of Christ-life is that we have to be resurrected. So, these ideas which are being given to you, please be very careful about them. I told you from 1970, I have been telling their names, I have to tell about them, each one of them. I have been telling who they are. Some of them are like Rasputin, some of them are like devils. Some are satanic people, some are a sadist. They have nothing to do with God.

One has to see that, once you understand what is your value, what is your role, what is your identity, then only such a person should be accepted as a Master. Not a guru who goes on taking out somebody's posters and like a mad violently runs make everybody run all over the places. Or on the road you see some people taking mantras or singing some mad like songs or wearing funny dresses or wearing some saffron clothes. How much does it take to make any cloth saffron? By changing your dress you are not changing inside. You have to change within.

The transformation has to come inside not outside. Unless and until that transformation comes in you cannot get over your weaknesses. Your problems cannot be solved. And you can never understand why you are on this Earth. What is the purpose of your life? Why have you come here? Because you are seekers, because you are seeking something higher, you may jump into nonsense. And I am quite worried because it's a threat to you people, especially in Moscow where people are very simple.

They are very wise but still, they might be lured by people who are just trying to mesmerize them. For example, in India, there was one gentleman who used to mesmerize people and give them gold, diamond this that. Some important people went to see that fellow and there were four cameras you see (Shri Mataji pointing towards cameras and smiling) just like these. And it's very surprising, that he mesmerized these important people, but he could not mesmerize the cameras. And in the camera, they found out how he was playing these tricks. And, of course, everybody knows about it now. So, all these kind of nonsense you have to be careful.

Because you have all the qualities, all the properties and all the powers within yourself. (Shri Mataji addressing Yogi Mahajan in Hindi- Yogi! Yogi! Wahan ek ladka abhi bhi betha hua hai us Kursi par kuch Kar Raha hai, usko bhagaiye baahar) Now, the main understanding is that we are not created to be wasted. you are human beings epitome of evolution. Sometimes people think animals are better than human beings, but I can't give self-realization to animals. I can only give it to human beings, that means human beings are much more evolved, much much more evolved than any animal whatsoever.

This power that is within you, when it germinates or when it is awakened then you are amazed how it transforms your whole lifestyle. Apart from your health, apart from your mental conditions, it is a blissful state where you are completely aware. You are not mesmerized by any chance. Not only aware, but you know how powerful you are within. You have to only know how to grow in your spirituality and how to use this power.

This power which is within you was known to many people before, but there was no such mass resurrection. But this is a special time. I call it a Blossom Time when you get your self-realization. There is no religion in it. We don't say, don't do this don't do that. Nothing of the kind. There is no ritual. It's absolutely a scientific thing that is within you. This power you can see sometimes also with your naked eyes (unclear) and you can verify it because it comes out of your fontanelle bone area. You can feel it, the cool breeze coming out of your head.

You can feel it on your fingertips. And once you start using it you are amazed. You can feel another person's centres because you develop a new dimension in your awareness. You can feel it. Another person because you have a dimension called collective consciousness. Moreover then you start feeling as if we are all part and parcel of one. It is not just a mental or emotional idea but it's actually is that Microcosm becomes a Macrocosm.

In the whole world now there are fifty-five Nations who are doing Sahaja Yoga. In Russia in one place (unclear) only, we have twenty-two thousand Sahaj yogis. They are not only realized souls but they know what it is. They know the power. It's all tangible can be explained medically scientifically. It is a Meta Science but it is so simple so easy because it deals with fundamental within us.

I have to just tell you that this happening is absolutely without any problem. For Russians especially, I think it's very creditable because they are very evolved people. Western people that way are not so wise. I went to America, especially to Boston and the people, television people asked me, how many Rolls Royces I have! Such stupid things they ask me that I gave up. I just thought what are they seeking? Rolls Royce or they are seeking their Spirit? (Shri Mataji laughs) It is very difficult to deal with stupid people that's why my heart is in Russia (the audience is clapping) and Ukraine (Shri Mataji bows to them with folded hands).

So, now we will have a little session of self-realization, which will take hardly about ten to fifteen minutes. But you cannot force it. I respect your freedom and I would not like to force it on you. It just works automatically if you have a pure desire to have it. If there are people who don't want to have self-realization should leave the hall. I'll be thankful for that.

Yogi: (inaudible)

Shri Mataji: I'll be thankful for that. Now, those who want to have self-realization should have full confidence, that they will get their self-realization tonight. Of course, I can not tell you in this short time everything about it.

Yogi: (inaudible)

Shri Mataji: In this short time I cannot tell you everything about it. But we have got tapes, we have got our centres where you can know everything about it. The only thing today, you should get your awakening of Kundalini. If that works out, everything will be alright. Let us try a short method (Shri Mataji laughs then she puts her hands forward towards the audience as if to feel the vibrations and gives a beautiful smile) Now please put your right hand towards me like this and with the left hand you, bend your head and see for yourself if there is any cool breeze coming out of the fontanelle bone area (Shri Mataji bends her head and shows how to check the vibrations on top of the head) Now, don't doubt yourself. Have full faith in yourself and don't feel guilty. Tell yourself I am not guilty at all. Now please put your left hand towards me.

Now, please put down your head and see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area or maybe hot because you have not forgiven. Please forgive everyone. By forgiving or not forgiving you are not doing anything, but if you don't forgive then you play in wrong hands. So, forgive everyone, forgive yourself also. See, hot air is coming. Now, plz put your right hand again once more. Now, see with your left hand if there is a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming from your fontanelle bone area. Please don't put your hand on top of your head but away from it, you can feel it. This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. (Voice of a lady can be heard in the background as if she is in pain)

Now, please put both the hands towards the sky like this and ask a question- Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Ask three times. Or ask Mother is this the cool breeze of the all-pervading power of divine love? Either this question you ask three times.

Now take down your hands, please. Please put your hands like this and watch me and see if there is no thought in your mind.

Shri Mataji: (Shri Mataji noticing for the first time the voice of the lady in pain) Who's that? What is it?

Sahaja Yogi: The woman is sick.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Sahaja Yogi: The woman is sick.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Sahaja Yogi: Is sick. The woman is sick.

Shri Mataji: No! No! Please take the sick lady out just now. I'll see her later on in the room. I will see all of them.

Sahaja Yoga: She cannot stand up (few voices can be heard among the audience)

Shri Mataji: What's happened?

Sahaja Yogi: She lost her conscious Shri Mataji. She can't stand up. She can't stand up.

Shri Mataji: She is quite conscious. No! No! She is quite conscious. She is just making a fuss (a vague figure of a man is seen ) Doctor is there. Let him see. Alright! Doesn't matter! Don't worry about her. She will be alright. Doctors will look after. You see sick people should meet me otherwise. I'll meet them afterwards.

Sahaja Yogi: She is going to be alright.

Shri Mataji: She is alright! (Shri Mataji asking the doctor attending the sick lady, in the Hindi language) Kya baat hai? Doctor Saheb Kya baat hai? Ban rahi hai.

Doctor: (unclear)

Shri Mataji: Eh!

Doctor: (unclear)

Shri Mataji: Sunaai nahin dey raha?

Doctor: Is waqt to theek hai.

Shri Mataji: Theek hai? She is Alright. Haan ley key jaiyega. She is alright, alright! Now, again put your hands. Now, don't worry about her. This is what is the negative force. They come here to disturb, just to disturb everybody's ascent. It's better. Now, all those who have felt a cool or hot breeze on their hands or out of their fontanelle bone area, please raise both your hands.

See now, despite the problem you all have felt it. (Everybody clapping and Shri Mataji smiling both her hands up in the air in namaskar) This proves that you all deserve your self-realization. I didn't do anything. (everybody clapping again and Shri Mataji smiling looking happy) (Shri Mataji speaking in the Hindi language to someone in the audience and enquiring about the sick lady -Jara dekh lijiye usey utha key ley Gaye Hain. Kya kah rahi hai woh. Aisey tamashey karte Hain aur Kya). She is just fussing for nothing. She'll go. Alright! Thank you very much! (Shri Mataji does namaskar to all and smile, the audience applause)

Shri Mataji: They always make these people sit in front. See, you have to become doctors. Thousands have been cured with Sahaja Yoga. You can also. But I must tell you that people who get cured don't have that much strength of spirituality.

(Shri Mataji looks in right side and asks in Hindi language meaning who all have come? ) kaun kaun aaya hai? (A little girl comes to offer flowers to Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji accepts the flowers with a smile on her face, Audiences clap) Shri Mataji: Thank you! (Shri Mataji in Hindi language- uppar Jara Pani (unclear) ho jayegi)

(Two children come to offers flowers to Shri Mataji) Shri Mataji: how are you?

(Sahaj yogis in the stadium start singing Bhajan 'Anandi nirguni ') Shri Mataji is seen holding an infant in her arms.

Shri Mataji is seen leaving with Sir C.P., Yogi Mahajan and others. she is meeting yogis standing on the way and talking to them. She moves and arrives near her car. Some yogis are standing, she is seen talking to them. Shri Mataji gets inside her car. One Yogi is seen talking to her from the car window while other Sahaja yogis are standing outside. Her car is seen leaving.

Sahaj Yogis: (all together) Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmal Devi ki Jai, ki Jai, ki Jai!

Scene 4

Shri Mataji is seen arriving at the departure point at the airport. She is receiving flowers from Sahaja Yogis. One Yogi collects all the flowers in her hands and takes them away. Shri Mataji is smiling and arriving. More Sahaja Yogis offering flowers. Shri Mataji is seen accepting flowers from them. Voices of Sahaja Yogi's singing praise of Shri Mataji can be heard in the background. Yogi Mahajan and Sir C.P. can be seen following her. She turns to handover flowers to yogis and again starts accepting flowers from Sahaja yogis. Finally, she arrives where yoginis standing all around her are clapping & singing. She is seen speaking to Sir C.P. Shri Mataji sits down on the sofa and everybody sits around her. She is offered a glass of water. A Sahaja yogi comes and sits next to her on her left-hand side.

Shri Mataji is seen talking (inaudible) and laughing. She is interacting with Sahaja Yogis and there is applause from them. The Sahaja Yogi sitting on the ground next to Shri Mataji says something in Russian language and one by one yogi start offering flowers to Shri Mataji. She is smiling and accepting flowers. laughing sometimes talking with Sahaja Yogis sitting next to her. Shri Mataji's name is being announced and there is some message for her in the Russian language. Everybody is laughing and Shri Mataji is smiling.

A very pretty little girl comes towards Shri Mataji with a white stuffed toy in a plastic cover, someone takes out the toy from the plastic cover and gives it to Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji accepts the gift (which is an animal in white with a tail in perhaps a cat or a dog not clear) and is seen talking to the girl while she just stands and looks at Shri Mataji in all innocence.

Shri Mataji is seen talking to a Yogi and she says: Oh!

Yogi: Shri Mataji (unclear) you are always in our heart. You will always remain in her heart.

Shri Mataji: Thank you!

Yogi: (unclear) What is your goal?

Shri Mataji: What is my goal? Now the time has come for people to achieve their self-realization and to get complete transformation for the betterment of people ( inaudible n unclear) These are special times and Russians are the special people having great wisdom. They know what is reality and what is falsehood. They are spiritually (unclear) people also people of Ukraine. They deserve this resurrection very much. (Inaudible unclear because of announcements for flights being made at the airport)

This is what we have been waiting for. For this, you don't have to pay for anything. It's your own power (unclear) everything because of this special time and special people. That's is why I am going to Moscow, Leningrad, Tagliyati and Ukraine. They are all realized souls. As Sahaja Yogis, they know how to achieve the resurrection of others. They know everything about the subtle system within. It's working out in fifty-five nations and all their problems are practically solved. They are enjoying themselves with the collectivity. (Unclear because of announcements being made at the airport) and it's working out in fifty-five Nations. Apart from India, Russia and Ukraine are the highest numbers. Yogi: (speaking in Russian language translation of Shri Mataji's words )

Shri Mataji: Yes (she smiles and everyone claps)

Yogi: (question unclear)

Shri Mataji: As I told you there is a power within us in the triangular bone sacrum. And this Sacrum Bone is called Sacrum means sacred that means the Greeks knew it is sacred. This power when awakened connects you with the all-pervading power. See, these flowers (unclear) who does this work? Divine power. But once you are connected with this power then you have a meaningful life and (unclear).

Yogi: (unclear)

Shri Mataji: Everybody says the same thing. There is no argument, no quarrelling, no war because you also achieve peace of mind. (unclear) it's the right of every human being get that state. Thank you!

(Everyone clapping and Shri Mataji smiling and doing Namaskar)

Yogi : (inaudible) very important question. Shri Mataji what do you want to say to all Russian Sahaja Yogis? What do they need to do now?

Shri Mataji: They should spread Sahaja Yoga, give realization. Sahaja Yoga can prove that Christ is the son of God. It can prove, It's not just a blind Faith. It's not mental. Actualization happens. You can feel the cool breeze. (Shri Mataji place her hand above Sahasrar to show how cool breeze can be felt) Shri Mataji folds her hands near her heart to say thank you and smile)

Shri Mataji gets up to leave. All Sahaja Yogis are clapping and singing. Shri Mataji is moving forward amidst the cheering of the Sahaja Yogis followed by Sir C.P. and others. She is not visible for sometimes in the crowd of people and then she is seen waving at Sahaja Yogis before entering the main airport area. Sir C.P. is also seen waving Yogis are singing Mahamaya Mahakaali Bhavani Nirmal Maa while Shri Mataji is looking extremely happy waving at all of them. The bhajan continued till last and Shri Mataji is turning back again n again to wave at them.
