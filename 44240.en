Birthday Puja Mumbai (Date unknown)

I bow to all the seekers of truth. It is very kind of you all to have come to celebrate my birthday.

It’s all your goodness. In modern times; who looks after the mother? One of the signs of modern times is that the parents will be neglected by the children. They may have to stay in an orphanage. BUT I find all of you here with such love, with such affection, all the way from all distances you have come to greet your Mother. Words stop at this point. I cannot understand the love that is pouring so much like an ocean over Me. I just get lost into the beautiful feeling of a Mother who has thousands of children, who are so kind and also after Her image of a good son or a good daughter. We had another great mother here GIVEN BY this Maharashtra ... 2:18 and she is the one SHE HAS MADE UP HER SON ... that one day her son will be able to establish the kingdom of God, of honesty, of freedom, of character. Such 2:40 ... are born in many years. Even his (OR HER) son could not come up to this character. The way he respected the daughter in law of ... 3:01, the way he came towards people, the way he led a life of dynamic BHAKTI 3:13 Such people are rarely born and he could not even CREATE 3:23 someone like him.

But today I am so very fortunate to have children of your great character, understanding and such spiritual VALUES 3:46 Sahaja Yoga has created a new culture of spiritual value. The value system has taken a funny shape in the modern times, but it is modern times only when the shuttles of this horrible culture – whether you call it eastern, western, modern, ancient, anythink, because all of them have gone to the COLLAPSABLE stages 4:25. One finds a new culture, a new ... REALM OR LAND 4 :35, a new age of a new race coming up.

I am so gratified that you are all here to represent that culture of spiritual values, where we do not believe in any separatist ideals. We are not REACTIONS 5:08, we do not react to any concept. We are SELFMADE? 5:15 standing on our self experiences and the truth, that is so evident. We are not the people who have taken to a kind of a violent or a peaceful - if you call it - reaction to the society. Like we have many organisations who HAD FIND 5:45 this is the reaction to this country, this is the reaction to that. This is not a society that is demanding anything like money, power – nor is a society that calls itself a ... MODERN 6:00 or the ... under privileged pople. It is the most privileged society you have to make. The essence of this privilege is that you are all Yogis, you are all saints, you are all ... 6:16. That there ist the satisfaction in your heart, that now the time has come to give, no more asking for oil or for LIGHT 6:31. What you have got is the light and the oil, all you have to just spread this love into the whole world. Such confidence of love, such modesty of ... GRAVITY?, such sharpness of compassion, such deep peace. It‘s PREVALENT 7:03 in the society of Sahaja Yogis the friendship, the love. Like many waves of beautiful thoughts and feelings. This ocean of a new understanding of a higher life, of a sober life, of a sublime life has to break all the barriers, all the  nonsensical WORK 7:36 Today we are FACING 7:40, face to face thank God, due to fundamentalist, due to fanatics, due to not-believers, due to politicians, economics, scientists, all of them, who are conditioned by whatever ... past WAS CREATED 8:00 Scientists are very much more conditioned than everybody else. They just refuse to accept that there is God Almighty... They are not scientists, because they have no open-mindedness. If you don’t have an open-mindedness, you are not a scientist.

Now the time has come for you to prove the existence of God and His Realm, which gives us security, peace and joy. Our Kundalini – I don’t know how MANY INDIANS HAVE GIVEN ... in so many ways that it should be appreciated, understood, knowledgeable to all of you. Only the knowledge of Kundalini is not going to help us at all. You might fight some people who have much more knowledge of Kundalini than some of you have. They might have read at least hundreds books on Kundalini, but it is not the same. KNOW 9:05 it is not the knowledge. It has to be BUILT UP 9:07, it has to be known on your central nervous system. It has to be in your beeing, that you should be able to know what is Kundalini. As soon as you see somebody you should know where he stands - as far as spirituality is concearned.

As soon as you feel the atmosphere you should know where you are - as far as God’s ... 9 :32 is concearnd. I must tell you a story. Once I was traveling with my husband in Kashmir. And just in a very wild place I felt tremendous vibrations. And I felt, from where these vibrations are coming? So my husband said, how can you have vibrations in this far old place? He asked the driver. He said no, there is no temple, nothing, it’s a very wild place. I said ALL RIGHT let’s go that way. And we went one way ahead about five miles and there some muslims, more muslims were living there. So the driver asked them..., is there a temple? No, there is no temple. But about A MILE ... there is ... Hazrat Mugpal OR DIGPAL 10:32. Hazrat Mugpal (OR DIGPAL) was the one heir of Mohammad Sahab. Can you imagine the vibrations? I caught them of about 5-6 miles away, from one heir of Mohammad Sahab. When we deny Mohammad, when we deny Christ, when we deny Krishna or we deny Dattatreya, we are denying the truth, because they are all one. There is no difference. They are like CROWNS 11:04 on one tree of life. We are not TO JUDGE 11:11 they are OUR JUDGE. We are not to judge them, we haven‘t got that capacity to judge the people. What capacity we have, that we have ... 11:20, to reach, that has to mature. The spiritualy has to mature to that extent where wherever is Nizamudin 11 :33 or it is ... or it is Sainath, to see nothing but Dattatreya THROUGH THEM 11:37. For that you have to have that SIGHT 11:40 of Kabira. You have to have that growth of Nanaka. Otherwise we just talk. Those who have understood Sahaja Yoga have understood that all these barriers of religion has no meaning. It‘s all integrated, well-woven and worked out beautifully by sending all these Incarnations, all these Great Prophets on this Earth. To create the humanity which is described by Confucius. To create valencies after valencies, which are 10 valencies that we call as Dharma, of a human Dharma, which is described by Confucius. ... 12:20 no doubt, but still he says the same thing, same THEME.  As I said this morning Sahaja Yoga has only one THEME 12:32 and that is pure love. It has no gread, it has no lust, it has no ambitions, nothing! It has nothing but pure love flowing through your channels ... 12:49.

I know we have achieved a very great hight. Think that we have people from all over the world to follow this path ... 12:53 Now it is for others to see whether they can come up with ALL THIS TURMOIL 13:06 because Sahaja Yoga is not a thing where you BE ON A ... 13:11 you can pay some money or you ... CERTIFY 13:16 that I am a Sahaja Yogi. Is the bigger way of Sahaja Yoga, if you want. Those who have that capacity will come to us. Don’t you worry ... NOT THE WHOLE world has to come ... Those who have to come, can join us and can enjoy themselves can have ... that enjoyment... We cannot run after them, we cannot fall at their feet, come along « take to God ». Let them themselves come on their own and enjoy the beauty of their own being 13:50, which is created by God specially for them.

Today, I must say that every year, the age AS YOU SAID... in a way - because you are going towards your goal. But one has to remeber that every year you mature. You mature like a seed comes up to a tree, becomes a flower and ultimately a fruit. And the fruit has to fall again to the ground, to give the SUBSTANCE 14:30 of the same ... In the same way whatever he thinks 14:33 whether the time is passing, one has to just judge how far are my children in compassion, in love, in understanding OF TRUTH 14:46. How far I can stand against all the 14:52 ATTROCITIES DONE to others who are suffering. We have to open our eyes to the society. To our surrowndings, to our country, to other countries, to everyone. We have to ... together. It’s not to be enjoyed only by YOU people. It is to be given to others and for that those who come to us,  we have to tell them. I am sure one day will come when many will open their eyes and see for themselves that the only solution from this world’s turmoil is Self Realisation, to know themselves, that people still ... Once it happens I am sure, I am verily sure that this world will become a beautiful garden of ONENESS.

May God bless you all!
