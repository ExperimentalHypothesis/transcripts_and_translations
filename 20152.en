[During the evening music programme]

Shri Mataji: Hallo. [Checking the microphone]

Me and My family all visited Rome and saw the school and the children.

It was really very sweet and very loving expression of their joy that we saw there.

And Mr. Shrivastava was very much impressed by that, and he has given 11 million Italian Liras for the “Association of Culturale Sahaja Yoga”.

[Applause]

Guido: I mean, one feels really speechless in an occasion like this. And I must say already Shri Mataji has been so generous. And just imagine, last month She has donated a brand new car, a Fiat called Brava, is a new model, fully equipped with air conditioning and all the gadgets. And already we didn’t know what to say, I mean, such a generosity is, of course, always an example for all of us, and there is nothing we can do to compare it. And...

So, just from the bottom of our hearts, we can only say: Thank You, Shri Mataji. Thank you, Sir C.P. And what else? I’m running out of words!

[Applause]

[during part 1 of the program, after the children have performed]

Guido: As you may know, last night, down in the village, we had a play – a play in Italian, in Italian language – performed by Sahaja Yogis from Rome, which are not professional actors, but it seems they did quite well and the play had a big success and they have already been invited in different towns. So with the permission of Shri Mataji, we would like just to invite them on the stage to take Her blessings. The play was taken from a script of Kahlil Gibran, and it was Jesus, the Son of Man.

Shri Mataji: Hello. [checking microphone] Me and My family all visited Rome and saw the school and the children. It was really very sweet and very loving expression of their joy that we saw there. And Mr. Shrivastava was very much impressed by that, and he has given eleven million Italian Liras for the ‘Association of Culturale Sahaja Yoga’.

[Applause]

Guido: I mean, one feels really speechless in an occasion like this. And I must say, already Shri Mataji has been so generous.

[later during the music program]

Babamama: One Qawali, last, by the Nirmal Sangeet Sarita, but on one condition... All right, he’ll give you a fast Qawali, but he’ll begin with a slow tempo. It will pick up, but one condition. I wouldn’t want to see anybody sitting, everybody must stand. If the booklet is here, this Qawali is in the booklet. It is speaking about the love of Shri Mataji – one minute, you must hear this, it is very important. I have said that, because of Her incapacity, or obstinacy, we are not able to receive the incessant love of Shri Mataji, which is ever-flowing. Even if She wants to stop, She cannot stop, because that is a force, or an energy, which She passes on to you. It is not... that love is not like the sun that gets hid in the clouds. That love is not like a river which can get bound by a [unclear] or a jam. That love is not like the shadow which leaves you in the dark. That love is not like the moon, which reduces or increases. It is incessant, permanent and ever-flowing. That is the love.
