Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Wimbledon (UK), 5 March 1986.

It's such a great thing to meet your children after such a long time, and that this country was really pestered with cold so I had to come here, I think just to keep me warmer with love. It's a very heartening thing to see so many people who are in England, who are Sahajyogis. As you know England has to do tremendous effort to keep Sahaja Yoga afloat; not only that, but you have to set in examples for others.

As England is the heart of the universe, it circulates. Whatever example you set in, circulates. People try to follow you. As I've told you before also that English people should not try to follow other people, but establish their own proper character, but not to be insular by which you don't appreciate anybody else or you cannot understand international relationships; that we are one world and it's only one great Virat in whose being we circulate. Moreover for the from the heart have to be much more open and moving and giving because that's the job of the cell of a blood that passes through heart and that's how you are made specially for this.

I've been speaking after you finished your tour on a subject in India but I think it is more related to us here in the West than to Indians. And that is something we have to understand that we are in the midst of terrible conditions, horrible conditions which are taking us to hell and if you realize how important it is, come and sit down, how important it is for us to get together and save this area which we called as the Western world. So I've already given a little talk which you may hear when you have this seminar or this Shiv Puja.

But I would like to tell you about it, that Shri Krishna long time back told that the roots of the awareness are in the brain. But the human awareness grows downward. That's how we have grown downward. We have grown towards things which if allowed to grow that way may take us away completely from the roots.

Now if you start, say, the movement, as I said from Bhava Sagara, from the evolutionary process of going downward. Now in the Bhava Sagara that is in the viscera, the stomach and all these places, we have a capacity, what we call as of consumption. We can even consume the poison. The liver can consume the poison; it has the capacity to consume the poison as heat and then it delivers the heat to the bloodstream, I mean the water of the bloodstream. So the capacity we have to consume all those things makes us, what we call Svaha. Svaha means consumption and from this consumption, when we consume all these things; we consume our ego, we consume our conditioning, we consume our all those things which are detrimental to our growth, we become Svadha. Sva is the spirit and Dha is the dharma. We get the dharma of the spirit and you know what is the dharma of the spirit is, is Sahaj, Sahaja.

But when we start going downward only with our awareness, from the Nabhi Chakra we start moving downward. What happens to us that we move to the second position of Swadhisthana and the Swadhisthana has got the essence, I mean, has got the capacity to be Bhuvah. Bhuvah means the whole creation, the universe that is created, that's how we get creativity through Swadhisthana. So when we start moving downward, what happens to us, we go to all the stars and the planets and all that are created, that's what we are doing, wasting our energy for nothing at all. But apart from that in the wrong way when we move, our attention goes to creativity which is destructive, which is negative, which brings death, which suggests insipidness. Like the art today is, when you see the art you don't know whether to vomit, to run away or to cry. So that explains why people are producing such horrid things and when you look at them you don't understand what is this going on. So the art, the creativity in every way, the creativity of every kind becomes so horrid.

So the third stage is that we go to Bhooh. Bhooh is Mother Earth. Mother Earth is the one which also creates Shri Ganesh. Now when we go towards Mother Earth we start extracting Mother Earth, taking out all that is precious, that is needed out of proportion because we have got machines. Now we have got machines, so we must produce. The machine must produce more and more and more, out of proportion. It should go on, and when it wants to continue, it has to go on that way so that you feed the machine to produce more. Now this production is useless. There is no need to have so much production for us. You see plastics after plastics, then there's nylons after nylons, then there's all kinds of polyester and I don't know all kinds of things that they have started producing. All man-made nonsense that they have. There's no need to have so much. But then we go on accumulating things and that's how we become extremely materialistic people. Actually to be materialistic in the real sense is that we understand the value of matter. And the value of the matter is aesthetics. Artistic things, real artistic things and beyond that is the value of matter is that you can give love to others. Through that matter, by giving as presents, by your generosity. So you lose that also, that power also you lose. That is, you start extracting your Mother Earth in such a way that you don't know what to do with the acid gas that is coming out of this productions and then all your trees are getting destroyed. It's so destructive, the whole thing is so destructive.

So then you move to the essence of Mooladhara which is innocence. And when it is innocence, you start attacking innocence. Now you read horrible things, when you come here, I got the jitters when I heard about the six year old girl and a three year old girl, I just can't bear it. Supposing that was my child what would have happened to me, and it's my child, that's how I feel. Then we are attacking the innocence everywhere in every place and we have no sense of Mooladhara.

That's how we go down and one step forward where do we go, into hell. That is our movement. We're going towards hell, straight forward, our movement is towards hell, because I've explained in that little talk, you can hear it again. That when you see the steps, you see the downward steps, then you'll just see the platforms which are very good, maybe of marble, very attractive, very sensational, whatever you may call it. And you feel like going down, it's easy to go down with the gravity because you have come out from amoeba state, or even earlier from carbon stage, so you feel it's easy to go down. It's much easier to go down, so you go on stepping on these steps and go down. You don't see the heights.

But when you're going higher, rising higher then you start seeing the heights. And when you see the heights what do you see from down below. Absolutely this is our task. From the hell we have to pull out people up. It's hell, and this is what we call as the Adhogati, going downward. Adhogati, going downward. We have to take to Udhovagati, going higher. How do we go higher. Only Kundalini is the way. That you can see clearly. Even people who try to go higher without the Kundalini, say from Nabhi upwards, how do they do it. They go up to Mana, this is the emotional side. That's the motherhood and you go against the mother. When you go there what you find that you get attached to this woman, that woman, then that thing, it goes on to this family, to other things and again you come down.

Then you go ahead, you go into Janah, it's the one which is what we call the public, the others. Janah is the public, is the Virata's place as you know this is the Virata's place. And when you go to that place, to Virata's place, what happens to you. That you start becoming very conscious of yourself, "Oh, I'm a public man, I'm a public person, this is my reputation, I'm this and I'm that." And then you start exploiting people with your politics and all other things like that. And you develop your egos, all kinds of nonsensical things.

With your Mana, from your centre heart you develop also your conditionings. And that's how you develop a funny personality which is not Udhovagati, which is not going higher, but is actually giving you additional problems on your back. Then the third thing is here at the Agnya, as I told you, you develop your ego.

The other day, Patrick rang me up to say, "Mother, why are we developing our Agnyas so much nowadays." I said, "Stop reading newspapers." The prime ministers are fighting for their seats and this and that and if you read newspapers you'll also feel that you are a prime minister, you'll better fight it. And when you see a picture or any drama sometimes you get identified and you think, "I'm Napoleon myself." So don't read newspapers, don't read these mad, about these mad people who are just trying to overpower each other.

Like this Marcos fellow. The other day somebody said that, "Mother, you get rid of this Marcos." Now he's out. So many will be out but what about us. Do we have some of them within our heads. Do we also have the same ideas of materialism or ego or all these trips that these people have had. So as a result, when you see these things, on the contrary, you should try to avoid it and jump on to Udhovagati.

Then you go higher. From there in the head is the Sat, is the truth. That's what you discover, truth, should discover in the normal way. But in the abnormal conditions when you try just to climb up to the brain, what happens is that whatever you know through your mental conception becomes the truth. Everyone is like that.

See about religion you'll find a person believes that this is the truth. "Now this is the truth, I am the one who represents, say, Christianity. I'm the one who represents Mohamad Sahib. I'm the one who represents Nanak Sahib, I'm the one who represents Shri Rama, Shri Krishna." None of them represent. It's just a concept and with that concept if you move about like that then what happens, you just get stuck on to that idea. That is how fanaticism comes in as far as religion is concerned. There are many, many things like that, "This is a concept and that's the tract, and that's the truth and that's what I believe in this." Why do you believe in that? Who are you? When they say, "I believe," just go and ask them, "Who are you after all to believe in that." That's Mr. Ego, that's also. Then there are people who are conditioned. And that's whatever is their conditioning they think, "This is the conditioning, this is the thing I am brought up, this is how I have lived and this is how I am, and this is what is the truth." Both things are absurd, mythical. That's not the truth.

So when you start through your Udhovagati, through your Kundalini you see the height. You see that. Now we have to rise, we have to rise. Rise with our innocence. We have to get to our innocence. We have to be innocent people. But even in Sahaja Yoga you'll find some people, I'll call them sometimes like monkeys, jump from Udhovagati to Adhogati. Adhogati to Udhovagati. You don't know which side they are going. You have to hold on to these steps which you have got.

First is the innocence. Your morality, as you call that, or the chastity. That's the first step you have to achieve. Unless and until you achieve that step how are you going to go further. But it's the other way round. They think if you tell something very truthfully to Mother, "I've had five love affairs, I have had six abortions, ten this thing, then Mother is going to be very happy with me," because they've told the truth. That's not the truth, that's not what is wanted. Are you now a chaste person? Have you got the ideas of chastity and dharma. That is the second step you can move into. Aesthetically, are you rich aesthetically, are you generous? Can you appreciate the art of every country? Or you just say, "Oh it's not good because it's not English," or "It's not good because it's not French," or maybe it's not from Wimbledon, come to that point. I mean, what is happening to us, we're becoming so insular, so small, so narrow in our outlook, that's impossible. We cannot appreciate another person at all. You ask anyone, everybody has an opinion about others, what about yourself? What is your opinion about yourself, can you laugh at yourself? And when I'm giving lecture we also sometimes think that Mother is talking about somebody XYZ, not about me. That's not so. We have to project to ourselves and find out, "Are we in chastity? Are we in dharma?" Have we achieved that, have we achieved our innocence? Have our eyes achieved that innocence, that simplicity, that power?

So then we move upward higher on the Bhuvah state where we have to know, are we aesthetically equipped? Do we have proper aesthetics? In our behavior, in our dress, in our lifestyle, everything or are we still going on with the same things. Like some hippies when they come to Sahaja Yoga, it's impossible to make them understand that, "No more hippies now." Then some come from another group, another funny style, then they have the same style of behavior. No, Sahaja, we have to be in the Sahaja style which is a common style for all the Sahaja Yogis all over the world to dress up decently, to talk decently, to have sweet words; no harsh words, no anger, no temper. Nothing of the kind, but very, very gentle and a dignified personality. Now here some of the so-called dignified also can be very bhootish, I have seen that, they can be very dignified and they can be very inauspicious.

So the, another quality of innocence, which is auspiciousness or we can say the combination of innocence and Bhuvah state is auspiciousness. Does your house is auspicious, gives auspiciousness? Does your countenance give auspiciousness? Does your talk is auspicious? Is it a mantra when you talk? Have you purified yourself so much that everything that you do, every movement that you have, is auspicious? Is it blissful to be in your house? To be in your company? To be with you? Is it blissful? Let us direct ourselves to ourselves and see that are we blissful? Are we emitting vibrations that are good? It's a very tremendous task because you have to do it. You have to do it, nobody else is going to do it. If you want to save this world, you must know it's a tremendous task and one has to go into a Tapah for that, to know that you have to be pure people. Otherwise there could be hypocrites.

There are many who are Sahaja Yogis and not at all Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yoga is not for hypocrites at all. You cannot be hypocrite. You have to be what you preach, what you say, what you understand and what we stand for. It's not like this, "Oh I'm a Christian, all right, I'm a Christian, but it's all right, I can have adulterous eyes, all right, it's after all, you see it's all allowed." Then what else? "Oh, I can drink, smoke." What else? "Oh, I can also kill some people, doesn't matter, you see it's all allowed, Christian after all." How are you a Christian? "Then I'm a Hindu, you see I'm a perfect Hindu, but doesn't matter, you see if I try to discriminate between Sikhs and Hindus, doesn't matter." How, why? There's no discrimination allowed in Hinduism, no discrimination of any kind. Everybody has the same Atma. How can you discriminate, how can you have dowry system in a Hindu society? How can you have any system of, caste system in a Hindu society? You cannot have, just cannot have. It's not the religion. So they speak one thing, do another thing, all hypocrites and all fanatics. And that's how they become fanatics.

Like you ask Bishop of Canterbury, he says that, "Holy Ghost, I don't know, I'm agnostic about it, I'm doing my job, that's all." This kind of frivolous attitude or we can say a very hypocritical attitude is not for the Sahaja Yogis. They have to be what they're preaching, what they're standing for. They cannot have that kind of a personality that one can say, "Oh, I've seen this hypocritical fellow, calls himself Sahaja Yogi." We can't. There has to be somebody who is genuine, who is real, who is truthful. We cannot live with that kind of a compromise, we have to be what we are, because we have got the light of the spirit.

So then you go ahead and you have to become the higher personality of a Guru through consumption. Consume, how much I consume. Go on consuming all the time. This time I came, I'm consuming your left Vishuddhis, I'm consuming your viruses, I don't know. In two days I must have consumed oceans and oceans of troubles. No, we don't consume at all because if somebody says something to us we must come back with a harsh word, somehow or other to kill that person that is finished forever, that's smartness. We can consume all that. That consumption is taught by Christ very well. Can we consume? No, we come out with big, big talks and big, big things, you see, "We must do this, we must do that." We're not here union leaders, are we? We don't want to appear in the newspapers or anything. What we want to consume, we are here to consume things. Newspapers are to, say, advertize, expand it. We're here to consume all that is bad, you follow your responsibility please. Consume that is wrong. How do we consume? Through meditation, through prayers. Now this is happening in this country. What are we doing about it? So we have to consume it, not to get into explosions, not to get into expressions, but to consume it.

Then you become Svadha. Svadha is that you become the dharma of the spirit. Sva, Dha, you sustain that dharma within yourself. Then you become that. It's not any kind of hypocrisy about it. You just, I mean, if I say, "Don't drink." You shouldn't drink wine. I don't drink at all, no question, I mean, you cannot make me drink, even if you want to. If I say, "Don't tell lies," then you don't tell lies, you don't just do it because you have to just say that way, or you say that, "Don't kill." I cannot kill anyone. I cannot be tempted. In the same way you all have to be, "I cannot do it, I cannot be tempted. How can I be tempted?" Say, I shouldn't get into tempers. I shouldn't be angry for nothing at all. For the slightest thing, people just jump into a temper. That means, I should not be tempted to do it. That wisdom, that dignity, that balance, that poise must come into a Sahaja Yogi. Unless and until that comes into you who's going to believe you that you have achieved the transformation. You're still on Adhogati, sometimes into Udhovagati, then going into Adhogati, again to Udhovagati, you're jumping from one to another.

So now you move on to another higher level, is from there to what you call the Maha Lakshmi Tattwa starts where you start jumping on to a much higher position where it is Mana. Mana is, I said, is emotions. Your emotions become compassion. Now see the difference between emotions and compassion, is very different. You see, when the tree hasn't got flowers, it takes, when it gets the flower, it gives. It gives the fragrance. In the same way, when you become the compassion, you give. You don't expect how others treat you, how others behave towards you. But you think, by giving, you'll be no other person, you give. And that is what you have got to give compassion through your vibrations. But to have that you have to be Svadha. Unless and until you have that you cannot give vibrations either.

So then all these smaller ideas, "It's my wife, my husband, my child, my house, my this, my brother, my sister." In the beginning everybody comes up with the whole family list. They may not have seen their father for ten years but they'll come, "My father is sick, Mother cure him first. I've not seen him for ten years, doesn't matter." So every person becomes a liability on Mother that you must, all the relations, all the great grand parents and all the great grand children must be cured by Sahaja Yoga. But there is no compassion. And in compassion you do not see these relations like...

So when you become the compassion, before this you are to be enlightened. You're to be enlightened, you have no light, you don't know how to go up the path. You don't know how to go round, you don't know how to know others, you don't know where you're sitting. If in a group, you put off the lights everybody starts sort of hitting each other or trampling over each other because they don't know. But now the lights are on. So you know how you are related to each other. You're under the light. You can see each other. You can feel each other. You can understand each other. That's how the compassion works. Compassion works automatically. You don't have to do much about it. But know that you have to be compassion. But if you are still are a person wanting others to love you then it won't work out. How much did you love them? Is your love for another person is doubted? Do you doubt? Then you're not compassion. In that love you may even scold the person, you may even shout at the person. But the love should be there for the benevolence. So the compassion should be for the benevolence of the person. If you're not benevolent, you have not been compassionate. Like spoiling somebody, spoiling your child, spoiling your wife, spoiling your husband. This is not compassion. Compassion is a pure ray of beautiful light of God's love which gives benevolence to another person, hita.

So that should happen to you when you talk of compassion. You go further with the Janah, public. Those people who cannot carry on with Sahaja Yogis are absolutely useless people. These are the cream, these are the best people in the whole world. Of course some are like these, doesn't matter. But they are the topmost people, they are the people wedded to such high ideals. Where do you get anybody with idealism. You go to the UN, you go anywhere you find people, they've no idealism of any kind. It's only for the job, only for the money, or this or that. They are working there. You are the people who have idealism, you are the people who are striving for something higher, you are the people who are going to save the whole world. And those who cannot carry on with Sahaja Yogis and find faults with Sahaja Yogis are really no good for us. They should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

What is your public, is first and foremost is Sahaja Yogis. The rest of them are outsiders so far. But your attitude should be that you have to pull them out. You have to emancipate them, you have to be kind to them, you have to be compassionate and you have to bring them to Sahaja Yoga. You have to be extremely nice to them. But more than that you have to be very, very extremely nice to Sahaja Yogis. I can't understand Sahaja Yogis being nice to others and not to their own clan or you can call, whatever you may call it, to their own brothers and sisters. When I see Sahaja Yogis together loving each other, being kind to each other and also giving some good news about each other I feel extremely happy. That's one of the most joyous time for me. When I find that you are giving...

So then you come to the point where you are in the public, you are in the public. You've to circulate now, you have to articulate in the public, you have to move in the public. You're not only for a secluded, some group of Sahaja Yogis, you're not that. But you have to articulate, you have to circulate. Now for that, what should we do. You have to understand that we have to form other groups, other things by which we can circulate.

Let's see now in England we can form some societies. Let's form some society which are not, which are not are what we call them as the Sahaja Yogas, because you are different from them. So now let us form some societies. We form certain societies, say let us form a society where we talk about the decadence of this country; how the decadence has come in, why it is there, why are we spoiling our young children, why are we behaving like this. Let us see. Let us start a society under this name. Let us start a society which will fight all social problems, like let us I said in India, let us start a society which is against dowry system. That's how you'll circulate with them and later on when they come up to a point they will see your character and then you can talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

Like these women have, what is that called, women lib and all that. That's nonsense you know that very well. But they have formed the society, so they're there, they're circulating. We have to have sensible, wise people forming a society, so from Sahaja Yoga group we have to move to societies, where you need not talk about Sahaja Yoga, you need not tell them there's emancipation, but let us circulate through them and let them know about dharma, forming no religion as such. It's inner religion as we have, just without any religion you can start it. So that's how you meet the public. There are many such ways, which you can think, by which you can meet the public. And then you have to know you are the part and parcel of your Mother.

There are three things asked from God, that there is Salokya, that, "Oh God, I wish should be able to see you." Salokya. Samipya is, "Oh God, let us have your company." And third one is, "Oh God let us, sort of, have a rapport with you." Rapport with you. These are the three things are asked from God. But the fourth thing that has happened to you is Tadatmya, means you have become part and parcel of my body. As a result of that you have to keep your body all right. You have to be pure people. You have to be sensible, otherwise I get into trouble.

It's a very venturesome thing I've done, doesn't matter, I don't mind. But you people look after yourselves. You be sensible people and when you have funny ideas in your head, know that these funny ideas can trouble our Mother very much. So out of love for Me, you have to keep loving yourself. And you can love yourself only if you have pure intelligence to know what is frivolous, what is nonsensical, whatever is a-Sahaj.

So you move like one body, always support each other. If one person is troubled the rest of them should help. That's how the collectivity is going to work out, not to criticize each other, to sit down and just to show off.

So then you rise even higher to this state of Jesus Christ, Mahavira and Buddha. Then what do you have to do? Is Tapah, is the penance. You have to do the penance. Like living in Brahmapuri was a penance, I thought, but you all enjoyed it bit too much. Or Ganapatipule, you thought it was too much. Some people did do some penance by sitting in the sun. But penance means you should be able, penance means sacrifice, sacrifice. Without feeling the sacrifice. Do the work as a sacrifice. You're bound by work. We have to work. Human beings have to work. But the work that is a sacrifice is the most nourishing thing, is the most joy-giving thing. That's what happened. In Brahmapuri I must say it was very spartan. It was both for you and for your hosts. It's quite a funny place to live in and one snake crawled into somebody's shoes I'm told. But still you all enjoyed it because you didn't feel the sacrifice. It was in a way sacrifice for both the parties I think, your hosts and the guests. But you still enjoyed and that's what it is. Now you will enjoy your sacrifices. Apart from all other virtues you'll enjoy your sacrifices. That is one of the quality of the spirit, because you're so detached. You'll enjoy it. So that's how you come to the state of Tapah.

The last is Satya, is the truth. That is what is in the brain as Shri Krishna has described, are the roots where you have to go. Of course, the doors are open to you. You must know that you know the truth. You know the truth, nobody else. Are you aware of this? That you are the only few people under this roof who know the truth, the rest don't know any truth whatsoever. So you have to be compassionate to them, because they're blind, they can't see. As we are kind to the blind people we have to be kind to the people who do not know the truth. You know the truth. And the truth is that you're the spirit. And then you know through all miracles that you are walking in the kingdom of heaven. That you're blessed by God and that you're looked after by Him. So many miracles happen, so many of these that suggest that you are really looked after by God Almighty. So many beautiful things have happened to you. Just think of them one by one from where to where we have come. From down below hell rising up one by one, step by step, now we've come to the brain. Thanks to our Kundalinis that we have come up there. That the Mother has brought you there. This Kundalini which is your Mother has brought you there.

Respect Her. Respect your realization, respect each other and know that you're higher than billions and billions of people of this earth. You're special people and as that you have to behave in the most humble way, respectable and a loving manner. I say love is the highest. Everyone who has developed it, language of love is working out God's wish. Because God's wish, His desire, His icha, that Shakti is the power of love. We work out everything with hatred. "What's wrong with that person, what's wrong with that house, what's wrong with this association, with that?" That is all hatred. But let's see what's good with that, what's nice, what's joyful. When your eyes turn that way, when your attitudes turn like that then you must know that you are Sahajyogis.

For that Christ has given us a big weapon called forgive. Forgive, forgive. And the truth is dawned upon you, you know the truth. Through your vibrations you know, through your vibratory awareness you know. But, there is a very big but for which I have to tell you again and again and I'm telling you again today which is the most important thing for a Sahajyogi is to use your vibratory awareness. They don't, they just don't use their vibratory awareness. In judging others they never use their vibratory awareness, then how do we say they're special people? Because you have the same eyes, you've nose. What about your vibratory awareness. Did you see the vibrations when you did something, you did not? That's why the mistakes. Because these vibrations come as an indication from something that is your spirit which is an absolute thing, which is in absolute state. It is not relative. It's absolute, so whatever information it gives you is absolute and you should take to that absolute understanding. This is where we miss.

So today just before Shiva Puja, Shiva Puja is the puja of the spirit within you. It's the spirit within you. And for this puja specially you have to determine that now we will use our vibratory awareness to judge something. "I think," is not there. "I think," is a wrong idea. I know through vibratory awareness. We have to develop a word for this, which if it says, "I feel," could be something nonsensical. But you really, as they say that in Marathi there's a word, zani. It's a feeling but is a new awareness. Through this awareness, this divine awareness, through that you have to judge everything, to know everything, and to do everything through that. This is what we have to use. And when we start doing that then you will know that God is working out everything for us. It's so simple, life becomes much simpler. All your complications, all your angers, all your troubles, all will vanish as soon as you start using this. Because it is such a universal thing, and such a benevolent blessing. It just makes you wonderful. You become a wonderful personality, happy joyous, straight-forward, open-hearted, fearless. Absolutely enchanting.

May God bless you.
