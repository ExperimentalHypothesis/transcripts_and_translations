Who is going to find out?

[UNCLEAR] Australia or to say your country which is very good at getting all the black money to Switzerland. [UNCLEAR] stupid things are done. What is the need to allow the money to go out of [UNCLEAR] I don't understand cash money, you see that only has a black market. [UNCLEAR] maybe taxation binds military things. You tax someone all right, your tax for something sensible, nobody minds but for buying military things and then seeking [UNCLEAR] What's the use? While your hard-earned money the taxpayer is going in the see of [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] Where are you two going? She is buying all these materials, more materials, [UNCLEAR] finished. Then, its also, you see, a double solver also these horrible Argentinians people who killed their own people are being punished now. All these dictators are [UNCLEAR] punished.

That's a very good thing. They needed some punishment. Why is she the person who is harmed because she was collecting She started this, and another is America. [UNCLEAR] be in trouble. [I will see that UNCLEAR] very soon. Russia is in trouble too. It will work out, you will see that. You don't realize how [UNCLEAR] She [UNCLEAR] for ten people [UNCLEAR] finished. I will get you small plates for biscuits and cheese Mother. May I keep this as prasad?

I think now there will be a revolution. in Argentina and [Chile ? UNCLEAR] In Argentina and Chile. [UNCLEAR] Did you follow? She just doesn't follow. What's the matter? I said there will be a revolution now. I don't know. [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] It's too good. You see But no communism.

You see the trouble was these people were going to communism. If they had gone for democracy, [UNCLEAR] Because communism is no solution at all. It's much worse than dictatorship. [UNCLEAR]

Yogi: The communist does not believe in God.

Shri Mataji Not at all. [UNCLEAR] What's the use of having communism?

Yogi: They are very materialistic even.

Shri Mataji Very materialistic. And this was the mistake of Chile people and Argentina people to ask for communism. Communist wouldn't even know what has happened.

Nice to see communism from far. How communism? That was a mistake. Chile people are so stupid. They don't understand what communism is. Russia will just come and sit on their head. Whatever happened to Poland see. Czechoslovakia finished, Poland finished. It could finish too. Afghanistan tried to [UNCLEAR] something.

They are sitting on their heads now. Only the Indians are saved.

Yogi: Now the church.

Yogi: The Church in Chile, they are very political Mother.

Shri Mataji Church?

Yogi:Yes. [UNCLEAR] What about your Pope? [UNCLEAR] a political stunt. He said,"I don't want any war." I mean, who wants war?

What is the need to say, "I don't want any war"? But give some solution. What is the solution? I don't want to be involved, everything is to be done peacefully. For that you don't need a Pope to say that. Church is for teaching them Capitalism.

Yogi: Catholic .. How they? from the left people..

Yogi: Communist people Mother. They [help?] the Communist.

The communist people they [killed?] They killed this and they killed this, that's all. So, they are just the same. What was your Mother's [UNCLEAR] Communism? That's [UNCLEAR] stupidity. [UNCLEAR believe in communism. [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR]

Yogi: In 1970 until 1970, I was [UNCLEAR] this [UNCLEAR] I was very active in Politics. Because my mother [UNCLEAR] and myself to do politics since. So [UNCLEAR] and myself you were communist? I was [UNCLEAR] You worked for communist that time?

I was socialist. Yes communist. See, now you see the stupidity of communism is there. Complete. That was the mistake. [UNCLEAR] They don't understand God at all. They are absurd people. Sahaja yoga would have never reached to [UNCLEAR] were a communist. Of course, now, you have given up all your political. [UNCLEAR] He too was.

I was never very much into.

Shri Mataji But your brothers and sisters, were [UNCLEAR] ? He is married. Wendy is Geraldo's sister. Wendy is married with my brother, so the relation is, he is my My brother is married with Geraldo's sister.

Shri Mataji Rodrigo is your brother?

Shri Mataji So Rodrigo's wife is Wendy?

Yogi: Yes. [Yogis and Mataji talk about relations] [UNCLEAR] All these things should be understood in the light of the spirit. It's difficult to understand.

Without democracy you cannot have realization. Cannot work out. I cannot go to any country which is communist. And do Sahaja yoga. Nor can I go to any country where there is [UNCLEAR] rule So both are useless. Only democratic countries we can work out. We have thought we have done, you see, We have gone to France, Portugal, all these people are democratic. [UNCLEAR] communism had [UNCLEAR] This is what it is. Very wrong misleading things these are. The car fellow was just changing everything he was cheating.

All increasing decreasing, ever expanding, every sort of thing, you know.
