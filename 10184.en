Who is going to find out?

[UNCLEAR:They must have stolen them.] Australia or to say your country which is very good at getting [taking] all the black money to Switzerland. [UNCLEAR  - there's other] stupid things are done. What is the need to allow the money to go out of [UNCLEAR: England] I [just] don’t understand. Cash money you see that only has  black market. [UNCLEAR] Maybe taxation binds [buys] military things. You tax someone all right, [you] your tax for something sensible, nobody minds but for buying military things and then seeking [UNCLEAR: Falkland] What’s the use? While your hard-earned money the taxpayer is going in the see of [ sea of Falkland] UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] Where are you two going? She is buying all these materials, [war] more materials, [UNCLEAR: is] finished. Then, its also, you see,it's  a double solver also these horrible Argentinian people who killed their own people are being punished now. All these dictators are [UNCLEAR nicely] punished.

That’s a very good thing. They needed some punishment. And why is she the person who is harmed because she was collecting.  She started this, and another is America. [UNCLEAR which is doing the same thing] It will be in trouble. [ UNCLEAR:They will see that] very soon. Russia is in trouble too. It will work out, you will see that. You don’t realise how [UNCLEAR] She [UNCLEAR gave Me] for ten people [UNCLEAR can I tell you] finished.

Sahaja Yogini:I will get you little plates for biscuits and cheese Mother.

Shri Mataji: I have no space left.

Sahaja Yogini: May I keep this as prasad?

I think now there will be a revolution. in Argentina and [Chile ? UNCLEAR] In Argentina and Chile. [UNCLEAR] Did you follow? She just doesn’t follow. What’s the matter? I said there will be a revolution now. I don’t know. [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [It will be. You will see.] It’s too good. You will see.

But no communism. You see the trouble was these people were going to [in for] communism. If they had gone for democracy, [UNCLEAR] Because communism is no solution at all. It’s much worse than dictatorship. [UNCLEAR]

Yogi: The communist does not believe in God.

Shri Mataji Not at all.  So what’s the use of having communism?

Yogi: They are very materialistic even.

Shri Mataji Very materialistic. And this was a mistake of Chile people and Argentina people to ask for communism. Communists [you] wouldn’t even know what has happened.

Nice to see communism from far. How communism? That was a mistake. Chile people are so stupid. They don’t understand what communism is. Russia will just come and sit on their head. Whatever happened to Poland see. Czechoslovakia finished, Poland finished. It could finish too. Afghanistan tried to [UNCLEAR] something. They are sitting on their heads now. Only the Indians are saved.

Yogi: Now the church.  The Church in Chile, they are very political Mother.

Shri Mataji: Church?

Yogi:Yes. [UNCLEAR] What about your Pope? [UNCLEAR” He himself did ] a political stunt. He said,”I don’t want any war.” I mean, who wants war? What is the need to say, “I don’t want any war”? But give some solution. What is the solution? I don’t want to be involved, everything is to be done peacefully. For that you don’t need a Pope to say that. Church is for [what -]  teaching them Capitalism.

Yogi: Catholic .. How they? from the left people..

Yogi: Communist people Mother. They [help?] the Communist.

The communist people they [killed?] They killed this and they killed this, that’s all. So, they are just the same. What was your Mother’s [UNCLEAR thought. What did she believe in -] Communism? That’s [UNCLEAR: They are so stupid] stupidity. [UNCLEAR to believe in communism. [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR]

Yogi: In 1970 until 1973, I was [UNCLEAR] this [UNCLEAR] I was very active in Politics. Because my mother [UNCLEAR: teach Geraldo] and myself to do politics [things Mother] since. So [UNCLEAR] and myself you were communist? I was [UNCLEAR] You worked for communist that time?

I was socialist. Yes communist.

Shri Mataji: See, now you see the stupidity of communism is there. Complete. That was a mistake. [UNCLEAR They are very materialistic] They don’t understand God at all. They are absurd people. Sahaja yoga would have never reached to [UNCLEAR: If you] were a communist. Of course, now, you have given up all your political. [UNCLEAR] He too was.

Sahaja Yogi: I was never very much into.

Shri Mataji But your brothers and sisters, were [UNCLEAR] ? He is married. Wendy is Geraldo’s sister. Wendy is married with my brother, so we are relations , he is my My brother is married with Geraldo’s sister.

Shri Mataji Rodrigo is your brother?

Shri Mataji So Rodrigo’s wife is Wendy?

Yogi: Yes. [ She is his sister. Yogis and Mataji talk about relations] [UNCLEAR] All these things should be understood in the light of the Spirit. It’s difficult to understand.

Without democracy you cannot have realisation. Cannot work out. I cannot go to any country which is communist and do Sahaja yoga. Nor can I go to any country where there is [UNCLEAR despotic] rule So both are useless. Only democratic countries we can work out. We have thought we have done, [That's what we have done] you see, We have gone to France, Portugal, all these people are democratic. [UNCLEAR: If communism had come] This is what it is. Very wrong misleading things these are.

The car fellow was just changing everything. He was cheating. First he said something, and [then] he changed everything [these] horrible people.

Sahaja Yogi: They are always trying to get your money.[in Spain ]

Shri Mataji: Spanish, you see, have worse worst are these [UNCLEAR]. what you call Italians. They are the worst, terrible. Portuguese are very good people compared to Spanish actually. They are very good people, they don’t cheat you, they trust you. They are very good people. We went to [UNCLEAR: this] place [UNCLEAR Rome.] We wanted to buy some marble [UNCLEAR] small small pieces of marble First, they said [UNCLEAR so much] [UNCLEAR so much] I mean really went on. All increasing decreasing, ever expanding, every sort of thing, you know.

I got so fed up. Two or three shops I went to[UNCLEAR I said, give up] these people,[are] horrible. Such a waste of time, you see. Then I just thought I said, “If the Italians” [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] she [UNCLEAR: did it] in 5 minutes. Got the whole thing very cheap. Such liars actually, terrible liars. I said this, I said that, unnecessary. Where have we [you] parked the car? It’s convenient.

Yogi: I have just received [UNCLEAR a phone call] from England.

I have just received a phone call from England. My wife, she has been bleeding and they don’t know what is ...?

Shri Mataji She has been bleeding?

Yogi:Yes Mother.

Shri Mataji How many months it is?

Yogi:It’s five months Mother.

Shri Mataji That’s very [UNCLEAR: common with ladies] is such a common trouble.

Shri Mataji Many reasons are there for that. Some of them is that, they use those pills, you see. She may be alright. Anyway it is common [UNCLEAR is] bleeding Who else? I mean everybody had [has] this trouble. She is [getting too much UNCLEAR: bending too much] She said it was quite a lot. She said it was quite a lot and if it carried on tonight, they would take her to hospital.

Shri Mataji: It’s an ordinary case. Nothing so extraordinary. [Was there too ]Is it too much or less?

Yogi: She said it was a lot.

Yogi: She said it was a lot.

Shri Mataji It was a lot?

Shri Mataji: She talked to you?

Yogi: Yes Mother, she called [phoned] me.

Shri Mataji Now what did she [UNCLEAR: telephone to you?] What do you [UNCLEAR] You should have told her that if you have done sahaja yoga. [ it would have been better.] Should have been better. Did you say that? Pray to Mother?

Yogi: I did say Mother. [When]  She was having all these troubles because she doesn’t do sahaja yoga. How did you get the [UNCLEAR phone, where] ?

Yogi: When I was, told [Mother]  to call urgently to England.

Shri Mataji: Also she might have lifted something, or something like that, you see. [UNCLEAR: Little big is alright,] I can’t understand too much. Because they start little bit little bit like that you see. It’s suddenly too much then there must be something she has done. With [ She's been] careless [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji What about your father?

Yogini: He is in Chile now.

Yogi: He is [UNCLEAR divorced] with my mother. He is divorced. He separated to my mother.

He live in Chile Mother.

Yogi:Yes Mother. You remember him ? He left when you were young or ?

Yogi: Actually, my mother left him because he was horrible. In 1970 [UNCLEAR: he made horrible life for us, so my mother say] better for us children to separate him, And she separate, otherwise we would be crazy. [UNCLEAR with my father. He shout my mother. He shout us] [UNCLEAR] last two years. I write him and I tell him sahaja yoga [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji When did she join politics? Your mother?

Sahaja Yogini: My mother was very political, so that’s why they are in trouble. he doesn’t [UNCLEAR believe] in politicals. [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji She [UNCLEAR So when did she join the politics.?] communist?

Yogi:[when she was very young Mother] from when my mother was 25, something like that. [UNCLEAR]

In modern times we  cannot cater for people like that.
