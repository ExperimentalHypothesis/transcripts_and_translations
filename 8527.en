Shri Gruhalakshmi Puja, Brompton Square 1985-0805
So, this is to thank you all for helping in building this house and making it so beautiful. All the thankfulness is from us, both of us, to you.
Today is a very interesting day when you are worshipping the Gruhalakshmi here, with the Gruhalakshmi of this house. In the same way, in your families, also, in your houses, homes, you must do Gruhalakshmi’s puja. The woman has to be the Gruhalakshmi herself and then she should be worshipped: यत्र नार्य पूज्यन्ते तत्र रमन्ते देवता (yatra narya pujante, tatra ramante devata) where the women are respected and worshipped there reside all the deities. But they should be respectable also. If they are not respectable then the deities won't reside there.
It’s is a big responsibility on a Gruhalakshmi to be respectable, so that all the deities are happy in the family. And once she is respected she will try to be respectable also. So the respect of the Gruhalakshmi is very important.
Today we are having this little puja from all the builders who helped us here, with the blessings of Vishwakarma and Brahmadeva; those who have tried to make this house so beautiful.
Also, as you know, Blake has described this house. It has a special significance and we have to now hand it over to somebody else, the one who will appreciate and respect this house; who will understand the value and worth of this house. And for that we have to pray that it will be sold to such a person who is a person who will be a cogniser, a person who will understand the depth and the aesthetics of this place and the one who will be paying for that, valuing that. So we have to ask for such a blessing.
Of course one should not get attached to anything. Whatever is created, is created. One should never be attached. Because we have done this, so we should be attached to it, is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should think about it. But one should think about that, now we have created something beautiful we can recreate another thing and we can produce other better things. That’s how an artist can go on producing and producing.
Of course there’s one thing: that if there is within us the joy, then only you produce joy. If there is no joy you cannot. So first of all before doing any work creating anything one must measure up the amount of joy one has received, the blessings one has received from the Divine, and then recreate. With that consciousness, with that awareness you’ll find your creation will be very beautiful. And we have to bring the world to a new method of creativity where there is exuberance, exuberance, of joy and of Divine aesthetics, because the world is going from bad to worse. I find nowadays people may just like to have some sort of a white cloth hanging and calling it a painting. That’s not a painting because there is nothing inside. It has become hollow, empty; there’s nothing inside it, so that there is no exuberance. So to recreate that, you people have to desire and ask for it, and we’ll have people of that kind. It is just to be desired, and you all should desire for such things: that people of exuberance should come forward to value such things which are full of joy.
May God Bless you all.
And so what is this, first the Ganesha puja we’ll do? Hmm?

After the puja
You shouldn’t eat all these things. I have done such a good cooking! (laughter) I have to say you shouldn’t eat anything anymore because if you eat it then I’ll just vibrate it, but you people don’t eat anything now because such a lot has been cooked, OK? (laughter) Such nice food.
(Sahaja Yogis put on a cassette of music from Anup Jalota)
More than that, ahead of that.
Dhanya: Play it forward
Gavin Brown: Yes, tell him.
Yogi: Is it before this or after this?
Gavin: No after, further on.
(Mother translates the poetry of a bhajan by Anup Jalota while they listen to the bhajan)
Shri Mataji: There’s a nice song which says that, in the love of the bhaktas, how God does little, little things to please the bhaktas. And it’s a very good thing which you’ll like it very much; which is to be translated and you can...(Sahaja Yogis are fast forwarding the audio cassette)...You see, this is the one but start it from the [beginning]. And he says: God thinks that, my respect may be less, doesn’t matter but I cannot let down my disciples. I may have to come down but I cannot let down my disciples, my people who are my bhaktas.
Just little, just bring it [closer], I can’t hear it properly. There’s a switch there (to plug it in). Begin it again, I’ll tell you [what it means]. Bring it here. It’s a very interesting [bhajan].
Come forward!  Till they prepare for your food down below. You see it will take half an hour at least.
Come forward! Come! Come here! Come here!
Today Mr. Shrivastava has become a Sahaj Yogi! And he now belongs to our Sahaja Nirmala Dharm so it’s all right.
Sir C.P. Shrivastava: Thank you!
Shri Mataji: We have already registered ourselves as Vishwa Nirmala Dharm!
(Bhajan restarts)
Start it from the beginning. (Yogi starts it after the beginning). Start it earlier.
Come forward! Come here! You can remove this chair!
This is for the devotees of God, what he does is to keep the word of the bhaktas; not to let down the bhaktas. So he comes down to every level, just to support them, just to make them feel happy. To every level; for his devotees.
Put a chair also for Mr. Shrivastava there. He might come back. It’s all right, it’s all right. At the back. Keep it there.
This is a nice one. This is just the notes.
The force of great love of his devotees, palay (पलाय)is a word [which means] entrapped by that: love of the devotees. God has to change his laws, in the force of love of God. This is Mahamaya! God changes His laws with the force of the love of his devotees. Whether people respect or not, whether His respect is challenged or not, but in the respect of the bhaktas He knows that he should not be let down. Disciples, or you can call them the devotees.
Now he describes how Shri Krishna has done it or the God has done it:
By only a glance of the grace [of Shri Krishna] the whole universe is sustained: means one glance of the grace of that God. And such a God we have seen Him in Gokul, dancing over, asking for the butter. Just imagine! For Him the whole world He nourishes, but here it is He is just crying for butter, in Gokul, just to please His Mother.
The one, Shambu is Mahadeva, the Viranchi is the Brahmadeva. All the devas, Sanak is the very great, high, spiritually evolved personality, could not get into meditation towards him, and he is playing here with the little boys who are ordinary cowherds. The one who cannot even meditate [on Shri Krishna], Viranchi is Brahmadeva, Shambu is Mahadeva: They cannot even get into meditate [on Him]: Suresh, Ganesh, Mahesh and everybody. They think of God but they cannot go beyond Him. But here He is, He’s being driven mad by a few gopis who have some little buttermilk to offer to Him. Very good poetry!
The feet, whose feet are under the guidance of Kamala, means the Lakshmi: She is the one who is holding His feet while sitting down. He can’t get out of it [her grip]. He cannot take out His feet out of Her powers. The one who is even looked after by Shri Lakshmi, such a Person, such a God, you have seen His feet walking on the thorns of Gokul. Where he was walking there were thorns; in His bare feet, He was walking there. Such a God, who’s feet are pressed even by Shri Lakshmi, for his bhaktas, because they were all his bhaktas there. Like me in London!
By only a little raising of one of His eyebrows, seven seas start boiling.
Then he describes, Bindu is the poet, such a great poet...such a great power of God that just lifting one of His eyebrows he makes seven seas to boil.
(To Mr CP Shrivastava) Aap aye, aap aye. (Please come, please come).
There He, with the Mother Yeshoda’s fear, He drops the little drops of tears (bindu).
(To Mr CP Shrivastava) Ashru kya kahata hai? (Hindi: How do you say teardrops?)
Mr CP Shrivastava: Drops.
His (the poet’s) name is also ‘drop’ (bindu), so he puts it that way.
From his eyes He drops the little, little drops of ‘bindu’. So from where to where? He can make seven seas to boil and here, there are tear drops, just like bindus from His eyes, just to please His Mother.
Just go and ask Danya, she brought a very good article (in the newspaper) and something from Kahlil Gibran.
(Listening to the music which is a song of Kabir)
‘Chadariya’ is this body. Which he has woven, because was a himself, Kabira, a weaver. So he describes weaving; that, this body was woven. ‘Bini’ means woven. ‘In the name of Rama I have made this body’. He was a Ram bhakta.
Yogi: Do you want us to massage your feet Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: You can just bring some ice. Get one little towel and put some ice in it and then break it, then you have to also rub it (her feet) with that.
He says, “This body is a sheath in the form of this body.” There are eight lotuses that is chakras, and five elements. Chakka is the one which you spin it, made out of eight lotuses, and five elements together. That’s how it was woven for nine to ten months. But the stupid have spoiled it. When my sheet came, brought in the house...I mean he is describing his guru as the person who gives the colour to the sheet.
After wearing this  coloured sheet, you should not get into doubts about your guru. The one who has given you the colour, you should not doubt that. Don’t think this body is yours. The guru has coloured it. He’s given you for two days only. You should not doubt. The stupid, those who do not know the secret. Every day they go on spoiling this sheet - these are the stupid!
Kabira knew only one or two abuses, one was ‘stupid’! (Laughing)
This is Raag Desh.
He says, “Poor Prahlad and Sudama, they also got the same body.”
[Raag] Kedar hai. (Now this is Raag Kedar)
(Talking to Mark Beaven who is massaging her feet) Alright? Are you feeling alright in the hands?
Mark Beaven: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Gavin? This is Malkauns Raag. You must send prasad to all the ashrams. Alright?
(Talking to another yogi) Pay attention here (pointing to her bindi).
No, no. Paul, just see here (pointing to her bindi again).
Now better.
Better.
Eyes also. Do it a little bit with the eyes, pressure it. (Mother is explaining to close the eyes tightly to the person whom she asked to look at her bindi). See, it’s better now. Pressure on the eyes.
(Mother then holds her hamsa between her thumb and index finger, then puts her hand above her Sahastrar gesturing to others to do the same.)
Take a bandhan and raise your Kundalinis. Take a bandhan. First take a bandhan I think.
First take a bandhan then raise the Kundalini now.
(Mother is giving a bandhan for a long time for the house to be sold to someone deserving.)
Give a bandhan to this house to see people.
Aah, done! Now see (the Kundalini above your head).
See on CP’s head also. [Is it] there? Tie it up!
(Mother translates the next song on the cassette.)
“The person who gets place in this world is the one who comes at your feet. This is Saraswati’s bhajan.”
Should we come down? Food is ready? Accha let’s just finish then.
“I am completely surrendered. My heart is surrendered, my voice is surrendered. Shraddha, devotion, all emotions are surrendered. “
Surprising, only to the Mother they ask for blessings.
This is Saraswati bhajan.
In India ‘sang’ means ‘holy’ and ‘geet’ is the ‘music’.  So nothing is higher than holy music, divine music.
“When the ocean starts calling you, then Sahaj you fill them up with Godliness.”
“She’s the veena player. She gives us the blessings.” “Gives eternal music ‘shaswati’ ”
“Then get the new life. When you get blessings, one gets the new life.”
“Sahaja swayam bhagavan mile” “To them, Sahaja, God, means sakshat, they see the sakshat of God, in person. For such people.”
Chalo, let’s go and have food. You are the host CP you better call them!

Shri Mataji Reads from Kahlil Gibran, Jesus, The Son of Man. This recording is not on the video. Is it recorded later on or downstairs in the dining room?
“Were it not for a mother’s desire I would have stripped me of the swaddling-clothes and escaped back to space.
And were it not for sorrow in all of you I would not have stayed to weep. “Who are you and what are you, Judas Iscariot? And why do you tempt me?
“Have you in truth weighed me in the scale and found me one to lead legions of pygmies, and to direct chariots of the shapeless against an enemy that encamps only in your hatred and marches nowhere but in your fear?
Shri Mataji: Means you have enemies within yourself.
“Too many are the worms that crawl about me feet, and I will give them no battle. I am weary of the jest, and weary of pitying the creepers who deem me coward because I will not move among their guarded walls and towers.
“Pity it is that I must needs pity to the very end. Would that I could turn my steps towards a larger world where larger men dwell. But how shall I?
Shri Mataji: And then he said about the future, OK?
“Your priest and your emperor would have my blood. They shall be satisfied ere I go hence. I would not change the course of the law. And I would not govern folly.
Shri Mataji: Because you see the course of the law that he was crucified.
“Let ignorance reproduce itself until it is weary of its own offspring.
“Let the blind lead the blind to the pitfall.
“And let the dead bury the dead till the earth be choked with its own bitter fruit.
“My kingdom is not of the earth. My kingdom shall be where two or three of you shall meet in love, and in wonder at the loveliness of life, and in good cheer, and in remembrance of me.”
Shri Mataji: This is collectivity. This is collectivity, just understand
“My kingdom is not of the earth. My kingdom shall be where two or three of you shall meet in love, and in wonder at the loveliness of life, and in good cheer, and in remembrance of me.”
Then of a sudden He turned to Judas, and He said, “Get you behind me, man. Your kingdoms shall never be in my kingdom.”
Shri Mataji: Kya Kahlil Gibran! It’s tremendous!
May God bless you all!
There are so many things written already to encourage us to be walking the right path of our Spirit. We should never get desperate or discouraged. There’s so much already said about it.
May God bless you!
