1987-07-12 Evening after Guru Puja, Shudy Camps, UK[After the concert ]

Shri Mataji: They have to thank all of us Debu Chaudhary who is one of us who have played the divine Music for the entertainment of our spirit ...I wish from here, many of you take inspiration and go deep down into the arts that you know and develop beautiful things for the entertainment of our spirit ...May God bless him and may God bless Subhash who is such a good player and will come up very fast I am sure. He has very delicate finger touches and I am sure he will have other dimensions to this instrument of Tabla ...We have many types of Tabla players. And everyone has some speciality and this one I am sure will play certain moods that they call it in the tabla like "Chakardar" and "Dhirkat" and all that ...He is very good at all that ...May God bless him for that ...And professor Chaudhary, I shouldn't call him professor He is just Debu to me but his speciality is more of composition Which he should take to the composition because he really makes such beautiful compositions that I haven't heard anybody making that beautiful composition...And if he can do those compositions one day all over the world he will be known very well for all that because it touches your heart. the way he does his compositions...They have asked me to give a little token of your love just a little bit for them and to ask for forgiveness if it is very little ...So that we can express our-selves...May God bless them... both of them ...And We all thank them for our hearts.

Helen where are the children they are coming na ...Alright, thank you very much for coming ...:)This mike is alright Let them have it ...hereSir C.P: After this divine music I am sure you are no more listen to speech and I am not making a speech at all ...I dare not ...and I do not wish to either but before taking leave I did want to say how grateful I am to all of you for permitting me and my daughter and my granddaughter to be in the midst of this wonderful gathering. When we came yesterday I saw those divine expressions on your faces ...I felt elevated ...In my childhood days, we use to hear some stories of mythology We were told that sometimes from earth miss rays went to heaven and from heaven, they came to earth but on 21 st March 1923 Someone was born here on this earth to bring heaven to earth itself...To be admitted to this heaven is a wonderful privilege. Its a bliss, its an experience, which I should always cherish I do want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Wish you the very best ...You have the very best ...How can I wish anything better? All I can say is I pray you to keep it up, spread the message, the world needs you ...the world is in desperate trouble When I am here I have hope Sometimes i do feel and I am not in this world the world that I am here today in...I feel desperate, for the world is in trouble so much strive so much trouble but fortunately, I got transported in this another world here today ...Now to go back to that world is not easy! For this evening I also want to thank professor Debu Chaudhary my wife and I both made a very special request to him to play these wonderful ragas. As this was your Mataji I say your because you know how it is ...She is my wife also ...:)Prof. Chaudhary's music was divine ...I was pure nectar I thank you from the bottom of my heart and I will carry those glint that divinity with me back to us. Thank you very much!Sahaja Yogi: So, Sir C.P 1:56:54 said very few words in reply to all. Very eloquence and very moving speech, which is like on the behalf of the whole of the Sahaja yogis gathered here ...1:57:14Thank you very much for coming!1:58:10 (cut in video )Shri Mataji: Who is a master of this art 2:00:45 and then he goes to the master and stays with the master ...And then the master teaches with different melodies ...Composed of different notes...So these melodies are composed of since a long time ...They were composed before the Vedas ...Because they have seen on the kundalini itself because they were composed by the saints...They have seen that the notes which are congenial to the rising of the kundalini because there are seven notes we have In the same way there are seven chakras ...So they have seen that it is congenial ...And that's how only the melody is made...The difference in the south and north music is this :In the south, the notes, one note from one to the another is also divided into many parts is called as "shrutis ".That 's why it goes little more I should say into more notes ...into finer notes ... And may not be much appealing to some people but in the north especially in meditation people have discovered these melodies which were congenial and that's how all these notes put together in a particular manner rising and descending ...They are called as ragas ...as the melodies! Now, these are built up since long. Now, these ragas are brought down in generations of generations according to the dynasty they call it ...called as "Gharana 's". Every great artist if you go and ask him what is your Gharana he will tell you that this is the dynasty and that's how they work out in a dynasty ...In a particular Gharana, they have particular style another Gharana they have another style ...Then these ragas are played before the gurus. The gurus teach how to play them, how to do all the permutations and combinations ...for years together ...Sometimes they start from the age of 10 years going up to the age of 25 and 26 years minimum ...And then they start coming to the public, to the audience, to play. The audience is also very conversant, they aren't playing any wrong otherwise they will not like it ...they will get up and walk out. so like that these ragas are played a very traditionally.After that now there are two types of ragas which are very well known ...900 melodies are well known and there are many others which are very unknown. Which are composed like this but they also have to be very careful to see that the composition should be such that the combination of the raga should be blended very well, completely integrated. And that's how these different ragas are meant. Then the artist when he is matured enough, will start playing a raga and he has all the freedom to do what he likes with the permutations and the combinations ...but he has to keep the "maryada" of that raga. It's like you built up a beautiful plane or a beautiful ship which is absolutely seaworthy.Then allow it to go where ever it likes In the same way but the ship has to be fully equipped ...and together otherwise nothing will be left out of that ship...In western music, you also had the same style, to begin with ...Then it was changed over by certain geniuses was a good idea ...To compose beautiful poems and out of that they got inspiration and they started composing ...I mean... I would say the manifestation of those ideas in the poem or the poetry ...or a drama to express the drama in the music so that they tried to make the "sakara " into the form into a formless ...And that formless thing starts moving ...But now It has reached such shores that I don't know what to say: Because they just hold the mike and jump on it and I don't know what they sing God does not know...In the same way In Indian Music, also a lot of deterioration has taken place no doubt, and our modern generation likes shouting music very much. And You are taking to classical Indian music and they are taking to this shouting music ...If there is the shouting music in the big big hotels in India people are charged about a thousand rupees as the fees. I think you should start some money earning compositions...:) Actually, we were thinking of having a Sahaja disco club in Pune ...:)I am getting one of you there to sing the song in that fashion but Sahaja yoga ...With my photographs covered with thin paper and singing the song of Sahaja Yoga. And they won't understand what are they listening to, and making a big money out of it. There is no harm in befooling people like that...If they are fools what can you befool them ...they are already fools Like Krishna has said they are already dead, I said they are already fools. How can you befool them any more? That is how Indian Music is also coming down ...And they have adopted many many absurd kinds of music from outside. But I must say that it is very close to the deities and deities understand them That's why you start getting the vibrations So if you could appreciate it slowly through your heart, through your spirit, you will enjoy it, you will like it. May God bless you!

Its a beginning of a new drama system and a very good idea because I used to like drama and plays in my childhood. I am very happy somebody has taken up this side of life which is very important And it is very communicating ...A day will come you might form a very wonderful drama society and may go to the whole world to announce the advent of Sahaja yoga.
