5th Day of Navaratri Celebrations, “Guru Tattwa (Mahima) and Shri Krishna,” Mumbai (India), 26 September 1979

[Hindi to English translation]

All those who have come to the previous three lectures of Sahaja Yoga, they will be able to understand much easier because the place of the guru is very high within us. The place of the guru is situated within us; there is nothing new to do in it. The instruments that the Divine has created, this instrument has been made with great beauty. Each of its chakras, which are invisible to us but are within us, through which we realise that this visual world has been beautifully created. But man lives in excess, always going to extremes; he has spoiled his own instrument. Similarly, the place of the guru has also been spoiled in a bad way by man.

The place of the guru within us. In this entire place or province, in this entire country, there is guru’s place – inside the abdomen, all around, connected to the Nabhi Chakra. A day ago, I spoke to you about the Nabhi Chakra and I had described the powers of Vishnu and it is due to the power of Vishnu that you have evolved from amoeba to human. And it is through that same power that you are going to become superhumans from humans. Now, the power of the guru that is already placed within us by the Divine, for this purpose, many gurus have incarnated within us.

Now, first let’s see how this guru principle is formed. For this, we should understand that the Guru principle is timeless and how it was created. Within us, three powers operate invisibly. The first power is what we call the power of Shri Mahakali, let’s say the power of your existence, by which you have your existence. The existence of this creation, the existence in this world, that power is of Mahakali, which flows within our Ida Nadi. The location of this Ida Nadi is on our left, which should be said to be on the left side, and the left-side Ida Nadi keeps the left-side sympathetic nervous system functioning. Therefore, our left-side Ida Nadi gives us desires. It is through desire that a person acts. So the second one, which is the Pingala Nadi, which is on the right side, gives us the power of action. We call this the power of Shri MahaSaraswati.

So, we have one power of Mahakali and the other power we have is of MahaSaraswati. Because we cannot say their names in English, many people think that this is a highly unscientific matter. But there can be no science greater than this. Because what you haven’t seen, what is different for you, what is inconspicuous, you don’t know about it. You may have seen what it is superficially, but you haven’t known the power behind it, so just by even talking about it you cannot believe in it. But in Sahaja Yoga, when the Kundalini is awakened, when the Kundalini starts rising upwards, then you can see how due to the imbalance of these two nadis and various other faults, Kundalini stops, and how it must be balanced again. These two powers are supported by a third power, which is important, which is what we have earned .

Today, the level at which our human consciousness has reached is indicative of the third power: it is the power of MahaLakshmi. It is with this power that we have evolved from amoeba to human today. What was the problem if humans had remained as amoebas only? And what calamity had occurred that humanity had to evolve through so many species, today, God has created this beautiful form of humans? Have you ever thought why God made us human? What specialty is within us that we have no information about as yet? We don’t even know, we don’t even have an idea why we came into this world, why this instrument made in a special way, called human, was created. This human must first understand that today we have reached a state where human consciousness has reached through this power of Mahalakshmi within us. A day ago, in Dadar, I had told you about these three powers in detail. So, I am not going to speak much about these three powers. But these three powers are within us, and when there is harmony among these three powers, when these three powers come together, and when the child-like form of these three powers is born, this is something that cannot be corrupted by anything, in which there can be no imperfection, no ego can arise, which always remains fresh – this element is the Guru principle.

A child does not have ego. A child does not have attachment to anything; he remains completely detached. You see, young children play, make a lot of drama, create various things, then they kick it and leave. Or they play for a little while, engage in pretend play, and then it’s all over. Everything is a drama for them. And they talk like a third person. Tell them: “Kids, now go home,” they talk like someone else, saying, “This Munna will not go. This Munna here won’t go.” For them, this little one is someone else. They always talk like a third person. And as this person grows up, slowly two nodules or two particular types of institutions are formed inside him, which we call ego and superego in English. These are developed within us by the use of powers of desire and action. If a person is filled with excessive power of desire and keeps desiring all the time, then the power named super-ego is formed within him.

It should be said that this institution manifests and that institution makes its way into our heads, around here, and settles here as shown here. The second institution arises within us from the power of action, which we call “Ahankar” and in English we call it ego. This is born within every human being who performs any kind of action. The meaning of this institution is that a person thinks “I did this work, I built this house, I build this home.” When a sense of being a doer emerges in his mind toward that thing, it is from that sense of being a doer that this institution of ego is formed. When these two institutions go and settle one on top of the other in the fontanel area in the middle of the head, then the calcification sets in there. Our fontanel bone area gets filled up completely by the age of three, four years in our childhood. But it gets completely full actually when we start speaking the language well and gain mastery over language. Then it sets in properly. There are many reasons for this too.

But today we are talking about the Guru principle. Now, this Guru principle is the harmony of these three powers: MahaKali, MahaLakshmi, and MahaSaraswati. This is a completely new form in which the Supreme Being has manifested within us. You already know how Lord Dattatreya’s birth happened; I don’t need to tell you about it again. But it is absolutely correct that just as the three powers of Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh stood before the Purity, then the Purity bestowed them with newness, gave them innocence. These three powers filled with innocence, which are within one Dattatreyaji, are settled in our abdomen, which we should say, submerged in what we call the ocean of illusion. This power is contained in the ocean of illusion in the Virata and takes birth many times.

Since ancient times, this Adinatha was also incarnation of this power. It is the same power that takes birth many times. Adinathaji, who is still worshipped by Jains and they respect Him. But they do not know the meaning of this power. Firstly, the thing about this power is that there is no religious fanaticism in it. There is no caste of a monk; they have no caste. The meaning of a monk is that he accepts all castes, all religions. And if any guru considers himself an actor of any particular religion, then it should be understood that he is not a guru. The first power of Guru principle is that he must be full of all the essence, freshness, innocence and crux of all religions. If any human puts himself forward in the name of a religious guru, then it should be understood that this is a false person and the religion behind him is also a great falsehood.

We can give you an example of this in Sahaja Yoga and you can easily understand. There is a gentleman who came to meet us when we were in London. He started saying, “Mother, I have cancer in my stomach, please cure it.” He is a Muslim, residing from Iran, and a doctor. I asked him what he believes in, and he said he believes in Mohammed Sahib. I asked, “Only in Mohammed Sahib?” He said, “Yes.” “Not in anyone else?” He replied, “No, not in anyone else.” So I said, “I cannot cure your stomach cancer. Forgive Me. Because it is caused by such religious fanaticism that only Mohammed Sahib is the solution.”

Mohammed Sahib is, He is also an incarnation of Dattatreya, completely and nothing else. I mean, He is himself an incarnation of Dattatreya, there is no doubt about it, but He is not the only incarnation. That’s why Mohammed Sahib, settled in stomach, got annoyed with him. Understand, if you are the president of this country and when you come to Maharashtra, people show respect to you because you are the president, and if you go to Bengal and people don’t respect you, won’t the president sahib get angry with you? Similarly, this same power comes multiple times in different births, and when it takes multiple births, although its names are different, its place are different, this power takes birth in this world as per the need. But it should never be assumed that this power came only once and then no power will come afterwards. Like this, we always do this: that one guru has been accepted, then no other guru is possible.

Now, this gentleman who was in a lot of abdominal problem, after two or three days came again saying, “Mother, this has to be cured.” I said, “If you want this to be cured, then you have to accept Dattatreyaji, you have to accept Nanakji.” He said, “All right, whatever You say, I’ll accept.” Then I said, “All right, you pray to Nanakji for forgiveness, pray to Mohammed Sahib too for forgiveness.” And after that his cancer was cured.

You will be surprised to know that nowadays so many institutions, even political ones, where they preach that these religious gurus are bad, those religious gurus are bad. The reality is that all their followers and disciples they have of those religions, Muslims are as bad as Hindus, Hindus are as bad as Christians, and Christians are as bad as the followers of other religions. All their disciples did not recognise their Guru and did not follow their instructions at all. I can give you an example of this. Suppose Christians, if Jesus Christ said something special, like: Do not go following up any dead things, absolutely do not go behind any evil spirits, demons and such things. In any way possible you must stay away from evil spirits, demons and such things which are dead.In My opinion, only Nanak Sahib has spoken as openly as Jesus Christ about such matters. Even after speaking of such things openly, if you look into anyone who knows Christian religion, follows the religion; if you go and observe in any country – you will be surprised to know that in London, where I live, there are dead bodies buried under every church. Now if you place your feet there, your feet will stumble. Inside every church, inside every temple, they have placed buried bodies. They do the exact thing that was forbidden.

Now, look at the intellect of the Hindus. The intellect of Hindus is even greater. It was told to Hindus that all religions are one. Not only that; it was also told that within you, within everyone resides the same soul, the same reflection of God, which is the soul. Within everyone resides the same soul. Now no one surpasses the Hindus, who quarrel over caste and creed. When there is the same soul within everyone and it is also told that you have rebirths, then today you are a Hindu, tomorrow you may be a Muslim. Or if you are a Muslim, you may be a Christian tomorrow. Otherwise, tomorrow you may even be a cobbler, or you may belong to even lower class. People who claim themselves as great, considering themselves to be great Hindus, behave in a way that is worse than cobblers. Much more inferior to the lowest castes possible. You see those people sitting in temples taking money for performing rituals. If you observe them, you cannot believe if there is any connection between them and God or are they God’s enemies sitting here.

I went to Vrindavan, and in Vrindavan I was amazed to see that all the priests sitting there are demons. Not just demons but followers of Kansa. How they sit in front of Krishna and defame Krishna. Not only this; all those who come there are filled with evil spirits and they are destroying everyone. Krishna Himself has left those temples, those beautiful places. He doesn’t want to stay there, such filthy places. And you can see with your own eyes that they are looting you day and night, they are being unjust to you, telling you lies. They sell marijuana, and other things they sell there. They sell women, steal jewellery. They haven’t forsaken anything, yet we still consider them great gurus and fall at their feet. You have done all these deeds, but your children will not do these deeds. There is only onedire consequence one of all of this, and it will be that your children will say that there is no God, it’s all a lie and it’s all a scam. This consequence has happened in many countries.

For example, we have a disciple who lives in Algeria. He is a Muslim. When he came to London to meet Me, he started saying that “Mother, I do not have any faith in God at all. All the young people we have who are educated, who are doctors, architects, lawyers – none of them have faith in God. They say it’s all fanaticism; all lies; these are businesses to earn money, and all these organisations are completely wrong.” Then, as the great blessing of Sahaja Yoga remains, they got realisation at once. After getting realisation they settled into Sahaja Yoga. They gave realisation to five hundred boys and their faith in God became absolutely firm.

When you go from one extreme to another, from one extreme to another extreme, then right in between, this Guru tattwa grabs you. The meaning of a guru is someone who pulls you, attracts you, lures you in. But nowadays, the gurus who attract you use all kinds of awful things that it makes us wonder why you believe such gurus. At the very least, it should be understood that a guru must have some unique characteristic basically. The meaning of a guru is a person who is greater than you, a person who has reached a higher state than you. How can those who are at a lower state than you be your guru? The person who feeds off you, lives off your money, who is a parasite; will you go to someone’s place and stay for free, eat for free? How can a person who has been doing this all his life be your guru? He can be your dependent, your servant. How can he be your guru who has never done any work or business in his life except for taking money from you and living off it? You nurture such parasites from morning till evening, and you revere these gurus highly and you send things from all over the world for them and fulfil all their wishes. And it has reached the point where some gurus weigh themselves in gold, sometimes in diamonds, sometimes in some other material, and they keep all that material with them. They say that “whatever you give to me, you will get it back from God.”

Despite being so educated in our society, we still fall for such false claims. I am not surprised by you people; I am more surprised by those foreign people who consider themselves highly educated, highly developed, while doing such foolish things. I have seen them that if I tell you their stories, you will be shocked. You people do not go to such extremes in the matter of gurus. If the guru commands, they are ready to defend their faith – their condition is so bad. That’s why we wonder why such educated people do like this. What went wrong in Guru tattwa that they accept it in this way? And the straightforward, simple, very simple answer to this is that these people are not gurus, but they hypnotise. They have hypnosis power with which they hypnotise people. Hypnotising destroys a person’s intellect totally, and he drifts away in it completely. Many such gurus have propped up in this Kali Yuga. Some of them are of the highest degree of demons. They have been killed by the Goddess many times, but they have come back again. And these demonic people teach every demonic behaviour, every immorality to you, all kinds of awful things, and you people keep looking outside, thinking: “What a great sage for me, teaching me profound knowledge.”

The first quality for a guru is that he doesn’t care for your money and your wealth. He doesn’t care about anything you have. You cannot put him in bondage. He moves in his own rhythm. If he feels like it, he will talk to you; if not, then not. He is not someone who runs after you. Because I am your mother, I am trying to make you understand and I am telling you to know the guru within yourself, recognise your guru. But those whom I met are too much. They say that these fools – they reprimand Me: “Mother, why do You give them realisation? Let them suffer for a few days. Let them be. Their nature is different.” They sit with big sticks in their hands, or with tongs, or they sit with stones. If someone comes near them, they beat them with stones, saying, “Run away! There’s nothing for you here.”

But a mother’s perspective is different, the perspective of a guru is different. And when a mother has to become a guru, it is very distressing. This heart is filled with so much compassion and this heart remains so concerned that the Mother yearns to give the unconditional love that is flowing. But on the other hand, being a guru, a little discipline has to be enforced as well. You also need to be rebuked at times, saying, “Son, this is wrong.” It is painful to even say it, but it has to be done. This Guru principle is within you. Many times you have insulted it. It resides within you. Now, you will be surprised that how does this Guru principle manifest even in an ordinary person. For example, if you go to someone’s house to eat, provided you are a good person then if your host has a wicked or bad nature you cannot digest the food, you will vomit it out. When you come home you will say, “Oh my God, what was that? I started feeling nauseous there.” Sometimes it happens that you start feeling dizzy, wondering who this person is.

Similarly, we went somewhere to eat, and the people seemed very decent. His wife was there, three children were there; they appeared very well-behaved. But as soon as we went there I started feeling uneasy. I told the sahib, “Let’s go home, I can’t bear it anymore.” “How can it be? We are chief guest here.” I said, “Whatever it may be, I am feeling unwell. Let’s go home. I cannot bear it. There is a big terror going on here.” Then I returned home. After eight days, a little girl who used to study with our daughter came. I asked her – her name was the same as the name of this gentleman – I asked her, “Do you know them?” She said, “Yes, my father.” Then I asked her, “If he is your father, why are you in such a situation?” She started saying that, “He left my mother and took away all my mother’s property. And now he has kept this woman in the house, and there are three children who came to their house.” Tears were flowing from her eyes. She started saying that, “My mother was very simple in nature. She wept, so much screamed, but he left her and kept this woman instead.” Now see that the sorrow that was there in the house, the pain of that woman that was there in the house made the whole environment polluted. And whatever celebration was happening in it, I couldn’t be a part of it at all. My heart was so sad and tears were coming from My eyes constantly. I couldn’t understand what kind of pain there is in the environment, what kind of sad soul is pulling my soul from inside. And you must understand that this Guru tattwa is within you as well. When you go to someone’s house and see that you don’t like their food, all this Guru tattwa is within you. But you don’t keep it awakened.

Now, I will tell you how the Guru tattwa gets destroyed. How does a person continuously destroy their Guru tattwa? No one should feel bad, because I have said that I am a mother and whatever is the right thing I will tell you and I must tell you. There is nothing to feel bad about it. Everyone should understand that we continuously spoil our Guru tattwa and see how we spoil our Guru tattwa.

First, there is the consciousness within us in the Guru tattwa, which we call awareness, and our liver is the one that controls it, which we call the liver. As long as our liver is fine, our awareness, consciousness remains fine, and as soon as our liver becomes bad, our consciousness starts to fluctuate. You must have seen that someone who has bile, whenever he takes a fried item, he starts vomiting again. This liver, which nourishes your awareness inside the abdomen, is very important to keep it fine. Now what does the liver do? The liver, whatever poison we consume, or whatever accidentally enters inside, it separates it, analyses it, and returns all the poison in the blood through the bloodstream. This process is called sorting out of the poisons, and the liver does all this work. Now, its deterioration can be detected very late; this work keeps happening slowly. But there are some things due to which this liver – our liver is in the right side of our abdomen – deteriorates very quickly. The biggest thing that goes against the liver is alcohol. All the Gurus who have come into the world so far, whether he is Abraham, whether he is Moses, whether he is Lao Tse, or whether he is Socrates, all these are Guru tattwa. All the Guru tattwa have incarnated in the world, all these people are Gurus, and all Gurus have said that drinking alcohol goes against human dharma. Because there are ten commandants in our abdomen, and those ten commandants are attacked when the attack is on our consciousness. If a person’s consciousness decreases, when it goes against consciousness then it is wrong for us.

But a few days ago, we had a disciple who worked extensively on this in Sahaja Yoga, he has recently received a doctorate in London. He lives in Mauritius, his name is  Regis; he has proven how alcohol goes against us, what is the reason. It’s a subtle thing, understand this. Water is made up of a molecule of hydrogen and oxygen. In this molecule, there is one oxygen atom in the molecule and there are two hydrogen atoms. In this way, it is a molecule made up of three atoms. And when it stays in a neutral state, then oxygen stays in the middle and hydrogen stays on both sides. When this water of the blood, when it goes near our liver, then the water, the poison that is accumulated inside it, the liver absorbs it. If it stays in a neutral state, then it is very easy. But understand that if this is the liver, and if it comes into a neutral state in the liver, then it can take it, but if it happens in this way, then it cannot absorb anything. When you drink alcohol, due to the pressure of alcohol fermentation, oxygen comes down and hydrogen comes like this, and nothing can be received. It cannot accept anything, cannot absorb anything and because of this, the poison inside it remains as it is. But you must have noticed that if a person drinks alcohol, their temperature does not rise. If a person’s temperature does not rise from drinking alcohol, then the heat inside him only accumulates in the liver or some other organ. But the water, which is a very essential component in our blood, when this water changes like this, it cannot absorb it. And as many organs as there are in our body, first the liver gets damaged, and then gradually heat starts to build up in other organs too. And such a person begins to suffer from heat—it’s not just the liver; it happens in all organs to some extent. And this situation worsens and eventually leads to a serious condition like cancer.

Even in cancer, oxygen and hydrogen both change in this way, very much like this, so there is no reception, and that’s why you must have seen that cancer patients don’t develop a fever until their condition becomes very bad. Sores will appear on the mouth, black sores will form on the body, various things will happen. There will be a lot of heat in the body, feel very hot, but there won’t be a fever. And when he discovered this, think about it, England University awarded him a doctorate. Now, this topic is undisputed. Whether you feel bad or feel good, drinking alcohol not only diminishes your consciousness but also poison keeps accumulating inside you. And another thing is that you cannot remove the poison of arteries, and because of the kind of hydrogen curvature that occurs, which causes a hardening in arteries. And due to the hardening that occurs, the arteries of a person who drinks alcohol don’t remain flexible, so his blood doesn’t flow smoothly and he suffers from various diseases such as heart-related issues, other than heart such as gangrene, and so on, where blood gets clots in one place and then this rots and that rots. What’s the need to inflict such misery?

In reality, alcohol is fermented alcohol which is what we call: one is wine – which is a very good thing, without fermentation, only juice of grapes, that’s wine – but what we perceive as wine is alcoholic wine, which is actually alcohol. That alcohol was created by the Almighty for polishing something. If you have to polish anything, like you want to polish a diamond, you use gin, and if you have to polish something else, you use spirit, that’s the polish. When this polish goes into our arteries and accumulates, then hardening of arteries is inevitable. God didn’t create alcohol for drinking, but the human mind is like a monkey – he doesn’t understand what should be done and where. And he will certainly go and drink alcohol. He was never told to drink alcohol. I don’t know where he got it from, but he started drinking it and he got into the habit of drinking. This led to hardening of the arteries. He finds pleasure in drinking because the person’s consciousness completely disappears. Humans find it pleasing because their consciousness gets lost, then they can’t see themselves. They cannot understand themselves, escapes reality and prefer to live in falsehood. They feel the truth is terrifying, horrible. It’s not true. The truth is extremely beautiful, extremely beautiful, extremely enchanting and very peace-giving. And the support of all joy is truth.

But now you are in a state where neither have you found the truth nor are you in falsehood; you have entered into human existence in between. That’s why the question arises. That’s why these Gurus were born, to make you understand that you are born in this state of in-between. There’s no need to panic about this. Stay in balance, don’t go into extremes, don’t go out of balance. Make your life good. Stay humble in your married life, maintain balance at home, in your behaviour, in your society by giving consideration to all. Not this that one person becomes very rich or one becomes very strong or another one achieves lot of popularity. Because in nature, nothing is excessive; you will never hear that a person’s height has become sixty feet. Nowhere will you hear that a tree has grown to be two hundred feet tall. The height of a mango tree will be what is normal. Whatever is the flight of every aspect of human life, that too must be to a limit. The man who drives himself crazy by putting himself in competition ends up in the same state as what has happened to Western countries today. They have gone completely mad. When I see them, it astonishes Me that half of them are fit for the lunatic asylum. So when I read the statistics, half of them are actually schizophrenic and half of them, fifty percent of the people there are schizophrenic. What can you learn from them? Do you all now have to go to the lunatic asylum? This competitive life will always make people perpetually dissatisfied, and with this dissatisfaction, he is progressing towards complete destruction. With contentment and with temperance, humans should awaken within themselves.

This place of the Guru is a place of dharma. Dharma means that which we perceive and by which we can know ourselves as human being. I mentioned yesterday that carbon has its own dharma, gold has its own dharma, a lion has its own dharma, a scorpion has its own dharma, and similarly, humans also have ten dharmas. When a person deviates from these ten principles, when he falls, when he come into imbalance, then it’s uncertain what will happen next for him. Because after being human he will either become superhuman or demon. There doesn’t seem the likelihood of becoming animal – although some may be animals – but majority go towards demonic nature.

These ten principles should be followed. If someone says to abide by the Ten Commandments that are written in our Bible, what’s written in those Ten Commandments, that do not do this or do not do that. So psychologists have found an excuse for this: that it’s all conditioning. When you forcefully prohibit something, it is considered conditioning and there is no progress. But if you don’t impose culture, good culture on people, don’t make them cultured, then your right side will start functioning. You may control the left side – what we call the superego of the left side – you will manage it, you will save from conditioning. But the right side, which is the ego, you will become ego-oriented. You might even become like Hitler, still you won’t know that you have become Hitler. You’ll think: “Wow, wow, wow! What an amazing work I am doing. Everyone is garlanding me, doing my aarti, I have become such a big person.” Although you might be total donkey, not just donkey but a big demon, but you will imagine for yourself: “Wow, wow, wow, everyone else step aside, I am being praised. How people are understanding me.” Because the ego-oriented person is actually a great fool.

The description of such a person, if you read Valmiki’s Ramayana, or even Tulsidasji has beautifully portrayed it, that once Narada Muni became proud, then how he got fooled. But today, an ego-oriented person behaves so arrogantly, talks big, and then people listen to him in such a way that: “What a successful man.” But if you observe just a bit, you will notice his foolishness, how shallow he is, how much superficiality is there inside him. It’s so surprising. And that’s why an ego-oriented person impresses you more, he influences you more. If a person stands up and behaves dictatorially, saying, “I am so-and-so,” then everyone says, “Wow, what a nice man we found.” If you remove conditioning, the person becomes shameless—not only shameless, but he becomes completely misguided, what you call abandoned. Dharma is in between: neither total detachment is right, nor is religious fanaticism right. Neither is this too much blind following, nor is that we are everything and we run blindly towards it. God’s abode is in the middle. Dharma is established right in the middle. And to uphold dharma is the protection of Guru tattwa. 

What should we do to protect this Guru tattwa? Many people ask, “Mother, how can we protect our Guru tattwa?” The first thing is to understand who our guru is. Now there is a gentleman who is our guru. What does he do? Nothing much; he just gave us a name. Just gave a name – that’s enough? Why do we need a guru to give us a name? Even a donkey can do that. Why did he give you a name? Is there something wrong with your chakra? Is there something wrong with your region that he gave you the name of the king there? No, he gave us the name of Ram. He is chanting the name of Ram. Is Ram your servant, that you take the name of Ram whenever you feel like? If your guru is an authority he will never give you a name like this, the first thing. If any guru gives you a name, understand that it is the most wrong thing.

Now, let Me give you an example. Let’s say that you have any illness, then I would tell you, “All right, you have this illness, go and take this medicine.” Suppose you have a stomach problem and we say, “All right, take this medicine Entero-Vioform,” you understand. But if whoever I meet, I tell them, “Take Entero-Vioform,” then tell Me, what will say? When you are not a doctor, when you don’t even know the diagnosis, when you don’t even know the problem, what medicine are you giving? And will you keep taking the same medicine forever? Where is the problem, what is the problem? And when you are not a doctor, how are you giving prescriptions? A person who is not self-realised can’t be a guru, first and foremost.

We met a guru; he is a very interesting person, a very influential person, very interesting. We sent one gentleman to him: “Sir, please take care of his health.” One month later, he came completely exhausted, thin and frail. I asked, “What happened? What did the guru do?” He said, “Nothing. Every morning, he started telling me that I had to clean Lord Shiva’s temple. I had to climb one mile. Every day I would take a bucket of water from a mile away and wash the temple. Every day I would go back and forth, taking three or four buckets of water and washing it. Then he would say that it’s still not clean, wash it again. He made me clean the entire temple of Lord Shiva for the entire month.” I asked the guru, “Why did you make him do this?” He said, “Let the donkey do the donkey’s work, and this man is a donkey. You give him realisation. I won’t give him realisation; You can if You want to.”

The nature of these gurus becomes so harsh because they develop a dislike for humanity. They know that the common man is utterly shallow and they lack the compassion that a mother possesses. And since they have earned everything through hard work themselves, so they want everyone else to do the hard work. They should be corrected too. Just as clothes are beaten and cleaned by the washerman, they want to correct them too through harsh treatment. Mothers are different. They say, “Come on, whatever they are, they are children. Give it to them.” This is a big difference.

But let Me tell you about one of the guru maharaj. One guru, there is a place near Mumbai where My disciple lived, he went there and asked her, “When is your Mataji coming? I have been sitting for Her for 12 years.” She asked him, “Why are you sitting here for Her for 12 years?” He said, “My guruji said that She would come, and She only would correct your Agnya Chakra.” She couldn’t understand: “Mataji fixes Agnya Chakra in one minute, so why he sent you here to die for 12 years?” He said, “What to tell you, I am suffering with headache and now when Mataji will come, She will cure it.” When I came, they took Me to the hut where he lived. They made Me sit there. They said, “My guruji has also come to meet You. Amarnath.” I said, “Okay.” And, that guruji was sitting with his face turned away. When I went, poor thing touched My feet, and then sat down. I asked, “Why didn’t you correct his Agnya Chakra? It’s a one-minute job, and you are such accomplished person.” He started saying, “Let him die,” and then he gave him fifty curses, and in front of Me, he slapped him twice. I asked, “Why are you hitting him so hard?” He said, “He was smoking a cigarette before You came.” I said, “How did you know?” He said, “I saw him. Smoke was coming out of his mouth. He is such a wicked man, only You can correct his Agnya Chakra.” I said, “Look, whatever it is, he will quit smoking. Now, correct his Agnya Chakra.” He refused: “I am not going to do it.” After that, I corrected his Agnya Chakra. Then he started whispering in My ear, “Don’t say anything in front of him. He has kept me hanging in the well for three days. Three days, he would drown me and pull me out, asking if Agnya Chakra has been corrected or not.” So, I said, “Why are you sticking with such a person? Your guru is so evil.” He said, “Mother, what to do? I have become accustomed to wickedness. If anyone teaches me with love, I won’t be able to. He beat me so much and corrected me.” This view becomes the perspective of many gurus. The reason for this is that they think that until they don’t treat a person with severity, the person doesn’t understand properly.

But My belief is very strong, My hopes are very high. I think that a person is already in a very troubled state. And until they haven’t seen it, they are different, they are inconspicuous. And until they haven’t seen it, one should interact with them respectfully, inform them and guide them on that path. Many gurus who came into the world, those who adopted our path, like My path, like Gyaneshwarji was, like Tukaramji was here, like Namdev was, like that Nanakji was, and Kabir Dasji was. These people served the people of the world while living in this world, taught them dharma, and lot of injustice was done to all of them. They were so much troubled, beaten, not given food, kept hungry. When I listen about Gyaneshwarji, I feel: How people were capable of this? How did people manage to do so much injustice to him? They showed him so much cruelty. And today they are taking his palanquin around. Now Gyaneshwarji’s palanquin is being carried away. I said, “Has he ever sat in a palanquin? Has he ever even seen the face of a palanquin?” Fifty men carry his palanquin and everyone is serving him food. It should be said what kind of deceitfulness, what kind of falsehood and what kind of insult it is of Guru tattwa. You, who have never cared about whether he had eaten or not, are roaming around in a palanquin made for him and eating food on his name. Human beings are so cunning, so cunning, and he manages so much cunningness because God has given him complete freedom. Whether you are cunning or whether you are foolish, you do whatever you want, or whether you can achieve God. I am a mother, and a mother will always make this effort. A mother will always say, “Son, you must only find God.”

I accept that this is My gravity; many people bother and harass Me, no matter what happens. But perhaps with Me it is also true that I have a lot of patience. People say, “Mother, this is Your unconditional love,” whatever they say, but the reality is that I don’t feel even a little troubled by their troubles, nor do I suffer. My only concern is always how quickly more and more people can be uplifted, how many people can receive this gift. Today, Sahaja Yoga has come to that point where it can be called Maha Yoga. Until the train enters inside the station, we don’t consider that we have arrived by train – or as we can say, just like we don’t call a river a confluence until it merges into the ocean.

Similarly, until there is no union of your soul with Shiva, until Kundalini rises up and pierces through the Brahmarandhra, it should not be called yoga; then, yoga is merely a preparation for the union. There are many types of yoga, and all of them are preparations for this. And when the Kundalini rises from below to above, all these yogas take place within as the Kundalini reaches the Sahasrara and pierces through it. This is the greatest Maha Yoga, so the Sahaja Yoga that has been naturally going on since eternity – Sahaja, that is born with you, the one that has been with you for many years, which is now reaching its fulfillment – that Sahaja Yoga should be called Maha Yoga today. But initially, I had this thought that it is human nature; if I started with Maha Yoga right away, they will begin Mahakaal [war and destruction], and everyone would follow suit and get after Me. They would say, “How can You do Maha Yoga? Who are You to perform Maha Yoga?” Everyone would stand up with sticks in hand. That’s why I didn’t call it Maha Yoga. But the state of Sahaja Yoga has now reached the level of Maha Yoga, and we have reached the state of Maha Yoga. 

The time has come when all the fruits of the Guru tattwa that have been created until today are about to ripen, and as a result, you should now receive the thing that the Gurus had promised to give you for many years. You will get it, the time is approaching, it is going to happen. It used to happen, previously, gurus used to have one or two disciples. How many disciples did Gyaneshwarji have? One. Then how many disciples did his disciple have? One or two. Such a community neither made anyone their disciple nor talked about giving Self-Realisation. But until something is not communal and the ordinary don’t get it, its meaning gets lost. And the time has come for the community to get it, and it is your complete right to receive this. This is because all these things are contained within you, all these things are settled within you and you should receive them.

I said that I need seven days for each subject, but you gave Me one day to cover three subjects. So I have a big fear. How can we make such a big subject smaller? But I would like to say only this much: By simply offering namaskar to Guru tattwa, I reveal to you the Krishna Shakti.

The Krishna Shakti within us is the beginning of human beings. When humans lifted their neck upward, then the state of this chakra was formed within them. We call this the Vishuddhi Chakra. Inside it are sixteen petals, because in this area behind the neck, if you look behind the neck, then it is there. When humans lifted their neck and straightened it up, the Krishna Shakti was awakened. Now, one must understand that the power of Krishna is the perfection of evolution. Initially, we were amoebas, then from there, fish, tortoises, and other things; we reached Ram and beyond Ram to Krishna. Krishna is the complete power – Virat. When your Krishna Shakti is awakened, your connection is with the Virat, which is called in English as the macrocosm and microcosm, what is called as smashti [the whole] and vyakti [the individual]. In that samashti you merge, your vyakti [individuality] connects with it. This happens through the power of Krishna. Therefore, during My program I ask you if you can sit in front of Me with your hands in this way. Sitting with your hands in this manner will awaken your Krishna Shakti here, and your connection will be with the Virat. The power of the Virat – its name is Viratangana – this power is fully contained within us, and when you attain this power, when you attain the power of Krishna, then the power of being a witness develops within you. What this means is that you  see everything as drama. 

Reality is also a drama. It is a divine play. Krishna also considered it as divine play. When Rama performed His drama, it was portrayed in such a way that He was completely immersed in it. But Krishna’s is only a divine play, that is why He is called a complete avatar. When a person reaches completeness, he sees towards the whole world as though a drama is unfolding. People are jumping around like madmen, but he doesn’t get confused in that, he is not sad, he is not happy, but he is contained with joy, which is just one emotion. He remains contained in it. This is the power of Shri Krishna. With the power of Shri Krishna, we make two segments, one left and one right, and one centre. The power of the centre takes us to Virat.

Out of the power of left and right, the power of left is such that if a person feels a lot of guilt and thinks “I have made a big mistake. I have done something terribly wrong. I should not have done such a big wrong thing. I should not have done this.” Nowadays, this is a big fashion over there. When you reach a point of development, a lot of development happens, and then this thing settles within you. First you go to this extreme: “This is who I am, this is what I am and I must progress more”.This is  where our country is heading. And then you start descending – this has begun in Western countries – whoever you see cries, keeps crying from morning till evening. I said, “What happened?” They said, “I have committed many sins, Mother. I have done that.” I said, “Forget all that. Get your realisationt.” But they continuously keep crying over the same thing. It gets troublesome to hear their crying day and night. They cry so much that it’s surprising.

Many people think that our ancestors invaded a land of yoga like Hindustan. Nowadays, the youth there are very different. The English we saw before were different, and these are different. And when they start heading to the left side, there is a peculiarity in which a person starts consuming intoxicating substances. Because he feels that “I made this mistake, I made that mistake. I committed a sin, I have lied, I shouldn’t have said this.” And so he starts consuming intoxicants. In this, there is one thing that is very popular here, which is cigarettes, bidi [a type of cheap cigarette], then after that, tobacco. Tobacco consumption, tobacco consumption also greatly opposes this power. You will be surprised that the man who consumes tobacco has to quit it after coming into Sahaj Yoga. It drops off; it drops off on its own. 

There was a gentleman who didn’t quit, as he couldn’t apply his willpower, couldn’t quit. Sometimes he secretly kept consuming, hiding here and there. One day he came to Me and said, “Mother, when I sit for meditation, my mouth keeps twisting and turning in strange ways. I don’t understand what to do.” I said, “I know what’s going on. Quit tobacco today. Give Me your promise that you will quit tobacco.” Since that day his left side opened up and since then his Kundalini started rising properly.

Now, in the same way, you have seen that in the Western countries people were very ego-oriented. Previously, they indulged in a lot of egotistical behaviour, waged wars, killed people around the world and expanded their empires. They did everything. Now, when they reached a limit and then swung back from there like a pendulum, they reached another extreme, and there they realised, “Oh my God, what should we do now? How should we do it? We are so bad, we are so evil.” When they saw this, then they resolved to: “Let’s drink alcohol. If not alcohol, then let’s chew tobacco” – somehow flee from this. Now tobacco is not something that God made for drinking or eating. Human intellect so limited, what can I tell you. This thing is not made for drinking and eating. God made this tobacco – it’s an insecticide, made to kill insects. You people, don’t know from where, started lighting it up and started saying, “Let’s have tobacco.” But tobacco is very harmful, and with tobacco our Guru tattwa also deteriorates. It goes into the abdomen and damages the liver and other organs there. And Guru tattwa, which is filled in our ocean – this ocean is our guru – whenever we go against Guru tattwa, the ocean completely deteriorates and starts disintegrating.

When I went there to Guntur, there were people from Andhra. I told them, “You are sowing tobacco here. Please don’t grow tobacco here.” So they started saying, “We don’t give it to our countrymen. We send it all outside.” I said, “Your countrymen, here, the poor people of Andhra consume it a lot and practise black magic. And you people think by exporting it you’re doing a great religious act.” So they started saying, “No, no, Mother. Without this, we will die.” So, I said, “No one will die. You plant cotton here and everything will be fine with cotton.” Some of them were obedient and said, “Okay, Mother. We’ll plant cotton. We’ll start with cotton,” and then their business flourished. But I said it two or three times. It’s also recorded. But one day when they started discussing too much with Me, I said, “Beware. Don’t discuss too much now. If you do such things, this ocean will deteriorate for you.” You know what happened afterward, how severe a storm hit Andhra and how many people were devastated. And they didn’t even know where they went. You’ve always seen on that side that huge storms come into the ocean and people perish in it. But if you tell someone to stop growing tobacco, it’s a very inauspicious thing, no one is ready to listen. Now all that land has become saline; they can’t grow tobacco there anymore. Somehow tobacco cannot thrive anymore. So now they are crying over their fate. The entire area where tobacco is grown, and you always know cyclones hit there. They die there. The day people understand that by sowing tobacco and practising black magic the sea gets angry with us, that day they will understand how much blessings of God we have, how beautiful land we have; its use we should put in something else.

But humans don’t find satisfaction in small things. They want to take all the wealth of the world for themselves. But they don’t see that the one who has wealth, is he really sitting happily? Who is sitting in such great joy? So, this power of the left side, which we call the power of Vishnumaya. This is the power of the sister. The sister of Shri Krishna, Vishnumaya, you know, who was killed and who went to the sky and made the announcement that your killer is still alive. This is the power of Vishnumaya. And this is about the relationship of sisters. If your sister is sick, then this chakra will catch. If your sister is in trouble, then this chakra will catch. If your relationship with your sister is not right, meaning you consider someone as a sister but your intentions are not pure. Nowadays, people’s this chakra is very bad because there is no purity in them. Except for their wives, they should consider all other women as their sisters or mothers.

People laugh at what is written in the scriptures, saying, “How can this be, Mother? This cannot happen.” Because everyone has become dogs, right? Dogs don’t understand that there can be purity in this way too. Try it out yourself: just consider any other woman as your sister or mother besides your wife. See how much satisfaction you will feel inside, how many problems will be solved, how much society will develop. Look at the earlier society, how many people used to come and stay at home. There used to be no problems at all. Especially in the foreign countries. The situation in the foreign countries have become such that one of My disciples, who was only twenty-six years old, and his mother was, let’s say, around forty-two or forty-three, his friend came to stay with them in their house. So, his mother ran away with him. He was twenty-four years old, two years younger than her son. His mother ran away with him. I mean, there was no sense of proportion in anything. Just imagine, the son’s friend came home and ran away with mother.

Just before coming here we read an article that will surprise you. A seventeen-year-old boy has married his mother and now they are fighting in court, both the mother and son claiming that their marriage should be accepted. This is all extreme perversion of the left side. Even our filmmakers lack intelligence; they are committing so much sin that they will have to suffer its consequences. This is Satya Yuga. Everyone will have to suffer the consequences of their own sins. We have defiled our condition to such an extent, look at how are our faces. There is no glow on it, there is no innocence and nor there is any simplicity. In a way, it’s like always having roving eyes. Now, this disease of having roving eyes is also punished by the power of Shri Krishna. You see, people keep having roving eyes all the time. When you have roving eyes, evil spirits enter you. You don’t even realise that if evil spirits enter from the left side, your eyes start wandering, you don’t do anything except moving your eyes. Roving eyes like this doesn’t get you any joy. It’s a myth. You are wandering in this myth, eyes are moving from side to side. You’re watching this, you’re watching that, you’re watching that, and your Vishuddhi Chakra in the left side is being caught. By this catch in the left side, guilt develops within you all the time. You can never be happy.

That’s why in our era, when we were young, our parents used to say that we should always walk with our eyes on the ground. You may have heard that Lakshmanji only looked at the jewellery of the feet of Sitaji. He didn’t even look above them. Was he evil or bad person? There was only one reason that you should walk with your eyes down. The emperors always walked with their eyes down, and those looking like beggars, like ghosts, their eyes are always wandering around. A person who is in his own dignity, in his own prestige, what does it matter to him to look here and there? And you should know that as soon as you look at others, their negativity, their flaws, their conditioning seep into you. And this disease has increased so much among people that they are so filled with it that they don’t understand how to protect their eyes from it. It turns their eyes red, person’s eyes get weak, eyes start causing a lot of trouble. That’s why it is said that you should walk on the grass, walk on Mother Earth. She is your mother.

Only by knowing your mother will you understand your sister too. Until you know your mother, you cannot understand your sister. But the reality is that you should keep your eyes downcast and not look with an evil eye when walking on the path or looking at someone. This is a sin. And even the Gurus have said, “Thou shall not commit adultery.” Christ came and said even further: Thou shall not have adulterous eyes. He clearly stated that adulterous eyes are equally evil as adulterous life. He took you to such purity and had hopes. But today, where the world has reached, if we say this today, they feel bad. But you try and see. See the vitality and beauty that will come into your life and everyone else’s life. Roving eyes and degrading yourself in this manner, going to disco, prostitution and so on. Nowadays the songs that are there, the way women sit and sing and so on, all of it is so dishonourable. And the ways in which they make themselves so cheap, it’s incomprehensible. Especially, why do middle-class people need this? Your rich people are not going to be saved. They are definitely going to hell. They have all the means now. Someone who has excessive money thinks about what to do or not to do: in which hole to put this money, and with it, jump in it myself too. As soon as he gets money in hand, he first thinks: “Should I go to races, or do this, do that?”

Today I’m discussing sin and virtuous deeds because we are talking about the Gurus. The concept of sin and virtuous deeds comes to you on this Vishuddhi Chakra. What is sin and what are virtuous deeds? If you haven’t thought about sin and virtuous deeds at Vishuddhi Chakra, you are lost. Your Kundalini won’t awaken. Sin and virtuous deeds both exist in the world. But they think, “Mother, this person is so sinful yet look at how much progress he has made.” I said, “Go and see him in his home, look at his life. What progress he has made who has no joy on his face?” When people take his name, they say, “Oh my, whose name did you mention?” For a man whom no one ever speaks well of behind his back, such a person, such a characterless, such a fallen person, if you consider them as ideals, then you will be belonging there too.

When you get realisation in our Sahaja Yoga, then power will come from within you spontaneously. You will recognise your own dignity on your own because you are, you are very honourable. You don’t know how much effort God has put into creating chakras within you. Each thing is made with so much beauty, how it’s been crafted and how this Kundalini has been kept safe. You are insulting yourself. You are demeaning yourself. You should not feel it’s your mistake. Understand your maturity, understand your circumstances. You are the flowers of the whole world, and you have to turn into fruit. If you understand this, that you are worthy of God’s grace, God acknowledges you and is bowing to you, telling you to attain what is rightfully yours, which is your credit. Recognising merits also comes from human wisdom. As long as there is foolishness inside, one cannot achieve it.

This wisdom also comes from the awakening of the Vishuddhi Chakra. When a person awakens in their Vishuddhi Chakra, wisdom arises within him spontaneously. Balance comes within them. There is foolishness, there is bad sense, and there is wisdom. Intelligence does not make any difference because intelligence can be both foolish and wise. Based on intelligence, with rationality, a person steals. He says, “Why shouldn’t I steal? I don’t have this thing, he has it, so I stole. Why shouldn’t I steal it?” So, rationality comes into play. Rationality can rationalise everything. But wisdom will say, “No, others’ things belong to them and my things belong to me. The pleasure I am getting in my thing is not in that.” And also, nothing belongs to anyone. What belongs to whom? Have to leave everything behind. It’s just a mental thought to say this is mine and that is yours. It’s written in the registrar’s office that this is yours and this is mine. Everything has to be left behind while leaving. When leaving, a person leaves just like this, leaving everything behind. This is a common thing. Why make such a fuss about it?

Now, the chakra on our right side, which belong to the right-side Vishuddhi Chakra, is made from the power of Shri Krishna and Radha. The power of Shri Krishna and Radha, when a person stands against their power, when he stands against Shri Krishna then he becomes like Kansa, thinking, “I am the greatest king, I am the greatest leader, and I am everything.” When arrogance like Kansa grows within him—one who kills his own sister, kills his own brother-in-law, kills his sister’s children, “Somehow, I must rule over everyone”—he doesn’t see anything in the world. He is caught by the grip of the right-side Vishuddhi Chakra. But the grip of the right-side Vishuddhi Chakra first starts when you catch cold. Now everyone says that tulsi is very good for a cold. The reason is that tulsi’s power is here in the left side; it balances our right side. In other words, having a cold is not such a serious matter. But in Sahaja Yoga there is also a very good arrangement for a cold. For that, if you understand, people will tell you how your common cold, sinus problem and so on can be corrected. This can be corrected by people.

But the power in between, which is called the power of the Virata, this is the most important. Today, wherever people are searching for something, where humanity is engrossed in the search for the Divine and the search for truth, they are searching for their wholesomeness, searching for the Virata. They are searching that “if I am a part of that universe, then I should search for that of which I am a part.” This means that the thing we call collective consciousness has not yet awakened. We say, “You are brothers, you are sisters.” We give big lectures; UN has been established on this basis. Meaning, whatever is in the future, humans do the drama for that before, like a rehearsal. I find UN a type of rehearsal like that: you are also a brother, you are also a sister, all of you are siblings, everyone is collectively one. In reality, all this is still a lie for you.Not for us.

When you enter into Sahaja Yoga, your collective consciousness awakens. As soon as collective consciousness awakens, you begin to feel that “the other is within me, and I am within them.” You start seeing yourself because when the absolute point is reached, you can see the relative. Where are you in this absolute point and where are they? Now, to put it simply, what happens is that the chakras of your fingers become awakened. These one, two, three, four, five, six, seven – these seven chakras of the left sympathetic and seven chakras of the right sympathetic become awakened. When awakened, what do you start feeling? What is felt in this is, for example, if you are standing in front of someone, if you are standing with open hands in front them, in front of them, we can tell what illness they have. How do we understand this?

Imagine that if there is a pain or some warmth in this finger of My right hand, then I will know that there is a problem in their liver. Because this is the Nabhi Chakra of the right side, and the Nabhi Chakra is the place of the liver on the right side. After that, even small frequencies are caught by the person – so much so that in Sahaja Yoga as the person grows, he starts having the same feeling as one has in front of him. Meaning, when it feels like there is heaviness in the liver. And if you ask him if his liver is affected, then he says yes, the liver is affected. You rub your hands like this. Your liver will also be fine and his liver will also get better. If a man has a headache, when you go to him your head will also feel slightly heavy. You will say, “Are you having a headache?” And he will say, “Yes.” After that, you will press your head like this and make it better. You will see that his headache will also be relieved. Meaning, the collective consciousness that comes within you, the collective awareness that comes, this is subjectively coming. Meaning, it actually comes, meaning this is actualisation. It’s not just a conversation; it does happen. Your consciousness comes at this level that a new dimension comes within it in which you become collectively aware. You don’t have to say it. Even a small child who is a realised soul will say that, “Naani, look at him, there’s a catch in his heart.” If there’s a catch in this finger, then there is a catch in the heart. There is pressure in the heart.

This is physical, but emotional too you can tell. Many people appear intelligent from the outside but are crazy from the inside. If you go near them, they slap you twice. But if you are realised soul, you will know that they are crazy. You will understand, that is, where the Agnya Chakra is. That is, if someone catches some chakra on the left side, then some mental distortion has occurred in it. Some or the other emotional disturbance is there when left-sided ones are caught. If they come on the right side, they are physical and emotional. This is connected to your Vishuddhi chakra. Many people get realised but they cannot feel the vibrations inside them. The reason is the problem in the Vishuddhi Chakra. Because I have told that your cigarette smoking is harmful to the Vishuddhi Chakra. Even if you don’t smoke, in the city environment, just in case your father is one of the smokers, then this Vishuddhi Chakra gets damaged here. If the Vishuddhi Chakra gets damaged, then the two nerves that come out of the Vishuddhi Chakra which we have. When this consciousness comes in our central nervous system, even when we are awake, we cannot feel it because our sensitivity ends. Our sensitivity can increase from this chakra if this chakra is fully awakened. So there are also mantras for this chakra; one should understand this. By saying the mantra prescribed and explained for the awakening of this chakra, this chakra becomes awakened.

But the most miraculous mantra for Vishuddhi Chakra is if these two fingers of the Vishuddhi Chakra are put into the ear and the head is pushed back, and if you say “Allahu Akbar” three times, then your chakra will be cleansed. Because Akbar is the Virat. Mohammed Sahib talked about Virat, talked about Krishna. But who listens? Whatever He told you, such as do your hands like this and then read the namaz, all of it is the awakening of Kundalini. But if you go and tell this to Muslims, then they will chase me to kill Me. Mohammed Sahib was also an incarnation of Dattatreya, directly from Dattatreya, and I’d say that in the awakening of Kundalini, He and others did so much work as no one else has done. How should Satan be expelled? So many methods He explained, each one is more innovative than the other. And majority of them we still use in Sahaj Yoga also – majority of them. Most. Although we have people like Adi Shankaracharya who have written great things. Whatever their subtleties are, if you follow all those subtleties, you become completely stable in Sahaja Yoga.

We are very grateful for this country, these saints, sages, and these great incarnations. Such great incarnations have descended in this land of yoga. Especially in this land of virtuous deeds that we call Maharashtra. Many saints, sages have tended to this land with their blood. They have worked so hard so you get your realisation at the slightest of signals. Especially when I go to villages, I see that thousands and thousands of people flock in. Now look, you can also see how many people have come to our lecture. It starts from here.

People do not recognise the truth. There is no attraction for truth. People are going there. If someone says, “I will strip you naked and make you dance”. You will all leave for there. Paying money and dancing there, you will come back and say, “Wow! What fun it was.” Sahaja Yoga is not for such foolish people. Those who are serious, who have calibre; as they say in Marathi [in Marathi]: “This is not child’s play.” Until you don’t have complete faith, complete reverence towards yourself, this doesn’t work out. A person who has no faith in himself and has inferiority complex, one who sells himself for trivial things, for whom compromise with falsehood is very easy: Sahaja Yoga does not work for such individuals. Sahaja Yoga is for ordinary people. It is not necessary to be a great scholar or knowledgeable. It will work even if they are illiterate, but must have a strong heart, be like a king. Sahaja Yoga works on such a person effortlessly.

Now, if I start explaining Krishna Shakti, what seven days – to open all sixteen curtains and to explain, a lot is needed. Till today you don’t know what Kundalini is, you haven’t seen it, you don’t understand it. You can see it with your eyes, Its pulsation you can see. Its ascent you can see. The breaking open of the Brahmarandhra you can see. Now, these things are different; you haven’t known yet. These are strange things you haven’t known yet. But they are. Like there are many pictures here right now. You cannot see them. Put on the television, you can see. There are many songs playing here you cannot hear. But if you turn on the radio, you can hear. Similarly, this different, this power of the Divine is manifested everywhere. In atoms and particles, in everything, the power of the Divine is filled. Humans couldn’t understand this. If his Kundalini awakens, if his cord connects with the main source, then his conversation with the Divine will begin. Then on these very hands, which you think are ordinary, on these very hands you can know.

All of you put your hands like this and ask: “Is there God in the world?” You will see cool waves starting to flow within you. On this topic, I’ll say that a lot has been written in John’s Revelation of Bible, Such as what are the identifying characteristics of Adi Shakti. Because this work was possible only after Christ. It’s written how cool breeze should emanate from Her – this is how to recognise Her. You should also get to know this gradually. The other work that is done on this after Christ is that of Shankaracharya. Shankaracharya too – I am saying Adi Shankaracharya – he has also described it in the name of Saundarya Lahari. You look at this too and understand what it is.

There should be emotion of love for oneself. There should be respect. There should be extreme love. Because the Divine did not create you so that your life becomes meaningless—not in any way. If your life becomes meaningless then even God’s existence will have no meaning. Nor this creation will have any meaning. So, while maintaining respect for oneself and having a loving attitude for oneself, get fully engaged in this work with complete hope. All of you will definitely get this, for sure.

Tomorrow there is one more lecture in Hinduja College. I did this purposely because I couldn’t give lecture in this area before. I am hopeful that you could understand. If you have any questions you can ask Me, but ask good questions. Not foolish questions such as this person has said this and that person has said that. Whatever others have said, must have said, but it hasn’t benefited anyone yet. Neither anyone’s Kundalini has been awakened, nor anyone has benefited. So do not tell Me that “he said that and he said this.” If you have any sensible questions, then please do ask. But if you ask foolish questions, we will waste time foolishly.

You all have infinite blessings.
