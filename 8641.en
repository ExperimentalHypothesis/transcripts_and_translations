India Tour: Shakti Puja in Delhi - The Shakti of Satya Yuga, 1995-12-05
Hindi with oral English live translation from Sahaja Yogi.
Today, we are going to do the puja to Shakti in Satya Yuga. Because Satya Yuga has started in this environment, the influence of Shakti has also become more intense.
The first form of Shakti is that she is enlightened, ignited. She is full of intense light.
When the Shakti manifests herself in Satya Yuga all the manners of wrong people will be exposed, they'll come in front. Or wrongdoings of theirs will become in front [clearly seen]. All their acts that have been hidden to the rest of the world will be exposed.
All wrong actions of theirs – maybe illegal or maybe secret, or maybe terroristic or others all these forms of acts which are against Satya, which are against the truth. None of such activities, such an institution can be saved because there is a light of truth upon it. In this light of Satya, you will see its special form. Because I had only told you that Kritya Yuga has started, Satya Yuga will come and now the sun of Satya Yuga is on the horizon. Soon you'll get the proof of this, that whoever is on the path of untruth, who is indulging in untruth will be exposed. Even if he is a Sahaja Yogi, if he calls himself a Sahaja Yogi and indulges in wrong activities, he cannot save himself.
Till today, truth saved him, protected him and looked after him. But Satya truth does not have that power that it can protect people who are doing wrong things in the face of truth.
I told you the day before yesterday, that the biggest power of Shakti is love, is the power of love. The meaning of love is that without any expectation whatsoever, without any desire whatsoever, spread the kingdom of love. This work may be done by Shakti, but all this work of Shakti will be done through you, as the instruments. If Chaitanya could have done this work, then today there will not have been any Sahaja Yogis nor Sahaja Yoginis and there will not have been any need for Sahaja Yogis. Today there is such a need for Sahaja Yogis as you can see. Today, Sahaja Yogis are been prepared in collectivity. But the vehicle, channel for Chaitanya, it is you, people. But the vehicle, the carriage of this Chaitanya, that is you, people, you should not even glance or take people's claims towards wrong activities; because you are yourselves are full of Chaitanya, you have all kinds of shaktis. So many Shaktis are flowing through you and these Shaktis will make you completely capable and will you give all kinds of powers. And it also makes you healthy, you do not need to take recourse on anything else. As soon as you look towards something that's not supported, you will fall down.
Like, I've seen there are many highly placed people, who call themselves very high, very special. They will send a message that: "We wish to meet Mother." "I wish to have a special appointment with Her." There is nothing special about them, but: "I want to meet Mother." If you avoid trying to meet them, then the people say that: "Mother, they will trouble us a lot." Then, it's better to meet them. And people keep wishing all the time: "Mother, please meet them; please meet them." Then I say: "All right, OK, let's meet them." Then they will come, they'll get their Realization and they'll become all right but after that, they'll be not there. Because they don't understand the power of Shakti is intense, it's very capable. Once you've come to Sahaja Yoga, it's better that you establish yourself otherwise, you cannot be saved. Every time man thinks how can I profit from it, how can I benefit from it? When he comes to Sahaja Yoga he only thinks: "My daughter is not all right, my son is not all right, this is not all right, I have to spend so much on income taxes because of this problem, that problem."
All these problems, they all come upon you at the same time. At the very beginning, if there is no balance developed in man, then Sahaja Yoga becomes useless. When this balance comes into you, then you feel: "Now, this is too much what I have done, I don't want to do it any more." There's no need to do anything wrong that might harm society. To do wrong against anyone, after Sahaja Yoga, is of no use, no avail. People who have come to Sahaja Yoga and after having come to Sahaja Yoga, they try to make money, try to fight with people and apart from all of that, there is nothing better. Then it's self-destructive because Sahaja Yoga has this Shakti that just pushes such kind of people away.
And then if they get better and come back then, maybe there's some use. Like the sea has two kinds of powers: with one, the waves come towards the shore and with the other, they recede. In the same way, the light of Satya is "spandit" [is pulsating], "Spanda" [pulsation, throbbing] means at one moment it contracts and the next moment it expands. In the same heart, it expands fully. Adi Shankaracharya has called "vibrations" as "spanda"
"Spanda" means: at one time these vibrations lift you, the next moment they can even throw you down. I am not trying to frighten you. I just try to inform you that now we have to behave in such a manner so that we can progress in Sahaja Yoga.
The day before yesterday I had told you that in North India Sahaja Yoga is spreading very, very fast. At every place, people are coming to Sahaja Yoga in great numbers because there is a great profit from Sahaja Yoga. So, some get financial benefits, some are blessed with a son, everyone gets some kind of blessing or another, everyone is granted something. Some get a lot and others get a little bit less. The greatest benefit from Sahaja Yoga is this balance, this satisfaction, that: "I don't need anything else anymore." "I don't want anything anymore, I have got everything."
When you'll deserve this state then you will realize that now you have become a Sahaja Yogi. And then without any effort, whether you want it or you don't, Sahaja Yoga will take care of you, and will make you completely satisfied, contented. Your balance, your equilibrium will reach the seventh level and people will wonder: "What's happened with this man?" How has this man become completely desireless as if he has taken up some kind of sannyasa [ascetism]? He is the least bothered." Once I have been to America and there was a lady. I gave her Realization and she immediately started saying: Mother, it's incredible. Before Sahaja Yoga, I used to know everything in my shop, which that would be placed, how much it cost, I used to write down everything and I was worried about everything. But even then, I never had any profit, I only could lose money. Whether something would get sold or not, I was always worried all the time. After Sahaja Yoga, the effect was that I forgot how to count, how to keep records of everything, and the wonderful thing is that now, I am making a lot of money. I just can't remember anything, to whom I was selling my goods, who is buying them, who owes me money, I just don't have the information. And in this state of complete lack of information, everything works out. This means that Sahaja Yoga has taken her in his arms. So now she has given up all her worries about running a shop and everything and now she says that: "It's like someone is running my shop." 
When everything works out in such a way, one realizes that one has now reached the highest level: equilibrium and satisfaction. He doesn't have to think, he has achieved the state beyond thinking. The reason for this is that before Sahaja Yoga, we live a life based on thinking. You count everything, you weigh everything, you keep an eye on your watch all the time. And every time you feel that you miss out something.

Even if you keep your accounts scrupulously, still you end up with a kind of feeling that you miss out something. Because now you have taken up Sahaja Yoga as your work, then everything works "sahaj", spontaneously. In Sahaja Yoga, everything works "sahaj", spontaneously. 

You'll have the experience of this gradually. But in this Satya Yoga, the Shakti is working so that you can be completely dependent upon Sahaja Yoga. The fact that you become completely dependent on Sahaja Yoga then all your work, your entire life is completely filled with Chaitanya. And you don't have to take any kind of trouble, you don't have to worry about anything.

Once, there something which was stolen from my house, all my silk saris were stolen. With great difficulty, just one sari was left behind and I used to wear the same sari to all the parties that I went to. And my husband started thinking: "What is happening to her, she is only wearing the same sari everywhere?" I said that: "I have only one". And now all of you are giving me so many saris that I don't know what to do with them." Maybe, if there is another Draupadi Vastraharan [When Draupadi's chastity was saved by the infinite saris] then maybe these saris should be used because I don't know where to keep all these saris!"

But achieving this balance, this satisfaction is the greatest blessing that you can get with Sahaja Yoga.

Like for example, if I like something, then we keep hankering after it all the time: I need it, I want it, I must have it, and I keep trying my level best to get this. And we start to take loan and we are trying everything and when we get that, after that, we don't even look at it a second time and we start looking at something else. We are not happy with what we have got. We just don't look upon it twice.

These days there are so many beautiful flowers that are blossoming everywhere. On my way to the puja, I was just looking at all that. There are such wonderful flowers blossoming on the trees, I don't know if you people have noticed them or not. If your attention is on the Spirit, then the Spirit only shows you what brings the joy. Then in that, you really get your "svartha" because you realize what is good for your "svartha" that is yourself, you become selfish. Look! What a beautiful word they have chosen: our brothers and sisters have searched a lot and have chosen every word very carefully, "svarth" that you look for "svarth". "Svarth" means "what is good for the Self". Previously, people used to think that "svarth" means to try to make money, to try to gain this, gain that, but you never found happiness.

When you go crazy with all this seeking, this searching, then, you run towards your Self. So that is why they said that you look for "svarth", for "what is good for your Spirit, your Self". And you all the time look if your Self gets profits, your Spirit.

When it starts flowing in this stream of Satya, then you start realizing that this Satya, that looks after you, has millions of hands which look after you and you are in its protection. Then why to do anything wrong? Why do any such thing by which you get caught up and you get into troubles?

Even if you are caught up in something, then you get rid of this.

To give an example, I had bought five statues made of clay in Canada. I thought that we could make copies, we could make models like this in clay here in India and our customs did it at eighteen thousand rupees. I was quite amused: "how could these clay dolls ever cost eighteen thousand rupees? They may be worthy eighteen rupees."

I kept laughing and the news reaches the police and they also started laughing. And they said: "Look at this, can it ever be worthy eighteen thousands rupees?" And then, there were released from custom, because they were caught up doing a wrong thing. Sahaja Yoga looks after all this whatever is necessary, whatever needs to be done, all this work is done by Sahaja Yoga and it is done spontaneously. 

Then you must understand how to leave things to Sahaja Yoga. The greatest thing is to depend on, to leave everything onto Sahaja Yoga.

I see very often people are worried about useless things. And the meaning of all these worries is that you are not yet in Sahaja Yoga. So the meaning of the Shakti of Satya Yuga is that it is truth, light, and the third one is love. And the fourth is the peace of the mind. Now you must get this peace of mind (shanti). Whatever happens you just keep watching. If someone is worried about something, then he is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

You might have heard about Hazrat Nizamudin, Socrates, Muhammad sahib, that they were in such a position that they were given an ultimatum: tomorrow, if you don't bow your head before us, we will cut your head off. Then what happened was that the head of that king itself was cut off at night. Who did that? Not these people. It might have been done by their disciples, who cut off the head of the king? Someone must have done it.

As I told you, everything in Sahaja Yoga has two directions like the sea which gets floated at times and recedes at times. In the same way, even in Sahaja Yoga, you are looked after by two different Shaktis. With the first Shakti you raise, with the other Shakti you are thrown out. Once you are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga then we do not have any relationship with each other. You don't have any right over Me. If you wish to have any claim over Me, then first you must establish yourself in Sahaja Yoga.

The gold is heated in fire and is purified. In its purified state, it develops this characteristic that it can grips a jewel, a precious stone. In this state of gold, "kundan" [the kundan is a special technique of setting stones to gold, which avoids the use of claws and other frames used by the western jewelry. ], it is a soft state where you don't need anything else to set on with the gold, automatically the gold in this state is able to hold on to the precious stone.

There is nothing more difficult or harder than diamond. In the same way, you can also develop this pure state of gold, this state of "kundan". And in this state of "kundan" you will see that you are developing this state of equilibrium, balance and satisfaction. In this state, there are no thoughts, you go beyond thoughts. In Sahaja Yoga, you go beyond your intellect, beyond your thoughts, beyond your gunas, you become "gunatit". You reach the state where there are no thoughts whatsoever- no thoughts. You might look at anyone but you don't have any thought about that person, you just keep looking.

There is a habit of thinking which is not a reflexion. Whatever happens, anything, you think. You just lose this habit, whatever you see, you become free of thoughts. In fact, people just go crazy with this thinking.

One gentleman in Switzerland told Me: "Mother, please, relieve me from all the thoughts. Cut my neck off if you like but just set me free from all these thoughts." He was himself a doctor.

So these thoughts that are inside us are there maybe because of our pride, our ego or because our actions in our past lives or are from our culture. Then there are even other people who create this, cultivate this habit inside you. Maybe they come from the books that you read. Or you go to some guru, you meet this or that person, you talk to someone and you develop this habit. You have discussions and arguments with people. 

Now Swami Ramdas has said: "Mire vad sanvad aisa kara", which means "please, give me that advise that I lose this habit of arguments and discussions." "Please, tell me something that makes me lose this capacity to argument, debate and discuss." It means, "don't indulge in all this argumentation."

This point is also correct, because even if we come into Sahaja Yoga we keep thinking about everything.

But we don't know the special capacity of Sahaja Yoga: when we have surrrendered ourselves to Sahaja Yoga, when we completely surrendre to Sahaja Yoga, then even the thinking will be done by Sahaja Yoga. Even the solutions will be brought out by Sahaja Yoga, even the solutions to problems about which we are not aware but that are existing all around us.

Like, today, I said that we'll have the puja at three o'clock. I knew everyone is a householder, how could they reach there at three o'clock? "Probably, we'll be late, but there's not bother. We will come later when it will be time to come." There is not hurry to have. 

Very often, someone thinks that: "I have lost my way, I have lost my path." And one is quite worried: "How will I find my way? Who can I ask? How will I get back?" If you have lost your way, it is for Sahaja Yoga. Maybe you had to meet someone or maybe you had to travel that way or maybe something has to happen that is why you lost your way. Why to worry about it? After all, what are going to do? Are you going to go on the battlefield somewhere? And even if Sahaja Yogis are going to a battle, they will win définitely, they don't need to fight or anything.

[Applause]

In Satya Yuga, when one comes to the state of thoughtless awareness, one realizes that these thoughts have no power at all. Like, in many countries where people have exclusively depended on thinking, for example, America, this stupid man, Freud, who was a donkey, even worse than a donkey - I am sorry because I do not know any words worse for him- this greatest idiot, was made by them the equal of a god.

And yet, Americans want to be very happy all the time. All this joy is done in such a way that it leads towards destruction. For everything, they don't have any such thinh that doesn't have an element of destruction built into it.

Until they get destroyed, they will never realize that they have reached the limits of joy. Like, look at the kind of sports they do: they will go at the top of the mountains, they will ski and break their legs and knees and break their loins, etc. They will see people hurting themselves before them, but they will keep on going up there.

Wherever I lived in Europe, there was a church and, right next to it, a pub. Pub and church, both are beside. Those people who were entering the pub saw the others coming out from the pub, staggering out and falling down, but they still queued to enters so that they can be converted into the same state and can be stumbling out and falling down. This proves that all your thinking only destroys your wisdom.

Whatever a man did with his intellect and his pride or ego, it all went wrong. The result of all this is that we are suffering. But when you are following the direction of your heart, the result is different. Everything that you do in the light of the Spirit only works out very nicely, very well. It works out in the best possible way and great understanding. But this thinking has not got any understanding nor any such great technic because it hasn't got any awareness.

So today, when the time of Satya Yuga has arrived, when we are on the path of truth, there's no need to look back. Because you carry with you the greatest Shakti, the greatest light (Prakash) and you become light itself (Prakash). And that light has also such a quality that it has no shadow. This light is in front of you, on both sides and behind you. But this light or this illumination, you must get it shining completely with you. For that, I have shown to all of you a very simple way that is to meditate. But even that, you are unable to do it.

Especially, I have been told that women do not meditate. All their attention ison cooking, looking after the children, this, that. It's very surprising because women should be the first to meditate because they are the shaktis of the society (samaj). The first task of the women is to build up the society (samaj). It's not as they say in Russia that women are driving cars, trains or fly aeroplanes.

What great thing have they achieved? When men do not have work anymore, why do you want to drive taxis or trucks? Your task is to make a healthy society. You must build and consolidate the society and for that, you must have a very balanced outlook and a clear understanding. 

And to develop this unerstanding, the women need to be humble, to have humility. If a woman is not endowed with humility, she becomes a man.
