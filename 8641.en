India Tour: Shakti Puja in Delhi - The Shakti of Satya Yuga, 1995-12-05
Hindi with oral English live translation from Sahaja Yogi.

Today, we are going to do the puja to Shakti in Satya Yuga. Because Satya Yuga has started in this environment, the influence of Shakti has also become more intense.
The first form of Shakti is that she is enlightened, ignited. She is full of intense light.
When the Shakti manifests herself in Satya Yuga all the manners of wrong people will be exposed, they'll come in front. Or wrongdoings of theirs will become in front [clearly seen]. All their acts that have been hidden to the rest of the world will be exposed.
All wrong actions of theirs â€“ maybe illegal or maybe secret, or maybe terroristic or others all these forms of acts which are against Satya, which are against the truth. None of such activities, such an institution can be saved because there is a light of truth upon it. In this light of Satya, you will see its special form. Because I had only told you that Kritya Yuga has started, Satya Yuga will come and now the sun of Satya Yuga is on the horizon. Soon you'll get the proof of this, that whoever is on the path of untruth, who is indulging in untruth will be exposed. Even if he is a Sahaja Yogi, if he calls himself a Sahaja Yogi and indulges in wrong activities, he cannot save himself.
Till today, truth saved him, protected him and looked after him. But Satya truth does not have that power that it can protect people who are doing wrong things in the face of truth.
I told you the day before yesterday, that the biggest power of Shakti is love, is the power of love. The meaning of love is that without any expectation whatsoever, without any desire whatsoever, spread the kingdom of love. This work may be done by Shakti, but all this work of Shakti will be done through you, as the instruments. If Chaitanya could have done this work, then today there will not have been any Sahaja Yogis nor Sahaja Yoginis and there will not have been any need for Sahaja Yogis. Today there is such a need for Sahaja Yogis as you can see. Today, Sahaja Yogis are been prepared in collectivity. But the vehicle, channel for Chaitanya, it is you, people. But the vehicle, the carriage of this Chaitanya, that is you, people, you should not even glance or take people's claims towards wrong activities; because you are yourselves are full of Chaitanya, you have all kinds of shaktis. So many Shaktis are flowing through you and these Shaktis will make you completely capable and will you give all kinds of powers. And it also makes you healthy, you do not need to take recourse on anything else. As soon as you look towards something that's not supported, you will fall down.
Like, I've seen there are many highly placed people, who call themselves very high, very special. They will send a message that: "We wish to meet Mother." "I wish to have a special appointment with Her." There is nothing special about them, but: "I want to meet Mother." If you avoid trying to meet them, then the people say that: "Mother, they will trouble us a lot." Then, it's better to meet them. And people keep wishing all the time: "Mother, please meet them; please meet them." Then I say: "All right, OK, let's meet them." Then they will come, they'll get their Realization and they'll become all right but after that, they'll be not there. Because they don't understand the power of Shakti is intense, it's very capable. Once you've come to Sahaja Yoga, it's better that you establish yourself otherwise, you cannot be saved. Every time man thinks how can I profit from it, how can I benefit from it? When he comes to Sahaja Yoga he only thinks: "My daughter is not all right, my son is not all right, this is not all right, I have to spend so much on income taxes because of this problem, that problem."
All these problems, they all come upon you at the same time. At the very beginning, if there is no balance developed in man, then Sahaja Yoga becomes useless. When this balance comes into you, then you feel: "Now, this is too much what I have done, I don't want to do it any more." There's no need to do anything wrong that might harm society. To do wrong against anyone, after Sahaja Yoga, is of no use, no avail. People who have come to Sahaja Yoga and after having come to Sahaja Yoga, they try to make money, try to fight with people and apart from all of that, there is nothing better. Then it's self-destructive because Sahaja Yoga has this Shakti that just pushes such kind of people away.
And then if they get better and come back then, maybe there's some use. Like the sea has two kinds of powers: with one, the waves come towards the shore and with the other, they recede. In the same way, the light of Satya is "spandit" [is pulsating], "Spanda" [pulsation, throbbing] means at one moment it contracts and the next moment it expands. In the same heart, it expands fully. Adi Shankaracharya has called "vibrations" as "spanda"
"Spanda" means: at one time these vibrations lift you, the next moment they can even throw you down. I am not trying to frighten you. I just try to inform you that now we have to behave in such a manner so that we can progress in Sahaja Yoga.
The day before yesterday I had told you that in North India Sahaja Yoga is spreading very, very fast. At every place, people are coming to Sahaja Yoga in great numbers because there is a great profit from Sahaja Yoga. So, some get financial benefits, some are blessed with a son, everyone gets some kind of blessing or another, everyone is granted something. Some get a lot and others get a little bit less. The greatest benefit from Sahaja Yoga is this balance, this satisfaction, that: "I don't need anything else anymore." "I don't want anything anymore, I have got everything."
When you'll deserve this state then you will realize that now you have become a Sahaja Yogi. And then without any effort, whether you want it or you don't, Sahaja Yoga will take care of you, and will make you completely satisfied, contented. Your balance, your equilibrium will reach the seventh level and people will wonder: "What's happened with this man?" How has this man become completely desireless as if he has taken up some kind of sannyasa [ascetism]? He is the least bothered." Once I have been to America and there was a lady. I gave her Realization and she immediately started saying: Mother, it's incredible. Before Sahaja Yoga, I used to know everything in my shop, which that would be placed, how much it cost, I used to write down everything and I was worried about everything. But even then, I never had any profit, I only could lose money. Whether something would get sold or not, I was always worried all the time. After Sahaja Yoga, the effect was that I forgot how to count, how to keep records of everything, and the wonderful thing is that now, I am making a lot of money. I just can't remember anything, to whom I was selling my goods, who is buying them, who owes me money, I just don't have the information. And in this state of complete lack of information, everything works out. This means that Sahaja Yoga has taken her in his arms. So now she has given up all her worries about running a shop and everything and now she says that: "It's like someone is running my shop." 
When everything works out in such a way, one realizes that one has now reached the highest level: equilibrium and satisfaction. He doesn't have to think, he has achieved the state beyond thinking. The reason for this is that before Sahaja Yoga, we live a life based on thinking. You count everything, you weigh everything, you keep an eye on your watch all the time. And every time you feel that you miss out something.

Even if you keep your accounts scrupulously, still you end up with a kind of feeling that you miss out something. Because now you have taken up Sahaja Yoga as your work, then everything works "sahaj", spontaneously. In Sahaja Yoga, everything works "sahaj", spontaneously. 

You'll have the experience of this gradually. But in this Satya Yoga, the Shakti is working so that you can be completely dependent upon Sahaja Yoga. The fact that you become completely dependent on Sahaja Yoga then all your work, your entire life is completely filled with Chaitanya. And you don't have to take any kind of trouble, you don't have to worry about anything.

Once, there something which was stolen from my house, all my silk saris were stolen. With great difficulty, just one sari was left behind and I used to wear the same sari to all the parties that I went to. And my husband started thinking: "What is happening to her, she is only wearing the same sari everywhere?" I said that: "I have only one". And now all of you are giving me so many saris that I don't know what to do with them." Maybe, if there is another Draupadi Vastraharan [When Draupadi's chastity was saved by the infinite saris] then maybe these saris should be used because I don't know where to keep all these saris!"

But achieving this balance, this satisfaction is the greatest blessing that you can get with Sahaja Yoga.
