India Tour: Shakti Puja in Delhi - The Shakti of Satya Yuga, 1995-12-05

Hindi with oral English live translation from Sahaja Yogi.

Today, we are going to do the puja to Shakti in Satya Yuga. Because Satya Yuga has started in this environment, the influence of Shakti has also become more intense.

The first form of Shakti is that she is enlightened, ignited. She is full of intense light.

When the Shakti manifests herself in Satya Yuga all the manners of wrong people will be exposed, they'll come in front. Or wrongdoings of theirs will become in front [clearly seen]. All their acts that have been hidden to the rest of the world will be exposed.

All wrong actions of theirs – maybe illegal or maybe secret, or maybe terroristic or others all these forms of acts which are against Satya, which are against the truth. None of such activities, such an institution can be saved because there is a light of truth upon it. In this light of Satya, you will see its special form. Because I had only told you that Kritya Yuga has started, Satya Yuga will come and now the sun of Satya Yuga is on the horizon. Soon you'll get the proof of this, that whoever is on the path of untruth, who is indulging in untruth will be exposed. Even if he is a Sahaja Yogi, if he calls himself a Sahaja Yogi and indulges in wrong activities, he cannot save himself.

Till today, truth saved him, protected him and looked after him. But Satya truth does not have that power that it can protect people who are doing wrong things in the face of truth.

I told you the day before yesterday, that the biggest power of Shakti is love, is the power of love. The meaning of love is that without any expectation whatsoever, without any desire whatsoever, spread the kingdom of love. This work may be done by Shakti, but all this work of Shakti will be done through you, as the instruments. If Chaitanya could have done this work, then today there will not have been any Sahaja Yogis nor Sahaja Yoginis and there will not have been any need for Sahaja Yogis. Today there is such a need for Sahaja Yogis as you can see. Today, Sahaja Yogis are been prepared in collectivity. But the vehicle, channel for Chaitanya, it is you, people. But the vehicle, the carriage of this Chaitanya, that is you, people, you should not even glance or take people's claims towards wrong activities; because you are yourselves are full of Chaitanya, you have all kinds of shaktis. So many Shaktis are flowing through you and these Shaktis will make you completely capable and will you give all kinds of powers. And it also makes you healthy, you do not need to take recourse on anything else. As soon as you look towards something that's not supported, you will fall down.

Like, I've seen there are many highly placed people, who call themselves very high, very special. They will send a message that: "We wish to meet Mother." "I wish to have a special appointment with Her." There is nothing special about them, but: "I want to meet Mother." If you avoid trying to meet them, then the people say that: "Mother, they will trouble us a lot." Then, it's better to meet them. And people keep wishing all the time: "Mother, please meet them; please meet them." Then I say: "All right, OK, let's meet them." Then they will come, they'll get their Realization and they'll become all right but after that, they'll be not there. Because they don't understand the power of Shakti is intense, it's very capable. Once you've come to Sahaja Yoga, it's better that you establish yourself otherwise, you cannot be saved. Every time man thinks how can I profit from it, how can I benefit from it? When he comes to Sahaja Yoga he only thinks: "My daughter is not all right, my son is not all right, this is not all right, I have to spend so much on income taxes because of this problem, that problem."

All these problems, they all come upon you at the same time. At the very beginning, if there is no balance developed in man, then Sahaja Yoga becomes useless. When this balance comes into you, then you feel: "Now, this is too much what I have done, I don't want to do it any more." There's no need to do anything wrong that might harm society. To do wrong against anyone, after Sahaja Yoga, is of no use, no avail. People who have come to Sahaja Yoga and after having come to Sahaja Yoga, they try to make money, try to fight with people and apart from all of that, there is nothing better. Then it's self-destructive because Sahaja Yoga has this Shakti that just pushes such kind of people away.

And then if they get better and come back then, maybe there's some use. Like the sea has two kinds of powers: with one, the waves come towards the shore and with the other, they recede. In the same way, the light of Satya is "spandit" [is pulsating], "Spanda" [pulsation, throbbing] means at one moment it contracts and the next moment it expands. In the same heart, it expands fully. Adi Shankaracharya has called "vibrations" as "spanda"

"Spanda" means: at one time these vibrations lift you, the next moment they can even throw you down. I am not trying to frighten you. I just try to inform you that now we have to behave in such a manner so that we can progress in Sahaja Yoga.

The day before yesterday I had told you that in North India Sahaja Yoga is spreading very, very fast. At every place, people are coming to Sahaja Yoga in great numbers because there is a great profit from Sahaja Yoga. So, some get financial benefits, some are blessed with a son, everyone gets some kind of blessing or another, everyone is granted something. Some get a lot and others get a little bit less. The greatest benefit from Sahaja Yoga is this balance, this satisfaction, that: "I don't need anything else anymore." "I don't want anything anymore, I have got everything."

When you'll deserve this state then you will realize that now you have become a Sahaja Yogi. And then without any effort, whether you want it or you don't, Sahaja Yoga will take care of you, and will make you completely satisfied, contented. Your balance, your equilibrium will reach the seventh level and people will wonder: "What's happened with this man?" How has this man become completely desireless as if he has taken up some kind of sannyasa [ascetism]? He is the least bothered." Once I have been to America and there was a lady. I gave her Realization and she immediately started saying: Mother, it's incredible. Before Sahaja Yoga, I used to know everything in my shop, which that would be placed, how much it cost, I used to write down everything and I was worried about everything. But even then, I never had any profit, I only could lose money. Whether something would get sold or not, I was always worried all the time. After Sahaja Yoga, the effect was that I forgot how to count, how to keep records of everything, and the wonderful thing is that now, I am making a lot of money. I just can't remember anything, to whom I was selling my goods, who is buying them, who owes me money, I just don't have the information. And in this state of complete lack of information, everything works out. This means that Sahaja Yoga has taken her in his arms. So now she has given up all her worries about running a shop and everything and now she says that: "It's like someone is running my shop." 

When everything works out in such a way, one realizes that one has now reached the highest level: equilibrium and satisfaction. He doesn't have to think, he has achieved the state beyond thinking. The reason for this is that before Sahaja Yoga, we live a life based on thinking. You count everything, you weigh everything, you keep an eye on your watch all the time. And every time you feel that you miss out something.

Even if you keep your accounts scrupulously, still you end up with a kind of feeling that you miss out something. Because now you have taken up Sahaja Yoga as your work, then everything works "sahaj", spontaneously. In Sahaja Yoga, everything works "sahaj", spontaneously. 

You'll have the experience of this gradually. But in this Satya Yoga, the Shakti is working so that you can be completely dependent upon Sahaja Yoga. The fact that you become completely dependent on Sahaja Yoga then all your work, your entire life is completely filled with Chaitanya. And you don't have to take any kind of trouble, you don't have to worry about anything.

Once, there something which was stolen from my house, all my silk saris were stolen. With great difficulty, just one sari was left behind and I used to wear the same sari to all the parties that I went to. And my husband started thinking: "What is happening to her, she is only wearing the same sari everywhere?" I said that: "I have only one". And now all of you are giving me so many saris that I don't know what to do with them." Maybe, if there is another Draupadi Vastraharan [When Draupadi's chastity was saved by the infinite saris] then maybe these saris should be used because I don't know where to keep all these saris!"

But achieving this balance, this satisfaction is the greatest blessing that you can get with Sahaja Yoga.

Like for example, if I like something, then we keep hankering after it all the time: I need it, I want it, I must have it, and I keep trying my level best to get this. And we start to take loan and we are trying everything and when we get that, after that, we don't even look at it a second time and we start looking at something else. We are not happy with what we have got. We just don't look upon it twice.

These days there are so many beautiful flowers that are blossoming everywhere. On my way to the puja, I was just looking at all that. There are such wonderful flowers blossoming on the trees, I don't know if you people have noticed them or not. If your attention is on the Spirit, then the Spirit only shows you what brings the joy. Then in that, you really get your "svartha" because you realize what is good for your "svartha" that is yourself, you become selfish. Look! What a beautiful word they have chosen: our brothers and sisters have searched a lot and have chosen every word very carefully, "svarth" that you look for "svarth". "Svarth" means "what is good for the Self". Previously, people used to think that "svarth" means to try to make money, to try to gain this, gain that, but you never found happiness.

When you go crazy with all this seeking, this searching, then, you run towards your Self. So that is why they said that you look for "svarth", for "what is good for your Spirit, your Self". And you all the time look if your Self gets profits, your Spirit.

When it starts flowing in this stream of Satya, then you start realizing that this Satya, that looks after you, has millions of hands which look after you and you are in its protection. Then why to do anything wrong? Why do any such thing by which you get caught up and you get into troubles?

Even if you are caught up in something, then you get rid of this.

To give an example, I had bought five statues made of clay in Canada. I thought that we could make copies, we could make models like this in clay here in India and our customs did it at eighteen thousand rupees. I was quite amused: "how could these clay dolls ever cost eighteen thousand rupees? They may be worthy eighteen rupees."

I kept laughing and the news reaches the police and they also started laughing. And they said: "Look at this, can it ever be worthy eighteen thousands rupees?" And then, there were released from custom, because they were caught up doing a wrong thing. Sahaja Yoga looks after all this whatever is necessary, whatever needs to be done, all this work is done by Sahaja Yoga and it is done spontaneously. 

Then you must understand how to leave things to Sahaja Yoga. The greatest thing is to depend on, to leave everything onto Sahaja Yoga.

I see very often people are worried about useless things. And the meaning of all these worries is that you are not yet in Sahaja Yoga. So the meaning of the Shakti of Satya Yuga is that it is truth, light, and the third one is love. And the fourth is the peace of the mind. Now you must get this peace of mind (shanti). Whatever happens you just keep watching. If someone is worried about something, then he is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

You might have heard about Hazrat Nizamudin, Socrates, Muhammad sahib, that they were in such a position that they were given an ultimatum: tomorrow, if you don't bow your head before us, we will cut your head off. Then what happened was that the head of that king itself was cut off at night. Who did that? Not these people. It might have been done by their disciples, who cut off the head of the king? Someone must have done it.

As I told you, everything in Sahaja Yoga has two directions like the sea which gets floated at times and recedes at times. In the same way, even in Sahaja Yoga, you are looked after by two different Shaktis. With the first Shakti you raise, with the other Shakti you are thrown out. Once you are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga then we do not have any relationship with each other. You don't have any right over Me. If you wish to have any claim over Me, then first you must establish yourself in Sahaja Yoga.

The gold is heated in fire and is purified. In its purified state, it develops this characteristic that it can grips a jewel, a precious stone. In this state of gold, "kundan" [the kundan is a special technique of setting stones to gold, which avoids the use of claws and other frames used by the western jewelry. ], it is a soft state where you don't need anything else to set on with the gold, automatically the gold in this state is able to hold on to the precious stone.

There is nothing more difficult or harder than diamond. In the same way, you can also develop this pure state of gold, this state of "kundan". And in this state of "kundan" you will see that you are developing this state of equilibrium, balance and satisfaction. In this state, there are no thoughts, you go beyond thoughts. In Sahaja Yoga, you go beyond your intellect, beyond your thoughts, beyond your gunas, you become "gunatit". You reach the state where there are no thoughts whatsoever- no thoughts. You might look at anyone but you don't have any thought about that person, you just keep looking.

There is a habit of thinking which is not a reflexion. Whatever happens, anything, you think. You just lose this habit, whatever you see, you become free of thoughts. In fact, people just go crazy with this thinking.

One gentleman in Switzerland told Me: "Mother, please, relieve me from all the thoughts. Cut my neck off if you like but just set me free from all these thoughts." He was himself a doctor.

So these thoughts that are inside us are there maybe because of our pride, our ego or because our actions in our past lives or are from our culture. Then there are even other people who create this, cultivate this habit inside you. Maybe they come from the books that you read. Or you go to some guru, you meet this or that person, you talk to someone and you develop this habit. You have discussions and arguments with people. 

Now Samarth Ramdas Swami has said: "Mire vad sanvad aisa kara", which means "please, give me that advise that I lose this habit of arguments and discussions." "Please, tell me something that makes me lose this capacity to argument, debate and discuss." It means, "don't indulge in all this argumentation."

This point is also correct, because even if we come into Sahaja Yoga we keep thinking about everything.

But we don't know the special capacity of Sahaja Yoga: when we have surrrendered ourselves to Sahaja Yoga, when we completely surrendre to Sahaja Yoga, then even the thinking will be done by Sahaja Yoga. Even the solutions will be brought out by Sahaja Yoga, even the solutions to problems about which we are not aware but that are existing all around us.

Like, today, I said that we'll have the puja at three o'clock. I knew everyone is a householder, how could they reach there at three o'clock? "Probably, we'll be late, but there's not bother. We will come later when it will be time to come." There is not hurry to have. 

Very often, someone thinks that: "I have lost my way, I have lost my path." And one is quite worried: "How will I find my way? Who can I ask? How will I get back?" If you have lost your way, it is for Sahaja Yoga. Maybe you had to meet someone or maybe you had to travel that way or maybe something has to happen that is why you lost your way. Why to worry about it? After all, what are going to do? Are you going to go on the battlefield somewhere? And even if Sahaja Yogis are going to a battle, they will win définitely, they don't need to fight or anything.

[Applause]

In Satya Yuga, when one comes to the state of thoughtless awareness, one realizes that these thoughts have no power at all. Like, in many countries where people have exclusively depended on thinking, for example, America, this stupid man, Freud, who was a donkey, even worse than a donkey - I am sorry because I do not know any words worse for him- this greatest idiot, was made by them the equal of a god.

And yet, Americans want to be very happy all the time. All this joy is done in such a way that it leads towards destruction. For everything, they don't have any such thinh that doesn't have an element of destruction built into it.

Until they get destroyed, they will never realize that they have reached the limits of joy. Like, look at the kind of sports they do: they will go at the top of the mountains, they will ski and break their legs and knees and break their loins, etc. They will see people hurting themselves before them, but they will keep on going up there.

Wherever I lived in Europe, there was a church and, right next to it, a pub. Pub and church, both are beside. Those people who were entering the pub saw the others coming out from the pub, staggering out and falling down, but they still queued to enters so that they can be converted into the same state and can be stumbling out and falling down. This proves that all your thinking only destroys your wisdom.

Whatever a man did with his intellect and his pride or ego, it all went wrong. The result of all this is that we are suffering. But when you are following the direction of your heart, the result is different. Everything that you do in the light of the Spirit only works out very nicely, very well. It works out in the best possible way and great understanding. But this thinking has not got any understanding nor any such great technic because it hasn't got any awareness.

So today, when the time of Satya Yuga has arrived, when we are on the path of truth, there's no need to look back. Because you carry with you the greatest Shakti, the greatest light (Prakash) and you become light itself (Prakash). And that light has also such a quality that it has no shadow. This light is in front of you, on both sides and behind you. But this light or this illumination, you must get it shining completely with you. For that, I have shown to all of you a very simple way that is to meditate. But even that, you are unable to do it.

Especially, I have been told that women do not meditate. All their attention is on cooking, looking after the children, this, that. It's very surprising because women should be the first to meditate because they are the shaktis of society (samaj). The first task of the women is to build up society (samaj).

It's not as they say in Russia that women are driving cars, trains or fly aeroplanes,

What great thing have they achieved? When men do not have work anymore, why do you want to drive taxis or trucks? Your task is to make a healthy society. You must build and consolidate society and for that, you must have a very balanced outlook and a clear understanding.

And to develop this understanding, the women need to be humble, to have humility. If a woman is not endowed with humility, she becomes a man.

So if she is behaving deliberately as a man then she loses all her capacity to be a woman. If she thinks she has to compete with men, it's a big mistake. You yourself are so powerful, why compete with someone else? I keep repeating this again and again because, in every country where women have not realized their responsibility of looking after society, the country is declining. To look after their children, their home, is a work of great importance, of great responsibility. Of course, if necessary, they can work. If men want to learn how to cook, they can, there is no harm. But it's not their main role. In the same way, for a woman, it is important to illuminate their shakti. And it is only the women of this country who have avoided the destruction of society, believe Me.

But not by force, but by love (prem) a love that is completely devoid of any self-interest. And in this country, there has been such great women! Like Panna Dhai, for example, who, in order to save the prince, sacrificed her own child. This is part of history.

Like in some countries, when they learn that queen Padmini killed herself (jauhar) along with three thousand other women, they just don't believe Me they say: "How is it possible? How could she do that" I said: "Yes. This is what they used to do in our country."

It was only through their heroic deeds that the society is able to survive otherwise there is such darkness around us today that our country would have been destroyed long ago. We still exist only because of their noble deeds (punyas) and those same "punyas" today have taken a special form and appear before us in this Satya Yuga.

The result of that you saw it yesterday in the way the Romanians sang. They have never studied our music (sargam), they do not know our system of music. For example, there was a great master sitting there who said that for developing such a mastery it takes many years of hard work (tapasya)! How did the Romanians develop such a skill? Is not this a miracle (camatkaara)? In your life also, after Sahaja Yoga, there will be great things. Even then, you still depend on your own thoughts. So for that, Samarth Ramdas Swami has said: "uppe dharish twahete" [unsure]. "Whatever little intellect God has given you, [inaudible]." 

After dissolving in Sahaja, there is a special kind of joy that you get. So you must, therefore, reach that special state of joy but it does not mean that you go about like a mad man. In this state, you go beyond the act of doing and you gain the power to do it. And so to develop this shakti within you, then you must become one with Sahaja Yoga. So give up all these worldly things: some people want power, some people want a position, some want money. But the one who says: "I received everything, I do not want anything else." "All desires, all wants are over."

Then Param Chaitanya thinks: "Whatever you want, your desires, are mine." Then the desires of the Param Chaitanya become your desires. She will perform such wonderful things that you will be completely astonished. Things you did not even think about will happen. All the problems and difficulties of the world will be solved. And you will have nothing more to ask. Nothing remains if there is no want. Then you will become the giver, just the giver. What is there to ask? Those people who want something, have a lack of something. But those who are immersed in the ocean of satisfaction and peace, what would they want? You will look around all directions and will ask yourself, "What do I need this for?" But that does not mean that you become an ascetic, sanyasi and that you go to live in the jungle.

There is a very beautiful description that we have about Raja Janaka. They called him Videhi. He had to rule over the kingdom. He had to preside over dance performances and music and all other activities, but people called him a Videhi. One day, a disciple called Nachiketa asked his Guru: "When King Janaka comes in, why do you stand up?" The Guru replied: "Because king Janaka is higher than I am, you do not realize it". Nachiketa asked: "How?" So his guru said: "Because I had to leave all my worldly possessions and take up sanyasa, become an ascetic, and then only I achieved something. But king Janaka, without leaving all this, living a King's life he has achieved the Brahma." So, what is there to leave, to give up?

If you are attached to something, then you say: "I have given up this, that." But when you are not attached, what is there to give up? This attachment within us might be because of our thoughts or our upbringing, or our ego. If it has not yet disappeared, it means that you haven't established yourself deep into Sahaja Yoga.

Our attachment is developed only when we think something is very important. The Spirit (atma) has no attachment whatsoever. It is the giver, it spreads the light (prakash) in all directions. It is the giver of Shakti. Because of this Shakti people get completely surprised. They develop a complete oneness with this power. There is so much love that all quarrels disappear.

There is a Muslim gentleman in Algeria, his parents wanted to go to Hajj. So he said: "Go to London." They said: "Why London?" He said: "Because now the Hajj has moved to London." They said: "Is that so?" he said: "Yes, I went to London and that's where I go it. Then they came to London and came to Me. They said: "Our son told us that the Hajj has come now to London. So we came here." So this understanding came to one boy and his parents came to London to see Me because of him. So I asked them:"Why did you believe him?" They said: "He is a very entertaining boy. He has changed so much that we just can't believe it. How this boy has been so much transformed? There are so many people, thousand, who go for the Hajj but they is no change in them. Those who drink continue to drink, those who beat their wives continue, they remain the same. But this one boy, we have seen, was transformed tremendously." So now, the transformation of the Hajj might be in London. So that's why we came to London." This is the effect of truth (satya). 

Truth is so illuminated, so enlightened, so powerful that it is able to transform people. Some people are so impressed that they ask: "Who is this person?"

Sahaja Yoga has not been so widespread in Maharashtra. One gentleman came to Sahaja Yoga, today he is dead. He had to go to the collector's office for formalities. He was sitting very peacefully. There were some people who told him that they were in a hurry and wanted to pass before him, he said: "All right, you go." He was sitting very calmly. When he was called inside the collector's office, the people asked him: "How come you are not bothered, you were sitting so calmly?" He said: "Well, I wasn't in any hurry. So I sat quietly meditating."

In Maharashtra, a Guru is a very important person, so they asked him: "Who is your Guru?"

He said: "I will not tell you." They insisted but he did not tell them. While going home, four or five people were following him. They said to him: "Tell us who your Guru is, otherwise we will not leave you." So he gave them my name and they came to Sahaja Yoga. So, when I went to Rahuri, I saw that there were very many Sahaja Yogis as if a wildfire had passed by. "What brought so many people to Sahaja Yoga?" I asked. Because of love, because of oneness, because of the behavior of one man. He was not very handsome, but the light (teja) that emanated from him shone on those around him. So even to say: "What can we do? This country is all dark, everything is so corrupt and rotten from within." We cannot say that.

Even if only one man of quality comes, very solid, it will be a lot. I have said this before also: "The world bows but there should someone to make the world bow." If you are numerous to make the world bow to you, what else is needed?

But, first of all, it must be realized that you are settled in Satya Yuga and that Satya Yuga's Shakti is with you. Because of this, nothing is needed. It happens by itself. Nobody understands how things work out. Like yesterday, I announced ten minutes before that I was going to eat here, that I could not go home because there were Qawwals here. And I saw that in ten minutes the fire was on and the food was ready. They were surprised and they said: "Mother, said only five minutes ago that she would eat here, how is it that everything is ready in such a short time?" They are called "spontaneous caterers". They are really spontaneous.

[Applause]

How everything works out, you cannot explain it. The power of this Paramchaitanya is beyond description.

Someone asked Me: "Did Shri Ganesha drink the milk? Did Shri Shiva drink the milk?" I said that "Yes, maybe, they have." I am myself surprised to see how Paramchaitanya performs so many beautiful things even with Me. So Paramchaitanya can do anything. I did not know that Shri Ganesha was drinking so much milk. In any case, apart from showing our surprise, we can not do anything else. So many miracles happen and, in spite of that, if you only rely on yourself, OK, fine, let it happen.

Please believe that now you are in Satya Yuga and that this Shakti has enlightened you in a thousand ways, God only knows how many qualities are blossoming inside you and will come into action. You just have to say one thing as Shirdi Sainath said: "You must be patient (saburi)." This patience must not be mental and cannot be developed by saying: "All right, be patient, be patient", this is not the way. This patience (saburi) is also a state (sthiti). It is built in. It's a state. If you reach this state, then it is no need to say anything, to show anything, to count your troubles, everything works out inside us. Such things that you will never be able to imagine will happen.

Apart from this, it is very special that you are born in this country of India. It is a great privilege. It is because of your many good deeds (punyas) that you have done in your previous lives that you have been born in this land of Yoga (Yoga Bhoomi). And it is in this land that Satya Yuga will come first and the whole world will see what Satya Yuga is and how it functions.

[Applause]

But you are the lights, you are the flames, and it is you who must spread this light (prakash). You must believe it, understand it and adopt it. Such a great responsibility is upon you, you need to realize it. Many tell Me that it would have been better for them to be born in another country. For example, if they were born in America, they would have been much more esteemed. "No, I replied. Where I was born, it was a proper place to take my birth; it takes a lot of luck to be born in India."

Even here, Sahaja Yoga is spreading very fast. Why is Sahaja Yoga spreading so fast here? What is the main reason? The reason is that it is the land of Yoga (Yoga Bhoomi). Everywhere the Chaitanya is flowing in this country, far more than in the rest of the world. Beyond that, you have to understand that you are the vehicle of this Chaitanya. Your hands can bring it to other people.

Even now, I see sometimes that you are lacking something. Please set it right. Maybe there is a sort of problem with this body, this mind, this intellect, whatever it is set it right one way or another. You must say to yourself: "I have to free myself completely from these problems, clean myself." Only then, this country will improve, can be transformed. This country has a very bright future. With regard to those who say that this country is ruined, this country is going to dogs, I must tell them that in the most unleashed seas, only the strongest ships are seaworthy. So, you must become stronger.

So you have on one side this total darkness, on the other side, absolute light, your vibrant and pure existence which must be an example to others. To develop this greatness, you don't have to do anything. With devotion (bhakti), with total devotion, you have to meditate. It is very necessary that you meditate, with love (prem) and devotion (bhakti).

So with this bhakti you will develop an extraordinary personality and people will say, "Who is this person? Where is she from? Does she come from heaven?" So this is the capacity that you have, the potential. You must realize that inside you there is a glorious life that flourishes. Please, awaken it, let it grow.

Leave
aside all the goods of this world. "He has a car and I do not
have one. He has a very nice car and I do not have one ... "
What do you want to do with it? What does it bring you more?You
will be surprised: I do not know the number of my car, not even its
colour or its mark. I cannot even count money. Maybe if you give Me
ten rupees, I'll be able to count but give Me a hundred rupees, I
would not be able to count. I do not
know how to write a check. There are many things that I cannot do. I
cannot do any work and the work is done. The proof is that you are
all here.By developing this
understanding within you, then you will start to clean yourself from
within. So clean your chakras and meditate and with that only, the
whole world will be saved. I repeat it again and again, this
transformation will start from this country, India, So,
on this auspicious occasion, you must decide, in your heart, to stand
on the path of truth (satya). You will
see how things work out wonderfully. But if you are not even on the
path of truth, then how can the truth help you? If you walk in small
and narrow lanes or get trapped in a traffic jam (away from the path
of Truth), how will Truth help you?So
today you must make a promise to bring a glorious future to India
through your personality and your Sahaj powers. Integrate this
resolution into yourself and give up any negative behaviour.For
example, I brought back many things from the West to give gifts to
Sahaja Yogis. The customs officer did not see anything and thought
there was nothing. Because these things were covered by love, how
could they see them? How could they see it? Because
with great love, your brothers and sisters from abroad had brought
these gifts for you. How can we pay customs duties for this, do we
pay customs duties for love? 

They
did not come to do business. It's a remarkable thing. The Sahaja
Yogis had so much confidence! They said the customs did not even look
at them.A lady brought a silver
dish for puja. At that time, it was forbidden to export money. She
did not know because Indian laws are constantly changing. So she kept
the silver dish in her suitcase and brought it to puja. The customs
officer opened it and right on the top there was my photo, so he made
namaskar and he closed the suitcase. 

[Applause]

Thus,
with these exchanges between the countries, all our problems will be
solved. If a country does want to grant a visa, so we don( grant the
visa. If a country asks for a certain amount of money for a visa, we
do the same amount. One day, all that will be finished because we are
all one. The whole world is one. But
it's only through the mental work that these things happen because
the intellect side of us can only divide the world in different
countries. It is the same for religions.But
Sahaja Yoga is not the integration of everything, but
also brings them together with the power of love. So the shakti that
unites the essence of everything is
active today, so you must all use it because it can only be expressed
through your being.May God bless
you.
