India Tour: Shakti Puja in Delhi - The Shakti of Satya Yuga, 1995-12-05

Hindi with oral English live translation from Sahaja Yogi.

Today, we are going to do the puja to Shakti in Satya Yuga. Because Satya Yuga has started in this environment, the influence of Shakti has also become more intense.
The first form of Shakti is that she is enlightened, ignited. She is full of intense light.
When the Shakti manifests herself in Satya Yuga all the manners of wrong people will be exposed, they'll come in front. Or wrong doings of theirs will become in front [clearly seen]. All theirs acts that have been hidden to the rest of the world will be exposed.
All wrong actions of theirs â€“ maybe illegal or maybe secret or maybe terroristic or others all these forms of acts which are against Satya, which are against the truth. None of such activities, such institution can be saved because there is a light of truth upon it. In this light of Satya, you will see its special form. Because I had only told you that Kritya Yuga has started, Satya Yuga will come and now the sun of Satya Yuga is on the horizon. Because you'll get the proof of this, that whoever is on the path of untruth, who is indulging in untruth will be exposed. Even if he is a Sahaja Yogi, if he calls himself a Sahaja Yogi and indulges in wrong activities, he cannot save himself.
Till today, truth saved him, protected him and looked after him. But Satya truth does not have that power that it can protect people who are doing wrong things in the face of truth.
I told you the day before yesterday, that the biggest power of Shakti is love, is the power of love. The meaning of love is that without any expectation whatsoever, without any desire whatsoever, spread the kingdom of love. This work may be done by Shakti, but all this work of Shakti will be done through you, as the instruments. If Chaitanya could have done this work, then today there will not have been any Sahaja Yogis nor Sahaja Yoginis and there will not have been any need for Sahaja Yogis. Today there is such a need for Sahaja Yogis as you can see. Today, Sahaja Yogis are been prepared in collectivity. But the vehicle, channel for Chaitanya, it is you people. But the vehicle, the carriage of this Chaitanya, that is you people, you should not even glance or take people's claims towards wrong activities; because you are yourselves are full of Chaitanya, you have all kinds of shaktis. So many Shaktis are flowing through you and these Shaktis will make you completely capable and will you give all kinds of powers. And it also makes you healthy, you do not need to take recourse on anything else. As soon as you look towards something that's not supported, you will fall down.
Like, I've seen there are many highly placed people, who call themselves very high, very special. They will send a message that: "We wish to meet Mother." "I wish to have a special appointment with Her." There is nothing special about them, but: "I want to meet Mother." If you avoid trying to meet them, then the people say that: "Mother, they will trouble us a lot." Then, it's better to meet them. And people keep wishing all the time: "Mother, please meet them; please meet them." Then I say: "All right, OK, let's meet them." Then they will come, they'll get their Realization and they'll become all right but after that, they'll be not there. Because they don't understand the power of Shakti is intense, it's very capable. Once you've come to Sahaja Yoga, it's better that you establish yourself otherwise, you cannot be saved.
Every time man thinks how can I profit from it, how can I benefit from it? When he comes to Sahaja Yoga he only thinks: "My daughter is not all right, my son is not all right, this is not all right, I have to spend so much on income taxes because of this problem, that problem."
All these problems, they all come upon you at the same time. At the very beginning, if there is no balance developed in man, then all the Sahaja Yoga becomes useless. When this balance comes into you, then you feel: "Now, this is too much what I have, I don't want anything more." There's no need to do anything wrong that might harm society. To do wrong against anyone, after Sahaja Yoga, is of no use, no avail. People who have come to Sahaja Yoga and after having come to Sahaja Yoga, they try to make money, try to fight with people and apart from all of them, there is nothing better. Then it's ambitious because Sahaja Yoga has this Shakti that just pushes such kind of people away.
