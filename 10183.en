Spanish Radio Interview, 1982, June 1st Madrid

[pre-interview]

Shri Mataji: It’s the real baptism. It’s the real baptism. You actually feel the bones becoming soft, on your head, and the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost starts coming out of your head. It’s alright?

Interviewer: Yes. We will ask you how many persons practice Sahaja Yoga?

Shri Mataji: How many? In the world, lots of them. But Spain is the last place, I should say. Even we have Portugal, many people practising. In London, lots of them. America, everywhere. In India, in the villages – thousands. People practice it en-masse because you just become that, it's becoming.

Shri Mataji: We should tell them also about the fake gurus and the cure because we cure nice people who are affected by them.

[interview starts at min 3:28]

Interviewer: [Presents Shri Mataji in Spanish]. Good afternoon.

Shri Mataji: Good afternoon.

Interviewer: What is Sahaja Yoga?

Shri Mataji: “Saha” means “with”, “ja” is “born with you”, it is born with you. And “yoga” means union with the Divine. And this right - to be one with the Divine, is born with you. So you have a right to be born again which is promised in the scriptures. So you have to be born again. And this system is built within you but it happens that you become that. As you have become a human being from an animal state, you become divine by this happening. A new awareness comes into you, a new dynamic awareness starts emitting through you because you become the Spirit. And that is what is told in all the scripture: that you have to be born again, that you have to be Spirit. It is said that your hands will speak. And then your hands start speaking because it starts flowing through your hands, the energy that is of your Spirit. And you can make out what’s wrong with another person, what’s wrong with you. And you can correct it also with the hands. And you feel very peaceful and happy and this is what every human being has to achieve. Because the human being is a transition, he’s not yet achieved his absolute, he’s not achieved his meaning.

Interviewer: What is the difference between Sahaja Yoga and the other yogas?

Shri Mataji: This is not a cult. This is something that is within you which works out by itself because this one has to happen. But other cults are just money-making propositions that you achieve nothing. Here you achieve your own powers, you become the Guru.

Interviewer: How many people you have, all over the world?

Shri Mataji: In other countries, there are in thousands but in Spain, it has to be established.

Interviewer: Why do you think Sahaja Yoga is not taking in Spain? Because it is unknown?

Shri Mataji: People are naive and seekers, they are good seekers, very deep seekers. But they are naive and they have been entangled by clever gurus. And those gurus who have failed outside now, who have been found out, are settled down now in Spain.

Interviewer: So is it a minority that comes to Sahaja Yoga, all over the world?

Shri Mataji: Not minority.

Interviewer: No, I mean here in Spain.

Shri Mataji: Yes, here in Spain. Another thing I discovered that some Spanish people have started it, the thing here, like some “Malaga”, “Balava”, all sorts of things they have also started. You see, the Spanish also are trying to make money out of it. It’s most surprising. [Spanish translator refers to the cult as “empresa de acólitos” o “San Bala”.

Interviewer: In which country you have most Sahaja yogis?

Shri Mataji: Of course in the Indian villages, thousands are there, thousands we’ve got.

Interviewer: Apart from India, which countries?

Shri Mataji: Apart from India, which other? England and Switzerland, Portugal. But the maximum now is in England and France, I should say. I’ll tell one more thing: that people take time to take to reality. Artificiality is very easily accepted because you don’t have to become. Here you have to become. If you pay the money you become a cult member. Just pay the money, you become a member. You can’t do that in Sahaja Yoga. Real flowers are difficult to create and plastic flowers are very easy.

Interviewer: You said before that Sahaja Yoga cures illnesses. How is that possible?

Shri Mataji: It cures because it is the vital force that starts flowing through you, the vitality that is lost, through which you work out everything in life. It’s again pushed back into you through the All-pervading Divine Power that starts flowing through you, which does all the living works, like even transforming of the flowers and all that.

Interviewer: How many cases have you cured?

Shri Mataji: I would say thousands.

Interviewer: And what diseases, spiritual of physical ones?

Shri Mataji: Cancer is caused by a little bit of a mental problem, always. And it’s absolutely curable through Sahaja Yoga.

Interviewer: Do you think that Sahaja Yoga can be completely absorbed in the western society which is so culturally diverse from the oriental one?

Shri Mataji: Love has nothing to do with culture. It is a living technique, you see. If you sow the seed here in Spain or in England it sprouts in the same way. It’s beyond all this.

Interviewer: In conclusion, how long Mrs Shri Mataji will be in Spain and what is her post in Sahaja Yoga?

Shri Mataji: There is no post in love, I am a mother. What is the post of a mother in your family, you tell me.

Interviewer: But they are different, no?

Shri Mataji: This is not like a regular, official thing. It is God’s Kingdom.

Interviewer: Thank you very much for being here.

Shri Mataji: Thank you. Thank you.

[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Will she come?]
