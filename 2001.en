How to talk to new comers. Bangkok (Thailand), 16 March 1995.

We had lots of people, I should say for the program. By the time I started the program there were many people coming. Now the problem faces you is this that when I go away, there are very few sahaja yogis left here, and they have to look after the newcomers. And the problem is like this that you have to deal with them very carefully, because, you know, they are now yet not such sahaja yogis as you are and they don’t understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

To get realization is very easy, but to become a sahaja yogi is a difficult thing. It’s a very deep growth that you require to become a good sahaja yogi. As it is they are coming just now from that human awareness, which you have to make a divine awareness. So it’s a very difficult task I must tell you, so with all compassion and love you must deal with them, should never talk sharply.

Sometimes sahaja yogis will say, “Oh, your - this chakra is catching,” or they say, “You have got this bhoot in you,” and all sorts of things. Then they get, you know, quite shocked. You shouldn’t say all these things. Then if they tell you, “He has been to this guru, that guru,” in the beginning you should not condemn also any guru or anything. So, all right we have many like this, but they are all right now. But you can take also upon yourself: “I was also like you, you see.” Somebody says, “I doubt.” “All right, I was like you, now I’m all right,” so they don’t feel so hurt. It’s the most important thing is public relations.

Now I’m surprised at myself, because I’m a foreigner everywhere and so many come. And when it comes to the program and all that follow-up, they disappear. So can’t understand what’s the matter with them. Why should they disappear? The reason may be - I don’t know whatever the reason is - that they are not such serious seekers, maybe they are guru-shopping, maybe you see, they are going to many places. You just can’t say why it is so.

And this will be a very big challenge to all of you, because you are few and they are maybe more. So they will see from your own character, from your own style how you behave. So always support each other. See, many people start supporting other people instead of supporting sahaja yogi and sometimes they even discuss and argue. So between sahaja yogi there should be no discussions, no argument, nothing. You understand? Anything that you have to do it, you should do it separately, not before the newcomers, because that creates the worst impression and they think that there’s something wrong with these people: “Why were they arguing among themselves?”

So you have to just support only sahaja yogis and nobody else. Others are others, we are all one. Once they come to Sahaja Yoga they will also realize. But this sometimes also upsets them very much that we are all the time quarrelling, fighting, saying things - as if we are not one.

Now only thing you have to tell them that, “You see, now if you have a guru, what has he given you?” is the point. “Whatever you have given is all right, but what have you given him is not the thing. What he has given you? Has he given you the knowledge? Has he given you Realization?” You have to tell them. “Did you get your peace? What did you get?” This is what you have to tell and what you can get in Sahaja Yoga.

Best thing would be to play My video tape and let them see for themselves. You can play it for half, whatever way you like. And then see if they have any questions, you should very silently answer them. Then you put them into meditation. Don’t talk to them too much in the beginning, because that will spoil you and spoil them. All right you sit down for meditation, let us see. Then you can just go and see on their heads if there is cool breeze coming, hot breeze coming. And also tell him how to meditate. Then they will ask you how to meditate. Then you have tell them this is how you have to meditate.

Now you should see whether they are right-sided or left-sided. And accordingly you have to tell them what they have to do. But in a very gentle and a sweet manner assuring that you will be all right. There’s no problem. Now if they have anything to report, they are sick or something, you should say that, “We’ll tell you how to do it, but we’ll also write to Mother,” and you can write to Me through your leader.

Now we should know that we are believers in the power of love. And so we have to be very gentle with people. And not to be angry, upsetting them or saying things which can upset them. Like a businessman when he has to get people, he’s selling something, he is extremely nice and gentle.

So now we should say we are selling Sahaja Yoga for nothing. Now you have to give them that security that peace that love, among yourselves you should really behave in such a manner that they should really feel that you are people, who are deep and you are enlightened. If one person is talking, another should not jump in. Let one person talk and another should look after another person. All this is going to help you very much to make the Sahaja Yoga grow here.

Now you know I’ve been to Kuala Lumpur at least five, six times, and this time it was about more than four thousand five hundred people, four thousand five, apart from sahaja yogi. Sahaja yogi also increased a lot. So to begin with we had about three, four people like that, doesn’t matter. I’ve been here only twice, so of course it is going to take time. I’ll come again and again. And I’m sure within three, four visits you’ll have large and large numbers of sahaja yogi. Firstly I was surprised in the market all the ladies were bowing to Me, and they were saying, “Give us blessings”. All the men were bowing to Me. Anybody who sees Me bows to Me. It’s very surprising. That means there is already the awakening has come. The people are realizing there’s somebody, who is something, who can do good to them.

One other very encouraging thing is that we got a princess, who became a nun and who is looking after the misery of women in this country. She is very influential. She got her realization and she appreciated what I told her. Then another gentleman, who is very influential, he and his wife both got realization, and I cured his wife. So they have a great influence in the society, so they can definitely help you very much in getting people of elite societies, educated people, all kinds of people. So that your [INAUDIBLE: I think] will be strengthened. Also there are lots of Sikhs and Punjabis here. It will take some time. Like I used to go to Delhi; I went there for about at least ten years, and what we find - nothing happened, very poor. But now there are sixteen thousand sahaja yogi, who are practicing Sahaja Yoga, and it spread to other places: Noida, then Ghaziabad, then in Haryana, Faridabad and Yamuna Nagar and all that, then in Dehradun, also in Haridwar.

I was surprised, I got into the train at Dehradun, and the train went to Haridwar, and I heard people singing My jay jayakar and also the music. I said, “Who are these people?” And there were at least three thousand people at the platform. Then I came onto the door, I stood there. They behaved so well; nobody tried to touch My feet or anything. Such love, such understanding I cannot forget. Unexpectedly suddenly you find people are singing your praise there. Very, very sweet [INAUDIBLE] and it was so sudden. Last year it happened, this year again. I couldn’t go to Haridwar, I could only go to Dehradun. I think in Dehradun we are twenty thousand people.

You see the Western people are very conditioned people. It takes time, but once they get it, they get into it. They understand. I don’t know how I could achieve all these things with the Western people and also Indian people, but the greatest surprise is Russia. Where in one place we have twenty one thousand sahaja yogi, who are practicing Sahaja Yoga. See, for example in France there are no practicing Christians, the practicing are Muslim, there in majority. Was it surprising? And that’s why they are after the Muslims to get them out and they are also after us. But by getting after us, they are not going to establish themselves, this they should know. They cannot establish themselves.

Things will improve now in France. We’ll have to do lots of things about it, how they are racist and how they have been misbehaving. And the Catholic Church has taken over there, I mean I can’t see any sense in. The Pope is another horrible fellow. And then they are doing all kinds of nonsensical things everywhere. In Canada they are spoiling children, molestation, horrible things they are doing. In France itself, but in Italy is the worst. They found one man dressed up like a lady, walking on the street, he was a priest. And then Austria, Austria is the limit. They got hold of one priest with some lady, and this priest confessed there are many priests who are like us. And they go in the daytime, they have their friends, means these ladies, married ladies, and some of them have children from them. And they go on a bicycle in the daytime so that there is no noise. But when Vatican was asked, “Why don’t you allow them to marry?” So they said that, “You see, because we have no money to pay for the widows.” Can you imagine? This is the situation of this Catholic Church, and they think no end of themselves. So we are going to bring all these things out, now there’s one fellow writing a book about it. One should not worry; everything will work out very well now in every country, wherever there is Sahaja Yoga.

I never expected Americans to come to Sahaja Yoga. They are in now in thousands also. It’s very surprising how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga. So we have to be very careful, we are the messengers of God. We have to be careful not to use any bad word, angry word, but very gentle and sweet words. And to each other between husband and wife there should be full understanding. And the children should be treated very kindly and sweetly.

So best of luck and I want to thank all the sahaja yogi, who came from France. Shows our collectivity is so strong and how they got the ticket also, just see the Divine how it helps you. I can’t believe this ticket of yours, can’t believe it. So everything works out and works out beautifully.

So I hope to see you again on My birthday. They are already five hundred, who are coming from abroad and some of them are already there. I wish I could have brought some presents for you, but you know this traveling business and then customs, very difficult.

So now I have to get ready to go and I am very thankful to you to do this job. I’m asking him to come here permanently. Prakash should be here permanently. That would be such a help to you. Thank you.

May God bless you.
