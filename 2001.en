b"\nAdvises on how to talk to new comers. Bangkok (Thailand), 16 March 1995.\n\nShri Mataji: Can I have my spectacles?\nLaurence: Yes\nShri Mataji: Please be seated, please.\nCome here in the front. Why don't you come here?\nSahaja Yogi: [about the mike]\nShri Mataji: [Unclear]\nI'll have some tea?\nLaurence: Yes\nShri Mataji: [Unclear]\n\nNow, we had lots of people, I should say for the program. By the time I started the program, there were many people. \n\nNow the problem faces you is this, that when I go away, there are very few Sahaja Yogis left here, and they have to look after the newcomers. And the problem is like this, that you have to deal with them very carefully. Because, you know, they are now yet not such Sahaja Yogis as you are and they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what is Sahaja Yoga.\n\nTo get Realization is very easy, but to become a Sahaja Yogi is a difficult thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very deep growth that you require to become a good Sahaja Yogi. As it is, they are coming just now from that human awareness, which you have to make a divine awareness. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a very difficult task I must tell you. So with all compassion and love, you must deal with them. You should never talk sharply.\nSometimes Sahaja Yogis will say: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, your \xe2\x80\x93 this chakra is catching,\xe2\x80\x9d or they'll say: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have got this bhoot in you,\xe2\x80\x9d and all sorts of things. Then they get, you know, quite shocked. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say all these things.\nThen, if they tell you: \xe2\x80\x9cWe do this guru, that guru,\xe2\x80\x9d in the beginning you should not condemn also any guru or anything. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's all right, we have many like this, but they are all right now.\xe2\x80\x9d Or you can take also upon yourself: \xe2\x80\x9cI was also like you, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSomebody says: \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I was like you, now I\xe2\x80\x99m all right.\xe2\x80\x9d So, they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel so hurt. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the most important thing is public relations.\nNow I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at Myself because I\xe2\x80\x99m a foreigner everywhere and they, so many, come. And when it comes to the program and all that follow-up, they disappear. So I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with them. Why should they disappear?\nThe reason may be \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whatever the reason is \xe2\x80\x93 that they are not such serious seekers, maybe they are guru-shopping, maybe, you see, they are going to many places. You just can\xe2\x80\x99t say why it is so, you see. And why they are - [Shri Mataji clears her throat]\nCan you bring my purse? I've got something for the troat.\n\nAnd this will be a very big challenge to all of you because you are few and they are maybe more. So they will see from your own character, from your own style, how you behave. So, always support each other. See, many people start supporting other people instead of supporting Sahaja Yogis. And sometimes they even discuss and argue. So between Sahaja Yogis, there should be no discussions, no argument, nothing. You understand? Anything that you have to do it, you should do it separately, not before the newcomers, because that creates the worst impression and they think that there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong with these people: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy were they arguing among themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo you have to just support only Sahaja Yogis and nobody else. Others are others, we are all one. Once, they come to Sahaja Yoga they will also realize. But this sometimes also upsets them very much that we are all the time quarreling, fighting, saying things \xe2\x80\x93 as if we are not one.\n\nNow, only thing you have to tell them that: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, now if you have a guru, what has he given you?\xe2\x80\x9d is the point. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you have given is all right, but what have you given him is not the thing. What he has given you? Has he given you the knowledge? Has he given you Realization?\xe2\x80\x9d You have to tell: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you- [Shri Mataji clears her throat] Did you get your peace? What did you get?\xe2\x80\x9d This is what you have to tell and what you can get in Sahaja Yoga.\n\nBest thing would be to play My videotape and let them see for themselves. You can play it for half, whatever way you like. And then, see if they have any questions, you should very silently answer them. Then you put them into meditation. Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to them too much in the beginning, because that will spoil you and spoil them. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right you sit down for meditation, let us see.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nThen you can just go and see on their heads if there is cool breeze coming, hot breeze coming. And also tell him how to meditate.\n[Shri Mataji asks if they also give them Her photo] \n\nThen they will ask you how to meditate. Then you have to tell them: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is how you have to meditate.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNow, you should see whether they are right-sided or left-sided. And accordingly, you have to tell them what they have to do. But in a very gentle and a sweet manner, assuring that: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be all right. There\xe2\x80\x99s no problem.\xe2\x80\x9d Now if they have any good things to report, they are sick or something, you should say that: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how to do it, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll also write to Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d and you can write to Me through your leader.\n\n[Shri Mataji drinks a glass of water]\nTalking, talking, [Shri Mataji laughs] \n\nNow we should know that we are believers in the power of love. And so we have to be very gentle with people. And not to be angry, upsetting them or saying things which can upset them. Like a businessman when he has to get people, he\xe2\x80\x99s selling something, he is extremely nice and gentle.\nSo now we should say: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are selling Sahaja Yoga for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nNow, you have to give them that security, that peace, that love. Among yourselves, you should really behave in such a manner that they should really feel that you are people, who are deep and you are enlightened people. If one person is talking, another should not jump in. Let one person talk and another should look after another person. All this is going to help you very much to make the Sahaja Yoga grow here.\nNow you know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Kuala Lumpur at least five, six times. And this time it was about more than four thousand five hundred people, four thousand five, apart from Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogis also increased a lot. So, to begin with, we had about three, four people like that, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here only twice. So, of course, it is going to take time. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come again and again. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure within three, four visits, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have large and large numbers of Sahaja Yogis. \n\nFirstly, I was surprised in the market all the ladies were bowing to Me, and they were saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGive us blessings\xe2\x80\x9d. All the men were bowing to Me. Anybody who sees Me bows to Me. It\xe2\x80\x99s very surprising. That means there is already the awakening has come. The people are realizing there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody, who is something, who can do good to them.\n\nAnother very encouraging thing is that we got a princess, who became a nun and who is looking after the misery of women in this country. She is very influential. She got her Realization and she appreciated what I told her. Then, another gentleman, who is very influential, he and his wife both got Realization, and I cured his wife. So they have a great influence on the society, so they can definitely help you very much in getting people of elite societies, educated people, all kinds of people. So that you are, I think, will be strengthened. \n\nAlso there are lots of Sikhs and Punjabis here. It will take some time. Like I used to go to Delhi; I went there for about at least ten years, and what we find \xe2\x80\x93 nothing happened, very poor. But now there are sixteen thousand Sahaja Yogis, who are practicing Sahaja Yoga, and it spread to other places: Noida, then Ghaziabad, then in Haryana, Faridabad and Yamuna Nagar and all that, then in Dehradun, also in Haridwar.\n\nI was surprised, I got onto the train at Dehradun, and the train went to Haridwar, and I heard people singing Jay Jayakar and also the music. I said: \xe2\x80\x9cWho are these people?\xe2\x80\x9d And there were at least three thousand people at the platforms. Then I came onto the door, I stood there. They behaved so well; nobody tried to touch My feet or anything. Such love, such understanding, I cannot forget. Unexpectedly suddenly you find people are singing your praise. It's very, very sweet of them to have come and it was so sudden. Last year it happened, this year again. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Haridwar, I could only go to Dehradun. I think in Dehradun we are twenty thousand people.\n\nYou see, the Western people are very conditioned people. It takes time, but once they get it, they get into it. They understand. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I could achieve all these things with the Western people and also Indian people, but the greatest surprise is Russia. Where in one place we have twenty-one thousand Sahaja Yogis who are practicing Sahaja Yoga. \n\nYou see, for example in France there are no practicing Christians, the practicing are Muslim there, in majority. Was it surprising? And that\xe2\x80\x99s why they are after the Muslims to get them out and they are also after us. But by getting after us, they are not going to establish themselves, this they should know. They cannot establish themselves.\n\nThings will improve now in France. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do lots of things about it, how they are racist and how they have been misbehaving. And the Catholic Church has taken over them. I mean I can\xe2\x80\x99t see any sense in it. The Pope is another horrible fellow. And then, they are doing all kinds of nonsensical things everywhere. In Canada they are spoiling children, molesting, horrible things they are doing in France itself. \n\nBut in Italy is the worst. They found one man dressed up like a lady, walking on the street, he was a priest. And then Austria, Austria is the limit. They got hold of one priest with some lady, and this priest confessed there are many priests who are like us. And they go in the daytime, they have their friends, means these ladies, married ladies, and some of them have children from them. And they go on a bicycle in the daytime so that there is no noise. But when Vatican was asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you allow them to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d So they said that: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, because we have no money to pay for the widows.\xe2\x80\x9d Can you imagine? This is the situation of this Catholic Church, and they think no end of themselves. \n\nSo we are going to bring all these things out, now there\xe2\x80\x99s one fellow writing a book about it. One should not worry; everything will work out very well now in every country, wherever there is Sahaja Yoga.\n\nI never expected Americans to come to Sahaja Yoga. They are in now in thousands also, yes. It\xe2\x80\x99s very surprising how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga. So we have to be very careful, we are the messengers of God. We have to be careful not to use any bad word, angry word, but very gentle and sweet words. And to each other between husband and wife, there should be full understanding. And the children should be treated very kindly and sweetly.\n\nSo best of luck and I want to thank all the Sahaja Yogis, who came from France. Shows our collectivity is so strong and how they got the ticket also, just see the Divine how it helps you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe this ticket of yours is [Shri Mataji laughs]  I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. So everything works out and works out beautifully.\n\nSo I hope to see you again on My birthday. They are already five hundred who are coming from abroad and some of them are already there. It's too much [Shri Mataji laughs]\nI wish I could have brought some presents for you, but you know this traveling business and then customs, it's very difficult.\n\nSo now I have to get ready to go and I am very thankful to you to do this job. I\xe2\x80\x99m asking him to come here permanently. Prakash should be here permanently. I said it would be such a help to you.\n\n[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]\n[20:23. End of tape] \n\nPrakash: About that thing, Shri Mataji, we would like to give You a present. Shri Mataji: What? Prakash: A Banyan tree. Shri Mataji: This is the present? Beautiful! Janine: The symbol of the Banyan tree, they put this behind the [Unclear]. We thought that it is the symbol of Kundalini, Agnya chakra and Sahastrara. Prakash: We thought that this could be ego and superego Shri Mataji and then the Sahastrara with all the coils at Sahastrara. And here, a little Kundalini. Janine: And here are the coils. Prakash: As You are the highest person in Sahastrara in the world, we thought it would be with You much better than with anybody else. Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. May God bless you. So now will you bring it with you somewhere? Prakash: Yes. [Laughter] Yes, I could bring it to Cabella. Shri Mataji: It's your headache. \n\nJanine: It can be in two parts.\nShri Mataji: It's both the sides?\nPrakash: No, Shri Mataji, just this side Shri Mataji.\nShri Mataji: Let them see. \n\n[Inaudible]What's the matter with your camera?\nSahaja Yogi: The film is finished.\n[Shri Mataji laughs]\n\nShri Mataji: All right. I'll take your leave. Thank you very much.\nMay God bless you.\nMay God bless you.\nMay God bless you.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, can I give you one little thing from Napoli Committee.\nShri Mataji: What is that?\nSahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]\nShri Mataji: Who's done this? Beautiful. It's from where this?\nSahaja Yogi: From Napoli.\nPrakash: From Napoli.\nShri Mataji: From Napoli?\n[Laughter]\nSahaja Yogi: Here we are! Many Yogis [inaudible]\n\nShri Mataji: There is a doctor in Napoli, isn't it? Sahaja Yogi: There is more than one, there is Spiro [inaudible] some other doctors [inaudible] Shri Mataji: They will be all there for some staff, sometime. I'm going to meet them in Italy at Sahastrar puja. You are going now to India and then to Napoli? Sahaja Yogi: No, I live  [inaudible] Prakash: Shri Mataji, he did'nt take tickets for India. Shri Mataji: He's got the ticket? Prakash: No Shri Mataji. He just came to Bangkok, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: And then? Prakash: [To the Italian Yogi] And then? Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible] Prakash: After he goes back to Italy Shri Mataji. \n\nShri Mataji: May God bless you.\nGive it to him and put this [inaudible]\nIf you want it back this one or not?\n\n[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]\n[End of video]\n"
