Birthday Felicitation, New Delhi

[Hindi Translation Missing]

[English Transcription]

I told in the Hindi language that love you can see one persons love manifested in so many eyes here and when I saw the enthusiasm so my hearts got filled with love greater love. So one can see how powerful is this love. All kinds of bad feelings, negative thinking and also self-destructive elements can be corrected and controlled very simply in Sahaja yoga. If you with a sincere heart meditate morning and evening twice. That time we should not see our watches. Of course, but enjoy your meditation that will give you such a strength to love others, to forgive others. Instead of you feeling bad for small- small things, you feeling irritated because you think your self-respect is challenged or else sometimes we become aggressive towards some people, very aggressive for no fault of theirs.

The best thing is to see the vibrations of another person. If the vibrations are bad no use fighting, it will create more confusions. A person who has very bad vibrations, you cannot fight with that person, you cannot control that person or a person who has too much of self-importance who should not try to pacify you or sort of try to negotiate with him or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity. By doing that you are spoiling him more. So the world's best thing is to show your love in a very sweet and different manner.

I will give you an example which I have given many a time that I went to see this Gagan Maharaj, who was living on a very high mountain. There was no way of going by car or anything and so I had to walk. Everybody said mother why should you go there after all. I said you see the vibrations, good vibrations coming. Alright, that's why I am going but he had told many people about me and he has said that Adi Shakti is born in Bombay why do you come to me so they told us so I said I must see this man and that's how I went to his place to meet him. Now he is supposed to control the rain. He could control the rain. So he was sitting there on the stone and he was moving his head with the great agitation when I reached there and it was raining so heavily that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched so I went inside足足足足 the cave where he is to live and he came back with great anger towards the rain. So he said mother why did you not allow me to control the rain. I said I did not do that. No you did because I can always control the rain and you are coming all the way with my invitation and this rain should not have misbehaved. No, no he did not misbehave. So what happened he was in a quiet temper you know. I said you settle down I will tell what has happened .See you had bought a sari for me and you are a sanyasi and I won't take a sari from sanyasi. So the rain has made it convenient. Now it's all drenched and so I have to take your sari. He may get (UNCLEAR) he felt terrible love for me and started crying and he fell at my feet then he said mother now I know what is the greatness of love. How it takes you away from mundane things and dry behaviour and takes you to a place where you can enjoy the showers of love. This is one of the stories I am telling you but the main thing behind the whole episode is this that you should try your love, tricks of pure love and it works and you must learn gradually you learn how to try. You should not give up.

Some people are very difficult. I agree very, very difficult but at least try with people who are not that difficult and you will be amazed who will have good company and lots of friends and friendship. As we have here now in Sahaja yoga.

First time when I came to Delhi. I got such a (fright ) of this place because they were very few Sahaj yogis and they brought and I don't know why they wanted to do my puja. Might be Bombay people must have told something. They brought kumkum and everything in plastic utility bottles. I really shrunk with their ignorance and what to do. What will happen but today see the same Delhi became is so great and so beautiful and so enthusiastic. I saw them with their flags and I did it(.........) procession of flags will be here. Though we had once or twice I think in Cabela but how they were enjoying each other. It's really remarkable. If you can enjoy the love you won't enjoy anything else but love for other people and not for yourself.

On the contrary, you will see that your body, your mind, your thoughts, everything is directed towards creating love for others, not for yourself. The whole attitude changes. Like in the darkness you can't see anything but even if there is small light it spreads all over. Nobody tells that light that you have to spread light all over but, it does in the same way you are enlightened people. (you all are enlightened people OR you are enlightened with light) . Light of this love spreads automatically, spontaneously Sahaj.

I was also very much enamoured the way our Yuva shakti was dancing and enjoying. I think it's a very big blessing because these days our young children or young people are getting astray there are not so badly (off) as in other countries, but quite a big trend is going on to spoil them and to make them very westernised, spoiled personality but now I saw so many dancing together forgetting their caste, creed everything and enjoying each other company. This is something has to happen in this country and every country. That we should all feel ones and enjoy the oneness with each other. If we do not enjoy we are like the drop outside the ocean which can be dried anytime but if you are part and parcel of that ocean. Then what happens is that every movement of the ocean you carry with you and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely because you don't have a separate identity. All those which makes separate identity in our society or in our culture or in our behaviour or in personal lives all should be completely curbed off and this will settle many problems from family life, to national life to personal life to international life. So we should curb down all such feelings of separateness that we should have a separate house, separate state, separate nation. Gradually all nations will become one. I am sure of that because great times are coming and so many people at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja yoga. Once they take to Sahaja yoga than things will be much different.

Today it's not with them, Sahaja yoga will not with them. They have no knowledge of our grate movement of love. So they want to have separate of everything. They don't know tomorrow they will be scotched away with heat around or maybe with the rains, we will be washed away or maybe that mother earth might absorb them. So we all should be together. Whatever may be the differences and in different families, we are born, after all, all cannot be born in one family, but now you belong to Sahaja yoga family . This Sahaja yoga family is one. It does not believe a separate existence or separate speciality. We are all one with each other and we don't care what sort of differences are outside. I was really very much touched because now the new year is coming with a new challenge for all of us which we have to accept that kali yuga is over and we have to establish the Satya yuga. For which all of you from every country should have thought of how you can do it in your country, another country.

Put your attention outside not inside, this way that you say, I need this, I need that. You should know what other people need. What is their need. What the people in our society, in our nation, in our world require. Better write them down. What do they require? Better it will work. Might be it might be corrected. It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down and write down what the world needs. What is to be done. It will be a nice idea for all of you to aspire for that kind of homogenous society that we have here today and will be one day we will be surprised that we will be the ones who will guide and lead the rest of the people with our love, attention and care. So is a very important time and at this time we should all think on those lines.

Thank you very much. God bless you.
