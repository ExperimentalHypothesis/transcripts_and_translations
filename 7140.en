Conversation with yogis. Melbourne (Australia), 13 March 1983.

Warren: They are just asking questions, Mother.

Shri Mataji: What kind?

Warren: Just practical.

Shri Mataji: Practical? That’s good, practical questions are very good.

Warren: Would you like to talk to them for a while?

Shri Mataji: First I talk to them and then ask the questions.

I am overjoyed to see you all here. Actually the whole night I was working on Melbourne seekers, that they should come today and should establish their realisation very well.

Now we have to understand a few things about Sahaja Yoga very clearly and there is no compromise on these few things that we have to accept. Because, as I told you, Truth cannot compromise for you, you have to compromise for Truth.

So the first is that Sahaja Yoga is not just a precept, is not just a precept: it is practice. It is not just a mental idea. Now you got realisation, all right, but it is not sufficient. Even if you think that you got realisation so, now, you are all right, you become the Spirit, all right; but still, it is more a mental conception than a real identification.
So it is not that if you get your realisation, and you start the awakening of your Kundalini, starts very well. Still, it is to be understood that it is the practice of Sahaja Yoga which is more important than the precept of it.
There are many people in India who can’t read or write, who don’t have all these mental activities as you have and are not so complicated as you are [Shri Mataji is laughing]; some of them are aboriginal people, just living in the villages, very simple people. They get realisation, they feel the joy much faster than the complicated ones will and they just start working on it.
You have to work it out. This is not the compassion that speaks, talks, elaborates and advertises, but it works. Sahaja Yoga is a thing that works, the religion that works. And this is what we must understand first of all, that it is not the talking, it is not the precept that you are a great soul: you have to become.

Not that you are not, you are. But you have to be aware of it. More light has to flow into you.
Definitely, you must be something special to get it, no doubt. But you must allow your lamp to be cleared out, cleansed, so that more light is given. And it works wonders for people who honestly want to ascend in spirituality.

As I told you before also that it is a concept that many people have that Sahaja Yoga cures people. It is not true. It is just as a by-product it may cure you; just as a by-product.
So one must understand the blessing has come to you only because you are a seeker, you have done a lot of good in your past life and this life also and that God has chosen you to be in His Kingdom.

But it cannot be demanding, you cannot demand, you cannot demand anything from God, He has to give you because He knows what you deserve. And He gives you much much much more than what you deserve. I mean, I have seen people who have been in Sahaja Yoga that after one year they start asking, “Mother, what did we do to deserve all this?”. They just can’t believe it. I said, “Must be something, you must know there must be something that the blessings have come to you”.

This is one thing that one has to understand that you cannot make Sahaja Yoga compromise for you, you have to understand all the techniques and things about Sahaja Yoga.
Now the thing could be that you may start doubting, you see, so that’s what we have people who are doubting about it and doing all kinds of things; you see, in the beginning, they are rather slow movers. So we have to sort them out, to begin with, because the second stage of awareness is doubtless awareness: you are doubtless about yourself, doubtless about the working of Sahaja Yoga, doubtless about God’s existence, doubtless about His Laws. You become absolutely doubtless, not mentally, it’s a state, it’s a state of your being by which you achieve lots of results and you really become powerful: you can see your compassion so powerful, so discrete, so understanding, so forbearing. And you are amazed of yourself, you really become a saint in the real sense of the word, that you become humble, flowering, beautifully, not taking anything aggressive upon yourself; and you are really in the Kingdom of God that you feel that you are looked after, protected, guided, blessed, every moment you walk along.

And that’s the state everybody should aspire to reach this doubtless awareness; and unless and until you reach that state, we don’t call you Sahaja Yogi, you may start calling yourself, but that’s left to yourself. There are not sort of... we do not have sort of certification, or things going on; or we do not give any written certificates to people, nothing of the kind. It is you who have to certify yourself.

So gradually people grow up into beautiful beings. They start having their self esteem fully established, understanding themselves.

But practice of Sahaja Yoga must be done without thinking too much about it. First, you just try it, more trying – because if you start doubting, I tell you, your progress will be much less.
So first, just like a scientist, to try to accept one by... there is nothing that has to be done, you do not have to pay Me anything, of course, you do not have to do any acrobatics or anything.
But for example a small thing like my photograph, you see, many people say, “Why Your photograph?” So “Use your photograph,” I say, if that works out, you see. It is something surprising: that’s how people are challenging Me “Why Your photograph?”. “Why don’t you use yours? I will be very happy, use anybody’s”... but doesn’t work out, what to do now? It’s My photograph that works out, but even if you do not like it, you have to use it – what can I do?
Is as simple like that, you see, but in that, I do not gain anything from you, I do not want anything from you, nothing material that you can give Me. But you will enjoy, you will enjoy My love, you will enjoy. It is all for your own enjoyment, everything is done.

And this is a special time we are born in, we have a special responsibility.

Today we had a lady who came, her husband came, and they were saying that “We had a son who was very well equipped and he went to one of the gurus and he got completely ruined.”

And this particular guru we need to be rather careful about, it’s this Rajaneesh fellow. His disciples are rather difficult. They come to Sahaja Yoga, all right, but they are a very extreme type of people. They come with a great force to Sahaja Yoga, again go back; so all those who have been to Rajaneesh and have taken his initiation, have to be extremely careful.
All of you who have been to gurus must know that they will be again and again attacked. So you need to be rather patient with yourselves as we are with you, and must know that you must assert your will power a little bit, to come up, and shed off all that was screwed into your head... and you paid for it, you see. Forget it. Some time people say that “We have paid for it, so better have it”. That’s not the way. You’d better through it away. It is horrible, you have bought a snake on your head, on your neck. So just through away all these things that they have put you on.
You all forget it and become your Self, first of all, and become your own guru. Ask your vibrations, develop your vibratory awareness and grow with it.

Some people will find also that their vibrations are not showing very good results, some of you will find that kind of thing. And when you find that your vibrations are not working out in your hands and things, you should not get worried about it. Maybe your Vishuddhi chakra is not all right. There are ways and methods to improve your Vishuddhi chakra, by which you know the exact mantras to be said and how to improve it; and we also vibrated oil and all that, you can apply here. And also there are other methods by which you can improve your sinus. And if you have any problem with the Vishuddhi because of over-smoking or anything, there are so many ways which you can call the Grandmother’s medicine, simple, simple things which will work it out, should try to clear out.
So whatever centre is not working out, you should get after that and don’t worry about the centres that are good because those who are good are good. So we have to look after the centres which are in trouble and try to improve our centres and complete being has to be brought into balance.

Some people have some centres so badly off that, despite the fact they have all the centres all right, because of one centre, you see, they are in imbalance. So, the first thing in Sahaja Yoga is to establish a balance.

Now certain things about morality and all that, I do not want to talk to you; gradually your self will realise what is good for you and bad for you. But in Sahaja Yoga, you will be given a proper guidance as to what is to be done, how to lead a life and how to have a normal, good married life, how to have children, how to look after them, how to get to your parents.
So the social side also you can learn very well by which you really feel happy. But the main society that you have is that of Sahaja yogis. Of course, you do not have to cut off from anyone, you do not have to give up anyone. But you grow among Sahaja yogis, these are called sajñānas, you see. “Sa-jñāna”, the people who are the followers of Truth.

So once you come together, it is a collective happening and it works out more collectively and it helps you much more. But if you say “Individually, Mother, I can do it”, it does not work out. In Sahaja Yoga, I have seen, you do not go too far.

You all have to work it together, you have to meet. Luckily, you have a very good ashram here. You all can come and meditate and take a proper help from these people.

God has already blessed this place so much. And when I came to Melbourne, I stayed in a very small little house, with, I think, two bedrooms and some sort of a thing like that. And this time I find a big, huge thing given to you, and they may start here also a nice school for small children here. Your small children can go to that school where they can be looked after well, they won’t have any complications. And everything can be done at a much better level than what you find in mundane life.

Everything has a meaning, spiritual meaning, everything in life has a meaning! So you should try to find out whatever is good for your ascent and for your nourishing of your spiritual being!

I hope next time when I come, all of you will be great Sahaja Yogis and will be great people! Individually everyone will be working out on many people, and we have to change the face of Melbourne completely!

May God Bless you all.

So if you have any questions, you ask Me. Now...

Warren: Mother, there was one gentleman - he asked me a question. He has got a son at home; he is mentally disturbed. He was asking how he can deal with that. Because he won’t come. I suggested that first he and his wife should get it. This gentleman here, in the suit.

Shri Mataji: What’s the problem exactly? What is it called?

Seeker: Well, schizophrenia. He was very religious once.

Shri Mataji: Where did he go? To what place?

Warren: What religious cult? What religious group?

Seeker: Well, he belongs to the Catholic religion as I am.

Shri Mataji: What is that?

Warren: Catholic religion Mother. He himself is a Catholic and he is a great believer in Christ. His son became ...

Seeker: Just a moment. He had a love affair which did not go right.

Shri Mataji: With a?

Warren: I am just, I am not interrupting, I am just passing on. She does not hear you too clearly. He had a love affair and it did not go right.

Shri Mataji: What is his age?

Seeker: Pardon?

Shri Mataji: What is his age?

Warren: Age.

Seeker: Twenty-four now.

Shri Mataji: Now I don’t want to criticise Catholicism, because you see, as you are a believer of Christ, it is all right. But there are certain practices they have taken to, which are quite injurious to human beings.

Seeker: The thing is he is schizophrenic.

Shri Mataji: That can happen to any Catholic. Now, why? See, the reason I will tell you. Please be seated. If you listen to Me patiently, there are two things which they do very wrong. One is to build churches and then put all the dead bodies in it. It is absolutely absurd you see, to have a graveyard in the church. Absolutely. That is so dangerous.

Now I have had many Catholic people coming to Me. And they had very big problems with two centres. One is this back centre (Shri Mataji points to back Agyna) and another is this one (Shri Mataji shows left Vishuddhi). Of course, left Swadishthana is there because it is unauthorised. They are not realised souls and they cannot preach about God. They have no authority to preach about God. Or to baptise also.

No human being has got the authority to touch this precious place without being baptised. They themselves should be really baptised. Actualisation of baptism is needed. You think about it, logically. Anybody can become a priest you see, and you cannot elect them. It has to come from God, isn’t it? So that is one thing that is wrong there. And another thing they are always caught up is the left Vishuddhi, is here.

When they do this confession business, you see - who are these priests to confess to? Actually, I have seen the priests also go mad. So many priests have come to Me. Because the people have confessed to them. And in that confession, poor - the priests have gone off their heads. Because they couldn’t bear it anymore you see. The kind of confessions people did, that - “I have murdered someone, I have done this and that”. And they couldn’t keep it you see; their conscience couldn’t keep it in themselves.

So one has to face it clearly; anybody can get mad like that. I have known people who really got very mad. So one has to understand that you must get your realisation first of all.

Seeker: But Mother, when I pray, I know that - he really calms down.

Shri Mataji: He will. Of course, I agree.

Seeker: It has done him a lot of good. He cannot be cured, but it changes him.

Shri Mataji: Must be. Because if you pray to Christ, He will definitely help. But not through your church. What I am saying, must be...

Seeker: No, no, no [UNCLEAR]. I am a believer in Christ.

Shri Mataji: All right. That’s all right. Then it's all right. But what I am saying, that, to get a complete connection with God or with Christ, you have to be born again, isn’t it? So you must get your realisation.

Seeker: Yes.

Shri Mataji: And if you can get your realisation, you can help your son immensely, all right?

Seeker: That is what I want.

Shri Mataji: So you all must get realisation. All parents who are interested in their children; all children who are interested in their parents, must get their realisation.

Seeker: I want to tell you Mother, that since he became sick four years ago, I have turned to Christ more than ever. And I have found very great comfort. And I have found all the answers. That is why I want to help You.

Shri Mataji: Yes, but one thing must be ...

Seeker: I know that this life is a lie. The life we are leading is a lie. I know that.

Shri Mataji: So you must understand Christ and get your realisation in a better way, in a fuller way, in a real way, how He helps you. Otherwise, you cannot understand Him. Superficially how far can you go? He’s been kind to you, but now you have to be more realistic about Him. All right?

Seeker: That is why I wanted to bring him to you.

Shri Mataji: No, don’t bring your son. We can work it out. Have you got a photograph of his?

Seeker: I haven’t got it, but I can bring it to you.

Shri Mataji: All right. You send Me the photograph. All right? I can work ....

Seeker: I can send you the photograph.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s better. You send Me the photograph. To our Sydney address. When I will be going...

Seeker: You will be going. I will give it to one of [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: No, no. You can give it to one of them. They will bring it along. All right? That’s all. Now what else, My child?

Seeker: [UNCLEAR].

Warren: He is asking whether there are different degrees of Kundalini awakening because he has heard or read there - that can be very dangerous.

Shri Mataji: No, it's not. It is all people who are absolutely; you see, they - people as I told you the other day that a person comes from the village and puts his fingers into the holes of a plug and says it is the electricity gives you the shock and something like that.

But I, I can assure you that Kundalini is never, never dangerous. She is your mother. But, there is another centre down below which might sometimes give you a little heat or some sparking in the finger. Or maybe a little electrical discharge. For a while. Just for a while. If there is a problem. On that centre. A little bit, not much. But you can gradually feel that cool breeze after the tingling is over. In the beginning, you might feel a little tingling.

So far I have given realisation, I think, to so many people. The Sahaja Yoga has worked out so well. Nobody has suffered. Everybody has gained.

But if you have been to some guru. For example, take, say, people who have been to say, Mahesh Yogi. Now, about thirty people came to Me and only I could save eight of them. Because of the rest of them; they used to come, go back, come, go back. Like that, to that state. I could save only eight of them because they were so badly damaged you see. But even, they went back to the lunatic asylum, this, that - but still they were remembering Me. I don’t know, they are still coming out, going in, like that. So they take time.

But it is not, never dangerous. It tries to improve you. Even when I go you will find it will gradually rise and tickle you here and there. It is a very kind, compassionate mother of yours who has been with you all your lives. And now she is anxious to establish your realisation. She is one who gives your second birth. So she cannot be unkind.

See, she is your pure mother. She has no interest in you but to give you your second birth. And she is your individual mother. Of course, some of you have harmed her very much. I have seen her very much upset. But doesn’t matter. She looks after you. She is the one who does all this job. She is the one who cures you, she is one who gives you realisation, she is the one who gives you peace, she is the one who takes you to the Spirit.

All right? So nothing; don’t have any fears. May God Bless You.

This is all funny people. You see, everybody has written about Kundalini. I am Myself, I am amazed. They had no fear of God, no fear of anything - all lies, they have written. And those who really suffered must be unauthorised, horrible people who must have tried.

You have to have a proper, holy life, isn’t it? You have to be a holy person. Because Kundalini is a kanya, means a virgin. Now imagine, they call the sleeping serpent on this Ayers Rock you see - called the “kuniya”. That is what it is - Kundalini is a virgin. Can you imagine how it is so much so here?

And if you see the photographs, it is all Ganesha’s things. Absolutely the same colour, everything - just imagine. I told them a long time back when he met Me first, that your country is the country of Mooladhara. And then he sent Me this photograph from there. And I saw and I was amazed - even the trunk is there. Can you imagine? And the whole colour, everything is the same. You have such a blessing of God; why should you worry?

Your land is very holy. Is a holy land. Is written about this land. In the ancient books of India, where a saint was, had done something wrong. So God cursed him. And said, “You will go”, is called Trishanku - your Southern Cross. That you will go to a land and you will create a heaven there for yourself. See, first, he was cursed to go in the Southern Hemisphere. And then it was told that you will create your own heaven. That is what it is.

Warren: They may have not heard of the word Southern Cross, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Southern Cross. You know the Southern Cross. It is called as Trishanku. It was hanging down, hanging upside down. And the curse was, a little bit concession given we can say. As a concession to him that, “No because you are a saint, you will create your own heaven”. That’s what it is, Australia.

“Aus” itself is, “terra” means the land and “aus” is “antariksha” (space) - antariskha means what?

Warren: There is a lady, blind lady up there who is asking questions.

Shri Mataji: What is she saying?

[UNCLEAR/seeker is speaking].

Warren: No.

[UNCLEAR/seeker continues speaking].

Warren: A Christian scientist, practitioner told her once there is no such thing as birth. Is that correct?

Shri Mataji: Do you believe him? What good has he done to the world? They can say anything. You must ask, “What good have they done to the world?”. All right. What is the criteria, see, of a saint? Must find. Everybody can talk about God. Who is going to check them? Even Hitler talked on God, even Napoleon talked, I don’t know. See, you must understand if they have any right to talk? Are they saintly people? All these Christian scientists, do you think they are saintly people? Have they done any saintly work?

Warren: He does healing work.

Shri Mataji: You see, you can also heal with spirits. With dead spirits. That’s one thing you can do. Horrible. Keep away from them.

(To Warren): She doesn’t know what she is talking about.

Warren: Any other question?

Shri Mataji: You see, anybody can say anything. I am not here answerable to them. There can be a lot of mad people, funny people, people who are anti-God, any sort. What I am talking is talking for myself. All right? What is she saying?

Warren: She brought some sugar and she would like Your vibrations.

Shri Mataji: All right. I will give you but what about your eyes?

Warren: She’s got very poor vision.

Shri Mataji: All right. Now for that, we have to work out for you, all right? We will tell you what is to be done. Have you got somebody to be with you? Have you got someone with you, who lives with you?

Warren: We could show them.

Shri Mataji: All right. We can tell you what is to be done. That can be cured. All right? That thing can be done. So you have to come back again. And they will tell you precisely what is to be done. So work it out. You can get back your vision. All of you who have got poor vision also must know what is to be done about it. What is it?

Seeker: Hearing.

Shri Mataji: Healing? Yes, yes, hearing can also be done.

Warren: Hearing can also be done.

Seeker: Migraine?

Warren: Migraine.

Shri Mataji: Of course, migraine, headache can be worked out very easily, no doubt. Yes, of course, migraine is very simple.

Seeker: High blood pressure.

Warren: High blood pressure.

Shri Mataji: Of course. He is another; he had high blood pressure.

Seeker: What can you about healing my granddaughter?

Warren: She was born partially deaf; that may be a little more difficult.
Seeker: Yes, she's three years.

Shri Mataji: It is all right - still we will work it out. It is, what I am saying is, you don’t have to pay for it, you don’t have to do anything - if it works out, well and good. You should try. You should try everything, all right, but...

[UNCLEAR/Seeker is asking].

Warren: She brought her with her.

Shri Mataji: Good. Where is she?

Seeker: In the car. I will go and get her?

Shri Mataji: All right. We will see. Little later, little later, all right. Let’s finish the whole thing. What else?

Seeker: Falling of the hair.

Shri Mataji: What’s she....

Warren: Falling hair.

Shri Mataji: You have?

Warren: Falling hair. Alopecia.

Shri Mataji: You have the kind where you lose part, part...

Warren: Yes, clumps of hair goes.

Shri Mataji: That we have got cured now.

Warren: Where's [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: He's much better.
[UNCLEAR/Seeker asking a question].

Shri Mataji: Who is it?

Warren: What’s the question?

[UNCLEAR/Seeker explains].

Shri Mataji: We will work it out. You come for the first time. We will work it out.

Warren: How will we get Kundalini awakening, he says.

Shri Mataji: We will work it out. His Agyna is too much. What, are you Christian or...? Your centre of Christ is catching so badly. Just imagine. We will work it out. All right? Doesn’t matter.

What Christ has said, “Humble down yourself in your heart”. First of all, humble down yourself in your heart. Then it works out. Humble down. All right? Agyna. This centre is very important. It works out better, you see.

Don’t take up responsibility upon yourself. God is doing everything for you. Don’t worry.

Seeker: Earlier on, we heard that, that there is God in everyone. But some people are good and some are bad. But if God is in all people, who will decide if something is bad, God is bad?

Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

Warren: Earlier on, he heard it said there is God in all people. But if there are bad people, how is it that we can reach such a conclusion?

Shri Mataji: You see, you should not decide mentally who is good and who is bad. And you should not give up anyone as such; as an absolutely wretched person. But on vibrations you can help quite a lot of people. Some of them you have to give up. But you just can’t help it, you just can’t help it. You can try.

Like people are getting drowned, all right?. They are overloaded with things. You can bring, in the West, say about forty per cent people. And twenty more with little effort or quite a great effort. And ten more with really great struggle with them. But such an ego-oriented society; it is difficult to reach them. Because the ego covers them completely.

But never discard anyone; just try. But don’t try very difficult words just now. Try simple words. When we want to first learn a new language, we try simple words, you see. In the same way, first, try simple people. But don’t discard anyone, but postpone. Till you become a master. Then you can try the most difficult ones also. But just now don’t think of the difficult ones.

Normally what happens, people stick on to someone very difficult, like an ego challenge. “I must transform” - and then you go wrong. You don’t have to transform anyone, God has to do it. But as you are a beginner, try with simple people. All right?

Warren: You spoke about Ayers Rock. What was it you were saying?

Shri Mataji: Ayers Rock is the first centre. Which shows. The deity of the first centre. It's very vibrated. You get tremendous vibrations from it. And the whole story about it they will let you later on. Because, actually I told him that the centre is, the first centre is - and then they sent Me the photograph of the Ayers Rock. It is true. It has vibrations. Such a great thing that has come out of the Mother Earth.

Seeker: What vibrations? Will it vibrate?

Shri Mataji: Holy vibrations.

Seeker: Evil?

Shri Mataji: Good.

Seeker: Holy vibrations?

Shri Mataji: Holy vibrations.

Seeker: Ayers Rock?

Warren: From primordial times. From way back.

Shri Mataji: It has come from Mother Earth. Which is told in the Bible. That you shall now worship anything that is created by Mother Earth. Now, what is created by Mother Earth? We should not reproduce and worship. But whatever is created by Mother Earth. And this is one of them. You have got such a great thing here.

It is tremendous. When you become aware of it, you will be amazed. It just emits vibrations all over. But people who are evil, who are following black magic, wrong practices - may call it an evil one. Because for them, you see, it is evil, isn’t it? Because that destroys all black magic and all that.

Seeker: Something’s gone wrong with my Kundalini. It has been burning at the bottom of my spine for years.

Shri Mataji: When was this? How many years back?

Seeker: Must have been four years.

Warren: Did you go to anybody?

Shri Mataji: Did you go to anyone?

Seeker: Maharishi.

Warren: Maharishi.

Shri Mataji: Oh! That’s a difficult fellow. But I will work it out. You sit down on Mother Earth. Maharishi is one person; is horrid.

Warren: Take your shoes out.

Shri Mataji: Take it out.

Warren: This is a good example.

Shri Mataji: But despite all this you see, nobody has made a very joint effort. Why don’t you write to our government or someone? You see, it can be done. Actually, when I talk to the government people - because I am quite highly connected. My brother himself is a government minister. I know the President and everyone there. What they said is that is it You only who says these things. I openly say. But nobody says anything you see; nobody has anything written against.

So if you people write from here, join together that they have taken so much money from us, they have ruined us, they have done this and that, isn’t it? Then it will be better. Because they think that you are all very much satisfied with them. And it so happens that in the beginning, some people come, they get ruined; the others come. It’s like a moving train, you see, that takes passengers ahead. And the passengers who have suffered are left behind without any combined effort.

But in Paris, they have started a thing like that now. Which is a very good thing. Which is trying to oppose this. But unless and until you write something, I don’t know how to take up with the government.

(To a seeker): What’s it?

Seeker: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji (to Warren): This one is talking too much.

Warren: Look, you have asked quite a few questions. We will give this one to Mother and we will make it the last.

Seeker: [UNCLEAR/asks a question].

Warren: Doctor McDonald Baynes who was a writer on the spiritual who lived in the Himalayas says there is a celestial city near the Dandenong ranges which is nearby to Melbourne here. What are your views?

Shri Mataji: I haven’t seen them as yet. But must be, must be celestial here, no doubt. Is it towards the sea, the Southern side?

Warren: In the mountains, towards the...what is it, the east? To the east.

Shri Mataji: I don’t know this Baynes fellow, how much to depend on him also.

Warren: He’s not realised.

Shri Mataji: I think so.

Warren: He has good vibrations, but not realised.

Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Makes no difference, you see. You have to have vibrations. What is the use of having these ranges around? You better have them.

Now done, everyone?

How many of you did feel the cool breeze the other day? Raise your hands.

Warren: Put your both hands up so Mother can see.

A lot of them haven’t been before.

Shri Mataji: If you all put your hands, let us see how many of you feel again.

Just sit down, comfortably, put your hands towards Me.

You can’t sit like that. Can you get some chair for the lady? Just, there are some chairs. You get a chair. You are not supposed to sit with your feet towards Me. It is not regarded as good, all right? Better take chairs. I am sorry. I know why you feel...you can put the chair here on the sides. Come along.

Then you, that’s what it is. Then you can’t...hello, how are you? Put yourself like that or you can sit on the chair. Come along, it is all right. Just come here. If you have to sit on the chair, it is all right. Doesn’t matter.

Warren: Sit on [UNCLEAR]. Any flat surface.

Shri Mataji: Anyway, anyway, but not towards Me, you see. You just can’t put your feet like that. That’s what it is supposed to be. Doesn’t matter, after all, you are children. And I am the Mother. Doesn’t matter what you do.

Some of them are great people over here.

Now, put your hands towards Me like this. I think, better close your eyes. Can you take out this a little? I will put My feet on the ground. Mother Earth.

Warren: Would you like me to pull the chair forward?

Shri Mataji: It's all right.

What’s the matter with the lady? Are you shaking too much? You been to some clairvoyant person? That’s the reason. All right. You come sit on the Mother grass, all right, would be better.

Warren: Sit on the grass.

Shri Mataji: Anyone shaking there? Anyone shaking in the body? Keep your eyes open and sit on the Mother Earth. She takes away the problem. If you have been to a clairvoyant or someone, you may.

Seeker: [UNCLEAR/asks a question].

Warren: That’s all right.

Shri Mataji: If you are not shaking it’s all right. Everyone doesn’t get affected but some do, you see, it's those horrible things they do. Sit on the Mother Earth, it’s better. What’s she saying?

Warren: A bit giddy.

Shri Mataji: You have been to some clairvoyant person? No? Better sit on the Mother Earth. You have been to some clairvoyant person? Been to a guru? No?

(To Warren): Must be having a liver.

All right, come along here, let me see. She has a liver. Very bad liver you have. Did you feel giddy also before?

Seeker: I just had a serious operation.

Shri Mataji: What operation?

Seeker: Brain surgery.
Shri Mataji: What?

Warren: Brain surgery.

Shri Mataji: Keep your eyes open all right. Don’t close them. Keep your eyes open. You had an accident? Doesn’t matter.

Nabhi is too much. Keep your eyes open, please. How are you feeling now? Still giddy? Better? Would you like to lie down? We can get you a pillow. All right. Better lie down. You can let her lie down here. You can lie down here.

Warren: Come over here.

Shri Mataji: Put the pillow. Put the pillow on that side and the feet at the back. Let her lie down.

Warren: Put your head down here.

Shri Mataji: Don’t cry. Don’t cry. You are going to be alright. You just don’t worry. Put your head here. Towards Me. Yes, just...You have to work it out. Don’t cry. You wanted to see Me, is it? Or lie this way. Parallel to [UNCLEAR], will be better.

It shows, you see. If there is any problem, it shows, it shows. Just lie down. Be comfortable. Will work out. Don’t you worry. You are going to be all right.

(To all): It's good, fine. May God Bless You. All right?

Now those who are feeling the cool breeze, already, can get up and see others, who cannot feel it. And you can stand behind one person. I will teach (you) how to give them realisation also. Can be done now. All right. Those who are really feeling the cool breeze, can get up.

It’s a good idea to help others. Yes. Let’s have it.

Warren: Can the Sahaja Yogis do the same thing.

Shri Mataji: Also the Sahaja Yogis. Those who are feeling the cool breeze. Come along.

[In the transcript that follows, Shri Mataji is addressing all seekers sometimes and sometimes speaking to different seekers in turns].

Now, all of you should put your left hand towards Me and right hand on top of the head of the person. On top, not touching, not touching. Higher. Like this, yes. See. It works better. You act as a sort of wire, thing. It passes. See, now, ha, better?

[Seeker giving realisation is nodding yes].

All right. You feeling it? Now get up. You can get up. Those who are feeling can get up. Now, are you better now? Not yet.

You put your right hand out like that. The Indian gentleman. Right hand. Like this, at the back, yes. And put left towards Me.

All right? Good. You getting it? Are you? No, not yet. It will work out. Don’t you worry.

Maybe some of you can put your left hand with the right hand like this. It will work out. Left towards Me and right hand out. No, no, left towards Me and the right like that (raised upward). Just try, some of you. If it works out better. Or the other way round.

She’s got it. You feeling it? Good. She’s got it. Now work on ....you feeling now? Good, good. It’s good. Put it like that and this one like that (back of right hand raised upward). You can put it towards Me. The right hand. One hand has to be towards Me.

Put one hand towards Me. That’s it. Like that. Now, tell her also. Put the other hand, the way she is doing. No. Yes, good. Good.

Are you feeling? No. Sit on the Mother Earth. Move on the Mother Earth more.

Now try another lady. Yes, yes, you go on trying. She’s very good. She doing very good. Just put one hand towards Me. Simple. Is it?

Seeker: Hot vibration.

Shri Mataji: But not cool. Not cool as yet.

Seeker: Not much though.

Shri Mataji: It will, it will work out. What about you? Not yet? Try on her. Maybe.

Seeker: Very hot, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You are feeling hot? On her? What’s the problem? You think too much, do you?

Seeker: I don't know what I'm supposed to be feeling?

Shri Mataji: You feel the cool breeze on the hand do you? No, no. No, no. That’s a different thing. You feel a sensation in your hand. No?

All right? She’s good. It's rising, it's rising. She’s got it.

You got it. Not feeling it? Can you take out that necklace a little bit? Sometimes that also affects.

Are you better, My child? Better now? Good. Put your left hand up that way. All right? It will work out.

Is she better? Little bit. Improving. Put your hand like this (outstretched). Have patience with yourself. You must have some patience with yourself. That’s the main point.

Better now? Better? Yes, it is. Working out? Better.

Keep your eyes open. Tell her to keep her eyes open.

All right? Better? No? Her Vishuddhi is not all...yes?

Very hot? All right. She has been to some guru? No one. To no clairvoyant or anyone? Not at all?

Put your left hand on the right-hand side of your stomach.

Is it all right? Put your left hand on the Mother Earth. Like that, yes. And right hand towards Me.

Like that (outstretched).

Did you feel the cool breeze? Good. Why not work on these two gentlemen? This gentleman and this lady?

Did you feel? No? All right, you get up and work on them. Not on your relations or friends all right? Other people. That’s important. In the beginning. It’s better now? No? No?

He is a very difficult, horrible person. One of the worst you can think of. Mahesh Yogi.

And how much money has amassed do you know? We have someone there from him. The whole family is ruined. Terrible.

Seeker: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Is it? Comes and goes. All right. Don’t think. Just watch Me without thinking. If it comes. Are you better?

(To Warren): She has an Agyna, I think. This lady.

What about you? Did you feel? Good.

He has to put his left hand on his stomach. Liver, you see. Liver and Vishuddhi both the center.
He is difficult. He is very difficult. You sit on Mother Earth. He is difficult. He’s from that horrible Satya Sai Baba. He’s the worst. Till you get a heart attack he won’t leave you.

Put your right hand on Mother Earth and left hand towards Me.

Is she better? Little hot is she? She has a liver too.

Hello? You put your left hand on your stomach. Right side. Right side. Right side, yes.

Who is the gentleman with migraine? You have got migraine?

Seeker: No, my wife has it. My wife has it, I have nothing!

Shri Mataji: All right. You watch at Me. Watch this side, you see. Don’t watch other people.

She? She’s all right. She has a liver. So many have livers, livers - I don’t know why.

What about this lady? Did she feel any? Good, good.

But keep your hands (outstretched), have more. You see, I am here for a short time. I will go away.

Now don’t put your shoes towards Me, all right. If you can take out, thank you.

Is she crying? Put her right to the left.

You are all right. She’s got it.

I can see from your eyes.

Good. You are doing a good job.

Seeker:  Mother, can I ask you, I know I shouldn't be asking you questions but I've been ill for twelve years, with kidneys and [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Now no more. It's finished. It is done. Got some water for Me?

Seeker: You saw me at a lecture.

Shri Mataji: Did you bring water?

Seeker: No, I have been drinking the water you gave me.

Shri Mataji: Good. You are all right. No kidneys, nothing. Finished.

Did you go on the machine anytime?

Seeker: What machine?

Shri Mataji: That they do circulation and all that.

Seeker: No.

Shri Mataji: Thank God. Then its all right.

What about this gentleman here? Did you feel? Hot? Hot? You put your hand on your stomach, on the right-hand side. Can you?

What is it? Can you try this gentleman here? He will be all right.

Keep your eyes open. This lady. Ask her also to open her eyes. Very pale.

What about you? Left hand? Not right hand?

You also put your left hand on the stomach, on the right-hand side.

Good. It will work out. It will slowly work out in everyone.

Good. You still have? All right. Come along here.

Can you sit facing that side? I have to put My foot if you don’t mind.

Seeker: On the back? Lovely.

Shri Mataji: No, I think it's here. There are certain exercises you have to do for this. But in any case, I will cure you now. This will dissolve out.

How are these people? Are you all right? Good. I am happy you are working it out. From Mauritius, yes.

Good, good, I am happy.

They are not getting it? They will, they will. All of them have to get it. Don’t you worry.

Some ossification(?) has taken place. What were you doing?

Seeker: Hatha yoga.

Shri Mataji: Hatha yoga! That’s it, without your [UNCLEAR]. I was wondering how it's gone into that.

Seeker: It is difficult.

Shri Mataji: It is horrible. Stop all Hatha yoga. No, no, no, no. I will tell you what exercises are to be done. For everyone, not the same exercise - there is a different exercise. I will tell what exercise is to be done. All right?

Good. Enjoy.

Is he all right? He’s been to some guru or someone?

No, not you. Him. Have you been?

Seeker: I don't believe in gurus.

Shri Mataji: No? Thank God. But...

Seeker: I practice meditation.

Shri Mataji: Your own?

Seeker: No not my own, it's Buddhist meditation.

Shri Mataji: That’s it. That’s just the same. Just the same, all right?

Ask him to put his right hand towards Me and left hand on his stomach. And say, “Mother, make me my own guru”.

Just, that would be...Better now, madam? All right?

Seeker: There is blue light in the Agyna centre.

Shri Mataji: No, that should not be seen. All must go away. It’s a horrible thing.

You ought to be. You are to become the light. The light does not see the light, does it?

You have to become. Not see something. If you see the sky, you don’t become the sky, do you?

But when you are the sky, you don’t see the sky. All right?

Now better?

What about you? Didn’t feel it? Don’t be upset about it. Nothing to be - you have a liver problem, do you know that. That’s all. It’s very simple. Now do one thing. You put your right hand towards Me and left hand on the Mother Earth. Just on the backside. No, that side. Behind your hand. Yes. It will work out. Now don’t get upset.

Nobody should be upset. Now those who are not feeling anything, please raise your hand. Let’s see.

Keep your hands raised, all right?

You put both your hands (raised up) and say, “Mother, is this the power of God? Is this the power of Brahma?. Is this the Brahmashakti?”.

Are you feeling, some of you? Don’t doubt it, you see. It’s a kind of feeling you get in your fingers. Raise them higher. Let’s see.

You are all right.

Higher, on your heads. It's there. Feeling it now? It’s there. Good. Are you feeling?

Seeker: Tingling. Tingling.

Shri Mataji: Tingling? Tingling has to go away a little bit.

You can put both your hands on the Mother Earth now. Now let’s see. On the Mother Earth. For a while. There’s tingling.

Now just see. Tingling has gone? Raise your hands and see. Tingling is gone.

Better?

[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone several times].

It's better now. All right, now bring it down (hands towards Mother), see.

Seeker: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Let her sit on the Mother Earth. Is she sitting on the Mother Earth? Let her put her left hand on the Mother Earth. Is she been to some guru?

Warren: It's a man. He’s getting hotter and hotter. Have you been to a guru?

Shri Mataji: Rajneesh?

Warren: Has he been to a guru? An Indian fellow or...? Muktananda.

[Shri Mataji leans to one side with Her eyes closed and hand on Her forehead for some time].

Shri Mataji: Put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the Mother Earth. You have to work hard I must tell you, this Muktananda.

Warren: He had only one visit to the centre. Was it by him, himself or by the people? Was it the guru himself?

[Shri Mataji gives a bandhan and claps Her right hand on Her left hand quickly].

Shri Mataji: He is catching so much on left Swadishthana.

Warren: Yes, they were affected quite badly.

Shri Mataji (continuing to clap right palm on left): His left Swadishthana is catching very badly.

Better now? Are they cooler? Good, good, it's working out.

Warren: Even if you go to meetings where you don’t get initiated, but mixing with these people, you get so affected.

Shri Mataji: Of course. You see, to get dirty is easy, isn’t it? But to get holy is difficult.

Seeker: I've been hot and my hands radiant heat and my body has gotten very, very hot.

Shri Mataji: Why don’t you sit on the Mother Earth? She will clear out.

Warren: She will clear out.

Shri Mataji: Which meetings you have been to?

Warren: She visits any.

Shri Mataji: Let the Mother Earth help you. All right, come along on the Mother Earth. Please. All right? That’s a very good thing. Mother Earth, those who are sitting are better helped, yes. It’s all for that.

Warren: Anyone who’s not feeling should move on the earth.

Shri Mataji: She helps. Definitely helps, definitely helps.

Even if you are sitting on this impervious material (laughing), something artificial is stuck inside those.

Warren: Take your shoes off too.

Shri Mataji: It’s very pleasant today, isn’t it?

How is he? Keep his eyes open. He’s got all this, Hamsa. Keep your eyes open.

Warren: He’s been to Muktananda and he’s got it. But he can’t feel it, unfortunately.

Shri Mataji: Hamsa, you see. Hamsa is there. Hamsa and Vishuddhi both.

You get it, sinus? So only Hamsa.

All people who have been to gurus put your left hand towards Me and right hand on Mother Earth. That’s the simple thing as that.

Let him sit on the Mother Earth. Let him work it out.

Warren: Left hand towards Mother. Right hand on the earth. If you have been to a guru and see if it works out.

Shri Mataji: It will improve your, always improve your sensitivity. See, better.

[Shri Mataji is rubbing Her left Agyna finger].

He is a Hamsa fellow, problem with his [UNCLEAR] also. What are you wearing in your hand? Take it out. Right Vishuddhi. You can take it out for a while.

You sit on the Mother Earth. All right? It is better. It’s good.

Warren: Anyone having problems, come up to the front here.

Shri Mataji: On the Mother Earth. Mother Earth helps you, the sun helps you, the light helps you. Everything helps you.

All right let’s see. What the problem is now. Can you take out the cross for a while, for a while, just for a while? If you could.

Ha! Been to a Muktanand? He’s horrible - gives such a bad Vishuddhi and what’s this, Ekadasha?

Keep your eyes open, My child. Keep your eyes open. Watch Me, please.

I will let you know. It’s all right. I am talking to him. Don’t you worry. We will clear it out.

Are you all right? She has what?

Warren: She has Vishuddhi.

Shri Mataji: She’s been to some guru?

She will be all right. She will be all right. Whom do you worship? Whom do you worship?

Seeker: Ram, Shri Ram.

Shri Mataji: All right. Ask her to say the mantra.

Just let her put her left hand on the heart. Right heart. Right heart.

Just ask her. It is good. It will work out in no time.

Just see on her head. Good.

The time has come for you to recognise and get the reward for all your bhakti, isn’t it? The time has to come. May God Bless You.

Indians are very easy to handle. Ask her. Is she an Indian lady?

Krishna. All right. Good. Better. Close your eyes now. Enjoy.

Good. All right? (Laughing) We have to get over all these evil forces, isn’t it? You have to.

Are you all right, My child? All right?

You can come here, on the Mother Earth. Anyone who needs help, come along. Come here.

Warren: She is feeling it too, the other lady. She’s from Ceylon. She’s asked, “Are you Krishna?”.

Shri Mataji: All right. Now keep both the hands. Enjoy. Is she, what’s your name please? She’s from Ceylon?

Someone: She’s from India.

Seeker: Prabha.

Shri Mataji: Prabha? And the surname?

Seeker: Rao.

Shri Mataji: Prabha Rao. All right. It will work out in no time. You put your bag on the ground below and put both your hands towards Me.

It will work out Mrs Rao. Sit down. Yes. Be comfortable. Be comfortable.

Better? Are you?

Seeker: I feel so very tired.

Shri Mataji: It’s horrible, I tell you. We have to work it and work it out. It will work out, all right? Don’t give up. Patience. Touch your (hand), Mother Earth. Little. You have lost your fingers?

Seeker: Yes.

Shri Mataji: How?

Seeker: From a saw.

Shri Mataji (to another seeker): Are you? Put your, no, no, put your left hand on the Mother Earth. Left hand.

Now, what about you My child? You feel it and goes away, is it? Put your right hand towards Me.

Right hand like that. Put it on your, on your lap. All right? Comfortably on the Mother Earth. At the back. Just be relaxed, be relaxed. Gradually it will work out. It’s like the power flowing.

Seeker: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Hamsa. What is it? I couldn’t hear. What is the word he is using? In Sanskrit, you are saying something? I didn’t follow your word. Just ask him. What word is he using in Sanskrit language?

Warren: Varashamsa.

Shri Mataji: Varsamsha is not a Sanskrit word, My child. Who’s told you? It’s not a Sanskrit word.

Warren: He’s chanting mantras of a guru.

Shri Mataji: No, no, just don’t do any mantras. Don’t chant. Don’t chant just now. You have to learn the whole science about it, all right? Don’t chant.

Don’t do any chanting of mantras. You have to know the whole science about it. You have to do it with your closed eyes and closed brains. Have to understand why you have to do it.

Put your hand like this (left towards Mother), My child. In the blue.

It works out better this way. Better?

[Sahaja Yogi is talking to Shri Mataji about someone who is attending the workshop].

Shri Mataji: And then? He had it, before? What cancer?

[Sahaja Yogi points to right abdomen].

Shri Mataji: You got pain there? Just watch him. On the Vishuddhi. Can you, Warren, look after the gentleman there?

It’s all right. You see, all these are chakras which are showing. He has a right Swadishthana. What sort of a cancer? He’s been to any guru?

Sahaja Yogi: Have you been to any guru at all or nothing?

Shri Mataji: On the right-hand side you have a liver? Cirrhosis or something? Where do you have it? In the liver? Muscle?

Put your left up like that. Left hand like that, yes, left hand. Right towards Me.

Can you bring some vibrated water? Put it on his feet. So the Mother Earth can take away. Or ordinary water. Just put it on his feet.

Are you better now?

Shri Mataji: There’s no breeze passing.

Seeker: Only the physical one.

Shri Mataji: No, no, not physical. It will be all right. You just stay, we will tell you, if you have got it or not.

Ask this lady to put her hand towards Me like that (right hand flat outstretched). This way. Towards Me, you have put like you are asking for something. This one. You are all right. You got it.

Now still those haven’t felt any cool breeze, raise your hand, please.

Warren: He has a cancer of the muscle behind the right side.

Shri Mataji: Is he, has he been running too much? Now stop all that jogging business. Everything you do to such an extreme. Jogging, sun tanning, I mean it’s madness. I just don’t understand.

Going too far with your body. Then you develop cancer, you develop this problem, that problem. What is the need to tan yourself to that extent? Now give up that jogger of yours. Some possessions to do this kind of madness. Even old people of eighty years are jogging - I don’t know for what?

(Laughing) They look quite funny, don’t they? To Me, I don’t know, if you feel that. You must accept your age and live with it. And be decent about it.

The more grown-up you are, the more mature you are.

We can’t be horses, can we? (Laughing) All kinds of fads we accept; we shouldn’t. It’s not sensible. No common sense in that.

Better. Are you better sir? Muktananda is it? Did...Muktananda? You know how much money he’s got now?

Warren: His estate.

Shri Mataji: He’s got sixty thousand - he’s dead now - He’s got sixty thousand crores. I don’t know if you understand crores.

Warren: Six billion. Six thousand million.

Shri Mataji: Six thousand million worth of diamonds he’s got. And both the disciples are fighting now. You must have also contributed to that.

Are you all right? Better, Mrs Rao?

Mrs Rao: I haven't so much tingling now.

Shri Mataji: No, it's better. It is passing. It will work out. You see, gradually it will work out. Have patience in yourself.

Better, aren’t you? Put on your hand (on the head). Left, Left hand. Just see if there’s a cool breeze.

Warren: Don’t look. Just put your attention there.

Shri Mataji: All right? It will work out.

How are you? Are you better? Be peaceful. First thing you feel is peaceful. You feel your peace within yourself.

Now if the people who haven’t got it; if you raise your hands.

Can you attend to them, some of the Sahaja Yogis? Where are the Sahaja Yogis now? Can you attend to the people who haven’t got it? One or two. Please keep your hands raised.

This lady hasn’t got it yet? What’s the problem with this one? What’s the problem? Are you keeping all right, your health is all right, My child? What’s the problem? Come here.

You fell down?

Seeker: No, motor car accident.

Warren: Motor car accident.

Shri Mataji: Ah, that’s why.

Seeker: Also I am on medication.

Shri Mataji: Medication?

Seeker: Of lithium.

Warren: Lithium. She’s an alcoholic. Are you an alcoholic?

Seeker: No. Yes.

Warren: She’s an alcoholic. A little bit of drugs, everything. She’s addicted.

Shri Mataji: All right. Sit down. Turn around. All right?

Now put your, take your feet that side (in front) and sit on the ground. Can you? Or can you give her a seat or something to sit down? It’s all right? Can you?

[Seeker sits down and Shri Mataji puts Her feet on her back].

Shri Mataji: Ah, it’s terrible. It’s all right, but it’s working out.

Warren: The right side.

Shri Mataji: I know, it is the right side. Yes, my child?

Seeker: My hands are warm on the inside, cold on the outside.

Warren: They are warm on the inside and cold on the outside.

Shri Mataji: All right. Now put it up like that. (Palm raised up, moving vibrations with the other hand from the back of the hand to front). Just take it out like that. No, no, no...

Warren: Up, up and down. Up and down (up from the back of the wrist to fingers and down on the front side).

Shri Mataji: Some people haven’t got as yet attended? Ask somebody else? Some of the girls can come out.

Have they made the rice alright?

Warren: I don’t know Mother.

Shri Mataji: They prepared the rice. Have you got some plates and things?

This lady hasn’t been attended to, just see.

Warren: Which one?

Shri Mataji: This one.

Seeker: [UNCLEAR/trouble with veins].

Shri Mataji: Veins? I will work it out. All right.

Seeker: It doesn’t really worry me. [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: It worries Me (laughing).

Better now My child? Still the pain?

Seeker: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Still taking a lot of these drugs are you?

[Seeker is nodding yes].

Sahaja Yogi: The lady is coming in forty minutes at the most. Forty minutes?

Another Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: To put the rice?

Sahaja Yogi: Rice is on.

Shri Mataji: And what I have given should be put in a..., in a (small serving). It is all right if the rice is very hot. Rice is ready?
Sahaja Yogi: Nearly ready.

Shri Mataji: But see that it is cooked well, otherwise...Ask Bill to look at it. Ask him to cook it well. See that’s very important.

It’s here (catch on seeker’s back). Now give up all that. Give up all the drugs. You can. Have you reduced it now? Since you met Me?

[Seeker is nodding yes].

All right. You can give up overnight. Just put a little willpower. Right side is your willpower. Which is out of gear.

How is this lady? Ask her to open her eyes. It’s on the Vishuddhi, what the problem is. Ask her to take out the cross for a while. Rosary. Just for a while.

All you all right, My child? Better? Did you feel?

No? Now we should see. You should feel it, why not?

What’s that? Are you better? No.

Sahaja Yogi: Can you take a look at her?

Shri Mataji: I will see. All right?

Are you better?

Seeker: [UNCLEAR/nodding yes].

Shri Mataji: Yes. Yes.

Are you all right? All right, I will see.

This is the place. All right? It’s your willpower. It’s finished.

Now you must have a willpower because you have to live more and you have to enjoy your spirit and you have to give the enjoyment to others, the enjoyment, all right? You have a purpose now.

Right to the left. Right to the left (for another seeker).

No, you are all right. I will work that out. Are you feeling the cool breeze? It’s all right, put your hand on the sciatica on the back.

Ah, that’s all. You can put your hand towards Me. You can cure yourself. Yes, of course, you can. That’s the minimum.

Are you all right? Just don’t go into thinking. Be alert. Be alert.

Seeker: Mother, I think I am starting to feel the cool breeze. When I was in my teens, you see I took drugs.

Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Everything will be cleared. It’s like a flood. Don’t worry. Don’t worry about your past. Just don’t worry.

That doesn’t exist for Me. You just go on thinking about what wrong you have done. Forget it. I told you a hundred times to forget it. Let Me look after you. Actually, I don’t want to know about it. All right?

But some were still very worried, so I said write to Me. They wrote and I never read any. Burnt them off. What to do? How to convince them that...

Seeker: What I can do about my high blood pressure?

Shri Mataji: No, no that will be automatically taken over. Don’t you worry. You will be alright. Blood pressure takes no time.

Are you better My child now? All right?

[Shri Mataji gives bandhan to the seeker and raises the Kundalini].

What’s it?

Warren: She's been to Muktananda. Why don't you just say. I said, “Please forgive me for going to him and give me my Self-realisation”. She said it and straight away she felt it.

Shri Mataji: Really? Better try. Say that. Come along. Let’s see. Mother, forgive me. Tell them. These two.

[Warren speaks to the seekers].

Shri Mataji: Better?

Seeker: I don’t know.

Shri Mataji: Touch your hand yourself. No, see the pain. Still there? Where? Wherever is the pain you put your hand. Just you put your hand.

(To seeker being worked on): Better now? You have got every kind of a drug in your body, is it? Left, right both sides.

They are so particular in customs; we saw. Went round every bit of it, even pencils and fountain pens they opened out to see the drugs. I don’t know how they penetrate. Yes, despite all that effort. You must help the police to find them out. Really.

These are all anti-God things.

Yes, I came out because I have a diplomatic passport. They didn’t bother Me at all. But these people were held up for about an hour. They went thoroughly into everything. Every bit of it. Even a pencil, a sharpener every bit of it was opened out completely by them. Such a thorough examination.

Warren: [UNCLEAR] any problem?

Shri Mataji: Better now?

Ask for forgiveness. You too ask for forgiveness. For going to this horrible fellow.

Take a chair. I think you will be better off.

Are you all right now, My child? You are all right, I think you are better now? May God Bless You.

Let’s see. May God Bless You. Now see if you feel the cool breeze. It is looking better.

Now, who else? Sciatica. Come along.

Turn around. Left side? Is it more on the left side?

Seeker: It's on the left, yes.

Shri Mataji: Just sit down with your stretched legs here. Stretch your legs. Let’s see. Here.

I have done medicine for the same reason. All right? To know the names, what you call them.

How, how are you, My child? Felt it? Good.

Are you all right? What is it? You feel the pull in the muscle? I see.

(To seeker in front): You are better. Isn’t it? It is flowing down there.

Good. But don’t do too strenuous exercise. For the time being. You can walk at the most.

Be careful

When you have your bath. Just wipe out yourself. You see, that is the thing - you leave yourself open and you catch this as a cold thing. It is melting. It is all right.

What’s the matter? Is she all right?

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR/liver].

Shri Mataji: Got a liver? All right. Come on the Mother Earth. The best to cure your liver all right?

Just sit on Her, put your left hand on the right side of your stomach. Lower, little lower, little lower. Just a little higher. Little high. Under the ribs. All right. Now push it hard and put your hand on the Mother Earth. Right hand.

(To seeker being worked on): You are cleared out. All right? Cleared out. May God Bless You.

(To someone): So sweet of you. May God Bless You. Thank you very much. Thank you. Are you going now?

Seeker: This is my friend. Can you do something for her now?

Shri Mataji: Whom? She’s all right now. She’s all right. She’s all right. May God Bless You. Thank you very much.

[A seeker is referred to Shri Mataji].

Shri Mataji: All right. Come along. What work do you do?

Seeker:  I'm in the bank. And I have (spinal) traction once a week. I've had that [UNCLEAR] twisted spine.

Shri Mataji: All right. Now put your hand towards Me. Right one. This one on the stomach. Lower. Little bit.

You just say, “Mother, are you the source of all the banks?”.

[Seeker repeats].

Shri Mataji: Again. Again.

[Seeker repeats].
Shri Mataji: All right? It’s working out. And the pain? All right. Come along. Sit down.

You see, in the bank, we are just cashiers aren’t we? We don’t do anything. We don’t own it, do we?

Seeker: Exactly.

Shri Mataji: Did you fix his right Vishuddhi?

Warren: Which one, Mother?

Shri Mataji: This one.

Warren: He’s got a total spine problem. From top to bottom. And I...he’s a major problem from early, what is it, curvature?

Shri Mataji: Can you go forward a little bit?

Seeker: I don’t know exactly.

Shri Mataji: It’s left Swadishthana. Have you been to anyone?

Seeker: [UNCLEAR].

Warren: Who have you been to? Any spiritual seeking?

Seeker: No, nothing like that.

Warren: No, but who, what sort of seeking?

Seeker: I am a Catholic.

Warren: You are a Catholic. He is Catholic.

Shri Mataji: All right, let him ask the question of the Holy Ghost then.

Warren: Turn around and face Mother. And ask Her...

Shri Mataji: Put your left hand towards Me. And right hand on the Mother Earth. On Mother Earth. Now ask a question.

Warren: Ask the question - “Mother, are you incarnation of the Holy Ghost?”.

Seeker: Are you incarnation of the Holy Ghost?

[UNCLEAR/cool breeze].

Shri Mataji: Ask the question, “Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”.

[Seeker repeats].

Shri Mataji: All right. It’s more physical. Just turn around.

Warren: Did you feel that cool?

Shri Mataji: Yes he did. Just move further. All Nabhi see. He’s got it on the Nabhi. He’s catching very badly. All Nabhi.

(To someone): Now, what have you got? (Laughing). To begin with, this?

Warren: [UNCLEAR/sure the Nabhi is there].

Little boy’s got diabetes.

Shri Mataji: What’s it?

Warren: Diabetes.

Shri Mataji: Diabetes? Come along. Come here. Take out their shoes. Please take out their shoes. Both?

Warren: Just take their shoes off.

Shri Mataji: Take out your shoes, please. Very bad Nabhi he has got.

Warren: Sit down, just sit down. That’s it.

Shri Mataji: No, towards Me.

Warren: Turn your tummy towards...A bit closer.

[Warren is telling the parents to develop their vibrations and bring the child regularly].

Shri Mataji: Did you feel the cool breeze, these two ladies? Good.

(To the parent): Did you feel the cool breeze yourself? Good now. Are you feeling peaceful now? Better. Put your right hand on your spleen yourself.

Shri Mataji: She’s more on the spleen, he’s more on the...

Warren: She’s on the spleen, he is on the pancreas.

Shri Mataji: Better sir? Are you?

Warren: Is it easing?

Seeker: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: First of all, to ease out this centre is very bad you see, than that one. Now push back, My foot. That’s good.

Are you feeling there?

Seeker: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Little hot?

Seeker: Yes.

Shri Mataji: How are you feeling now, this lady? Are you feeling better now? Good, good. Better. And in the hands?

Seeker: I am still very hot.

Shri Mataji: Now what you do is put left hand like that (upward).

Is she better? She’s all right. She’s all right. She’s very good I should say.

Warren: She’s clearing nicely.

Shri Mataji: You should get her some olive oil or something to put in the head.

Warren: She’s having acupuncture at the moment, Mother. She should stop it.

[Shri Mataji gasps].

Shri Mataji: No acupuncture. No need. You did too?

Seeker: Four times.

Shri Mataji: Are you all right now?

Seeker: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji (to seeker being worked on): Better now?

Seeker: It is easing now.

Shri Mataji: Easing now. It will melt away. How are you? Terrible.

Warren (to seeker): Is it always on the left side?

[Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers one or two times quickly].

Warren: Left Swadishthana.

Shri Mataji: Is there any Sahaja Yogi here? Available?

Warren: Who would you like Mother?

Shri Mataji: Anyone. Get some ice for Me.

Warren: He’s better now. [UNCLEAR/cure him].

[Shri Mataji is bending down to work on the back of the seeker].

Shri Mataji: Right heart. Where is your father?

Seeker: [UNCLEAR].

[Warren speaks to the seeker].

Warren: Incapacitated? He was in an accident nine years ago. Where is he now? How is your relationship with him?

[Break in recording. When it resumes the recording is from the kitchen in the ashram. Shri Mataji is in the kitchen with an apron on and talking to the Sahaja Yogis in English and Hindi].

Shri Mataji: Where is it? Have you kept the masala?

Sahaja Yogini: Masala? I don’t know.

Another Sahaja Yogini (holding a packet): Garam masala?

[Shri Mataji is working on the pot on the stove].

Shri Mataji: Mooli (radish) is there?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes. (To someone) Cut that fast and into smaller [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Where is it? [UNCLEAR/do them altogether].

[Shri Mataji is sorting the greens].

This is My profession. I live by that. That’s how I earn My living.

[Shri Mataji is rinsing out greens].

Put that [UNCLEAR]. This will bring about the whole thing.

[Shri Mataji is guiding a Sahaja Yogini who is chopping coriander/cilantro leaves].

Shri Mataji: Kothimbir. Called as kothimbir there (in India).

Sahaja Yogini: I didn’t even know.

Shri Mataji: Hold it with the whole hand.

One more time. It will get clean. In the water.

Sahaja Yogini: I will get the [UNCLEAR/pot/salt] too.

[Shri Mataji is breaking up the dry spices].

Shri Mataji: Cumin seeds must be jeera. What is cumin seed? Yes, bring that here.

This can be done in the blender? Can you make smaller pieces in the blender?

[Sahaja Yoginis are getting a blender].

Shri Mataji: They are very some of these plates. They are old, aren’t they? You can’t get these nowadays.

[Shri Mataji is mixing the spices].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR/cardamom]. I am sorry we are using quite a lot of this. [UNCLEAR/nice smell]. And the coriander.

Remove this [coriander].

[Shri Mataji is taking out the coriander. Sahaja Yogini brings saffron].

Shri Mataji: Is this saffron?

Sahaja Yogini: I am sorry Mother but I don’t think it’s saffron. Its imitation.

Shri Mataji: Salt? Colour?

[Shri Mataji smells the saffron].

We can use it just to make the colour. They have written it is artificial.

Sahaja Yoginis: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: But the thing is, if it would have been real it would have been better because this gives the colour you see. Saffron.

[UNCLEAR/yellow].
