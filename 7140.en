Conversation with yogis. Melbourne (Australia), 13 March 1983.

Yogi: They are just asking questions, Mother.

Shri Mataji: What kind?

Yogi: Just practical.

Shri Mataji: Practical? That's good, practical questions are very good.

Yogi: Would you like to talk to them for a while?

Shri Mataji: First I talk to them and then ask the questions.

I am overjoyed to see you all here. Actually the whole night I was working on Melbourne seekers, that they should come today and should estabilish their realisation very well.

Now we have to understand few things about Sahaja Yog very clearly and there is no compromise on these few things that we have to accept. Because, as I told you, Truth cannot compromise for you, you have to compromise for Truth.

So the first is that Sahaja Yoga is not just a precept, is not just a precept: it is practice. It is not just a mental idea. Now you got realisation, all right, but it is not sufficient. Even if you think that you got realisation so, now, you are all right, you become the Spirit, all right; but still it is more a mental conception than a real identification.
So it is not that if you get you realisation, and you start the awakening of your Kundalini, starts very well. Still it is to be understood that it is the practice of Sahaja Yoga which is more important of the precept of it.
There are many people in India who can't read or write, who don't have all these mental activities as you have and are not so complicated as you are [Shri Mataji is laughing]; some of them are aboriginal people, just living in the villages, very simple people. They get realisation, they feel the joy much faster than the complicated ones will and they just start working on it.
You have to work it out. This is not the compassion that speaks, talks, elaborates and advertises, but it works. Sahaja Yoga is a thing that works, the religion that works. And this is what we must understand first of all, that it is not the talking, it is not the precept that you are a great soul: you have to become.
Not that you are not, you are. But you have to be aware of it. More light has to flow into you.
Definitely you must be something special to get it, no doubt. But you must allow your lamp to be cleared out, cleansed, so that more light is given. And it works wonders for people who honestly want to ascend in spirituality.

As I told you before also that it is a concept tha many people have that Sahaja Yoga cures people. It is not true. It is just as a by-product it may cure you; just as a by-product.
So one must understand the blessing has come to you only because you are a seeker, you have done a lots of good in your past life and this life also and that God has chosen you to be in His Kingdom.
But it cannot be demanding, you cannot demand, you cannot demand anything from God, He has to give you, because He knows what you deserve. And He gives you much much much more than what you deserve. I mean, I have seen people who have been in Sahaja Yoga that after one year they start asking, "Mother, what did we do to deserve all this?". They just can't believe it. I said, "Must be something, you must know there must be something that the blessings have come to you".

This is one thing that one has to understand that you cannot make Sahaja Yoga compromise for you, you have to understand all the techniques and things about Sahaja Yoga.
Now the thing could be that you may start doubting, you see, so that's what we have people who are doubting about it and doing all kinds of things; you see, in the beginning, they are rather slow movers. So we have to sort them out to begin with, because the second stage of awareness is doubtless awareness: you are doubtless about yourself, doubtless about the working of Sahaja Yoga, doubtless about God's existence, doubtless about His Laws. You become absolutely doubtless, not mentally, it's a state, it's a state of your being by which you achieve lots of results and you really become powerful: you can see your compassion so powerful, so discrete, so understanding, so forebearing. And you are amazed of yourself, you really become a saint in the real sense of the word, that you become humble, flowering, beautifully, not taking anything aggressive upon youself; and you are really in the Kingdom of God that you feel that you are looked after, protected, guided, blessed, every moment you walk along.
And that's the state everybody should aspire to reach this doubtless awareness; and unless and until you reach that state, we don't call you sahaja yogi, you may start calling yourself, but that's left to youself. There are not sort of... we do not have sort of certification, or things going on; or we do not give any written certificates to people, nothing of the kind. It is you who have to certify yourself.

So gradually people grow up into beautiful beings. They start having their self esteem fully estabilished, understanding themselves.
But practice of Sahaja Yoga must be done without thinking too much about it. First you just try it, more trying - because if you start doubting, I tell you, your progress will be much less.
So first, just like a scientist, to try to accept one by... there is nothing that has to be done, you do not have to pay Me anything of course, you do not have to do any acrobatics or anything.
But for example a small thing like my photograph, you see, many people say, "Why Your photograph?" So "Use your photograph" I say, if that works out, you see. It is something surprising: that's how people are challenging Me "Why Your photograph?". "Why don't you use yours? I will be very happy, use anybody's"... but doesn't work out, what to do now? It's My photograph that works out, but even if you do not like it, you have to use it - what can I do?
Is as simple like that, you see; but in that I do not gain anything from you, I do not want anything from you, nothing material that you can give Me. But you will enjoy, you will enjoy My love, you will enjoy. It is all for your own enjoyment, everything is done.

And this is a special time we are born in, we have a special responsibility.
Today we had a lady who came, her husband came, and they were saying that "We had a son who was very well equipped and he went to one of the gurus and he got completely ruined."
And this particular guru ne need to be rather careful about, it's this Rajaneesh fellow. His disciples are rather difficult. They come to Sahaja Yoga, all right, but they are very extreme type of people. They come with a great force to Sahaja Yoga, again go back; so all those who have been to Rajaneesh and have taken his initiation, have to be extremely careful.
All of you who have been to gurus must know that they will be again and again attacked. So you need to be rather patient with yourselves as we are with you, and must know that you must assert your will power a little bit, to come up, and shed off all that was screwed into your head... and you paid for it, you see. Forget it. Some time people say that "We have paid for it, so better have it". That's not the way. You'd better through it away. It is horrible, you have bought a snake on your head, on your neck. So just through away all these things that they have put you on.
You all forget it and become your Self, first of all, and become your own guru. Ask your vibrations, develop your vibratory awareness and grow with it.

Some people will find also that their vibrations are not showing very good results, some of you will find that kind of thing. And when you find that your vibrations are not working out in your hands and things, you should not get worried about it. Maybe your Vishuddhi chakra is not all right. There are ways and methods to improve your Vishuddhi chakra, by which you know the exact mantras to be said and how to improve it; and we also vibrated oil and all that, you can apply here. And also there are other methods by which you can improve your sinus. And if you have any problem with the Vishuddhi because of over-smoking or anything, there are so many ways which you can call the Grandmother's medicine, simple simple things which will work it out, should try to clear out.
So whatever centre is not working out, you should get after that and don't worry about the centres that are good because those who are good are good. So we have to look after the centres which are in trouble and try to improve our centres and complete being has to be brought into the balance.

Some people have some centres so badly off that, despite the fact they have all the centres all right, because of one centre, you see, they are in imbalance. So, first thing in Sahaja Yoga is to establish a balance.

Now certain things about morality and all that, I do not want to talk to you; gradually your self will realise what is good for you and bad for you. But in Sahaja Yoga you will be given a proper guidance as to what is to be done, how to lead a life and how to have a normal, good married life, how to have children, how to look after them, how to get to your parents.
So the social side also you can learn very well by which you really feel happy. But the main society that you have is of sahaja yogis. Of course you do not have to cut off from anyone, you do not have to give up anyone. But you grow among sahaja yogis, these are called sajñānas, you see. "Sa-jñāna", the people who are the followers of Truth.
So once you come together, it is a collective happening and it works out more collectively and it helps you much more. But if you say "Individually, Mother, I can do it", it does not work out. In Sahaja Yoga, I have seen, you do not go too far.
You all have to work it together, you have to meet. Luckily, you have a very good ashram here. You all can come and meditate and take a proper health from these people.
God has already blessed this place so much. And when I came to Melbourne, I stayed in a very small little house, with, I think, two bedrooms and some sort of a thing like that. And this time I find a big, huge thing given to you, and they may start here also a nice school for small children here. Your small children can go to that school where they can be looked after well, they won’t have any complications. And everything can be done at a much better level than what you find in the mundane life.

Everything has a meaning, spiritual meaning, everything in life has a meaning! So you should try to find out whatever is good for your ascent and for your nourishing of your spiritual being!

I hope next time when I come, all of you will be great Sahaja Yogis and will be great people! Individually everyone will be working out on many people, and we have to change the face of Melbourne completely!
May God Bless you all.
