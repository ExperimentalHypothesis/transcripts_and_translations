Public Program Day 7 (Declaration: "I am the Holy Ghost"). New York (USA), 30 September 1981.

...Believe that how this people are reborn and crucified Him again. And again and again they are crucifying. The crucifixion is not the message of Christ. That's why I also don't like people to wear the cross, I can't see the cross. He's not, cross of course is very helpful, because if the bad spirits see the cross they run away. But it is a reminder of something which was unbearable.

Because the Mother had all the power, She was Mahalakshmi. He had eleven powers, eleven powers to destroy. You can imagine, He has still those powers. And He had to go through all that without destruction. He saw to it.

Now, people may say, "How was He resurrected?" First of all there were objections to immaculate conception. I mean, they have objection for everything, He was not a human being. He was the Divine Power. I conceived you in my heart. Do you know that? And I put my Kundalini and I put you - from my heart you do it and [I give you out ?]. The way you have got your second birth, in the same way Christ was truly immaculate. But She put Him in the heart and into the uterus down below and She created Him. It's very easy to doubt Him and say things against Him, because He is no more. And the Jews must learn a lesson now. They denied Him once and they have suffered. Now, don't deny Him again. You cannot deny the person, the embodiment of this Divine Power.

Christians may be blown out, with Christians I've tortured you, forget them, they are just the same as you are - fanatics, fanatics, fanatics. Whether they are Christians or they are Muslims so many is the same as any other person. I do not find any difference whatsoever. Dogmatic, ignorant, fanatic. Forget these people, they do not stand for Christ. Christ Himself has said in second chapter of Matthews II., "You'll be calling Me, 'Christ, Christ, I won't recognize you.' Who are thee?" The people who say, "Christ - we are the solicitors of Christ. We are the people who are in charge of Christ." All of these people will be charged. And they will be thrown away in the hell - the way they have managed things about Christ. Some of them are genuine - they don't know that this is artificial, they are genuine in it, but they must get their Realization. They must ask for their real Realization and they must know what is Christ within themselves, they have to awaken this Christ here.

Now, as I was telling you that Christ said that, "You are to be born again." That, "I've to be born in your heart." Now, the heart centre is here as well as here, because the heart is controlled by this centre at the fontanel bone area. And that's what He said that, "You should get your Realization." When He said, "You should be put in the heart." Now, the people of various confessions in your country, went down to India. And they never told that Christ was born who was the Mahavishnu. Because He is already described in the Puranas. That He is the Adhara - He is the One who will be - once awakened - by the Kundalini will suck your Karmas. They never went and told, so the Indians went on with their Karma-theory and these gurus have come here to teach you Karma. It is amazing how you accept all these theories of nonsense. Like they say that, "You have to suffer, because you have done bad Karmas." Then they may say that, "Yes, you can give you a balance, but you go this way or that way and you just keep into balance. If that is so- that you have to go to one extreme and to another extreme, then what are they doing here? Why are they talking? They better should shut up, because they cannot do anything. They cannot give you Realization. They cannot save you from this situation. So, it's better that you suffer. But why do they say you should suffer? Why should they say? Because they want to enjoy your suffering. They want you to suffer, because they enjoy it. So many of these disciples who came from these horrible gurus, who said, "You must have your karmas and you must suffer" told Me that they saw their gurus giggling at them and mocking at them. And they showed Me some of the photographs they had taken of these gurus which shows complete mockery of these stupid disciples who were suffering in their body and suffering in their mind in the presence of these gurus. So they have a double enjoyment - one the money, another is the sadism and third, the greatest of all, that their purpose is to kill you all and to destroy you all, because you are God's men. That they achieve by their falsehood, because you are impressed by their falsehood.

Now, see, if there was any false guru here this hall would be filled, the whole thing would be filled, on the road there would be a jam. But the real guru - I have seen not only here - everywhere it starts very slowly.

Of course, in a place where people are very simple and who are very sensitive it's a different point, but the people in a city specially they are so insensitive to reality and so sensitive to devils that it is surprising, they feel very much at home with the devils and very much lost with the reality. Because you are [in conflict ?]. So you must know that you have to become the reality. You have to become that which is the Spirit, which is not so far, is shining in your central nervous system, in your awareness. And this is the Spirit, is the One, is Christ.

Now, I've spoken before also in the churches, but today for the first time I am speaking about Christ in a church. And that's why I was very happy that at least in this church I would say something that could establish Him and that when people will come here I hope they get their Realization and that something works out here. They get at least awakening, because so many saints are sitting in front of Me, maybe that one day will come in this church, maybe. It may work out that people will get their Realization.

Christ's life was only for three, four years. Nobody allowed Him to live longer than that. Whatever was possible was done, but such stupid people, such stupid people, you could not talk to them. And that's how they killed Him. He could not speak to them any more and that's how His life was finished. But in that small life of His - what a spark it was! What a spark it was!

The way people have behaved towards Him is atrocious, I must say! I must say the apostles themselves because this Matthews and this - he was such an intellectual. Such an intellectual - he would not accept the idea of immaculate conception. Very difficult man - he would argue it out. He said, "If a virgin is going to give the child then everybody is going to say that it's a very, very blasphemous thing, it's a very, very illegitimate thing and it should not be spoken of." Horrible fellow and one better than the other. And when they took up about the spreading of Christianity they took it in such a funny way, because they became supra-conscious people. They started speaking the languages of so many people. That part of Bible is wrong. Where they became not realized - the wind part is all right, but so many people I've seen who come to My program when they come for Realization they feel the wind for a while and immediately they shelled out and become supra-conscious. Now, we'll see what is supra-conscious entry and the subconscious area.

Now you see here there are two buds. These are the two petals, one controls of course the pituitary, that controls the Ego, and the pineal - that controls the Super-Ego.

But this also has a capacity to blow this out this way, and blow this out this way. Supposing you become supra-conscious because you start thinking too much, about - something about the future, what must be the galaxy, we should find out about it and you must find out about the stars and about all these things and about future, about - say - prophecies what else is that is astrology, and all these you see futuristic things. You people are mostly futuristic, you try to plan, and try to - and every plan fails, of course. But this thinking of planning of too much can push this up this side too much. Actually as shown here is this side, but actually when it is placed, it is placed like this. The Ego is placed like this and the Super-Ego is like this. Here we could not show the [pineal gland ?]. So, from the back to this side is the Super-Ego and from here to here is the Ego. Now, this Ego bloats out this way - into this side. And when it bloats out this side it goes into the supra-conscious area. So it comes up this way.

Now, the supra-conscious area gives you visions, hallucinations. LSD does that, LSD does that. When you start seeing from eye of a person, who is a dead person, but a very ambitious person, for example you might get the vision of Hitler. You might get the vision of, say, all these horrible kings who lived here. You might get to see colours. You may see auras. And one has to understand here that these auras are coming to us, because we shift, we disintegrate. [What's wrong over these ?]? That's how we start seeing something else separated from us. To see auras is not a good sign in Sahaja Yoga. If you are seeing auras we have to bring you back to the same position, because you have to be in the present and not in the future. You get disintegrated. For example, if there is a machine, say, which takes the Auras, I was talking to someone, who has done that work of Aura-picturing. Now, before - after Realization you don't get any Auras in a person, cannot getting auras in a person, because it is integrated, completely integrated, but when he is in a mess, you start getting the auras. Like if he has cancer he'll get auras, if he is an alcoholic he'll get auras, that kind will be crazy auras, a normal person may have auras not so much crazy. But Auras you cannot see when the whole thing is integrated. You can see, in a - say, light this - there is no aberration that means it's a good light. If it is aberrations then it is a bad light. All the seven colours of a light has to be concentrated and has to be integrated. If they are prismatic and if they are giving you separately then it is not one integration. And when it is one integration then you cannot see seven lights.

So the person is not integrated.

Now, all these auras come to us, because we are made of seven type of [docus/lokas ?] within us. But the people who are on the right side only believe in the five [docus/lokas ?], they call them koshas, I don't think if I have time for that, but these are the koshas also created by - one is created by the first centre, by the second centre. By the third centre, this is how the [piricle/pericle ???] goes. By the fourth one, then the fifth one and the sixth and the seventh are the things that they do not create auras outside - they create inside near the heart. And these are created near the heart, but as soon as you get your Realization they all become one. They all merge into one and that is the Spirit.

So, as if you can say that the Spirit exists in a prismatic state then you get the auras of seven, but when it becomes integrated that you become one - all the auras become one.

So, integration is the aim of Sahaja Yoga and now, I think, I have told you how you can also go to the sub-conscious area, the same way. The sub-conscious area is on the left-hand side. If you move into collective sub-conscious area, say for example, you can be triggered into cancer. By this triggering you might get heart attacks and things like that, diabetes. Now, many people believe sugar gives you diabetes - it is nonsense. Sugar doesn't give you diabetes. What gives the diabetes is too much thinking. Those who do not think too much never get. Indian farmers never get diabetes - they don't know what disease it is. Because you think too much, you work too much, this center works too much. It has to create food for the brain, it has to replace the brain centres. And these brain centres are to be replaced. For that it creates out of fat the new centres, the evolved cells, like [ a cent ?] here. And because of that work, if it is too much it neglects the other things which it has to work out throughout, one of them is the spleen, another is pancreas. And when it neglects the pancreas you get diabetes. Not by sugar. Of course sugar, because it has to convert it into fat. But if you do not have sugar then it's a double work. If you have sugar it converts it into fat and makes it use the cells for our brain. But if you think too much, then - and you don't take sugar it's a double action. But if you just take sugar and do not think also can be problem, I think, because he has to convert too much of - into fat, you see. So, too much work is given, there is no balance. So, one has to understand that too much sugar is not good, but you must take sugar, because the sugar is needed - and stop your thinking.

How do you stop your thinking? Only by rising above the Agnya Chakra. This is a very, very important point at Agnya that you must know that the thinking stops. Now, the thinking comes to you like this - like a wave. It rises the thought and falls off. Another thought rises and falls off. In between there is a place called as Vilambha. Now, when the thought rises it automatically falls out. You can see the rising of the thought, but not falling off. Now, this space is the place of present. This rises either from the ego or super-ego and goes into the past. But in-between space is the Present. One is the future, one is the past. Now, this place has to increase. When it increases then what happens is that Agnya chakra opens more - and you become thoughtlessly aware. You become thoughtlessly aware, you come in the Present. There is no thought. And thought is the barrier between the creation and ourselves. For example you look at this - say, a beautiful stone that is placed there or anything. You watch it. Now, if you want to think, "Oh, it looks like a man, it looks like a devil or it looks like a God" or whatever it is. There is a thought you've put in. So, what you do when you are realized you just watch - you watch. And whatever the joy is put there of the creator, of an artist, completely is within you, because there is no thought. There is no wave, there is no disturbance in a completely silent lake. All that is around it, all that creation comes into it, absolutely reflected and you enjoy it in thoughtless awareness - called as Nirvichara Samadhi. There is complete Nirvichara, where you have no thought and you start enjoying that creation - complete the joy of that is there, nothing is left. So, the thoughtless awareness comes in when the Kundalini crosses this Agnya chakra. It does double work. First it makes you thoughtlessly aware.

Secondly because the Kundalini, if it has pierced through it pushes it and She fills this with the grace. The grace falls on this. When the grace comes in, you start relaxing, this centres also relax. These centres are in a tension. But when the grace comes in, they go back into normal. So, there is more - sort of - expansion and the thoughtless awareness starts establishing itself at the Agnya chakra.

Now, the mantra of Agnya is the Lord's Prayer. It has got two sides - Ham and Ksham. Ham means "I am" and Ksham means "I forgive". So, if supposing this is catching, you have to say, "I forgive". If there is Ego within us you should say, "I forgive". If there is super-ego within us you should say, "I am! I am!" So, it is Ham and Ksham, is the Bija, is the seed. Is a seed of the prayer - Lord's Prayer.

Now, there are people who are talking the Lord's Prayer is not all right. I mean, who are you, what do you know about it? Everybody is telling Me, every one. What do you know? What is your authority? The trouble is everybody is entitled to do what they like with religion and with God. Though they do not know anything about it, they are absolutely ignorant but they think they have a right. Because there is no political control over it. Even Hitler can talk about Christ, anybody can talk about Him.

And about the Prayer that He taught you, who are you to challenge it? Who are you to challenge Him? I can't understand how do you challenge a person without knowing your own position and relation to Him?

But this is a very, very common thing that people do and is due to ego. Ego makes you high-handed. And this is the worst type of high-handedness that you challenge God, you challenge Christ, you challenge everything which you don't understand. Your mind is limited. It's a very limited [way/vision. UNCLEAR ?] You cannot do anything with this mind of yours. You have to go beyond it. Somebody has to trigger you into this state, you have to go into there. You have to become the Spirit, only by realizing your Spirit you can get connected with God. And before that you cannot connect it. That's why you have to become the Spirit. And the Spirit is the connection - is the link with God.

There is no other way you can be linked with God. If you want to keep yourself in delusion you go ahead with it. But this is the real thing I'm telling you, it's the true thing I'm telling you, for which you should know, you cannot pay, you cannot purchase it, you cannot demand it and you cannot work it out. The grace of God has to come, fall upon you to do it, or a person who is enlightened can only enlighten you.

Now, about Christ, if I have to speak. I've spoken once on Christ for seven days, one after the other. There's no end to it. He is such a great incarnation - that I just do not know how to say that - I've spoken all about it. As it is we have many tapes in London, you can send for it. We are now going to have a centre here. Herman has offered his place. And we will be sending those tapes there, at least 300 tapes you have got in London, which you can listen to, and see for yourself. And all of these tapes are very good, because they are actually mantras. They work out the mantras and you also get - listening to them - opening of your centres and all that.

Now, the last one which is embarrassing, because she already has told you that, I'm supposed to have been here at least. It is the integration. The end of it is the integration of all this seven centres. All these seven centres are placed around this area called as the Limbic. This is the Limbic Area. Now, if you cut it - the brain - like this transfer section of the brain you'll find it - it's like a lotus. You can find it that there in the marking it's like a lotus, opened out. And it's 1000 petals as called, are like this. But the colouring is not all right, you people are so fond of these special colours, so they have used it, but we can say that it's kind of a 1000 petals, it's there. Now it is said in the Bible that, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames." And these are, they appear, they all appear. But these are very large ones and they appear as living, living flames in different colours, starting from one to another and they are 1000 in number.

Now, the doctors argue that, "They cannot be thousand, there have to be 192." I mean, just imagine this foolish people - to argue on that. But they do not know they're 1000 in number, and they are placed here. Not in the limbic area. All the seven centres are surrounded here. Like we have got now, you see, from here, this is the Agnya chakra. Here. Behind it here at the back, just exactly at the back is the Mooladhara. Surrounding it is this Swadhishthana. Surrounding the Mooladhara is the Swadhishthan. If you are catching on Swadhishthana you can feel it in yourself, the heaviness here. If you are catching, say you have diabetes, give an example. Diabetes people get blind after some time. They loose the power of the eyes, because this thing oppresses the optic cloth, which is controlled by the Mooladhara chakra, you call it as Back Agnya, this portion at the back. So, this is the Swadhishthana chakra here at the back. In the centre here you find a bone - that's the Mooladhara and around it is the Swadhishthana chakra. Then here is the Vishuddhi chakra, is the Virata. Is the Vishuddhi chakra here. When you catch cold you'll find you'll have a problem here. But if you apply something here you'll feel better. And this is the Vishuddhi chakra which is related to your throat, this one. Now, if you have problems with collectivity also you might find a big block here.

Now, at the back of it is the Nabhi here, at the back. This Nabhi has a left and a right side as we have shown here. The left Nabhi and the right Nabhi, there are two, left and right Nabhi - I don't know if I have told about that, left and right Nabhi, but, I mean, you can find out from the book that there's left and right Nabhi. So, you have got a left and a right Nabhi. And also, you sometimes feel the Nabhi in here. Some people do feel who have problems with their Gurus and things like that, you see. Then you feel it.

But the whole Void is here. And this Void is called as Ekadesha Rudra. This Void. The whole. It goes like a main round. And this range is very important, because this you get it from the Void. If you go to a bad guru or someone you get this. And this is the one that is of the rider - the rider, the one who has eleven powers of destruction, the one who's going to come to slash out. Then He's not going to give you a counsel - He is not going to redeem you, no Realization. He'll slash out those who are not realised. And He will emancipate the one who are realized. See, that's the last that you don't ask just now. You've some time more to save some more people, because He is not going to question anyone, He is not going to allow you any more time and that will be the time of complete destruction of all the satanic forces. So that is the Ekadesha here. That collects, because all these horrible gurus are here. These are the Ekadeshas. And this is one thing is to be understood that one should get rid of this very easily.

Now, these two children of Rama who were born here. And they are endowed on the Sun and the Moon. The Sun and the Moon both are here. And the sun became - as I told you - Buddha ultimately here and he became the - not ultimately - the Mahavira, there. But when they were on this earth Buddha talked about non-violence and people thought non-violence to chickens, to bugs. These Mahavira people - the Jains, we have got horrible community called Jains in India and they believe in vegetarianism to this extent that they get a Brahmin, pay him money and put him in a hut and bring all the bugs of the village, put those in the hut and the bugs live on that blood. Is a fact, even today they do it. And then they pay some money to the Brahmin, because the bugs are [biting ?].

Now, you just tell Me this kind of a nonsensical vegetarianism. Am I going to give Realization to chickens? Just think of it. Or to the bugs or to the earthworms? You are human beings, you should eat a flesh which is not of a bigger animal than yourself, because that's horrid. But you can eat the flesh of the animals which are smaller than you. There's no harm in eating that and this kind of a nonsensical vegetarianism, "Don't do any harm to the animals", but they don't mind doing this. Jains are the greatest, they are, you see, such... just like suckers. And they don't mind killing people for their money. They don't mind going for - what you call - [ shikars ?], in hunting. And killing anything, but they will not eat a chicken or even the garlic. Now, garlic, as you know, is very good for the heart. But they don't eat garlic. It's very good for the heart, it's very good for people who have got a tendency towards hardening of the arteries, when the circulation is a problem. Is very good to eat that and for cold. Those people who suffer from cold, if they regularly eat a fresh garlic thing in the night, brush their teeth, they'll be much better off. So, while talking about it I would say.

Now, these seven centres are here. Now, at the fontanel bone is the centre of the heart. Now, just imagine, it is at the centre. So, where do I exist? I mean, all of them are seven centres, so I am just like a [ puppet/pauper ?]. But if I am in your heart, I'm here.

So, the key of Sahaja Yoga is that you have to recognize Me. If you cannot recognize Me you cannot progress in Sahaja Yoga, I have to frankly admit it. Because [ he's already behoves UNCLEAR ?] Me, I don't tell this in My first lectures, but I have to say it that, "Please, now recognize Me." As your Mother I would request you to recognize Me. And you don't have to give Me anything, just take things from Me. Just have it yourself. But recognize Me. If you deny Me then this won't open, this will be always troubled.

That's why at the end when you say, "Mother, give me my Realization." Because I have come on this earth to give you Realization. That's My job. It's one of the worst jobs that one can have. (Laughter)

Because it is so difficult with people: to talk to them, to tell them about it, and they are all the time up in arms, they are so aggressive and they start fighting. It's a Mother's job. It is a thankless job, absolutely thankless job. I have to do it. And also only Mother can do it. Because if you have Christ - he would have taken those eleven things and finished off everyone. If you had asked Krishna He had also some [ how rushed up people and ?] killed. But to use the whole thing with integrated idea and balancing, with understanding human beings you have to have a Mother. And that's why sometimes people try to become very familiar and start taking advantage or taking liberties, which is a wrong thing.

Whatever I am I am and I'm Love - I can't help it. I really can't help it. I'm Compassion. One day I did feel very disgusted, really. Once I did feel very disgusted with people the way they were and I was just saying that, "Forget it!" And then suddenly I saw My photograph and I saw My eyes, then I said, "Nirmala, you are Compassion, you're Compassion, you can't help it. You just can't help it. I have to work it out." I know it means, it means sometimes too much, too much, but I have to work it out.

Now, some people come out with a question, "Why You, Mother?" I said, "Why not you, it's a good idea! Come along, and do it!" (Laughter) It will be the best for Me to retire, My husband might give you a pension for it, he will so happy that I've found out somebody who will replace Me. But I have not yet found out somebody who will replace Me, I wish you could, will be a good idea.

Now, the name Nirmala itself is, means Immaculate. Means, the one who is the cleansing power. Is a name of the Goddess also. My, actually sign name is Lalita, is the name of the Primordial Mother - that is the name of the Primordial Mother. But to be a human being with all these centres around you working, for example for the last three days you don't know how much I am vibrating, you can ask Warren and other people, I asked them to take the vibrations and they were doing like this, where they couldn't touch Me. The tried to put the hand on the head and they were just - they didn't know how to touch Me, even it is so much vibrating. So, it's not easy to carry with all this load on this human body, appear like a human being, to act like a human being, to behave like a human being, so that there is a report - why an incarnation is needed - there has to be a report, because the unconscious cannot talk to you, whatever you see in a dream comes back to you afterwards from the subconscious area - all the ideas will be such a mess, such a confusion and you cannot decide anything. So, it has to come on this earth as a human being and tell you with a language. I never knew English all My life. So, first time I learnt English, but still I don't know American English. I hope I'll be able to learn something more when I travel around and it's a thing that - it's God's desire that you have to be realized. It's all written in the Bible, it's all written in all the books of the scriptures. It is very largely written in the books of Adi Shankaracharya. Who has described Me fully, in a very full way. And it's easy for Indians to get to Me. I mean, though I have not much disciples in the cities, but they are aware of My Advent and they know that I am there. Most of them know about it. But they can't understand why I have come to America. They say that, "Why you come here? People here won't accept it." But I don't think so, because I think you are great seekers, very great seekers, born seekers - you are a special type. I have to work for you. I must say the transformation that has taken place in the western Sahaja Yogis has not been achieved by Indians so much. Though they have an advantage because they are born in a country which has basis, which keeps the attention intact. The attention is very much intact. So, it is easy to work it out there - here it is difficult, it doesn't appeal to people, but still, you are all great people, so many of you are lost, but they can be all saved. But those who are here should know that you have the greatest opportunity in your life today to be realized and to give Realization to others. First of all you have to become all right. Then you can give light to others.

Now, the greatest thing that is needed for Sahaja Yoga is wisdom. And logically you will reach at a conclusion and understand that Sahaja Yoga is the end of all the problems of the world. Of all the problems of the world. For example take the capitalism and communism. Now, I am a capitalist, because I have all the powers and I am the communist, because I cannot enjoy it without giving it to you. But it's spontaneous I have not to do it, because I think about it, it just works. It is like that. All the problems: political problems, economic problems - everything can be solved. Krishna has said, "Yoga Kshema Vahamyam" "When you get your Yoga you get your well-being." He has promised. He could have said it, "Kshema Yoga Vahamyam." He did not, he said, "Yoga Kshema Vahamyam" First do yoga, first unite. Unite with the Spirit then you are blessed by all these things. This is the centre of even material wealth, of Lakshmi, which works out. And all the Sahaja Yogis who have been to Me are blessed by material wealth also, but not too much like Mister Ford - that's an extreme case, that's a headache, but they get well-being from every angle in a balanced way and integrated way. So the last method is of integration - that you get completely integrated. Whatever you do your heart supports it, your mind supports it and your body supports it. You're completely integrated in one being - that is your Spirit.

May God bless you all!

So, now this is the last lecture and I am going to Philadelphia and you pray that Philadelphia people get Realization more and we get more people into Sahaja Yog and that they become enlightened. Then I'll be going to Houston, then to Los Angeles and Vancouver for a day. If you have any friends or relatives there you can write to them, take the address so that they contact and they come down to the program.

May God bless you all!

Normally I don't tell about Myself, but today he exposed Me as soon as I came I had to tell, because it's not tactful. It's not tactful to say anything. It's better that you discover Me than I tell you, because Christ was crucified, everybody was tortured. I do not want to hamper My work, because it makes no difference by telling you anything before Realization. It's better to tell you after Realization that, "I am the Holy Ghost - no doubt. I am the one about which Christ has talked."

I have told them, I had never said this on - from a platform and I told - they have been telling Me, "Mother, You must say that once." I said, "In America I'll declare it."
So, today I declare that, "I am the Holy Ghost, I am the Holy Spirit, who has incarnated on this earth for your Realization."

May God bless you!

Now, any questions?

Sahaja Yogi: "Mother, I just like to say, 'I love You!' "

Sahaja Yogi: "How can I still my thoughts?"

Shri Mataji: "You just say Lord's Prayer. Now, before My photograph. All right? It will work out. Lord's Prayer is the entry, it's the entry, no doubt!"

Shri Mataji: "And at Herman's place. Herman, can you stand up? I'm going to see his place tomorrow."

Sahaja Yogini: "You mentioned on the right side the super-ego, on he right side of the brain."

Shri Mataji: "No, I mean in the sense that it moves like this, you see? And like this, now, this way. But more it goes to the right side, it presses more on the right side. When the movement is like, you see, the thing is, the division is like this, all right?"

Sahaja Yogini: "What sort of thinking would increase the activity on this side? Would increase the super-ego?"

Shri Mataji: "What sort of thinking.

Sahaja Yogini: "Is it too much thinking?"

Shri Mataji: "Now, you don't think now. You see, it's the whole thing. You have to become thoughtlessly aware, first of all, don't think. But once you are realized, once you are realized, whatever you think happens. Whatever you want happens, because your attention is enlightened. Your attention is enlightened.

Like I went to Orleans. There was a lady who was suffering from breast-cancer. And I cured her, she was all right. And I was then in Switzerland, recently - about after a year and somebody came from Orleans - Robert - and he told Me that, "Mother, she is all right." And she is a Sahaja Yogini, but now she has got terrible trouble in her kidney and she's got terrible pain and she's in the hospital. And as soon as he told Me, the pain stopped and the stone came out. And since that day she's all right. So, it just works that moment. Whatever you ask for, it will work, whatever you want for, it will work, because you become collectively conscious and the collective being helps you. Apart from that all the angels - like Saint Michael, who resides on this side, - His birthday was day before yesterday, - the Saint Michael works out, this left side here. And Saint Gabriel is on the right hand side. And all their armies are with you, they all look after you. For example, a realized soul, established realized soul is travelling by a train there will not be an accident. If there is an accident all will be saved. They are saved in such miraculous manners. I mean, the thousand and one things you will see that you'll be amazed how you are helped. So, you don't think, leave it to God. Let His things work."

Sahaja Yogi: "How do you know whether somebody is a realized soul, is a true teacher?"

Shri Mataji: "You see, unless and until you are your Spirit you cannot. You have to become your Spirit. Then you get your vibratory awareness. You get the cool breeze coming in. Now, this cool breeze is nothing but is the all pervading power, which you start feeling on your - you've come for the first time? That's fine. The question is justified, but I've told about it. Then you start feeling the All-pervading power, all right? Then you can also feel whether a person is realized or not. But if you are not the Spirit you cannot. Even logically, for a person, who is a realized soul, devil can't take anything from you. He cannot be at the ascent. He doesn't live by your own. Such a person - it's all right - you can pay for this hall - all right. You can pay for the travelling of the person, it's all right. But you cannot live on the money of other people."
