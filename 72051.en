Few lively moments with Shri Mataji at Pratishthan

Today (25th Nov, Wednesday) for the first time since Her holy arrival of Shri Mataji in Pune, the inmates of Pratishthan along with the family members of Shri Mataji witnessed and shared a few very lively and memorable moments with Shri Mataji.

One was blessed to witness very rare, joyous and intimate moments with the youngest family member Tarini (grand daughter of Kalpana didi and great grand daughter of Shri Mataji) and Shri Mataji. Overflowing expressions of love and compassion from Mother could tangibly be felt.

A few tender moments could also be seen as Tarini stretched herself before Shri Mataji in perfect posture, lying down on the floor to pay respect to the Devi Mother- her very favorite great grandmother. Shri Mataji could be seen very happy and cheerful as She hugged and kissed Tarini time and again. Fountains of joy flowed across Pratishthan.

We thank You Shri Mataji for blessing us with these rare and memorable moments in Your holy presence.

Mataji.....Mataji......Your face shines like a thousand Suns...... You have given us more than we could ask for...... Bliss and Peace and Harmony.....

Jai Shri Mataji
