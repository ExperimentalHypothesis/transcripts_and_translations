Sahaja Yogi: This is the recording of the advice given by Her Holiness Shri Mataji on the occasion of three days seminar held at Cowasji Jehangir Hall [Mumbai] from 19 to 21st March 1976. This is a recording of the first day that is of the 19th March 1976.

Shri Mataji: After a very long time, we are again assembled in this hall. When Sahaja Yoga was just in its infancy, we had arranged a program in this hall. Since then, by God’s grace, Sahaja Yoga has settled, in the minds of the Sahaja Yogis. As if the rain has been absorbed by the hungry Earth.

Sahaja Yoga is not meant for people who are superficial and are not seeking within themselves and with all the earnestness and the hankering of all seekers.

It is not meant for people who are seeking God in the books. Because God is not there.

It is also not meant for people who think they can achieve God. That they can by their efforts, by their extreme ‘hatha‘ as we call it, ‘obstinacy’, win the grace of God.

It is meant for those people who are, from the heart, all the time asking for Him. And looking for Him, for the genuine and for the reality.

‘Sahaja’ – I have told you many a time, ‘saha’ means ‘within’ and ‘ja’ means ‘born with you’. I have elaborately told you many a time what is ‘sahaja‘. It is a ‘spontaneous’ growth of your being into that infinite realm of God’s grace. We have to enter into the Kingdom of God. Not by words, not by deeds, but it has to be the actualisation of the experience.

If you are satisfied by the tomfoolery and the spiritual jugglery that is going on, it is better that you take to that course and be lost. But for Sahaja, you have to be an earnest and genuine seeker. Whatever mistakes you have committed in your search will be forgiven by God, because He knows that it was in ignorance that all these mistakes were committed.

We have here some Sahaja Yogis who know this. But when I see people, and I have experience of them, I am sometimes surprised the way they are contradictory to themselves. How they live with those contradictory ideas; it is something beyond the imagination of God Almighty also.

It has been since ages, one simple question, “How to reach the Infinite, through this finite mind, through this rationality which God has given us.” This is the eternal problem which has been there from the times of Socrates, Confucius, Kant, Hegel. All these great philosophers have been only asking this question in all their findings and searches, “How to reach the Infinite through this finite?”

As it is, the human being is made that way, that he has to worry for himself and also worry about God’s knowing. He is also worried about how God is going to give him this blessing.

Who has created you? Who has created this Universe? Who has created this beautiful heaven for you here?

But you are worried how He is going to give you that blessing by which you will know the heaven within yourself. You are worried how He is going to bestow upon you the bliss of self-knowledge. You need not worry. It is His job. But He has made you like this. He has made you this way, especially, with a purpose.

The articulation of your personality came into being. Just like any egg develops a shell around itself to grow, in the same way, you also develop a shell in which you have to develop your personality, your being in such a manner that ultimately you become the proper instrument to receive that knowledge that is God, that is Divine. And then to emit it to others. And to see it. To be aware of it. To be a Sakshi. To be a witness. Of that Divine flowing through you.

Of course, some of these philosophers never had any inkling of that Divine. Some of them did have; that is why there is such a disparity to what they say. But then have been really genuine people, most of them. And they have been honest about not finding it or finding it.

But today, it is the worst time of hypocrisy, known as Kali Yuga, in which every Dick, Tom, Harry has started claiming that he is the person who is going to introduce you to Him. And he has formed his own ideas and his own imagination to give you that, this is how you are going to receive Him, “I have got it, all right.”

There is one good thing about Kali Yuga I think – that all the ancient scriptures are for you written down a long time back. And you have to tally. If it is the Bible, it is there. If it is Koran, it is there. And if it is anyone of the Vedas, it is there.

But when you start your new scriptures and new ideologies and try to fit in everything according to that, when you try to mould God into your own sorts of weaknesses, then how can you be sahaj, spontaneous?

So, the problem today is Kali Yuga. Is much worse than it was ever before. Because apart from the original articulation we have had, we have many more articulations on us. The worst of all is the mental articulation, that we think by reading books, by talking about it, by giving lectures and receiving lectures, you are going to achieve it. You are sadly mistaken. This is the greatest maya or illusion, I think, of the present.

Other mayas can be conquered, but this is one of the most elusive temptations for the modern man, that he thinks by reading, by listening about God, he is going to achieve. It is spontaneous.

Let us understand what is spontaneous. Spontaneous is a natural, living thing that happens to us. For example, if you see a seed – if you plant it, it spontaneously grows. Do you stand on your head in front of that seed? Or do you read books? Or does the seed have to read books of germination, to get germinated? Not that. Never! But it is only a human being who thinks foolishly, which an ordinary dog also does not do that.

You may say that; there are books which are Truth, there are books which are pouring reality. But have you got the measure to know which are the books which are pouring reality, and which are not?

There are gurus, who are of course prospering materially better because they tell you to take sanyasa, “You take sanyasa, you renounce and bring all the money to me”. And foolishly so many human beings are attached and attracted towards such people. Why? Because our articulation has given way to this darkness that we go to something false much faster than to reality.

We are shaken up within ourselves. We do not have the strength to hold onto the reality, to ask for the reality. They have to give us reality!

So, anybody who speaks, you see, in a bombastic manner, quotations over quotations, reading this, reading that, giving big lectures; people are very much fascinated.

They think by listening to lectures, you are going to have it.

Never, never.

It is going to happen to you. You have been to so many lectures before. You have listened to so many people. There have been many gurus – good and bad. Have you been able to make out who is a real guru and who is not? How will you know that this man is talking from the seventh heaven? It may be a rakshasa, talking to you. It may be a devil incarnated in these horrible days. He could be anything who is talking to you.

What makes you believe that some person who is behaving like a godman is a real godman or not? There is a way. And that is why, when is more necessary, the things happen by which you know.

You have to become something else to know what is wrong. You have to be reborn. You have to be baptized. You have to become a Brahmin. You have to become a Mussalman. You have to become a Christian. You are to be reborn. You are born with a body; you are born with a mind which is articulated.

You have to jump into that Infinite Love of God to know Who is emitting that Love.

And then the knowledge comes to you. Unless and until your eyes are opened, don’t believe into any personality because he knows how to impress you people, and even not Me, unless and until I give you everything, I give you that which you are seeking.

You must ask for the Reality. Ask for that from Me. I cannot give you anything else but that.

Unless and until you have had that experience, the actualisation of that, of the Sahaja Yoga by which you receive the blessings within yourselves and you feel it and it emits through your extremities. And you see that power flowing through you which is known as the Chaitanya Lahari [Waves of Bliss] which was very well described by Adi Shankaracharya, whom nobody reads these days.

They want to read somebody who talks of sex. The mind is so much attached to sex, that everything must come through sex; otherwise, nothing goes here. These people who try to impress you try to work on your weakness. But a Mother is not going to do that.

A Mother is going to give you the real that is there and is going to tell you that, “My child, this has been wrong and you have to get detached from that idea. And stand within yourselves.” Every one of them, those who have been great, has been saying, “Na yoga, na sankya” [neither yoga nor reasoning] – Shankaracharya’s.

But Hindus are the first who will go to yoga – to hatha yoga. When Shankaracharya never did anyone of these yoga’s. Yoga’s are meant for very, very few people. For very few people who live with a guru, in the jungles. You have to do six things simultaneously under the guidance of an evolved soul. But everybody is trying to do yoga because they want to slim down. God is not to be used for these frivolous things. All right, you do exercises. But this is not yoga.

Yoga means ‘union with God’. It is union with God. It is not union with the worldly things that you think so important.

Those who go to the extremes of things are also no good for Sahaja Yoga. Extreme takes you away from reality which was said by Gautama Buddha. He said, “Take to the middle path, keep to the middle path.” But His disciples have gone to the extreme path. Of foolishness. He said, “Do not worship any Gods or Goddesses at that time”, because He was in sahaja. So, His disciples started worshipping his tooth, nail, everything.

Of course, that too has a meaning. But not for people who are not realised. How can you make out that the hair of Mohammad Saheb is in that place in Kashmir or it is of some imposter? Have you got any method by which you can detect? I can say that it is the hair of Mohammad Saheb. I say that. But why should you accept me also?

With all your brains and intelligence, why should you accept anything which is not actually focused within your awareness? Which is not actually brought within your awareness.

There is a method. There is a way. There is an education. But it is a spontaneous one. It happens to you. You just become. This education comes to you in such a manner, in such a way, that even a child knows. It is a subjective knowledge that comes to you.

When you jump into that Divine Love through Sahaja Yoga, then you become one with the collective consciousness. It is not that I tell you that you are collectively conscious, but you become conscious.

For example, now, for Me, when I say that this sari has got a border, you will say, “Yes of course we know.”

This is a recording Of the advice given by Holiness Mataji on the occasion of three-day seminar held at Kawaji Yongir Hall from 19 to 21st March 1976. This is a recording of the first day, that is of the 19th March 1976. Don't let the After a very long time. We are again assembled in this hall. When Sergio was Just In its infancy. We had arranged a programme in this hall. Since then By God's grace The yoga. Ha In the mind Of the 3iovi. I The rain Has been absorbed. By the hungry earth.

Saha yoga is not man. For people Who are superficial? And not seeking within themselves with all earnestness. And the hankering All for It is not meant for people who are seeking God. In the books Because God is not there. It is also not meant for people who think. They can achieve God. That they can by their efforts. By their extreme Hot as we call it. Obstinacy.

Win the grace of God. It is meant for those people. Who are from the heart all the time asking for him and looking for him for the genuine and for the reality. Sahaja, I have told you many a times. Sahaja means Saha meansanja is born. I've elaborately told you many a times what is the haja. It is a spontaneous growth of your being into that infinite realm of God'sness. We have to enter into the kingdom of God. Not by words, not by deed, but it has to be the actualization of the experience. If you are satisfied.

By the tomfoolery and the spiritual jugglery that is going on, it is better you take to that course and be lost. But for Sahaja, you have to be an earnest and a genuine. Whatever mistakes you have committed. In your search will be forgiven. By God, because he knows that it was in ignorance that all these mistakes. We have here some yogis who know this. But When I see people. And when I have experience of them, I'm sometimes surprised the way they are contradictory to themselves. How they live with those contradictory ideas, it is something beyond the imagination of God Almighty. It has been Since E One simple question.

How to reach the infinite. Through this finite mind, through this rationality which God has given. This is the eternal problem which has been there from the times of Socrates, Confucius. Hegel, all these great Philosophers have been only asking this question in all their findings and search how to reach the infinite through this fine art. As it is, human being is made that way, that he has to worry for himself and worry also about God's doing. He is also worried how God is going to give him this blessing. Who has created you, who has created this universe, who has created this beautiful heaven for you here? But you are worried, how is he going to give you that blessing by which you will know the heaven within yourself. You're worried how he is going to bestow on you. The bliss of self knowledge.

You need not worry. It is his job But he has made you like this. He has made you this way, especially. With a The articulation of your personality came into being. Just like an egg. Develops a shell around itself to grow in the same way you also develop a shell. In which you have to develop your personality, your being in such a manner. That ultimately you become the proper instrument to receive. That knowledge. That is God that is divine.

And then to emit it. To others And to seek it to be aware of that, to be a sash, to be a witness of that divine flowing through you. Of course Some of these philosophers never had any inkling of that device. Some of them did have. That's why there's such a disparity in what they see. But there have been really genuine people, most of them. And they have been honest about them not finding it or finding it. But today is the Worst time of hypocrisy known as Kaliba in which every dictum Harry has started claiming that he is the person who is going to introduce you to him. And he has formed his own ideas and his own. Imagination to give you that this is how you are going to receive it and I have got it already.

There's one thing good about Kalijuga is. That all the ancient scriptures are for you written down a long time back, and you have to tell it. If it is Bible, it is there. If it is Koran, it is there, and if it is one of the Vedars, it is there. But when you start your new scriptures and new ideology, And try to fit in everything according to that. When you try to mould God into your own cups of weaknesses. Then, how can you be Sahajaon thing? So the problem problem today in Kaliba. Is much worse than it was ever before, because apart from the original articulation we have had. We have Many more Articulations on us.

The worst of all is the mental articulation. That we think by reading books, by talking about books, by giving lectures or by receiving it through lectures, we are going to achieve. You are sadly mistaken. This is the greatest Maya or the illusion I think of the present. Other Maya Can be conquered, but this is one of the most elusive temptation for the modern man that he thinks by reading. By listening about God, he is going to achieve. It is a spontaneous. Let us understand what is spontaneous. Spontaneous is natural living thing that happens to us. For example, you see a seed, when you plant it, it spontaneously grows.

Do you stand on your head before that seed, or do you read books, or does the the seed has to read the books of germination to get germinated? Not that Never, but It is only the human beings who think so foolishly, which an ordinary dog also doesn't think that. You may say that There are books which are. There are books which are boring reality. But have you got any measure to know which are the books which are for reality and which are not? There are gurus Who are of course prospering materially better. Because they tell you you take Sanya, you take Sanya, you renounce and bring all the money to me. And foolishly so many human beings are attached and attracted to such people. Why? Because Our articulation has Given us this darkness that we grow up to something that is false much faster than to reality.

We are shaken up within ourselves. We haven't got strength to hold to the reality, to ask for the reality that they have to give us the reality. So anybody who speaks, you see in a bombastic manner, quotations after quotations, reading this, reading that, giving you big lectures, people are very much fascinated. They think by listening to lectures you are going to have never, never. It is going to happen to you. You have been to so many lectures before. You have listened to so many people. There have been many gurus, good and bad. Have you been able to make out who is a real guru and who is not? How did you know?

That this man is talking from the 7th heaven. It may be a Rakshaha talking to you. It may be a devil incarnate in these horrible day. He could be anything who is talking to you. What makes you believe that some person? Who is Behaving like a godman is a real godman or not? There is a way. And that is why when there is more necessity, the things happen by which you know. You have to become something else to know what is. You have to be reborn.

You have to be baptised. You have to become a Brahmin. You have to become a Musalmah. You have to become a Christian. You are to be reborn, you are born with a body, you are born with a mind, which is articulated. You have to jump into that infinite. Love of God. To know who is emitting that love. And then the knowledge comes to you unless and until your eyes are open. Don't believe into any personality because he knows how to impress you.

And even not me. Unless and until I've been able to give you that which you are. You must ask for the reality. Ask for that from me. I cannot give you anything else but that. Unless and until you have had that experience, the actualization of that. Of the sai yoga by which You receive the blessings within yourself and you feel it and it emits through your extremities and you see that power flowing through you, which is known as the Chaitanellahari. Which was very well described by Avi Shankaraja, whom nobody reads these days. They want to reach somebody who talks of sex. The mind is so much attached to sex that everything must come through sex, otherwise nothing goes here.

These people who try to impress you try to work on your weakness. But a mother is not going to do that. A mother is going to give you the real that is there and is going to tell you that my child, this has been wrong and you have to get detached from that idea and stand within yourself. Every one of them, those who have been great, have been saying. The yoga. Chanarra Charez But Hindus are the first who will go to yoga, to hat yoga. When Shankaracharya never did any one of these yoga. Yogas are meant for very, very few people. For very few people who live with a guru. In the jungle You have to do 6 things simultaneously under the guidance of any wars.

But everybody is trying to do yoga because they want to slim down. God is not to be used for this frivolous things. All right, you do exercise is different, but this is no yoga. Yoga means union with God. It is union with God. It is not The union with the worldly things that you think were important. Those who go to the extremes of things. Are also no good for Sahajo. Extreme Takes you Away from reality which was said by Gautam Buddha, he said, take to the many. Keep to the middle part.

But his disciples Have gone to the extreme part. Or foolish He said, Don't worship any gods and goddesses at that time, because he was in Sahaja. So his disciples started worshipping his tooth, nail everything. Of course that too has a meaning, but not for people who are not realised. How can you make out whether the hair or mamaab is in that place in Kashmir or it is of some. Import Have you got any method by which you can detect? I can say it is the hair of Moan. I say that. But why should they accept me also? With all your brains and intelligence, why should you accept anything which is not actually focused within your awareness, which is not brought within your awareness.

There is a method, there is a way, there is an education, but it is a spontaneous. It happens to you, you just become. This education comes to you in such a manner. In such a way That even a child knows. It is a subjective knowledge that comes to me. When you jump into that divine love through Sahajeo. Then you become one. With collective consciousness. It's not that I tell you that you are collectively conscious, but you become conscious. For example, now, for me.

When I say that this sari has got a border, you will say, yes, of course we know we can. But if I say that you are all one bound by one string within yourself. Oh, we have big organisations describing human beings. They are all brothers and sisters. We are all one. We have to be one nation. But this is just conditioning artificial talking about. But If you become a sur yogi, immediately you know that you are one with another because you can feel the other one. It is fantastic, but it is happening and it will happen to you also if this experience dawns upon. What do you feel in collective consciousness?

For example, I put my hand towards someone like this. Immediately I can feel it. What is the problem with the kundalini of that first. That means immediately my fingers will indicate to me because they indicate all the chakras. And immediately I can decode it and say that this is the finger and that's why there's a problem here in the Vishu is an absolute truth has been experimented. But people do not want to see the truth. They want to see some magic. It's an absolute truth. Once you put your hands towards somebody, immediately a Saha Yogi can say that this person is suffering from some throat trouble. And when that person starts Rubbing the hand, the other person feels better.

You can even feel a little lump in the throat here, understanding that another person also has got a problem. This is a fact. This is scientific. If I say something to you, you should just take it as a hypothesis, but if it works in you, then you go ahead with it and see for yourself that these vibrations that are flowing through you, are they not working it out? Luckily in Bombay. Now we have many Savi. Spread out all over the place, who have got vibrations and who have experimented. But there is a university, Rahu University, which is working on. The vegetables and the wheat and when they put this titania. This divine force on the wheat, they found that it was 10 times more.

Than it was normal, it was produced in such a large bulk. They have tried many experiments with this, and they're amazed at the results that these vibrations produce on the vegetable and the food that we eat. Of course they are published also in the papers, but nobody wants to see that our eyes open, want to know about it, the joke. Of this. We have definitely cured people of cancer because it's the control of the parasympathetic that we arrive after realisation. And cancer cannot be cured by anything else but surgical, you take it down today. You cannot cure cancer without surgery. You may just give up some gap. You see some sort of a stopgap arrangement could be done, but you cannot feel. Because through the parasympathetic nervous system, only you can refill your sympathetic nervous system.

It is a fact. And we have cured many cancer patients. There are some doctors who have cured it that are sitting down here. But they are also breaking their heads because these doctors do not want to come and open their eyes because they think their practise will be lost. Just think of that. There was a doctor whom he approached. He was a very well known surgeon. Oh, he was a cardiologist of Bombay. And he, when we approached him, we talked to him, he wouldn't just, you see, listen to us even, and we told him, I told him very frankly that doctor, your own heart is in danger, be careful. He said, how do you know?

I said, I can feel your cardiac flexor and it is absolutely in a mud. But he wouldn't believe that. And he had a very bad heart which was discovered after 3 or 4 months and then he died of heart. Today I read in the papers about cardiologists coming here. Will they ever come and listen to us and know that heart can be cured. Now there is a patient here who was a heart patient has been cured by surgery. Because it is free, it is just flowing. You do not believe in love. You believe in money. If you pay money to someone and if he cures you, you think it is something great because it satisfies your ego.

But if mother says that by love, by this divine love, you can be cured, you will immediately, how can that be? But curing is not the only point. That's not so important. Of course it is a byproduct because when the divine has to come into you, your body is cured. But mentally. You must have heard how many mental cases we have here. All mental stress and strain is due to the tension built up by the sympathetic nervous system. And when Tension is built up. You feel you are very tense. You have got high blood pressure, you have got all kinds of problems, even people are becoming mad now.

Especially in the African country, I find people are very nervous because they have exhausted their sympathetic flow and they have to fill in through the parasite. Despite all that, Despite all that, they will not ask for relaxation. When I say through er, you can immediately get relaxation because Your parasympathetic is filled in. The petrol that was exhausting is again filled in. They will not ask for it. It is most amazing the way human beings are, but supporting tomorrow I take out a ring, diamond ring. Even the people who are supposed to be very rich would be running. After it, haven't they got sufficient rings with them that they're running after rings? I can understand people who have no money. But it is the rich who are running after such people who are giving them rings.

There have been such horrible organisations in our country. It's shameful the way people have been following them. You have heard of them. Some of them are already landed in the gene. All these money making things can only thrive because the human beings themselves are not. Yet ready They are not yet prepared to receive the reality, but if they are not prepared, they may come. When the reality has to express itself, it will destroy all such people. It will have to destroy because it has to come. You have to be tuned in such a manner that you receive that love, but the same love. When you do not accept You'll be thrown out of evolutionary process.

The time is very short, believe me, the time is very short. Within 2 years' time, I have to tell you, things are going to be decided. While people are already Love Thanks to these thugs and these cheats who want to make money. Shamelessly living on other people's money luxuriously. Selling their Artificial enticement. At least If you Very few of them. To take upon themselves that we are going to receive the reality. We are asking for the reality you can save the humanity even today. Sahayoga If you say it is my discovery, I would say it is not. It is the discovery of this age, the discovery of the secret, those who have been hankering for it, those who have been asking for it.

So God says, all right, have it now. But when it comes to have it, they don't want to have it. Like Tulsi Dasa wrote all his Tulsi rama, and when Sri Rama himself appeared before him, he put a tiak on his head, and still he could not recognise who was Tilda. You must understand that God cannot allow his creation to be destroyed. He must have made some provision within you. He must have made some sort of arrangement within you. To enlighten you at a point when there will be completed. This is a time of complete dumbness. At this time the night has to come. How it happens, how it works out.

There is an engineering behind it, no doubt there is. What God has planned into you, how a human being is made, and what has brought out. All these happenings in the Soho yoga. I will be discussing tomorrow. Explaining to you, I have done it many times about Kundalini. But I'll also give you the side effects of Kundalini, the way people have misused the name, the word kundalini, that is your mother. That I will tell you tomorrow. It is no use wasting time in talking. As you all are here, I think it is better that for a short time, if you could go into meditation, let us see if it works out with some options. And tomorrow at 10 o'clock we are having the meditation.

Do come for that. You will not come for meditation today, but after 6 months when I come back from London, then there will be a row of people procuring them. It's something surprising the way we are. There are so many people who might tell that why don't you come for surgery or why don't you get it instead of getting cancer later on and waiting in my house for hours together to get a darshan of matai. What has happened to our brains? If I say that I give you something that is eternal. Which will give you a complete cure and accurity power yourself not only but you can raise the kundalini of others and give realisation to others. It is such a fantastic thing in a bundle I want to give you, but you want to come to my house. For treatment. I told them, Why don't you come to my programme?

They said, No, Mother, we want to get cured. There are so many wrestlers who come to me, Mother, give us peace. Why don't you come to our programme? No, Mother, you give us peace. We command The command gone. You give us this, you do this for us, do that for us. What is your right to do that? How do you command God all the time that you must do this for me, you must do that? Are you connected with Him? Have you entered into his citizenship?

You have not. You have no rights on him, but when you start calling his name Rama Rama Rama Rama, who appears before you is Ramadi. He's a servant. God does not want the homages of clay. Unless and until you are liberated, you have no right on God, but once you are liberated, she comes. He He looks after. He does everything whether he does it or not, you should come and receive it and see for yourself. We see a temple here. We'll say, all right, very good. We must say Namaskar.

If you go to a church, we nicely sing us, Hey, oh, we've been to church on a Sunday. Finished. And then when there is a problem, oh God, please save my mother, she's very sick. Oh God, give job to my husband. Oh God, look after my children. Why? Because you have just said Namaskar leave. But you don't have to do anything. Only thing from your heart, you have to say, oh Lord, shining to me. Give me light, enlighten me.

That's all. You don't have to say anything. It just works like that. But are we that genuine? Is our attention that free? Our attention is lost into so many things. This attention is created, human attention is specially created only to enter into that divine ocean. While our attention is lost into such things. That are absolutely useless. And temporary Which we are not seeking really.

It's a camouflage. We think we are seeking in that we are not. If you are seeking joy and. Then ask for it. You have to just ask for it and you'll have. The time has come. The blossom time has. That's why it is going to work out. Of course, it cannot be a plastic production, but it is going to be a mask. Many people are going to get realisation and have got it, you know, in Bombay there are many people who have got it, but There are very few who have reached a height and they have kept there, but So many of them, they rise and come down.

They rise and come down. They do not settle. You have to steady your boats when you get into it. That is also can be done through Sahadio. So many of you have now done it. You have to do it. That is the time you have to do it after realisation. Before realisation, no religion has any meaning for you. No religious ritual or anything whatsoever, the prayers or anything has any. Help for you.

Actually, very few of those high spirited people, I should say the great people who were born, the evolved people did not know that you are not even a great. They did not know this point because when I read their books, I feel. That just like small children, they have said that you hold the force in your vital force in your heart and raise it. How can you raise it? There is no vital force already awaken. You are not even awaken people. How can you? There is only a inkling of heart. Toward which you are running. But you are not even awaken people.

How can you do the things that they have to? It's so artificial. When you will know through Sajo, you will really feel like laughing at those.
