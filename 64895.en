Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Greece, 23-06-1990

Shri Mataji: May God bless you. Tomorrow again my tour starts. A very nice rest here. So I am here again, going on my tour. [UNCLEAR] was such a nice relief to come here and rest and enjoy your company. May God bless you all.

But you all have to now move out to other countries and try to see that you establish Sahaja Yoga properly. Be kind to them, be nice to them and also there are a positions from other people, no doubt. You have to be very patient with them and try to tell them that you haven't found anything so far, why don't you find out what is the truth. Why don't you find it out? If you are kind to them they might accept your invitation so I hope all of you will take it, responsibly as such to go down and help people. And especially women I think because they are much more free than men are. Men are working. Those who are free can go down and really spread Sahaja Yoga. In any case I'm going back from Ganesha Puja which I hope this time you will have all your acquired reading, all your music readiness, everything in a big way. And you are very good puja at Ganesha Puja this time.

I feel one thing about Sahaja Yogis that there are some Sahaja Yogis who are very active and I find some Sahaja Yogis only come to see Me at the airport, that's all. They are like tourist you see. Just come for receiving at the airport or for something, this is not the way, you must know you have to work for, Sahaja Yoga. If you don't work Sahaja Yoga you cannot progress. It's like one door is open, one window is open but if you don't open other window there cannot be recirculation, there cannot be freshness and you cannot grow. Now I have seen those people who have really learnt any work for Sahaja Yoga have gone all out. Attended all the programs, everything with dedication, have grown very fast. All such people who are just loitering will be very late or very completely discarded or could be that they now have any say in the matter.

So as it is I think it is very important that we should value our self respect, our self knowledge, our Self realisation. I need not tell you this because you know that who got your Self realisation and I feel it you are a bit embarrassed to say this but I've seen this tendency in many people and I am amazed that after getting all these blessings after knowing this is the truth. After knowing that we are born in these important times. After knowing that we are chosen people. After knowing that we have got realisation even then they take it lightly as something like a past-time, it's very wrong.

So what I'm about is that they are about, few people who are really doing work for Sahaja Yoga, running about organising everything. The rest of them are just like visitors and that is a very wrong attitude, very wrong attitude. See there is not by sacrifice in Sahaja Yoga, nobody has to sacrifice anything. On the contrary you are all blessed, thousand times blessed, you've got everything. But what have you done for that? What have you given for that? What have you given for Sahaja Yoga? What have you given for God? His work? What have you done for Him? It has only been one sided thing that we are to receive all the blessings, yeah. I've received [UNCLEAR] ...Somebodies not do this do that. That's all. It's all one sided but why should we not think in our Self respect that what have we done for Sahaja Yoga! What work have we put in? Where are we compared to others? And this I noticed Myself and I wanted to tell you this that I see many people there but there not and therefore I see them but they are not of the same level that so many others are. It is very sad. This is a very great chance of many lives that you endured, you must know yourself first, own your glory. You must know that you are receive the greatest thing in life or other things everybody else has been doing. Collecting money, working, doing this, doing that. Only thing is you to give some time, that's all. Some time has to be given. You don't have to pay, you don't have to go anything extraordinary, you don't have to give up your families or anything. But if your depth is not there then better developed it by telling yourself by developing. Those who have no depth I cannot create, it is inside you but you must touch it. You have not touched your depth. When you touch your depth, you'll just start getting completely dedicated. Why would some people want? Because they have touched their depths. I can see on their chakras, on their faces, I can see very clearly. That some people are extremely deep and some are very shallow, very superficial.

So this - I didn't want to say but [UNCLEAR] noticing these things happening and I felt like I'd better tell you that you have to dedicate yourself, not that you mediate at home and we do. What have we done for Sahaja Yoga? Everyday write it down, what have I done for Sahaja Yoga. Mother has given me Self Realisation. Now, see I'm an old woman, I'm travelling, every night I sleep about two o'clock, get up by four o'clock or five o'clock. Everyday. Travelling everyday. Why should I do that? I don't need Sahaja Yoga, I don't need anything. Do I need anything? Nothing. I have everything. Why am I doing it? Because I feel the love that you need but you should also feel that Mother has given us so much love. So we should give love to others. And our Mother is working so hard, why shouldn't we work? Why shouldn't we do something for Sahaja Yoga? And this is something and this is such a break here. And I think of you people from Austria show the way of over the world. Wherever they are centres it could happen. I hear it from every centre is kind of a complaint that there are very few people who are deep and the rest [UNCLEAR super gross] absolutely useless. Or even if they are something they just come to enjoy Sahaja Yoga, that's all. Nothing else. You give enjoyment to others. How can you enjoy Sahaja Yoga unless and until you enjoy making the company of others who are not yet Sahaja Yogis, you have to give them. They are there waiting for it. So all of you must work it out this way. And there should be no superficial character left in you. Go deep into you. Promise yourself that now Mother has given us these powers, let us use them and work it out. So that's a promise I have come here to take a promise from you. And I hope it is a promise from you, that you will definitely go all out to see and write it, write it everyday. Examine yourself, introspect. What have I done for Sahaja Yoga? That will really help Sahaja Yoga very well. I've seen [UNCLEAR] do so many things and but for some very serious Sahaja Yogis, I could have never have achieved doing it. But people put it much more and the responsibility will be on you people. You could achieve much more if all of you dedicate yourself to this is what. All right. It's a promise.

Sahaja Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: So Goodnight, tomorrow I will be going to India, many are coming with Me I was told. I am very happy for you all.

Yogi: [UNCLEAR]...Show you the video, it's only three minutes.
