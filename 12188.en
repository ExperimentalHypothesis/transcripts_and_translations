Talk to Sahaja Yogis

Then you wont feel the strain, because going back I know what it is to travel. So how was the experience here were you happy— and all the married couples are they happy, you look so nice and so beautiful, now i’ve given quite a big lecture this morning I think and I didn’t talk much about it, but we have to develop personality that’s important. That personality which is of course inside, you are growing very much, but in relationship with that personality, you have to develop a personality which is, dignified, which is impressive, which makes feel, other’s happy, because from you they will judge, if you are frivolous and if you are cheapish type, even because of may be your age whatever it is, still people will start thinking that something wrong with these people. So we have to develop personality, a personality which is inside us, is that of your spirit and that is so dignified, so beautiful and so natural, but naturalness never means frivolity or stupidity it doesn’t means that.
Naturally a human being, even an animal is sensible thing, so human beings are naturally very sensible, very loving, happy, joyous and good creation of God, but it is not yet known to Sahaja Yogi’s that your personality impresses others much more than your talk about Sahaja Yoga. Like Dhumal went a office of collector and the way he was talking, the way he was handling, the way he was so natural and so good and kind, the people in the collector’s office asked him who is your Guru, how you are talking like this, how do you know application so well, how can you solve the problems like this, and he said I have no Guru but one Mother only, they said everyone has Mother. He said. There’s a special Mother I have got, and the whole thing worked out so well that in that collector’s office now. Poor collector doesn’t know how to stand against me because everybody is with me, so that is very important, what sort of personality you are, some of you people look as you are blasted with worries, troubles on your head, as if something terrible has happened and some of you look has if you are not bothered about anything in the world. You are not aware of what is happening in the world, or that you have to do something about it, so to be responsible to be conscious of yourself. Yesterday Shivaji’s lecture was about his own son, he got dejected and he felt depressed and he felt that he has not been able to look after his family people,to put them right and that he failed them and then again he came out, and he said no that’s not the thing. I am here to do a job and my son whatever he has done, he’s done because he’s a frivolous person. He is not the one who is of my time, I’m different type of a person, I’m the one who tried always to become a saviour for the Marathas here and how can I give up, how can I forget it, for one son of mine if he has given up doesn’t matter, so he came up on his own style, he saw for himself, sometime as I told you I also feel little dejected sometimes too, now because I love you so much, and when I find there something very wrong with the people who am I love so much, I Get upset, but then then again start thinking. Oh no. I am Adi Shakti, I can’t be upset. I can not give up just I can’t give up, I have to continue, I have to love them, I have to correct them, I have to look after them and I have to go ahead with it, that’s keeps you alright, that’s what you have to always suggest yourself I’m Sahaja Yogini, I’m Sahaja Yogi how can I feel depressed about it, how can I behave like this, always if you remember you are a Yogi, you are a special type of a person, you are very, very, rare, compared to the population of this world. How many we are very few, very rare, very rare species of people and very rare type of people, we have to be very proud of ourselves and we have to always be very aware that we are this and we are this, and we have to be this and we have to be different.
We shouldn’t worry about people who are not like us, pity them, their fate is sleeping somewhere, something has gone wrong with their fate, they didn’t do good work in their last life perhaps, may be that they are not yet blessed but they are after all, can be they are our relations and they are connected people doesn’t matter. We have to lift them up, somebody has to stand up like Shivaji stood up all his family people were funny, he stood up, he said no I have to do it. In the same way one should not get dissolved or disturbed by anything that’s happening around. You have to dissolve other people, you are not to get dissolved into them, this is what it is and that can come with full confidence in yourself, in Sahaja Yoga and in the love of your Mother.

May God Bless You!

Part2.
Today I would like to announce one thing that I have thought of having two senior Sahaja Yogi leaders like James and Guido, to be selected among us spontaneously, not to any election or anything, to be consulted for anything that you want to be done, instead of consulting me because sometimes it happens that I’m not available, sometimes may be that you don’t feel like talking to me about certain things. So these two persons are there whom you can always contact, ask their advice and they are in charge about all the affairs of the leaders and the people who are around them, and then I can consult them, I can talk to them, they can save out whatever they don’t want to tell me and tell me whatever is to be told to me and what argue the part they want to know, though I know everything. Even if you don’t tell me anything, even if you do it behind seven curtains, of seven countries I know everything. I must say, I just know, and how do I know that I can’t tell you, and I think if you love someone you know everything about that person, but I know about Sahaja Yoga and I know what’s happening where. Nobody should ever believe that somebody told me something against someone, or things like that. If no one can tell me, you see they might tell me, but I don’t listen, they are free to tell me but I know what it is. I know much more then he knows, i’ll give an example, there was an one fellow who was very active and he was trying to help us to have some programmes in the nearby the village. I said that’s a good idea and some of the Sahaja Yogis, local Sahaja Yogis felt that Mother don’t know about this fellow better go and tell him. So they came to me with very serious faces all of them, five or six of them drove on motor cycles came all the way to that guest house, and sat down around it very seriously. Said Mother do you know this fellow is a politician he will play around with you, and he will try to trouble, I said really? they said, yes, they were very seriously, and they said now all the wrong things about that fellow you know that he is capable of a debacle, or he may try to create a problem for Sahaja Yoga, I said that’s all you know? I said alright i’ll tell you what I know about, that this man has a wife, who is not his wife he has eloped with that lady and the child he has got from her, that’s why he is staying there, he is of this caste and his wife is of another caste, all those thing they were just looking. I said have you got more to tell me they took their motor cycles and ran away. So you are not to be afraid of that if somebody is supposed to be a very bad man, or something evil, or any thing like, they are like frogs for me just like a manage them without any difficulty. I just try to do the things in a way that looks human and simple, but I am quite complicated and I can manage thing so well, you won’t even know how I manage, so under these circumstances you must give up all fears that anybody can put something into my head and tell me against somebody, or that my mind can be spoiled against somebody, nothing of the kind, have faith in me, in the system. Now some of you might be wanting, somebody might be wanting, say to marry an Indian or somebody might be wanting to marry an American, whatever was wanting may be. But on vibrations I have judged your couples and I thought this should work out well, but you must co-operative with me, from the very beginning if you start finding faults with another person for small small things, then you are not co-operative, of course nobody is made to order you see, that now this is one person ‘A’, so another is made to order for ‘B’.
Now the eight things that other person should make to order, according to the needs of ‘A’ and the ‘B’ things that the ‘A’ should make to order for the person that is ‘B’. So ‘A &amp; B’ have two thoughts about each other, one wants this kind and another wants that kind, now both are wanting that, that person himself is important and another person has to be complementary, you could be, you could be, if you understand that there’s nothing basically wrong between Sahaja Yogi’s basically alright. There could be little bit differences, there could be little bit disparities, something could be there, has to be. After all God has created this universe with variety to create joy and happiness, supposing if you see only your image in the mirror all the time, not your wife and then you say what is this Mother has married me to myself or what? so that the woman has to be different, the man has to be different, some chance of knowing each other, otherwise if you are exactly replica of yourself you are married, you say i’ve had enough of it now. So one has to agree and accept with joy, happiness and also with curiosity, to know why Mother has married her to me, there must be something, this is how you can make your life much more interesting and happy, you have to learn, you have to learn, you have to see things, seeing is the point, you must see why this has come up, but immediately as soon as you are married you pounce upon each other and try to find faults with each other, that person is like this, that person like this, what is about yourself you see and another person, if you are they tell you the same defect you have, so this habit of giving certificate another to another person is not very good because there’s no end to it, it’s only your mind playing around with you, befouling you. There’s nothing to certify other, now think about me, if I thought like this, first of all I never have come to this earth, because human being you know they have horns, they have funny, funny things with them you see to come among them you don’t know where you will land, it’s not an easy thing to be with human being you know they’re quite funny stuffs, easy to be with dogs, animals you know, where they stand because they have definite temperaments you know, you know the dog will bark, but a human being will bark and shout and kick like a donkey and do anything, because it has passed through many lives of these animals, It has all acquired all the bad qualities, as well as good qualities of those animals, is a bundle of all these things and you don’t know what is the dominant on one person, what is dominant on another, so not easy thing, but I just thought out of curiosity, let’s have a look, may be I might be able to manage and it has worked. In the same fashion if you can look at your married life, I think you can do well don’t take that seriously because my wife’s hair like this, because she was not wearing her spectacles properly or she was clumsy in this way isn’t it, nothing so great, human being is a much bigger thing then all these small little things and that’s how if you can look at other people with that kind of graciousness with that feeling of companionship, we’ll all enjoy each other and also enjoy your wives or your husband whatever may be the case, alright. So now we have appointed two person as the leaders, we should say but I will not call international leaders all that I don’t know what’s goes wrong with that, so now they are to be consulted, then I would say that Engelbert can now take to studies and he has to really study very hard and we will appoint Marcus as the leader for Austria.
Anybody as who wants to give up the leadership just now can suggest Now, who thinks that it is too much because like Engelbert’s case he Has to work very hard, he has to study now, he has to devote his Time and he should not diverted from his work in the same way if ...

Anybody feels that way time comes know and say that and we can Manage, which your marriage, be courageous there’s nothing to worry, Its an adventure, it’s an adventure as you see, if you take aAdventure, if you take.Iwill tell you easiest adventure is to get Married easiest.You don’t have to climb a mountain, you don’t have To cross a river, you don’t have even climb a tree, it is so simple As that,

May God Bless You!
