Public Program. Reading (UK), 15 June 1979.

... [through / to the / It is a] living power, I mean. There are so many more facilities and also capacities to work out that no camera can replace it. And there are so many eyes we have here [when/gained] without any effort, without any money being paid for. Only we realize [UNCLEAR/as human beings] when we have a problem, at that time. In the same way if we have to achieve something higher, if we have to get something more than what we are, if we have to perfect ourselves, the One who has created you, the One who has manifested this human awareness within you is going to do it, and He has to do it because it is His creation and He is going to see to it that He achieves the completion of His [creation]. They were [quite / first] shocked, [country / quite a few] people, when we start talking of God. That is something very, very usual I have seen in people that they do not like people talking about God because they think God is a myth. Now I would say that before we start of, [for instance/nuisance], problems, that are against all dharma, let us first see whatever is said about God. Is it [worth in it/ working out]? Is there [some / common] sense in it? Let's find out that point. If we can find even a little bit of it then maybe we might be able to see the truth.

So first of all it is said that there is God's All-pervading Power which organizes everything, which works out everything and which loves. How many of you can say that they have a catch? Very few. What is the reason we cannot feel that within us or around us? Now, for example, here if I say there are all kinds of pictures around Me which you cannot see. But if you put a television immediately you'll [get / catch] all these pictures. That means you are not the television as yet to see that. But as soon as we put the television it can [catch]. It has a more sensitivity, more capacity to capture that which [is, you see] absolutely people [alone / never known]  cannot see it. In the same way we have to be something more than muddle, to feel that, to understand that. And that's what gives you [this importance / the reason] for our seeking. We do feel we are not perfect. Something is lacking in us. We have to go beyond; it's not sufficient for us to be satisfied. That's how we are seeking. What is that and how we are going to reach there is the second problem which we face. I would say that truth is truth by itself and you cannot conceive it through your own understanding. When you are not in the truth, for example if you are dreaming, then in dreams you cannot think of the truth.

Supposing you are all in a dream, you have to be awakened to know the truth. In a dream you do feel everything being truthful. You think that yes, there's a [UNCLEAR] I see light means all these things are here. But when you are awakened then you know that [you are awake]. In the same way we are in a dream which is just a statement from Me, which I'm the guru for you and for that I'm [UNCLEAR] is that you must keep your minds open and not suddenly jump to any conclusions because you have something against the Divine Power. But just try to feel because this is your right, this is what God has given you that you should manifest that awareness within you by which you can feel the All-pervading Divine Power and this is not going to be denied to anyone who asks for it.

But God is not going to fall at everybody's feet that, "Please ask for it." That is your freedom. That is what you have to ask for. You have to desire it. You cannot give up your freedom nor it will be denied. It is respected. In the same way you cannot take God's [freedom / free will] which doesn't fall at your feet.  I request you to seek it. So now I'm talking about that All-pervading Power which you cannot see. I would say it is like a mirror which is God's reflection of various things. We cannot see the mirror because we stop at the reflections. Our attention is on the reflection â€' that's why we cannot feel the bliss â€' while the mirror is the one that is reflecting and all the reflections are changing. But because our attention is still in that dreamland of reflection we cannot feel that All-pervading Power. So now, is there any method within our being which is being raised by God Almighty? Because if He has created us He must have power which triggers this happening within us by which we become aware of that All-pervading Power.

I say there is a method; there is a special instrument within us which is being placed by God. Through our different stages of evolution He has placed different centers within us which are subtle centers in the spinal chord and there is a [GAIN/gate]. Now these centers do exist within us and if you want to see these centers you can with your own eyes. You can visualize it. You can see, some people, I will show you, when they, we try to raise their Kundalini you'll see that this Kundalini will start pulsating. You can see with your naked eyes that triangular bone. In the triangular bone you can see the Kundalini pulsating and then you can also see the rising of the Kundalini if I tell you. And you can also see the pulsation of these centers in some. This may not be in every person. It may be in some few people this could happen, but not in every person, because if there is an obstruction here and there then only the Kundalini pushes our centers too much, too hard, and that's how you see the pulsation very clearly. But some people have such beautiful centers and such beautiful Kundalini and such beautiful desire that it just rises straight, just like a jet.

You do not see anything and you just become thoughtlessly aware when it crosses the Agnya, this center here. And then when it opens out this part of the head, which we call as Sahasrara or Brahmarandra, here, the opening of the Brahma, there the whole thing becomes as if you have become a holy person, absolutely a holy person. And at that moment you feel cool vibrations flowing within you. This is a happening and an actualization and not a sermoning and a brainwashing. Now say, even if it's My own daughter, if she is not realized, she is not. I cannot say you are realized because it is a happening which happens to every individual and one has to be honest about it, that you cannot guarantee it to anyone. If it will work out well and good, [you won't have] to work hard on him, to pull the Kundalini up. Only the difference is that only those who are realized have got the power to raise the Kundalini. Otherwise any Dick, Tom, Harry [cannot so do it / can also do].

Like, you see, we think that everybody has right to talk about God. Everybody has, you see. Even Napoleon, Hitler, I mean, anyone, they can talk about God. I mean, nobody is going to catch their tongue and say, "How dare you talk about God? What right have you got? What your authority is?" In the same way about Kundalini also everybody talks, you see. Talking is different, raising is absolutely different, is only possible if the person has that authority from the Divine, is the sign of a person who is realized, the one who can raise the Kundalini, who can show you the raising of the Kundalini and can give you Realization. This is the first time a human being is doing a living work. So far what living work have you done? Say if you have painted this, may be, all right, very good, artistic, all right, but is it a living work? We cannot germinate even a small, little seed, even one. But here you'll be germinating the seeds of human beings. And this is a force here which is kept here, you see, very close, awaiting for that happening which is called as Kundalini. She sleeps there in three and a half coils very nicely settled down and She is your Mother, because she gives you your rebirth.

Every individual has an individual Kundalini and your Kundalini is so sweet a Mother, settled down there and like a tape recorder. She's taking down all that you have done in the name of God, in the name of such, even if you are a materialistic person, She knows. She knows everything and while rising you know She indicates what sort of personality you are, what's the problem, what centers are catching. There could be physical problems, there could be mental problems, there could be spiritual problems but She feels so anxious to give you the rebirth that at the first shot Kundalini will rise. And then She settles back again, into these centers and tries to nourish them and bring them right. Now these centers are [so / though] subtle things inside the medullar oblongata. You can see them manifested outside as plexuses, as the doctors call them, by these things.

For example, this center manifests the pelvic plexus which also looks after the sex. Now one has to remember that Kundalini is above; so sex cannot have anything to do with Kundalini. And this, and the deity on this center, is the embodiment of innocence. Say a child who is innocent doesn't understand any sex. That's why He's put down there. Then He incarnates again at this point, as Christ, same personality. Now this one is here at this point where you see My mark is. Inside the brain there is optic chiasm, crosses each other, at that point it is. It controls your pituitary and pineal. Then the another one is this center which moves round your stomach. This one helps manifest our aortic plexus and looks after all the physical organs that are over there, like the liver, a part of liver, say, pancreas, our spleen, and again kidneys. This is the creative center which looks after the creative side. This is the creative side within us.

So if supposing somebody is catching on this center, supposing he is catching on the right hand side, it's definitely he must be an artist. That means he is losing too much of his creativity; he is imbalanced as far as creativity is concerned. Say if he is catching on the other side, on the left hand side Swadisthana, then that means that person has been indulging in some sort of a black magic or is being under the influence of the black magic. Means just the opposite of the creativity which is of mind, in the sense that he has been used, his mental capacities has been used, his emotional capacities have been used for wrong things. And that is how we know when you catch on Swadhishthana that you have this problem.

Mostly people who are possessed, people who have wrong type of gurus, they have this problem; they catch on the left Swadhistana. Or you can see on, here is the palm, onto the palms, you see thumbs indicating. When you are a realized soul you start feeling all these centers are here on your palms. So if you start feeling heat on the right or the left accordingly you will know what is the position of your problem and what is actually wrong with you. Say for a liver patient immediately you catch here, right hand side, means your liver is wrong. A person who is sort of very much all the time thinking, mentally using his capacity to produce something for the future, because right side is for the future. So if you are a big planner and all time you are planning and if the planning has got into you as a habit then these chakras start working very fast and at this stage what happens then the other side is completely neglected. Because of the neglect this side becomes frozen and that's how such people develop diabetes, because of the imbalance.

One side is used too much; another side is not used at all. Like you are, [in the morning], you get up, have a wash, go to the office, come back home, [fight / to wife], work out, then again you go through the next day. You have no value for your wife, or children or anything.  Busy man they'll find [they're] hypertensive. That's what it will take you a little worse. So the nature tries to give you balance. Such people also get heart attacks because the left side being neglected brings you heart attack. So that is to say that in life whatever imbalances come to us are also because of using of this side or that side. And like that all these centers, one by one I cannot tell you today, in such a short time, all these centers show that you have to be in the center.

If you are a temperate person and not in extremes, you keep to the center. At that time, then, the person is absolutely in the center. He is neither too much of on the left or on the right. He is not too much emotional, neither too much mental. Then at that time the Kundalini rises in a proper way. Because when you are on one side, I would say the left and right sympathetic nervous systems, both on the left and the right as you see here working out, when you move too much on one side this is also very dangerous and that's how we develop a, a sort of a disconnection, or it's just, the connection between the two it is lost. When this is lost, it starts working on its own. When it is starting working on its own, now see this center if it starts working on its own it loses its connection to the whole. And that time cancer is settled down. Cancer is not so very old disease. It's a modern disease, cancer is. How it has come to be this cancer? It's because these fifty years we have realized that we have to find something how to evolve. We all are conscious of it, whether we like it or not, but we are all conscious of it that the present life that we are living is nonsense. Because of this consciousness and because of the developing of the ego in us we start understanding that we have been working on something that is not the [aim/purpose/end] of our life or there's something more and that is why the tension you see. Say our forefathers, say three generations back, didn't know what was tension was, what was cancer. This is a very modern stuff, is the tension.

When the tension is built up again the imbalance starts and when the imbalance starts you start moving either to right or to the left. In the beginning it is maybe just a disease or just a little problem here and there but it can develop into anything serious like depending on the centers which are catching. Specially if in this part there is an imbalance then cancer of the stomach is settled. Leukemia, leukemia is just [cancer / this problem] and leukemia can be cured through Sahaja Yoga â€' you'll be amazed â€' but don't bring all the leukemia patients to Me because we need people who are doctors themselves, who themselves are first of all cured and then you can cure leukemia patients. You can see that by giving them a full balance in this area, they can [be] cure[d]. Now these signs of God's own method is absolutely [perfect / purpose]. There cannot be two opinions about it. There cannot be. Like if you go to the doctor, he may say something's wrong with your eyes, he may say something's wrong with your brain, he may say something's wrong with your throat and you just have temperature. So you don't know what to say. I mean, it could be anywhere wrong, anywhere, according to every doctor you come up against. But in Sahaja Yoga when the Realization takes place and the Kundalini pierces through or as I told you when the vibrations start flowing, you don't have any two opinions about it; everybody feels the same. Say you have some children who are realized souls. There are many children in this country who are born realized and they have vibrations. You put ten children together and tie up their eyes and ask them to feel the vibrations and they [all will / always] tell the same thing about the person. There are not two opinions. There cannot be two opinions about it.

And this is how once the vibrations start flowing through you, gradually you start understanding their language. You understand what they mean. The whole decoding is explained to you and you can verify it yourself. For example, somebody comes in, all right. "You, you catch on this". Today only we had a patient and she was catching on this one.  So I asked her, I said, "Where is your father?" She said, "He died suddenly.  I couldn't meet him". Then she came up with the whole problem about her father. She said, "I'm so worried because you see I am catching and he's died," and this and that. And then she told Me the deity she worshipped, find out was the same center right hand side, you see, right side hand side, heart, a center here. And so I asked her, "Why don't you ask your father to leave you alone now and then promise that you are all right and that he should take his rebirth if he likes, but he should not bother about you?" And she felt better. And she had asthma.

It's very simple, but everybody cannot do it because you must be a person who is authorized. You must have your vibrations flowing; otherwise it has no meaning. So it is absolutely one; absolutely it is to be understood, but you cannot make a [circus]. You cannot sort also make a hypocritical announcement about it and you cannot force, "Oh, that [I know / no] you are that". If you are that, you are that. If you are not, you are not. It is so simple and once you accept this part you will be amazed that you will progress much faster but one should be able to face it which is a very great thing. The first concentration comes from your own ego. It's the horrible stuff sits on the head here. Or this is the ego, is the by-product of the activity on the right hand side,- I must say. And it presses this one down to such an extent that you can become congested on the Agnya, and the [whole thing].

So you can become a [NAPOLEON / napoleon in] as far as your thinking is concerned, can bring you that. And when it starts pressing it, you really don't understand, "How my ego is now giving me ideas." And the ideas you will find are so idiotic and so foolish sometimes that you realize suddenly after Realization that this is not you. This can't be because you start seeing also.  First of all, as we see now, you can see Me. I can see you. I can see this lamp. I say, "Oh, this is the lamp." That means I am not that lamp because I can see it.  All right? Then I can see this room, or this is the room. That means I can see the room. That means I am not the room. I can see these hands. So I'm not the hands. Now I say I can see this body. So I am not the body. I can know My brain. So I am not the brain. I can know My thoughts. Then I am not the thoughts. It's something definitely wrong with the person, that's what you are. We see no-s [?] and understand. And that's what resides in your heart, reflected in your heart as the Spirit. In Sanskrit language is called as Atma. I'll give you some Sanskrit words for which you must excuse Me because I'm not so good at English first of all. And moreover you see in the Sanskrit language only there are some words which are very expressive.

Perhaps as you have developed your science and your outward life much more, in the same way in India perhaps people didn't have to face life in the way you had to face here the dangers of nature. Or we can say the life in India is naturally much more peaceful because there is sun, there is no problem of rain, is not rain cycling, you have clear-cut what you call the different seasons and so people know how to manage their life in a simple way. That may be the reason that they tried to search within themselves and from ancient times they have been finding out what is the way to be transformed and in that finding they were coming, it's about that coming to gurus. And in that coming to the gurus, of course it should be popular but some people who [can deliberate / have celebrations] about it. And those [deliberations/celebrations] have created I would say three types of [schools] which are to be understood. One is that goes onto the right, another comes onto the left, and another one goes to the center.

So we have got on the right hand side, the supraconscious area, we call it and beyond that, is collective supraconscious area. On the left hand side we have got the subconscious area and beyond that is the collective subconscious area. And on top here it is supraconscious area where we enter into the subtleness of divine power and start [INAUDIBLE]. That is what one has to achieve. That is what is to be born again, to be twice born. So many people I've seen saying, "Mother, I'm already twice born." I didn't know what to tell, because they are wrong. If they are I would love, I mean, I would love to see that they are, because these people, same language they'll understand, [up to a point / they have that power]. But when this happens to you, it's best to take [place, this], you get connected to the whole.

For example, say, this is God, and you are a part in that, once you get Realization what happens is that you get connected with God and you start feeling the whole and that's how you assume, I would say assume, you actualize, collective consciousness, because you just start feeling the centers of others as well as yours. You start seeing yourself because Self-realization comes and you start seeing others because you become connected with the whole. So everybody is conscious that we have to be part of the whole. If we do not understand this cycle, if we do not understand our position in the whole we become malignant, we become cancers.

Now the idea of "on my own" there cannot be any life that could be on its own. I was amazed, the other day I was listening to one of the programs in "achieving whole is a long search" and they were all talking about wholesomeness and that people are searching for wholesomeness. And the most amusing thing was that they ended up in milking a goat. I just don't know how it comes to that. To become the whole if you milk the goats how do you become one with the whole? I just couldn't understand. But they blame all the modern sciences and the modern technology and modern living for all the tensions that they have got. And that's how they say, "If you take to goats it will be all right". This is not so. This is an absurd, very misleading conception of life. I agree modernization [and / has] too much of artificialities of life, have taken you away from the beauty of life, I would say aesthetics of life, or the strongness of life, peacefulness of life, but it has not taken your way from reality by any chance because reality is there to be taught to you. On the contrary, some of the science things are of great help to Sahaja Yoga and I must pay My tribute to it. For example, now, My photograph has the vibrations of very, I mean I wouldn't say as good as Me being there, but quite a lot the presence you can feel it. And we have cured people through My photographs. Now, if there were no photographs I don't think that people [would] have worked that fast.

Then there are many other things which work out. For example, I speak on the loudspeaker. And one of the disciples told Me in India that, "Mother, we see Your vibrations getting into the mike which You are using.  But again, we see them again relayed out from the loud speakers that [they are / are there]." I said, "Is that the thing?" So I started using the mike on My chakras [plan] and it worked wonders. I was surprised that how it is expanding. So all these discoveries have come to us as a blessing from God. He Himself has given these to us, for us to finish our mundane work, day-to-day work. Imagine you could not have been here today. You have been ploughing your field somewhere and you must be walking for miles together to come this Church Street, you see. But when this it's worked out in this way and saved so much of time. And people know that time is important. They are having watches and they say, "You must save time. You must save time". For what? What are you saving? You ask somebody, "I must save time. I'm very late." Getting late? What's it? "I must go to London." I said, "What is it?" "I have to attend a ball." That's the thing you need time for. Also you must ask somebody else's, he'll say, "Oh, I must go to the pub with the friends," you see. Is this the way are we going to save our time? So the, even the unconscious is trying to give us a proper guideline to be finding that superior power.

By running away from anything you are not getting it. You don't have to run away from London to get it. You run away to any furthest place from London, still you will be there with all your problems, with all your ideas about things. I've seen people who have been in the jungles, who are living in the jungles, all right. But they will have a compound to their house. I said, "Now, why you have a compound?" Then they have a locker. Then they... so I said, "You are still carrying the same germ in your head. You think you have achieved a lot of freedom by running away." What is there to run away when you are free? If you are absolutely free what is there to run away? You can face reality and enjoy it when you are absolutely free, and that absolute freedom is to be achieved. But the idea of freedom also is so much clouded in us that we think that if we play into our weaknesses we are the freest beings. If the society allows us to enjoy our weaknesses we are blessed. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised tomorrow some sort of laws may come up that you must allow people to thieve. Possible. How can you say they [will come]? Because people are so fond of thieving, you know. If we have some kleptomaniac in majority, say in any country, they may say that, "You must allow us to thieve, because we are all kleptomaniacs. We enjoy that." And they may have a complete enterprise which is [legit / limited] to all kleptomaniac style of habits to be pampered, you know.

So to allow any our weaknesses to sit on our head is not the way we are going to be free. Freedom comes by which we become so powerful that nothing can enslave us. We enjoy our freedom and we worship the freedom of others. We understand them. We never aggress on others, nor do we take in aggression but we stand in our own [UNCLEAR] of our own free will. That is what freedom is. But that, all those ideas I cannot correct by just standing here and giving you lectures. It's another brainwashing. But what happens when the Kundalini rises She enlightens all these centers. By enlightenment you start seeing the whole thing. Like in this room if it is dark I can't see anything. But if there is light I can see everything clearly and I can create everything you can become. I know what is what, what is the use for what. But if there is no light I cannot see. And this is what is the enlightenment, when the Kundalini rises. She enlightens all these centers and when these centers are enlightened within us we have physical, emotional, mental and spiritual enlightenment by which we get completely integrated and we start seeing the things as they are, relating them as they are, and we find our peace within.

Now it sounds very fantastic. It's too much to believe. "After all, see Mother, we can't explain." That's true. I must say, it is fantastic. I mean, I am Myself surprised [UNCLEAR] persons here the way it's really fantastic. But it is not also, because this all building up has taken thousands of years within you. It has been built up all everything nicely. It could be if you supposing take a nice television set in India and if you have electricity by chance in the village which is probably not. But supposing there is electricity and you put the television and if it starts working people say, "How can it be?" Because it is unbelieving, it's a miracle, how can it happen? Or telephone for example, you see. People when first the telephone started, I remember in My house, telephone came for the first time when I was seven or eight years old. And we used to ring up the whole day and the whole night to our friends, and were so excited about it. We couldn't believe how we could talk to some people who are away from us. But this is what it is that your instrument is all ready but when it starts working, it starts working. And the whole thing then [it looks, becomes] so fantastic and you start feeling that power within you by which you know also all the answers to all your [absolute / absurd] questions like, "Is there God?" You ask the question now in your heart, "Is there God?" and the answer will be given through vibrations, you see. You ask about any absolute question, a rapport will be established. Like you are a computer and the computer which is very minutely built in so many years and ages, and so many [kind / guidelines] of wisdom that now it just starts. It is just that.

Now if I have to say that it can be understood rationally you cannot understand because the triggering takes place by which you enter into the realm which is beyond and there you see everything and you feel the whole thing is just a [game / dream], a drama and you are just a witness which is also established in the value system. Now I am just separating [parts] here because we are mostly have come through that [train / way]. But I was amazed that if you are sincere about, Christianity also [about / got] churches and they think that they are good for nothing. So then I have to say that Sahaja Yoga is not any religion outside. It's not an organized religion by human beings. It is a thing that is within us, is spontaneously happening within us and it works out absolutely without any concern to your community, race, or to your color, or to the nationality, or to the position or whatever may be the relationship you may have with each other. For the husband may get Realization; the wife may not. My own two daughters are not yet realized. Can you believe that? But My own grandchildren are born realized and they are great people.

So this is what it is possible. And whatever is so and in this country, I must say as I have said it many times that I think this is the heart of the universe. That's how I was just placed in this country. I didn't come otherwise. I was just placed. As you know My husband got elected to this job and I had to be here. So I came down and saw how people here are very much more balanced, and are very wise and really scholarly types and if they get to anything they do it very fast. Get to anything itself it's very difficult. Americans, perhaps they have been disillusioned by so many nonsensical movements that everywhere they go they are [searching only] and they want to see it. [And / Now] let's see what's it all about. It's another story [for you all].

So I have to tell you one more thing that you haven't come to give Me anything. Actually, you cannot give Me anything. That's the sign which is. I'm the One who can only give you. Like you take so much from nature. What can you give it? You cannot. But after Realization you'll be surprised you can give vibrations to the nature. And this can be done in a way that nobody can do otherwise. If you, if you see a farm which has been vibrated and which has been tilled by realized souls you'll be amazed. They produce ten times more wheat and the wheat has a special glow about and it is so nice. I've seen with My own eyes and I was amazed. I have been amazed about it. You see, these things are so much to be understood and you can deny but unless and until it happens to you, one should not believe it but once it happens you will be amazed and then you must believe it. Because even then if you do not believe then it's a dangerous thing because then the vibrations will die within you and they start disappearing from you and then you are amazed and then you call Me and say, "Mother, it was all right first day. I got it but then I lost it." So that should not happen to all of you.

I wish you all a very good life. Let's see now what is the situation with all of you and let's work it out. We have people here who are just like Me and they got realization and now they are growing and they are enjoying their life and they are not at all bored. Also they are doing no compromises. I do not want to tell you at all, "Please do not do that." About many things that [should be] understood. They are aware of it, you see. And it will happen Your all priorities will change, and you'll be such a different person that you could just not do that because you [won't  / want to] enjoy yourself.

When you start enjoying yourself, when you get the nectar of life, when you get this [and want it / worth within you] then you do not go for these cheap, frivolous [things / states], then you won't destroy it. It is automatically from within. It is not done by any force or by any conviction, or by any talking about it. It just happens. So may God bless you.

Such a big [lecture / large subject] you know that I cannot [talk / cover] in this short time and I have to tell you why I have been late at you. [UNCLEAR] perfect but I was very late and I went round the [whole / suburbs] [UNCLEAR]. Perhaps the vibrations had to go round and I had to go round. Gavin is always saying that. And that's how Gavin got lost. He never gets lost normally. [UNCLEAR WORDS] and again, after all, he represents part of you but there are so many others who can master it and I had to go later. So I was enjoying this. And now I was saying, "It is very late but I would like to see how the position is."  Before that I would like you to ask Me sensible questions, but why I say sensible questions because you know there are some really cracked people, some just coming from the lunatic asylum. We had one like that. And he came out with such a horrible question I looked at him and I knew where he came from, [went all right / were not] Linda? But then we realized that he was very. He's cured now. He's cured. He's very much better. So all kinds of people we have. So I would request you ask sensible questions as good to you, and which will be helpful to your [life ultimately / ascent]. [UNCLEAR]

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR] vibrations.

Shri Mataji: I am all right.

Sahaja Yogi: You look fine...

Shri Mataji: I'm all the time all right. I wish everybody could have that. Very good. You ask the questions.

Sahaja Yogi: Excuse me, Mother, I have [a handicap with hearing and such but / the theory in Sahaj] but if I look at your photo [I'm able to / I did] feel the coolness in the hands immediately and I'm terrible for rests and I did feel after a while [not only] just now, [the / that kind of] pain disappeared which I had [UNCLEAR] [questions / for discussion] etc. But it will that be sufficient, if I done [nothing / that] each day and then do that for about ten minutes and I mean apparently I was being worked on as well by someone. [Will / Would] it be OK [with it / later]?

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, it should be. You see, once you have touched it, also you've touched it. You are just there. But you have to maintain it and keep it up. I would say the situation is like this that if you are getting drowned, you see, and you are brought in and put in the ship or on the boat, now you still remember that, you see, so many again have toppled out. So steady yourself. Now somebody asked Me, "Mother, when are we steady?" I said, "When you are steady you are steady." You don't find this question anymore once you become steady. So there is no guarantee of time or anything but it can be just a minute, a second also it can work out.

Sahaja Yogi: Thank you Mother. I am trying concentrating on the [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: It's already, you see, worked in you. And your ears can be improved also. It's not difficult to improve your ears. We'll tell you some methods by which, because of this center being in trouble your ears are affected. If you can improve this center your ears will improve, you see? All right?

Sahaja Yogi: Maybe it is something in.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] Get anything? On both hands you are getting cold?

Sahaja Yogini: No, I suffer from epilepsy.

Shri Mataji: What?

Sahaja Yogini: I have got epilepsy. [UNCLEAR] also clearing.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that is clearing Hamsa.

Sahaja Yogini: My Hamsa?

Shri Mataji: Yes. All right?

Sahaja Yogini: I suffer from epilepsy Mother [UNCLEAR]. Doctor said...

Shri Mataji: I can quite understand, you see, because your Agnya is caught. But now I would say that... it's just for a short time. Now when did you get epilepsy?

Sahaja Yogini: I got the epilepsy last year.

Shri Mataji: Did you go to any guru or anything? [MISSING PART] Now, we should have brought. You know you'll be amazed we use some chilies or lemons [UNCLEAR] chilies and lemons, you see. And those lemons you can vibrate. They have such absorbance of vibrations that they keep the vibrations within themselves and in the night the vibrations come out and work on a person and then one could get all right. So you worked it out? Good, good, all right. So we'll work it out for you. Now, what else? What is the other problem? Epilepsy is cured but you have to be a bit cooperative, all right? Are you feeling better now?

Sahaja Yogini: The main thing is I've got it [UNCLEAR] since I got the epilepsy last year disturbing [the right / of the] Agnya.

Shri Mataji: Shoebeat, all right? It's a question of this center being blocked. And when this center is blocked then that also sucks [UNCLEAR], and that spoils the Hamsa. But do you know a simple method of curing this one after Realization is the mantra for this center is Lord's Prayer. After Realization you have to say Lord's Prayer to get it cleared because Christ is the One who actually keeps us away from the spirits and, I mean, these horrible dead spirits, you see, who live on this. They don't want to leave you now. They hang around where they enter in, to live and trouble you. It's worse seeing the way they affect people. But I've seen in the churches; now for example here is a church and I'm going round and I saw huge, big these blocks, say, which are used for the tombs, you know. So they must be having lots of dead spirits. Where is this? Now if you go to the church you will not get realized, but you get possessed.

I don't know from where this idea came into the mind of people to put all the dead in the church, in the city. I mean even if you want to have a church for them you can have them outside. That is only for the dead. But your children go there. You all go there. I mean, no wonder people are getting mad here because these are all dead spirits and out of them maybe at least five per cent are dissatisfied souls and five per cent are [despaired] people. Because whether is a saint or [different person, a sinner] they are all put [there / together]. And they might be affecting you. So I saw and I was rather amazed, such people used [mugging, mumbling]. Have you seen? Have you noticed? Are all placed against the bottom. I mean, you should watch better now when are you going to the church where the deads, [because look, how many are going to reach] the God? So this is what it is. You must understand all about all these things that can affect you, that can trouble you, and then when we realize it then we can control them, I mean control our own problems, and can control them also. They have no reasons to be here at all. We have nothing to do with them. They are dead and gone. We are in the present; they are in the past. They should be in the past. So they want to just enter into this area and want to manifest.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, You talked about the dead entering the living. Could that have happened to my mother? She was knocked down by a car and banged her head and three months later she found my father dead and since the [UNCLEAR] she is not the same person anymore.

Shri Mataji: So she can be cured, My child, absolutely that. Absolutely, she can be cured.

Sahaja Yogini: This is my father fault. [UNCLEAR WORDS].

Shri Mataji: Yes, of course. Yes, yes, absolutely. It's not question of haunting, you see. The father feels for the mother that he thinks that she is been knocked down by the car and he feels concerned about her. So he is to be told and he can go.

Sahaja Yogini: I have thought that inwardly but I haven't able approach her for the moment and want to very much.

Shri Mataji: Where is she now?

Sahaja Yogini: She is in [UNCLEAR] in Yorkshire. She's not here tonight.

Shri Mataji: But you can [get / give her] [UNCLEAR] and then [UNCLEAR]. It's not even [UNCLEAR]. All right? So that's now very common. It's a very common disease, very common disease. All right? It's very common.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, from my house, I have to speak on behalf of my wife, who let me here, you see, because she can't speak herself but she did write you a letter and we brought it this morning but there was nobody here so could get be in. So it's actually a letter from her explaining the problem.

Shri Mataji: Can you tell Me [just now what is the problem / the matter then]?

Sahaja Yogi: Pardon?

Shri Mataji: Can you tell Me just now what is the problem? You can ask her. If you can speak about it, but if you feel that it is not all right then I don't know.

Sahaja Yogi: No, the problem is that last August she began losing the power of her voice and now she can't speak at all, not to any extent.   If she spoke you won't be able to understand her. And also she finds it very difficult to swallow and feels that she's choking when she swallows. And she's seen doctors and specialists, consultants. They don't know what causes it and they say they haven't any treatment for it.

Shri Mataji: Absolutely. It's just the same. It's nothing so difficult. All right? She's catching on the Vishuddhi chakrah, here, this one, there, at the back and that's how she has got it. Very common. Then you come, you come and see our program.

Sahaja Yogini: This is the lady.

Shri Mataji: She's the lady?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: You can work it out on her.

Sahaja Yogi: My little boy here cannot speak or hear.  He's deaf and dumb. Could anything be done?

Shri Mataji: [INAUDIBLE] So got any problems? You have?

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: About you?

Sahaja Yogi:  The heart chakra.

Shri Mataji: You have a heart trouble? Are you frightened?

Sahaja Yogini: No, not really, I'm not frightened. [I've got this cold / Not frightening is the only problem]  I don't have the energy to do anything. It is coming from the angina.

Shri Mataji: Angina is curable.  You have to meditate. It's all right. Have faith. What do you want?

Sahaja Yogini: [INAUDIBLE]

Shri Mataji: This [SACREDISM] you told me it's a very small [UNCLEAR]. This, see this is a bondage itself. But this is [INAUDIBLE] not very cold, you see. [INAUDIBLE]. And certain thing it is totally absurd about [UNCLEAR] I mean, especially during the winter [UNCLEAR WORDS]. But really, you must have a bath. Whatever may be the cold or anything, you all have baths, every day. And then you go out, you see. And they take here because it's cold, they take bath in the [INAUDIBLE]. But I was amazed [when] I was in some of Himalayas villages, they never take bath, always is cold, absolutely cold. You see because the difference in temperature is so much there, they don't do it much. That's why if you look to the persons here, they do not take bath too much. And solve lots of problems, see, of having very few bathrooms and this. And secondly the another thing is that even if they take it, they take it in the night. But that should be religiously and should not be avoided because when you take your bath you should not go out at least for two, three hours because it catches.

And secondly I've seen here when you go out mostly what happens that, I mean this portion is always kept opened because you see this portion is regarded as something which should be shown [UNCLEAR]. It will look hardly to cover this portion of your mouth and [NOSE]. But I think this might be one of the reasons some women have [UNCLEAR], some problems. But if you could just, you see, if it is very, very cold by any chance if we could just cover this portion of our mouth, of our nose and the part of the mouth, you see, it would very good for us because there, you see, these troubles starts because of the sinuses and the sinuses get swollen up because of this cold coming on the nose. I mean, we cover the whole body, we cover everywhere but the nose is exposed. And because of that exposure, complete exposure, this portion gets inflamed and then the sinus starts working out here and because of that, you see, we get this trouble.

Now this is the chakra which controls it, is called as Hamsa, is this center here, which [UNCLEAR] come from there, which is quite [UNCLEAR] just below, yes just below [the center] [UNCLEAR] here, which works it out. Now the best way to get rid of this coldness is to be cautious about the climate, cautious about, vigilant. But secondly there are so many things in Sahaja Yoga to cure this center which is the guiding one and which they will tell you how to cure this center, how to cure also this center. If you could cure these two centers then you cannot catch cold much. But another thing which is very good for the throat is salt. And there's a simple grandmother's [recipe / receipt] for this [UNCLEAR] that you take and heat a little salt and butter and put that in your throat and in sinus, little warm so that it clears out and the salt absorbs the cold. It's very nice and you'll feel very much better if you go for that. And you can take an onion and roast it and foment it here, cut it into pieces, cover this portion nicely so the sinus could be cured. It should be [done twice or three times / maintained for some time] before sleeping [UNCLEAR]. And there some other things also one can try.

But there is another method by which we can cure cold forever so that we can ever elude it which is called [UNCLEAR; GW: Neti?] in what you call, in the yoga. Because we use yoga wherever it is required and wherever the point is. We do not use yoga in the way people do, indiscriminately but wherever it is required. Like [UNCLEAR; GW Neti?]. It is required for people who catch very much on this center and get diseases. It's a kind of a water carrier that they have. We call that [bluh]. And that one has a, what you call, as a snout which is coming out just like a, just like a kettle. And when you put a little tepid water and salt in it, you can start pouring that water from one end to another and you'll be surprised that because of gravity from the other side it goes down in a proper manner, just like as if the water is poured down, you see, it goes on falling down. And when [it / the salt] [UNCLEAR] it sucks because of the vacuum that is created. It sucks all the mucus and everything from this center to the end, and you can also use it the other side, like that. If you do it for some or ten days both the [types, sides], you see, that you can gradually reduce it, and gradually reduce it. Then you absolutely get rid of cold. You do not get cold much. Because the salt goes there, sucks our all the problems and say about the treatment lasts about for few months or so which I can also teach you sometimes but [UNCLEAR] because I'm not experimented with it. Try to see. Because this is the first time I've seen that in this country I also catch cold. Because I have to have vibrations for your cold so I get cold. When your throat is all right My throat is all [sore  / swollen] because I accumulate that vibrations as cold and then it passes through you and you feel all right and I feel ill. It's like that. So it is the cold is the problem which you have as the national problem. And it should be dealt with it on a national basis on these days and this can be worked out. It will become absolutely cleared. It's not difficult. But if you have that problem you can work it out sometimes. You can get rid of the sinusitis. For the time being you can just heat the onion â€' it is very good â€' and use that butter. Butter, heat a nice butter to a boiling point and put some salt in it and let it cool down as much as you can bear it, I mean. Put it in the, here, and see that it is quite cool and good for [THROATS/thoughts] and then you can pour it through the nose and sip it up. It will be useful. It soothes your membrane and also salt is sucked, what you call it, through osmosis, it's sucked to inside. It is another grandmother's [recipe/receipt] which is very good for that.

If you have the salt here I can vibrate it for you. It's very good for the throat. You should use vibrated salt for the Vishuddhi. For liver also if you can use vibrated sugar it's good. I think that many people are suffering from liver, which you have not here but you all come there and I know you are a lot. So if you have [UNCLEAR] [bring it to this program / this is the problem]. Now what we do is to, from the hands, you see, the vibrations [start / are] flowing. When we do our hands in such a way that we put a sort of a [UNCLEAR] or sort of enlightening our aura so that nothing enters into us and you can enlighten others' auras also. There are so many ways how to put the bandhan but the vibrations must flow. That's the first. If there are no vibrations just get bandhan [again / at the throat]. So it is about physical [system / fitness]. Something else you are worried about?

Sahaja Yogini: Can I help a dog with a damaged spine, Mother? [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Whose?

Sahaja Yogini: My mother's dog. It's very cute. It's got a damaged spine through [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, by all means. Why not? You see, it's such, you got the vibrations, go. It's very simple, you put one hand to the dog and another hand to the photo. Just feel. It's [good / cool]. [I might say] it's your mother's; otherwise if I told you or anybody else's you would not have tried. Try, it's very simple. Just put your hands, just try.

Give bandhan.

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: How are you [UNCLEAR]? Are you all right? Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hands?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Good. Are you feeling also? You'll be amazed, you'll start looking much younger, all of you after [UNCLEAR]. I mean, I couldn't recognize people after Realization. Then I used to get realized souls, I must say. They said, "Mother, we've been to You. Have you forgotten?" I said, "Oh, what happened to your faces after that?". And they were so relaxed, you see. It's good, living in any place where so many people got Realization. What about you? Are you feeling the cool breeze?

Sahaja Yogi: I feel.

Shri Mataji: You?

Sahaja Yogi: Thoughts and swirl.

Shri Mataji: Let others see you. Come along here.
