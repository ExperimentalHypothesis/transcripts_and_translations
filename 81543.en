Carol, you've been quiet for a while. What have you got lurking in your mind?

Remembering, I think I was at Chelsham Road when you went to see Mother at that time, Gilman. I remember you coming back and telling those stories. It reminded me of Chelsham Road at that same time. Mother had given Chantal, Ray Harris' wife, some very beautiful jewelry when they got married. It was a pink jade in a silver setting.

Like you've all been saying, Mother feels what's in your heart, and I felt, "Hmm, I've just got married too, and Mother didn't give me anything." You know, it's terrible when you feel those things.

Then, before long—I honestly can't remember if we went to Brompton Square with Louis, but I think so—Mother apologized profusely to me that she hadn't already given me anything. She went into her bedroom, found something, and brought me a little pink jade necklace in a silver setting—very, very sweet and beautiful—and a beautiful bracelet. I was going to wear it today, but unfortunately, the chain just broke.

I suddenly felt, gosh, I should pull my ears. Mother just knows what's in your heart, whatever it is. She even apologized so much to me, and she apologized that it was only something very little, that it wasn't as grand or as big as what she'd given to Chantal. Yeah.
