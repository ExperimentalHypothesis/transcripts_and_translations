Shri Mataji: If it's all right. Can be?

Yogi: Mother please, if I...

Shri Mataji: What about her? Abishek [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: Mother, [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Gregoire: If you look at the [UNCLEAR] a lot of [UNCLEAR] it's no good, Mother.

Shri Mataji: She should not, this is because she has a history of abortion [UNCLEAR]. You want to take her?

Yogi: I don't know Mother. I mean I wanted to take her but if it is too much. The other way, I was a bit [UNCLEAR] to leave her alone in the [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: Where?

Shri Mataji: Let her come here and have, that's the best.

Gregoire: Why doesn't she come here?

Yogi: That would be the greatest idea but...

Shri Mataji: So that is the solution. [UNCLEAR]

Yogi: Help with the baby.

Gregoire: And then she can help Catherine [UNCLEAR].

Yogini: [UNCLEAR] then she will have the baby.

Shri Mataji: That's the best.

Gregoire: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Huh? She's all right, five months, she can do [UNCLEAR].

Gregoire: What month could she help?

Shri Mataji: Stay here, of course, of course.

Gregoire: Do the shopping more or less.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. She can [UNCLEAR], of course five months is not [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: It's a long way from the kids, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: And?

Yogis: For kids.

Shri Mataji: What?

Mathias: To go to India might be too much for her.

Shri Mataji: No, no five months is [UNCLEAR] I'm very careful about that. I'm very careful.

Yogi: She, she [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: So Mother you are staying at Christmas in Vienna?

Shri Mataji: Let her can come here and I'll send somebody from England because she knows German, she can manage. Somebody has to help with fevers and all sorts.

[UNCLEAR]

Gregoire: Question is, if I go to India should I wait until the child is born then go?

Shri Mataji: He can come.

Gregoire: I can come and the child will be born.

Shri Mataji: Yes, it's all right. The children are to be born.

[UNCLEAR]

Yogi: Whether our child to be born in Germany with no problems? 00:02:50

Mathias: There is a system here that when a child is born, the child is being put into the maternity ward with thirty other children, and mothers are sitting in several groups.

Shri Mataji: Is it?

Mathias: Now, is this allowed? I mean, this is how it is in Vienna.

Yogini: The clinic we have chosen is allowed to keep children, baby near the mother?

Yogis: [INAUDIBLE].

Mathias: This is how it should be, the baby should be always with the mother.

Shri Mataji: What about you? You also find out such a [UNCLEAR crazy reaction].

Yogis: [UNCLEAR A greek]

Gregoire: No we don't remember.

Shri Mataji: You like to speaking German?

Yogi: I mean Mother...

Shri Mataji: You find these out, no question.

Yogi: No, no Mother in Germany will it be auspicious also.

Shri Mataji: Will be auspicious?

Yogi: For the Germans.

Yogi: Would be auspicious for the Germans, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes that's all. There are good hospitals, very good hospitals in Germany, I must say.

Yogis: Some of them at least.

Yogi: [UNCLEAR]to stay close to this Mother, which is they're going to stay close to [UNCLEAR], which is an American bases. We should be heading out [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] That is normal [UNCLEAR].

Gregoire: So what is the best part of your journey where one should commit? At the beginning, is it the end?

Shri Mataji: It's six days or seven days, there will be seminar in all day, on the [UNCLEAR]. Mooladhara seminar. There are seminar, all the Sahaja Yogis are going to come and stay.

Gregoire: If you want to telephone to all people there, of course, please Mother.

Shri Mataji: People surrender to God.

Yogi: There's a [UNCLEAR cold booked] tomorrow.

Shri Mataji: Just like a [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: We have booked the call 7:30 tomorrow morning, 7:38, tomorrow.

Shri Mataji: What we can do is call later program like you said. First with have a big seminar on. All of us should be at the seminar, to begin, all right. So we decide, talk, already talk, meet each other, greet each other and remove the problems, solve them. Remove problems and anything should sort of in the six days. So that they will be absolutely fresh people going back. Then we go up and really teach, [UNCLEAR] all this. [UNCLEAR] I was thinking of going to the ashram, something like that.

Gregoire: Mother I have a suggestion, each week if we come, I mean [UNCLEAR] comes, Mathias comes, if I come. Could we work on this opportunity for a kind of round table on television? Now, either they work it out on little brother is missed and that's why they are working till a round table on television with us, we know. I mean we will be all right on television?

Shri Mataji: I don't know, you see that -

Gregoire: You first and then with us.

Shri Mataji: I don't know my brother had [UNCLEAR]. That's the way point but a little kindness, [UNCLEAR].

Gregoire: Why, why not? As we are in India, I mean could be a [UNCLEAR]. First you are a bit of a program, it should be of -

Shri Mataji: I will work it out! Let me go, I'm going down here to find out. You see my brother so anxious, he said 'Now I'm going to come to India and stay with Me, [UNCLEAR]'.

Gregoire: He is the first realised soul I met, you know.

Shri Mataji: The first realised soul you met?

Gregoire: After you I mean. Once I got my realisation, the first realised soul that I met was him.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Gregoire: Yes and I remember he was, he was meeting me, visiting you in Oxford. And I remember that he read some shloka about You, saying, What was the goddess? And then I said, I just wanted words to describe Her that was my reaction.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Gregoire: Yeah, yeah. He's the first realised soul I met.

Mathias: Is he the brother of..?

Gregoire: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Shri Lakeshmi?

Yogi: Not Lakeshmi, [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] Puja.

Yogi: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]...tremendously.

Yogini: We had a very good talk with my husband. We enjoyed them very much. We had an evening at our place.

Shri Mataji: He is very intelligent, very sharp. In India, he is earning about 15 to 16,000 rupees per month, can you believe it, at that age.

Mathias: Being a lawyer?

Shri Mataji: Lawyer institution. My brother says it's My father, before him because My father did also constitution there. He's so dynamic.

Mathias: And he is doing a lot of work, free, just for poor people.

Shri Mataji: He's very generous. He's very kind hearted, but he has a horrible mother, horrible. [UNCLEAR] from very childhood, he was.

Mathias: Mother, when does the trip in India start?

Shri Mataji: 18th.

Mathias: 18th.

Shri Mataji: For six days. Six days we are going to be in [UNCLEAR].

Gregoire: When are these six days? Mother, from the eighteenth of June. So I should take my leave from the eighteenth from December to the eighteenth of January.

Shri Mataji: Yes. You see, the thing is when you want to come back here. The thing this time, I've done differently from last year. Last time, [UNCLEAR] so many people came for a few days [UNCLEAR]. So that had not going to [UNCLEAR]...

Gregoire: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: And now both Indian, I mean English, all English have to bring Me, England. Because for [UNCLEAR] is a big problem in there. Some of them make a real big hanky panky a lot. So now that's not going to - I'm not going too.

Mathias: We will be going with Rustom, who is a [UNCLEAR] packs of money like this.

Shri Mataji: Because of that money, we survive here, I tell you.

Yogi: Where was Anton?

Shri Mataji: Because then I will give you and I have to take out fifty thousand [UNCLEAR] from the bank. Which I returned, I mean partially [UNCLEAR] forty thousand out of the money, you see.

Mathias: Ah.

Shri Mataji: But you can imagine, we pay later when this is not [UNCLEAR].

Yogis: [Inaudible.]

Gregoire: [UNCLEAR] ...Seven years ago it was like this, all right.

Mathias: Because we have worked out Mother, on the...

Shri Mataji: The English are like that. [UNCLEAR]...

Yogini: They have money problems.

Shri Mataji: You much they have borrowed Me, never returned. This time again, I have paid again for so many people. Now, this time [UNCLEAR] you can do it or not Me. See I'm too compassionate, I said 'Oh my God'. No, there's no worry about it.

Gregoire: Mother? They will Mother. Just get this French [UNCLEAR bush] book out and it will fill it, Mother?

Shri Mataji: What French one?

Gregoire: The French book, get it out, and it will feel.

Yogini: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]... for that you don't want these people on the way.

Mathias: That's the way it comes.

Gregoire: Mother, Mother? That is why...

Shri Mataji: You should not become parasites.

Gregoire: That is why, when you talk about this Ashram business, that is why my reaction.

Shri Mataji: I know that.

Gregoire: Because Gavin suggested, I mean, my dearest brother Gavin, suggested Mother, see how clear that if those who pay for a house. Have this house for them reserve, their ego will it's much better than those who pay do not have any reservation or nothing, you see, so there is no ego. It's even better for those who don't pay at all.

11:05 [laughter]

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] who Linda brought [UNCLEAR]. Say, those who pay so much money whatever it is, see for a fact. Whatever is cost only they will do a lot in the ashram, [UNCLEAR idiots].

Gregoire: May I ask a question, because we have expenses. We are going to expenses for our own ashrams in Europe, so is this ashram really an essential corner where you think we are going to come, or you will stay or you will come here?

Shri Mataji: You see, you see the place [UNCLEAR Regard] which is about twenty five acres of land very near the river central, along the [UNCLEAR] river. I should say, is above I think thirty five miles [UNCLEAR]. That is the place I've been to just now, as ashram, [UNCLEAR].

Gregoire: What so for us, what is the person for us? I mean if you are not there.

Shri Mataji: No, no I would be there quite some time, I would be there quite some time. You see but I'm [UNCLEAR crowded up]. But you have others for that usually, to work out with the whole office-ing. Everything is literature. All that you do better, because it will have a big expanse of land, [UNCLEAR]. To begin with, we'll be having this Bombay Ashram if we get the land, also very far fetching. But let's see if we get this land, then we can have an Ashram [UNCLEAR]. Then we can move people from there to there, where I can give you, all of you on each separate cut for yourself, see each [UNCLEAR] of yourself. You prepared and all that which ultimately in return.

Gregoire: Is it very hot as a place Mother? As Pune?

Shri Mataji: No only people, you can stay there for about six months and six months, you have to come to your country or travelled and in Sahaja Yoga [UNCLEAR job]. 13:04

Gregoire: It means I will, should be there.

Shri Mataji: And in ten months you have to come.

Gregoire: And monsoon?

Shri Mataji: Monsoon? Monsoon for, you see six months everywhere [UNCLEAR], six months.

Gregoire: Because Delhi summer is unbearable.

Shri Mataji: Summer, and monsoons. These are the six months in [UNCLEAR], [UNCLEAR] and [UNCLEAR]. I hope you will start enjoying it, you see how magnetic. You see once we start properly then we start even enjoying monsoons and all that.

Gregoire: Mother, I was thinking that another question has been that, I think, which for climate was would have been very good. Would have been a hill station, like Shiva, however, when you were born because then...

Shri Mataji: I was trying to get something there, Chhindwara is too much in the [UNCLEAR] might get something here. You know one day, you see you know the expand will be the mainland of God but maybe. But this land is in my view is...

Gregoire: Is what you want. 14:05

Shri Mataji: I think so, because it's a very pure land of that, India, the heart of God, people are simple. We can have our own poppy, our own gardening, grow our own foods, things like that. We can have our room, house, self maintained and self managed and will be untouched by. If you go to any place which is a city, thing like that, then everybody comes in when it feels the chance for people. But first starts to say, of course, they have to travel no doubt, no doubt they have to travel but for them, for their Sahaja yoga and all that. A place we must settle. The house won't be more than Â£2000 and not less than Â£1000 something to it, they actually told Me last year one thousand but that's not a blessing of God. So maybe above one thousand but not more. But, but [UNCLEAR family], everything. That is not today, maybe about two years later or so.

Yogi: Okay.

Shri Mataji: So, just now it's only up to survey the place. We can take and work it out and all this. That will be something we can have all those Sahaja Yogis of that calibre so that will be the Nirmalaji that we have established another way. Twenty-five people is a [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: May I, what, sorry. Why, where? [UNCLEAR].

Gregoire: I have a feeling maybe, wrong. This feeling is that your name is the most sacred one and personally, I think it is wrong to use it for places and things like that. You have a thousand names. So, let us, let maybe use another name, like Nirmala Palace.

Shri Mataji: This is the one I say Nirmala, but this is the selected.

Gregoire: But Nirmala Palace for Nightingale lane, I was shocked. I mean, it seems too cheap.

Shri Mataji: You didn't like Nirmala Palace?

Gregoire: Nirmala Palace is too cheap. I don't like it.

Shri Mataji: Did you say that?

Gregoire: Yes, it's sweet, but I don't like it. It sounds weird.

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Gregoire: Nirmala Palace. It's, number one, if one wants to put your name near Palace, it has to be still better than nothing else. Then it is not problematic.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR].

Gregoire: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Nirmala Palace. You see, because it came out of Palace from there.

Gregoire: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So there's a Nirmala Prasad instead.

Gregoire: Yes, Mother. Then it can be Chandika Palace or anything, no?

16:37

Shri Mataji: Palace should not be, it should be Prasad. Prasad is the blessings. That could be nice, blessings of Pune could be, better. But this could be Nirmala [UNCLEAR] or... The river's name is Nira. No, I don't know.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, your name is Nira.

Shri Mataji: Huh, yes. I have written in my childhood something, very, very small ago.

Gregoire: Salve Nira Nagar.

Shri Mataji: It was written, I wrote Nira Chaddi means at the banks of Nira. Yes, I have written. Just imagine a long time ago, about six or seven years of age, a poem. Big poem, I remember it was but I don't know, it lost. My father, [UNCLEAR], have announced this thing, that thing. More like me, very nice.

Mathias: Mother, we were thinking a few people in Switzerland about having a school because most Sahaja Yogis in Switzerland, they are school teachers. They are school teachers and they've got a lot of experience. Switzerland is just a central place in Europe, for the UK, for France, for Italy. And kids, you know, some English people.

18:04

Shri Mataji: You better become slightly [UNCLEAR guilt] these children [UNCLEAR] can send to India. [UNCLEAR]. It's very small children you'll find, but if they are about eleven years of age then you can send them our centre in India. Where we can educate them [UNCLEAR].

Mathias: We just not unacceptable that they follow a normal education. It's not good. I mean, I...

Yogini: I see you, I see you.

Shri Mataji: No, in India also we can't follow a normal education. You see, students from India are coming here to study after doing this. But eleven years, till the age of eleven years, they can behave. Because the curriculum here is so bad. The posture is so bad for children. That's what you do. Keep the children here after eleven years, no doubt.

Yogi: [Mumbling eleven years]

Shri Mataji: You see, then the children and then they should be trained and then they can do what they like because that curriculum is accepted here. I don't know if the children who study here, how far they can come there but you have to include English as a lot of languages.

Mathias: It will be, actually the top language. No, this would be the language of teaching and then other languages will be a second, then a second language.

Shri Mataji: Plus you can teach Marathi, Hindi, all these kinds.

Yogi: But if we make a school, one should be one school for Europe, Europe is a smaller place.

Mathias: Ya, so it could be in the sense of...

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] you can make it was before the traditional.

Yogini: Small children.

Shri Mataji: Of eleven years of age or otherwise, [UNCLEAR] was telling me that in the school at the age of ten and eleven, they smoke! They behave like husband and wife close to each other. They kiss and they hug each other. They talk like that. I can't understand them, it's so ugly, so ugly.

Yogi: Yes, it's disgusting.

Yogini: Even in the kindergarten, the story and the words they say, it is really something else.

Gregoire: It's a [UNCLEAR] Mother.

Shri Mataji: Such a [UNCLEAR]. Apart from that they are given kind of... And I also apart on that, you see, this, the way, if you try to save them, they could create more people.

Mathias: And like we just...

Shri Mataji: At that age.

Mathias: And what I heard, Mother, is that children, you are just a teacher. Makla's a teacher, Antoinette is a teacher, Susanna's a teacher... Sofia's a teacher.

Shri Mataji: And you can send your teachers to us also?

Mathias: Sofia is a teacher, Mother.

Gregoire: It will be six months in India, six months in Geneva.

Shri Mataji: Yes, they can come.

Gregoire: But why not make a central school in Geneva? Because Mother if I may suggest, just one thing of what Antoinette said which is very true. That Geneva has a great tradition for pedagogy. There is Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and there is Piaget, Oumet, who's a realised soul, who's a great psychologist. And there is a whole tradition of teaching.

Shri Mataji:..For that. What... not to seven, eight.

Gregoire: Not in the city. Somewhere in the middle...

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]... I just said your children. If you want to send them because that's the most [UNCLEAR] and the worst...

Gregoire: We can be the help, [UNCLEAR Mam].

Yogini: [UNCLEAR]... with my children. 21:18

Shri Mataji: What's this for?

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: How do you start this for that? [UNCLEAR] even grown up, you can send them.

Yogi: So many things can happen.

Yogini: Yeah.

Yogi: Quickly, [UNCLEAR my leg].

Shri Mataji: No, no, it's a very ego-oriented society also. The whole thing is very egotistical. The whole thing bleeds the people.

Mathias: We just walk out from the house, Mother and then it starts.

Shri Mataji: It starts, the whole thing bleeds. I think we are living in the body. The whole thing is breaking, breaking, going, going, going.

Mathias: We are not actually saved by children because what we do now in Geneva, we just, on the street, we spot our little kids and we give the kids realisation all the time. It just keeps us from one house to another. You know, this is how we want another one to be affected. We go to parks Mother, and we give realisations to kids playing there. And this is an excellent way of putting our attention in our Sahasrara.

Shri Mataji: I hope it works out, because it helps, terrible. You see, the things that attack from the innocent, your eyes.

Yogini: Absolutely, Shri Mataji. Thank you for that.

Yogini: I have some sight with my children.

Shri Mataji: One thing, the old men having feelings for the young girls, for sixteen year old girls.

Gregoire: Even less than that Mother but I don't want to go into details but they actually have pornography with children. Children of the age of Antoinette's age, of Antoinette's children's age.

Antoinette: Yes but even in the villages, the teachers are all right, I can see them. They are very good, straightforward models, you see and very good.

Shri Mataji: But what about the children?

Antoinette: I had a lot of homework with them because I couldn't tolerate some things they were saying, coming back at home. And I made sometimes a big fuss about it quite clearly, you see, and they were quite agreeing with me. And they saw and I said, 'Oh yes, they know which boy and which family they were saying such funny of things', you see. They looked up and then I said, you see, but that one shouldn't tolerate. And I think you, as a Mother...

23:29

Shri Mataji: You see, they can't help you until now.

Antoinette: Yes, I know, but sometimes it's good if you just can say it and then...

Shri Mataji: You see, the parents say now that the laws are such that you can't say anything. You see, the parents are the ones because that's the big problem.

Antoinette: Yeah, exactly. And they know sometimes.

Shri Mataji: You see, the parents are quarrelling. They are going for divorces.

Antoinette: Yes.

Shri Mataji: The parents are quarrelling. They don't care for their children. They don't want any problems, anything. Then the children go to hell.

Antoinette: Exactly.

Mathias: I'm working next to the bar to which many children are being brought for play and I could see that the teacher would have absolutely no...

Shri Mataji: - Control.

Mathias: Control over the children, they would play whatever they wanted. Now, the teacher would even tell, there is two teams playing football and they would mix the teams, women and the boys are playing football. They would kick each other, they would brutalise each other. They, from the very beginning, they treat women the same way as men. You see? There are problems there can be. If you do not make the distinction and do not choose special games for the boys and the other games for the women, you just cannot work out any respect to these women. Because women are always weaker in this kind of sports, compared to boys, behave very well.

Shri Mataji: In India, I was invited to India to find out that people behave and there was a big discussion on the BBC about this one. That why not the girls are allowed to play with the boys? And let them play with the boys and they should enter into competition.

Mathias: They do box of somebody, boxing even.

Yogini: No. I'm going to give some lessons at Lawrence's and our school of Porcelain, you see? So that I enter, I need to begin the staff there and to teach.

Shri Mataji: This you have been?

Yogini: No, no, no, no, Shri Mataji. I just want to, I will go and teach to play for the children. Children, you see?

Shri Mataji: That's good, that's very creative. And so it's good...[UNCLEAR].

Gregoire: Mother, Mother, excuse me Mother, my feeling is if you, we cannot work it out in the UK. The whole of Europe is going to be distraught and what Sanjay or the others, one thousand or what, will take two or three Jingle Jets to India or Australia. Wait for Europe to be washed away and come back. That's the way I can see things.

26:00 [Laughter]

Yogis & Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Now three of them have got epilepsy.

Yogis: Who?

Gregoire: Sahaja Yogi.

Yogi: Which one, has it?

Shri Mataji: One of them was having a business without telling me.

Gregorie: In Ashram?

Shri Mataji: He accommodated all his stores in the ashram and was selling it. Another one was from Mexico in that he just tried to take advantage of the place and he stayed there. Everybody is trying to take advantage of the ashram. Now I don't know what to do. There's no discipline, nothing. And anybody who tries to prescribe this, they just sit on top of Me. I had a telephone of them in Portugal saying that you see, this thing is becoming very egotistical and he tells us to get up in the morning, he just forces us down. Then this, Mark, what's his name, this Mark [UNCLEAR Don]. He's quite blue, but her Don's wife told Nick that he should not wake up in the morning because his wife, the child has a very light sleep and the child is there. I said, all the children must get up in the morning. You see, the natural habit of children is to get up in the morning. We are the ones who have to wake up in the morning. We are the ones who spoil it. I said, they must all get up in the morning. They should be the first to get up in the morning. And from that little child, he stopped to see Me.

Mathias: Because women have a super odd mode of making men feel guilty for something. They all come, scoot me, and say something, and they see you all around.

Shri Mataji: It's hard, these women, however they do it.

Gregoire: You know Mother, at one point, who is present here?

Yogi in the background: I don't know. 28:03

Gregoire: It's all right, at one point, we went as far, Warren and I, to wish the disappearance of Mrs. J. Brown. Because we thought, okay, now, Gavin is great when he's abroad and when he's back in the ashram, he's...

Shri Mataji: But now, Jane is changed for your information.

Gregoire: She did. Then because then it should work out because she was the one who was stopping her need.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. But Gavin, you see, basically, is not a big, big person who cannot serve all these people. He is a person who is a quiet worker and he's like that. He can individually, he can help people. Like Don, Don started doubting and told Gavin, he worked it out, you see. But he's got a speaker also he has one hand care, he's not afraid of anything. And but I must say, he handed his wife so much. She's so bad, I tell you. I was amazed at his strength and that's how I came to pass. He came up. You see, when I told that Jane has to go away from the ashram, you better she leave the ashram and she has to go away. She has not to stay in London, she has not to see anybody, nothing like that. Otherwise, Sahaja Yoga is going to do two things. Jane, Jane, of course, is not an intriguer, nothing. She's not a person who talks about Sahaja Yoga, means in any way she doesn't, she's not an intriguer or in any way she doesn't carry on this way. But only bad thing she has is that she says things very sharp. And she just shuts down and she tries to cut down the people, sort of thing, you know, it's a bhoot in her and she knows she has a bhoot, you see. When I sent her away, you see, she went to her house and there was a puja day when she came back. And the girl came and asked me, 'Mother, did she ask me?' I said, 'No.' She said, 'I have not yet spoken to her, she is not asking her.' I said, 'Take your luggage and go away wherever you might. You are not going to be here till Mother says come here, immediately go over out of the ashram.' And She came, she said, 'Mother I'm sorry but please I know what communism is for I could have stayed'. She's sensible [UNCLEAR no doubt], she's a very intelligent, women. She's possessed. That's the only problem. No, no, she's, she's a first-class woman. Very intelligent, very intelligent and she comes out very sensible ideas. I must tell you this. She comes out sometimes very sensitive ideas. Only problem with it, she's possessed. She's taught us, she's taught us. She taught us people have their possessions. Sometimes it's going to be quite some time [UNCLEAR]. People they are there, you have to have a vibration from us. Who is Thomas? Where are we all?

Yogi: Great inside.

31:23

Shri Mataji: So vibration problems. Right, she has a proper vibration problem, need to help. You see, they can keep, if they're possessed, the position keeps on. You see, the culture of position is obstinate and it seeks an obstinate personality, it sticks on. That's why it's there but, but one can get over it, now you're all right. See?

Gregoire: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: All right? [UNCLEAR] On the ground.

Yogini: This?

Shri Mataji: Back.

Yogini: To me, to me.

Shri Mataji: Here, all right. We have to put it across, like this.

Gregoire: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: It's better, see?

Gregoire: Yes, I feel.

Shri Mataji: Your tolerance, so just clean the tolerance. Finished, get it out.

Gregoire: Thanks all, now that my work comes out as vibrations.

Shri Mataji: You know, your promised that. All right? What's your wife's birth, Gemini, is she? Isn't she? Huh? Gemini.

Yogi: Gemini is very comfortable enough. I'm very good.

Gregoire: My mother has a Gemini rising sign.

Shri Mataji: See? Yes. Gemini.

Yogini: My father is Gemini.

Shri Mataji: We have some very great Gemini. I don't know what the rising sign is.

Gregoire: Jameel?

Shri Mataji: Jameel is not Gemini.

Mathias: No, he's scorpion.

Yogis: He's scorpion.

Mathias: Magda.

Shri Mataji: Magda, Magda's daughter and David's wife. [UNCLEAR Jimmy Paul's wife] See? They, you know, they have accepted one thing and started with it. It's nothing. Are you also Taurus?

Yogini: No Mother, I'm scorpion.

Shri Mataji: And what is your rising sign?

Yogini: Scorpion or Sagittarian? I'm not sure about it. Scorpion, scorpion or scorpion?

Shri Mataji: Tell her to do it.

Yogi: What time of day were you born?

Yogini: Uh, nine o'clock in the morning.

Yogi: nine o'clock. Sagittarius probably.

Shri Mataji: Sagittarius?

Mathias: I was seven o'clock on the twenty eighth.

Yogini: Yes, but...

Shri Mataji: Now she's all right, but still you show left Swadhishthan. Still she shows left Swadhishthan. So I thought it might be [UNCLEAR Thomas], I thought.

Yogi: The moon maybe. We don't know if the moon maybe. [UNCLEAR Rashi] maybe.

Shri Mataji: Riding sign also.

Yogi: No, Rashi.

Shri Mataji: Rashi?

Yogi: Chandra Rashi.

Shri Mataji: Chandra Rashi, Chandra Rashi from [UNCLEAR Malay?]. That is what it is, Chandra Rashi.

Yogi: You see, because women, that is more powerful than...

Yogini: This is a scope.

Gregoire: Mother?

Shri Mataji: This is the scope, you asked Me. This is the scope.

34:10

Gregoire: Yes Mother, very. Another rule of behaviour which I would like to point out once, is that when we talk like this loosely, it has become a habit that people tape you and I don't know whether you agree or not. You agree? Okay.

Shri Mataji: You see, so many things are there to get us through life. I talk to you because I have to take out lots of things from you. You see, that's how it works out. See now, just saying dollars will be worked out. It's all right, because I know how far to go, where to get. It's all right, towards the [UNCLEAR] is all right. You should be very strong. You should not be frightened of Me. I'm so happy for these [UNCLEAR]. But, but you must know that I am not even more [UNCLEAR]. So, I told Mr. one day that you were calling me Mataji, oh, it's Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji. While addressing me, Shri Mataji is not Mataji. But it's value you find out. That helps, that's how you find out, everything you find out, doesn't matter. Better now? See. Did you start getting lessons? [UNCLEAR] Straight forward march. Ah. No, but Scorpio women are left sided, that's correct. Scorpio men are, Scorpio women can be left sided.

Yogini: I have Aquarius.

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Yogini: I have Aquarius as a rising.

Shri Mataji: Aquarius, you?

Yogini: Scorpio in the...

Shri Mataji: That's right, left side.

Yogini: I know.

Shri Mataji: What about you?

Yogini: I am Pisces.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Yogini: There's the balance rising.

Shri Mataji: Pisces are great seekers. [UNCLEAR] my spot. What? What?

Mathias: Shri Nirmala, who is in Sahaja Yoga, who could establish the astrological things for us?

Shri Mataji: I am going to be an astrologer. You know, we are astrologers. This is the science by which you go beyond astrology. You see? How see I am supposed to be, I don't know what I am. I am according to someone, I am born on three wrong works, I cannot say.

Yogi: No, but it's true, actually. It's zero.

Shri Mataji: But see, I would say that if I am in Pisces, I have never been seeking but still I will seek. You see, if I have an Aries, I never have the symptoms of Aries like C.P. in the Aries, absolute Aries. It's too Aries, very dominating. And you see, all dominated people are extremely fussy about things. 'I will not have this food.' You see, that's how they dominate. 'I don't like this food, I like that. I, I, I, I, I. It's not good. She can't be so old. She should be so old.' All the time like that for some ladies. That's not with me. But the sign of Aries is, you know, when they sit down, they, they go on nudging with their hooves. You see, they go on, you know, like this is their feet, like all the time. They want to see something all the time, like things like that. Because, especially with the feet, you see, with the toes. Toes, they start, could have made that, I think.

Yogi: Scratching.

Yogis: Scratching.

Shri Mataji: As if they're trying to take out the Mother Earth like that. You see. Even when they sleep, you see, they walk. Until this passes through then you will know but you see if they are sleeping and the thing is going on in their heads.

Mathias: Must be very uncomfortable with shoes Mother because you can...

Shri Mataji: Shoes are worn.

Gregoire: It is true.

Shri Mataji: Like two horns all the time but you must know how to play with them, then you'll see. You just, like I seen it in seekers trying to [UNCLEAR] it is very interesting. He told Me don't put any gold in here, you see you put any gold it will look very kind. I said, 'You can always remove' - 'No, no, no, no, no, don't put any, because even if you remove, it will look bright.' I said, 'It will be enough'. So I said, 'All right, come here I'll put a little bit let's see.' 'It's looking very nice, I don't know why?' I said, 'There is gold! Was like huh, I never saw the gold.' I said, 'What did you see?', 'You see, it was looking much better.' So, big eyes, you know, they can't see small things, they don't. So, that's how you solve the problem. Their eyes cannot see, you see, minute things. They will tell you, don't do this or don't do that but if it is so, they never see it. They never see it, a very large idea, very large. I wish I said, it's a large [UNCLEAR]. They love it, they don't see it, actually what they say, they never see it. Very interesting, you see, much people out there. I don't say any particular thing in this book or what is, what is bad, is this but I have seen Gemini are the most people. Taurus are not difficult but Taurus have a food problem which must be taken out, that's all. If the bhoots disappear, that idea...

Gregoire: How come? Where does it come from? What is the Taurus? What is it?

Shri Mataji: Taurus is an obsolete personality, Taurus is. And then what happens, it is a rebellious one. It is rebellious, you see also. Because it's obstinate, so it doesn't go with the wind, it doesn't go with the flow. It's obstinate, it sticks onto the ground and then he can see more it, that should be, because he thinks that I must. I have to down my foot, so I must say that this is the thing.

Gregoire: And Virgo, Mother?

Shri Mataji: And then Virgo balances. Virgo, Virgo is such a great quality that Virgo is, that it's a virtue. The virtue is behind. Means, you see, somehow they are special, isn't it? They have a sense of virtue. They respect the virtue, they believe in God. Virgos are great.

Yogini: And balance?

Shri Mataji: You see, because of the Virgin quality. So it's really hot like [UNCLEAR]. All right, check your centre. Machindranath, you, all these. See, one more has that speciality, chakra inside, virginity, bliss. [UNCLEAR] treat some of them. Whatever they are but the, the special of the world or they are very mother-oriented.

42:30

Yogi: Mother-oriented, yes.

Shri Mataji: Mother-oriented.

Yogi: It's not very, Virgo, I think.

Shri Mataji: Yes, mother-oriented.

Yogi: Correct?

Shri Mataji: I try to take mother-oriented, aren't you.

Yogi: Yes!

Shri Mataji: The relationship of, relationship [UNCLEAR].

Mathias: It's always Virgo.

Shri Mataji: It's Virgo.

Mathias: Oh, thought it was a phase.

Shri Mataji: Ganesha is a Virgo. Come here, come here Vashini.

Yogi: And Cancer, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogi: And, Cancer?

Shri Mataji: And Cancer, my [UNCLEAR friend] is Cancer. Chinwara is all Cancer. Chinwara is [UNCLEAR all that.]

Yogi: Topic [UNCLEAR].

Yogis: And the balance?

Yogini: The balance, Mother?

Shri Mataji: The balance helps, good but in a way, you see the warm balance between human beings. And sometimes when you want to say, you know the balance. You see, balance is all right. But balance for what? But balance is for what? You see? That's what I should not be biased.

Antoinette: And Capricorn?

Shri Mataji: Capricorns are great for us. They are very attached to their children. Well, family-minded, attached to children, too much attached. And they can make very good servants if they want. But a little possessive of their children can't be [UNCLEAR]... a little possessive of their children. 'And My children' and things like that. There are some kind of like, you see, tightness. You can touch your Sahasrara, much tightness, you see. [UNCLEAR] very honest but tell me sometimes what you want. Could be half that person. I will get you to tell her. They're innocent. Correct?

Yogini: Yes, my [UNCLEAR], my little daughter. [UNCLEAR]. My little daughter. She's absolutely what you describe, yup.

Yogi: Same Brigitte.

Yogis: Brigitte.

Gregoire: And [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: They very upright honest genuine, honest people. My mother was a Capricorn. Oh, God! Nobody can tell her that you've done this life this way. She would never. She never did all her life told lies. Can you imagine [UNCLEAR]? She really protected us like the tightness, all her children. I am nothing to it. No compromise over any concept. Nothing.

Yogini: Mother, once you told me that Capricorn is not a kind of seeker. They are not seeker. 45:36

Shri Mataji: Seeking is yes, in the Capricorn because they are so satisfied. They are great, they are good people. They give me their principles to you. See, because they have their own principles, this madness of seeking is not [UNCLEAR] so much. They are quite solid people, I should say. There's sort of mature wisdom there. They can be but you can't say, who's Capricorn?

Yogini: Me.

Shri Mataji: If you are a seeker, out and out. You see, it is not so absolutely...[UNCLEAR]...I mean, that's my experience. I am not an astrologer. You have to get out of it. What I am saying is you all have to get out of it. Capricorn women are good, men are not so good, I should say. While Scorpio, men are good, women are not so good, in the sense they get into problems, left sided. But men also are, you see, we have a similar thing, we need to have left side problems.

Yogi: Tony is also.

Shri Mataji: Tony is, then we should say, ah, Jamel! Jamel has left side problems. But there are tremendous Sahaja Yogis all on them, tremendous Sahaja Yogis that's why. They allow these things to go ahead, but they're not bothered, you see, they don't. But if they are women, they get dragged. I've never seen a woman or this fellow, for giving me a problem about their left sided problems. They just try to get..`. So, if the women having power, as the men have, you will least expect, big time. And if you have the power of your spirit, then what? Every. What's yours?

Yogi: Gemini, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Gemini!

Gregoire: The silent participant of...

Shri Mataji: Great ascent, great ascent for Gemini.

Yogi: What is your ascent?

Yogi: I don't.

Shri Mataji: Great ascent. You see these are the [UNCLEAR]. Great ascent.

Yogi: Grey?

Shri Mataji: Ascent for him, from Gemini. You see, he, I tell you, that the wife of the prophet then Magda, Rota, Danya, they are all pure Gemini's. What's the date?

Yogi: Nineteenth June.

Shri Mataji: Nineteenth. It's very far. It's absolutely very far. But still, you see, before the sixth June, I think it's problematic. Between the sixth June, yes.

Yogini: I'm Aquarius, Mataji.

Shri Mataji: What?

Yogini: About Aquarius?

Shri Mataji: Who?

Yogini: About Aquarius?

Shri Mataji: Aquarius is the Kundalini itself, Kundalini is, Kundalini is. Aquarius is great, it is the age of Aquarius is the Kundalini.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, do Devas, certain Deities rule, are certain signs attached to certain Deities or not? Certain signs are they more closely linked to certain deities?

Shri Mataji: Well now depends on [UNCLEAR] on that. Other ayudhas that they use like, if you have to say Shiva, I see. Shiva is like this and you have to do like that or this way is Shiva. You put your hand at this position, like this, it's Shiva and this is [UNCLEAR]. So, these are the signs attached to them. And [UNCLEAR London] is your Mother's, [UNCLEAR age]? It's not a little time, you see. You cannot cross over this part, you have to go like that. So, that's the way the best is. And when you live like this, it's the Krishna-shakti. You see, there are two hundred times, it's the Krishna-shakti. It's the Super shakti, you see, that there are these moments are according to [UNCLEAR Nishrat]. Left Swadhisthana is so much, going [UNCLEAR]. Just going out dha-dha-dha-dha-dha-dha-dha, you imagine. Absolutely and please say [UNCLEAR].

51:55

Gregoire: Probably right side.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] and maybe heat, sitting there. [UNCLEAR] it is pretty hot.

Yogini: Maybe it's coming from me.

Shri Mataji: No, no. Okay. What for food?

Yogini: It's coming, Mother.

Gregoire: We have our Italian detachment, our Italian squadron.

Shri Mataji: Italian.

Mathias: They are super Mother.

Shri Mataji: I feel like I eat Italian food more than any other food. Really, I think somehow something is real Indian style, I don't know. But it is an appetiser. It has an appetiser that can digest more food, you see but if it is just bland or absolutely English-style, you see, boys and stuff, then you can't eat so much.

Yogi: They put so much love in their food, Mother, as well.

Gregoire: We should hold it in the [UNCLEAR], because it's easier for them.

Shri Mataji: You see that the [UNCLEAR macarons] you sent.

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: They are very much appreciated. And they do not get spoiled or anything. Dry them in the sun or what do you do?

Yogini: Just dry it and then put it in the oil with red chilies.

Yogini: And garlic.

Yogini: Chili and garlic, yes.

Yogini: And garlic.

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Yogini: Garlic.

Shri Mataji: Garlic?

Gregoire: Chili and garlic, speak a little bit louder because Mother is back from Her puja and Her program.

Shri Mataji: Chili and garlic. And no, obviously, what do you call that stuff? What do you call it? Filca flowers, you know?

Mathias: Vinegar.

Shri Mataji: Vinegar.

Yogini: No, Mother.

Shri Mataji: No vinegar.

Yogini: Oil, oil, garlic, and chillies. That's all.

Shri Mataji: And dry it?

Yogini: Dry it, yes.

Shri Mataji: Can we eat in India, not here?

Yogini: Yes, it's very easy. We brought them here. We brought some here, Mother.

Mathias: We brought some here.

Yogi: We brought some from Rome.

Shri Mataji: We did?

Yogini: Yes.

Gregoire: To eat here is not easy. It's better than the thing. If we are not many, we can all eat. It's not comfortable to eat here.

Shri Mataji: It's not really. You say so? If you want, I can go there. Whichever you like.

Gregoire: I think it's easier. If you eat there better Mother, then we can all fit in the room, no problem.

Guido: Five minutes, we'll be ready.

Gregoire: Is it ready?

Yogis: Five minutes!

Shri Mataji: The idea was spiritual.

Yogi: Just surrounded by God.

Gregoire: The kindness, the kindness.

Yogi: The energy I mean. Oh, it's so beautiful.

Gregoire: The kindness of my Mother.

Shri Mataji: I can see it clearly, I have people here, [UNCLEAR so auspicious].

Gregoire: Well Mother, as soon as a first election is made, we enjoy having them at home. The first election is to be made not to have one hundred people. Machindranath, we want to be a bit careful.

Shri Mataji & Yogis: [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: What are you going to do with that?

Mathias: The people that are interested.

Shri Mataji: He's working out in home, I've seen that.

Gregoire: Machindranath.

Shri Mataji: There he is working out, he's working you out. He's [UNCLEAR]. Ah, let it grow.

Yogi: But it doesn't grow, he's already [UNCLEAR] Mother. Children..

Shri Mataji: Record that [UNCLEAR]. Where you are?

Gregoire: Where is your place? In London?

Shri Mataji: Living in, [UNCLEAR], we have there.

Gregoire: Which [UNCLEAR] you living at?

Shri Mataji: She will be there.

Gregoire: But this means that you will be in rehab?

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

Gregoire: No, I cannot say that she doesn't.

Shri Mataji: What? Yeah, it's very good. It's very dharmic according to... 56:40

Gregoire: Maybe it's too far.

Shri Mataji: Why? It's very foreign, right?

Gregoire: It's too far, it's expensive to get there.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, let's talk.

Gregoire: On the way.

Shri Mataji: On the way.

Gregoire: Ah, on the way.

Mathias: No, this is going to be expensive.

Shri Mataji: Why?

Mathias: Because Mother, we'll have to check it out but it all depends which flights you will have to take. For example, this is also linked to our date of departure. If we leave Geneva on the Twentieth, then we've got very cheap flight. If we leave earlier, it is going to cost us about eighty to Â£100 per head more.

Shri Mataji: No but regardless UK from flying, from Rome it is direct flight to [UNCLEAR Rear].

Mathias: Yes, but if he goes to the Rear, Bombay, he's going to probably pay from the full price.

Shri Mataji: No, that's the cheapest.

Yogi: Yeah.

Mathias: Is it really?

Shri Mataji: The cheapest is from, wait, it's the cheapest.

Mathias: Oh.

Shri Mataji: The cheapest. But if I say that if I want to come, I should come from Bombay, not from this.

Mathias: Here is the solution for us.

Shri Mataji: But we are in Parvola.

Yogini: I hear it is a good town.

Shri Mataji: Can't go, have to have a visa until very late.

Mathias: But if you have transit on there, then there is no problem.

Shri Mataji: Still. Itâ€™s difficult but it's only troubling.

Mathias: Who else can get the visa in no time?

Shri Mataji: I don't know

Yogi: No problems, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You see, the Rear is the cheapest to go. It's only... Don't look into the Rear is less than Â£300.

Gregoire: London is a special place.

Yogi: I can't...

Gregoire: To fly out of London...

Shri Mataji: Where is that? [UNCLEAR].

Mathias: Yes. But then flying to Rear is expensive, Mother. Because there are no cheap flights to Rear.

Gregoire: Mother?

Shri Mataji: I don't know. You have to find out. What's your role? Be there, I understand. If you go to Rear from there to India is the cheapest, among all the others.

Yogi: Because we could go from Geneva to Bombay return for less than Â£400. Less than Â£400.

Shri Mataji: All right. See, of course, this is going to cross the border. It's done in the same. [UNCLEAR] But if she is coming here, or if she is coming here, and you are going to get something from here then you can leave the child here tomorrow. She was going to Rear of course, whatever is the expense, I don't know. But you can just send the baby. She will be very happy.

Gregoire: Oh yeah something like that, I thought she would remember that, I don't know.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]. She is in Rear, she is not coming to England. She was completely England, here she comes.

[Dinner noises] 59:41

Shri Mataji: So youâ€™re not eating?

Yogi: No, Mother.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR Tommy] you're not eating?

Yogi: No.

Shri Mataji: Surprising.

Gregoire: I feel like I will not eat.

Shri Mataji: Movement a little bit. A little bit of movement is all right.

Yogini: Shri Mataji, this morning joining you...

Shri Mataji: Movement you have enough to [UNCLEAR say].

Gregoire: No, I feel like it more here, around it.

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Gregoire: I feel like you move.

Shri Mataji: If I move my head here.

Yogini: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: I'm not moving at all, you can't move one part of the head.[Laughter]

Gregoire: You move?

Shri Mataji: I can, yes easily. It's the chakra that's moving.

Gregoire: Oh yes, how do I feel like that? But it's coming, it's very fast. This is not a fast movement.

Shri Mataji: It's a fast, how do you see?

Gregoire: No, it's not like that. I feel like...

[UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR Maria Melia] has definitely achieved it, definitely.

Yogi: What Mother?

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR Maria Melia] has slowly achieved it.

1:01:36

Yogi: Oh really?

Shri Mataji: No doubt.

Yogi: Mother, happened in Portugal, something terrible in Portugal. So much anxious that they were trying to work out and so on, really.

Shri Mataji: Portugal is just tremendous.

Yogi: We thought once to go there. When we have good, when we, something like that.

Shri Mataji: There are a lot of things to sell.

Yogini: [UNCLEAR]. They just wrote to me and they said that they are not selling.

Shri Mataji: Why?

Yogi: Because some of the postcards you send arrive broken and the others, they are thinking of the most beautiful ones. They are thinking of keeping them for an exposition in December. So, they put very high prices in order not to sell them. But then on the other hand, if they do not sell, they do not have money to pay the shop. So...

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] very good price. You see, when we have a touristy park and the tourists don't do these summertime, summertime is now over practically. They should not boost their prices also.

Yogi: Meaning? Other [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: But nobody is going to buy them except yogis. The tourists will come in the summertime. The summertime, is not there. On the contrary, I was thinking, maybe I can go to shops and send them some of those things. But there are so many things that I have written. So many I have sent, so many.

Yogi: They are just some that arrived broken, not all.

Shri Mataji: Very few, very few. Very few must of arrived.

Yogi: But they are stuck with big Left Nabhi problems.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Yogi: They are stuck with big, big Left Nabhi problems. Yes. When Maria went to Portugal, they were not even having one single friend for organising the things in Portugal. They didn't have anything at all.

Shri Mataji: So they should send some of these things at least.

Yogini: They are already, the ceramic centre is already opened and there, all the four of them are living there. Two staying in the centre and two in the shop.

Shri Mataji: See, whatever is possible, we have done our level best. We have sent money there. They didn't have to pay a single dime for it. Everything we have done and the ceramics are absolutely, no doubt of it. All of them, such varieties that even you are saying, even for one, instead of that you can get Â£300. They should not be greedy.

Yogi: That's the point, Mother. To go from one extreme to another extreme.

Shri Mataji: Very few must have been broken, very few. We spent for... the whole thing I gave money for the transport, everything and all of them managed to accept it. But they are sending some money. Not now.

Yogi: Did they thank you, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Yogi: Did they thank you?

Shri Mataji: So much. They wrote very beautiful, we both thinking, I wish you could see that, beautiful. So many things, they also wrote, how we discovered the mother of the rock and so on.

Yogi: And that's amazing to see how this year, in all Europe and all the places, it grew. Along with your blessings.

Gregoire: Mother, I really think that this time, I don't know, I don't want to say this because it could be wrong.

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Gregoire: I don't think that I have the feeling of being a doer, really.

Shri Mataji: Being what?

Gregoire: A doer.

Shri Mataji: That's good.

Gregoire: I don't, I mean, honestly, I mean, I think that really I can't see.

Shri Mataji: That's a good thing. Once you get them, you're done.

Yogi: Can you explain that?

Shri Mataji: That's a great thing. Now all them you see, why I'm interested in Portugal.

Yogi: Why?

Shri Mataji: It's one thing. Portugal has been chosen by the national people who have their last sought to God.

Yogini: Yes.

Gregoire: Really?

Yogi: Lisbon.

Gregoire: Lisbon.

Yogi: They already have the candles there.

Shri Mataji: He may run where?

Gregoire: Leave Switzerland. Father, it is ready. Would you, Mum, would you like too?

Gregoire's Mum: No.

Shri Mataji: Daniel, how are you?

Daniel: Fine.

Shri Mataji: You're fine.

[UNCLEAR] 1:07:13

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR Tonight's] good. There you are. Ah, now what is it?

Yogi: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Yogi: That's the [UNCLEAR grandpa].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: Oh wait, we use, use...

Shri Mataji: We sing the mantra of Mooladhara next time.

Yogi: Usually very well, [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Yes, just take the, especially on My feet, make sure. Aum twameva sakshat.

Yogis: Aum twameva sakshat Shri Adi Shakti [UNCLEAR] Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

Aum twameva sakshat Shri Gruha Lakshmi sakshat Shri Adi Shakti sakshat Shri [UNCLEAR Bhagavati] sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

Shri Mataji: No, all right.

Yogis: Aum twameva sakshat Shri Gruha Lakshmi sakshat Shri Adi Shakti sakshat Shri [UNCLEAR Bhagavati] sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

Shri Mataji: Even now she's catching cold and moving, heats up. Then I come back. That's all.

Yogini: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Hah, may God bless you. Huh, good? [UNCLEAR]. How are you? Keep your eyes open.

Gregoire: Here I feel like a chimney without a top.

Shri Mataji: In the hand?

Yogi: I feel something in the right Mother, but not much in the left.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]. Do a bhandan in the Sahasrara. Catching. How about that?

Yogi: Yes, now I feel in the left here.

Shri Mataji: That's it.

Mathias: Does it mean Mother that we are possessed by [UNCLEAR]?

Shri Mataji: No, no, we see that chakra.

Mathias: It's not the...

Shri Mataji: Be detach, be detach. Be detach. You see how far and then you all see. Be detach, now.

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: All right?

Yogi: It is coming.

Shri Mataji: It's coming now.

Yogi: It is coming, yes Mother.

Mathias: So, my mantra, Mother, is you only God?

Yogi: No, you can.

Shri Mataji: You are the Gruha Lakshmi, you have the innocence.

Yogis: You are the Gruha Lakshmi, yes.

1:11:02

Shri Mataji: The rest of it is whatever in her is falsehood. Ah, better, improves?

Yogi: Yes, yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: What happened?

Yogi: [UNCLEAR].

[UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Hmm, doesn't matter. And what is this?

Yogini: Is this still the ashram in Bombay, for the Italian Sahaja Yogis, Mother.

Shri Mataji: It really, yes?

Yogi: Â£400.

Shri Mataji: What is this supposed to be? It's a [UNCLEAR].

Yogini: Yes, Mother you cash it in your bag.

Gregoire: I think Mother...

Shri Mataji: I can put it in there.

Yogini: Yes Shri Mataji.

Yogis: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] not in public, what I do is to take the money as it is because I put yours in the bank. That if you convert now again from the money, so can use it every time. Better take Â£1000.

Yogi: Yeah I think so.

Shri Mataji: Huh? All right.

Yogini: In this [UNCLEAR] is brand new.

Yogis: [UNCLEAR].

Yogini: Was to remain in your bank account, during the puja, the children who are behind the door and they where watching the puja and then clapping their hands and [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR].

Yogini: Yes, Mother [UNCLEAR] but I don't know.

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Yogini: I thought we could put it all together, if you have the time.

Shri Mataji: Ah but put it inside, that's in cheque or in cash?

Yogini: Cash.

Shri Mataji: Pounds, is it?

Yogini: No, it's lira.

Shri Mataji: Liras, all right. [UNCLEAR].

Yogini: I will put it all together, yes?

Shri Mataji: Yes, it's all right. May God bless you. All right. [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR].

[Dinner noises]

1:14:46

Gregoire: Very nicely.

Shri Mataji: I think there's a storm falling out isn't it.

Yogini: Yes [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] there's also five. [UNCLEAR] You see this will all be [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR] at least our attention. All right. Italians, there's nothing like. Italians are very popular, in London we want to learn. It is so easy Australian, can you imagine? Nothing [UNCLEAR], really.

[Dinner noises]

Shri Mataji: So I [UNCLEAR] did started, who [UNCLEAR]. [laughter]

Gregoire: I'm retired, oh man. [laughter]

Shri Mataji: What is [UNCLEAR]?

Yogini: But my understanding is God. When we speak it, you know exactly.

1:17:28

Shri Mataji: But the food was quite a lot in this case. Both there?

Gregoire: Yes Mother.

Shri Mataji: All of you. [UNCLEAR] What else is that?

Yogi: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: No, you can't do that. [UNCLEAR] You feel good? Stop, I don't want to do it, I want you to [UNCLEAR dry].

1:18:38

Gregoire: Do, can we, please? I don't know how to say what the protocol is Shri Mataji, [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: It is absolutely, [UNCLEAR]. It's chest pains? That's just chest. You put it.

Yogini: No.

Gregoire: Which one, Mother? Yours?

Shri Mataji: Here. It's all moving there. Yes, [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: Very good.

Yogi: [UNCLEAR].

1:19:35

Shri Mataji: I think your silver is light. It's very light. But is it rushing it?

Mathias: Yes, the first is a, I was feeling masterful [UNCLEAR], it's changing Mother. It's silver painted like.

Yogis: [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: Can't be silver.

Yogini: It can be.

Gregoire: This is silver.

Shri Mataji: I think they used, what you call it?

Yogi: Engraving, engraving.

Shri Mataji: No, no. There are two types of people into it. One is food, and I think that is why you manage, and you like it and you get it most. Another is that [UNCLEAR a lift of the sheets].

Mathias: They pull it, stamp on the mattress..

Shri Mataji: Put power in it as you can see. But this can be done better with the shins, huh? So what kind of children is making it? Searching in Portugal I have not seen anywhere, It's more India. It's more [UNCLEAR]. Portugal [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR]...more than 300?

Yogini: This one is 800. [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]...report is that England...

Yogini: It's 600. [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: It's was two years ago.

Shri Mataji: Oh it's okay. So [UNCLEAR] where was this?

Yogi: I think it was in the Bombay, Mother. Near Bombay.

Shri Mataji: Ah Bombay, yes. Maybe different I don't know.

Yogi: At same time.

Shri Mataji: Same time, this one?

Yogi: Hmm.

Shri Mataji: Same time? Same time.

Yogi: Same time.

Shri Mataji: Can you imagine? Oh this one is see, see, see. See, see, see, see. This is going to be all great.

Yogi: I think.

Shri Mataji: Ah, traumas. See that, see that. Let's see.

Yogi: Here, come on.

Shri Mataji: A little different face, eh?

Yogi: Oh?

Shri Mataji: Those are [UNCLEAR funny].

Yogi: Do things are, do things are.

Shri Mataji: See, with the one sari it's a different face, that's it. But that's it, it must be different.

Yogi: Like a girl.

Shri Mataji: You see, like a girl, I look like a girl. See like a girl.

Yogi: This is a...

Child: Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

Shri Mataji: She's walking. Sit, sit. She's putting his head on your, so good.

Yogi: I spoke to Meera, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Yogi: I spoke to Meera this morning.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Yogi: To Meera.

Shri Mataji: Ah, what did she say?

1:23:48 Yogi: Well, she's going to telephone. She'd spoken to Jamal, so she's going to telephone him and ask him about the tents.

Shri Mataji: That we can have tents, tents, yes. We can get them in Bombay, they can reserve now some good tents.

Yogi: I told her in order, to book them.

Shri Mataji: And it will be good for you, how long, you know? Don't mind the camping life.

Gregoire: No, my temper went up this morning, so... My temper went up this morning.

Shri Mataji: To what?

Yogi: It's all right.

Gregoire: No, I had a little fight with Mathias, because sometimes Mathias is very nice, but he says people, things and he told that she should not put herself too much forward. I think that... I went to left side and then I was angry.

Yogini: Is it all right, Mother?

Yogini: This is more.

Shri Mataji: What's that?

Yogini: It's the same, a little bit more. Is it all right, sweet enough?

Shri Mataji: Yes, very good.

Gregoire: Nothing important.

Mathias: Something which I really wanted to, if you have your opinion, Mother, because...

What happened yesterday...In the best intentions of mine, I talked to Ruben, I said, listen.

My problem in Geneva was that I was putting too much forward myself. I was too much of the one who was responsible and I didn't see that people didn't like it. It's not my problem, it's typical of me. What I'm trying to tell you is that I have an impression you do, you have a little bit of the same problem. So, watch because you might go so far that people, you will not realise that people have something against you. They will not tell you because you'll be afraid to tell you about it, unless something will be in trouble. And she said, 'Okay, I agree, I hear of this problem, good you told me' and everything was okay. Now, this morning, Gregoire came shouting at me, saying that I am not, that I don't know how to talk, I have no right to talk to people, who am I? I am taking myself for big Sahaja Yogi, I am not taking myself for big Sahaja Yogi, Mother. I simply told her because she is... So many people told me that I was wrong. So many people told me that I was doing things which shouldn't be done and I accepted because I know I have been doing things which were wrong. And I, maybe I said things, I, I honestly, Ruth should be here to, to, to say so, I was trying to be as, you know, as, as friendly as I could, I mean, if I may...

Shri Mataji: Where did you tell her, where did you tell her?

1:26:22

Mathias: Yesterday, Mother. And she told this morning to Gregoire, as I was, I told her this...

Shri Mataji: Yesterday.

Mathias: And Gregoire came out.

Shri Mataji: Where did you tell?

Mathias: Where?

Yogi: Where?

Matias: It was...Where?

Yogini: Here.

Mathias: And I took her to the, to the window and I said, listen, this is what I think, I would like to tell you, it's not criticising anything. It's simply letting you know about my own opinions. Maybe it's wrong maybe I'm wrong Mother, maybe I'm caught up. But I honestly did it, you know, not trying to teach anybody but to the least. If it's, if it's wrong then I'm awfully sorry for it, Mother.

Gregoire: Now, can, can the other part plead the, the case, Mother?

Shri Mataji: [Laughter] Lets.

Gregoire: Let's, let's...

Shri Mataji: Both the sides of the case.

Gregoire: Let's, let's have the other lawyer.

Shri Mataji: And it is for the judge, too.

Gregoire: Let's, let's...

Shri Mataji: Judge, come along. Ruth?

Mathias: We are talking about what happened to me.

Shri Mataji: What happened, what happened?

Gregoire: We are having a legal case because I've lost to Mathias this morning. So, what I just want to say, my case is the following. Is that...In Geneva...

Shri Mataji: No, no. Let her tell, then she'll tell the last time.

Ruth: Excuse me, Mother. May I just get my glasses, otherwise...

Shri Mataji: All right. Let's get her glasses, she can't see.

Ruth: Bless you.

Gregoire: I think it's very good that it boils because every little. So, I should wait for the judge, Mother.

Shri Mataji: No, you should wait for her to tell me and then I'll tell you what is to be done. All right?

Gregoire: Yes, Mother. But then temper is not a good advice which is it. I could have protect [UNCLEAR].

Mathias: I didn't say anything, so I...

Shri Mataji: All right, let her explain. What happened exactly?

Mathias: No.

Shri Mataji: Let her explain. Now, you just...Tell her. Tell me. What happened?

Ruth: Yesterday?

Mathias: Yup.

Ruth: Okay. So, after the push, there weren't...

Shri Mataji: Loudly.

Ruth: Sorry. Matthias came to me and he was very nice in saying and he said, okay, let me talk to you. The brother talks to his sister and you should be careful. I know this in you because I am the same type of person. You should be careful because you go too much forward. And you try too much to...

1:28:46

Mathias: Not that you go, I think you go. Not that you do it. I mean, just that if I think it.

Shri Mataji: Oh, that's what it is, huh? So?

Ruth: And then, I said 'Mathias, did you ask me, did you tell me that because of the puja of this morning? Because in fact, yes, I was active this morning in the puja'. And he said, 'No, no, no, not at all because of this morning in general or I had already noticed this before'. So...And then he told me the thing about Gregoire.

Gregoire: What did he?

Shri Mataji: What did he say?

Ruth: He said that Gregoire had a tendency to feel too responsible and that this was no reason that he had two [UNCLEAR] and he was getting rightly shoot because he had a tendency to feel too responsible and that I should not do like that. And, of course, I did not begin arguing and I thought maybe I did not see myself very well. So I said nothing and then I thought, oh, and he said also that I should be careful because the Italian would resent me. If I went all the ways forward and that they would feel uncomfortable that they would not tell me anything. But then they would be kind of against me and I was not giving them the chance of taking self-confidence towards you or towards all Sahaja yogis. And so this is it and then I thought about it, of course and I felt no more confident because I thought I was going too well short.

Shri MatajI: Now, if you stop crying and understand, it's very simple to understand, you see. You people don't know that you are realised souls, you are saints, you see. And once you are saints, you see, if you find wrong with somebody else then you should behave like saints and not like ordinary people, in the sense there is nothing to talk about. Supposing you find too much of anything in her or in anyone, all right, your concern is correct. Should be there because we want Sahaja Yoga to go forward and there should not be any aggression by us and in a way it should be sweet that people should feel that they are very sweet and loving and compassionate, all that is all right. But to talk about it is wrong. There's no need to talk for us. We have got vibrations. We have to correct everybody by vibration. There's no need to talk or discuss or talk. You see, the talking is the mistake. Talking is the mistake because then you go to the level again from where you have come. This is the big problem. We forget we are saints, we have vibrations, we forget. We never use our vibrations. What we use is something else which is not going to help us.

I'll give you a case of Terrence, you see. Terrence went there and to India and he, in good meaning, is good intention. What he said was true also but we just burnt it out, you see. Because we are used to that kind of thing, you see. I'll find in the West especially people are very, very good to each other. They can win, they are very sporting. They can take it also from others. But in India he went and he said something and people were just frightened, you know. They thought like he just jumped on them like a lion, you see. They felt horrible. They are so diffident down. Absolutely they are just, they don't know. They think they cannot do anything. They are good for nothing, all that has happened. Now he didn't mean anything bad, they didn't mean anything bad but the main thing we forget that we are realised souls. We should take ourselves as saints. First of all we are all saints. Take that confidence in yourself, you are all saints. Of course saints sometimes have true assert. Your Mother has also to assert. But just now I was telling her that never you'll find my finger straight like this, I do but little bent always. In my action also I am never like this, you see, I am like this. I never say like that something, sentence or anything. So when you talk to people or anyone, you have to be curbed. There has to be the sweetness about it. You have to talk like that and do it. Now correcting each other is also a thing when our attention is more towards others than ourselves. It is true, that is so. But that is important because if you have to see to the whole system, you have to see to everyone of us if there's anything lacking and all that. But it is not so much the outward vibrations or outward behaviour that's important. It's an inner thing, you see, how sincere a person is.

1:33:37

The person supposing who has told you, say, take it like this. Now somebody tells Me about you, to Me. I won't bother as to what that person has to say. I do not take it for granted, I don't believe that person, I don't listen to that person. What, as a saint, I will see that. That's the one brings out the sickness. So I will see that what is, what is he? Nothing, invalidation in character, even chakras. Is he like that? In this thing, if he's like a world, why is he? This is to be done. To criticise others is the best way to kill every organisation. I think that's the worst thing that is the against Sahaj. Should not I've told you that you have to be extremely loving and respectful to your certainty. That is worth definitely what Mathias believe in it. You have to be extremely loving and kind. To begin, there is no need to correct, no need to shout, no need to fight, nothing.

Mathias: I thought I did it yesterday, Mother.

Shri Mataji: That's what you did, to correct. And today he did, what he did was also wrong, to shout at you. See, what I am saying, he should have told Me, I would have handled the situation. Now this correction business is up to the point goes that you should not do it, is to correct the vibrations of others, directly. Even that much is prohibited in Sahaja Yoga, that you try to correct his vibrations, correct his vibrations, give a balance. [UNCLEAR Chavan, Chavan!] Just think of a Chavan. He was such a responsible Sahaja yogi. He used to have a session where they used to correct each other's vibrations and as a result, consequence, they got all the weaknesses of everyone distributing.

Gregoire: Mother, as I am out of the tree, I am the one who could not put my case. Mother, I take my ears because I shouldn't have shouted and I made a mistake this morning. So I ask forgiveness to Yourself and to Mathias. But what I noticed is that Mathias has always had the extremely great quality of listening to people and has always been very sweet which has always been remarkable for this category of person and I cherish him for this. What I have noticed since the few last times where I have seen him, is that he has started this business of saying this is not okay and this is not okay. And my worry, out of my concern for him, is that it is something that he has picked up from his wife. That's why this time I reacted strongly. He did the same thing to me in Geneva, coming towards me saying that I put myself too much forward and this. Which may be true. You told me this in Geneva. Which may be true, but the way he did it make me feel uncomfortable. If it didn't feel quite all right, and I don't know why. Maybe my ego resented maybe also he didn't do it in the right way. I think if Dumal would tell me something or someone else, I think I would have no problem to accept it. But I didn't feel happy in Geneva. Now, I know the background of Ruth, Mother is someone who is basically on the, well, I mean, I can't say I know, but she's someone who goes into this lack of confidence steadily and so on. And I don't think that she has the kind of attitude which was criticised. So, I came out on Mathias. 1:37:19

Shri Mataji: No, no, nobody criticised each other. With the mouth.

Gregoire: Because I thought it was.

Shri Mataji: With the mouth.

Gregoire: With the mouth.

Shri Mataji: With the vibrations you correct, you work, you work on the person.

Mathias: Okay.

Shri Mataji: All right? You work on the person. Say you find something wrong, work on that person then you will improve and that person will improve. Work on that person, so your vibrations will improve, you see, sharpness will improve. That is done in compassion. You see, look at me. I work on you, work very hard. You see, if I was to criticise you, where would you have been? Just tell me, no [UNCLEAR].

Mathias: Yes, Mother, absolutely. I mean, I'm not arguing this.

Shri Mataji: All right and about Susan, I must tell you that she's much better now. She's not to be so much right and wrong. You have to be careful but yes, you have to be very careful because you see, how I judged her best was through another third, that was her issues, her intelligent power. She got very friendly with my... What you call it? Niece, her niece-in-law, very friendly. She used to talk to another. And Harish warned me that she's talking against everyone in a very subtle way, it's very intelligent.

Gregoire: The truth I'm afraid of...

Mathias: Yeah well I'm...

Shri Mataji: You see, just I'll tell you what, this is what she told Me, absolutely, he told Me and he said, be very careful. It is he who pointed out, he said 'She's a nice lady of the people but that's what my mother does', he said, you see. But she does it in a very gross way, but she, this one is very subtle and I, I just discouraged my wife, all true. Though she said, you see, she said, she's been, she's, he told her, I don't listen to all these talks, no? All the time when this girl was there, Susan was and she, she's left.

Mathias: Mother, I have taken so much criticism from Gregoire and from Arno, from anybody. They have given me so much, you know, information. I wouldn't have changed, if I had this information.

Shri Mataji: They should not, they should not be.

Mathias: And you know, and I accepted it, it was normal. I didn't...

Shri Mataji: No, no, they should not do. That, that it is wrong in whether it is, to Me, you are all just saying My children, all right?

Mathias: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So, if you do it or he does it or she does it, or he does it, it's all wrong.

You should never, never, never criticize each other.

Gregoire: But then, this is not true, Mother. This is not true, I have never criticized much.

Mathias: Yes, you are saying things which I told you the same thing.

Gregoire: It's different, this is not true.

Mathias: I didn't criticise you, Gregoire. I told you the same.

Shri Mataji: Now, only place where you have to criticise or anything, you should write to Me. That's the best way, tell Me. You'll bring it to My attention, I'll work it out. You see, in case where it is serious, you see, nothing is serious. For example, you see, we start taking mostly the people who grudge about Sahaja Yogis. Mostly the people who grudge about Sahaja Yogis to you or to anybody who, so say you are the leader, say. Anyone who grudges you against this thing, thank God. Are you happy now?

Yogini: Yes, very happy now Mataji. Thank you.

Shri Mataji: May God bless.

Yogini: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: Give my love to all of that.

Yogini: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR Hot chapla.]

Yogini: Yes.

Mathias: Bye-bye.

Yogi: Bye-bye.

Shri Mataji: So, one thing is definite, whether it is you or him. Nobody should criticise, that's one point is we are Sahaja Yogis. You can criticise others. They are another place, we are another place, we are another people, they are another people, we have nothing to do. They are nothing to us. Even if you beat them, I will not say. But with each other? Now, when it comes to the spreading of Sahaja Yogis, naturally it comes to this point, that one has to talk to people in such a way that it should be soft. You should be kind, you should be humble but to a point, too a point, you see. You can't go on with them all the time, also like the other day one lady got up and said,'Why do you want to tell about Christ in your Indian way?'. Who is she who asked me such a question? So I asked her, who are you? You see, I have to sometimes. You see, this fellow yesterday with their Bhopi Krishna, he was breathing the same. You see, they are not realised souls, you know. That's the main thing is, they are to be at our feet. That's what it is. Actually believe but we should not say that you are at our feet. Say, our servants also, if you treat them like servants, they will misbehave. So you must tell them, you know, how to treat them but in no way they should feel that they are wanted too much and that we can complete too much. That's the one thing they do, no matter what happens. Once you tell them that you don't have to do it yourself, they'll come up better. If you tell them you want them or you want to have them there, you see, then they start thinking, oh, you are very great and really and we are obliging them by being there and all that. So in Sahaja Yoga we have two forces, as I said, sent to [UNCLEAR] and sent to [UNCLEAR]. By one force we are trying, by one other force we throw them out. There are two forces all the time. People can go just out of their way. Now you give it to Me, if there is any, I know each and every one of you, because you are part and parcel of My country. Even if there is a slightest pain, I know where what is happening. So if something has gone wrong with any one of you, of course you should try to help them in Sahaja Yoga manner. At the most you can bring it to My attention also. But I work it out so well, you don't know, the organisation is so efficient, that person either goes out or exposed or finished, you see, or corrected. All right?

So then, because, you know, this is more sort of a household sort of a thing, I feel, that when we are sitting down, we are talking to each other about these things and all that. It's like, you see, we make much more, not that, talk of big things, talk of the whole emancipation of the world. What we can do, all those things, don't talk of these things. It's big, small, small, small, small, small. You are all great, you are all realised souls, you see. Not only realised souls but you are Sahaja Yogis, means you know how to be realised. You have been given realisation by Adi Shakti Herself. You must know that, not by an ordinary person. And then what happens is from the propagation point of view, I must say, that Fati has a much more sense of publicity. That one must understand. Like last time when he was working it out. You see, people opposed him for nothing at all, that was very wrong, to make him look small and all that. In that point you people made a mistake. You see, when he is expanding it, expansive person must be always respected in such a way, always respected. Nobody should criticize anybody for expansion and Ruth has done the same!

Mathias: Mother, I'm sorry. 1:44:41

Shri Mataji: But for her, Rome would not have been established. I know she was dominating a little bit, I just knew that. She was dominating on others, I know that but that was needed, very much needed. I would have tested her. I have seen her through and through. See, I saw there was big fight between [UNCLEAR Flabia] and Ruth. I know that.

Yogini: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: This fellow has written horrible things about him, no doubt but he doesn't know how it happens. Now we are thinking of sending him all the way he does it, how he does it. And how he works it out and what is his style he is. Everything we can write. You see, to him, in details but I just thought of the fellow, he is against Mahesh yogi in a way. He has beaten Mahesh yogi, he is the third person. We are talking Sahaja Yoga, you see. So he can write about Mahesh yogi if he is willing to say it because we will supply all the other things. And then he can send it to this fellow Mother, the one who has published this article.

Gregoire: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: By the way, you got this article or Brian got it? Brian. This article from him. And he doesn't know how he gets the money and all that. So this will cover up but I would not like Brian to do it, or Remo to do it, or Remo can do it. Remo can do it because Remo is from Switzerland and he can do it because he is Swiss, Switzerland. And he can send to in the name of Remo.

Mathias: Yes but it has to be written by us, Mother.

Shri Mataji: We write the whole thing. We give him all the documents of the thing. We get people who have to talk about it.

Yogi: Because, Mother, yes, I wanted to stress this thing. After you went, after you left Geneva. Antoinette explained to me and Mathias too that there was a very strong activity of TM. Advertising publicity in Geneva and especially in the university with tremendous big posters and big articles, huge articles from the same newspaper as La Suisse, which was a bit negative towards us. And, I mean, the feeling that... They knew that we had a very successful time in Geneva. They wanted really, I had the feeling to attack back.

Shri Mataji: No, no, they are in a very big mess according to this article.

Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Could I show you, Gregoire, what I mean? You see, can you have my [UNCLEAR]?

Yogi: Yes, I think it's a flower you have to put it back in the room.

Gregoire: I can contact this Hokusic, let's see how we write about us on Tuesday.

Shri Mataji: If he can write something what he knows about us. That can be also accounted for, you see, we put one of his names, Linda's names, and he can write what they are doing.

Mathias: May I suggest, Mother, that maybe Gregoire calls him, the office today. Just to see whether he has got any other questions which he would like to have answered. Because when you write an article, you might have another question which you would like to have answered. Just as to make sure that he doesn't feel afraid of calling us, that You may still act and correct him.

1:48:14

Shri Mataji: Maybe, now you have done the first trick very good that you didn't show that you want him, it is he who has to come. And now if you talk to him, he'll be good at it, he'll be happy. But you say, you just talk to him.

Gregoire: We worked on him yesterday.

Shri Mataji: Yes, sir. Eh?

Gregoire: We worked on him yesterday, a little bit, and he said...

Shri Mataji: No, he said, how are you now, I'm very happy. If he has to ask any questions, let him ask. But we need not say if you have any questions like that.

Mathias: No.

Shri Mataji: Because, you see, again, it's the same thing, you know. First he has gone through lots of things. Now this is the one. As Maheshri yogi, Mahesh yogi makes his preliminary move to permanently return to India, his various organisation, all right,

they get curious and...

Gregoire: Curiouser, more and more strange.

Yogi: Ah.

Shri Mataji: They are buying up land all over the country at a fantastic pace and what is most significant, this land is really a strategic and ministry important thing. So it's very simple to understand, you see, he wants to establish his own being down.

Yogi: Come, sir.

1:49:39

Shri Mataji: You see, first what he's doing, he's making all the brambles, you see, do this thing, you see. So that they become absolutely characters, all the brambles, you see. It's a kind of domination he wants to have, you know because he's employed all banks, no, I will put ice, I don't know what it is. But he's employed [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR] means the people who live in the body, you see, the people who are more interested in the material. You see, they're more intelligent people, very intelligent and people who are at least dangerous and all. And Indra Gandhi has run them down for a few years. Now here's the idea, please, to sort...

Gregoire: Take the chaos first.

Shri Mataji: Finish all the brambles of India by making them, take them, mining them, take them, take them. [UNCLEAR] come like that because if there's people they can have fight back and then to establish his own kingdom. Of course, he's taking use of some, some [UNCLEAR] in there. They say the mind behind you is taking out, I don't know what to say that at all. But that's what they say. He's the mind behind you. It's not said here, but it's said by many people, you see. Now what he's trying to achieve now, his brother, [UNCLEAR], they are all relations of Srivastava and they are very cunning people according to this and they are the ones who are getting jobs with him and he's giving them jobs. The [UNCLEAR], he's mentioned here absolutely, the [UNCLEAR] and he's after the pundits, you see, gives them money and...

There's a brother, J.P. Srivastava, the sister in Neera and there are all the brothers, sisters, everybody are there helping him. And they spend money like this and his, I mean, they are not educated people and they are so much and all that is with Me, yes. And the [UNCLEAR] are coming to teach the Maheshri yogis -Maharishi lords, is in evidence everywhere. Many of the employees belong to it. However, nobody really knows what the other person or relating is to. They maintain a secret, even the auditors are different, say the former employee of the organisation. Nor does anyone stay in a senior position long ago to get to know all the secrets.

What happened? 1:52:30

This is how they talk, the organisation, financial working are a mystery. Even to those who have been involved in some of the commercial projects, say the form of consumption. I really don't know what happens, it is humanly impossible to generate so much money even in 20 years. And what he does? For his money, they don't know. But like way he did it to Peter, Peter's wife had brought up money. Peter had a lot of money. The first, he started organising trips for himself and his wife and his child and all that. When he was all done then he said, 'He would buy a house, and I make an academy, for all students'. First, we were there, he paid them for their food, their children and all that. Like that. Second time they went there, they paid for. Then they asked him to break all the money from London, to smuggle him, which is there because he was not allowing those things to carry the money, so he had to do it. And he had to do all the things, he used to tell lies, things that he did everything. But in the fourth year, they started reducing the amount of money that was due. Like that they went down, 'Oh, we'll pay later on', this thing like that. And they never wrote any letters, only on the telephone. These people should have recorded. And like that and by that end, it was last three or four years, they never paid a single file. Last three, four years, and whatever was remaining from the first, they didn't pay. So that's how they became bankrupt. They became completely bankrupt, they had to pay people who were around and when the house was sold, most of it was paid to the people who were to be paid for this. And so they were left with very little money and filled with [UNCLEAR]. All that money was lost. These people, apart from that whatever money they had put in, labour, they had put in, anything they had done, all that was lost, you see. So they took over. Now when they put a case against them, these people bribed their judges out there because in Scotland, you can bribed their judges.

Mathias: Scotland? 1:54:50

Shri Mataji: Scotland, horrible judges there. They were bribed and what happened and that's how the whole case was dropped, without even understanding, what a... This is how. Now, how they get money like this? You see, if you completely exhaust the person. Now, the second thing is that, they are like a moving roller. Now, if they have taken money from India, [UNCLEAR] then they are finished. Then take another, then take another, like a rolling thing there. And they go on like having more and more people richer and richer people and making them poorer and poorer. And this Linda and all these girls, you see, like, there's one girl from the bank, you see. She became mad and all that. And she had given them money, with the, she had lent him a money through bank, so he returned the money. And she's telling everybody, no, no, he returned my money, he returned my money. But she has, she's a mad woman, she's become a mad woman. So, it is what he is doing is to keep a, no, nothing on file, nothing to write, he just takes money from people, nobody has any receipts or anything. You have to send the money to him. He takes all the money and the persons who really do the job, do not let. Say, for example, now there's an academic here. They have to look after the people who come and say, say, about hundred people go to the academy. Give them their food and all that is to be paid by him at least minimum that also he does. Till these people are completely sunk, you see. Then he gets another one, makes him the director and he says now what was Peter, was that? He was not educated, nothing of the kind so he made him a, what is happened?

1:56:48

Gregoire: No, I, pain in the neck here but maybe it is what you are talking about, I don't know.

Shri Mataji: So, you see, that's how he's making his money, is to get new people, completely make them bankrupt. Take their own money, then take another, take another one like that is going on. And somehow or other, it never gets connected. You see, people don't know about it. For example, this happened to Gilda and before she could write to anyone, say, the [UNCLEAR] saying that she's gone out of it, she's mad. And they have nothing in writing also.

Yogi: Very clever.

Shri Mataji: He's been very sensitive but he has shown that all the ordinal factories in India, wherever they are strategic point. You see, this one, here, everywhere, there's taken, these are all very strategic places. Now somebody told me that [UNCLEAR] was a defensive secretary and he knows all the secrets.

Mathias: Yes.

Shri Mataji: She's one who has given Me the secrets about him.

Yogi: That's true, he's a defensive secretary.

Shri Mataji: He was a defensive secretary. Who [UNCLEAR]?

Gregoire: Oh under or...

Yogi: He is in TM?

Gregoire: Yeah.

Shri Mataji: I was sitting [UNCLEAR] the other day but this is the condition of it.

Gregoire: And this, Mother, Mother but do you think he wants to establish his kingdom in India? An actual kingdom? He needs people for that. Only with money, you cannot do it.

Mathias: You can bring all westerners.

Shri Mataji: Yes, people are developing. You see, what he's trying to do is to get, pay people to do that.

Gregoire: How is he health-wise?

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Gregoire: How is he health-wise?

Shri Mataji: Very bad. When [UNCLEAR Indira] used to put down her foot, she said, 'We will not allow him to come here, whatever'. CIA is after him and also our intelligence is after him. We have to write our intelligence also about him. And the industry, he's trying to show that he's putting the money in the industry, you see. Because he wants to show that he's trying to help him get double wedge, you see, so that people start. But all the industries are having losses. He's got a huge plot of land with lots of foreigners are staying and there are so many cows, he's just been 11 meters of milk. All the trees go absolutely sink down, there's no greenery nothing, all the vegetables get rotten, all sorts of things happen that no one knows how. That's all, you see.

Yogi: Yeah, yeah I'm waitering. The cheek of the [UNCLEAR Goddess].

Gregoire: Yes, I will maybe if you allow me. I will photocopy this and send it back to you in London and send you one copy.

Shri Mataji: No, I'll say that yes, you can photocopy but we have photocopies of this in London, I think. Brian has got it so we not need.

Yogi: Indira Gandhi is against this man?

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogi: Your Prime Minister is against, Maheshwari, Indira Gandhi?

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Yogi: Indira Gandhi is against this man?

Shri Mataji: He is against.

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Very much. And she doesn't want him to come down. But somebody has to write to the intelligence in England at what he's doing is like this. That's how he gets the money. See?

Yogi: But it was the same with, I read an article, it was the same with Vajnish in the United States.

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Yogi: He wanted to, to emphasize that the government was so good and that he was a strong anti-communist. And so that Reagan who is a stupid fellow, absolutely was pleased with him because he...

Shri Mataji: Who? 2:00:40

Yogi: Reagan, the President of the United States. Accepted to hear the Rajneesh organization in the United States because the Rajneesh was...

Shri Mataji: Rajneesh tried this trick with...

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: First, you see, he opposed... The only person who saw through his game was our former Prime Minister, was this Morarji Desai. So he got after Rajneesh but when he got after Rajneesh, you see. Rajneesh tried to tell, you see, the whole place my eyes these things happened. And Indira, you see, with the person who was supported by Rajneesh. Really, see, he tried those tricks with her. And she was quite convinced but it became so hot that she had to leave. Now this is another fellow. Now, she's against Maheshwati. And, you see, these people, these people went here, they came here, these ministers of Muradji Desai, you see. We have to call them Janata Raj. And when they came here, he bestowed some titles on them and all that. And as a result they lost the elections. Janata Raj.

Mathias: Did Rajneesh support Indira Gandhi because of her anti-conception policy, policy of sterilisation of women and getting...

Shri Mataji: He had no policy, he had no principles. He just supported her because he thought that opposing her would be too difficult. They have no principles, I tell you.

Gregoire: Mother, did you say that Rajneesh is dead?

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Gregoire: Did you say Rajneesh...

Shri Mataji: No, I don't say that but I don't know about these, you see, these Rakshasas. But what people are saying in India that Rajneesh was killed long time back. And the fellow who has come as Rajneesh is his own younger brother who looks very much like him and who is no good also he is not so good at things. So, they said, he's got a paralysis and all that. They bound him because by that you cannot see the face of a person, you see. And they took him out of India and there they found that nothing was wrong with him, you see, as such. So, the government said that now you better go back, there's nothing wrong with him, you are perfect boy, you are cured. So, they said that yes, he got cured because of his divine powers and all that. There's an article about him like that in India. That he was the man who was taken away by these people, just to use him. And now they are using him because he doesn't talk much. And just they are impressed that he's steward and people are paying a lot of fantastic money to him. Now the price is much more. It's Â£4500.

Yogini: How many? 2:03:41

Shri Mataji: Per week, per week.

Mathias: What? What do they do?

Shri Mataji: Per week, they are paying in that place.

Yogis: In the United States? In Oregon?

Shri Mataji: It now becomes a term for being localised, localised.

Yogi: Yes, in the United States, in the place. In Oregon.

Yogi: In Oregon.

Mathias: Mother, what do they do for this Â£4000? What do they give them?What do they do then?

Shri Mataji: Just to jump, take out your clothes. For taking out your clothes and jumping, you are charged Â£4500.

Yogis: Hmm. Hmm. 2:04:19

Gregoire: Mother, it's madness.

Shri Mataji: What to do. With people are so stupid, what can you do?

Yogi: But people are beginning to see that they are fake Mother.

Shri Mataji: Just a problem with ego is so stupid, you know? That if you talk to someone, they say that 'No, no the other fellow get it that's why he's still in all the things, here you are going to get it. You are getting the powers of flight [UNCLEAR] and all this'. So stupid.

Mathias: During the program in Lausanne there was one girl from Rajneesh who was shaking. She was just going back with it. And I told her to take off her medallion. She wouldn't do this.

Shri Mataji: No, this is a sense of security for them because they can directly go to hell.

Like a dog's collar.

Mathias: Even the argument, if she worked on me, I wouldn't shake in front of her but she shakes in front of me, wouldn't be good enough.

Shri Mataji: If they think they have power, more power, that's why they are shaking. You see, if they shake, according to them it's a great power. What can you do? If they feel hated, they say it's the real power.

Yogi: But Mother, all these people, they must feel that they are about to be destroyed now. They must feel because if they understand in the awareness that they must... Do they understand that they are Rakshasa or not?

Shri Mataji: You see, the best thing is about ego that you never know what you are doing. Ego is something, such a cloudy thing, it's such a horrible thing you don't know. At least with left side, you see, the thing is you get the bangs and the pains and the things but with the right side, such people go on and on. They can be fooled you, they can take off...

Gregoire: Mother, sorry this is the greatest thing. You see, where there is money, there is tension. Where there is tension, dhyana is needed.

Yogi: Dhyana.

Shri Mataji: And dhyana is this bhoot in here.

Gregoire: This bhoot in here. There it is, they don't dare to say, where there is money, meditation is needed. Or they say, where there is money, there is tension, where there is tension, meditation is needed.

Shri Mataji: And the tension is never reduced, you see, in this... never.

Yogi: Well, it's like a mother, it's like this boy last night, no? He has read books of... what is his name?

Shri Mataji: Gobi, Krishna.

Yogi: I did... also before I hear you talk about Kundalini, I have read one of his books, no? And I was afraid of what he was saying about Kundalini, that I would have never... I thought to myself, well, I cannot work that, it's too dangerous to work on Kundalini.

Shri Mataji: That's what they have done. That's another way of hurting others. You see, but he went out and he was waiting for others to come and tell him what happened to them. And now I think he will be confident. That fat lady also became confident now. I think he's calm, but he's took it cool, you know, he's trying to want people and things like that.

Yogi: And he was dressed in black, a very...

Shri Mataji: Always darker.

Yogi: Yeah, negative, yeah.

Shri Mataji: No glorious views. Now what about the little baby? Can I give him a massage?

Yogini: Oh yes, of course.

Shri Mataji: What oil?

Yogini: We have olive oil we are using in the kitchen.

Shri Mataji: Little, little heat it up.

Yogini: Little heat it up, yes I'll prepare.

Shri Mataji: And bring it up.

Gregoire: But Mother, for this afternoon interview with the radio, maybe we can go three with You or two with You. I would come also, but then, if there is anything...

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, better not. It's better not. It's the award, I guess.

Gregoire: Yes, maybe but I was thinking that Mathias and Arno could accompany you there. Maybe I should just come with You until You are in the studio, kind of bringing you there. If there is a... Because I called from the Swiss machine and I said I was from the Swiss machine. I said all that because all I said I would not take it, you see. So, I mean, let's at least this job have some use, you know.

Shri Mataji: You should take my brother, you see.

Gregoire: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: It's my brother who's done.

Gregoire: No problem. I mean, I have to go ahead with it. I mean, after all...I mean, there is nothing...There is nothing disgraceful. What I...

Shri Mataji: I think we are the only secular state here.

Gregoire: Secular?

Shri Mataji: Indians are the only secular state in the real society. Secular means they do not allow any religion to dominate. Any kind to dominate, any is going to dominate, really. You are the only real secular state, you know. You see, the Pakistanis and all that are upset, you open with that. You all are, even Englandese.

Gregoire: With the Church of England, you're right. Everybody is there. Yes, that's true, Mother. And also communist countries, the communistness religion.

Shri Mataji: Oh, there's no question, there's no question but those who are so-called democratic, you know. You are the only secular state. Only. Even in America, it's quite dominated by so many other things. Like, you cannot cure anyone because the doctors...for him to do that.

Gregoire: That's good to be the way.

Shri Mataji: The family was [UNCLEAR]. So now, should I try the baby? Is she bringing it?

Yogi: Yes.

Gregoire: You have made the baby?

Yogi: No, no, we need it.

Yogi: No, no, ah. [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: So give him these papers to read, you see? And see what he can do about it and he should also write.

Yogi: Yes, that's right.

Shri Mataji: What happened?

Yogi: She's bringing the oil, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Who is troubling you? Who is troubling you?

Yogi: She's having a little smile.

Shri Mataji: Oh very happy with that. Ah? Oh, oh! Ah! Ah! You see all ways a little bit before the ankles [UNCLEAR] for the father [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: I have the easy job, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Yeah.

Yogini: Here? Should I? Oh, where? Where? Where are you warm?

Shri Mataji: It's all right, it is as warm as that one.

Yogini: No, here is warmer because we have opened the window there.

Shri Mataji: Oh right, this is warmer. Can you spread the towel here?

Yogini: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Come along, sir. Come on.

Yogini: Shri Mataji...

Shri Mataji: It's only sufficient, such a big body.

2:12:16

Gregoire: You know, Mother, another point is my mother's standing is very near from where Yogi Mahesh.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR].

Gregoire: My uncle, Bridget's family, he's very near the place where he is, Lake of Leucine,

that's where they live. Very near.

Shri Mataji: There's a group [UNCLEAR Salah.]

Yogi: What's wrong?

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR]... London.

Gregoire: Mother, this is again, I love my brother and sisters in London but I have asked them to bring cassettes here. So I would have the last cassettes in London.

Shri Mataji: Who came from where?

Yogini: No...

Gregoire: But it was too late, or?

Yogini: No, yes, it was also. I said that I gave all the tape to Anna and Mariana and Maria.

Gregoire: But it does not come yet to...

Shri Mataji: Who? Who?

Yogini: No because you see Mother, normally I am duplicating for Switzerland, Rome and Austria when I can. But there were also so many things together that at the end, I brought them to Arno and Marie-Amelia. But we didn't have time to bring them to Gregoire. But you will have them.

Gregoire: But they are duplicating machines it's better if you do it directly from London instead of doing it through you and through Arno and Maria.

Yogini: Yes I will do.

Shri Mataji: No, I'll tell you what to do with [UNCLEAR]. They are not informed and I'm also not. First you see the English wanted to come here you see they were thinking of taking a big van go up to Belgium and drive it down here. Because to carry this video was a very big problem. How to carry it here and the puja things so puja things were definitely important so they gave it to. When I told you can't come there would be the planes when you stay there would be a problem now. So they decided all right we cancel not going so give all the puja things to Terence. And Terence because he was coming by train he could bring it. So he brought it by train, the video set and all that was to be brought. And Rustom decided, I asked Rustom to come with Me so they asked Rustom but it was too much to carry for one person. And he wanted also to carry My luggage but I said I'll carry mine, you just don't worry. I had that empty one, the empty one I gave you and the one was my vanity case which was not so difficult. So they said that they wanted to send other things also, no doubt. And the problem is you see, they got that you must remember precisely about what takes to what. What's in your being that these ten sustenances of the human beings which are within us. You see, when you go out in one of them you see, in anyway then what happens that. That starts looking on the void first of all you see, like your guru tattwa is wrong or something like that. But when you start becoming cunning about it. You see, mentally then it starts accumulating on the right hand side if it accumulates that means you are playing into the hands of the negative side. But if it accumulates on the right hand side then in your activity you are trying to. You see it is always built in when you start working anti-God, you know it's anti-God. In any way you see, anti-God is a very subtle and a very vast thing. But one wants to understand that knowing if you anti-God, Ekadesha is...

Mathias: Coming?

Shri Mataji:...Knowing. Another thing is if you bow before someone who is not an incarnation

that's why it is said that you are not to bow to anyone. Or who is not authorised like your parents, you can bow, you can touch the feet whatever is the custom you see, whatever is accepted, collectively is all right. But if you go on bond with a guru or someone like that there are no incarnations of this, very few incarnations. They are not seeing it. You see, so Ekadesha Rudra has a double face because it's the Agnya. Agnya is the one which throws them on the side. So it is a double faced one, one is here and one works at the back you see, it's like that. The left side works on the back and the other works on the front but the effect comes up here. Then if on that if you do that also this is the ten. We can say of course these are not only those ten because they are represented another way because you can say that is the Gabriel is there, [UNCLEAR] is there, Ganesha is there as Christ you see. All these eleven people they go and they all represent those eleven people but the worst is when this happens, this is the Vishuddhi. When you start doing this work against God on the back.

Yogi: On?

Gregoire: On the Virat.

Shri Mataji: Then it forms a very and all these gurus have got this. [UNCLEAR]... they start in the worst possible, worst possible when you not know how to exist even for a medic, we had. Cancer is one of the diseases which is anyhow and people develop it, can develop it with only a few a Ekadesha's. If the whole balance formed. Say if you are living with a woman, I must tell you this is very important. Who is being who is a clairvoyant, you see. She is a Ekadesha completely no thing is built in in her but even the husband, might be a Ekadesha Rudhra.

Gregoire: Mother, Christ, God, crown of thorns on a Ekadesha Rudhra, what did it mean?

Shri Mataji: What is it?

Gregoire: When, when Christ was brought to the cross. They brought him a crown of thorns

on the Ekadesha Rudhra, here. What?

Shri Mataji: You see all his powers are there so it's an anti-Christ activity, you see. To put the

it was to make a very subtle way you see, their subconscious promoted them that you put there, you see to insult them. Insult those powers.

Gregoire: Insult those powers, and he did not?

Shri Mataji: Because he said he was the king so they said he has those powers he adores, you see. When you give me you adorn my powers all these things, are adorning my powers

these things, are adorning my powers here. All these are adorning my powers you see, of the feet, all these adorning the chakras, for that you see in the waist and here also everything and the adornment. But actually what happens is that. That in the subconscious people get these ideas perhaps or maybe from unconscious or unconscious cannot be bad ideas. But we can get the subconscious and the collective subconscious gives them such ideas how to insult inside you. How to insult a saint and also how to insult every kind...
