Time: 53:00:00 till 2:16:00

I bow to all the seekers of Truth. At the very outset I have to say that truth is what it is. (You have to say, I have to say, the truth is what it is. Bring her closer, it will be better). You cannot change it, you cannot conceptualize it. Also unfortunately at this human awareness you cannot know it. Otherwise if we had known the truth, there would have been no problems. All the worlds’ problem come to us through human beings and all human problems come to us from these centers going into problems. So whatever I am going to tell you today you are not to believe it blindfolded. We have had enough trouble with blind faiths but keep your minds open like a scientist. Read my talk as a hypothesis but if it is proved then as honest people you have to accept it because it is for your own benevolence. It is for the benevolence of your society, your country and for the benevolence of the whole world at large. The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this intellect. You are not this ego, you are not this, these conditionings. But you are the pure spirit. You see here beautiful flowers and we take them for granted. This is a miracle but we don’t think about them. Who runs our heart, the doctors will say it is autonomous nervous system. But who is this auto? (Who is this auto, auto, like automobile. We never think about it. We cannot explain the living process. So we have to now understand that we have no knowledge about ourselves. That is the reason why Buddha and Mahavira both didn’t want to talk about God. They just wanted to talk about the self, the spirit and about this all-pervading power of this Divine love, which does all the living work. Thus we have to know there is a all-pervading power. It’s not only Buddha, many others like Guru Nanaka, many others who talked of a formless energy. It is like this that if you talk about the flowers, about the deities, people start worshipping the flowers but if you have to get to the essence of the flowers which is the nectar, which is the honey they thought it’s better to talk about the honey. (It is to, they thought it is better to talk about the honey which is the essence of the flowers). But even talking about honey became a talk. Somehow talking about the form or the formless just became a talk. So to get to the honey you have to be a bee. Then they did all talk about self-realization. (They did talk about self-realization). All of them talked about your second birth, (All of them talked about their second birth) and that is what we are here for. This is not just going to be a talk or a sermon, by a spontaneous happening within you, you will become the Spirit. This is what is very important. As you have known that there is a power within us, which can give you your self-realization. It has to happen. It’s not going to be just a talk. As soon as you become the spirit, you start getting your self-knowledge. On your fingertips you can feel your own centers, this is what it is to be Buddha. (This is what it is to be Buddha) to know on your central nervous system. Not just mental but it is actualization of this happening. So this is your own power and when it is awakened so many of your powers start manifesting. When this kundalini passes through six centers, she nourishes all of them and also enlightens them. So that you get your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems completely solved. We have in Delhi 4 doctors who have got their M.D in Sahaja yoga. There are many people who suffered from mental problems, have been cured. Apart from that you become the source of peace. We become the peace within and peace without and you become the witness of the whole play. You may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist but you can commit any sin, there is nothing to protect you. There is nothing wrong with religions but they have been diverted into money orientation and power orientation.

They should have been spirit oriented but they are not. Moreover as a result of Self Realization you know the absolute truth that is everybody knows the same thing. I am sitting before you, you all can see, I am sitting before you there is no quarrel about it but unless and until you are Spirit you have different ideas of your own. They are not absolute ideas, there are that’s why so many complications.

So many discussions, arguments and wars but if you know the absolute truth then there is no difference of opinion. Say if you have ten children and close their eyes and ask them what’s wrong with this gentleman. They will always one finger say this one and if you ask the gentlemen have you got a heart trouble he will say how do you know? (he will say how do you know) you tell that this children told us. So, on your fingertips you know the absolute truth. About everyone also you know on your fingertips. So you have a new dimension to your personality which we call as collective consciousness so you have self knowledge and you have the knowledge about everybody else. Another thing is that your attention becomes absolutely pure. There is no lust and greed in your eyes. Christ has said thou shall not have adulterous eyes (Christ has said thou shall not have adulterous eyes. Christ, Jesus Christ has said that thou shall not have adulterous eyes, with the lust and greed in your eyes. Christ has said that thou shall not have adulterous eyes, adulterous means full of greed and lust) and you become like that (you become like that). It is the becoming which is important. Not just talking about it. With this attention you become extremely powerful, very dynamic. At the same time you are extremely compassionate. This happens because you have all these powers within yourself. Also other potential powers that are within you of creativity also start manifesting. There are many artists today who are world famous are Sahaja yogis. And you become absolutely righteous and moral. You automatically give up all destructive habits (You automatically give up all destructive habits). I know many of drug addicts who have become perfectly alright, overnight. By saying this don’t do these people don’t like it. But you become really a righteous person. It happens like this that if you have a snake in your hand and there is darkness and you tell the gentlemen that you got a snake in your hand and he is adamant (adamant and he is oxalate) He will not give up the snake (he will not give up the snake) till the snake bites him but if there is little light it will throw away, he will throw away. In the same way when you are enlightened you will just throw away everything that is destructive for you. In this small lecture I cannot tell you everything about it but to happen your self-realization you don’t need have any lecture about it. It is a living process and you can’t pay for it. There is no obligation like this Mother Earth how much do we pay her for these flowers. She does not understand money also the divine power does not understand money.

You have seed and the divine power as the germinating power (you have the seed) so you can’t pay for it . There are many false people who are talking big and taking money from you. You can’t pay for self-realization also for divine knowledge you can pay for the hall alright. Thus you will realize that it is your birthright to have your self-realization. Specially these modern times are marked for a-mass realization. I call them as blossom time all kinds of turmoil all kinds of problems so human beings start seeking the truth and seeking the peace is described even in Koran as kiyama (described in Koran as kiyama) and clearly said that your hands will speak and will give witness against you. Some call it as a resurrection time, in the Buddhism they describe it as a matrayas advent, in the bible it is described as the last judgement. So you are special people born in those days to get your self-realization and then you will realize that all religions were born on the same tree of spirituality. All the incarnations and all the prophets and all the realized souls said the same thing. Of course it changed with the times little bit. Thus we will be absolutely united like microcosm becomes the macrocosm (microcosm) or you can say like a drop becomes the ocean we all become one in united in one body of the divine. Sahaja yoga is working in 60 nations and I haven’t seen anybody fighting, quarrelling or doing any violence to each other because you all jump in the ocean of joy. Joy is not like happiness and unhappiness. When your ego is pampered you feel happiness but when your ego is punctured you feel unhappiness. One minute you are laughing and other minute you are crying. But joy is singular (joy is singular) and that is to be experienced. I have to just say that those who want to have self-realization can only have it, you cannot force it on anyone. It has to work spontaneously so if you are wanting with pure desire to have your self-realization it will work out. All other desires are impure because you never feel satisfied with them. The economic law is that in general wants are not satiable (economic law is that in general, wants are not satiable). You want to have today, a house then a car then a furniture goes on like that. Whether you are aware or not aware the pure desire to become one with this divine power and it has to manifest otherwise you will not have satisfaction. So many things can be said about self-realization but is not meant for frivolous people (for frivolous people) or idiots you can say or stupid people, is meant for people who are seekers of truth and for those who are honest to themselves. I am sure you are having lots of questions in your mind and you can ask me through your letters whatever may be the questions. Now I have been doing this work from last 25 years and (I have) I know answers to all questions. I can answer all your questions but it’s still a mental acrobat (still a mental acrobat, mental exercise). You have to go beyond the mind. So again I would say those who do not want to have self-realization should leave the hall. It will hardly take ten minutes. You don’t have to pay for it now or never. All the knowledge of inner being you will have without paying anything but you have to give sometime to it and come to the collective because it is a collective happening. Supposing one nail is cut it doesn’t grow so you have to be (connection) in connection with the living organism (of the living organism) so that you can grow in spirituality.

So the first thing is thoughtless awareness. The Second is doubtless awareness. With that you can give realizations to others. You can cure others and you never get into tensions. There are so many blessings in Sahaja yoga that it is impossible to describe in this short lecture. The gentlemen who was playing harmonium here feel what I asked him to record these blessings because they were writing to me every day. He is a computer expert and he told me within one-months’ time all the blessings later have come to this much. So please tell me which one to record I said I have no time. So we gave up the prospects (we gave up). When I came here they told me there is an old man who got paralysis and he could only move one finger like that and he was not a Sahaja yogi. Still out of compassion the Sahaj yogis treated him and I was amazed to see him at the airport he was walking down.

There are three conditions which I will tell you before we start the process of self-realization. The first one is that you should not feel guilty for anything now at this moment. Whatever mistakes you have committed you should face them at that moment and you should not torture yourself. And so please don’t feel guilty. After all you are human beings, you are not Gods so if you have done mistakes it’s all right. So it is important to forgive yourself completely. Because this all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness. The second thing is that you should forgive everyone yourself. Some people say it is difficult to forget but logically whether you forgive or don’t forgive what do you do? You don’t do anything. On the contrary when you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. If you feel guilty then you catch on the center on the left-hand side here. Physically you suffer (physically you suffer) you get a disease called angina, spondylitis (spondylitis is the bone which moves like this, spondylitis). You follow spondylitis, all of you? and also lethargic organs, (lethargic organs, lazy organs. Can you say that) lethargic organs and cervical cancer (cervical cancer, you read in English). And at this moment if you feel guilty the Kundalini won’t rise. And you will miss such a great opportunity to be self-realized. And if you don’t forgive then the center in the optic chiasma is like this absolutely constricted. And it won’t open and the kundalini cannot go through it. So please forgive, forgive everyone in general. Don’t even think about them because it’s a headache. So the third condition is that you have to be absolutely fully confident that you will get your self-realization tonight. You should have faith in yourself. Absolutely because you are a seekers of truth. These are the only three conditions. And maybe request you if you don’t mind that you have to take out your shoes. It helps a lot. One, left one is for your desire. And the right one is for your action. So now we show you how you will be nourishing your own centers. First of all please put your both feet away from each other because these are two powers. You all should be seated. You can come here front if you want to come in the front, there is space here sit down. Those who are sitting on the ground are all right. Alright. Everybody will get it whether you are far or close. Now we have to put the left hand on your lap, on your lap, very comfortable please be seated, comfortably straight. Now please put the left hand on your left lap, comfortably. This is suggestive symbolically that you want to have your self-realization. Please don’t take photographs during meditation, alright, thank you. Use now your right hand for nourishing your centers on the left-hand side. So now please put your right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the spirit. (Loudly, in the heart resides the spirit. Say it loudly). Now if you are the spirit in the light of the spirit, you become your own guide, your own master. So take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the center for your mastery which is built by great prophets and great masters. (Great prophets and great masters) Now take down your hand in the low portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the center surprisingly is for the pure divine knowledge. Now raise your right hand again in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left side. Now on your heart. Now in the corner of your neck and shoulder and please turn your head to your right, to your right, turn it to your right. This is the center I have told you when you feel guilty goes into trouble. Alright. Now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across, this is the center where you have to forgive. Everyone in general. Now please put down your head as far as possible. Now please take your right hand on the backside of your head. And push back your head as far as possible. This is the center where without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes. Just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power. Now the last center stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on the top of the fontanel bone area  (alright go ahead) which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now bend your head as far as possible now important is to push back your fingers as far as possible so that there is a good pressure on your scalp. Now please move your scalp seven times clockwise slowly. Please bend your head. That’s all we have to do. (In Hindi: Sardarji aap logo ko kuch karne ki zaroorat nahi hai..aise hi aap log paar ho jayenge Aap pe Ashirwad hai aur Hindustaniyo par bhi vishesh kar ke..in logo par bhi hai..par pardes mein pareshani hoti hai ...  Sardarji, you people don’t have to do anything. Like that you people will get your self-realization. You have the blessings and with India specially. These people also have but in foreign it is difficult

Now please put both your feet apart from each other and left hand towards me. Please take down your spectacles, glasses (take down the glasses). Now you have to close your eyes, till I tell you please don’t open your eyes. Please put right hand on the heart and close your eyes, here you have to ask me a very fundamental question about yourself. You can call me Mother or Shree Mataji. You can ask a question three times in your heart. Please ask Mother, Am I the spirit. Ask this question 3 times. I have told you that if you become the spirit, you become your own master. Now take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and now here you ask another fundamental question about yourself. Mother, Am I my own master. Ask this question three times. I have already told you that I respect your freedom. And I cannot force the pure divine knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now please take your right hand in the low portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here you ask six times because this center has got 6 petals. Mother, please give me pure divine knowledge. As soon as you ask for pure divine knowledge, the kundalini starts rising. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to say 10 times with full self-confidence. Mother, I am my own master. I have already told you at the very outset that you are not this body, this mind. You are not these emotions and intellect, ego and conditionings but you are the pure spirit. So raise your right hand on top of your heart and with full confidence please say 12 times Mother, I am the pure spirit. All pervading power of love divine love is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and love. Above all it is the ocean of forgiveness so whatever mistakes you have committed will be easily dissolved by this great power of forgiveness. Say 16 times with full confidence in yourself. Please say Mother, I am not guilty at all, 16 times. I have already told you whether you forgive you don’t forgive you don’t do anything but if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands and at this moment specially please forgive so that this center opens for the kundalini to pass.

Otherwise you have tortured yourself all your life and now you are going to miss the great opportunity of self-realization. So now raise your right hand on the top of your forehead and put down your head properly. Here you have to say again with full confidence, not how many times, but from your heart. Mother, I forgive everyone in general. Don’t think about them. Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power. So please take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head. Here you have to say again from your heart, not how many times. Oh divine power, please forgive me if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly. Now the last sentence which is very important. Please put, press your, I should say stretch your palm, please stretch your palm. And put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Please stretch back your fingers and put down your head. Here again I cannot force self-realization on you, you have to ask for it. So please push back your fingers nicely and have a good pressure on your scalp. Now move your scalp with the pressure seven times slowly, clockwise. Saying seven times, Mother please give me my self-realization. Now please take down your hands. Put both the hands towards me, like this. Please open your eyes. Now put the right hand towards me like this and bend your head and see with the left hand, if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Don’t put your hand on top of your head, away from it. Some people get it close and some further on. Now please put the left hand towards me and with the right hand please bend your head, bend your head. If there is a cool or a hot breeze like sensation coming out of your fontanel bone area. Lastly now the right hand and put down your head and see for yourself again properly. Alright. Don’t doubt. Alright. Now please put both your hands towards the sky, push back your head and ask any one of these three questions. You can ask Mother, Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. 3 times or Mother, Is this the all-pervading power of the divine love or is it the Rooh, Paramchaitanya. Ask three times. Now please bring down your hands. Now see for yourself. Watch me without thinking. Watch me without thinking. Put your hands like this. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze like sensation on the fingertips or in the palm or out of the fontanel bone area. Please raise both your hands. Those who have felt it good. The whole of Bangkok has got realization, I think. May God bless you. You all have now become saints. I bow to you. Please look after your self-realization (please look after your self-realization). You have to give little time. Please come to the collective. And I am sure you can all grow very fast in spirituality. There you learn how to be in meditation. You cannot do meditation you have to be in the meditation, where you are thoughtlessly aware. You are thoughtless but aware. That is in the present, you are in present which is the reality, so you grow in reality. Maximum in one month’s time you will become masters.

Thank you very much. May God bless you all.
