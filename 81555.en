Linda mentioned that there needed to be someone to go with Shri Mataji, and I agreed to go. It was quite chaotic in Chelsham Road, and to cut a long story short, I was running late. Shri Mataji was there with Pamela at the station, and I ran into the station, bought the ticket, and then ran to the train. I could see Pamela and Shri Mataji in first class. I thought, "God, I should have gotten a first-class ticket."

So I went in and said, "I'm just going to go and change my ticket, Shri Mataji."

She said, "Why?"

I said, "Well, I just didn't think, Shri Mataji. I bought a second-class ticket."

She said, "Pamela, go and change our tickets."

I said, "No, no, it's okay," and pleaded with Shri Mataji, but she wouldn't have it. She made Pamela go and change their tickets to second class. Pamela arrived back, and I thought, "Oh my God, not only am I late, but Shri Mataji is changing her tickets to second class."

Shri Mataji was in the lead, and the three of us walked from carriage to carriage. She went into the first second-class carriage, and it was completely packed. I thought, "Oh no," and started feeling really guilty, a catch on my heart and everything. We went into the next carriage, and again, it was completely packed. I think it wasn't until the fourth carriage that we found one that was completely empty. Pamela sat down with Shri Mataji's luggage, and Shri Mataji sat there. I gingerly sat opposite her, still feeling quite bad about it all.

But then the train pulled away, and I felt something in my lap. It was Shri Mataji's foot. She said, "Rub my feet." I thought, "Wow." So I started to rub her feet. It was always different when you rubbed Shri Mataji's feet. Sometimes you felt quite hot or uncomfortable. Other times you'd go into complete joy and bliss, and that was one of those times. I just went into this complete joy. The vibrations would go right into your center heart, you'd have a big whoosh of energy, and you'd just feel lots of love. The only way I can explain it is that I just wanted to go into her feet. In those moments, I just wanted to hug her and kiss her, and it was uncontrollable ecstasy, bliss, and joy.

That went on for three hours. All that guilt just completely disappeared. That particular weekend in Sheffield, Shri Mataji just completely spoiled me, always giving me her food. That was one of the occasions when I called her "Mum" by mistake many times. So it went from feeling guilty and insecure to feeling complete joy and bliss. We were incredibly lucky to have that opportunity to touch her feet and put our head on her feet, to have that care.

Best second-class ticket you've ever had?

Yes!

Did she have a sense of humor, making you laugh?

Yes, I've got another one of those. She had very fast, quick humor. Myself and Fergie were there, with many people working. There's an area of the house that was an outside space, not actually a courtyard but similar and much smaller. It was the well. Shri Mataji was coming downstairs, and she said to me, "Where's Fergie?"

I said, "I think he's in the well."

And she said, "Who put him in?"

I said, "Punk."

And she said, "Little Tommy Finn."

She was so fast that it took a little while to get the joke.

So, ladies, give me some experience.
