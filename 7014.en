English Transcript

So now welcome to you all for this Puna place. In the Shastras is described as Punya Patana, meaning the city of Punyas. That's the reason I wanted to stay in Puna, thinking that people are very auspicious and full of punyas, and I am sure I'll find them very soon, all those who have come to this place will be there available for Sahaja Yoga.

Yesterday you must have seen there were so many people who had come for Sahaja Yoga and were very much impressed by your beautiful music, and the rendering in Marathi language and what we call is they felt the kautuk. Kautuk is the, there's no word in English, but what a father or a mother when she sees the talents of her children feels, you see, that feeling is a kautuka, and that's what they were all feeling very much enamored that how these people have taken to Marathi language, and they were very happy about it. I could see on their faces writ large their joy and a kind of a fondness for it, such an endearing thing for them. First of all is the language, another is the music because, you know Maharastrans are very fond of Indian music so they were very much surprised how you could sing in such a beautiful way the tunes and the different talas that you use. They were very much surprised and very much enamored.

Now for Puna puja, there's nothing special as such but except we are doing here the puja for our punyas, is to ask for punyas. Now what are the punyas? How do you get punyas? We have to know about it. We have certain dharmas within us, and these dharmas are to be observed to get punyas. For a Sahaja Yogi, the first dharma is to be innocent and to be a holy person. He should not have his attention on wrong things; he should not be distracted by wrong things; he should not try to justify anything that is inauspicious. And he should feel the vibrations of another person, and should feel relationship with the Sahaja Yogis and not with non-Sahaja Yogis. Between the non-Sahaja Yogis and the Sahaja Yogis, a Sahaja Yogi must always stand by a Sahaja Yogi and never by a non-Sahaja Yogi, even if he is right. Even if another person is right, you should not, in confrontation with a non-Sahaja Yogi, stand by him.

The second dharma is to appreciate and understand the beauty of nature, to live with nature. I am very happy that you love to live with the nature, and you don't want artificial things; that you understand the creativity of human beings and you try to create more beautiful things with them. For that you need not spend too much money. It should not be bought just for resale or something like that, but it should be bought for your own enjoyment and must be kept as a piece of art with yourself. But all that must be auspicious, has to be holy.

Anything unholy is not an art. It is ... I always feel, that if there was art they would not take recourse to these nonsensical things. When they try to express something in a, this kind of a obnoxious expression, then be sure it is no art. Otherwise why do they take help from these obnoxious things? So one has to understand that if you have to appreciate an art and all that, just shun all that is unholy, shun all that is ugly, anything that suggests some sort an obscenity cannot be art, because they have to take help from obscenity to make it more interesting for people who have weaknesses for obscenity.

There was gentleman whom I knew and were gone to an exhibition to see things. There were lots of paintings people were selling. This fellow was a known drunkard and his wife was a known drunkard, both of them. I mean, people used to say that whenever they are there they will never leave the party till everybody's finished, then they will go. And I was so surprised that they wanted to buy some painting, and they bought the paintings of all the drunkards, you see. So is very surprising that fraternity of drunkards was so much I just couldn't understand, how did they take to drunkards, you see. And all the photographs, how they are sitting in a pub or in the house they are drinking and all such stupid type of things they bought.

And we both started looking at each other that "these drunkards look so horrid, all their wrinkles you can count one by one, and the falling on the road and the streets and all kinds of faces."

They had no way they were beautiful - none of them, neither the women nor the men. They looked something out of this world, and they were all were appreciating it so much, you see, everything they were appreciating. So we thought even when they were not drunk, you see, there was some sort of a drunkenness in them. Otherwise how could they like such a nonsensical thing?

So the fraternity of obnoxious things and fraternity of ugliness works with ugly people. Ugly people always like ugliness, and those who are violent within will say that "We want to look violent and we want to look like wild people, we want to look like people who are aggressive, we must have a ..."

In India nowadays they are advertising that if you wear this kind of a dress, your ego will express itself. At least in the West people are ashamed of their ego, but in India they say if you smoke, then the ego shows better. We are following your footsteps till we fall into the same ditch, blindly.

Now regarding the dharma of Nabhi is very important. The dharma of Nabhi to begin with is, as you know, that you have to be a good householder. You have to be a
gentleman in the sense you should be a gentle personality, should treat your family, your children, with gentleness. If the men become gentle, that doesn't mean you become henpecked, just become a sort of a tail of your wife, as they say. We have had very bad time with such men who really listen to their wives. To them Sahaja Yogi is nothing, their family is everything, their wives are everything. That's going too far.

So one thing about dharma is that it has its own limitations. and its own grace, and its own style. For example a man should behave like a man; not like a devil, of course, but also not like a henpecked husband. So there's some maryadas to all the dharmas and out of that this is a very important dharma one has to follow. I know some people who get married just get lost. Where are they? One year you
never see them.

"Mother, they are still with their honeymoon."

That's not a sign of a yogi; that's not the sign of person who has achieved that enlightenment. On the contrary, in India the other way round. As soon as the wife comes they think, "Now we've got some sort of a person who can be the target." Husbands won't talk to wives, won't have anything to do with them. They'll just run away, or even if they have to talk or do anything, you see, they'll say something very harsh - or the mother-in-law will make up, or the father-in-law, if not all others.

The wives then become very cunning and they try to play around and play games with their husbands. The whole thing is nonsensical; it has nothing to do with the grahasta's dharma, means the householder's dharma. We have to respect each other, you have to respect your children, you have to respect your household, you have to respect your family. Respect is the way you can follow that dharma very well.

Now the another dharma is the Raja dharma where you should not behave in an illegal manner, you should not break laws. There's no need. For the heck of it people do it, just for the heck of it. There's no need to break laws. For Sahaja Yogis as you know customs never bother you, toll people never bother you. You don't have to bother much about anything, but don't try to make problems for Sahaja Yoga. There are many people who break laws and create problems for us. So you have to be law abiding people, pay your income tax, pay your things properly and don't put us into trouble, because people will say tomorrow that "These cheats are Sahaja Yogis."

Money ways you must know that all this money belongs to your Mother, though She may not need it and She may not have it, and should be kept for the use of Sahaja Yoga whenever it is possible, and not for other indulgences into which we get. Because whatever money you give to Sahaja Yoga is going to help others to develop themselves into Sahaja Yog; and too, in many ways, is a very punya-giving thing is to donate or to be generous.

Actually I enjoy My generosity more than anything else, and this generosity must be enjoyed thoroughly, otherwise we are not doing the dharma of our Lakshmi Tattwa. So to be generous, to be friendly, to use matter to give to others, is such a beautiful thing; and that gives such a beautiful personality to you - so much love, little little things you know sometimes.

Once a lady had come to see Me. She married, she was an English lady married to and Indian boy; and she felt very unhappy in her family because they would not accept her. So she came down to see Me to Bombay and I gave her a - I mean it's nothing much - a necklace, of pearl necklace. And for many years I never met her. Then in one party she came to know that I was coming, so she wore that necklace. I had forgotten all about it, everything.

She came, "Do you recognize this necklace?"

I said, "No. What is it about?" I couldn't understand much.

She said, "Do you know when I came first to Your house, You are the One Who gave me love and You gave me this necklace. I always carry it with me, and when I heard that You are coming, then I wore it. Otherwise I never wear it."

It touched My heart so much. Just see a small thing I did for her. The generosity of every kind is very helpful, it's very energy giving.

Once I was sitting outside and knitting some sweaters for My children when a lady came from Pakistan - the children were not born, but I was just knitting.

So they said, "Mother will you give us a ..." They didn't know that I was Mataji and then they said, "Will You give us some place in Your house?"

My father had a big house in Delhi and it had one room outside.

I said, "All right, you can come and stay." Immediately I said.

They said, "We are refugees from Pakistan."

And My brother came in. He said, "What do You mean? Do you know these people? They could be thieves, they'll do ..."

But I said, "But what are they going to steal from you? The room is completely outside, they have nothing to do with us. What is there? Poor things are in need, tomorrow supposing we become refugees."

He wouldn't agree, was shouting at Me. Then he asked My husband to come, and he also told him and brainwashed him, and the both were after My life.

I said, "Nothing doing they are going to stay here and this is My father's house and I'm going to put down My foot there."

And they didn't know what to do, and they wrote to My father. And My father said, "Whatever She says is all right, you don't bother Her."

So then they stayed, these three persons stayed in My house. One of them was a Muslim, and there was a big reaction to the way it had happened in Pakistan, people started killing all the Muslims. And they came to My doorstep and said, "There's a Muslim staying with You and we want to see him."

I said, "There's no Muslim." I told him a lie.

He said, "How is it?"

I said, "You see My this thing? Why will I tell you a lie? After all if there's a Muslim, I would not keep Muslim in My house." And somehow or other with My cunning I convinced them, and they went away and the fellow has saved.

Later on long time back I heard that the lady who was there has become a very well known actress and the gentleman whom I saved had become a very great poet. And they wanted to see Me and meet Me; but I was frightened that, you see, it's bit too much. They might think, I mean it's rather embarrassing for Me.

One day suddenly they had started a film institute and they asked Me that, "Please come for that because we want You to be the Vice President and all that." And they said that, "If you can ask these two persons, they will help us."

I said, "Never tell them that this is our work, otherwise I'll be very embarrassed and they'll be forced to do it, there will be no freedom. So then they suddenly, you see, these people came and the shooting started. And she's looking at Me and she just looked at Me, she couldn't believe I was there. She just came and hugged Me and started crying.

She said, "How are You here?"

They said, "Do you know her?"

She said, "Of course, I know Her very well."

They said, "This is Her work."

"Why didn't you tell me? I don't want anything. I'll do anything for Her." And the whole thing came back, you know. I also had tears in My eyes.

So generosity always helps you. So this is the dharma one has to do for getting
the punya. Another is you must have a very kind and sensitive heart, is very important. That is the way the dharma of the manna works out. Very kind, never to be harsh, never to be punishing, never to be judging others; but you have to be very
kind and gentle with others. Unless and until it is very necessary to tell them sometimes, you should do it. Otherwise, normally you should be extremely kind to people.

Then comes the dharma of collectivity. In collectivity you should understand how to behave. You must understand how to carry on with the collectivity. Also you must understand how to make everybody happy. Never talk ill of others; never come and tell Me ill of others. I know everyone very well; but if you tell Me, immediately I will know you better. I don't like people telling Me against anyone; I like the person who always says good things about others. So if you try any such tricks with Me, immediately I will know what's wrong with that person, but may be some people think that "Somebody has told Mother something against me, that's why this has happened." Nobody can befool Me on that point.

So you have to be careful as to how you deal with other people. If you are harsh or if you are intriguing or if you are sly, if you are mean, if you are playing tricks and all that - that's the worst thing that can happen is that you will have no love from anyone. Nobody is going to trust you. Some people have a habit I have seen that, that if they find somebody who is available or is willing to do some work for them then they make a slave out of that person. I've known this happening. Some girls have done that to another girl that "You just become a slave, you do this for my sons, you do this for my child, you do this for ..." - like that. If the girl has no children then she'll have it.

This kind of thing is absolutely against Sahaj. You should do all your own work, and whatever is possible you should do for others instead of telling people, "Do this and do that," make them slaves. This is one of the dharmas of the manna, which one should understand is to be done properly, and then in the collectivity also if you use the same understanding of love and the maryadas of love, you can do a lot of things good to others and to yourself. It's very joy giving, very joy giving. To love others itself is very joy giving, and to know that you love others is even more. And even when they are harsh to you and troublesome to you, still you love them, then it is even better. It's much better to forgive others, and this forgiveness should come to us so spontaneously, because it is just you forget it, just forget.

Sometimes people say things to Me and then next day they say, "Mother, please forgive us, we said such and such thing."

I said, "I've forgotten. When was that?"

"Yesterday."

"Yesterday? It's lost now, yesterday is lost from My memory. I don't remember all that."

So I just forget it, and that's how you can feel happy. If you go on remembering and thinking about it, "Oh he has said it like this, now I am going to bite him," then you are a snake. So best is to forget and forgive, just forgive. Forgiveness is the best way you can punish others and can put them right, because they will get corrected by that. You must learn to forgive. Their correction is the greatest punishment and is the greatest benevolence for them.

So now you come to the Sahasrara. In the Sahasrara you know that you have to surrender your ego and your super ego in Sahaja Yoga. If this surrendering is done without thinking, automatically then you are all right. It should be done automatically, spontaneously. In the beginning you'll have to make efforts. You have to see yourself in the mirror, you have to see why you think no end of yourself, what is so great about yourself. Put somebody great in front and say that "Am I greater than this person? What is that I think I'm so great? And the second point is the conditionings that I have." Just count them. "What do I do morning till evening, what kind of conditioning I have got?"

And some people have very queer, funny conditionings. See like if they give their little bit of cream to use, they'll take it back home. Or if they bring a little ... say a spoon or something, and they'll say, "Where is my spoon? I must get my spoon back" or some sort of a box or a bag even. "Last time when you came we had given you a bag or a box, that's lying in the junk thing - you know, somewhere - so you must find out that."

This kind of a nonsense is there, and I remember one case in Delhi where two ladies had brought some ghee in a Dalda tin - you see, when you see the ridiculousness, then you will understand how stupid it is - and they came to ask for that Dalda tin. And I saw Mr. Pai running from the backside and I was angry with him.

I said, "Why did you come this side?"

He said, "Mother, You see these two ladies they have come for their Dalda tin."

So I said, "Well you tell them, 'we will give you a full Dalda tin.'"

"No, they want the same, same Dalda tin."

I said, "Give them any one, how will they recognize?"

"No, they have marked it."

(Ann, Dalda is a brand name. It's like what you have Mazola here. So, Dalda is the brand name for ghee that is made by one of the companies in India.)

You see, how stupid people are, shows their nature of smallness, of their very, very low level of breeding. I mean, just imagine, like worms they are, the way they get after Dalda tins, it's ... just think of it! And they justify it.

"Yes, yes we brought it, but you see we needed it."

So this is the another extreme I'm saying. Another extreme is that you give away everything that you have. Supposing in My head it comes, "I have to give away this." I immediately do it, because if I don't give it will go on troubling Me, "Why didn't I give? I should have given away."

So you see the mind is that way, "What will give Me happiness is I have given away, thank God got rid of it," because that feeling that "I have to give away" itself is joy giving. And once I've given away, the joy starts bubbling out. So like a load which is on My head just goes out, but not that the thing is a load, but that the feeling that "I have to do this; I have to give this." If somebody I cannot give then I go on remembering "I have not given this to this person, I've given to everybody, but why should I not give it to everyone?" And it's very joy giving; it's very nice and because of this I get right things at the right time and very cheap, because it's for giving.

So it comes from one side and I give. From another side it comes, I give; and people say, "Mother you get such nice things. How did you get it?"

I say, "I don't know, it was just there and I have collected it and just close." I don't have to worry, at the right time I get right things of the right value just like that. Sometimes it's in My house, I find it's there. "From where do You get it?" God alone knows.

So this comes from your generosity for others, feelings for others. And do it in a graceful way. Not that once you give something to someone, "Oh, I gave you this, you know, ten years back, and this is I have given it to you ten years back." Even a cup of tea they'll remember. It's horrible sometimes the way people talk about things. After all, you see if you have given somebody - actually, sometimes I give very nice things I should say.

Then I say, "What a nice thing you are wearing!"

"Mother You have given me."

Then I feel so embarrassed that (laughter). So now I don't say even that. It's quite frightened of Myself because if I say something is nice, somehow it turns out to be one I have given them. I feel very bad, then I think it's very embarrassing to say such a thing.

So a kind of a shy, bashful understanding should be there about oneself. This bashfulness is a beauty of human beings. Those who do not have this bashfulness, who are just ... even the animals are bashful. Any animal you take is bashful, even the lion is a bashful animal. If you don't have that bashfulness in you, then I don't know what you look like. There's nothing to compare in this world. I can't think of anything which is without bashfulness. So there should be certain amount of bashfulness which gives you a beautiful continence and a beautiful temperament.

So at Sahasrara it's just the surrendering, which we call "Islam", means surrender. Surrender what? Surrender your ego and surrender your bad conditioning is the point which one has to reach, and once it happens you are off loaded. Off loaded, you are free and the ascent starts, the ascent is very much faster then. You give up "My sister, my brother, my son, my this, my that" - the whole thing goes off, and you become absolutely free and you start understanding.

So this is how we have to look after our dharmas and we have to achieve the punyas and these are the punyas. There's a very nice story of ... I think Namadeva only, I don't know ... Eknath. He went down, there's a custom that you have to take one pitcher like this - water, and they had to take it to Dwarika. So he went there, carried it all the way; and on the way when they reached the temple, at the foothill of the temple, he saw a one donkey, which was very thirsty and was dying out of thirst. So he took his taavar, he took his pitcher to him and made him drink all the water.

So everybody said, "All the way you brought this, and what are you doing here at the foothill when you have to go to the temple and do the Abhisheka? You finished it here?"

He said, "You don't know, God himself has come down and is thirsty. I better give Him."

This understanding of doing things for Sahaja Yoga, of doing things for others and enjoying that is the greatest punya.

May God bless you.

[Marathi to English translation]

As so many people have come from abroad, I will speak in English later.  But it should be noted that these people came from so far away , from 30 countries, and how many people are in Pune? How many Sahaj Yogis have come from Pune? So Sahaja Yoga doesn't seem to have grown in Pune. Also, one can see rivalry here. Every person is trying to prove himself or herself right. So that's why today I want to say a few words about it. I saw that another centre has been set up and in that centre it is said that spirituality does not require money, then why collect contributions? Well yes, spirituality does not need money, but installing this tent does need money. Money is required for various other things also. Until today I have spent my own money in foreign and have been visiting India and continuing to do so. Apart from that my Maharashtra tour has just started along with the money from the trust. You will be surprised to know that the trust money has also come from outside India. No one has given a single paisa. People have gotten used to free rides to the extent that they will also eat food without paying money. And looks like people particularly from here are most miser in nature. They will come to Puja and bring their own lunch boxes and not eat there. They don't understand that it is prasad ,they can't even do that. Sahaja Yoga is not for such beggars. I cannot digest affluence and I cannot digest poverty. People who have such a beggar's attitude should leave Sahaja Yoga and oblige us, this is a request. So that other good people can come into Sahaja Yoga. Because those who come here, they also behave in a beggarly manner, I have heard. Everything needs money today, only the soul does not. I accept that one does not need effort for the soul, but for everything else money is required. This rivalry has to be curtailed and stopped.

So there are more people at Ganapatipule from Delhi.  This is so shameful. One has to pay attention to this. If one is not generous, then he or she is not a Sahaja Yogi. It's important to remember that Sahaja Yoga is our responsibility. We have to incur this expense. How long will Mataji bear the expense? For everything Mataji provides, so does that mean you take free rides?

Once Akbar asked Birbal a question: who is the vilest of the vile in the world? Birbal answered saying no one can be more vile than those who beg at the Almighty's door. So I have seen this specifically in Pune, no other place has troubled me. Racking your brains and coming up with such questions.So I very well know the money contribution required and how much gets accumulated. All the money of the trust is poured by us and donated by these people [foreigners]. Poured the money and bought places/properties for you all.

We don't have anyone doing dishonesty, no one embezzles money, no one does wrongdoing. So to say that they collect contributions means as if people embezzle money or what? People who are working in this way should close their centres altogether.And they can't be called Sahaja Yogis. And for this I am not responsible. We are not responsible if people going to those centres face problems. So this is about the centre and about Pune.

Now we have seen for two days how crowded the centre was- that is for our program. So many people had come. This means, there's no doubt that people in Pune want to know God and are seekers. But for that we don't even want to experience a bit of inconvenience. And if God himself comes and falls at our feet then nothing is better than that. With such a tendency, it remains to be seen how many of these people will easily embrace and grow in Sahaja Yoga and progress in it. And again the third type of people I've seen are people who use Sahaja Yoga for their business or something to make money, these are the vilest of the vile people. What is easily possible that should be done [what is possible in Sahaja] -  this attitude of Pune people surprises me as Pune is PunyaPattanna [ historical or cultural reference of Pune meaning holy city].

So yesterday and the day before, I spoke about Sahaja Yoga in a very clear way, one could say in a very straightforward manner yet in a light-hearted way. So yesterday, as I spoke for one and a half hours, people sat absolutely silent and thoughtlessness got established within them.And they might come into this [Sahaja Yoga], but they will hesitate after seeing you people. Because you do not listen to your leaders, nor do you respect them. You do not present yourselves as if you are worthy. You are always after saving money everywhere.How to make money, money money money money. This possession must be let go.If you do not show generosity then God will not bless you.

Only when one door opens wind will come in from the other door.But if you keep one door closed and open the other, wind will not come. The first thing is that a miserly person has no place in Sahaja Yoga. Those who want to be stingy should not stay in Sahaja Yoga. Such people will get nothing and will not progress. A miserly person has no worth at all in Sahaja Yoga. It is better that such a person should continue their miserly behavior and stay at home.Talking about money troubles me deeply because you know that I do not care about money.But this must be learned if we are to awaken the principle of Lakshmi [Lakshmi tattva ]within us. Therefore a person must have at least a little bit of a generous heart.

To add to that, no one understands that Sahaja Yoga is our responsibility. This is our responsibility. We have

found Sahaja Yoga.If you give a flame to a lamp, it immediately starts giving light. In the same way, you are made to give light. Neither just for showing off or taking advantage of this nor for roaming around the world saying we are Sahaja Yogis or that later Mataji keeps giving us anyway.When are you going to give to Sahaja Yoga? Your effort is needed. I don’t want what is called body ,mind, wealth.Even though I don’t want it, Sahaja Yoga needs it. It is not taken up as responsibility and just two or four people end up doing all the work.Then they are told that you think too highly of yourself, you are too arrogant. But only these two or four people are actually working.

Remember that such people will drop out of Sahaja Yoga.

So if you want to make your own progress, then first know that this is your responsibility. It must be understood that Sahaja Yoga is a very big responsibility of ours and must be acted upon according to that responsibility. Those who cannot handle this responsibility and those who think they have come into Sahaja Yoga just to bathe in joy, they should remember that they will not be able to last long in Sahaja Yoga.This wheel is spinning very fast and people are very quickly thrown out of that wheel. Many who kept saying “me, me” have been thrown out. I am not responsible for that. You are responsible for that. Because we have to run this wheel. Coming to meet me a little or bowing to Mataji or taking darshan and consider that Sahaja Yoga is practiced.Then when you get a heart attack, you come and say, Mataji, how did I get a heart attack? Even though I read your mahatmya [greatness] every day. As long as you do not come into collectivity. Though a center has been kept right in your town for you. A center  on Sunday has been arranged properly. Still if you do not make progress through that, then you must understand that you yourself will be responsible for that.

These people come here from far away taking leaves with so much effort. They give money to your entire trust. Your entire expense is being managed today because of these people. If I stop this travelling from tomorrow and reduce my effort, then I feel we all will end up in the open.There will be no arrangement of money possible.Therefore, please keep this in mind.

Secondly, it is a very joyful thing that many Pune girls’ marriages have happened outside and all their marriages are fixed and I hope that all of them will live with happiness and comfort. We must truly feel auspicious about it, that these girl's weddings are happening so easily without spending anything and so beautifully.

Above all, there’s one more thing. Our girls should go out and show how wise the girls from Maharashtra are. To go there and act arrogant. They are more learned than you. They are more educated than you. They are very clever. But their characteristic is that knowledge is adorned by humility. A person who has acquired knowledge but has no humility. That person is, I feel, an uneducated foolish donkey. It is said “Knowledge is adorned by humility.” So, if you do not have humility and if you don’t know the way to follow the marital customs then you should not get married. And if you do get married, then, at least for me, I feel a lot of distress.That’s why I have something to say even to these girls that they must not act arrogant when they go there. Several, two or four, such incidents have already happened in Pune itself, where the girls were useless, even good for nothing. Their marriages were arranged. So we have a saying in Tamil language, that those who live in mud will find even a bed uncomfortable. Something similar has been done.So today, I am intentionally saying and making it clear that even though I have given consent to all these marriages, it is your very big responsibility to behave properly. You must earn recognition. Sahaja Yoga must be recognized. The culture of this country must gain recognition, and Sahaja Yoga must gain recognition.This is a very big opportunity. At the very least, you can do this much for Sahaja Yoga, if you take its responsibility. But if you keep fighting with your husband, constantly demanding things, behaving foolishly, if you start this kind of behavior, then you too will get no happiness from it. It will not be beneficial for you and it will not be beneficial for Sahaja Yoga either.

You know Ganpati more than these people. It is our heritage. You know a lot. You know every small detail. You also know many useless rituals. But in Sahaja Yoga, we have to take only what is necessary. We should leave what is unnecessary and completely renounce what is foolish. So now you have come into a new religion. Your new religion is Vishwa Nirmal Dharma. And according to that religion, you should do only what is appropriate. In this, we do not believe in caste, you know that. We do not believe in home or foreign land. You should remember this. And if you have caste restrictions or home or foreign land restrictions, then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. I have to tell many fathers that if they are insisting on marrying their daughter to a  man with high family stature then I will create some obstacles in it and give trouble. I will deliberately do that. I have already decided. If it happens that the marriage takes place within our own caste on its own accord, then there is no issue. But if you try to forcefully marry the girl against her wish, then knowingly I will create obstacles in it. So that you will come to your senses that you are a Sahaja Yogi. We have started such a big revolution and if in such a big revolution you cannot help us even this little, then why do you come into Sahaja Yoga at all? This caste system has driven our country mad and has caused so much trouble. You know that the caste system is meaningless. If tomorrow someone abandons your daughter, which person from your caste will actually stand by you? Instead, some other girl will come and stand by you. So such a society should be given up completely. Because such a society cannot be seen anywhere. I have never seen this society conduct any religious work, or any social work, or even show its existence anywhere. This society just exists without any certainty. And this imaginary society is the very one that consumes people. So everyone must rise up above this. We are so many people united together. In the past, even a single person has accomplished such work. So now that we are so many and we all have the same one belief, the same one awareness. So you should think, what is the reason to be afraid? And having thought this, you must remember that we are involved in this righteous war, we have a responsibility. And such a thing has not happened for ages and ages. This is a very great thing. We have to climb this final step. Everything must be cleaned there. Everything must be set right there. We must bring the kingdom of love there. We must remove all poverty there.There is so much work. But if these cobwebs [of caste system] of yours have still not gone, how will the next step go well? This obsession with caste must be abandoned. And do not even meet people of the same caste at all. Dnyaneshwar has said, “All are your kin and relatives.” Your ties with other people are cut. All are your kin and relatives. It has been clearly said that all these people only are your kin and relatives and nothing else. And one who does not go to the center should not be called a Sahaja Yogi. One must go to the center. You may be rich in your home, but you must go to the center. I too stay with you in huts, and live in any circumstances. So thinking that the center must be very beautiful and glamorous is very wrong. The center should be very simple where common people can also come. Until today, it has been many days since I could speak clearly with our Sahaja Yogis of Pune. Today, in these pleasant surroundings, I feel that one kind of pleasantness should also arise within us. And for that pleasantness to come, the pointless old-fashioned rituals and the completely wrong ideas regarding religion within us must go and we should come into the pure and clean Ganges only then this work can happen. Along with that, we must also guard against ego.  Ego about anything causes trouble. I am someone special. Some Sahaja Yogis think that we came to Sahaja Yoga first so it is something special. But I see that those who came first are the very ones who are leaving.Most of those who were there right in the beginning are simply cutting off. That means that these imaginations of “we came to Sahaja Yoga first” will be the first thing to turn against you. Therefore, the feeling that we are very old Sahaja Yogis must be removed. It means you have become outdated, now it’s time to go. Every time freshness should be there only then one is a Sahaja Yogi. Because this is a living process it happens within us every day. Every day we get new and new experiences. Every time there should be joyful novelty. And if you keep thinking that I am very senior [male or female reference] then your outdatedness will show. Therefore attention must be paid to what we say about ourselves.

It is best if you speak only about Sahaja Yoga and about me. Only that can make everything alright. So the meaning of surrender is that these old things within us must be left behind. And the ego we have collected must also be destroyed.
