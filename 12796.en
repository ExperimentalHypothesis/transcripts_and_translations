1993-10-11 Shri Mataji, 'Reel Women' Interview, P2, Los Angeles, USA,

Interviewer - Welcome Shri Mataji!

Shri Mataji - Thank You.

Interviewer - What is human evolution? What it is the next step in human evolution?

Shri Mataji - Next Step is to become the spirit which you are. You are the pure spirit, you are not this body, mind, ego, all your conditionings but you are the pure spirit and that’s what you have to become. In evolutionary process, you have become a human being, in human awareness we have not been able to reach the absolute truth. If we had reached the absolute truth there would have been no problems, no quarrelling, no arguments and no wars but because we are all holding something as truth which is not absolute that’s why we are fighting. 

Interviewer - You describe Self-realization as a living process of the kundalini where you can feel on your central nervous system.  Can you explain?

Shri Mataji - Yes. We have evolved so far through a process of evolution which is spontaneous, which is a living process and now once this evolutionary process takes place, when you become the spirit, then you achieve so many of your powers which are not yet known to you.

Interviewer - What is the cool breeze that you experience and what is the reference to the Holy Ghost?         

Shri Mataji - So this done through a power which is called as kundalini in your sacrum bone which is the sacred bone. It’s like any connection you have to put; supposing you have a television and if it is not connected to the mains it looks like just a box in the same way we think we are the boxes but once we are connected then we realise how many things (can) are there, which we have never knew that we owned them, we are the power of that. Actually this is your own power to begin with and the manifestation of this when it is connected to the mains to the all-pervading power of divine love then the first thing you feel is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head. It is the reflection of the Holy Ghost is this kundalini or we call it as  Adishakti. Then this comes out of your head you can clearly feel the cool breeze coming out of your head. Also you can feel them on your fingertips, when you feel them on your fingertips actually it is on your central nervous system you can feel those centres which are actually, are the last points of the sympathetic nervous system. So the right side you can feel the physical and the mental problems of your centres and on the left hand side you can feel the emotional problems of your centres. If this is decode properly, then you can feel your own centres so the first thing you get is self knowledge; knowledge about yourself; now many people who get diseases they don't know they have got disease they have to go through diagnosis, this that, here you don't have to do anything like that you just on fingertips you can feel it. What’s wrong with you physically or mentally, emotionally or what’s wrong with you spiritually because you might have gone to some false person, there must be some spiritual problem in you, everything can be verified on these fingertips. In Koran is described that’s when resurrection time will come your hands will speak and they will give witness against you, its very clearly described.

Interviewer - And we are in this special time?

Shri Mataji - Yes of course, this is the special time of resurrection when you do feel that. Not only that but when this Kundalini rises then all these centres are nourished, integrated and enlightened and you get the well-being of your physical side, mental side, emotional side and spiritual side as a result you become extremely calm, peaceful, healthy. We are all the time thinking about future and past, one thought rises falls another thought rises falls, in between these thoughts there is a little space, we live in the past or the future, the little space is the present. We can't live in the present, when this kundalini rises she  elongates those thoughts and the space in between increases and you become thoughtlessly aware in Sanskrit it is called as 'Nirvichar Samadhi' that your awareness becomes thoughtlessly aware. You see everything, know everything but you are thoughtless so thus your peace is established. If there is no peace within whats use of talking about peace; having conference of peace, organisations of peace, there should be peace within. I have known people you have got peace awards, one of the most hot tempered people so how can they have peace award, I don't know they have got peace award alright so doesn't matter. Now this is what is the first achievement is that you feel thoughtlessly aware, then you can feel on your fingertips also the centres of others that means you are collectively conscious. This is second dimension in your awareness, who is the other you become part and parcel of the whole so you can feel the chakras of another person not only that but sitting down here you can feel anybody’s chakras and if you know how to correct yours, you can correct yours and if you know how to correct others, you can correct that; thus you can correct all the chakras and you can solve the problems. Another thing that happens to you is that you attention becomes very pure, there is no lust and greed in your attention, it becomes innocent, you look at things innocently. In Sahaja yoga now we have so many people but I have never heard of anybody’s wife running away with somebody or nothing, the flirting, all that is finished now. They are just like children, very innocent people like angels. This attention is also active, when you pay attention to (some) somebody, it acts, it works, it heals, it helps, it’s remarkable because the kingdom of God is the most efficient kingdom you could think of and it is work with the all the subtle of all the elements like it has a subtle of the ether, subtle of the earth, all these things are control by this all pervading power and once you are connected with it, you know that whatever you desire, whatever you want happens. A person becomes extremely creative, I have known many artist from India who have become now world famous, have got realisation and became. They were Muslims, Hindus all kinds of people then you transcend all the limitation of this artificial life, transcend the limitation of these outside religions and your inner religion, innate religion starts manifesting by which you really become really become religious. Its not that ,eh, you may be Christian, Hindu, Muslim but you can commit any sin, anybody, no you do not commit any sins anybody, you just become an angel you can call it as saint.  The religion is inside which enlighten and if you are a Christian, you become real Christian; if you are Hindu, you become real Hindu and the all the system which is inside is enlightened in such way that you just don't do wrong thing. For example I have known so many people who came to me who were drug addicts and overnight, over night, after Self-realization they have given up. Alcoholism, all bad habits, all kinds of diseases are cured, even cancer, even AIDS. I must say this is not that difficult because their mentality is different but it has cured many diseases and you feel your well being when you get your Self-realization.          

Interviewer -  Shri Mataji, what would happen to those who don't hear the call, pay attention to these special times?

Shri Mataji - See, it is Judgement and human beings are free to judge. They want to come to reality they can come, if they don't want to come we cannot force, we cannot force. You have to respect the freedom of their choice, whatever they want to do but  those you won't come - I don't know what will happen to them but they will be in the same problems that they had and as you see this world is getting destroyed from within so to get out of it is the better idea. 

Interviewer -  And America plays a very important role in this new time as a communicator?

Shri Mataji - Of course, this is a country of Communication. The other day somebody asked a question, Why should America be a Policemen everywhere?Jolly well it has to be because that's the character it is born. Is this centre is America and because America is not alright I have a problem. So, this is the centre is for all kinds of communications and for collectivity. Always you’ll find Americans bear the collective responsibilities of the world problems, sometime they make mistakes, it's different, but by nature they have to do it, they can't help it, that is their nature.

Interviewer -  It has been said that you are the Holy Ghost? 

Shri Mataji - Ya. 

Interviewer - Is this true?

Shri Mataji - You are in this part. I have to say that I must be something, Isn't it? After all, when I am giving realization to thousands of people I must be something and some people must have found out something. But as far as the people are concerned I would say I’ve learnt a lesson because Christ who was the son of God was crucified, who said who was the son of God. Mohammad Sahab was given poison, everybody was troubled like this. Now, I don't want to get crucified, I want to do my work till I live alright so that's why I don't want to say anything, once you get your Self-realization you will find out who am I?  

Interviewer - May we do that right now?

Shri Mataji - Yes why not? Why not? First you have to put your shoes away because the Mother Earth helps us a lot. Now, please put both your hands towards me like this. Left hand towards me in a very comfortable position you can put it on your lap you have to become very comfortable you don't have to go to Himalayas as we have said it, you have to become comfortable and right hand you have to give realization in a way that left hand is for your desire and right hand is for your action. In the same way your feet should be away from each other if you are sitting on the chair but if you are on the ground it’s alright. Now please put your left hand towards me like this and the right hand on your heart. We have to nourish our centres only on the left hand side; in the heart resides the spirit. Now if you become the spirit, you become your own master so take down your right hand upper portion of your abdomen; here is the centre of your mastery created by all the prophets and all the incarnations. Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. This is the centre for pure divine knowledge, pure divine knowledge. This you will understand later on when you will come to our centres, they will explain to you everything and you can find out everything about this knowledge which is like an ocean. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen again on the left hand side. Now raise it on your heart, now you have to put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Now take your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head, this is a centre where you have to forgive everyone now take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head, here without counting your mistakes or feeling guilty you have to ask forgiveness from the all pervading divine power. Now stretch your arm, stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please put down your head and now push back your fingers and move your scalp clockwise slowly, push back your finger so there is a good pressure on your scalp, now put down your head and now move your scalp slowly clockwise. That’s all we have to do.

Now put the right hand on your heart, here in your heart you have to ask a question, a very fundamental question about yourself, you close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you, here please ask a question in your heart you can call me Mother or Shri Mataji. Mother, am I the spirit? Ask this question 3 times. If you become the spirit you become your own master, your own guru. So now take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. Keep your eyes shut and ask another fundamental question about yourself, Mother am I my own master? Ask 3 times. Now take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard, at this point you have to ask 6 times because this centre has got 6 petals. I must say I respect your freedom and the pure divine knowledge cannot be given to you by force so ask 6 times in your heart, Mother please give me pure divine knowledge - 6 times. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. We have to open these upper centres with our self-confidence. So here you have to say with full self confidence, Mother I am my own master. Please say it 10 times – Mother, I am my own master. I’ve already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, this conditioning but you are the pure spirit. So now raise your right hand on top of your heart and please say with full confidence. Mother, I am the pure spirit - say 10 times please - Mother 12 times, 12 times – Mother, I am the pure spirit. This all-pervading divine power is the ocean of compassion, ocean of knowledge and ocean of bliss and joy but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily forgiven by this power. So forgive yourself and raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right; this centre is really bad in America. Here you have to say with self-confidence 16 times. Mother, I am not guilty at all, please say this 16 times. I already told you whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands all your life. While those who have troubled you are happy but you are torturing yourself. Specially at this moment it’s very important that you forgive everyone in general because this centre is extremely constricted and if don't forgive it won't open and you will also miss the opportunity of your self-realization. So now take your right hand on top of your forehead across and put it down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say again from your heart not how many time, Mother, I forgive everyone in general, say it from your heart not how many time. Now you have to take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power for your own satisfaction without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes so please say again from your heart not how many times. Oh divine power, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me, please say this from your heart, from your heart not how many time - Oh! Divine power please forgive me if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly. Now the last centre is very important. You have to stretch your palm fully and then put the centre of your palm on the top of the fontanel bone area, now bend your head as far as possible. Here again I cannot force self-realization on you, you have to ask for it. So you move your scalp, if you stretch your fingers outwards there will be nice pressure and you move your scalp 7 times clockwise saying Mother, please give me Self-realization. That’s all.

Now please open your eyes, put both the hands towards me like this. Put right hand towards me and put down your head and see with the left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze like thing coming out of your fontanel bone area - the soft bone was there in your childhood just see. Now please don't put your hand on the top of the head, away from it. Now please put both the hands towards me like this and stop thinking you can do it. You can stop your thinking. You will feel a cool or hot breeze on your hands and you feel very relax, extremely relaxed. Now those who get realization like this have to know that it is the sprouting of the seed which has to grow into a tree so you have to come to our centres, there they will give you all the necessary knowledge, all the help that is needed to make your connection perfect.
