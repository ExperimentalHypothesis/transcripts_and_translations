[...] From the ancient times and for your information, the great [Vyasa] was the son of a fisherwoman, the one who wrote Gita. And Valmiki who wrote Ramayana was himself a fisherman. Then you know that Christ had twelve fishermen as his disciples.

If you’ve seen this place, how they are surrounded by beautiful nature, by these beautiful trees of coconuts, which represent the ‘shripala’, it is Sahasrara, and it is very amazing that no fruit will fall upon you. It does not fall even on an animal. They know when to fall down, it’s very surprising. People sleep under these trees; nobody has been hit, so far.
[Laughter]

So now we are in a beautiful surrounding. It is very conducive to our spiritual life and to our meditative efforts.

First of all, this makes you feel extremely small and very big. When you look at these trees, and you look at the nature, and look at the sun, you feel like you are one of them. When you look at the sea, you think, Now the little drop has become the sea. So this kind of beautiful feeling comes into you. And I wish you start your journey with this nice, deep and Arabian sea, you can see your Self completely and feeling very happy and relaxed.

I’m sorry we had to do all this tonight, though you have come after a long journey, but there is no other time when we can do it. So, you don’t mind keeping awake for a while. In England, even now, it’s evening time only.

We have to give bandhan to our, other Sahaja Yogis who are coming via Karachi, I don’t know why they took that route. But whatever it is, give them a bandhan and I hope they will be back soon.
May God bless you.

Then, I have another job: we have all the saris for all the ladies here. Put them together. I didn’t know how to solve this problem, it’s very difficult.
Now it’s all numbered. But I don’t know if you people know your numbers. One or two, three persons have to come up and see for themselves after taking these things, come up and take these saris and arrange it for all the ladies. We have calculated, I think, we have to pay about [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi] 425 rupees for this. For the four saris and for petticoats and for blouses, I think it’s not too much.
