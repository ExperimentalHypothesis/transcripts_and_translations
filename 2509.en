Shri Krishna Puja, Tannay (Switzerland), 28 August 1983.

Today we are celebrating here, in this holy land the birthday of Shri Krishna.
Shri Krishna is the ultimate of the fatherhood that I described you before, who came on this Earth and illustrated the ultimate of that. So, on this Earth, the highest fatherhood is Shri Krishna’s awareness. But in the Kingdom of God, we can say in the Heavens, or even above everything else, resides Sadashiva who does not take incarnations. He is one of the aspects, Shri Krishna is one of the aspects of Sadashiva which is the Father. And the Adi Shakti or the Holy Ghost is the other aspect of Sadashiva which is His power. So, when Shri Krishna incarnated on this Earth, an aspect of this Adi Shakti came on this Earth as Radha. She is the same who came as the Mother of Christ, and She gave the name of Christ as the surname of Shri Krishna, as if it is Krishna’s name, from Krishna. He’s called as “Krisht” in Indian languages, Krisht.  And I have told you before why he was called as Yeshu or Jesu.
So, today we are going to see to the two aspects of Shri Krishna, which were the manifestation of His divine birth.
In Rama’s life they showed a man; a Purushottama, the best of the father in worldly affairs. And in Shri Krishna’s life they showed Him the highest fatherhood as in Yogeshwara or in divine work. So, the first aspect of Shri Krishna we have to understand is the Yogeshwara and the second aspect of him as the Virata.
Yogeshwara means the Lord of the Yoga, or the Power of Yoga. He is called because He reached the optimum that one has to reach as a yogi. As if He is the ideal you have to reach.
Now as a yogi, He was born of a royal family but He lived in the jungles, in the forests, with the cows, with ordinary people. He used to sleep on the ordinary places like sometimes on the stones, on the grass, when He would go with His cows for their feeding. Secondly, He was very aware, very very aware, absolutely aware of His powers, without any ego. He had a special power called “Samhara shakti” by which He could destroy all those people who tried to harm the divine manifestation.
This “Samhara shakti” is expressed as the Chakra (Sudarshan) in His hand. And another is the “Gada” (Mace) in His hand.
These two powers were within Him, and He acted according to the power of Radha, because She is the one who sustained the power of Shri Krishna. The proof of that is when He was in Gokul with Radha He did all His ‘samhara’ work. And afterwards He just became a chariot-driver for Arjuna. So, for His disciple Arjuna, He became even a chariot-driver.
Another great quality of Yogeshwara was complete discretion power built-in. So, He knew who was a devil and who was not, who is good who is bad, who is possessed who is not possessed, who is innocent who is not. This was built-in within Him, this power of complete discrimination.
And He had a capacity more expressing His witnesshood, as a ‘Sakshi’. He had the capacity I mean, He was a Sakshi Himself. I should say this way is easier to understand. He was a Sakshi, He had the capacity of witnessing the whole world as a play.
At the time of Rama, Rama was one who got involved into his problems, to show as if he is a full human being so that human beings should not say that he was God so how could we accept God because ‘he was God after all’?
Now this capacity in Him to witness has to be seen in every yogi.
The element He controls is ether. We call it “Akasha” in Sanskrit. This ether as you know, we are using for our television, for our radio, for every sort of a collective work. So, we have to be in charge of the ether element as yogis. And that is the subtlest of all, in the sense that you permeate into everything with that, and is above all. Like plastic also permeates into everything, into matter, into everything up to the air. But it cannot enter into ether. So, the negativity cannot enter into ether. So, when you enter into your ethereal zone, you actually enter into the area which is thoughtless awareness. So, to achieve your ethereal state, you have to expand your thoughtless awareness. And the sustenance of that is done by Christ, by the Spirit. So, you can realize now as a yogi, your state of mind should be ethereal.
And what should be the state of your super-ego? This is the ego part of it. That you should be in ethereal state.
And as a super-ego you should see it as a play, you should see the play of the negative. Negativity will run away, but don’t get involved into it, don’t play into their hands. Then the negativity will separate from you.
So, the ego and the super-ego both rise from the Vishuddhi Chakra.  They can be receded by the Agnya Chakra but have to be sucked into the Vishuddhi. The greatest quality of Yogeshwara is that He is not at all involved into it, detached, absolutely.
If He eats His food, He does not eat it. If He speaks, He does not speak. If He sees, He does not see. If He hears, He does not hear. It has no effect on Him, no retention on Him, no action on Him. Whatever He is, He is complete: sixteen petals is complete moon, sixteenth day of the moon is the Purnima. That is how one has to be, complete in oneself, complete confidence in oneself. But confidence should not be confused with ego. But confidence is complete wisdom, it’s complete dharma, it is complete love, complete beauty, and is complete God. That’s what it should be.
Now when He said that “you give up all your dharmas and surrender to Me” in Gita, what He was meaning is that all other things about which you are worried “You give up and become one with me, so I look after you”. Give up the responsibility to Shri Krishna, so the complete integrated Divinity will start expressing through you. Means if you say that you have to be responsible, then He says alright, go ahead, try! But if you say that “You are responsible, I’m just an institution or an instrument in Your hand”, then you start manifesting it well. And that is how your Vishuddhi Chakra gets opened up.
This is some part of the Yogeshwara I have spoken to you. But as He is the brain within us, He becomes the brain within us.
We have to know that all the qualities of a divine brain are within. So, whatever we do with our brain like intrigue, thieving, the deception, all which are bad things by your brain as they call it, are done by Him for the divine purpose without getting any blemish upon himself.
And the other side of it, so called positive, like politics, diplomacy or leadership, all that is His own doing, like even the thinking of the future and all that. He does planning, thinking, all those things, administration. As a play, everything is done as a play, because He’s the Master, as we call, a “sutra dhara”, the one who does the prologue in a drama. The one who plays with the strings with the pantomimes.
Now the other thing that we have to understand Shri Krishna at this stage of Sahaja Yoga, that it is the Virata Shakti that is manifesting at this time and not the Shri Krishna Shakti which was at His time. And the power that is working here is no more that of Radha or of Mary, but of Viratangana. That’s why the knowledge of Sahaja Yogis is much wider than the knowledge of all the saints of ages. But it is not deeper than them. If you can deepen your knowledge, this wider knowledge will have proper roots within you.
So, the brain are the roots, here are the roots of the whole tree of life. Actually, Kundalini comes up and waters the brain first, so that the whole tree of life is drenched in the Divine Bliss and Divine Knowledge.
So, this Virata Shakti that we have to work out gives us the sense of collective consciousness first. First, we understand it through our brain power.
But the whole brain power is to be guided by the Heart, is to be watered; but in Sanskrit is a very beautiful word “sinchan”, like dewdrops sprayed with the Love of God. So, the integration of this brain has to take with Heart and with your liver. Then only the Virata-Shakti takes another form. The weapons of killing become the weapons of forgiveness. Every sort of destructive power is used for the construction. As if it is tricked.
Like now I told them a trick, how to trick these gurus. The power that they have can be tricked against them, as is said that their teeth must be put into their necks, into their throats, instead of taking out their teeth better put them back into their throats. And if you can do that, then there is no problem as far as their effect on us is concerned because you are more powerful and more trickier.
Because the Virata Shakti has now taken that form, like the tree when it grows, it grows upward. But when it is leaden with fruit, it comes down. First it is attractive by its flowers, by its timber, by the other parts of its body. And people try to destroy it for it. But when the fruits appear, they want to preserve it, and the tree bends down, with humility, is very valuable.
So, you are the fruits. That Viratangana Shakti, you are the fruits. Because you are so valuable that those people who wanted to ruin or to destroy the Divine power from this Earth will start thinking that they have to gain something out of these fruits.
So today the Virata Shakti has given you a great value, because people see that by having one sahaja yogi with them it is so precious. Say one ordinary man gets his Realization. Then he develops his value. In that, his own values, he can be respected, loved, and given the highest- if he’s a proper Sahaja-Yogi.
So, you should understand today, that Virata Shakti is :”we are going to worship that Virata Shakti which has given fruits”. As a result of that, all these different churches, fanaticism, atheism, communism and all that-ism will neutralize, because they will see their benefit in it. But you have to become that. That is the biggest thing one has to know is to bend down towards the Mother Earth, to be humble. Absolutely the humility inside out, is really going to give you the complete value of Sahaja-Yoga fruits.
Those sahaja-yogis who boast about themselves are like the fruits which are getting ruined only on the tree. The only fruits, which bend down, are accepted as good and matured fruits, and not those who assert that they are the highest. But some of the negative people should not by any chance take advantage of this and say that they are good because they are bending down. It’s not the logic. Some of them pose they are humble; even a rotten fruit bends down. But the mature fruit shows its humility by its weight. That is the guru tattva weight.
So, from the Viratangana Power, we get the power of maturity up to the fruit and then we become blessed by guru principle. Those who are still involved in getting to better sunshine or getting to better water supply or all these things, are not yet matured, because the fruit doesn’t need anything anymore. It doesn’t need anything from the Mother Earth, nor from the elements. But it surrenders, it bends, it bows to the Mother Earth.
So, the sahaja-yogi who goes on asking questions to Mother, bringing personal problems, stupid ideas, negativity, all those people are still not yet the fruits.
But the matured people are those who surrender, who bow to the Mother Earth. So, the capacity to bow is the best judgement of yourself. And leaving everything to the power of gravity of your Mother to do every work for you. And leaving all your small little worries behind. You have to rise above these restricting powers and achieve the completion of this Virata Shakti which ultimately becomes a “Madhura Shakti”. “Madhura”; there is no word in English language, but it means a “sweet power”. Like the fruit becomes sweet. That’s how you all have to become very sweet. Krishna tried to make everything very sweet in the sense it was all Madhura Shakti that was acting. All His play, all His dancing, all His stories if you read, is nothing but Madhura Shakti, towards Gopas and Gopis, towards other Sahaja Yogis.
So, you have to keep your Mother pleased by pleasing all Sahaja-yogis and not other people. They are not important. So today we are going to shorten the Puja and that’s why it took so much time upstairs, to shorten it. [Shri Mataji is laughing] So the time lost is time gained for ever and ever. [Shri Mataji is laughing]
May God bless you all.

Now let’s start fast, you see, there’s not much to be done. Just wash-

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi, then puja starts]
Gregoire explain Gayatri Mantra in presence of Shri Mataji and yogis.

Grégoire on Gayatri Mantra during Shri Krishna Puja Geneva, August 28 1983, translated from French (original content of the tape in French and English follows the translation).

Shri Mataji: A good speech, I think. It was a good speech. I hope you have recorded it.”
Yogis : Yes, Mother.
Grégoire: Gayatri Mantra, Mother
Shri Mataji: “All right, you tell them.
Grégoire: We are now going to say the Gayatri Mantra that I would like to explain to you. First I will say it and then give you the meaning.
Shri Mataji : Read it loudly, they can’t hear it. The Italians also can understand if somebody translates in Italian language. Come along! Ruth?... All right anyone, anyone? But they can understand you? Italians can understand French? All right.”
Grégoire:
Aum bhu aum bhuva aum svah aum ma aum jana aum tapa aum satyam aum tat Savitru varenyam bhargo devasya dheemayee dhyo yona prachodayat Aum apo jyoti rasomrutam Brahma Bhur Bhuva swarom.

Shri Mataji explained me...”
Shri Mataji: This is a right sided uh, thing, is right sided.
Grégoire : Shri Mataji explained me that this invocation
Shri Mataji : Loudly.
Grégoire : Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji : I think you get up and speak.
Grégoire: I was trying not to speak too loud, Mother, because of the neighbors have been complaining ... ] Shri Mataji explained me that this Mantra is an invocation to summon up first of all the power of the right side because it is addressed to the causal principles of all the elements.
Bhur is the causal principle of the earth and expresses itself at the level of the Mooladhara Chakra.
Bhuva is the causal principle of cosmos expressing thus the creation and the chakra to which this causal principle corresponds is Swadishthana.
Swaha, as you know, corresponds to the fire element that consumes – that has that power to consume as the Nabhi Chakra consumes the elements in the fire of digestion.
Mah is the causal principle of ...
Shri Mataji : Tape him also. Are you taping him ? Grégoire, you’d better tape it because this is for the first time. (handing him the mike) I don’t need it now. Let us give it to him. From the very beginning, Grégoire ...
Yogi: It’s picking it out from here, I’ll make sure.
Shri Mataji: Is it? All right.
Gregoire: Mah is the causal principle of the almighty power of love and, as this power is almighty, Maha expresses as well the greatness. Maha is the causal principle of the air element. It corresponds to the Heart Chakra.
Jana is the causal principle of collective consciousness and it corresponds – as Shri Mataji has said – to the ether element. It is the principle which comes to its historical manifestation now with the age of the Aquarius. It is with this principle that Sahaja yogis can come into relationship through their new collective consciousness.
Tapa is at the level of Agnya the principle of Light which as you know “Tapasya” expresses as well austerities. And it is what Christ has expressed in His life, a life full of extraordinary austerities in order to purify through his light. Tapa is purification.
What the Vedic sages were doing long time ago is to address those causal principles because they had yet no knowledge allowing them to get related to the deities at the level of each chakra. Only Shri Mataji has brought this knowledge. Thus by addressing the causal principles they addressed the formless aspect of a God of which the formal aspect is the chakra’s deity.
Shri Mataji: So, Hiranyagarbha is the egg, you see, it is one after another. It starts exploding. The innermost core explodes first, you see like that, goes on exploding one after another. Till now, historically you have reached this stage where the satyam is exposed.
Grégoire: All those egg shells {tape unclear] originate in the first. In a way they exploded one into the other until they had covered the totality of the created universe. Thus the universe in the beginning was called Hiranyagarbha, that is the Golden Egg and it is a name of Brahmadeva. If you take a longitudinal section you find all the universes like Bhuvar Loka, Swahar Loka, Maha Loka, Jana Loka, Tapar Loka et Satya Loka.
Those various universes are different parts of the three worlds: the terrestrial world, the celestial world... We have reached, as Shri Mataji says, where this process of progressive openings of the shells has lead us : at the level of Satyam that is the manifestation of Sahaja Yoga.
I’ll repeat once more the mantra now that you have understood its meaning:
Aum bhu aum bhuva aum svah aum ma aum jana aum tapa aum satyam aum tat Savitru varenyam bhargo devasya dheemayee dhyo yona prachodayat Aum apo jyoti rasomrutam Brahma Bhur Bhuva swarom.

After the talk, during Ganesha Puja (original):

Shri Mataji: “ A good speech, I think. It was a good speech. I hope you have recorded it.”
Yogis : “Yes, Mother.”
Grégoire: “Gayatri Mantra, Mother”
Shri Mataji: “Alright, you tell them.”
G. :“Nous allons dire maintenant le Gayatri Mantra que j’aimerais vous expliquer. Je vais d’abord le dire, ensuite je vous en explique la signification. »
Shri Mataji :  «Read it loudly, they can’t hear it. The Italians also can understand if somebody translates in Italian language. Come along! Ruth?... Alright anyone, anyone? But they can understand you? Italians can understand French? Alright.”
G.: “Le Mantra :
aum bhu aum bhuva aum svah aum ma aum jana aum tapa aum satyam aum tat Savitru varenyam bhargo devasya dheemayee dhyo yona prachodayat Aum apo jyoti rasomrutam Brahma Bhur Bhuva swarom.
Shri Mataji m’a expliqué...”
Shri Mataji: “This is a right sided uh, thing, is right sided.”
G.: “Shri Mataji m’a expliqué que cette invocation [Shri Mataji : « Loudly. » G. : « Yes Mother. » Shri Mataji : « I think you get up and speak. » G. : “I was trying not to speak too loud, Mother, because of the neighbors have been complaining... »] Shri Mataji m’a expliqué que ce Mantra est une invocation pour mobiliser avant tout le pouvoir du côté droit car elle s’adresse aux principes causals de tous les éléments.
Bhur est le principe causal de la terre et s’exprime au niveau de la Mooladhara Chakra.
Bhuva est le principe causal du cosmos exprimant ainsi la création et le Chakra auquel ce principe causal correspond est le Swadishthana.
Swaha, comme vous le savez correspond à l’élément du feu qui consume – qui a ce pouvoir de consumer, de même que le Nabhi Chakra dans le feu de la digestion consume les éléments.
Mah est le principe causal du pouvoir [Shri Mataji : « Tape him also. Are you taping him ? Grégoire, you’d better tape it because this is for the first time.(handing the mike) I don’t need it now. Let us give it to him. From the very beginning, Grégoire...” Yogi: “It’s picking it out from here, I’ll make sure.” Shri Mataji: “Is it? Alright.”]
Mah est le principe causal du pouvoir tout puissant de l’amour et parce que ce pouvoir est tout puissant, Maha exprime aussi la grandeur. Maha est le principe causal de l’élément de l’air. Il correspond au Chakra du cœur.
Jana est le principe causal de la conscience collective et il correspond, ainsi que Shri Mataji l’a dit, à l’élément éthérique. C’est le principe qui vient à son – à sa manifestation historique maintenant dans l’ère du Verseau et c’est avec ce principe que les Sahaja Yogis peuvent entrer en relation par leur nouvelle conscience collective.
Tapa est au niveau de l’Agnya chakra le principe de la lumière qui comme vous le savez « Tapasya » exprime aussi les austérités. Et c’est bien cela que le Christ a [?exprimé] dans sa vie, c’est une vie d’austérité tout à fait extraordinaire afin de pouvoir par sa lumière purifier. Tapa est la purification.
Satyam est le principe causal de la vérité, de la vérité exposée et le Chakra qui correspond est évidemment le Sahasrara Chakra.
Ce que les sages védiques faisaient autrefois, c’est qu’ils s’adressaient à ces principes causals car ils n’avaient pas encore la connaissance qui leur permettait d’entrer en relation avec les déités au niveau de chaque Chakra. Seule Shri Mataji a apporté cette connaissance. Ainsi en s’adressant aux principes causals ils s’adressaient à l’aspect informé du dieu dont l’aspect formel est la déité du Chakra. »
Shri Mataji : « So, Hiranyagarbha is the egg, you see, it is one after another. It starts exploding. The innermost core explodes first, you see like that, goes on exploding one after another. Till now, historically you have reached this stage where the Satyam is exposed.”
G.: “Toutes ces coquilles d’oeuf [tape unclear] à l’origine du premier. En quelque sorte ils explosent l’un dans l’autre jusqu’à ce qu’ils couvrent la totalité de l’univers créé. C’est ainsi que l’univers, au début, est appelé Hiranyagarbha, c’est-à-dire l’œuf doré et c’est un des noms de Brahmadeva. Si on coupe cet œuf longitudinalement on trouve tous les univers comme Bhuvar Loka, Swahar Loka, Maha Loka, Jana Loka, Tapar Loka et Satya Loka. Tous ces divers univers correspondent aux parties qui composent les trois mondes : le monde terrestre, le monde céleste... Nous sommes, comme le dit Shri Mataji arrivés où ce processus d’ouvertures progressives de ces coquilles nous a conduit : au niveau de Satyam qui est la manifestation de Sahaja Yoga.
Je répète ce Mantra encore une fois maintenant que vous en avez compris la signification:

aum bhu aum bhuva aum svah aum ma aum jana aum tapa aum satyam aum tat Savitru varenyam bhargo devasya dheemayee dhyo yona prachodayat Aum apo jyoti rasomrutam Brahma Bhur Bhuva swarom.

Shri Mataji : « Now you start Mahaganapati because the thing is you have started now washing the feet. Start Mahaganapati.”
