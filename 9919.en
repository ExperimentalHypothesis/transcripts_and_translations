Shri Mataji: Now Shri Ganesha prayer first, just the names, just the prayer will do, just tell them that we have to first establish the innocence and innocence is Shri Ganesh who incarnated on the earth as Jesus Christ.

Sahaja Yogi: Perhaps you would like to tell them Mother.

Shri Mataji: Ah.

Sahaja Yogi: Maybe you would like to tell them

Shri Mataji: All right. We do two things today, only because there is short of time.

Shri Mataji: First, we have to establish the innocence and to establish the innocence the deity is called as Shri Ganesh and you will know about him much more, but you know him as Jesus Christ because he incarnated on this earth as Jesus Christ. Now this prayer that he is going to read to you was written about 14,000 years back and see how detailed it is described about Christ and it is described in a book called Devi Purana by Markandeya and is called as Devi Bhagwat. So, you can see all these things written there. So to know about Christ we cannot limit ourselves to Bible, because he was such a great personality that you cannot contain him in a little book like Bible you see, so you have to go to other scriptures also and keep your mind open about it, so now he will read it out to you and with that they will wash my feet so this water will be vibrated and this water can be used for purposes like if you want to say use it for your baptism its very good because it works out faster if you put it on your head, on your hands, the vibrations start flowing. See it’s a simple method that you get the vibrated water. And then another thing we’ll do is to establish the power, the shakti, what you call the goddess and for that they will be washing my hands with some things that are prescribed (ghee should not be kept on a thing like that, it isn’t proper, have you got another yoghurt? Don’t use this)

Sahaja Yogi: Get some fresh yoghurt and put it into even a porcelain or something.

Shri Mataji: Not in this, never use in a brass. So, these things are, then the hands are washed and then the hands also have got vibrations so this water can be used for the clearing of the stomach and the stomach centres and all the problems of the stomach. Also, if you have been to a wrong guru or anything, that clears it out. Alright, this is the 2 things we can do today because there is shortage of time. Then we will do a little fire ceremony in which we will burn off all the problems that are within us by evoking the ascendants, power within us, the powers of ascendants you will know. He’ll translate it to you so you will know in English its not kept in Sanskrit language, so let’s wash.

Sahaja Yogi: So, we begin with reading its called the Divine Essence of the Prayer. This is the prayer about which Shri Mataji spoke when she was talking about Lord Ganesha.

Let our ears hear that which is true. Let our eyes see that which is pure. Let our beings praise that which is divine; and let those who listen hear not my voice, but the wisdom of God.

Shri Mataji: Why don’t you stand up?

Sahaja Yogi: Let us worship with the same song, the same strength and the same knowledge.

Shri Mataji: Listen with concentration.

Sahaja Yogi: Let our meditation enlighten and enrich. Let there be amongst us compassion and peace.

Now the prayer:

Salutation Shri Ganesha, sakshat Shri Jesus.

Shri Mataji: 'Sakshat' meaning 'in reality'.

Sahaja Yogi: Sakshat Shri Jesus, Sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi namo namaha.

It is You who is the beginning of all the beginnings. It is You who is the doer of all deeds which have been done, are being done, and will be done. It is You who supports all things that are supported. It is You who protects all things that are protected. It is You who is the complete, All-pervading Spirit, God’s divine energy. Think clearly brain; speak only the truth. Let your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, speak. Let your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, listen. Let your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, bless.

Shri Mataji: Is a divinity should be awakened so that you listen through your divinity and not through your ego and superego, your conditionings.

Sahaja Yogi: Let your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, protect. Let your presence, awakened by Kundalini in us, your disciples, be the disciple. You are the essence of all the sacred literature and holy words, and You are the energy that understands the holy words. You are the divine combination of complete truth, complete happiness and complete energy; and You are beyond. You are all knowledge, and You are the use to which the knowledge is put. You exist until the end of all things, and after the end of all things You are.

Shri Mataji: Don’t touch the water.

Sahaja Yogi: You create the end of all things, and after the end of all things, You remain indifferent. You are the earth. You are the water. You are the fire. You are the air. And You are the space above the air.

Shri Mataji: Because he is the essence of everything.

Sahaja Yogi: You are the gunas. You are beyond the gunas. You are the body and You are beyond the body. You are the essence of time and You are beyond time. You and only You exist at the Mooladhara chakra. You are the Spirit and You are beyond the Spirit; and those who would join God meditate upon You. You are Brahman, Vishnu, and Shiva.

Shri Mataji: The 3 principles, by one you create then another you sustain and third one you desire, that is Gods desire.

Sahaja Yogi: You are Indra, Agni, and Vayu. You are the sun at noon. You are the full moon. Through all of these and more, You are the All-pervading energy of innocence and wisdom. You are the divine servant who stoops to wash the feet of saints. You are the tiny core of all things,without which the larger have no purpose. You are the key to the libraries of all the scriptures, without which the truth is hidden. You are the full stop which completes the sentence, and without which the sentence loses its meaning. You are the crescent moon, You are the stars and You are beyond the stars; all things, from tiny dot to universe, is You. You are the future and beyond the future; You are in all forms. You are where the sounds combine. You are the silence between the sounds. You are the rhythm of all music and all prayers.

This is the knowledge of Nirmal Ganesha, and You, Nirmal Ganesha, are the master of that knowledge, and all knowledge.

You are the God and You are the Goddess.

Aum Gam Nirmal Ganapataye

To your powers, Ganesha, let all surrender. Let the left-side of memory and the right-side of action surrender to You and let your enlightenment prevail.

Your first tooth You have, and four hands: one holding a rope, the second a goad, the third is raised in blessing and the fourth offers sustenance. Your banner is that of a humble mouse. You have long ears and are clothed in red; red decorates You and You are worshipped with red flowers. You have compassion for those who love You, and it is for those who love You that You have come to this earth. You are the force that creates, the energy that pervades and the Spirit that protects. Those who seek union with God pray through You; those who seek union with God worship You.

To your powers, Om Jesus, let all surrender; let the left side of memory and the right side of action surrender to You and let your enlightenment prevail. You are the Word that was the beginning; You are the Word that will be the ending.

Shri Mataji: Omega and Alpha, you see Alpha and Omega is written down

Sahaja Yogi: You are He who was born of a virgin, and died on the cross; You are He who absorbs all sins, and who died to live again. You are God and man, and You are worshipped with red flowers. You have compassion for those who love You, and it is for those who love You that You came to this earth. You are the force that creates, the energy that pervades and the Spirit that protects. Those who seek union with God pray through You; those who seek union with God worship You.

Shri Mataji: From the fire that’s the best part of it.

Sahaja Yogi: Going to say the mantra which is of the fire itself of Agni Devata.
