Talk to Sahaja Yogis, First Darshan, Englewood Ashram, NJ. 1985 – 06 – 01
Formal Talk: Role of Women, Shakti Power, Women in America
 
​First of all, Sahaja Yogis have no business to feel guilty, especially when you are on the land of Shri Krishna. That’s an anti-Krishna activity. When Krishna is not awakened, then it is alright. That if he is awaken within us, then it’s not alright at all. Both things are wrong. To be guilty as well as make others guilty. To be guilty and to be aggressive, both things are wrong. For this, one must understand that all centers have got their own countries, and a country is called as “Desh” in Sanskrit language. And when it is enlightened, it is called as “Pradesh”. So if we have to make America a Pradesh, it’s not a very easy task. All kinds of anti-Krishna activities are done by people who live here. And so to make it a Pradesh, first we have to make it a Desh, and then we can make it a Pradesh.
​As I say that Canada is the left side of the Vishuddi. And also left or the right we can say because all the minerals, all the earthly qualities of Canada exploited by America. So whatever is their own is like taking out of your flush and eating it up, and feeling for you. All kinds of aggressive qualities of the right side are done. Now to bring them to proper level, nature itself acts. Whenever they try these activities, nature acts against them. Politics acts against them. Economics acts against them. But they don’t realize that there is something basically wrong in what they are doing. We must go along our nature as we are. So we are the people of America who represent the quality of Vishuddi chakra. Vi-shudda. Shudda is purity. Vi-shudda means absolutely enlightened with purity. So it makes you smile at the whole thing.
​Absolutely – Vishudda. Vishudda means absolutely clean, enlightened by knowledge, absolutely clean. So now you will understand what I am saying that is all anti-God activities we are doing. And these things are taken over by the whole world. Because it is Virat also. People try to accept what good or bad America is doing. When America was good, people like Abraham Lincoln were here. They accepted democracy, Virat; it’s a Virat, people of the people, the government of the people, by the people, for the people. It’s the idea of Virat which was accepted. But anti-Virat activity is that we are very individualistic. So much so that every bathroom different, every car different, every door different, you don’t know how to handle things, very individualistic and very grossly individualistic now. So one has to understand that for Vishuddi chakra there are sixteen petals. The eye, the nose, the tongue – which is very important. Tongue is the most important thing, the ears, throat, all these are governed by Vishuddi chakra. In every country, people do something wrong against the Vishuddi chakra. But the maximum is in America, and Canada. They are selling all the time, digging out from the Mother Earth to this America. Accepting the aggression of America on them is wrong, and when America is doing to them is also wrong. Both things are wrong. So the responsibility of Sahaja Yogi in these two countries is the greatest of all. In other countries, not so bad. I would say Indians are also quite individualistic in certain things, like food. Food is very important to them. Very particular on the taste of the food, Indians are. Very particular. I was telling just now that before coming for my work to America, I have to cook for my husband. Four thirty I got up, cooked everything, put everything in the freezer, came away, because taste is important. He can’t get over it. He is a powerful man; he can’t get over his taste. Indians haven’t got power that much to overpower their taste. For taste, they go anywhere. But that’s only one problem. Also could be they tell lies very easily. It is another problem of the tongue. So let’s say the tongue is quite a big problem for Indians. But here, the eyes, the eyes are bubbling all the time. It’s very funny. You can’t see anyone with steady eye. The whole face is going into a kind of a nervous twitching. Eyes are never steady. Just going round and round and round. I don’t know what they are looking at. And everything is done to see that your eyes are ruined.
​Eyes are something to do with optic chiasma, which has something to do with your thinking. Because here the human beings are more mental being created like that, made like that. They don’t know how they are conditioned. They are mentally conditioned. Now they make images. They make an image of a person. For them, such and such person is the perfect epitome or something. Like take a question of having skinny women. In India, it is difficult to marry a skinny woman. If there is, a somebody is a skinny woman, tell them baba, God knows what disease she has, she must be hot tempered, she must be irritable by nature, (talking in Hindi). There are so many words to describe, Cabadi, this that. Just such a girl is not regarded as of marriageable temperament. But here is skinny girl is regarded. So I asked why is skinny girl what is she, she is, she is feminine. I said how? Is the right sidedness. If somebody is right sided, she becomes skinny. How can it be? So they said, no, because she is attractive to men. I mean, this is too much for a woman to think like that. I mean, what is the difference between a prostitute and a woman who wants to be attractive to all the men of the world. Horrible it is. To be in the desire of asking other men to be looking at you all the time is something I can’t understand. It is a serious thing. When they told me this, I was shocked. In India, not in the cities, I don’t know, if there that a particular part in the smaller cities, if any man looks at you, you will have to slap on the face. (Hindi Talking) Whole thing is so mental and so stupid. So mental and so stupid, and I think, they befool the women here nicely. It’s very surprising, you see, that they want to make women into prostitutes, and women has accepted such situation to be attractive to every man. Why? What is there? It’s an illusion they are created, an illusion about women, that she should be attractive to all men. What would they do with the attraction?
​So such illusive ideas are created. And mentally they have conditioned you into that illusions. So once you are in that illusions, you believe in it. What is the state of a person who is at the Vishuddi, is a Saakshi, is the, he is the witness. He witnesses everything, unless and until he beyond his illusion, how will he witness. All these conditionings, funny conditionings that have come onto the mind, have creeped the mind so much through Medias you can say. May be through writing. I don’t know how it has happened to sensible people like you. And then these ideas we have accepted, our images have become like that. And it is a very big problem, because these images do not tally with God’s images. And once you start accepting such horrible images at the perfect ones, then what happens to your society, that you become those images, which are artificial, which are anti-God. The woman has to be respectable, serine. Long long long time back, it was written (Sanskrit saying): where the women are respectable and are respected, there the Gods remain. So I think that is the beginning of the end. And then you say anything, they say so what.
I feel that in America, the women have to understand their role as good women, as moral women. That is very important, because they are becoming like men now. They are no more women. They called feminine. I tell you, they have nothing of a woman in them. And it is sometimes very sad the way the women start deciding for everything. In, on a television, if you see, with a husband wife, both are sitting, the wife talks and husband doesn’t talk. He sits like a small little doggie there. And the wife talks. Normally any Indian woman would hesitate to talk to another man. I mean, she is the potential energy. She is the Shakti. And man is the kinetic energy. When this kinetic energy is not given its own position, then it is all wrong. Because they say there are two wheels on a chariot. One is meant for the left, and another for the right. So they have their faces like this. Now you cannot put it like this. The whole thing was wrong. Nobody is higher, lower. But they are not similar. They are two different things. Equal heights, equal weights, everything. But in attitudes, I mean, in facing, one is facing inward, another is facing outward you can say. So, right cannot go to the left, and left cannot go to the right. This is the beginning of the end I tell you. Once the role of Shakti changes, then it is very difficult to manage.
In no incarnation a male has come without a female. Christ came, He had His Mother. When Shri Krishna came, He had to have Radha. When Rama came, Sita was there. When Nanaka came, there had to be Nanaki. When Janaka came, He had to have Janaki as His Daughter. When Mohammad Sahib came, He had to have His Daughter Fatima. They could not do without the power because they are just the kinetic energy. But when the Goddess came, she came alone. Because she has the power to contain within herself all the powers. But has to be the potential power. Why? When we just start exchanging our roles, we create a very, very big problem. It is not easy for a Western mind to see this. It might have happened because once upon a time, the men tried to rule the women too much. As a reaction, that the women are behaving like this. Quite possible. In the north of India we have this. We have had this problem. But the most surprising thing is that people asked me questions in the interviews that too people believe you as a woman. I said why? Do they think you are equally reliable as a man? I mean, I am surprised. Here, women are dominating. Do they have the same respect for you, as they would have in a man? Can you imagine? In India, just the other way around. They will always respect a woman. If woman says something, that’s believed. She’s regarded as much more wiser than her husband. The husband will always take a council from the wife. So all these questions really blasted me. And I didn’t know what to answer. I was really flabbergasted. Because that culture in which I am brought up is very different from this culture. Where will they believe you if you are a woman. Say if there is a thief who comes in the house. If he sees the woman in India, he will go away. Or if there are people who come, to say, steal something, and the woman says not the house, they believe her and go. They will always believe a woman in India than a man. When the [extruders] came of refugees in India, I got some people to stay in My house. They were, one of them was Muslim. And it’s so happened that people who were fanatics who came down they found out from someone, that there is a Muslim staying in the house. So I went forward. I said can’t you see these thing, am I Muslim. They said no. Is there a Muslim staying with You. I said no. You have to believe Me. They went out. But if my husband had said, they never would have believed him.
​And then the women here who are even on a small position, this I discovered with a customs lady, she behaves in such a funny manner, and the man does not, we got into the aero plane, and there was a lady standing. She, I said I would like to sit here and I would like take this bag with me because it’s a small bag. We wanted to get out fast. No, you can’t take it. You can’t sit here. You can’t do this. So another fellow came. He said, listen to her. If she says so, if she wants to sit, and why not. There is a seat available, and if she wants to keep her luggage, it’s not big, why not? Why don’t you allow? Because they cannot contain. A woman can contain love, she can contain compassion, she can contain affection, she can contain all the forbearance, she can contain all the wisdom, but she cannot contain this kind of a power within herself. She becomes mad. So once you realize that we are not to change our roles in life, of course if you are working, all right work, but we are women. And man has to be a man. Here, you find men are becoming cabbages or homosexual or something like that. Thanks to the American women. As Sahaja Yoginis, we have to understand there is no joy in this kind of nonsense. I mean, I would hate to be a man. It’s a headache. I tell you. Woman has to just please her husband, one boss, poor man. But one must understand what you have got already as a woman, and then you play into their hands, you want to be attractive to all the men. What is this? Why? Why you want to play into their hands? It’s a complete slavery. I think.
​So all absurd ideas are more visible now and audible, about I think it has taken hardly twenty years to do that. So all that love, all that affection, all that compassion, all that peace, all that wisdom has vanished. Where are the women, who are the torchbearer of that? Children are insecure, husbands are insecure. As a result, wives are also insecure. And the kind of domination now in a very subtle way is on women which they don’t realize, that they have to play into the hands of men. Whatever men say, whatever they like, they have to dress up like that. Because then you are not attractive. It’s prostitution. Why should we try to please so many men? It’s slavery. Women, when they lose their sense of chastity, they became slaves. It’s a continuous slavery going on. Such a pressure on the minds of women. Instead of looking after their head, they are looking after something nonsensical is to please all the men. Why? For what? You must see it in right perspective what I am saying. You are not independent. You are not free. [What is this? This is American music? Comes out of where? I don’t know?] And that has started this derailment. So this interviewer asked me what’s wrong with America. I didn’t know where to put my finger. But I think this is the derailment. Women have lost their power. They are responsible for the society. They are responsible to keep the society intact.
​There is a story written by Rabindranath Tahoe. Very interesting, about a writer. So he was telling his wife that I am writing a story where a man wants to “elogate” a girl. She said really that’s horrid. He said alright, if I had asked you to “elogate” me, what you would have done? She said I would have called the police. You know in India there were women who committed “Yohan.” You know, have you heard about that? You don’t know what it is? I must tell you. It’s very interesting. It’s a story of a lady called Padmini. Very beautiful woman. Of course she was beautiful because she was beautiful. Not to attract other men or women. She was just beautiful. That’s all. And one king who was an emperor, Muslim, they are also funny people, he heard about her beauty and he wanted to see her. She was very angry and everybody was angry that he said like this, that she was beautiful and all that. Indian women don’t like. If you really know an Indian woman, and if you tell her you look beautiful. If a woman says, it’s alright, but a man says, she won’t like it. Never says that to India to anyone. Otherwise, you are in for trouble. (Talking in Hindi). So this beautiful lady Padmini had such faith in herself. So she said alright, if so, ask him to come and see me in the mirror. So, they put her before the mirror, and he could see her reflection in the mirror. But he must be a modern man, emperor, he got excited with that, there is no feeling the serenity of this lady and soothing quality, he felt excited and now he decided that he will attack this country, unless and until they give him Padmini. It was too much for the men of that place to give their queen. So when this emperor attacked, he came near the fort, and he sent word that if you do not send Padmini to me, I will attack you in the fort. They decided they cannot do that. So Padmini said alright, she was also intelligent, she told her husband that you send a word that we are sending the queen, and you have hundred palanquins ready, and let four persons carry the palanquin. Inside all the weapons, and let every palanquin have another soldier inside. So, they are like that there are five soldiers. So five hundred soldiers. And the king sat in the first palanquin himself. So the palanquins entered inside the caravan where these people were all settled down, emperors, whole thing was settled down, big caravans all over. And they put down the palanquins, so they were all drunk, thinking that now so many ladies are coming, and we will have a nice time. When they opened the palanquins, soldiers came out and killed them one by one. They fought, fought but could not do any better, because they were only five hundred people. They have told these ladies that in case we get lost, you will know because there won’t be any fire, so at till four o clock you should wait to see some fire. And if we win, we will lit up a fire for you. So they waited till four o clock, there was no fire, so they made a fire, huge fire, and three thousand women burned themselves alive, before any man could touch them, inclusive of Padmini, not very old, hardly this must have happened four hundred years back.
​So now you will realize what women are losing, and how men have in a very subtle way, dominated them. You just don’t care for all these things. Men cannot produce children, can they? They can’t exist without women. But you don’t play to their hands like this. Men will not, they say expect, respect a woman who is serene, is not a fact. They only respect a serene woman, and not a cheap woman, at all. I have seen in all my life like that. So the responsibility of the woman, as I told you last time, and again, I repeat it, the more I come to America, the more I feel this is the problem. Is the mother who teaches the children how to behave. Is the mother who gives the compassion and discipline to children. Is the mother who gives stability to the husband. Is the mother who get us to everything that is the social life. And what’s wrong with America is nothing that our social life is zero. You are getting destroyed, completely destroyed. So as a mother only you can control the whole world. You see, your, you, I am a Mother, I am a Woman, I don’t dominate people, do I? I can work out without domination because people do not care for domination. What they care for is love. They hanger after love. These are all temporary faces, will disappear. But it will leave a very, very bad mark on the history of human beings of America. Maybe if people do not take to Sahaj style of life, maybe you will find the whole of this country will be completely finished in no time. So very serious danger. All kinds of funny diseases are coming. Will not be destroyed by Russians, no. No atom bomb going to destroy us. We are going to destroy ourselves because our powers have become cheap. They have lost their faith in themselves. So it is for men also to realize to respect their women. Not for something very, very cheap and frivolous, but for something that they are, the shaktis. Unless and until the men understand this simple thing, you cannot save your society.
​Sahaja Yogis alright. But for Sahaja Yogis, it is very important that they must develop the proper balance of family life, proper balance, it’s very important. That is the real wise thing we can do. Save ourselves, and by our example we can save others. I am happy now you have some Indians with you. I hope they are not westernized. They are keeping to certain good things. There is nothing to learn as far as economics and politics is concerned in India, they don’t know that, but definitely the society, the social side. It’s very important. And if there is no society, there cannot be a nation. There will be [a anarchy]. Thus the ascent in a Sahaj life should be a balanced, proper, married life. Concentrated, deep, married life is very important. And then you will be surprised that you will enjoy so many things because all wasteful things are gone and finished. Like a lady who was coming to Sahaja Yoga, suddenly she started buying very good tapes, and very good tape recorder, this that. And I said, how did you manage? She said mother, now I don’t do anything, even one of these things. I don’t need any makeup, this that. I don’t waste my time in diet nonsense, but I use it now for good purpose. And such people can never have money problem because is Lakshmi Tattwa. Of course women should not dress up like beggars, of course not. They should not. They should be like Lakshmis. They should not be behaved like beggars at all. They should not be parasites. They should be dignified mothers. And a motherhood is the epitome of the growth of a woman. And not her bridal dress, permanent bridal dress. It’s not even a bride. It’s something dirty, filthy. So that’s what Sahaja Yoga is, and we should get up for our motherhoods. We have to even mother our husbands. That has to be done.
Thus, we will revive this social values in America. And even if there are hundred people as you are, if you have done it, we will do it for the rest of them, it can be channelized. But you must understand that what I am saying is a serious matter. And you don’t know what a disease it is, that you have to work out. It is a disease. You make your men weak with that. You, yourselves are weak. You make your children weak. And God knows what makes you think that domination in the gross way is of any help. It’s nothing to compete with them. They are different and we are different. So what is there to compete? Once we accept our situation, as women and as men, we become beautiful part and parcels of the whole. That is this Virat. That’s what one has to. Ratha herself was Ratha. “Ra” is the energy. “Tha” is the one who sustains the energy. Without Her, He could not kill the Kansa. Do you know that? He had to ask Her now enter into My Being. Otherwise, I cannot kill him. If He could exist without Her powers, He would not had Her there. Not only that, afterwards, He had to get His sixteen thousand powers as wives. And all the five elements, their powers as His queens. Though Shri Krishna is a great incarnation, no doubt, but without Shakti, He could not do anything. One must understand the value of this work of Shri Krishna that comes from the Shakti. And even when we have to call His name, we do not say Krishna Radha. We say Radha Krishna, Sita Rama. Their names are taken first. Because without Them, They don’t exist. But that is “Adthya Druth.” That is in the underground. Sanskrit word Adthya. It is beautiful word, you see, but now in English, I don’t know what you say. Underground. Is there better word for that, something poetic? (Some yogi is saying: undercurrent). Undercurrent, that is the undercurrent. They are the undercurrent. Very powerful. And this is what is simple to understand if you really want to save this country. And for children, I feel they should get all the security from the mother, not the spoiling, but the security, the correction. My mother used to say that mother is the enemy of the child because she is the one who corrects the children. If father corrects them, children sort of do not like the father. But if mother corrects, it’s alright. Even you have seen, Shri Krishna was corrected by his mother. I had this beautiful story about how she corrected Him. You have heard about it, that once He ate some butter with other boys. She came to Him. He said, what do you mean by eating these butter? He said, I have never ate anything, then how do I found all these here? He said, these boys are putting on me. I have never ate anything. She said, alright, open your mouth. When He opened the mouth, she saw the whole universe within Him. And she took Him to her heart. Even Shri Krishna had to do that. So that motherhood has to come within us. And that is how Sahaja Yoga, which has come to you through your Mother, will be respected. You must respect women as mothers, and mothers must respect them as mothers. Even a little child in India is called a mother if it’s a girl. They will call them by the name mother. So this feeling of motherhood is only possible when we expose our motherliness, and that men expect that motherliness in women. So today Shri Krishna’s land needs the mother. May God bless you.
