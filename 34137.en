Talk to Sahaja Yogis, 5th August 1992, Ashram in Niittykumpu, Espoo, Finland

Sahaja Yogi: Now, I should study French.

Shri Mataji: Now you talk like kids. [Shri Mataji laughs]

Hello, everyone!

Locating your presents, was the problem. Locating, locating we found.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: Sorry for late.

We are searching for your presents.

Go ahead [Shri Mataji says that to the Yogi].

Beautiful place they have.

...And he was telling Me that the [sauree? inaudible] language is very near Sanskrit.

Please be seated.

The sound was just like Indian sounds. I was surprised. Just like Indian. Some places it was, I feel that you don't know which word to combine [unsure] but the sound, isn't it? Absolutely. Sorry, we took so much time.

We were busy locating your presents.

Shri Mataji: They'll bring it.

Sahaja Yogini: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: You can go downstairs

Shri Mataji: Somebody should go, somebody who knows.

You should ask them.

[Cut in the video]

Because sometimes he's saying, you can learn German. What else?

Sahaja Yogi: French.

Shri Mataji: French.

Sahaja Yogi: Marastrian.

Shri Mataji: Marastrian. You'll all become linguists. And you know, if you know these languages, so many, you will become a translator and so highly paid job.

Hello [to a young girl], what happened to you yesterday to you? Come along. Now, will you eat something? Take this. I'll give you another one. Come along, just take it.

[Cut in the video]

She couldn't feel the vibrations. And she told Me that she had been a disciple of this a disciple of that. They have still their disciples such as Sai Baba.

Sahaja Yogi: No, no, Rajneesh.

Shri Mataji: Rajneesh!

Rajneesh was very popular here, was he?

Sahaja Yogi: I don't think very popular, not so. No.

Shri Mataji: Some people do.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Yesterday there was one, another fellow who asked Me.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. He had only read, he had only seen the book.

Shri Mataji: Rajneesh's style was like this: you get a book, then he will put his own ideas and [inaudible].

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Always like this he used to do. And that's how you see, he wrote lots of books. He knows that people read and they will read and like, they will get into their heads all these things. So that was his trick. And there was a regular, I mean, organization which was doing this. Just taping him and whatever he said, they just translated it and distributed it. Because he knew that people are very book-oriented. He was like Freud, you see, Freud. He was like, absolutely like Freud. But he knew that in India he could not be so open, like Freud, because they'll throw him out. So, he took a little camouflage, I would say. A little camouflage, hiding.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: And ultimately, it came out, the truth, when he had these foreign disciples he started talking about the free sex, mass sex which even Freud had not said, mass sex. And this mass sex business really exposed him.

There's an English man who went there and he made a hole in a window.

Sahaja Yogi: What?

Shri Mataji: A hole, hole in a window.

Sahaja Yogi: Ah, ah, in a window.

[Shri Mataji laughs.]

Shri Mataji: And he puts his camera through this, very, very sensitive camera. And he photographed all that mass business very clearly. So, then it was brought to London and shown on BBC: God [unsure] to run away. The name of the-

Sahaja Yogi: God [unsure] to run away.

Shri Mataji: Run away. Because he went away from there, India, to America. And some English Sahaja Yogis taped it, they taped it. That program, they taped it.

Sahaja Yogi: Some?

Shri Mataji: Some English Sahaja Yogis got it on the tape that day's program from the BBC. But then he bought it at the BBC at a very high price and said that you cannot show it publicly. But we have got it.

[Laughter.]

It is your duty to look after them.The programs should be such, that you should work them out, inside Helsinki, as well as you should go out into smaller cities.And one thing is very important, how you live with the group. It’s very important. You must get rid of your egos, first of all. And in Sahaja Yoga you should never say: “You are a bhoot”, or things like that. Or, “You are possessed.” Just talk on chakras. That this chakra is caught, that chakra is caught.Also you should cleanse yourself at home. And also in the collectivity. All the ladies, specially, must know everything about Sahaja Yoga. Men know everything, but women are the – they are more emotional. You must know each and everything, which chakra is where, on the feet where they are, on the body where they are, inside where they are, what are they, everything. So you could have a course like that.

You’ll have to be very gentle, compassionate, and not to say things that will hurt them. That will really make them feel that these are different people. Moreover, Sahaja Yogis should never contradict among themselves. But when it comes to argument, better not have it with others. But somebody is aggressive, then you all should join together. Do not support the other one, because he is negative.Support your leader, always. Support the leader. If I find anything wrong with the leader, I’ll remove him. But you don’t fight with your leader.Luckily, you have a very good leader, I would say. Any problems, anything, you can always write to me.And you should try to cure people, but don’t touch them, use the photograph.You can give balance, you can give to chakras bandhans, but don’t touch them. The most important thing is taking a bandhan. Very important.Before going out of the house, before sleeping, before addressing the people. Or treating someone: when you are treating somebody, take yourself a bandhan, give that person a bandhan, and then treat him. That will help you.Now for example, if her sisters are doing like that [the translator explains that they are going to a wrong guru] you take her name, and give her a bandhan. It will work out. You’ve got one sister only?Sahaja Yogi: Two sisters.Shri Mataji: Instead of arguing, let just to give bandhan.Now, there are some little presents I could manage to bring. It’s travelling of six countries all around and in Russia I found a suitcase and I‘ve been able to save some things.Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is all, all too much for anything.Shri Mataji: No, no, no. It’s is a just, I – just a small.

Shri Mataji [getting a present]: Thank you very much.Sahaja Yogi: And then, Shri Mataji, Thou said in Kundalini Puja, when we were giving that silver kumbha as the puja present, and there was a duck. Thou said that, “In Finland there are lot of ducks, and even the ducks could not have that much discrimination.”[Shri Mataji laughs].After this, we have got this much discrimination that we are willing to give Thou a swan. [Yogi gives a figurine of swan to Shri Mataji.] Here are You!Shri Mataji: You have swans.Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: You have had the maximum number of swans. So the “nishanga” [absence of attachment] should be much more like swans. Swans are more. As they say there is a couplet in Sanskrit. Beautiful!Beautiful! What a balance.What a balance.And the- there‘s a couplet, very beautiful: “Hamsah shwetah bakah.” In Sanskrit. “Hamsah shwetah bakah. Soje [?] dudh, hamsa baka hai.” The – what is that bird which, which stands on one foot?Sahaja Yogi: It’s “haikara”. [Finnish word for “stork”]Shri Mataji: So the stork is white and the swan is also white. What is the difference between these two?Hamsaha, Hamsa is swan. Hamsaha- and Hamsa chakra. Hamsa are swans. And bakaha are the stork. But I can’t remember the name. It’s another one. [“baka” means “crane” but also “stork”.]So they are all white. But what is the difference between the two? The difference is: “Nira kshira viveku.” [nira: water; kshira: milk; viveka: discrimination] If you put water and milk together, a swan will just take the milk. When the discretion between the water and the milk is to be done, then “Hamsaja hamsaja baka hap[?].” Then hamsa remains hamsa, “baka ri [?]”. When it is the discretion between water and milk.

That’s why it’s swan. Swan is in India respected very much. Because it is divine bird. It has discretion. It can separate the water from milk.And that’s why I told him that: “For swan’s discretion, you should look at Finland!”Sahaja Yogi: What did you say?Shri Mataji: You should look at Finland for divine discretion. It’s a Hamsa chakra here. It’s a Hamsa chakra.Sahaja Yogi: Finland?Shri Mataji: Aa! [meaning yes]Sahaja Yogi: What?Shri Mataji: It’s a Hamsa charka Finland.Sahaja Yogi: Finland?Sahaja Yogini: Finland.Shri Mataji: Aa!Sahaja Yogi: You know, I thought this is Agnya.Shri Mataji: Ha? No, no, no, no. Agnya is only in Russia and China.But it’s here Hamsa chakra.

[A Sahaja Yogini is bringing something to Shri Mataji]Shri Mataji: Marion, you got something for- oh...!

Very creative ...That's so well... See this one...Very creative you people are...

So he is a poet also .

You are from where ?

Sahaja Yogi: From Finland ...

But Why should Devi come to you and [unclear38:33 ]

The only trouble with the popstars are that what they sings no body hears.You shoud be more clear .

They won't ..You see mostly those people who like this kind of a thing are mostly  drug addicts. The sensible people would like something very clear.

You have written about green sari I am also wearing green sari ...See what a combination ! Can you read it out loudly ...

(Then the poem is read by sahaj yogi)

That is the power of your love ...

That creates all those coincidences !

I tell you  an instance recently  I told you about ...He is such a strong Sahaja yogi & a very controlled.He wass the physical teacher of all the piolets 42:53 then he dicovered that it is at  9:30. He rushed to the airport & sent me [unclear 43:17 ] So we reached the airport 15 minutes late And the lady at the ground she just started shouting at me...I mean it was too much ...  That's why i now realized that when people have to g to airport they become mad ...because any body can shout at you !....

That's why now I realised that when people have to go to the airport, they take the name of the airport they become mad because anybody can shout at you! If they want they should take away their plane. Who wants their plane. They can take away their plane. Why should they shout? This lady shouted and he felt very sad. Then we went and sat on the plane. And UNCLEAR saw him crying, tears in his eyes. He is a very strong person you see, so she told him,' no, don't feel bad,' that, 'it's alright, it's alright'. And more than fifty Sahajayogi were standing on the balcony watching us, and they felt a very big wind came from the plane and threw vibrations, and they felt so peaceful they closed their eyes. They never had such an experience before and in a second, the whole sky was covered with cloud. In a second. There was not a single cloud even like this. In a second. They were amazed how so many black clouds and then the engineer told us that  the plane has been out of order for the past half an hour and they cannot go. And when we went to the airport, at the airport they said all flights cancelled. Then he got after that woman. He said, 'we all should shout at you'.You have no business to UNCLEAR but it is Sahajayogi s they asked me, 'Mother what had happened'.I said, 'this is the power of Divine Love'.' Love for Being'.You do not know your powers. How tremendous it is and it had not rained in Prague all these months. They were waiting for the rain. And it rained and rained and rained. In English, we say it rained cats and dogs, like that and days together. So this is what it is.Try to understand your powers. Now, this green saree must-have. UNCLEAR (laughing)So thank you very much for everything. May God bless you.l was thinking you can keep the saree for UNCLEAR. Another one(laughing)I hope you like the small presents. There are some extra ones if you get some other people you can give them. For the little children also give them. Chocolate. What are these flowers, they are beautiful? These we do not get anywhere.

Sahaja yogi: I don't know. What is the name?

Shri Mataji: I have never seen one like this. They look something like we call Morning Glory which is blue in colour. Beautiful. It is nice. (They are seeing some things) You buy here? You have butter here? How much is butter here?

Sahaja yogi: Four or five pounds.

Shri Mataji: It is expensive here.

Sahaja yogi: Yes, because they exported here.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Otherwise, it is expensive. England is much cheaper.UNCLEAR Ah, must be that. Foreign exchange. Put it in a bottle and every morning one drop in the nose for Hamsa Chakra. The bottle should be held under a hot water tap and heat it a little. Olive oil is good for hair. For the hair.

(Talking to a Sahaja yogi.) For the hair because you are a cold person. Heat it up a little. For UNCLEAR it is coconut oil. This water is also good for the skin. Water for the skin is very good. We have other things what we call in India, we have prepared for allergies. They will be in Cabella. Also for pimples and UNCLEAR automatically but still if you need. What else do we need. For pains and all that? Do you buy anything? ' Moov' in India.UNCLEAR( laughing) for liver we have, comes from Russia. When you come to India we will organise this. Travelling like traders. (Sahajayogi talking,UNCLEAR) Indians are very nice. They are very kind. In India, foreigners are respected like God's. It is one of the cultures, that those who are coming from outside are Gods, so must look after them. Also, those who are your guests of course. It is a very different type of culture. Ladies would love to cook for you and serve you. You say I am willing to eat out. They get very angry. It is the culture.

Sahaja yogi: I saw and changed my view.

Shri Mataji: No people don't know about this.This time they are very excited about your coming. From Delhi, we are going to Haryana. Such an excitement. They want to take you to Agra to see Taj Mahal, to Jaipur, near Ahmedabad, Abu. Near Ahmedabad a beautiful temple in Abu.Marble.Near Ahmedabad beautiful temple.Such a marble work of say 12 feet height, vault,  20 cubic feet or maybe more and inside all carvings.Very beautiful. Taj Mahal, also we had lots of these precious stones, semi-precious stones taken away by the English. Once upon a time, it was a very rich country. Very rich. Mohammed Ghajini looted us. One part, Mohammed Ghajanabhi looted our country. Plundered and thousand camels caravan and it is in Iran now. It is called as the richest site in Teheran. All these things are kept in a place and are called the richest site in the world. Richest region of the world. I went there. The door itself is 6 feet thick and only six people can enter and two guards. There are no armed guards inside. Now you see the diamonds. It is 100 metres by 100metre big hall. Diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, pearls all kept in caskets like this just like UNCLEAR..all over. They also have our peacock which has got seven steps of gold. And whatever is remaining out of that, they have made the big dome of 20 metres  all gold and wherever they have snow peaks they are shown with diamonds, peaks covered with snow, shown with diamonds. Rubies for Mother earth and the green for forest, emeralds and two sapphire and also pearls. Such big, big pearls I have seen, all from India. So many big diamonds. One of them was taken by the English.One by the Germans. The big one is called UNCLEAR, cut half. Still, we have so many things. In Mysore you did not see, there is a big elephant of gold in Mysore. I don't think you saw that when you went to Mysore because you were late.UNCLEAR..he has got gold cutlery, crockery for 500 people and nobody steals. So much..and even the poor people have seen them. There is no competition in India. Now see, if I give a diamond to my servant she UNCLEAR...It is symbolic of different jobs, status. But they don't have competition, they don't have jealousies. This mangal sutra..my family. UNCLEAR Another family also. Another family of class, nobody feels competitive. That's how we manage.No competition, no class consciousness and everybody is respected according to age. Like we had servants in my family, who were serving the father of my husband. So we all had to touch his feet, my husband also had to touch his feet. Any elderly person comes in, they had to be given respect, older than you, you are not to answer back. It's like that. A son may be Prime Minister, he has to touch the feet of his father. When I went to see our President at UNCLEAR he sat on the ground, he won't sit on the chair because I am a Saint. Even the Governors or anyone, they will not sit at the same level. Even one Prime Minister I have to say sat, and my husband was working with the Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, he used to open the door of my car. He was sitting opposite. I suggested it's too hot. There was one Sardarji, he was Foreign Minister he asked him to sit. When Shastri Ji said.. UNCLEAR supposed to be Godly and they are so hot. So they have that sense you see. UNCLEAR..Even the customs in India, if you are wearing my batch they will never question. In Delhi, one lady was bringing some silver. That time it was not allowed to bring silver in a bag and one customs officer stopped her and asked to open the bag and my photograph was on the top. They all have respect. They all want to have Realisation'.They are very God-fearing people. Even the Muslims are very God-fearing in India. But we all see UNCLEAR materialism and we also fall in the trap. If Sahaja yoga doesn't establish Indians can go down. One has to be very careful. Very happy I could come and talk to you today. That is why I told you, don't have a morning flight, have .. because I wanted to meet you. May God bless you. For Diwali, all people can come and pay ... UNCLEAR.You can come by a boat. You can go to Russia and then take this Russian flight. I will ask him because they are coming by bus from Russia. Is it alright?

Sahaja yogi: But the border from Ukraine to Poland is a problem. They have their Mafia. They have people ..in the queue and then try to...150 dollars... border.

Shri Mataji; But if  you can go to Leningrad by boat and then take the bus. It is much better that way. And the train is also very cheap from there. There the train is very cheap. I think you can ask UNCLEAR. Russian visa you get here, alright. For that, there is a lot of time. He can arrange it UNCLEAR.you don't go directly, you go to Leningrad and also what is that called, Easy Air, is easier. Leningrad you can get a train, overnight train, it will take you right up to Moscow, even further up to the end of UNCLEAR. We can arrange it but your passport number and photograph must be sent. You have to pass one more country.UNCLEAR.

Czechoslovakia is alright. Yugoslavia. We will find out.

Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji there is a seminar.

(Some person has come with some health problems and Shri Mataji is curing her.)There is a cut. We call it fissure. Does she get constipated? Constipation issue?

Sahaja yogi: No, no constipation.

Shri Mataji: How can it be. You can reach your hand there? On the left side or right? Working on her. Put your left hand towards Me. Feel her chakras. There is pain now?. Press it.No pain. Put your right hand towards Me. Press it. Press it.

Sahaja yogi: Not much.

Shri Mataji: You are feeling the cool breeze in your hands now? Little lower this side. Are you feeling the cool breeze? With the candle, water, and move the hands towards me. Her cheeks have become red.Two, three days she should be alright. Keep on meditating.

Sahaja yogi: It is smelling.

Shri Mataji: It is not wine.

Sahaja yogi: No, it is Kataya. We call ourselves kataya which means we are like this tree. We bend but we do not break.

Shri Mataji: What is the bark...
