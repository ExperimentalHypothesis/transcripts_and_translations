Talk to Sahaja Yogis, 5th August 1992, Ashram in Niittykumpu, Espoo, Finland

Sahaja Yogi: Now, I should study French.

Shri Mataji: Now you talk like kids. [Shri Mataji laughs]

Hello, everyone!

Locating your presents, was the problem. Locating, locating we found.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: Sorry for late.

We are searching for your presents.

Go ahead [Shri Mataji says that to the Yogi].

Beautiful place they have.

...And he was telling Me that the [sauree? inaudible] language is very near Sanskrit.

Please be seated.

The sound was just like Indian sounds. I was surprised. Just like Indian. Some places it was, I feel that you don't know which word to combine [unsure] but the sound, isn't it? Absolutely. Sorry, we took so much time.

We were busy locating your presents.

Shri Mataji: They'll bring it.

Sahaja Yogini: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: You can go downstairs

Shri Mataji: Somebody should go, somebody who knows.

You should ask them.

Because sometimes he's saying, you can learn German. What else?

Sahaja Yogi: French.

Shri Mataji: French.

Sahaja Yogi: Marastrian.

Shri Mataji: Marastrian. You'll all become linguists. And you know, if you know these languages, so many, you will become a translator and so highly paid job.

Hello [to a young girl], what happened to you yesterday to you? Come along. Now, will you eat something? Take this. I'll give you another one. Come along, just take it.

[Cut in the video]

She couldn't feel the vibrations. And she told Me that she had been a disciple of this a disciple of that. They have still their disciples such as Sai Baba.

Sahaja Yogi: No, no, Rajneesh.

Shri Mataji: Rajneesh!

Rajneesh was very popular here, was he?

Sahaja Yogi: I don't think very popular, not so. No.

Shri Mataji: Some people do.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Yesterday there was one, another fellow who asked Me.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. He had only read, he had only seen the book.

Shri Mataji: Rajneesh's style was like this: you get a book, then he will put his own ideas and [inaudible].

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Always like this he used to do. And that's how you see, he wrote lots of books. He knows that people read and they will read and like, they will get into their heads all these things. So that was his trick. And there was a regular, I mean, organization which was doing this. Just taping him and whatever he said, they just translated it and distributed it. Because he knew that people are very book-oriented. He was like Freud, you see, Freud. He was like, absolutely like Freud. But he knew that in India he could not be so open, like Freud, because they'll throw him out. So, he took a little camouflage, I would say. A little camouflage, hiding.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: And ultimately, it came out, the truth, when he had these foreign disciples he started talking about the free sex, mass sex which even Freud had not said, mass sex. And this mass sex business really exposed him.

There's an English man who went there and he made a hole in a window.

Sahaja Yogi: What?

Shri Mataji: A hole, hole in a window.

Sahaja Yogi: Ah, ah, in a window.

[Shri Mataji laughs.]

Shri Mataji: And he puts his camera through this, very, very sensitive camera. And he photographed all that mass business very clearly. So, then it was brought to London and shown on BBC: God [unsure] to run away. The name of the-

Sahaja Yogi: God [unsure] to run away.

Shri Mataji: Run away. Because he went away from there, India, to America. And some English Sahaja Yogis taped it, they taped it. That program, they taped it.

Sahaja Yogi: Some?

Shri Mataji: Some English Sahaja Yogis got it on the tape that day's program from the BBC. But then he bought it at the BBC at a very high price and said that you cannot show it publicly. But we have got it.

[Laughter.]

It is your duty to look after them.The programs should be such, that you should work them out, inside Helsinki, as well as you should go out into smaller cities.And one thing is very important, how you live with the group. It’s very important. You must get rid of your egos, first of all. And in Sahaja Yoga you should never say: “You are a bhoot”, or things like that. Or, “You are possessed.” Just talk on chakras. That this chakra is caught, that chakra is caught.Also you should cleanse yourself at home. And also in the collectivity. All the ladies, specially, must know everything about Sahaja Yoga. Men know everything, but women are the – they are more emotional. You must know each and everything, which chakra is where, on the feet where they are, on the body where they are, inside where they are, what are they, everything. So you could have a course like that.

You’ll have to be very gentle, compassionate, and not to say things that will hurt them. That will really make them feel that these are different people. Moreover, Sahaja Yogis should never contradict among themselves. But when it comes to argument, better not have it with others. But somebody is aggressive, then you all should join together. Do not support the other one, because he is negative.Support your leader, always. Support the leader. If I find anything wrong with the leader, I’ll remove him. But you don’t fight with your leader.Luckily, you have a very good leader, I would say. Any problems, anything, you can always write to me.And you should try to cure people, but don’t touch them, use the photograph.You can give balance, you can give to chakras bandhans, but don’t touch them. The most important thing is taking a bandhan. Very important.Before going out of the house, before sleeping, before addressing the people. Or treating someone: when you are treating somebody, take yourself a bandhan, give that person a bandhan, and then treat him. That will help you.Now for example, if her sisters are doing like that [the translator explains that they are going to a wrong guru] you take her name, and give her a bandhan. It will work out. You’ve got one sister only?Sahaja Yogi: Two sisters.Shri Mataji: Instead of arguing, let just to give bandhan.Now, there are some little presents I could manage to bring. It’s travelling of six countries all around and in Russia I found a suitcase and I‘ve been able to save some things.Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is all, all too much for anything.Shri Mataji: No, no, no. It’s is a just, I – just a small.

Shri Mataji [getting a present]: Thank you very much.Sahaja Yogi: And then, Shri Mataji, Thou said in Kundalini Puja, when we were giving that silver kumbha as the puja present, and there was a duck. Thou said that, “In Finland there are lot of ducks, and even the ducks could not have that much discrimination.”[Shri Mataji laughs].After this, we have got this much discrimination that we are willing to give Thou a swan. [Yogi gives a figurine of swan to Shri Mataji.] Here are You!Shri Mataji: You have swans.Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: You have had the maximum number of swans. So the “nishanga” [absence of attachment] should be much more like swans. Swans are more. As they say there is a couplet in Sanskrit. Beautiful!Beautiful! What a balance.What a balance.And the- there‘s a couplet, very beautiful: “Hamsah shwetah bakah.” In Sanskrit. “Hamsah shwetah bakah. Soje [?] dudh, hamsa baka hai.” The – what is that bird which, which stands on one foot?Sahaja Yogi: It’s “haikara”. [Finnish word for “stork”]Shri Mataji: So the stork is white and the swan is also white. What is the difference between these two?Hamsaha, Hamsa is swan. Hamsaha- and Hamsa chakra. Hamsa are swans. And bakaha are the stork. But I can’t remember the name. It’s another one. [“baka” means “crane” but also “stork”.]So they are all white. But what is the difference between the two? The difference is: “Nira kshira viveku.” [nira: water; kshira: milk; viveka: discrimination] If you put water and milk together, a swan will just take the milk. When the discretion between the water and the milk is to be done, then “Hamsaja hamsaja baka hap[?].” Then hamsa remains hamsa, “baka ri [?]”. When it is the discretion between water and milk.

That’s why it’s swan. Swan is in India respected very much. Because it is divine bird. It has discretion. It can separate the water from milk.And that’s why I told him that: “For swan’s discretion, you should look at Finland!”Sahaja Yogi: What did you say?Shri Mataji: You should look at Finland for divine discretion. It’s a Hamsa chakra here. It’s a Hamsa chakra.Sahaja Yogi: Finland?Shri Mataji: Aa! [meaning yes]Sahaja Yogi: What?Shri Mataji: It’s a Hamsa charka Finland.Sahaja Yogi: Finland?Sahaja Yogini: Finland.Shri Mataji: Aa!Sahaja Yogi: You know, I thought this is Agnya.Shri Mataji: Ha? No, no, no, no. Agnya is only in Russia and China.But it’s here Hamsa chakra.

[A Sahaja Yogini is bringing something to Shri Mataji]Shri Mataji: Marion, you got something for- oh...!

Very creative ...That's so well... See this one...Very creative you people are...

So he is a poet also .

You are from where ?

Sahaja Yogi: From Finland ...

But Why should Devi come to you and [unclear38:33 ]

The only trouble with the popstars are that what they sings no body hears.You shoud be more clear .

They won't ..You see mostly those people who like this kind of a thing are mostly  drug addicts. The sensible people would like something very clear.

You have written about green sari I am also wearing green sari ...See what a combination ! Can you read it out loudly ...

(Then the poem is read by sahaj yogi)

That is the power of your love ...

That creates all those coincidences !

I tell you  an instance recently  I told you about ...He is such a strong Sahaja yogi & a very controlled.He wass the physical teacher of all the piolets 42:53 then he dicovered that it is at  9:30. He rushed to the airport & sent me [unclear 43:17 ] So we reached the airport 15 minutes late And the lady at the ground she just started shouting at me...I mean it was too much ...  That's why i now realized that when people have to g to airport they become mad ...because any body can shout at you !....
