Talk to Sahaja Yogis, 5th August 1992, Ashram in Niittykumpu, Espoo, Finland

Sahaja Yogi: Now I should study French.Shri Mataji: Now you talk like kids. [Shri Mataji laughs]Hello every one!For getting your presents was the problem.Sahaja Yogi: YesShri Mataji: For getting, luckily we found.Sorry for late.We are searching your presents.Go ahead [Shri Mataji says that to the Yogi].

Beautiful place they have.[Cut in the video]Sorry we took so much time. We’re busy locating your presents.[Cut in the video]

It is your duty to look after them.The programs should be such, that you should work them out, inside Helsinki, as well as you should go out into smaller cities.And one thing is very important, how you live with the group. It’s very important. You must get rid of your egos, first of all. And in Sahaja Yoga you should never say: “You are a bhoot”, or things like that. Or, “You are possessed.” Just talk on chakras. That this chakra is caught, that chakra is caught.Also you should cleanse yourself at home. And also in the collectivity. All the ladies, specially, must know everything about Sahaja Yoga. Men know everything, but women are the – they are more emotional. You must know each and everything, which chakra is where, on the feet where they are, on the body where they are, inside where they are, what are they, everything. So you could have a course like that.

You’ll have to be very gentle, compassionate, and not to say things that will hurt them. That will really make them feel that these are different people. Moreover, Sahaja Yogis should never contradict among themselves. But when it comes to argument, better not have it with others. But somebody is aggressive, then you all should join together. Do not support the other one, because he is negative.Support your leader, always. Support the leader. If I find anything wrong with the leader, I’ll remove him. But you don’t fight with your leader.Luckily, you have a very good leader, I would say. Any problems, anything, you can always write to me.And you should try to cure people, but don’t touch them, use the photograph.You can give balance, you can give to chakras bandhans, but don’t touch them. The most important thing is taking a bandhan. Very important.Before going out of the house, before sleeping, before addressing the people. Or treating someone: when you are treating somebody, take yourself a bandhan, give that person a bandhan, and then treat him. That will help you.Now for example, if her sisters are doing like that [the translator explains that they are going to a wrong guru] you take her name, and give her a bandhan. It will work out. You’ve got one sister only?Sahaja Yogi: Two sisters.Shri Mataji: Instead of arguing, let just to give bandhan.Now, there are some little presents I could manage to bring. It’s travelling of six countries all around and in Russia I found a suitcase and I‘ve been able to save some things.Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is all, all too much for anything.Shri Mataji: No, no, no. It’s is a just, I – just a small.

Shri Mataji [getting a present]: Thank you very much.Sahaja Yogi: And then, Shri Mataji, Thou said in Kundalini Puja, when we were giving that silver kumbha as the puja present, and there was a duck. Thou said that, “In Finland there are lot of ducks, and even the ducks could not have that much discrimination.”[Shri Mataji laughs].After this, we have got this much discrimination that we are willing to give Thou a swan. [Yogi gives a figurine of swan to Shri Mataji.] Here are You!Shri Mataji: You have swans.Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: You have had the maximum number of swans. So the “nishanga” [absence of attachment] should be much more like swans. Swans are more. As they say there is a couplet in Sanskrit. Beautiful!Beautiful! What a balance.What a balance.And the- there‘s a couplet, very beautiful: “Hamsah shwetah bakah.” In Sanskrit. “Hamsah shwetah bakah. Soje [?] dudh, hamsa baka hai.” The – what is that bird which, which stands on one foot?Sahaja Yogi: It’s “haikara”. [Finnish word for “stork”]Shri Mataji: So the stork is white and the swan is also white. What is the difference between these two?Hamsaha, Hamsa is swan. Hamsaha- and Hamsa chakra. Hamsa are swans. And bakaha are the stork. But I can’t remember the name. It’s another one. [“baka” means “crane” but also “stork”.]So they are all white. But what is the difference between the two? The difference is: “Nira kshira viveku.” [nira: water; kshira: milk; viveka: discrimination] If you put water and milk together, a swan will just take the milk. When the discretion between the water and the milk is to be done, then “Hamsaja hamsaja baka hap[?].” Then hamsa remains hamsa, “baka ri [?]”. When it is the discretion between water and milk.

That’s why it’s swan. Swan is in India respected very much. Because it is divine bird. It has discretion. It can separate the water from milk.And that’s why I told him that: “For swan’s discretion, you should look at Finland!”Sahaja Yogi: What did you say?Shri Mataji: You should look at Finland for divine discretion. It’s a Hamsa chakra here. It’s a Hamsa chakra.Sahaja Yogi: Finland?Shri Mataji: Aa! [meaning yes]Sahaja Yogi: What?Shri Mataji: It’s a Hamsa charka Finland.Sahaja Yogi: Finland?Sahaja Yogini: Finland.Shri Mataji: Aa!Sahaja Yogi: You know, I thought this is Agnya.Shri Mataji: Ha? No, no, no, no. Agnya is only in Russia and China.But it’s here Hamsa chakra.

[A Sahaja Yogini is bringing something to Shri Mataji]Shri Mataji: Marion, you got something for- oh...!
