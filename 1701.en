Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 25 September 1999.

Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Ganesha. 
You all know what a powerful deity He is. His power comes from his innocence. When we see small children we are automatically compelled towards them and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them. And very innocent they are, extremely innocent, and when we worship Shri Ganesha we have to know if we have been really innocent or not. These days people have become extremely cunning, and they don't mind any amount of cunning. They play all kinds of cunning games on others who are innocent and simple. They can justify themselves always that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times when everybody is so cunning. 
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side, which is very much punishable, in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems, which are physical, you can say. Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed. Also, they can have other troubles with their liver treatments and all that. All this comes up. Then to punish them a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in. At this time, when you have these problems, all such people, who suffer from the right side, should worship Shri Ganesha. 
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you. You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing extra work, I should say, than normal. But you think you are doing a very great job of God. As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent. One of the two things come up and he does not know where he is going. The only thing that keeps you in the middle, in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha's Puja, Shri Ganesha's worship by which you can always be in the center. All these diseases of the right side can be cured by Shri Ganesha's Puja.

Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha but there is a simple way to remember him and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him. That's the best way you can balance yourself. There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have. All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha. Though innocent, He is extremely clever and when he comes to your help you are amazed. How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles and all the worries from you. So this is the most important deity we have. Though its a very simple deity. This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated. It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think, because it has many waves, it has many compartments. We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating. So to study down these you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ, and Jesus was also a very innocent person. If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified, but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others. His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was, he never said who it was. If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty, is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality and wherever he saw anything wrong done he is to go all out to fight it. Same is Shri Ganesha.

Shri Ganesha's blessings are very important for all the people who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle or 'Sankata as they call it'. He is called as Sankata Vimochan, the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life. So many of you have experienced how he has helped you in different troubles and hurdles and also different type of very very difficult times. It is his style that he manages things so well because he is a Ganapati. Ganpati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas. As I have told you Ganas exist within us. Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies who report if there is any problem. They report to the brain that there is a problem and on the sternum bone is the residence or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga. So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble, sternum bone starts vibrating and these bodies which are Ganas get the information. Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology. Then these Ganas attack. They can target also. They know how to target the troubles and attack it, one may think that only the people who are suffering medically are helped by Ganas is not true. Also the people who are mentally upset, who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas. These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out. For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere. Now his parents start crying for Mother and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens, that they immediately rush to that place and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say. So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati's Ganas. They are also small like him and they are very active and very alert. They never sleep. Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go and attack the problem and find out solution for him. It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

I can give you so many examples that have happened like this. For example there was a boy who got drowned in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool. They were all jumping in the swimming pool, I didn't like the idea of swimming pool very much because there were children. So one boy fell down into that and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes. Nobody knew he was there. So then they tried to find out the body of the boy and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone? Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool. After that they got so frightened and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy. Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram, I didn't know even the address, but I asked to telephone to this number, on my own. I don't know anybody's numbers and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water and he will be saved. Nobody had told me anything. "Don't worry he will be perfectly alright." Then they brought out the boy and he was treated by the doctors also but also with vibrations and today that boy is perfectly alright, while the doctors had said he can never survive. If there is one chance of his surviving, he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time. This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America. So, like this, so many things happen and people tell me that Mother its your 'kripa', your blessings that this has happened.

In a way, it is very distantly, I should say, but because of Shri Ganesha. Now Shri Ganesha's another quality is that he is extremely obedient to Mother. He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one. To him his Mother is everything. So he can fight with his father, Shiva, he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience and absolutely quick 'Tatpar', just quickly understands what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out. His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like but His work is tremendous. Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem, they are extremely quick and they are very fast. 

The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste, who have chastity as the prime thing in their life. Chastity is very much worshipped by him. Its not only in women but also in men, he expects chastity to be present. After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people, you shouldn't have your eyes rolling around every where and sort of what you can call a very bad method of communicating with young women and young men and spoiling your chastity. Even your eyes should be cleaned, even your thoughts should be cleaned. For that you should introspect and see for yourself. what mistakes you have committed and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have. You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you. If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything. He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you, but that is a very important thing. Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity. We should be very chaste. So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity. But religions have become so useless now, have become without any basis, without any proper execution, of what is written for them. They do all kinds of things and they call themselves Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions. Actually the religions have failed completely and that's why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

Another thing about Shri Ganesh is that he is created out of the Mother earth. He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth. So if he doesn't like people of some country, who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism and where people are also having very bad morals. He creates problems for them. What happens that He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes. Earthquake takes place in places where there is no respect of chastity, also where there are fundamentalist and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic. This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother. So the Mother earth also understands. Now we have so many earthquakes, one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan, but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died. So he protects them. He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind, he tries to destroy them, and he has destroyed many like this even before. Also, the Mother earth's powers he has got, is that he is magnetic, he attracts people towards himself, people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily. So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds, also in many animals but specially in the birds. That's how they can follow direction where they have to go. They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia. How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place. It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say in the waters which are coming from some hills, so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how, they go back to their own place. So going back to the same place is only possible if there is a way of knowing the direction. But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction, also they are bound by their own qualities. For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog, and a lion will be a lion. But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them. So they could be anything, you can't say and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything. And once they become anything like that you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level when they are human beings. But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives. So they can go to any level, any place.

Another example, I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur. In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur, these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha. Before the statue they dance and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad, music from some very funny films or something. It's so bad that you just can't bear it. Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha. So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had and they were dancing before it. But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home, they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha. At that time the earth moved and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself. They all disappeared into earth. Apart from that there were many others also who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth. And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center and around the center there was a very beautiful land but he did :not touch that land. Around is about at least quite a long distance, a big gap came in and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center and nobody was harmed: They were all at home. They were all right. But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched and this is how they saved the Ashram and not a single Sahaja Yogi died. It is really very remarkable how the protection is given by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

So we must respect his Ganas, very important is to see that they are all around within us, they are acting within us. They see us what sort of person you are, and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha by your misbehavior they try to see that you again go back to normal. They give you a chance many a times. But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego, you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest, I should say, calamity for you people. So you must worship Shri Ganesha but I always say don't worship every Shri Ganesha which is being created by those, we can say, artisans. Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are. For money's sake they might be making Ganesha and they might not have got any idea of Chastity. Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas, so we are not at all helped by this.

That's why Mohammad Saheb has said, don't do any worship of any idol because these idols have been created by human beings who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus. They are not created by the mother earth but are copied by people who are just wanting to make money out of them. So that's, how any idol you get, say, from the shops need not be worshiped, it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever. So whatever is not there, we should not worship because it is made by somebody who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat, who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself. With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha it is going to harm you, is not going to help you. You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship. There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth. I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris, the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people. I went to one of them and he said, "I am getting Asthama", "I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha, my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha and how he is doing this to us." I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead, what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha's Pujari? And then he realized it. I said, "I will cure you now. Its all right but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality. Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another and being very cunning and clever. Shri Ganesha's troubles, are really, I can't count them even, how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble, how much it can take you nearer to your death. He is so powerful, because all his energy is for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

He doesn't do anything, he doesn't want anything. Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple, what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing they make out of coconut. That's what he eats. His body is so subtle and so, so powerful that he can move mountains after mountains. With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence he can really change people. People who are very harsh, can be changed. His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika, of the right direction. But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy. When It was used by Hitler in the beginning, it was the right type and he was successful. But then what happened, they had stencils and they started using it from the other side. So it was from the left side, they started other way round and then they were all destroyed. How powerful is Shri Ganesha's Swastika, you can say. Also we have proved now that Swastika if you see from left to the right, is actually from the Carbon atom. The carbon atom has got Swastika and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms, all put in series. Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now, look at it from the left side to right side, what you see is Omkar. If you see it from right side to left side, you see the Swastika, and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross. So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world, is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it, is all clearly written about him how he became an egg and out of the half of the egg became Christ and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

All these things are there but we cannot understand it because we are confused. We don't want to see it in a proper sense that this is already written there. So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha. They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other. All the things I have told you about Christ, you can try to find out and you will prove it. Like Christ had these two fingers, this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna and this one is Vishnu's means this is his father's. That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna. Very clearly he used to do, why didn't he use other fingers, only these two fingers why did he use. Pointing out towards his father who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

It is easy to understand what I am saying, if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha. If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed, that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless, because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya. So it all opens out and all the stupid ideas about getting the Agnya, this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself, just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya. The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished. You are no more cunning. When you see this innocence on your forehead, you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear. You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others. You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out. This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing. When you sit on the ground also it helps more because the mother of Shri Ganesha is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth and that's why we should look after the mother earth. We don't look after the mother earth. We don't understand the value of mother earth. Actually in Indian culture it is that when you are getting up in the morning, you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth because I am touching you with my feet. Such respect you should have for Mother earth, then you won't exploit it, you won't have today's problems of pollution and this and that.

It all comes out of our ignorance that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha who's chakra we have got as Mooladhara. If you understand this you will be able to understand, what is to be done. The mother earth itself we should look after, we can glorify her, we can beautify her, we can do all kinds of things but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea, is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution. To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing that mother has produced and just to use it for money is a very wrong thing. One should think about it and when you cut one tree also you should put another one there. That is the beauty of the Mother earth, all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest. I don't know how they live but they do without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature. Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature, it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized that it should get the sunrays. There is no quarrel about it. They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed. The animals also don't destroy, at the most they might eat some grass or something, but normally animals do not destroy any tree, do not destroy anything as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use. Whatever may be the cry for this, we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha, who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi. He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time. He is the greatest yogi we have and the way he is doing right things all the time. He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible, I would say. He is the greatest deity we have and we should really worship him. Through him all deities are worshiped and are made happy and blissful. So this is today's thing was that I was just thinking that now a days, in modern times how we have become shameless, how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor. If we have any honor you will have the chastity but you are dishonoring yourself and you think you have been very very smart and modern by becoming so sinful. All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it. You should go no way near because that's all wrong and that's how Shri Ganesha gets angry. Decency is very important in understanding, what is our important basis, is our chastity. In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt for saving their chastity. I come from the same family and you can imagine what courage they must be having, what faith they must be having, in their chastity that if we lose our chastity what's the use of our life. So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have. Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men. Shri Ganesha is very important thing because men can develop so many diseases if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha because he is all the time repairing our body. He is all the time looking after, protecting us and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara. He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini, he is protecting our Kundalini. If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up but the one who supports her and, keeps her up, awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out. He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini which is also a basis of your self realization. So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know, and you should find out about yourself, introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha? If we are; what are we doing about it? Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things. You will not like them, will not like such people. That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out. The children are the best as we know. Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful. In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there. He is the one who is really innocent but extremely, protective of you, very much protective, with his innocence.

So we should also try to cherish our innocence and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated, dominated, every thing happens, doesn't matter. They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people. As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it, people are talking about it that there should not be domination of the innocent simple people. It has happened but it all has to be changed, has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist, like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people. In America, I was surprised to see that there were so many Red Indians, who are called as Indian Americans. They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away to different places and then I went to this place Canajohari. I found the vibrations were so good. That means they were very innocent, simple people and Americans that time, who went there, tried to completely finish them. So they went and hid in places like Canajohari but the Canajohari has such tremendous vibrations that I said look at this, so many years have passed, still the people who live there or worked about and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians, the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians. But they are so simple and innocent and they were so, I think, spiritual people because they used to worship the Mother. All the time they worship the Mother. Even I have seen in other countries it has happened but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular. They have many Maoris and all those people and they encourage all of them and its so surprising that they have so much talent and they are bringing them to this state to show that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia. Its a very good venture.

Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru, is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha. It has also a very big trunk, going down. Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha, from the mother earth. He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there. But there I felt really the source, source of vibrations. That's what it is. And in Australia I thank him that because of him only Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily, and Government also has never troubled us or there has been no problem with them. I don't know what's this helping them but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much. In the same way every where, wherever you may be Shri Ganesha should be worshipped and you will be helped out and out miraculously. You will be helped, miraculously but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

May God Bless You.
