Evening Program "William Blake Play", 
Eve of Guru puja, Cabella Ligure (Italy), 18/07/1992

[Starts at 45:48 after the William Blake Play performed by the Sahaja Yogis.]

These English young artists have really rendered it. It’s so remarkable, beautiful. 
My heart is really full of joy. All these things, if we can really somehow or other put into the heads of people who are lost, the ignorance in which they are just getting drowned, you just forgive them, forgive them, because they don’t know what they are doing now. But I’m sure what he has prophesized will come true, hundred per cent.
My God bless you, may God bless England.
[Applause]

It’s tremendous. 
We have had a very, very serious sort of a play [Shri Mataji laughs] and it’s good, because you see, hundred years back how could this great poet see the vision of today, you see? 
Not only that, he has described the house which will be built by the Golden Builders. 
The house was on Brompton Square, and he said it’s on a brook. So somehow we had to open it out and we went down, we found there was a brook there. It was built on the two shores, you can say, two – [Shri Mataji in Hindi:"kya kehetha hai" "how do we say?" About the shore of the brook] - on the two sides of the brook. 

And the whole span was covered with trusses so long as 80 feet, 90 feet [24 to 27 meters]. So you can imagine, there was a brook running down below. All the description of the house, everything, is absolutely correct. 
Then he has also described our first ashram, Chelsham Road, where he said will be shattered by a bomb – is a fact. There was. Everything that he’s described, I mean, he’s such a detailed visionary he was. 
Another is C.S. Lewis, is another great visionary who has described our procession in India, into such details that it’s impossible to believe. 
So not that they were only scholarly, but they really were visionaries, and it’s not just imagination but is the imagination which enters through the Divine power. And then it reaches to Reality, so clearly. 
I don’t know how much these people have worked hard for us, how much they have done for us. Even as we have Namadeva, who has sung that: “Oh Mother, give me my Yoga”, all of them have talked about this, sung about it. 
But somehow or other, in the Kali Yuga, people have gone into darkness, into ignorance. So forgive them. And I’m sure many will come out of it, I’m very sure, and their visions were absolutely correct and all those visions will be completely fulfilled.

May God bless you.
