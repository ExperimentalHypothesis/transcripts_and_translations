Talk to yogis "Learn from Your Guru". Ganapatipule (India), 6 January 1990.

I hope you all are meditating every morning and talking Sahaja Yoga, meeting each other, and this is more to get together that we should all discuss about Sahaja Yoga and find out what is the way we can do it better. Morning time I was thinking that we can allot it now to people who would like to have a sort of a, they call it a brain trust sort of a thing, a conference. You could have it. Of course, day after tomorrow we are all very free. I’m sorry, tomorrow is the Puja but day after tomorrow we are free in the morning time and also ninth we are free. So you all could discuss and talk about things and about what has happened in Satara district and all those things can be discussed among all of you and it can be established that we understand Sahaja Yoga properly among ourselves. 

Many people do not know much about Sahaja Yoga, especially ladies. I think they have to know quite a lot. They just think they are in Sahaja Yoga; so they are floating with the big flow of water. That’s not the way to know about Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga you must know precisely, must know what is, what is there, what is not there. So I would say that you could have a meeting tomorrow sometime or, I’m sorry, day after tomorrow, sometime and could discuss about what is it and how it helps you, what are the chakras are, any problems, anything. We have all kinds of people here. So it should not be just entertainment but it should be more sort of a morning session for learning things. 

We have, now tomorrow is a very important day for Puja. All of you are expected to come here for the Puja and I’m sure that it will help you all to achieve something in that Puja. As it is, you know that you have to go beyond your thoughts to absorb the vibrations. In your thoughts you get lost but once you are above the thoughts you get absorbed. Also most of the marriages have been fixed. But some people unnecessarily giving way to their conditionings or maybe unnecessary thinking and all that have tried to say “No” to certain people without any rhyme and reason, without any rhyme and reason. So it is nonsense. 

And such people I would say that should not apply anymore because we have wasted so much time. Of course, if they had some rhyme and reason one can understand but without rhyme and reason if you say, “We don’t want to marry,” that means it’s quite insulting to the other party. So if you have just said “No” because you feel from your heart and from your brain and from your these things, this is not the way to behave. And before saying “No” you should see Me and I would request you, all of you, to meet your fiancés and see for yourself. Even now there is time. But if there is no reason for saying “No”, if there is no understanding about any point, it is better to decide it now then [GW: than?] to decide it later. Now I’ve been telling you. Of course, you have all the freedom to do it. But for no rhyme and reason you have no business to insult other people. 

So I would request you that even if you have any objections, even now, please write it down and give it to Yogi Mahajan. He has really worked very hard and you know we have no choices. You see, it is very funny how so many marriages have come up. I didn’t expect even to fix ten marriages, because the age and the heights and everything was so much from one extreme to another extreme. 

Moreover, those ladies who have got children and all that, it’s rather difficult because we find people who are not very happy about the situation. So they should not feel bad about it. We hope to see people who would love to have children. All such people should come forward and they should marry women who have children and look after them. But it’s difficult. In the same way for men also, if they have some children or something there is a problem. But one should not feel bad about it. One should know that we are here for our Sahaja Yoga, for our ascent, and we have to rise higher. 

As it is, you know, one or two marriages do fail in Sahaja Yoga and they create lot of problems for Me. But is this the way are you helping Me? I am helping you in so many ways. Which is the way are you going to help Me is to understand that if we are married let us try to improve ourselves. Of course, I would say that certain problems come only from one side, not from both of sides, but whatever it is we have to understand that these marriages are not just for marriages but for something great, to create a new progeny of realized souls, to emancipate human beings. There are many saints who want to be born on this earth. So it is important that if you are married in that understanding then you will try to see to the good points of others and not the bad points, and should not see superficial things. If you are superficial it is better you don’t marry. But if you have any depth then you should understand you are marrying for something that is the concern of God’s work.

I hope by this you’ll be able to sort out many of your problems. And then some people when they get married they just get head along, absolutely get lost into it. This the another stupid conditioning of romanticism. You have married because you are in Sahaja Yoga, you want to help the Sahaj Yoga, you would like to have a companion who will be helpful in Sahaja Yoga. But they get so headlong into it that I’ve seen many characters have been ruined and people have been spoilt. But in a way it’s good because this is Last Judgment. If by marriage, by temptations, by wrong doings, by conditionings, if you have to go out, you have to go out. 

I must tell you that also there’s very little place in the kingdom of God. Unless and until you prove to be good Sahaja Yogis there is no place for you. For mediocres there is no place. You have to be serious, deep, seeking, dedicated Sahaja Yogis. Otherwise you have no place. If you are playing around only with your children, with your wife, then all right; go ahead. You have to get out of that and you must know that my first and foremost attention should be on Sahaja Yoga. That is so very important today. Formerly, that’s why people used to give sanyasa to their disciples. No marriage, no children, no household. Just be sanyasis. So complete dedication to the guru, complete dedication to the work. But in Sahaja Yoga it is not so. Because also I have given you realization so you can feel it within yourselves what is important. If something goes wrong with you then the vibrations also go down. 

Then also I have reports also, say, from many countries that people are very miserly. They do not donate for daily work. Of course, you don’t have to pay Me but you must know that without donation we cannot do anything, you cannot even buy a little thing like that, and from where it has to come? Of course, as far as possible I’ve tried to compensate but also you must know my husband is now retiring. So I hope the whole, with his retirement, the whole of Sahaja Yoga will not collapse. If you are such miserly people, only worried about your money, you want to extract each and every pie you spend, each and every little money you have given, then I must say such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga. Such calculating people nobody wants to shell out. I mean, I’ve seen people, even if they give a little bottle of, say, Limca to someone, they want to charge it. If you are that miserly there is no place for miserly people in the kingdom of God. You have to be generous, you have to look after people, you have to love each other, you have to give presents to others and you have to be very much giving. And in this I find that people will live in a good house, they will have a good family, they will spend on their children, for their holidays, for their education, for everything. But Sahaja Yoga, they become very miserly. So they are still so conditioned. So this is the Last Judgment. And you will be judged for everything that you do for Sahaja Yoga. Is one has to be very careful as to how you behave, what is your attitude is and how you should change. 

Your attention is also very important, if your attention is not there. I’ve seen some people still sitting outside, talking to people, doing this. In between the program they just get up and walk off. When there’s an, some, some artist is sitting you are not to go like that. It’s an insult to the artist. I, I just sit for hours together. And if I am supposed to be your Guru, you must learn at least that much from Me, how to respect and where to respect. So I have seen many people just getting up, walking, sleeping down, this, that. If you are that kind then you should sit on the corner and just disappear. Nobody should walk this way back and this [way]. It’s not proper. There should be, if you go to your church, do you do like that? Church which is based on falsehood? While this is the church of truth. And the way people take things without any discipline looks very funny. People start walking up and down, sitting the way they like. There’s no alertness about them. This is all. 

You must know when the music is on, I am trying to spread vibrations through that music. But some people are losing out. Some people are walking about. That is not a Sahaja Yogi. You have to be just spartan and smart. Like any if you see a saint, you see, if you see old saints would have their disciples used to be sitting straight before them for hours together. Of course, I don’t say that you should sit here hours together but if I am sitting here you have no business to behave like this dog that runs about without knowing what he’s doing. 

We are all human beings and there’s no, no reasoning behind it ? I don’t understand ? and there’s no explanation with it. It’s the behavior itself is wrong. Now anybody who has children and all that should sit on the other side. I would not like you to carry your children here and there when there is some program is going on. We have to show at least this much of discipline. 

So yesterday’s program was a little bit of farce, perhaps maybe because some people really behave in a manner that they should not have behaved. All such people who want to go like that should wait because in between the program we’ll give you some interval when you can go out. So let us have a society, a proper beautifully built-up collectivity which shows that we are very saintly people. We have poise, we have adjustments, we have understanding, we are doing everything in such a manner that it is all dignified. Now also some people have a bad habit of raising their Kundalini in the program, suddenly giving bandhans, giving bandhans to themselves, bandhans to others. It’s nonsense. Just now I am there. You don’t have to. Just you desire. You just try to develop your desire power and just desire. You desire something; it will work out. I mean, I work like that and you should learn this trick, how to desire. But desire should be pure desire. Then Kundalini works it out. 

I was in Kolapur and I was telling him, our Yogi Mahajan, I want to buy those chimtas for the, for the, you should say for all the countries, western countries and also the leaders. And just imagine, they said that you can’t get them in Kolapur. And there they are; they have bought it and brought it. I mean, it’s a small incident but there are thousand one I can tell you. I have to just desire. I desired that the Eastern bloc must be cleared out, must be freed. So a program of Sahaja Yoga, of what you call the Yoga seminar, was held in Russia. And I told My husband and I told everyone, “I’m going there to break the Eastern bloc.” I just told. 

When I went there they gave Me hardly any time. But I broke it because the people got realization. They were from all these countries and they just went and triggered it. So I told beforehand that this is My purpose but I am so intensely desiring anything; in the same way if you have a pure desire about it, not from any, any malicious or some sort of a selfish attitude. Like my brother, my sister, my ? this is Indians have this greater problem ? my wife, this, that. The wife will support the husband, the husband will support the wife, nonsensical things will go on. But by this they are really taking them down. And you people also should not sort of have because somebody it’s from, say, Switzerland, Swiss people will sit together. It’s a very wrong thing to do. I’ve told hundred times, nobody from the same…. 

Now I can see it’s even the same thing happening here. English must sit together. And English have the worst habit in this, that they must form a group. That’s their style, is to have their group. So this is all; it’s our conditioning. You see, why I am telling you that Sahaja Yoga is not going to benefit by you but you have to be benefited. So all these little, little conditionings that you have, you just judge yourself: “Are we doing like that?”; “Are we sitting?”; “Am I sitting next to a Swiss?”; “Am I sitting next to an Indian?”. Run away. And then maybe that you think you can speak in the same language or whatever it is. No. Let us sit, I mean. Then Delhi people will sit together, Bombay people will sit together and you ask them, “Do you know this lady?” ” No, who was she?” “I mean, she was there.” “No, I never met her.” Because nobody wants to meet, nobody wants to talk, nobody wants to know. 

And it is to be understood that this is a place of pilgrimage. There’s no fashion through all, and one should not go about putting fashionable clothes and fashionable dresses and... Be humble about it. This is sometimes I’m really shocked the way people are dressing up. It’s all right, for Pujas and all that, you can come. But the way people are dressed up sometimes it’s surprising. You are coming here, for what? For your meditation. So be in a simpler dress, in a simpler attitude, in a simpler mind. 

Today I have to tell you because I’ve been noticing few things that you are missing the point. We are here for our ascent. We have come all the way. Pilgrimage is there for your ascent and for nothing else. We are here only for our ascent, for our joy, for opening out ourselves. And that is what we have to remember. I’m your Mother. I have to tell you the truth because it is your benevolence that I want, that you all should become great foundations of Sahaja Yoga which is going to emancipate the whole world. 

Moreover, anybody who is sick need not come to Me. You can cure that person yourself. You can yourself cure. This person who is a realized soul can cure you, himself or herself, or you can cure. What is the need to bring everybody to Me? This is sick, that is sick, that is there. No need. Among yourselves only you can have these things done, and I think the doctors and all these people can also have a little conference together ,and anybody who has problems can come and tell them what’s the problem is. And can be done. There’s also no need also to have doctors. We have some people here; they are very simple people who can help you a lot. So among yourselves you should help and you should learn how to do it: how to raise the Kundalini; how to tie it up; how to clear the charkas; what’s wrong with you. Attention should be how I am going to achieve it. But the attention is not so high. So I would request you today that you please pay full attention to the program and enjoy and really try to develop that sensitivity of enjoyment. This is just you are clinging onto something which is not going to take you to the Ocean of Joy. All right? 

May God bless you.
