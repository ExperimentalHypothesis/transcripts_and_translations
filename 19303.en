Concert before Christmas, Ganapatipule (India), 24 December 1995

[The evening before the Christmas Puja a concert is held by Arun Apte and other musicians. After Shri Mataji’s arrival he starts singing but Shri Mataji stops him as Mr. Punjab – maybe some personality or authority – would like to offer Her a garland: “Mister Punjab...”.

Then the concert begins.

During the concert Shri Mataji comments: “Wah”.

At a certain point Shri Mataji interrupts the performance of the Marathi song “Gheyi Chand Makarand” which is being performed to explain its meaning]

[1.05.03] This song is describing a seeker like the beetle which is seeking the honey in the lotus.

Chanda means he’s got this fascination, wants to seek it. And he is not bothered.

In his own seeking he is moving, swachanda, in his own seeking, in his own fondness.

And he dhund means he’s just lost all other consciousness. Just seeking it.

Means you see, this is the beauty of Marathi, you can see the drama.

You stand in a drama, standing all the time.

This song is sung like many others.

We have a Marathi musical drama, always, which some of you are going to see on your way to it, Bombay.

Now this song is depicting a person who is a seeker. And he is not bothered about anything else. And then he says that he gets to the lotus and he goes to the lotus and just gets lost there.

And even when the leaves, or you can say the petals, the kamaladala, even if they are closed he is nicely lying down there just waiting to get the honey, the joy of the honey. And you see how is described, how he is absolutely lost into his seeking.

Then the beauty of this song is that it changes the raga. The first raga is, changes into another one, and gets into a very fast movement.

So it has a very, I should say, miraculous composition and I hope you’ll all enjoy this.

Thank you.

(Applause. The concert resumes. After the song the musicians go to bow to Shri Mataji and She applauds and says: “Wah wah”)
