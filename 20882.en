Conversation with French Yogis, Brompton Square, London, UK, June, 15th, 1982

Shri Mataji: To Me? What’s that? Alexandre: Some cherries. Shri Mataji: All right, thank you very much. Thank you, very kind of you. So, I’m very happy with the French for the way you people have done it. And I want you to be the same here now. Somehow, you’ll have to work it out and I don’t know how, how will you work it out. Sahaja Yogi: Somebody could stay here for a while and work it out. Shri Mataji: Yes. Alexandre: This is the wool you bought from Chelsea, Mother. Also, what happened is the French contribution, part of the French contribution, Robert gave Shri Mataji: Ah, this is the one, yes. Alexandre: Gave you a check note and he couldn’t put it in the bank. So, we went to the cash this time, of this money. For the Bombay ashram, Mother. Shri Mataji: It could not be cashed. Alexandre: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: What was [inaudible] with that? Genevieve or you will check which one was not cashed. Alexandre: French check Mother, from Robert in Paris. Shri Mataji: How much was it? Alexandre: Five thousand Francs. Sahaja Yogi: Five hundred pounds. Shri Mataji: Five hundred pounds. Is it returned? It was returned to him? Alexandre: No, he said that you have to- this check is blocked at his bank, you can’t. His bank will not pay it now, anyway. So, he asked me to give you back this. It is the cash of our contribution. He said that you just have to ask your bank to. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, you can’t have checks from a country to another country. You must have special checks. Shri Mataji: Ah. I’ll ask the bank.

Alexandre: Also, Djamel told me that he will have his registered marriage on the 9th of July and his church and family marriage on the 4th of August. Maybe the 9th of August. Shri Mataji: Church, he should not have. Alexandre: No. Shri Mataji: Dangerous. Alexandre: Dangerous thing. Shri Mataji: All of them who had in church are having a bad time in Sahaja Yoga. Registered is all right, we’ll have a Sahaja Yoga marriage, better tell them not to do. Alexandre: All right, Mother. Shri Mataji: If that helps them, it’s all right. But you see, what has happened of Arnaud’s marriage, you see? Not having any children, nothing. Alexandre: All right, Mother. Shri Mataji: I don’t know. They have to keep in bandhan. It’s all right, you see, for the family sake one should do, we should not try to displease the family. But church has no authority perhaps to marry. Alexandre: Yes. 

Shri Mataji: When did she come? Alexandre: She saw you two years ago in Lille Mother. Shri Mataji: I know her very well. She’s from Lebanon. Isn’t she? I remember her very well and you told Me she has gone away, you told Me she has gone to Dunkerque. Alexandre: [To Malika in French] You were in Dunkerque. Malika: Oui [yes]. [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: I was happy to see her yesterday again. You see, my memory is very strong. I saw her about two years back in Lille, you see. And then she went away to Dunkerque. I found out that she had gone to Dunkerque. Yesterday, I saw her I was very happy to see her. When Lebanon was attacked, I thought of her all the time. I said where is she now? And I was so happy to see her yesterday. I’ve not forgotten anyone of you, I cannot. You may forget Me I don’t forget you at all. Alexandre: It’s impossible to forget you at all. 

Sahaja Yogi: There’s only going to be another fifteen minutes.
Shri Mataji: For what? 
Sahaja Yogi: For that [inaudible] to be removed. 
Shri Mataji: No, but you tell them that you should not do it, you see, this is the -now, next time, if you do it, we’ll have to inform. Because such a heavy one, this thing, and on our [water pine?] why don’t they move it that side? You tell them to move it that side. Why don’t they put it here, on that lady’s house? 
Sahaja Yogi: That’s what I’ve told them. 
Shri Mataji: No, even for one minute you should say it’s really not allowed. What is it? Last time, we put a sheet there, everything, why should they do it all over the time for nothing? C.P. has told Me to tell them precisely because if it falls now, it is going to be too much for us, you see? And they are all going to come on us. 
Sahaja Yogi: It will cause a collapse. 
Shri Mataji: You tell them to get out. You see, once you ask them to get out, they will get out. You should say: "You are not to be there at all." I mean such a heavy thing, why should they bring it here? You’d better tell them they are aggressive people. Every time you tell them something, yesterday we wrote a sheet saying " you shouldn’t be there. You should remove it." Today again they brought it and put it down there. 
It’s too mild, I think, mild. They should not do like this they’re very aggressive. 

Did you tell them, Mike? 
Let’s see that they get out. You should say that: "Yesterday we have put the thing and they should not do like that." They won’t listen, you know, they are very, very obstinate. 

Shri Mataji: So, yesterday’s lecture was good. 
Alexandre: Oh, beautiful Mother. 
Shri Mataji: You liked it. 
Alexandre: Oh, yes. 
Shri Mataji: French are doing so well, Spain, Portugal; English, I don’t know what’s wrong with them. They just don’t move out, you see. There, only four or five people will get Realization, stick on to it, we are moving very slowly, it’s very, very difficult. Extremely slowly we are moving. Well, I just don’t know what to say to these people.

 [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

Alexandre: A French. Mother, maybe, will have one. 
Shri Mataji: I’m too much of a French. 
She’s so happy that Sahaja Yogis have come, you know that fraternity, that fraternity. 
Alexandre: For all of the countries. 
Shri Mataji: This Sahaja Yogini, she’s a great Sahaja Yogini. So, the fraternity acts. 
Alexandre: We may spend, Mother, I may spend maybe fifteen days or maybe a month in England this summer or I don’t know. 
Shri Mataji: I’ll talk to, just now, to Warren. 
These English, I tell you, I’ve trusted them even. I think because this is the heart, you see, they are attacked the most. And it is too much of a lethargy. Too much, I think they are attacked the most. That’s what it is. 
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

Sahaja Yogi: She says that she hasn’t meditated a lot these last times but -Shri Mataji: She’s all right still you can see on her face it has changed so must. Sahaja Yogi: And her sister got Realization. Zohra Shri Mataji: Hum! Sahaja Yogi: Zohra. She gave her Realization. Shri Mataji: She was a very positive person; I remember her remark which really made Me understand her. When I said that: "This is rather fanatics." And she said: But anything fanatic, how can it be good?" And I really won’t forget her remark it makes Me- for to say that for you to understand it in such a right way that anything fanatic is not good. How can that be right? She said it, tell her, I remember and we were eating our food together. We were sitting in a restaurant eating food then you said it, and that remark, that remark - Alexandre: [Translate into French] Shri Mataji: That remark, I liked it very much, to understand it so rightly that whatever is fanatic is not good, is not right. It’s simple! It’s simple as that, you see? But to understand that I have to go on this screwing into people. [Shri Mataji is laughing.] So, if someone understands it so easily something so simple and good. To be fanatic – like yesterday that Jew lady, she was saying: "Of course, Mother, I respect you and I accept you but can’t accept Christ." Imagine this fanaticism! 

Alexandre: We had a beautiful seminar with thirty people. Shri Mataji: Acha? Alexandre: She says her heart was opening during this seminar. We have felt that France started a new, something had stated by your blessings Mother at least. Shri Mataji: Sahasrara Day. Alexandre: Sahasrara Day, yes. Shri Mataji: Sahasrara Days, such things happen. It was great Sahasrara Day. Alexandre: The attention, maybe, of the universe started to get enlightened a little bit, more and more. Shri Mataji: Now, England is the place where I have to hit really. Yesterday was a good day. I work very hard, you know? To work on England, to see that people who are good people get a lot of vibrations, this thing, that thing. But the whole general setup of Sahaja Yoga in England is so funny, that only the whole thing comes up and suddenly they go down like that, you see, they are sucked into that. Even, I mean, they have got ashrams, they’ve got- see the ashrams in London, just see, free!

Alexandre: Beautiful place. Sahaja Yogi: Beautiful ashram. Shri Mataji: Can you imagine what- free, absolutely free, the money that is accumulated is just used for other purposes of Sahaja Yoga. Just imagine, absolutely free. Alexandre: She would like an ashram in the south of France. Shri Mataji: Ah! South of France is another Hell. I must say, south of France, I’ve been there. Where do you live in south of France? Sahaja Yogi: She knows people, she doesn’t live [there]. Malika: I know people. Shri Mataji: In what area. Sahaja Yogi: In the south. Where exactly?Malika: In Font Romeu in the Pyrenees. Shri Mataji: What about this place, Nice, I’ve been to? Sahaja Yogi: It’s the opposite. [It’s in the mountains.] Alexandre: There is one man who is still meditating, open your photograph, Mother, every day. And he’s called, his name – there is one fellow in Nice but he got, he’s the only one and he didn’t get so much- Malika: Much people in Nice. Shri Mataji: Is it? Alexandre: She says there are people who can buy a little village and live all together in the nature. But, it’s not really good to spread Sahaja Yoga because you are alone. Sahaja Yogi: I spent one year in Nice Mother, as a student, and I know very well the town. I would think, after this summer, I could go to another town. Shri Mataji: Nice? Nice, why not? It’s a nice place but I found people were very frivolous, tourists and all this nonsense is there just to [?] away their time, not seriously concerned with their own. 

Alexandre: There is some- there is. When I was there, I was starting seeking about God and I went to many places where people are seeking Mother. You know, in each town you have frivolous people and you have deep people. You have to find out the deep people, go to the places, inform them that there is, that you can get your Realization. 
Shri Mataji: That’s what one has to do. That’s what one has to do here also. Where is Warren gone? 
Sahaja Yogi: He is outside. Now, the captain truck is outside. [Unsure]
Shri Mataji: He’s talking to them. 
Sahaja Yogi: He’s coming. 

Alexandre: Do you know Salim? 
Shri Mataji: Yes. 
Alexandre: He requested me to say to you, he is studying actually, now, psychology. And he doesn’t know if it’s good for Sahaja Yoga and all that. And he would like to know what kind of job he can do that will be good for him to spread Sahaja Yoga. He doesn’t know if it’s good to go on with the university of psychology. 

Sahaja Yogi: Actually, he is at the end of his diploma, of his studies. He has already a "licence" (graduation) in psychology, Mother.

Sahaja Yogi: They are [inaudible] the lorry up. 
Shri Mataji: They are going out and she is not going to stay here. 
Sahaja Yogi: Pardon? 
Shri Mataji: They are going? 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes. They’re going now. 
Shri Mataji: Neighbours. 
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, lorries. 

Shri Mataji: Lorries. But who is moving here? 
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible].
Shri Mataji: So why should they keep the lorries on top of our house? 
Sahaja Yogi: I can’t understand why lorries can’t be part of [inaudible]. Apparently, police gave them permission, Mother. 
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: Apparently, police gave them permission. One of them got very aggressive, he said that, it’s much out of taste [unsure]. 
Shri Mataji: What happened? Permission? Police what? 
Another Sahaja Yogi: Permission from police.
Shri Mataji: They’ve got permission from police? 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, apparently, but.
Shri Mataji: What? Park it on top of this thing? 
Another Sahaja Yogi: That’s what he says, but anyway, he’s gone, [inaudible].
Shri Mataji: How can he? 
Another Sahaja Yogi: He was horrible. I mean they are horrible people, Mother. 
Sahaja Yogi: This is what is really out of taste [unsure]. 
Shri Mataji: How could they be there? They cannot be.
