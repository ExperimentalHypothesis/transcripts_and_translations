Conversation with French Yogis, Brompton Square, London, UK, June, 15th, 1982

Shri Mataji: To Me? What’s that? Alexandre: Some cherries. Shri Mataji: All right, thank you very much. Thank you, very kind of you. So, I’m very happy with the French for the way you people have done it. And I want you to be the same here now. Somehow, you’ll have to work it out and I don’t know how, how will you work it out. Sahaja Yogi: Somebody could stay here for a while and maybe work it out. Shri Mataji: Yes. Alexandre: This is the wool you bought from Chelsea, Mother. Also, what happened is the French contribution, part of the French contribution, Robert gave Shri Mataji: Ah, this is the one, yes. Alexandre: Gave you a check note and he couldn’t put it in the bank. So, we went to the cash this time, of this money. For the Bombay ashram, Mother. Shri Mataji: It could not be cashed. Alexandre: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: What was [inaudible] with that? Genevieve or you will check which one was not cashed. Alexandre: French check Mother, from Robert in Paris. Shri Mataji: How much was it? Alexandre: Five thousand Francs. Sahaja Yogi: Five hundred pounds. Shri Mataji: Five hundred pounds. Is it returned? It was returned to him? Alexandre: No, he said that you have to- this check is blocked at his bank, you can’t. His bank will not pay it now, anyway. So, he asked me to give you back this. It is the cash of our contribution. He said that you just have to ask your bank to. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, you can’t have checks from a country to another country. You must have special checks. Shri Mataji: Ah. I’ll ask the bank.

Alexandre: Also, Djamel told me that he will have his registered marriage on the 9th of July and his church [wrong information] and family marriage on the 4th of August. Maybe the 9th of August. Shri Mataji: Church, he should not have. Alexandre: No. Shri Mataji: Dangerous. Alexandre: Dangerous thing. Shri Mataji: All of them who had in church are having a bad time in Sahaja Yoga. Registered is all right, we’ll have a Sahaja Yoga marriage, better tell them not to do. Alexandre: All right, Mother. Shri Mataji: If that helps them, it’s all right. But you see, what has happened of Arnaud’s marriage, you see? Not having any children, nothing. Alexandre: All right, Mother. Shri Mataji: I don’t know. They have to keep in bandhan. It’s all right, you see, for the family sake one should do, we should not try to displease the family. But church has no authority perhaps to marry. Alexandre: Yes. 

Shri Mataji: When did she come? Alexandre: She saw you two years ago in Lille Mother. Shri Mataji: I know her very well. She’s from Lebanon. Isn’t she? I remember her very well and you told Me she has gone away, you told Me she has gone to Dunkerque. Alexandre: [To Malika in French] You were in Dunkerque. Malika: Oui [yes]. [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: I was happy to see her yesterday again. You see, my memory is very strong. I saw her about two years back in Lille, you see. And then she went away to Dunkerque. I found out that she had gone to Dunkerque. Yesterday, I saw her I was very happy to see her. When Lebanon was attacked, I thought of her all the time. I said where is she now? And I was so happy to see her yesterday. I’ve not forgotten anyone of you, I cannot. You may forget Me I don’t forget you at all. Alexandre: It’s impossible to forget you at all. 

Sahaja Yogi: There’s only going to be another fifteen minutes.
Shri Mataji: For what? 
Sahaja Yogi: For that [inaudible] to be removed. 
Shri Mataji: No, but you tell them that you should not do it, you see, this is the -now, next time, if you do it, we’ll have to inform. Because such a heavy one, this thing, and on our [water pine?] why don’t they move it that side? You tell them to move it that side. Why don’t they put it here, on that lady’s house? 
Sahaja Yogi: That’s what I’ve told them. 
Shri Mataji: No, even for one minute you should say it’s really not allowed. What is it? Last time, we put a sheet there, everything, why should they do it all over the time for nothing? C.P. has told Me to tell them precisely because if it falls now, it is going to be too much for us, you see? And they are all going to come on us. 
Sahaja Yogi: It will cause a collapse. 
Shri Mataji: You tell them to get out. You see, once you ask them to get out, they will get out. You should say: "You are not to be there at all." I mean such a heavy thing, why should they bring it here? You’d better tell them they are aggressive people. Every time you tell them something, yesterday we wrote a sheet saying " you shouldn’t be there. You should remove it." Today again they brought it and put it down there. 
It’s too mild, I think, mild. They should not do like this they’re very aggressive. 

Did you tell them, Mike? 
Let’s see that they get out. You should say that: "Yesterday we have put the thing and they should not do like that." They won’t listen, you know, they are very, very obstinate. 

Shri Mataji: So, yesterday’s lecture was good. Alexandre: Oh, beautiful Mother. Shri Mataji: You liked it. Alexandre: Oh, yes. Shri Mataji: French are doing so well, Spain, Portugal; English, I don’t know what’s wrong with them. They just don’t move out, you see. There, only four or five people will get Realization, stick on to it. Only like that, we are moving very slowly, it’s very, very difficult. Extremely slowly we are moving. Well, I just don’t know what to say to these people.

 [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

Alexandre: A French. Mother, maybe, will have one. 
Shri Mataji: I’m too much of a French. 
She’s so happy that Sahaja Yogis have come, you know that fraternity, that fraternity. 
Alexandre: For all of the countries. 
Shri Mataji: This Sahaja Yogini, she’s a great Sahaja Yogini. So, the fraternity acts. 
Alexandre: We may spend, Mother, I may spend maybe fifteen days or maybe a month in England this summer or I don’t know. 
Shri Mataji: I’ll talk to, just now, to Warren. 
These English, I tell you, I’ve trusted them even. I think because this is the heart, you see, they are attacked the most. And it is too much of a lethargy. Too much, I think they are attacked the most. That’s what it is. 
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

Sahaja Yogi: She says that she hasn’t meditated a lot these last times but -Shri Mataji: She’s all right still you can see on her face it has changed so must. Sahaja Yogi: And her sister got Realization. Zohra Shri Mataji: Hum! Sahaja Yogi: Zohra. She gave her Realization. Shri Mataji: She was a very positive person; I remember her remark which really made Me understand her. When I said that: "This is rather fanatics." And she said: But anything fanatic, how can it be good?" And I really won’t forget her remark it makes Me- for to say that for you to understand it in such a right way that anything fanatic is not good. How can that be right? She said it, tell her, I remember and we were eating our food together. We were sitting in a restaurant eating food then you said it, and that remark, that remark - Alexandre: [Translates into French] Shri Mataji: That remark, I liked it very much, to understand it so rightly that whatever is fanatic is not good, is not right. It’s simple! It’s simple as that, you see? But to understand that I have to go on this screwing into people. [Shri Mataji is laughing.] So, if someone understands it so easily something so simple and good. To be fanatic – like yesterday that Jew lady, she was saying: "Of course, Mother, I respect you and I accept you but can’t accept Christ." Imagine this fanaticism! 

Alexandre: We had a beautiful seminar with thirty people. Shri Mataji: Acha? Alexandre: She says her heart was opening during this seminar. We have felt that France started a new, something had stated by your blessings Mother at least. Shri Mataji: Sahasrara Day. Alexandre: Sahasrara Day, yes. Shri Mataji: Sahasrara Days, such things happen. It was great Sahasrara Day. Alexandre: The attention, maybe, of the universe started to get enlightened a little bit, more and more. Shri Mataji: Now, England is the place where I have to hit really. Yesterday was a good day. I work very hard, you know? To work on England, to see that people who are good people get a lot of vibrations, this thing, that thing. But the whole general setup of Sahaja Yoga in England is so funny, that only the whole thing comes up and suddenly they go down like that, you see, they are sucked into that. Even, I mean, they have got ashrams, they’ve got- see the ashrams in London, just see, free!

Alexandre: Beautiful place. Sahaja Yogi: Beautiful ashram. Shri Mataji: Can you imagine what- free, absolutely free, the money that is accumulated is just used for other purposes of Sahaja Yoga. Just imagine, absolutely free. Alexandre: She would like an ashram in the south of France. Shri Mataji: Ah! South of France is another Hell. I must say, south of France, I’ve been there. Where do you live in south of France? Sahaja Yogi: She knows people, she doesn’t live [there]. Malika: I know people. Shri Mataji: In what area. Sahaja Yogi: In the south. Where exactly?Malika: In Font Romeu in the Pyrenees. Shri Mataji: What about this place, Nice, I’ve been to? Sahaja Yogi: It’s the opposite. [It’s in the mountains.] Alexandre: There is one man who is still meditating, open your photograph, Mother, every day. And he’s called, his name – there is one fellow in Nice but he got, he’s the only one and he didn’t get so much- Malika: Much people in Nice. Shri Mataji: Is it? Alexandre: She says there are people who can buy a little village and live all together in the nature. But, it’s not really good to spread Sahaja Yoga because you are alone. Sahaja Yogi: I spent one year in Nice Mother, as a student, and I know very well the town. I would think, after this summer, I could go to another town. Shri Mataji: Nice? Nice, why not? It’s a nice place but I found people were very frivolous, tourists and all this nonsense is there just to [?] away their time, not seriously concerned with their own. 

Alexandre: There is some- there is. When I was there, I was starting seeking about God and I went to many places where people are seeking Mother. You know, in each town you have frivolous people and you have deep people. You have to find out the deep people, go to the places, inform them that there is, that you can get your Realization. 
Shri Mataji: That’s what one has to do. That’s what one has to do here also. Where is Warren gone? 
Sahaja Yogi: He is outside. Now, the captain truck is outside. [Unsure]
Shri Mataji: He’s talking to them. 
Sahaja Yogi: He’s coming. 

Alexandre: Do you know Salim? 
Shri Mataji: Yes. 
Alexandre: He requested me to say to you, he is studying actually, now, psychology. And he doesn’t know if it’s good for Sahaja Yoga and all that. And he would like to know what kind of job he can do that will be good for him to spread Sahaja Yoga. He doesn’t know if it’s good to go on with the university of psychology. 

Sahaja Yogi: Actually, he is at the end of his diploma, of his studies. He has already a "licence" (graduation) in psychology, Mother.

Sahaja Yogi: They are [inaudible] the lorry up. 
Shri Mataji: They are going out and she is not going to stay here. 
Sahaja Yogi: Pardon? 
Shri Mataji: They are going? 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes. They’re going now. 
Shri Mataji: Neighbours. 
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, lorries. 

Shri Mataji: Lorries. But who is moving here? Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]. Shri Mataji: So why should they keep the lorries on top of our house? Sahaja Yogi: I can’t understand why lorries can’t be part of [inaudible]. Apparently, police gave them permission, Mother. Shri Mataji: Hum? Sahaja Yogi: Apparently, police gave them permission. One of them got very aggressive, he said that, it’s much out of taste [unsure]. Shri Mataji: What happened? Permission? Police what? Another Sahaja Yogi: Permission from police. Shri Mataji: They’ve got permission from police? Sahaja Yogi: Yes, apparently, but. Shri Mataji: What? Park it on top of this thing? Another Sahaja Yogi: That’s what he says, but anyway, he’s gone, [inaudible]. Shri Mataji: How can he? Another Sahaja Yogi: He was horrible. I mean they are horrible people, Mother. Sahaja Yogi: This is what is really out of taste [unsure]. Shri Mataji: How could they be there? They cannot be. How can the police-we should really inform the traffic people once for all. [Children are running and laughing with very sweet voices.]

Shri Mataji: Like birds. 
Alexandre: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: It should be. 

So, we are now thinking these people are thinking of organizing something in London. Let them do it the way they did it in France. Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: And you are here, I think if they can stay here for a month or so, they can go round. They should find out people who are seekers, go and talk to them, tell them about it and worked it out. Yesterday all of them came because of my very great efforts I must say, my vibrations and all that. And I knew that I had to declare. Yesterday was a great day. Sahaja Yogi: Tremendous, Mother! Another Sahaja Yogi: A turning point, Mother. A turning point, in May. It’s tremendous. Shri Mataji: And I had to say it. Yesterday was a great day and that’s the day where they had gone also in Falkland and all that, you see, it's so very different. People were very jubilant. But this lethargy of this country is such an inertia that even those who were Realized, you see, because of the Sahaja Yogis, remain- they are sucked into that kind of an inertia. So, we have to build up also ashram I think, properly also. And you people have to go out, you see, to meet different goals. First of all, I’ve told them many a time. How is Gavin now? Sahaja Yogi: He’s good Mother but he constantly gets caught up from Jane, she’s – every time he is with her, he goes down very quickly. Did you have a chance to talk to her last night, Mother? Shri Mataji: No, I could not but I can talk to her. Sahaja Yogi: I think he was happy at your decision that you suggested him yesterday. Shri Mataji: Yes. Sahaja Yogi: And he’d like to see it executed. Shri Mataji: All right, I can phone her. Sahaja Yogi: That’s my feeling and- Shri Mataji: She could come and see me tomorrow morning. I’ll tell her about it. Sahaja Yogi: I think he would feel free to do his job properly then we can really start with the punch. Because, not only that Mother, but she goes home each day from the ashram anyway, so she’s not really living in the ashram. Shri Mataji: She goes? Sahaja Yogi: Back to the- back to North Gallantry [unsure]. Shri Mataji: I don’t understand. She goes back? Sahaja Yogi: You know how we- she’s coming to live in the ashram. But in fact she takes the baby and they go back to Shri Mataji: Is it? Sahaja Yogi: During the day and that’s what she did yesterday. And I think she was doing the same today. So really, I mean, it’s Shri Mataji: She’s in for it. Sahaja Yogi: She can rationalize Mother by saying that she has work to do, you know? Shri Mataji: But what Gavin is saying? Is she working with [inaudible]? Sahaja Yogi: That I don’t know but she appears to be making decisions. When I was there yesterday, she was telling people to do this, do that, do the other thing in the business. Shri Mataji: So, for one month she should take a leave from her work. Sahaja Yogi: I think this is good. Shri Mataji: And leave the child and Gavin behind. Sahaja Yogi: Yes. It’s a good idea. And I think Gavin was pleased with that suggestion Mother. I felt it, I felt it yesterday. 

Alexandre: Mother, also in Paris, I went to see my mother and now she is ready to sell few valuable things so we can buy a shop. 
Shri Mataji: Really?
Alexandre: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: What things she has got. 
Alexandre: She has very, very expensive furniture she bought when my father had a nice business. And she – it really worked out beautifully. [Unsure] I must say. I have now a very good rapport with her. 

Shri Mataji: Acha?
Alexandre: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: She wants to sell her furniture, furniture
Alexandre: Yes, she wants to so that I can buy a shop and also for six months, she gives me the key of her apartment because she is getting confident with me now. It’s very great, Mother!

Shri Mataji: You just see, the things you are sending to ... 
Sahaja Yogi: 41 they say and maybe one pottery. Is this a pottery from India? 
Shri Mataji: You see this one, like this.
Yes, what is it? It’s working out?

Sahaja Yogi: Gavin rang up, Mother, and said he’s been seeing the people about Portuguese and he said that they should go themselves to the customs. Shri Mataji: Hum? Sahaja Yogi: The Portuguese themselves should go to the customs. Another Sahaja Yogi: I can explain. Yesterday, when we went back again after seeing you, they really tried hard but they were unable to help us, in the sense that they could not even stamped it or anything but his honest suggestion was that these boys should go to the custom’s officer in Portugal and find out what is the best way of making sure that, what papers are needed or what’s this and what’s that and then, coming across the border, and going across and declaring it as their own works of art, works of art. And then it will not be dutiable. It is, because they had experience here from London’s artists who had come with their paintings and they wanted to know what to do. And from experience, they have found that if they take them back as works of art then they become their own personal property and there’s no question asked and no duty to be paid. But first, they urgently stressed that Elio and Riccardo should see the customs people in Lisbon and get the guiding of what to do on that score rather than from this end. Shri Mataji: So, why not give all to Riccardo? Sahaja Yogi: So that’s what Gavin is waiting for your approval to do. Shri Mataji: All right. Ask him to give to Riccardo that scene, that: "You go and see first of all the customs", all right? And tell them that this is what we have done. You see, this letter also let him read it out to them. Sahaja Yogi: He’s got that letter now. Shri Mataji: He’s got now. Now, from the letter they will know, you see, what is to be said. And you state this with the customs and – can you talk to them, Gavin? From here. Sahaja Yogi: I think- I think [Sahaja Yogis speak at the same time] Shri Mataji: You should tell him, explain to him and tell him that: "Do it". Because, you see, he would like to go by Friday, but you see, unless and until he finishes this kitchen, he won’t be able to leave, you tell him this. Now, CP is absolutely fed up, you know, and I don’t want to spoil relations with Laurent, because it’s already five months, you see, it’s too much. So, you tell him that: "You fix it up somehow and then you can go." Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: I mean, I can understand also CP, you see, so much time has passed and Laurent does not allow anybody to touch it, that’s the main point. So, that’s how it is, he has to fix it. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. 

 Shri Mataji: All right? Sahaja Yogi: Gavin knows the story completely, he doesn’t have to have me speak to him, he’s just waiting for Mother’s approval. Shri Mataji: All right, you just tell him, you just tell him that: "You talk to these people tell them what is to be done and confirm with them and ask them to see the customs and telephone us back. Sahaja Yogi: So, he said he was going to write to you, Mother, so he should bring them. Shri Mataji: Bring them? Because we have no time, you see, because Laurent wants to go now on Friday, he wants to leave on Friday. Sahaja Yogi: I’ll go with him. Sahaja Yogi: There is just one thing, just excuse me, just this before you go. Jean-Michel: No, no I don’t go. This fellow works for Air France. Shri Mataji: Is he? Sahaja Yogi: And he was suggesting just last night, that he might be able to get the whole consignment we’ve sent at a lower cost, direct to Portugal, Jean-Michel: Yes, but from Paris. Sahaja Yogi: From Paris. I’m just offering it as a thought Mother, I’m not saying we should change. Shri Mataji: I see. But it’s quite a lot. Jean-Michel: I mean, in boxes. Sahaja Yogi: Four trucks. Shri Mataji: It’s quite a lot. It will be too much. Sahaja Yogi: There is also the risk of damage too. Shri Mataji: Yes, better not. You see, this is easily set up. Laurent will go, doesn’t matter. So, he should leave on Friday. But you tell Laurent to fix it up, you see, fix it up. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. Another Sahaja Yogi: Well, he wants to come to the [indaudible] center to finish off with it. Shri Mataji: No, no, no. He should not come to the [inaudible] let him do it. Because now CP is also, you see, he’s a conditioned fellow. And these five months have passed he just can’t understand, you know. He’s telling Me that you are telling him other works, that‘s why he cannot do. So, tell him: "First, finish this." Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: And you say that: "I’m not going to touch it." Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: Laurent is a certificate eloquent. [Laughter] What he needs is to keep all his things; absolutely nobody can touch it, you see. He’s so, sort of a puritan about it. Nobody dares touch his things, nothing. Absolutely Sahaja Yogi: Locked! Shri Mataji: Absolutely locked and this and that he has suffered a lot because of that. My kitchen has also suffered. 

 [Laughter] And still the kitchen is not ready, can you imagine? And if he goes about like this anywhere else, I don’t know how he will do business.

Alexandre: Mother, there is an aspect that I feel we have never touched it in Sahaja Yoga. It’s all the cultural aspect of the- let’s say the pure countries. And I found it from going all around the places we have many associations or they gather people from other countries and they make some entertainment for others, a kind of cultural dances and singing here and there. And really, a lot of young people and really curious people are really attracted by them.

Shri Mataji: Now, they have a very great artist now in France, a very great dancer and he is very good and he is working there. And he is already going to Guru puja. Amarish, you see. Best is dance because it has music, everything in it and a story, you see? And he’ll do all the dedications, you see, like to the Goddess and all that. I’ve told him to prepare all that. And also, about Radha Krishna and all that, very nice dances. And if you can arrange his program something there.

Alexandre: Can arrange program of him? Will – is any- some Sahaja Yogis or some other artists would like to create classes? Because what I thought is to open a shop, people are just coming in, buying things and going outside. So, what do they get? Maybe some vibrations because we are there. But, first, if we can keep them for a little while, so I thought giving them tea, having a tea-shop or a little restaurant with simple food, Indian food if they wish. 
Shri Mataji: Plus that? 
Alexandre: Plus, some objects if there is pottery and plus also, all the cultural things. So, people will really be, you know, like. 
Shri Mataji: It’s a cultural union. 
Alexandre: Yes, cultural [inaudible] I was wishing of a cultural union. Let’s say that I really felt like doing such a thing. Like a-
Shri Mataji: Cultural. 
Alexandre: Cultural and also the commercial part would be good. So, we can get money and at the same time, can entertain people. And if we show them good things and maybe also, if we can propose to the children, because many children-
Shri Mataji: But you can get a hall in the city there? 
Alexandre: If the shop is big, we can have a hall in the shop. 
Shri Mataji: Really?
Alexandre: Yes. It could be.
Shri Mataji: In the basement, you can have a shop, a hall? 
Alexandre: Yes, whatever. Because what happens in France is, let’s say that one hundred square meters is not more expensive than three hundred square meters. 
Shri Mataji: Really?
Alexandre: No. At a certain level, this is not a problem of a- so you can go, we can get it in a not very crowded-
Shri Mataji: Locality. 
Alexandre: Locality, but still in Paris, and get a big thing and then work something big there.

Shri Mataji: That [inaudible] is a very good idea. 
Alexandre: And we can employ many Sahaja Yogis because you see, Benoît, for example, is working in a factory, he is tiring himself. I think he starts at seven in the morning and comes at nine and then go to sleep. It’s not much, he could do something else, Mother. 

Shri Mataji: So, you are working in Air France, is it? 
Jean-Michel: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Great. 
Sahaja Yogi: He’s on the ground staff. 
Shri Mataji: Ah, good. You see, for bringing this furniture from there, they are going to charge us three hundred and twenty-five pounds, only for bringing. Can you imagine? 
Jean-Michel: It’s very expensive.
Alexandre: Why? You’d better rent a truck yourself in Paris and bring it here? Imagine the money. We can take advise of that, we take a truck in Paris.
Shri Mataji: No, but they said you take two hundred pounds just to cross the Ferry.
Alexandre: Two hundred pounds? No, I’m sure it’s not true, it’s not possible Mother, because when we go with a car with five people in it, it will cost us about five hundred francs, so I don’t understand how-
Shri Mataji: Fifty, really? 
Alexandre: Yes, fifty pounds. So, you don’t need a big, huge. 
Sahaja Yogi: I’m sure you know how much is coming? You know much quantity? 
Alexandre: No, no. Do you bring a lot? Is it a lot? 
Shri Mataji: Not much, I should say. It is not so much as it could
Sahaja Yogi: You see, Mother has had advice from Patrick. 
Alexandre: Oh, I see, Patrick is-
Shri Mataji: He’ll do the best. You see, the thing is, I also felt it’s a little funny, but then I asked him, then he said two hundred pounds are only for the Ferry. 
Alexandre: Oh, I see. 
Shri Mataji: [Shri Mataji is laughing] Then I kept quiet. 
Alexandre: Oh, I see.
Shri Mataji: And I know Patrick won’t be this thing. But, you see, to plunge into it, I wanted to know why is it so much, it’s so [inaudible].
Alexandre: Maybe because he’s doing it as a commercial, under a commercial name. 
Sahaja Yogi: No, he’s doing it at the very cheap as he can. 
Shri Mataji: He himself is driving now, he says. 
Alexandre: Oh, he says. 
Shri Mataji: It’s most surprising because all the things that came from all the way from-
Sahaja Yogi: From Rome. 
Shri Mataji: From Rome, sixty-one pounds. But you see, if he does it commercially, it will be cheaper, why I am saying? It could be half. Because he has to bring the truck and take it back. 

Sahaja Yogi: It could be part of a table consignment. Yes, it could be cheaper if he did it as a commercially. Shri Mataji: Commercially, it would be half price. Sahaja Yogi: And he’s probably afraid of damaging something of Mother if he did it commercially. Shri Mataji: That’s possible. Commercially, it would be cheaper, it is one-sided, yes. Laurent? Laurent: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: We are trying to arrange your departure on Friday. The telephone will be available. But better finish your work. Sahaja Yogi: I’ll finish Mother. Shri Mataji: Otherwise, mister CP will never allow you to go. And he’ll be very angry with you. So, I must tell you very frankly, Sahaja Yogi: I know that, Mother. 

Shri Mataji: Hello? Come along!
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, how are you? 
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, some milk? 
Shri Mataji: No, a little bit maybe, yes.
Come along, how are you? 
Sahaja Yogi: I didn’t intend to intrude, I just bought-
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, there’s no intrusion. You can come.
Sahaja Yogi: I bought some ceramics. 

Shri Mataji: Hum? Sahaja Yogi: It’s all ceramics. Shri Mataji: I hope that you did not sacrifice. Sahaja Yogi: No sacrifice. Shri Mataji: No sacrifice at all we get anymore, because I got so much of ceramics now. [Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: You want another van, is that it? Shri Mataji: Please, be seated take a chair. Take a chair for him. Sahaja Yogi: Thank you. It’s a van you want. Shri Mataji: No, no. Romy [unsure] I told everyone that I may need your ceramics, but when I saw the ceramics that came out of the same lot, it was so much! Sahaja Yogi: Whas it really? Shri Mataji: That I may not be able to send all that I have already. I don’t know from where it is coming out, you see. So much of ceramics came out that [Laughter]. We have already filled in three boxes or four boxes maybe. Sahaja Yogi: You won’t send it in France. Shri Mataji: There are now two boxes and three big chests are already filled, there are still two or three boxes minimum.

Alexandre: Why can’t I give you back yesterday, also to take care. Shri Mataji: Ha? Alexandre: [Inaudible]. Shri Mataji: Busy, you can imagine! And we can give each to all of them whom I’ve not given so far. Sahaja Yogi [laughter] OK. [About a child] Shri Mataji: She gives so much with the heart. [Sahaja Yogis talking] Shri Mataji: You don’t give yours. Which one is yours? Let me see. They are very beautiful ones I must say. This is the one, the one - Sahaja Yogi: There was a cockcrow to wake us up in the morning. Shri Mataji: Aaah, that one. 

Shri Mataji: It’s a very good painting. Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: You see the colouring [or colour things], Indian colouring is so graceful! Sahaja Yogi: Very subtle, Mother. Shri Mataji : Very soft. You see, it melts into each other so beautifully [that one; unsure]. This is the beauty of Indian philographics. Sahaja Yogi: Here is one Mother. Shri Mataji: Now, help yourself. [Unsure] I’ve only this at all, I’m sorry. But we have so many already. [Noise of wrapping/ unwrapping in paper] 

 Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Yes, we have. Shri Mataji: It all comes out, I don’t know how. Now I don’t know, but this money, they have not yet returned it to Me. How much they have got already, how many they have returned already, we have to find out. Alexandre: I think, we have given one- ten thousand Francs from France. Shri Mataji: Hum? Alexandre: Ten thousand, and five thousand was in check. And these five thousands, I give it to You because the check was not able to be cashed in your bank. Shri Mataji : This is in pounds? Alexandre: No, in French Francs. French cash, French cash.

They’re quite agreeable to come across the border, and join the [inaudible] and proceed it through the customs
Sahaja Yogini: Fine.

Shri Mataji: Character is so beautifully done! It’s in action [unsure], is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Portuguese Indian, Mother. 
[Laughter].
Shri Mataji: Portuguese Indian [inaudible].
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible] As well, Mother, well I’ll show You. 

Shri Mataji: Even when I brought it, I had to put down the price, you know? Because they wouldn’t export it from India. They wouldn’t. They are also very funny things, you know. They said: “How much you paid for it?” So, they charged down. 
Oh! Look at that!

Shri Mataji: Some of them I bought in Madras and some of them in- I have lots of them with Me in India. But we forced [inaudible]
I had to put a price on that otherwise they would not. They said: "Give us the price". So, I had to get the price from somewhere, put the price there. I mean, you’re allowed to cheat in a way, you know. I didn’t know the prices as I bought some of them much earlier, somewhere, but it’s like that. But I had to put some price. They said: "Put a cheap price" because, accordingly, they did not value it much. It’s not a cheating but what I am saying is that in a way, it’s a cheating because in the sense that I took up a price on my own. 
Another Sahaja Yogi: Well, I mean you are always advised to put as a lower price as you can by the customs anywhere. This is it. 
Shri Mataji: But there was no custom to be paid, anything, it was all coming to Me here, you see. We don’t pay any customs anywhere but to leave India. Can you imagine? That thing has not yet left India, that [inaudible]. Why? Because the thing I bought from the gentleman [inaudible] worried. Now he is a blackmarketeer maybe, I don’t know. But why should I suffer? I don’t understand, he even didn’t give us a receipt. 
It’s a funny world, we have to change it. 
Alexandre: Yes, Mother. 
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, will You please accept that? 

Shri Mataji: By the way, did I catch your previous [inaudible]. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes. Shri Mataji: It was catch. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I went to Marseille. Shri Mataji: Marseille. [Private conversation about money]

Shri Mataji: Hu, hu. 
Alexandre: She- actually, what happened, she called us but seven times a week. But she didn’t succeed. She said: "I’m coming, I’m coming" and did not succeed to come. So, we are truing to go and meet her. But You could do a bandhan. 
Shri Mataji: She’s a little bhootish in this. 
Alexandre: Yes. 
Sahaja Yogi: Would you like a cup, Mother? 
Shri Mataji: No, but thank you. Let him have a cup. What about him? 
Alexandre: Oh, yes Mother. You know, the two black men we meet at the airport, the Congolese, they went back to the centre seven times before coming back to their country. Can you remember those two men? 
Sahaja Yogi: That’s great. 
Alexandre: At the airport of Paris.
Shri Mataji: It’s just, I don’t know what happened, they were so sensitive. They just followed Me. They asked us: "Who is this lady? What is this?" And all that. See the sensitive people
Alexandre: And they said they would prepare your coming there. And he said: "It’s not mood". He said: "Mother, I am very serious. You must tell me seriously, I am not just joking. I’m going to call You there." He’s in Congo or where? 
Alexandre: Congo, Mother. He wants You to come there. 
[Laughter]
Another Sahaja Yogi: You made a travel agent for the Sahaja Yogis. 

Shri Mataji: Now, this is for the building farm.

Foreign exchanges problems, they told Me about Geneviève. 
Another Sahaja Yogi: I am looking after that Mother. They refunded back to Switzerland- to France. 
Shri Mataji: She has to send cash. 
Another Sahaja Yogi: Yes, she has to send cash, that’s the main result. 
Shri Mataji: How can she send this cash, you see? 
Another Sahaja Yogi: That’s the problem. 
Shri Mataji: She has to send a money order. 
Another Sahaja Yogi: The bank is ringing; I’m speaking at the bank today just to finalize the matter. 
Shri Mataji: All right.
[Private conversation about money]
Sahaja Yogi: Is that your chandelier? 
Shri Mataji: They [inaudible] the chandelier for them to see. And you must also go and see upstairs, you see. You must call your friends to come and see the house. This was just a stardust [unsure]. See the [?]. This is nothing the [?] upstairs are even better. 
Another Sahaja Yogi: This room in the nigh time is just magical. 
Shri Mataji: This house was found by him. 
Another Sahaja Yogi: Really? 
Shri Mataji: Yes, but it was [inaudible]

So, this one, I’ll put it in West minister when I’ll go there Another Sahaja Yogi: That’s a separate issue. Shri Mataji: That’s a separate issue.
