Conversation with French Yogis, Brompton Square, London, UK, June, 15th, 1982

Shri Mataji: To Me? What’s that? Alexandre: Some cherries. Shri Mataji: All right, thank you very much. Thank you, very kind of you. So, I’m very happy with the French for the way you people have done it. And I want you to be the same here now. Somehow, you’ll have to work it out and I don’t know how, how will you work it out. Sahaja Yogi: Somebody could stay here for a while and work it out. Shri Mataji: Yes. Alexandre: This is the wool you bought from Chelsea, Mother. Also, what happened is the French contribution, part of the French contribution, Robert gave Shri Mataji: Ah, this is the one, yes. Alexandre: Gave you a check note and he couldn’t put it in the bank. So, we went to the cash this time, of this money. For the Bombay ashram, Mother. Shri Mataji: It could not be cashed. Alexandre: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: What was [inaudible] with that? Genevieve or you will check which one was not cashed. Alexandre: French check Mother, from Robert in Paris. Shri Mataji: How much was it? Alexandre: Five thousand Francs. Sahaja Yogi: Five hundred pounds. Shri Mataji: Five hundred pounds. Is it returned? It was returned to him? Alexandre: No, he said that you have to- this check is blocked at his bank, you can’t. His bank will not pay it now, anyway. So, he asked me to give you back this. It is the cash of our contribution. He said that you just have to ask your bank to. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, you can’t have checks from a country to another country. You must have special checks. Shri Mataji: Ah. I’ll ask the bank.

Alexandre: Also, Djamel told me that he will have his registered marriage on the 9th of July and his church [wrong information] and family marriage on the 4th of August. Maybe the 9th of August. Shri Mataji: Church, he should not have. Alexandre: No. Shri Mataji: Dangerous. Alexandre: Dangerous thing. Shri Mataji: All of them who had in church are having a bad time in Sahaja Yoga. Registered is all right, we’ll have a Sahaja Yoga marriage, better tell them not to do. Alexandre: All right, Mother. Shri Mataji: If that helps them, it’s all right. But you see, what has happened of Arnaud’s marriage, you see? Not having any children, nothing. Alexandre: All right, Mother. Shri Mataji: I don’t know. They have to keep in bandhan. It’s all right, you see, for the family sake one should do, we should not try to displease the family. But church has no authority perhaps to marry. Alexandre: Yes. 

Shri Mataji: When did she come? Alexandre: She saw you two years ago in Lille Mother. Shri Mataji: I know her very well. She’s from Lebanon. Isn’t she? I remember her very well and you told Me she has gone away, you told Me she has gone to Dunkerque. Alexandre: [To Malika in French] You were in Dunkerque. Malika: Oui [yes]. [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: I was happy to see her yesterday again. You see, my memory is very strong. I saw her about two years back in Lille, you see. And then she went away to Dunkerque. I found out that she had gone to Dunkerque. Yesterday, I saw her I was very happy to see her. When Lebanon was attacked, I thought of her all the time. I said where is she now? And I was so happy to see her yesterday. I’ve not forgotten anyone of you, I cannot. You may forget Me I don’t forget you at all. Alexandre: It’s impossible to forget you at all. 

Sahaja Yogi: There’s only going to be another fifteen minutes.
Shri Mataji: For what? 
Sahaja Yogi: For that [inaudible] to be removed. 
Shri Mataji: No, but you tell them that you should not do it, you see, this is the -now, next time, if you do it, we’ll have to inform. Because such a heavy one, this thing, and on our [water pine?] why don’t they move it that side? You tell them to move it that side. Why don’t they put it here, on that lady’s house? 
Sahaja Yogi: That’s what I’ve told them. 
Shri Mataji: No, even for one minute you should say it’s really not allowed. What is it? Last time, we put a sheet there, everything, why should they do it all over the time for nothing? C.P. has told Me to tell them precisely because if it falls now, it is going to be too much for us, you see? And they are all going to come on us. 
Sahaja Yogi: It will cause a collapse. 
Shri Mataji: You tell them to get out. You see, once you ask them to get out, they will get out. You should say: "You are not to be there at all." I mean such a heavy thing, why should they bring it here? You’d better tell them they are aggressive people. Every time you tell them something, yesterday we wrote a sheet saying " you shouldn’t be there. You should remove it." Today again they brought it and put it down there. 
It’s too mild, I think, mild. They should not do like this they’re very aggressive. 

Did you tell them, Mike? 
Let’s see that they get out. You should say that: "Yesterday we have put the thing and they should not do like that." They won’t listen, you know, they are very, very obstinate. 

Shri Mataji: So, yesterday’s lecture was good. 
Alexandre: Oh, beautiful Mother. 
Shri Mataji: You liked it. 
Alexandre: Oh, yes. 
Shri Mataji: French are doing so well, Spain, Portugal; English, I don’t know what’s wrong with them. They just don’t move out, you see. There, only four or five people will get Realization, stick on to it, we are moving very slowly, it’s very, very difficult. Extremely slowly we are moving. Well, I just don’t know what to say to these people.

 [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

Alexandre: A French. Mother, maybe, will have one. 
Shri Mataji: I’m too much of a French. 
She’s so happy that Sahaja Yogis have come, you know that fraternity, that fraternity. 
Alexandre: For all of the countries. 
Shri Mataji: This Sahaja Yogini, she’s a great Sahaja Yogini. So, the fraternity acts. 
Alexandre: We may spend, Mother, I may spend maybe fifteen days or maybe a month in England this summer or I don’t know. 
Shri Mataji: I’ll talk to, just now, to Warren. 
These English, I tell you, I’ve trusted them even. I think because this is the heart, you see, they are attacked the most. And it is too much of a lethargy. Too much, I think they are attacked the most. That’s what it is. 
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

Sahaja Yogi: She says that she hasn’t meditated a lot these last times but -Shri Mataji: She’s all right still you can see on her face it has changed so must. Sahaja Yogi: And her sister got Realization. Zohra Shri Mataji: Hum! Sahaja Yogi: Zohra. She gave her Realization. Shri Mataji: She was a very positive person; I remember her remark which really made Me understand her. When I said that: "This is rather fanatics." And she said: But anything fanatic, how can it be good?" And I really won’t forget her remark it makes Me- for to say that for you to understand it in such a right way that anything fanatic is not good. How can that be right? She said it, tell her, I remember and we were eating our food together. We were sitting in a restaurant eating food then you said it, and that remark, that remark - Alexandre: [Translates into French] Shri Mataji: That remark, I liked it very much, to understand it so rightly that whatever is fanatic is not good, is not right. It’s simple! It’s simple as that, you see? But to understand that I have to go on this screwing into people. [Shri Mataji is laughing.] So, if someone understands it so easily something so simple and good. To be fanatic – like yesterday that Jew lady, she was saying: "Of course, Mother, I respect you and I accept you but can’t accept Christ." Imagine this fanaticism! 

Alexandre: We had a beautiful seminar with thirty people. Shri Mataji: Acha? Alexandre: She says her heart was opening during this seminar. We have felt that France started a new, something had stated by your blessings Mother at least. Shri Mataji: Sahasrara Day. Alexandre: Sahasrara Day, yes. Shri Mataji: Sahasrara Days, such things happen. It was great Sahasrara Day. Alexandre: The attention, maybe, of the universe started to get enlightened a little bit, more and more. Shri Mataji: Now, England is the place where I have to hit really. Yesterday was a good day. I work very hard, you know? To work on England, to see that people who are good people get a lot of vibrations, this thing, that thing. But the whole general setup of Sahaja Yoga in England is so funny, that only the whole thing comes up and suddenly they go down like that, you see, they are sucked into that. Even, I mean, they have got ashrams, they’ve got- see the ashrams in London, just see, free!

Alexandre: Beautiful place. Sahaja Yogi: Beautiful ashram. Shri Mataji: Can you imagine what- free, absolutely free, the money that is accumulated is just used for other purposes of Sahaja Yoga. Just imagine, absolutely free. Alexandre: She would like an ashram in the south of France. Shri Mataji: Ah! South of France is another Hell. I must say, south of France, I’ve been there. Where do you live in south of France? Sahaja Yogi: She knows people, she doesn’t live [there]. Malika: I know people. Shri Mataji: In what area. Sahaja Yogi: In the south. Where exactly?Malika: In Font Romeu in the Pyrenees. Shri Mataji: What about this place, Nice, I’ve been to? Sahaja Yogi: It’s the opposite. [It’s in the mountains.] Alexandre: There is one man who is still meditating, open your photograph, Mother, every day. And he’s called, his name – there is one fellow in Nice but he got, he’s the only one and he didn’t get so much- Malika: Much people in Nice. Shri Mataji: Is it? Alexandre: She says there are people who can buy a little village and live all together in the nature. But, it’s not really good to spread Sahaja Yoga because you are alone. Sahaja Yogi: I spent one year in Nice Mother, as a student, and I know very well the town. I would think, after this summer, I could go to another town. Shri Mataji: Nice? Nice, why not? It’s a nice place but I found people were very frivolous, tourists and all this nonsense is there just to [?] away their time, not seriously concerned with their own. 

Alexandre: There is some- there is. When I was there, I was starting seeking about God and I went to many places where people are seeking Mother. You know, in each town you have frivolous people and you have deep people. You have to find out the deep people, go to the places, inform them that there is, that you can get your Realization. 
Shri Mataji: That’s what one has to do. That’s what one has to do here also. Where is Warren gone? 
Sahaja Yogi: He is outside. Now, the captain truck is outside. [Unsure]
Shri Mataji: He’s talking to them. 
Sahaja Yogi: He’s coming. 

Alexandre: Do you know Salim? 
Shri Mataji: Yes. 
Alexandre: He requested me to say to you, he is studying actually, now, psychology. And he doesn’t know if it’s good for Sahaja Yoga and all that. And he would like to know what kind of job he can do that will be good for him to spread Sahaja Yoga. He doesn’t know if it’s good to go on with the university of psychology. 

Sahaja Yogi: Actually, he is at the end of his diploma, of his studies. He has already a "licence" (graduation) in psychology, Mother.

Sahaja Yogi: They are [inaudible] the lorry up. 
Shri Mataji: They are going out and she is not going to stay here. 
Sahaja Yogi: Pardon? 
Shri Mataji: They are going? 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes. They’re going now. 
Shri Mataji: Neighbours. 
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, lorries. 

Shri Mataji: Lorries. But who is moving here? Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]. Shri Mataji: So why should they keep the lorries on top of our house? Sahaja Yogi: I can’t understand why lorries can’t be part of [inaudible]. Apparently, police gave them permission, Mother. Shri Mataji: Hum? Sahaja Yogi: Apparently, police gave them permission. One of them got very aggressive, he said that, it’s much out of taste [unsure]. Shri Mataji: What happened? Permission? Police what? Another Sahaja Yogi: Permission from police. Shri Mataji: They’ve got permission from police? Sahaja Yogi: Yes, apparently, but. Shri Mataji: What? Park it on top of this thing? Another Sahaja Yogi: That’s what he says, but anyway, he’s gone, [inaudible]. Shri Mataji: How can he? Another Sahaja Yogi: He was horrible. I mean they are horrible people, Mother. Sahaja Yogi: This is what is really out of taste [unsure]. Shri Mataji: How could they be there? They cannot be. How can the police-we should really inform the traffic people once for all. [Children are running and laughing with very sweet voices.]

Shri Mataji: Like birds. 
Alexandre: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: It should be. 

So, we are now thinking these people are thinking of organizing something in London. Let them do it the way they did it in France. Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: And you are here, I think if they can stay here for a month or so, they can go round. They should find out people who are seekers, go and talk to them, tell them about it and worked it out. Yesterday all of them came because of my very great efforts I must say, my vibrations and all that. And I knew that I had to declare. Yesterday was a great day. Sahaja Yogi: Tremendous. Another Sahaja Yogi: A turning point, Mother. A turning point, in May. It’s tremendous. Shri Mataji: And I had to say it. Yesterday was a great day and that’s the day where are gone also in [?] and all that, you see, so, very different. People were vey jubilant. But this lethargy of this country is such an inertia that even those who were Realized, you see, because of the Sahaja Yogis, remain- they are sucked into that kind of an inertia. So, we have to build up also ashram I think, properly. And you people have to go out, you see, to meet different goods [unsure]. First of all, I’ve told them many a time. How is Gavin now? Sahaja Yogi: He’s good Mother but he constantly gets caught up from Jane, she’s – every time he is with her, he goes down very quickly. Did you have a chance to talk to her last night, Mother? Shri Mataji: No, I could not but I can talk to her. Sahaja Yogi: I think he was happy at your decision that you suggested him yesterday. Shri Mataji: Yes. Sahaja Yogi: And he’d like to see it executed. Shri Mataji: All right, I can phone her. Sahaja Yogi: That’s my feeling and- Shri Mataji: She could come and see me tomorrow morning. I’ll tell her about it. Sahaja Yogi: I think he would feel free to do his job properly then we can really start with the punch. Because, not only that Mother, but she goes home each day from the ashram anyway, so she’s not really living in the ashram. Shri Mataji: She goes? Sahaja Yogi: Back to the- back to North Gallanstry [unsure]. Shri Mataji: I don’t understand. She goes back? Sahaja Yogi: You know how we- she’s coming to live in the ashram. But in fact she takes the baby and they go back to Shri Mataji: Is it? Sahaja Yogi: During the day and that’s what she did yesterday. And I think she was doing the same today. So really, I mean, it’s Shri Mataji: She’s in for it. Sahaja Yogi: She can rationalize Mother by saying that she has work to do, you know? Shri Mataji: But what Gavin is saying? Is she working with [inaudible]? Sahaja Yogi: That I don’t know but she appears to be making decisions. When I was there yesterday, she was telling people to do this, do that, do the other thing in the business. Shri Mataji: So, for one month she should take a leave from her work. Sahaja Yogi: I think this is good. Shri Mataji: And leave the child and Gavin behind. Sahaja Yogi: Yes. It’s a good idea. And I think Gavin was pleased with that suggestion Mother. I felt it, I felt it yesterday. 

Alexandre: Mother, also in Paris, I went to see my mother and now she is ready to sell few valuable things so we can buy a shop. 
Shri Mataji: Really?
Alexandre: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: What things she has got. 
Alexandre: She has very, very expensive furniture she bought when my father had a nice business. And she – it really worked out beautifully. [Unsure] I must say. I have now a very good rapport with her. 

Shri Mataji: Acha?
Alexandre: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: She wants to sell her furniture, furniture
Alexandre: Yes, she wants to so that I can buy a shop and also for six months, she gives me the key of her apartment because she is getting confident with me now. It’s very great, Mother!

Shri Mataji: You just see, the things you are sending to ... 
Sahaja Yogi: 41 they say and maybe one pottery. Is this a pottery from India? 
Shri Mataji: You see this one, like this.
Yes, what is it? It’s working out?

Sahaja Yogi: Gavin rang up, Mother, and said he’s been seeing the people about Portuguese and he said that they should go themselves to the customs. Shri Mataji: Hum? Sahaja Yogi: The Portuguese themselves should go to the customs. Another Sahaja Yogi: I can explain. Yesterday, when we went back again after seeing you, they really tried hard but they were unable to help us, in the sense that they could not even stamped it or anything but his honest suggestion was that these boys should go to the custom’s officer in Portugal and find out what is the best way of making sure that, what papers are needed or what’s this and what’s that and then, coming across the border, and going across and declaring it as their own works of art, works of art. And then it will not be dutiable. It is, because they had experience here from London’s artists who had come with their paintings and they wanted to know what to do. And from experience, they have found that if they take them back as works of art the, they become their own personal property and there’s no question asked and no duty to be paid. But first, they urgently stressed that Elio and Riccardo should see the customs people in Lisbon and get the guiding of what to do on that score rather than from this end [unsure]. Shri Mataji: So, why not give all to Riccardo? Sahaja Yogi: So that’s what Gavin is waiting for your approval to do. Shri Mataji: All right. Ask him to give to Riccardo that scene, that: "You go and see first of all the customs", all right? And tell them that this is what we have done. You see, this letter also let him read it out to them. Sahaja Yogi: He’s got that letter now. Shri Mataji: He’s got now. Now, from the letter they will know, you see, what is to be said. And you state this with the customs and – can you talk to Gavin? Sahaja Yogi: I think- [Sahaja Yogis speak at the same time] Shri Mataji: I’ll tell him that: "Do it". You see, he would like to go by Friday, but you see, unless and until he finishes this kitchen, he won’t be able to leave, you tell him this. Now, CP is absolutely fed up, you know, and I don’t want to spoil relations Laurent, because it’s already five months, you see, it’s too much. So, you tell him that: "You fix it up somehow and then you can go." Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: I mean, I can understand also CP, you see, so much time has passed and Laura does not allow anybody to touch it, that’s the main point. So, that’s how it is, he has to fix it. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: All right? Sahaja Yogi: Gavin knows the story completely, he doesn’t have to have me speak to him, he’s just waiting for Mother’s approval. Shri Mataji: All right, you just tell him, you just tell him that: "You talk to these people tell them what is to be done and confirm with them and ask them to see the customs and telephone us back. Sahaja Yogi: So, he said he was going to write to you, Mother, so he should bring them. Shri Mataji: Bring them? Because we have no time, you see, because Laurent wants to go now on Friday, he wants to leave on Friday. Sahaja Yogi: I’ll go with him. Sahaja Yogi: There is just one thing, just excuse me, just before you go. Jean-Michel: No, no I don’t go. This fellow works for Air France. Shri Mataji: Is he? Sahaja Yogi: And he was suggesting just last night, that he might be able to get the whole consign we’ve sent at a lower cost, direct to Portugal, Jean-Michel: Yes, but from Paris. Sahaja Yogi: From Paris. I’m just offering it as a thought Mother, I’m not saying we should change. Shri Mataji: I see. But it’s quite a lot. Jean-Michel: I mean, in boxes. Sahaja Yogi: Four trucks. Shri Mataji: It’s quite a lot. It will be too much. Sahaja Yogi: There is also the risk of damage too. Shri Mataji: Yes, better not. You see, this is [inaudible]. Laurent will go, doesn’t matter. So, he should leave on Friday. But you tell Laurent to fix it up, you see, fix it up. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Another Sahaja Yogi: He wants to come [inaudible].
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. He should not come to the [inaudible] let him do it. Because now CP is also [inaudible]. And five months have passed he just can’t understand, you know. He’s telling Me that you are telling Me: "Mother, we cannot do." So, tell him: "First, finish this." And you say: "I’m not going to touch it."
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Laurent is a [inaudible] eloquent. What he needs is to keep all his things absolutely; nobody can touch it, you see. He’s so, sort of a puritan about it, nobody can tough it, nobody dares touch his things, nothing. 
Sahaja Yogi: Under lock.
Shri Mataji: Absolutely locked and this and that he has suffered a lot because of that. My kitchen has also suffered. 
[Laughter]
And still the kitchen is not ready, can you imagine? And if he goes about like this anywhere else, I don’t know how he will do business.

Alexandre: Mother, there is an aspect that I feel we have never touched it in Sahaja Yoga. It’s all the cultural aspect of the- let’s say the pure countries. And I [inaudible] going all around the places we have many associations or they gather people from other countries and they make some entertainment for others, a kind of cultural dances and singing here and there. And really, a lot of young people and really curious people are really attracted by them.

Shri Mataji: Now, they have a very great artist now in France, a very great dancer and he is very good and he is working there. And he is already going to Guru puja. Amarish, you see. Best is dance because it has music, everything in it and a story, you see? And he’ll do all the dedications, you see, like to the Goddess and all that. I’ve told him to prepare all that. And also, about Radha Krishna and all that, very nice dances. And if you can arrange his program something there.
