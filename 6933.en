Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Kew Ashram, Melbourne (Australia)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) â€“ Draft
Shri Mataji: Better teach them how to manage this. But we have experienced now your wife should not be in charge. No woman should be in charge. If you want an assistance take another gentleman but not any woman whatsoever. While I think they don't understand. If they go in administration they go off their heads. So best is to have another assistant, if you want somebody, ask your leader here or someone and then arrange. Have somebody to assist you.

But, be careful, always be careful that he does not become dominant and does not try to spoil the scope. Take always all opportunities to create joyous moments. Like say this people have come, the young people have come married, should ask them to go out and have some nice time and give them some nice time, or something. All the joyous moments must be an advantage for the people to feel happier. You see this must be done.

And now, those who are married now also you must say that you are married, you see that you build up the atmosphere so that they feel the importance of marriage. I think that is not in the west but we have it. You all the times say the ripples which you see to please them, do this, do that, and then they see and then they build it up within their hearts, but that's not here, no interest. You show interest in their marriages, they are newly married, try to teach them a little bit here and there. And that's how you keep it up. See that has to be built up and those who come from India also newly married people, who have not been married before also you have to give them the joy, the happiness, and that also, all right?

For children, you should be careful, watch their vibrations, you must watch vibrations. Now know that your vibration, know everyone through vibrations and nothing else. You have to use your vibrations all the time. Because if you use your brains, you may go wrong. But use your vibrations and things will work out well. Any questions?

Sahaja Yogi: There is a little tendency, Mother, for them to forget about being spontaneous.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that's the point. You have to be very spontaneous. More spontaneous. You see, like I was telling you the planning side, now what - I go to the shop. First I go to the shop. Say I have to buy something for cooking. I see what is available - I buy all that. Bring it home and then cook. While you people decide beforehand what you are going to buy. What you are going to make. And when you go you don't find that. It's the other way around. Spontaneity is that what is available now, all right, what do we make out of it. You go to the shop, you see something nice which is artistic or something for the Ashram, you want to buy something like that to decorate this. Buy it. For anything, for presents, or anything, just buy it and keep it. It comes handy.

So whatever is presented to you is spontaneous not what is in your mind. This is the point you miss. Whatever is in your mind is not the one that is presented to you. Because nature is going to present you. isn't it? This Ritambhara PrAgnya is going to present you. Brahma-Shakti is going to present you. With things. But you will not avail of it because you have something in your own mind. So it will cross over. This is not what spontaneity is. Wait for that you should, something comes up all right. Let's do, let's have it. For anything. Supposing somebody is coming. Now think what things we should do to make them happy. Let's do something to make each one happy. Among also you, yourselves, you are all leaders now. Let's see when it is his birthday you should be sending some nice note, something nice for him to feel or some sort of a little present for him, "Oh, all right, I will give this one; will suit him very well." Little, little things, you see, make your life so beautiful.

In nature also you see little, little things, little projections that makes the variety. It's so beautiful. If they were all just the same as you thinking about them then it is [INAUDIBLE] (laugh.) It is spontaneous. Don't try to override the other way around, that's the trouble with the western mind. They always try to arrange the other way round. Whatever is there just make messed of it. And it will all present, the whole opportunity will come to you, of everything. Of Sahaja Yogis will be coming to you.

Now also you must judge the Sahaja Yogis by their vibration. Don't pay importance to people who try to be too much close to you. You must know that they must be suffering from something so they are going to be with you more. In a way they insist, are traveling to come and stay in the Ashram, this, that, just see vibrations. If vibrations they are all right, how they work out first see, how they work out, how far they can go, how much they recognize Me. If they recognize Me, well and good. Then get them. But see their vibrations and if they recognize Me, these two points you must see. If they do not recognize Me they you shouldn't have them. Don't have funny people here. Anything who is sick, anybody, should be out. Ashram is not the place for sick people. And don't allow them to come. Last night there was a mad woman coming to the Ashram. She should not be allowed. On the contrary take some other place center for your programs. So you have your Ashram separately senior from them. There you go and have the program, you come back.

Sahaja Yogi: For the major [INAUDIBLE] programs.

Shri Mataji: Only people whom you think are capable of recognizing Me only have Pujas with them. You need not have all of them. Puja also you must be discriminated. One should not be cruel about it, one should be sensible and tactful of handling people. Also sometimes you tell, "You are a bhoot and you get off (laugh...)" You see, that's something very important that's you should say that she is yet not for puja. If they are not coming for the inner circle.

For Pujas just have people who are recognizing Me, otherwise don't have them. Talk about Me, tell them who I am, that's what you think that's how. They might say you see, one of you should ask him to tell, you see there are ways around. Like one of the Ashrams I should ask a question, "Then if She is doing all these then who is She?" They will say, "No, that's true, She does it." Or somebody can say, "If Kundalini is so difficult how is She able to do that?", then you say, "Because She is this". You put somebody up there and ask a question, like you see it's a fraud, what you think (laugh). Then you answer that, "That's what we have found out." Then others will think he is one of us, you see. Ask some of them to ask questions that will relate to Me. That's important. Without recognition I cannot do it. Without their surrendering to Me that recognition, I cannot do. You know that.

And for you also it is important that you must surrender to Me fully recognizing Me as Mother. Read more about the Devi Mahatmyam, about the names, what does the name, the thousand names, what does that mean, what Devi is doing, what She has done before, try to understand. See some people have gone very far like Rushtam and these people, [INAUDIBLE] and these people. They read and understand. And try to read Sanskrit. Try to understand what it is. You have to, it's a knowledge.

Sahaja Yogi: And you'll have to conduct courses for these people to upgrade the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Ya, you must talk to them, ask them questions. Where do feel which Chakra, what do feel. Supposing if this is the sickness how will you cure, if that is the sickness, what will do. This sort of courses we should do.

Sahaja Yogi: I will try to write a book or do something on that.

Shri Mataji: Of course. First you should have a course for them. (laugh...)

Sahaja Yogi: [INAUDIBLE]

Shri Mataji: May God bless you, and thank you very much for everything for the nice presents for presenting all that is so beautiful Australia. May God bless you, I wish you all the best, all the best, from My heart.

Yogis: "Bolo Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi ki Jai"

Shri Mataji: Now this fellow you see, one who is standing here, he recognizes Me very well, so you will see always he will be saying mantras. Because he knows Mantras means that, you see, he is a very clever. He jumps at the right moments, know what it is, Pujas then he will act for Pujas, one Puja goes to Bombay, leaving Bombay, another Puja, poor Mother has to be there. But Pujas also if you do and if you do not raise above it and keep it up the Puja will again. Of course Puja does that.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, from all the leaders here and I know it's from all the Sahaja Yogis here, we want to thank [INAUDIBLE] for coming for a such sort time and do such beautiful job and doing [INAUDIBLE] such a beautiful brotherhood, we just said that he has been able to stay longer and we've just enjoyed your stay here. And please come back again.

Another Yogi: I am also thankful to you for whatever presents you have given to me. I don't know I haven't brought any presents for you.

Shri Mataji: You have given My father's photograph. You see My father's photograph which is a very satisfying thing for Me. It is very satisfying. Something great he has done, think of it. And I told him, My mother's photograph also I have which I can give you, which you can enlarge and can make it a good [INAUDIBLE]

Yogis: Thank you very much and see you again.

[Missing recording]

Since you gave them parties, dinners that's how you become permanent friends.

[Missing recording]

Shri Mataji: So the children are enjoying themselves in preparing the next occasion. Going to sit down and finalize the marriage program, all right. So I'm glad to have the names of the people who are getting married and I hope they have everything all right. They will have to check upon all these things, isn't it? Because the day after tomorrow there will be a Puja and then we will have to prepare for wedding day, that is Sunday. Puja will be in the evening?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, if you wish so, Mother.

Shri Mataji: But what we can do, if you want to have a sort of follow-up program, you can have it, in the morning time.

Sahaja Yogi: On Saturday morning? But Mother, it will be too much for you.

Shri Mataji: No, I will out only for one hour.

Sahaja Yogi: We can do it basically.

Shri Mataji: Yes, you see, because I think the contacts are lost. If you don't say I am not there, I am not there, they won't come. So best is to have one day. I will just come for an hour outside, that's all. You'll manage them.

Sahaja Yogi: And we don't cook for them anything, just let them come in the morning.

Shri Mataji: Yes. Last time did you cook?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, we did. But not this time, Mother.

Shri Mataji: So they should be left out, they should come here, at a time about say 10 o'clock and leave on about 12'o clock, so they don't need anything.

Sahaja Yogi: Saturday morning shopping, that's the only question, isn't it? Would it affect them or not? In Melbourne. Let's do it in Saturday morning anyway, let's try, let's give it a try. We have these ideas and maybe we are wrong.

Shri Mataji: That's why you are saying, you will have the - Monday when am I flying?

Sahaja Yogi: 2 o'clock

Shri Mataji: That's why you wanted to have the marriages first on Saturday? Was that the idea?

Sahaja Yogi: I didn't plan it that way.

Shri Mataji: Saturday the marriages and then Sunday morning these people coming over.

Sahaja Yogi: Workshop on Sunday morning and then Puja on Sunday night.

Shri Mataji: All right. Because on a wedding day, you see, if there are shopping people around then better to use them for wedding need, all right? So we can have the marriages on Saturday, but you need time, you see, to prepare. Today is what? Tomorrow is Friday.

Sahaja Yogi: We will bring up, [INAUDIBLE] let's try.

Shri Mataji: Saturday we can then keep the marriages. One advantage will be that the shops will be open. If we need anything we can get it on Saturday. All right, we will do that way.

Another Yogi: Mother what if we have the workshop in the backyard, in a large tent?

Sahaja Yogi: When, at what time?

Another Yogi: On Sunday morning.

Shri Mataji: Because I have the same tent.

Sahaja Yogi: There is the Puja. The tent is there now, it is sitting.

Shri Mataji: Now he is saying, Saturday evening Marriages, Sunday morning workshop, evening time Puja.

Sahaja Yogi: That was the original plan, isn't it?

Shri Mataji: I think what would be very better [INAUDIBLE] - it will be very hot in the morning time.

Sahaja Yogi: But the coolings are down there...

Mataji: Oh, ya.

Sahaja Yogi: We can lift the flaps of the tent up, Mother. We can lift the flaps of the side up.

Shri Mataji: Something has to be worked out.

Sahaja Yogi: So marriages on Saturday night, workshop in the Sunday morning and Puja in Sunday night.

Shri Mataji: Why don't you have Puja in the morning time? You see. In the cooler times we can have. So that's we have much more effect. You see, because before Puja you have the bhoots on your head, like just now I am having headache. So best is to finish the Puja, marriage, all auspicious things and then have the workshop.

Sahaja Yogi: So we will have the workshop at Sunday evening.

Shri Mataji: That will be the cooler time also, isn't that? So stay for that. [INAUDIBLE] it is hard. Today it was a real headache, I think.

Sahaja Yogi: Just the reporter who came in?

Shri Mataji: Yes. She was very, I think she wanted to be a good housewife or something and she couldn't forgive her husband. Too much of anger. [INAUDIBLE]

Sahaja Yogi: Very much. This is the reporter of Herald trying to talk at the end of the program.

Other Yogi: The amazing part was, she didn't want to speak to Mother anyway. That was the worst part. She just had enough she said, she got what she wanted, she said, from the program.

Shri Mataji: It's all right, give her a bandhan. You see this is all one has to bear. Very egoistical person, you see, and the ego is so much that I was turning her Agnya but she didn't allow to turn her either. That's how.

Sahaja Yogi: These sorts of people, who have a sort of mock embarrass, they put on the air the embarrassment. And they don't like to hear in public, somebody touching them, and the photographer was taking a photograph as she was carrying on, all sorts of absolute cheap stuff.

Shri Mataji: I say, what else you can not choose, can you? All types are there.

Sahaja Yogi: No. I mean she may write quite a good article.

Shri Mataji: So you see, just forget it. You see, just forget it. By thinking about it, you catch much more. Just forget it.
(Pause for a while...)

Nobody should feel bad about it. You see, all kinds of people are there. You just can't say what it is.

Sahaja Yogi: It is coming again very strongly now, it is coming very strong.

Shri Mataji: [INAUDIBLE] This will help, you know. So this is best to come out.
(Pause)

Better.

Sahaja Yogi: The children are sucking the vibrations.

Shri Mataji: Yah, ha, they are.

Sahaja Yogi: They really are.

Shri Mataji: I am very happy to see them there. They are such a help, such a help. (Pause) In India no child will miss My program. Isn't it? Everybody is there out. Any program. (Pause). So when will they arrive, on Saturday morning?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, 9 o'clock.

Shri Mataji: So Saturday morning how you can then have the Puja? You have Sunday morning Puja, is it?

Sahaja Yogi: We will have the marriages on Saturday.

Other Yogi: On Saturday night.

Shri Mataji: Its only preparations we will do. All right? So we will have to prepare.

Sahaja Yogi: Then Puja on Sunday morning.

Sahaja Yogi: Yesterday everybody sucked Mother's vibrations.

Shri Mataji: Also you see what is happening with the Sun. Sun is giving vibrations. Also it is sucked in earth quite a lot. She just added a little bit but I sucked it, that's all. I wouldn't say she is responsible of the whole of it, at the end of it. So much heat was there that has to be sucked. (Pause). So whatever I said about the school you are happy about that? In a short time what can you say?

Sahaja Yogi: It's gone half way and it created a lot of questions in the minds of the parents.

Shri Mataji: Hu...

Sahaja Yogi: That what sort of education their children are getting. They have some expectation from their children.

Shri Mataji: Actually the modern education is very ego oriented. It creates more ego than love and compassion. (Aside: No, I don't want that, I think I am quite full, I don't want that.). What they need is to teach children how to share, how to be compassionate, how to be collective. The education is not towards that, I think. The modern education, at all. But I have seen that the Chinese have thought of these things, Chinese have thought. Though they do not give realization but they work it out that way. (Aside: I don't need.)

Sahaja Yogi: Slow, slow, very slow (towards someone)

Shri Mataji: Really, I don't need this. All others, not me, I am all right? I am quite good. It will cool down Melbourne I think.

Sahaja Yogi: Two years ago, when you were in Melbourne you said the weather would change completely here and the seasons and it certainly did.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes we had a much milder winters and summers. And the rains have been coming just at the right time.

Shri Mataji: And the summer, is this kind of summer you never had? You must have a summer like this, very important, you see, for the ecological balance. When you have this kind of summer, then the Mother earth sucks in, you see, the rays of the sun. With that and, you see, all the leaves which are dried and all that they fall down, and also nitrogen is given. So that's how She gets more enriched by the calcium and the vitamin D, you see, that comes from the sun, helps her to consume the calcium and the nitrogen from the leaves that are there. And that's how She enriches Herself.

Now if you have a good summer, a real nice summer then also you'll find that you will have a very beautiful autumn. Your autumn will show beautiful colors and hues and red and yellow, this and that. Moreover this kind of a heat takes out the moisture of the Mother Earth, so the crusts are formed, and many minerals are created with that. With the heat only the minerals are created out of the same. You see, and all the changes take place through the heat from the Mother Earth and the heat from the Sun, you see. It's better to have from the Sun than to have from the Mother Earth because it can explode, into volcano or something. So, you see all these things are worked out in such a way that you get definite seasons, that's important. Otherwise like England now, all the time it is rainy season. They play, also they say, hockey with an umbrella on their head. I mean we have many places like England in India. Such a lot of belt of thousands and thousands of miles. But it is not inhabited, we don't think this is inhabited, because it is so cold so windy, rains such a lot. All the Himalayas, the foothill of Himalayas, are like that. We don't think it is very habitable. Don't use to it, you can get one square foot of land there for about one Anna, that is one sixteenth of a rupee. One square foot.

Sahaja Yogi: That's in a beautiful part.

Shri Mataji: Hu?

Sahaja Yogi: That's in a beautiful part.

Shri Mataji: According to you, according to us, is not beautiful. According to India this is not very beautiful. They think why should we fight the nature? Live in a place where you don't have to fight the nature. Even in Kashmir, you will be surprised, people are there only for summer. All the winter they come down to the plains, they don't stay. Otherwise centrality problem, this problem, that problem. They are not equipped also. (Pause for a while).

It was a good cross-section today, good cross-section of people. Two, three frivolous people came in. They just came in, sat down and went away. One fellow who came in the end, at the time when we've started our - when we had started our meditation, you see, so I would request you some people should be there. As soon as we start meditation, don't allow anybody to come in. And if somebody is going also, you should say that, you should not go. Or to be told not to disturb, halfway. Be careful, otherwise that person might just get the whole thing disturbed just waiting to say something. It's better to see, that they go out and you tell them that you should not have done. (pause)

Just now - just now it's not so hot. Isn't it? It's quite cool. Yesterday it was very hot at this time.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it was lot more.

Shri Mataji: So it just cooled down, definitely, isn't it? It has cooled down. You could not sit like this yesterday. There is no air-conditioning, just now working. (Pause) We better have the thing at the end of it. Because you see, that's why I was telling Warren, that before Puja, or before marriages, auspicious things, we should not have any workshop, because you see these people come with all their problems. So better, if you have it after that, it is al lright. But married couples should not be there, they should just go away at some other place. Those who are recently married because it's not proper.

Sahaja Yogi: Who has got newly married, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Who is married? A new person, who is married.

Sahaja Yogi: Nobody says that, they have already marriages.

Shri Mataji: Anybody like that who wants to marry. Newly. (to another yogi) You? All right. Where does he live?

Sahaja Yogi: He lives in the Ashram, here.

Shri Mataji: That's good. He is alone?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. He already has two children from a previous marriage.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. And the wife has gone away.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, got married to another. He just lived with the ladies who manage his children.

Shri Mataji: And they are with you?

Sahaja Yogi: No, the children are not with him.

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, they are not your children?

Shri Mataji: Oh, they are with the ladies? Oh I see.

Sahaja Yogi: But there is no claim on you on anything or ...

Shri Mataji: No, because he never married. That's why people don't marry these days. (laugh). This life so horrible, that you create more problems you see. There shouldn't be such a binding thing for marriage. It's the other way around here. Whatever you try with human beings you see, doesn't work out. This way or that way. Oh, just left side is also there, a lot of left Agnya, left Vishuddhi , its better now.

Sahaja Yogi: Actually it came up to left Agnya, no Mother?

Shri Mataji: Hu..

Sahaja Yogi: Mainly left Agnya. You could have strain.

Shri Mataji: So many people out of that night come before also. I felt that way. But they didn't come here. Now we will arrange it. I think we should have some more Ashrams also. So that they see this is not that far away like another end.

Sahaja Yogi: We are planning for that, aren't we?

Sahaja Yogi: Let's we have families here with children, who go to the school.

Shri Mataji: Ha.

Sahaja Yogi: So there should be some sort of transport route to get back here.

Shri Mataji: Ha.

Sahaja Yogi: For the school each day.

Shri Mataji: No, you see, you should have the children, and the mothers, and I mean the children should be staying here to begin with. And then the rest can shift. Don't disturb the children. For the time being. But if you have more children and if they allow you to have some sort of a portable thing to put up here, accommodation, then also those children mostly should be staying here will a better idea with their parents. Could be a better idea.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, with 50 people, about 24 parents and 25 children, it's a lot of people to have under one roof. And it is a little disturbing.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. I think, you see, those who have small children, need not stay.

Sahaja Yogi: That's the point.

Shri Mataji: Only those who are educated and going to have their children educated.

Sahaja Yogi: Little babies can go out.

Shri Mataji: And how many of them?

SahajaYogi: Elian and like that.

Shri Mataji: All with the little babies, should go out. Only the children who are studying here, their parents should stay. As far as possible.

Sahaja Yogi: That makes sense. That's very beautiful.

Shri Mataji: Or something close by so that this is not too much of for children to come to the school. But if you have these portable things and you can have more children, can you?

Sahaja Yogi: Well, we have to negotiate with the council. They have had the restriction because in the proximity there are other private schools which are in queue. So they just try to cut the numbers down so that this does not become the [INAUDIBLE] school in the area. They are fearing this school will grow to a very big school.

Shri Mataji: This one?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Other Yogi: How can it grow so much here?

Sahaja Yogi: They have in other places they bought next properties out, they keep buying the next properties. And just takes over the whole block. One school.

Shri Mataji: In this area?

Sahaja Yogi: As far it happens.

Sahaja Yogi: They have signed an agreement that we would not ask for any more students in this school.

Other Sahaja Yogi: Oh, I see. They had signed an agreement that at the time of applying of registration, that they would not ask for more than twenty students to come into the school.

Shri Mataji: So we'll start another school.

Sahaja Yogi: Another place. They won't object with that. The only thing is the physical location.

Shri Mataji: All right. That's good. We should have really schools of twenty children here, twenty children there, and twenty children in another place. It is a good idea. So we will get children from other places. You can.

Sahaja Yogi: We seem to be getting a lot of teachers or people with that sort of interest.

Shri Mataji: I think now they want to start one school in Perth, they want to start a school also in Sydney. Also maybe in Adelaide. School is a very good idea, is the best for the place like Australia, where the innocence is the main thing, to get good children. More children will be born here of that level. Realized children, Buddhas ...
(Pause)

Better now...

SahajaYogi: It is. Two little omelets, paratas..

Shri Mataji: These are the three centers are there what Buddha dealt with by saying, Dharmam Smranam Gachhami. Then Sangham Smaranam Gachhami. Buddham Smaranam Gachhami.

Sahaj Yogi: What is the meaning of each of those three mantras?

Shri Mataji: You see, "Buddham Smaranam Gachhami" means I bow to the enlightened ones. You see that means enlightenment. Secondly he says, "Dharmam Smaranam Gachhami", Dharma, I bow to Dharma. Because if there is not Dharma, Ekadasha catches. All right? The first "Buddhham", with enlightened means it is beyond ego. "Smaran" itself shows that you have to give up your ego. "Smaran" means surrender, I surrender myself to the enlightened one, to the Spirit. Then I surrender myself to the collectivity - "Sangham Smaranam Gachhami". Then "Dharmam Smaranam Gachhami" - to Dharma. I surrender myself to Dharma. These are the three parts. These are the most important three chanting.

Sahaja Yogi: Hmm, then where are the Buddhists with them?

Shri Mataji: Everybody is nicely upside down. With their legs towards God and heads towards hell - straight forward march. Nobody is sensible, nobody is sensible, some of them are stupid, some are egoistical, anything - but nobody is sensible, wise, nobody. Anyone you tell, like the Sufis, they are another stupid people, I just don't know how they can call them the Sufis.

Sahaja Yogi: This is not cold, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Little ice you may put. Or put it in the fridge. Or get little ice, I don't mind.

Sahaja Yogi: Put some ice, for now. We will have it in your room, Mother.

Shri Mataji: I will have some. Will go then and will sleep.

Sahaja Yogi: Well, it, Mother, you have to go to bed.

Shri Mataji: I think let me ....
