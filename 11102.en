In our heart, there is a flicker of light, which is burning all the time, which is Atma, the reflection of Parmatma in our heart. When the Kundalini rises, SHE opens the BRAHMHA RANDHRA. The seat of SADASHIVA the Pitha is in the Sahastrar, but Sadashiva is reflected in the heart as Atma. Pitha is created because it receives the subtle energy which is all pervading.

In the same way, Pithas are in the brain, and the Pitha of Sadashiva is higher up in the Sahastrar, which is opened out, so that the subtle, the sukshma, passes into our heart, through a very subtle channel. Just like a gas-light, it has a flicker, and when the gas opens out, the prakash (enlightenment) occurs. Vibrations are the passage of this subtle energy through us. These vibrations start flowing through us only after our Kundalini rises through the Bramharandra.

Vibrations give us complete balance, correct our physical being, our mental being and our emotional being. They give us a sense of complete spiritual oneness with God. They integrate us completely. â€” Mataji
