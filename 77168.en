All of us are looking for something in life, whether it's happiness, power, self-realization, spiritual feeling. There's a woman joining us now who's one of the few female gurus in the world. She is known as Ashri Mataji in translation that means holy mother, and she has been all over the world. Saying, ah, that there are things we need to look at in this world, things that really need to change, kind of, uh, uh, a revolution in a way, ah, it's a delight to have you here, Mother. Ah, would you first explain though, I think we all think we know what a guru is. Would you tell us what you do? You see, a person who calls himself a guru should be able to give you something of your own. You have everything within yourself. And only thing what he has to do is to activate that so that you become yourself. And he doesn't take anything from you.

He cannot take money from you, nothing of the kind. Just he has to give you what you have. He's like a banker. All right, you are from India and yet don't you base what you do on a belief in Christ and a belief in all religions? Of course Christ is very important. He's the gate, no doubt about it. What do people who follow your teachings, Mother, find in themselves? Is it a feeling of well-being? What, what do they seek through your teaching? Ah, lots of things because spirit is the one within us in our heart, which is collectively conscious, so you become your consciousness becomes collectively conscious.

That means on your central nervous system you can feel the. of the spirit in your heart, you can feel the all pervading power that does all the living work like changing the flowers into fruits and all those things. You start feeling that power. That's what Christ had. When somebody touched his robe, he felt some some energy went through him. That's what is the energy you start feeling. You become empowered. That's the sign of a woman who can give you something and take nothing. You worked with Gandhi in India, from my childhood I was with him for quite some time. And what did you learn from his spirit?

He, he was a soul, but at that time he felt it was important to get out of the slavery, otherwise we can't do any spiritual thing at all because if you are bodily enslaved, what can you do? And your husband is with the United Nations, he is the Secretary General. He's elected 3 times now as Secretary General of the International Maritime organisation. You know, I wonder if people think the way I do Maharishi Yogi was a product of the 60s and ah I think we think of him in a way perhaps with a lack of knowledge as anti-establishment. You are not really anti-establishment, not at all. I mean, this is absolutely untraditional. It's not like Indian style. There's nothing like establishment to be broken. You have to have your families. You have to have everything.

It's all God's own arrangement that we should have good families and good children, and we should do our own role very with complete confidence. You speak a great deal of the power of women. Yes, women have the most powerful thing. They are called a Shakti in India, but their power is not the way we understand the power. It's the power. The Mother Earth has, she has the power to nourish, has the power to give us all that we want. She's the one who looks after us. She's the one who fills our life with all these beautiful seasons as we are having now here. The colour is changing because it has got more of minerals in it and it changes the beautiful colours just to give us a choice. So that's the this is a brief glimpse at what you do.

And what you say, and I know you, you claim to touch people all over the world, and there is an open meeting that will be held tonight at the Old Cambridge Baptist Church that's on Mass Ave in Cambridge beginning at 7 o'clock. So for those of you who are interested in knowing more of what Mother is all about, perhaps you would like to attend. Thank you so much for being with us today. Shri Mata, nice to know you. And there is a power in the peacefulness of your face. Yes.
