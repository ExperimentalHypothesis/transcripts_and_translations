b'\n"Ego and Humility". "Nirmala Palace" Nightingale Lane ashram, London (UK) - 7 June 1982.\n\nWe had a very good session, I should say, and a very successful trip in Portugal and even better in Spain. Portugal is a place where gurus have touched very nicely because people are too simple I think, and because they are too simple they are affected too hard. And I was really confronted with so many sick people there who have been to gurus, who have been only for two, three years with them are badly affected and surprisingly how the whole thing is exposed, that we may be able to do much better in Portugal.\n\nNow, the Portuguese people get lot of wine. They drink a lot; they really drink. I mean, they have all kinds of wines in their country. Is a very big problem of that place, is it that has many wines and I think the drunkenness make them extremely lethargic and that lethargy brought down that empire. We can see it\xe2\x80\x99s a very huge place. I mean the buildings, if you see, are very beautifully done, lots of buildings with lots of architecture, and all that is like a desolate place. The reason is: the people who were at the time quite affluent, were doing well... Gradually unemployment started settling down, lots of strikes \xe2\x94\x80 just the same thing as I feel is happening in this country \xe2\x94\x80 and unemployment and amounting to starvation.\n\nFirst they used to get doles and all that, as we get here; gradually it stopped. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s so bad that all of them have to depend on their parents. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way. They have no source of income, very few industries. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the poorest country in the whole of Europe.\n\nThat made Me think about England, that we have to know that this country also may face a phase, if we do not get up now. You see it\xe2\x80\x99s all right to divert your attention to Falklands and all that, but it cannot feed you.\n\nSo, we have to understand, all the Sahaj Yogis must understand, that they all must have some sort of a degree or something on the paper; that\xe2\x80\x99s a very important. And though you are all realized souls and you are spiritually so endowed, everything is there, but you have to think of the whole. If the country completely goes down in its production and its capacity to activate itself, you will go down, too. So, your attention should be now, of course, you should not be materialistic, but towards putting more activity into you, even in Sahaja Yoga, in meditating, in working it out in yourself.\n\nSo, lethargy is not going to pay. And this is one thing, is such an inertia, such an inertia that exists, that unless and until you really put in complete willpower, this inertia may not be combated, may be very difficult, even in Sahaja Yoga. You see, it is very easy to escape and explain, you see, yourself, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I got up and, you know, this happened, that happened.\xe2\x80\x9d But, I think the symptoms are of a very dangerous type and as Sahaja Yogis you have to be very patriotic about it and you have to think about it. After all, you are symbols of the English people. Whatever works out in you will start working out in the rest. So, how you behave towards yourself and towards the general atmosphere is very, very important.\n\nNow, towards Sahaja Yoga also the attitude has to be understood very clearly. You see, like a Maharaja in India who lives in quite great comfort first of all, lives like a lord and he orders about, you see, and then everything is lost. But, still he talks like a lord, he behaves like a lord. His whole thing is the same way, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that the kingdom is there, that he\xe2\x80\x99s the ruler, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk like that to everyone, because the habits are formed.\n\nI think the mind also has formed a habit. The whole atmosphere is charged with such ego since long and that\xe2\x80\x99s why towards Sahaja Yoga also, the attitude has to be humbler, much humbler, because without humility you cannot do. That\xe2\x80\x99s one thing you must understand. Is no question of you rationally saying something about it or explaining about it. But, you see, basically one has to be extremely humble.\n\nFirst of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very big privilege to get realization. You know that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a greater privilege to go ahead, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest to be a Sahaja Yogi. Is a very great privilege that you have, which very few people have and you are the ones who are chosen specially. But, the humility part of it is still missing about Sahaja Yoga, about Sahaja Yoga. Like, we should ask, \xe2\x80\x9cMake me a better Sahaja Yogi, a humbler Sahaja Yogi, a compassionate Sahaja Yogi, a sweeter Sahaja Yogi. Dissolve my ego.\xe2\x80\x9d This is very important, we must understand, because whatever works out in you, will work out in this country.\n\nArrogance is something that with ego you can never understand you have been arrogant. The way you talk to others, the way you behave towards others, you will never understand, because there is ego. If you are standing in the darkness, the light is there but it is covered with something. How will you understand where is the light? So, humility must be there, because you people have very developed brains, very developed, over-developed brains and that brain can, you see, always tell you, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are better than others,\xe2\x80\x9d you see, always. \xe2\x80\x9cThe another one is no good and the third one is useless. You see, you are the best.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s typical of the brain teachings, you see. And when it starts working out, it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult, you see, to see that the one who is saying this is nowhere, because from the point where you see, you cannot see what you are saying. What you see is the whole thing as if you have to command it; you have to ask for it.\n\nOf course, the quality is very much changing now, everybody is becoming very, very, very sweet and sober and nobody now demands anything from Me like, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must give me this, Mother. You have to do it. You have to look after me. After all, I have been to Your Caxton Hall once, You see, and how dare You do not look after my mother when she met an accident?\xe2\x80\x9d Something like that. That\xe2\x80\x99s over now. That\xe2\x80\x99s over.\n\nThe quality is improving now and one has started learning now how to laugh at your own ego and this and that. But I personally think that one has to realize that if you represent this country to your Mother, then it has to improve still. \xe2\x80\x9cStill I have to improve. I have to go ahead. I have to go further with it and have I to develop that beauty of humility.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLike in Portugal they told Me Lord Byron, whom I think to be a useless fellow, absolutely good for nothing and I regretted every minute why he was created on this earth, he went and said that ... he went and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCintra is a very beautiful place. Cintra is too good to be wasted on Portuguese.\xe2\x80\x9d It should have been from Mr. Lord Byron, whosoever he may be. You see, typical! And it pinches everyone, you know. Everybody feels. But think if you are the person about whom he said.\n\nSo, one has to develop a kind of a humility that \xe2\x80\x9cI have to still receive; I have to still get it; it has to work out.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, when it comes to that kind of an attitude, then you turn round. Turn round upon yourself. What have you done for Sahaja Yoga? One question, simple question: what have you done for Sahaja Yoga? How many people have you given realization? How many people have you been able to cure? How much peace have you got within yourself? How much blissful are you? How much compassion have you got? How much forgiveness and patience you have for others? How much of sharing you can do? These are the signs of Sahaja yogis, that you break your shell. You become the collective. How much do you understand others? And how much do you understand giving [to] others? What have you given to others, even on material level? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. These questions should be put to yourself. On a very material level these questions are to be asked, on a very material level, because the light comes down up to material level. How many people you can forgive?\n\nYou are realized souls. You are prophets, no doubt. You can make others prophets, but you have to be the quality, also. The quality of a prophet is his nobility. He is so noble. Nobleness. In comparison with other people, who are not realized souls, he is nobler; he is more dignified; he is much more forgiving. So the whole way of dealing with others will change. He is obedient. We have to obey in Sahaja Yoga. We have to obey our good will. Otherwise, you are difficult people. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible. Nobody can do anything to you. If you are like a thorn, how can anybody help you?\n\nSo the quality of a Sahaja yogi is measured by another kind of a measure. Is not the way human beings measure the quality of other human beings. Like, somebody has a good taste, for example, so-called. Then people say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s great, with a good taste.\xe2\x80\x9d Or if he has a big car, then: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a big man.\xe2\x80\x9d Or he talks like that, or he walks like that, or says this, that and all those things. Or a question like this, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you say like that?\xe2\x80\x9d All these words, you know. They sound very hard to Me. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you do like that?\xe2\x80\x9d This kind of a language itself was not there in this English language.\n\nNowadays the language is so changed and very rude, very arrogant and very harmful. So, first ask yourself, because Sahaja Yoga will spread - of course, slowly and steadily, I hope - only through your images. You are the reflectors.\n\nYou put My thousands of posters. I am so unique, you know. They\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, this unique personality is taken out, no good. What about the disciples?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, actually whatever is in the lower level animals is important, like in lower level animals the king is the one. Say, the tiger has to kill an animal, big animal. It is he who only can kill. Till human stage also perhaps it is so. The one who can really dominate others, survival of the fittest, is the ruler.\n\nIs the other way round, now. It\xe2\x80\x99s changed, completely. How much free you are in your ideas, while you are still identified with old ideas.\n\nBut free doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean abandonment, by any chance. Freedom means you respect the freedom of others. First and foremost thing of freedom is that you must respect the freedom of others. Even God respects your freedom. He cannot give you realization if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want it. He cannot force it. So, respect the freedom of others. But, that does not mean by respecting the freedom of others there should be abandonment. If somebody is abandoned in Sahaja Yoga, he goes out of the circulation of Sahaja Yoga. It\xe2\x80\x99s not coming in so important, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you hundred times. It\xe2\x80\x99s the throwing out part of it, you see. Sometimes I feel I should use some glues to stick on. Maybe, the wheel can turn very fast and some of half-baked may be thrown out back again into the oven.\n\nSo, I feel, in these countries where I went, Spain, they call it. Spain, still half-developing; Portugal, developing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you think about Italy, whatever it is called. Very humble people, very humble from the very first day. Anyone who comes from the very first day, they are very humble and because they are humble, they are sensitive to Me; because you have to be really very humble to be sensitive to Me, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, because I\xe2\x80\x99m too simple, na\xc3\xafve, as if I do not understand anything. I look like that, I mean, as if I have no knowledge of anything - very simple woman, talks in a very simple way, is very friendly, all right.\n\nSo to understand Me you have to be extremely humble and if you cannot go to that level of humility you cannot see Me and you cannot understand Me. And the more you start understanding, the more humble you become, naturally, because you know what it is.\n\nSo, I have told you many a times about humility part of it, but My experience of these countries was where I went there. I mean, they are very humble people, very humble about Sahaja Yoga, extremely humble they were. Even the new people were very humble. Spanish people same thing, extremely humble. You see, Dawn had told Me that they have a ego of a bull fighter, but the one who came this time were so humble I was amazed. Even if I could touch them, that was sufficient for them. Nobody pulled My hand, nothing.\n\nSo, this is what it is: one has to understand that we have certain tags of our past which has to go down. The language should be extremely humble language. Try to read \xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whose language is so humble. Maybe Mine, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But, try to read books where people speak humble language, humble way of talking. You\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy it, really enjoy it. Humility is the glory of Sahaja yogis, is the only way they will grow. It\xe2\x80\x99s like putting your roots down and down and down.\n\nThe people who went from here were themselves amazed at the humility of the people who were there, very much amazed, the way things are working out there, the way they helped us and did everything for us. And I am sure now in Spain we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a very nice, very, very nice center. Of course, the Ambassador is a very, very humble man \xe2\x94\x80 you know him, too humble \xe2\x94\x80 and he might be coming here, and one day I want to call him here to the ashram also. He and his wife will be here. So, the Ambassador was very sweet and he called Me to his house, invited, and he had a nice tea party. He called Indians and everything and Indians said, you know they asked Me for one thing. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be shocked. They said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about something to depend upon?\xe2\x80\x9d you see. \xe2\x80\x9cCan we have Your photographs, something? It must be having some vibrations. Should we use Your photographs for our worship?\xe2\x80\x9d Can you imagine? And, at first I said that \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right. It will work out,\xe2\x80\x9d because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to take My photograph.\xe2\x80\x9d So she was so disappointed, the lady. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, there must be a photograph or something which we can use. After all, how can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d Just imagine! And here, first thing comes up, like a big snake, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Mother\xe2\x80\x99s photograph? She should give us realization, She should solve all our problems, all our sickness, everything, but why Her photograph? This is too much!\xe2\x80\x9d In this you can see the ego of the people.\n\nNow, regarding ashram, I had asked Nick, I had asked him to make certain rules and regulations. And I must say that, of course, Nick should say things, as you, somebody told Me that he should have been little softer with it and all that. But, supposing somebody is not soft at all: you must know that this is sent by Mother and you must do it. You see, actually, when you say no to him, you are saying no to Me also, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Because I sent him. I told him and I told him that \xe2\x80\x9cYou must carry out these things.\xe2\x80\x9d If you do not allow him to carry out, he has to be perhaps strict. By softer means, supposing something fails, then what to do? But I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know. After realization even if you do not do things, what should we do? Can you suggest?\n\nI mean, you should respect everyone. But say, even if you respect, people get up at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning; then what should you do? What should be done, you just tell us? John, tell Me. I mean, it is really surprising. You are now prophets. Do you understand your quality, what are you, what have I given you? Then what should we do about it? You see, these are so simple things, like children also. If you are in a hostel, you are made to get up in the morning, take your bath, get ready, walk out. I mean, if you do not listen, anyone, I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s simple. Then, what should one do with prophets? You just tell Me.\n\nThis is not the problem in Australia even. But English one going to Australia, create problems. I have seen. Sally, what a problem. Ba pre. You could see in contrast, her ego. Absolutely, in contrast I could see it clearly, very egoistical. Though she said that she was in \xe2\x94\x80 what place she was in? Jersey, and there bhoots got her. But all the bhoots were egoistical. That\xe2\x80\x99s the point. Such a contrast, you know.\n\nIf we have to grow as one body and you are enlightened, part and parcel, part and particle of the same body, supposing this finger says, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I will not do it.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, somebody is, say, putting a big attack or something and this hand says, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will not work out,\xe2\x80\x9d then what to do?\n\nActually, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very big dilemma for Me because a hand which is forced to do it will never do it properly. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t force it, then what happens to that hand? I mean, just see, the diligence is very important. We should not take things for granted. You see, we take ourselves for granted, everything for granted. Is not proper. We have to work hard. We have to work it out ourselves. You see, even if you have ten thousand Sahaja yogis, here, what is going to happen? The quality is so poor, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\n\nYou have to get up in the morning, do it, meditation. You have to grow. You have to grow still much more. And you know you are so very few, I have to use you only. Of course, nobody can force you. And even if you force, a forced labor is not going to help in Sahaja Yoga, that is. You take it from Me. It cannot. So, these people are nowhere, where do they stand?\n\nNow, anyone you tell the job. Say, Warren also, in Australia. There were jealousies about that, terrible jealousies.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should he tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d Because there is nobody to tell you within yourself. That\xe2\x80\x99s the problem is it. So, that which is sleeping, I put it into one man. All right, this man is going to tell, but, then that person tells you, then people feel jealous. I mean, these are not the signs of a prophet. A prophet is never jealous, because he knows he has achieved his powers now. He\xe2\x80\x99s in his own power and his power is of surrendering. Is not of overpowering.\n\nSee, you cannot see the other side of it. You think power means you sit on somebody\xe2\x80\x99s head, then, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very powerful.\xe2\x80\x9d Like a woman, if she can make her husband dance to her tune, then she thinks, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am the most powerful woman ever living.\xe2\x80\x9d Is the other way round, that the woman is so loving that husband can\xe2\x80\x99t do without her, that sort of a power. She\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet that the husband cannot manage without her.\n\nThat sort of a power is, should be the power of a prophet and these things are very much deeply put into us. So face it up and take it out. The whole value system is upside down. I tell you the whole value system is upside down. See My life, own life. As a wife of such and such and such I am expected to go into diamond shops, buy diamonds, wear, become a big lady with heels like that and walk with a neck like that and do all sorts. I mean, this is the normal thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s expected. And shout at the chauffeur, and shout at the servants and shout at everyone and behave in that manner. I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, the power is. You see, that\xe2\x80\x99s how the woman express their husbands\xe2\x80\x99 positions.\n\nBut, the other way round, is the situation of a prophet. The prophet asserts his powers through love. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much can you hate me? I\xe2\x80\x99ll love you double. Always, whatever you will hate me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll love you double of that.\xe2\x80\x9d Then what will happen?\n\nBut to love, one has to sacrifice, one has to give, one has to bear. Love doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hang in the air. That\xe2\x80\x99s one thing people don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Love is not only talking love or if you are little gentle to somebody is not the point. But even that bearing is a joy, because ultimately you are doing it for love. If love is the joy-giving thing, then that bearing is not much. You are doing it for love\xe2\x80\x99s sake. See, because love, unless and until it is shared you cannot enjoy. So, first we have to be strict with ourselves, I think would be a good idea, and loving to others. That may be the way we might work it out.\n\nBy God\xe2\x80\x99s grace we have a very nice place as an ashram. We might get even better place. You are the God\xe2\x80\x99s own blessed people. No one can believe that we could have such a nice place. But, what are we willing to do for it? That\xe2\x80\x99s the point, we should say. Don\xe2\x80\x99t take things for granted. I must warn you. I know England is the heart, but in God\xe2\x80\x99s realms one can create many hearts, not so difficult. So more harmony should be brought in. Even, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised, in France, it\xe2\x80\x99s so harmonious and so beautiful. Find faults with yourself all the time.\n\nNow, under certain circumstances I have to appoint somebody, like I would say very personally, I would say, Nick. Because Nick is doing no job nowadays, he is quite a systematic person, is all right, this thing. He has some problems, I know. You, too, have problems, all right? But he\xe2\x80\x99s the one available today and he\xe2\x80\x99s the one who is going to do it. Take one case. Now you must understand why Mother has appointed somebody, all right? Accept it. Because\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n(speaking about the children) It\xe2\x80\x99s a big dance, all that... They\xe2\x80\x99re trying to entertain... see, look at this dancing. They are feeling the tenseness of the situation and trying to entertain... That\xe2\x80\x99s it; that is love. See, they want to relax you, they want to relax you, they want you to feel nice, to be joyous. Look at them, in the same way, we should do.\n\nI am sure. I am sure now, henceforth. I think best thing is to make some poems. That may be a solution, all right? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. And let everybody start writing poems. Would be a good idea. And then that should work out. And sing the song of praises. It\xe2\x80\x99s very little way, just a very little way, just there in your heart, resides the source of all the beauty. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, turn your face towards that. That will work out. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will work out. It\xe2\x80\x99s not very far away.\n\n(aside) Let her also stand there, she\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy.\n\nNow, another point was that you are going to go to that peace mission or something. What peace? What is that supposed to be? In Brighton, you are? Peace festival, all right. And I\xe2\x80\x99m told Kay has written an article about it, peace. You know that peace is nothing without. It is within yourself and if you can feel your peace, then only you can start feeling peace for others. Sahaja Yoga is the only way; there\xe2\x80\x99s no other way out.\n\nYou see, at the level of, say, take the position of Falkland. Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s see, Falkland Island is a very immediate problem. Now at that level there\xe2\x80\x99s no solution. There\xe2\x80\x99s no solution. They are quite justified in attacking back Falkland, because these people were illegally there, because that\xe2\x80\x99s not a democratic country. They have destroyed so many people of their own. So, English were justified. Of course My all support was for them, because they were correct on the justice point. That\xe2\x80\x99s true. But, justice is a little half-baked, because for whom to fight? These unrealized souls, their right, for what? Even if you have democracy, if it is demonocracy, what is the use of having democracy? I mean, if through democracy, you are creating only demons, this demonic reign, then what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of having democracy, also?\n\nWhat about this so-called communism? All stupid people. To My eye, everybody is stupid and they cannot achieve anything at that level. You can say little bit, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, correct. After all, you see, that was their people were there under democracy. These people should have gone because they have killed so many people already in Argentina, they have no business and, of course, despotic law is against, absolutely against Sahaja Yoga.\xe2\x80\x9d So democracy is the best suited, no doubt. We have to support democracy. But, even democracy for what? Why to have democracy? To have the higher freedom. If you cannot have higher freedom, and it just means abandonment, you see, democracy means that an old man can marry a young girl and all sorts of nonsensical things. Then better not to have.\n\nSo democracy is only suitable to people who are dharmic, who have established their dharma. Otherwise, you really need a communistic country which will settle down your dharma most, to evolve out of it. But people think that democracy is for ruining your dharma, you have freedom to ruin your dharma as you like.\n\nYou see, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a very, you see, you cannot say. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dilemma again. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which way to go. It\xe2\x80\x99s another dilemma. So, to end up the dilemma you have to talk to people, that though it might be justified at this time, say Falkland thing, aggression, it\xe2\x80\x99s for peace, because next time they won\xe2\x80\x99t do such a thing again. Is really for peace, because next time such a thing they may not try, these despots, and there are all these Germans have gone and settled there. So, is a good thing.\n\nBut, still it\xe2\x80\x99s not peace, it has killed a lot of people. This thing has happened. Why? Because people are not realized souls.\n\nCome in, come in! Come inside, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of space here, move on. All those people who come first should come on this.. Can you move on this side, don\xe2\x80\x99t stand in there.\n\nSo, all these political institutions are a big joke, without realization. They\xe2\x80\x99re not yet fully human beings. They\xe2\x80\x99re not fully developed, because they have not found their spirit. You must find your spirit. Unless and until you\xe2\x80\x99ve found your spirit, no problem is going to be solved. Once your problem is solved, that is, to find your spirit, all other problems are solved. How now? What will happen? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. What will happen if we establish a kingdom of the realized souls?\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s hear... the scholar. What should happen?\n\nOf course, everybody will get up early in the morning, no doubt about it. Apart from that \xe2\x94\x80 that\xe2\x80\x99s the most difficult thing. Tell Me. Whatever you say will happen, so that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.\n\nYogi: Nobody will attack such a state.\n\nShri Mataji: There won\xe2\x80\x99t be any states. You see, God has not made any states. It\xe2\x80\x99s a madness. I tell you, when I was born, I was surprised. Oh God, what has happened? You see, God has not made any one of these states. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very different thing than what, you see, I expected. You see, God has made a beautiful land, all right, like this one, one sari like that.\n\nNow, you have to have some design, pattern, so He made some beautiful mountains and some nice, you can say, areas. And some are desert, some are rich. You see, it\xe2\x80\x99s to create \xe2\x80\xa6 the whole system, if you see, has worked out in such a way that you have equator, and you have the sun there, so the winds start moving. You see, it\xe2\x80\x99s all created so beautifully, so you have different types of countries and different types of places, this that. Now, after creating that, the human beings, stupid as they are, they divided themselves. I mean, it is stupid. I tell you really there is no need to divide like that. So they created states. There was no need to create a state. But you see it happened like this: that in the beginning they created state, because they wanted to have a, you can say, a hut to protect themselves, then a village, then a city, now a state. Now, after state what is the next situation? The whole world! The collective. This is the breaking through. Is one world. It is. I believe it is. To Me it\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense to see it in so many \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand walking in the, you see, this Customs and all that, carrying your passport, that criminal number so and so, and apart from that you carry your photograph and then tell so many things. Oh, by the way, My passport is completely filled now. Have to get another one. It\xe2\x80\x99s like that. You see, everywhere you go, you look like a criminal. They look at your face and then they stamp you. All right, you are stamped. Go ahead. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible. It\xe2\x80\x99s indignified, absolutely there. That means the human beings have no dignity left in them. I mean, this land doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to you at all. This is a land of God. You are of God and the land is. Nothing belongs to you, actually, to be very frank. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. So, what is a state? This is stateless. But stateless also means there is state in it. I say this is one world. This is, has been, is and will be.\n\nI mean you may in your myth, you see, hallucination, think it is different and fight. I sometimes feel you are just fighting your shadows. This is the, you have created shadows and the shadows are fighting and just to make the shadows fight, you fight. Otherwise, shadows don\xe2\x80\x99t fight. It\xe2\x80\x99s all a shadow. There\xe2\x80\x99s no truth in it. To Me it looks like that. It\xe2\x80\x99s all madness. What is there to fight? This is one world. Everybody is blessed by God. They all should enjoy His blessings to enter into the kingdom of God. He is the King. He is the one who is the ruler. In His kingdom there is nothing like a state. So that\xe2\x80\x99s a very different world you are entering into.\n\nThere are no alternatives there. It\xe2\x80\x99s only one absolute state of mind where you become the spirit, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. There\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be any aggression. Is stupid to be aggressive. There\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be any suppression. Stupid to do that. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to be suppressed and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to take any suppression. Everybody \xe2\x80\xa6 Why? Do you find that in the nature? Nobody does that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a harmonious living in the nature, even in the animal kingdom. You see, they know that a tiger has to live on an animal. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. That cattle has its own life, finished. Even they can understand the need, but, human beings don\xe2\x80\x99t. Their need is of spirit, and spirit hates, actually hates aggression. It cannot. It cannot. Even if it wants to, it cannot. It\xe2\x80\x99s indignified to aggress anyone, for a spirit, indignified. Absolutely, it is wretched. So, that is what it is, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll all enjoy love, love of God, His blessings, and all our limitations will drop off. So-called bhoots, as you call them, they\xe2\x80\x99ll all run away.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very different atmosphere of reality. This is all unreal, is absolutely unreal, is an illusion, I tell you, because you know that Brahma, His divine vibrations are doing everything. They are working out everything, even material things. Everything they can achieve. Apart from that, they give you that source of joy which takes you onto that atmosphere where you exist and enjoy. All the illusions created by human beings will drop out. This is all illusion. Believe Me, it\xe2\x80\x99s all illusion. There is no truth in it at all. But through illusion, you can work out.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very interesting thing that only through illusion you can work out, because when I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to you I have to keep an illusion of being here. Otherwise, you won\xe2\x80\x99t pay any attention. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see Me; you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know Me; you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to Me. So, you have to have an illusion. But, I know this is illusion. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. Living in this world, in this illusion, if you know it\xe2\x80\x99s an illusion, that\xe2\x80\x99s done. You are going to be tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s citizens, no doubt, of a very high level quality. The day will come when they will have to jolly well consult us. Already you have seen how I am playing tricks on the U.S. Did you hear the way the lady made mistakes, you see, the stupid things? Did you find that? I saw her photograph and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, this stupid woman.\xe2\x80\x9d She just raised her hand like that.\n\nNow they are realizing, you know, they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happens and then suddenly how they go amok. They\xe2\x80\x99ll all go amok and then they will have to find out how they should be controlled, what has happened, how did it happen. All these tricks one has to play, with all of them.\n\nNow, after the last war perhaps people may not come out with very aggressive words, perhaps, maybe, because it will be unpopular. But they\xe2\x80\x99ll do such stupid things, you see, to prove that they are good for nothing. All this can be done. But, you must know it\xe2\x80\x99s an illusion, all of you, because you are different things. You are seeing through different eyes. You know what is Brahma is. So, you must know it. And raise your quality. Raise your quality. In normal life, supposing, you see, like I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that somebody is a peon, then he dresses up in a particular way. Then he suddenly becomes an officer. Then he becomes a different style, you see, walks in a different way; his gait changes; style changes.\n\nSo, now you have become prophets, whole thing has to change. Either you don\xe2\x80\x99t accept this position, but if you are accepted this position and you are paid for it, then better be that. I mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t dress up like a peon if you are an officer, can you? It\xe2\x80\x99s all illusion, complete illusion. Whole thing is an illusion. All these kings of yours and queens are like dolls there before you. Especially Mr. Pope, you see, who came here. My grandson says, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Poke came here.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cPoke?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Pork. He was talking all rubbish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBecause all his chakras were catching.\xe2\x80\x9d And he is supposed to be the Pope in charge. Now, Bishop of Canterbury, see, is another funny man. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him on the thing. He was agnostic about everything. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about Christ also, maybe. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m agnostic.\xe2\x80\x9d Any question you ask him, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m agnostic.\xe2\x80\x9d Is a very good escape he has got, you see. He\xe2\x80\x99s agnostic of about everything, because he says, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a mystery to me.\xe2\x80\x9d So, what are you doing there? I mean, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a mystery to you, you\xe2\x80\x99re agnostic. I mean, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how is he there. So, some people have taken up upon themselves this crusade, I believe, and to talk to him. I mean, how can you talk to your shadow? Can you? So, the people live in the shadow state, and you should not symbolize yourself as shadows. You should symbolize yourself as reality and look at them as shadows, you see. In a way, in a very dignified way, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a shadow, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d Just pick it up, but, not in an aggressive way, but have compassion about them. Say, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, sir, this is not so. You are sadly mistaken. You see the shadow of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe whole Christianity is doomed because they started running after shadows. This Mr. Saint Paul, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how he came into Bible. Now, you are a theologist. You tell Me, John. How did he enter? I mean, anybody who says he saw Christ, is he supposed to enter into the Bible? How did he? I mean, his saying and his words and his letters are regarded as the letters from the Bible, after Christ. Before Christ is all right, but after Christ. What is the validity? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. What is the credibility of this person entering into that as an authority? How? When nobody challenged him. He was a man who was killing so many people before. Then, suddenly he becomes something and he starts saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m doing Christ\xe2\x80\x99s work,\xe2\x80\x9d and this and that and writes letter to Corinthians and all these people and all that. And why these letters that he writes becomes a Bible? Can you imagine? What did he do in his own lifetime? Half of it he spent in killing and half of it is he was an imposter. I am happy that it has come to your notice. But one can ask, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Why is he there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow, he started this charismatic thing; he is doing all this. I first saw it in India. There\xe2\x80\x99s a Saint Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Church. They\xe2\x80\x99re all possessed people, you know, and one of My uncles was the priest of that. He was a very possessed man, very hot-tempered, horrible. And when I saw that, I wanted to see the Saint Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Bible what he has written about. I was amazed. But I said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet you people read and see for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d And this horrible charismatic movement is anti-God activity, absolutely anti-God activity.\n\nSo, if you have to talk to the gentleman, you have to tell him about it, that it is possession. The Seventh Day Adventist and what other is this Pentecost, is nothing but that. Jamaicans are doing, all of them are great spiritually-developed people \xe2\x94\x80 spiritually in the pub. I mean, there should be certain norms, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, about a person who is supposed to be a prophet or something, something to do with God, you see. The world is coming to a position where they are understanding; but you see, once they start disregarding, the danger is this: once they start disregarding these things, because they are myths and falsehood, they will disregard also God and all the truth about God. They can become communists. That\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest way. Then there is no return. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dangerous situation. When you talk to him you have to tell him, warn him. Already your churches are selling here. Nobody goes to church.\n\nNow, about the environment. They are having a meeting on environment. That, too, is only solved through spirit. All environment problems can be solved only spiritual, if you have spiritual ascent. Otherwise, you cannot. You try anything; it\xe2\x80\x99s like patching up the sky. See now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very deep-rooted thing that we don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that spirit is the most practical thing. You see, we think spirit, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s like a drunkard, you know. Spiritual man, he\xe2\x80\x99s a cult, he\xe2\x80\x99s a drunkard, he\xe2\x80\x99s most abnormal. He\xe2\x80\x99s funny. Either he hits people or runs away from them. This is the idea we have got about a spiritual personality.\n\nBut just see you are spiritual. You will find it impossible to use plastics after some time, because you will know that the plastics give you horrid vibrations. After some time you will really find it repulsive. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right to sit in a train for a while on a plastic coach, all right, but, to sit in your house on a plastic all the time would be horrible and to wear a plastic coat all the time, our body will refuse. So when people will be spiritually awakened, they\xe2\x80\x99ll give up all these nonsensical things.\n\nSo, they may say then, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will happen to the machines?\xe2\x80\x9d Now, machines are for us; we are not for the machines. This is another concept is: whatever is created is for us and we are not for that. All right, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Nothing will go wrong with the machines. Machines should be used for anything that is a public work. Like for your motor cars, for your trains, trams, all public work which is outside. For houses at the most you can use machines.\n\nBut, for personal things, you must use handmade things, handmade things. For spiritual people, you like to wear something that is handmade or real. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wear a nylon sari. Not that I am very fussy about things, but I just can\xe2\x80\x99t wear. After some time, if I do not take out My socks, which are only nylon, what to do? My vibrations get jammed, completely. So, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to wear next to your skin, near your skin, near your body, eating your food, everything in plastics, cooking in plastics. I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s too much. Thank God, cooking I don\xe2\x80\x99t think is possible, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But aluminium is another thing. Is very bad. Aluminium - you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to use. You\xe2\x80\x99ll either try copper or brass, I think so. Now, handmade things we may have, because they are made by hand, so they have vibrations. People would like to have handmade. It is a part, so by that we remove the disparity of the world.\n\nDeveloping countries can do handmade things. You cannot beat them with computers. Can you? You go ahead, mad with your computers. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come back.\n\nYou must understand the whole. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the whole, this is what is happening: like mad, you know computers are going ahead, ahead. Where? Into the ditch, into a big mountain. Now they have created a big mountains of plastic and they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with it. So, and now with computer, what will they do? They\xe2\x80\x99ll create a greater mountains out of plastics. Maybe a Himalaya might be created, with the computer.\n\nSo the developing countries should not try to follow these mad people on one side. They should develop their hand things and all that, because they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come back. Now, the handmade things in this country are so important and so expensive. You don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether it is pressed (priced?) or not. But in India you have to take nylons, because they say nylons is a symbol of development, not of over-development, perhaps, but of development. So they must take to nylons and plastics and to stainless steel and aluminium, if possible. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we are doing.\n\nWhen you have less things consumed like that, you use less things from your motherland, because handmade you cannot go on mad like a machine goes, like a rakshasa eating away everything and producing more. It has to live like that. It\xe2\x80\x99s not economical. So when you have handmade things you have more value for your things, you look after them better, you feel better, you are comfortable and you need not be that smart, you see, machine-made. That idea of smartness is going down.\n\nSo, the developing countries should also learn a lesson. They are going after you. They are running fast. They try to run faster; they cannot. Thank God, they cannot. But they should stick on to that side. You see, one part of the country has to do something; another part has to do something else.\n\nBut, you people have to look after the side of machines, all right? I mean, handmade things, what can you make? Some ceramics, I think \xe2\x94\x80 apologies, some apologies for that. You better do what you know better and let them do what they can do better and share it. If this balance is established, there\xe2\x80\x99s no aggression. Unemployment can be solved. All the problems can be solved, if you take to handmade things. We should take to handmade things as far as possible. Sahaja yogis should use handmade things. I mean, not the cars, but for their personal use. Even I would say, soaps that you use are horrid. The soaps that you get in England are not meant for your skins at all, for Sahaja yogis\xe2\x80\x99 skin. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear them. What you have to use is natural soaps that you get from any country you feel like, but natural soaps, which come from natural oils.\n\nFoods also, natural food you must eat, more natural food, than artificial. All that will give you a better living and that is called as alternative, all right. That\xe2\x80\x99s alternative is important, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you go on a bullock cart. You can export your trains to India, or your cars to India and get khadi from there. All right? Mutual understanding, because we are part and parcel of one whole and we just cannot exist by our only growth because then we become malignant, you see. One cells eats another. You have to. If you have a machinery, you have to eat other, because you produce so much. You must find markets for them, you must supply them, you must send over and then you must have other countries to exploit them.\n\nPeople have tremendous respect for Mahatma Gandhi, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if people understand what he said about machinery. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the people who are doing machine work should give up, by any chance, but, some of them they can close down. For example, plastic toys for children is horrifying. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even get wood toys now \xe2\x94\x80 nothing, just plastic. They are touching plastic. I mean, imagine, you cannot feel any plastic.\n\nSo, this is what a sane Sahaja yogi has to understand. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you can solve the problem of environment, also. Thank God, somehow with your affluence and too much of machinery, all the western people \xe2\x94\x80 I am happy to know, even in Portugal \xe2\x94\x80 realize the value of handmade things. But in India if you offer somebody in an handmade thing they\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh God, they have no money.\xe2\x80\x9d But stainless steel, \xe2\x80\x9cGreat.\xe2\x80\x9d In a stainless steel, glass they\xe2\x80\x99ll give you tea, you see \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s very big. If you give it in a ceramic, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what this, village craft?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey are to be told. But, if you create a demand, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right; they\xe2\x80\x99ll look after their handmade. And here you can\xe2\x80\x99t do much. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, you see, that neatness, that deftness is not there; that\xe2\x80\x99s lacking; all lost it. Very few people have that left in them. Even if they have to cut one coat with their hands, they cannot do it. They have to use a machine, which cuts twenty-five coats at a time, you see.\n\nThen this problem of, you have to have a figure exactly because these only can fit certain figures. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have your own independent figure. This is all machine-like stuff, you see. You all must have that figure, otherwise doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit it. So, that is an ideal figure. So, everybody works out for that. See, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new machinery comes up, you see, for that kind of a thing, then new styles come up. It\xe2\x80\x99s such an artificial thing, all man-made, artificial.\n\nFrom your democracy, your politics to your economics, to all your so-called ideas of creativity, everything becomes so artificial. Now people can\xe2\x80\x99t paint. What they paint, if you see, you are just aghast. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is this supposed to be. And it is supposed to be so that it looks, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a hand, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see that?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit showing.\xe2\x80\x9d They can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. We can\xe2\x80\x99t have Shakespeare, we can\xe2\x80\x99t have Gauguin, we can\xe2\x80\x99t have anyone of that type. We can\xe2\x80\x99t have, say, Abraham Lincoln. You can have only machines, you see, bolts and nuts, fitted nicely. You\xe2\x80\x99re fixed, you\xe2\x80\x99re fixed, you\xe2\x80\x99re fixed, you\xe2\x80\x99re fixed. Everybody fixed nicely. Where do, I mean, this brain go? Where will this heart go? What will it do then? It cannot collapse. I mean, as long as you are existing, the heart has to beat. 01:09:53 So all this artificiality has to be overcome by Sahaja yogis. The responsibility is so great. Such a big building you have to bear on your shoulders, and the foundation stones have to get up in the morning to be chiseled out properly.\n\nSo, I end up My lecture today.\n\nMay God bless you!\n\nNow I am getting self-conscious. Will you please put it off? All right. Now, today I have come specially to discuss about\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nH.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi\n'
