I bow to all the seekers of Truth. At the very outset we have to know that Truth is what it is. We can not think about it, we can not change it, and at this humane awareness we can not know it. We have to know what is the Truth. The Truth is that actually we are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, but we are pure Spirit. We say, “My body, my conditionings, my ego”, but who is this “My”? You see all these beautiful flowers, we do not understand or not even think that this is a great miracle. It is a miracle, that from a small seed these flowers have come out. And the different flowers from different seeds so beautifully. Who has organized this? Who runs our heart? The doctors will say, “It is the autonomous nervous system”. But who is this “Auto”? All these questions start coming into your mind. So we take to various things and try to find an answer. Science also has its limitation. And we should understand that it can not answer many questions. One of them is, “Why are we on this Earth?”, “What is our purpose?” If science could answer that question, it could talk about the Absolute Truth also. But it can not give these answers. So now we have to look into ourselves and see for ourselves how are we here as humane beings. 

We have come they say through evolutionary process. But is this the end of our evolutionary process? Christ has said that, “You have to be born again”. All the religions have said the same. But it has to happen. It can not be just a lecture from Me but it is a happening, which should take place. So now today you are all here to know about the subtle centers, the subtle system that is within you. But you have to keep your minds open like scientist. And if it is proved then you have to accept it. If you are honest you will accept. Because it is for your individual benevolence, it is for the benevolence of your children. It’s a benevolence of your country and of the whole world. Because most of our problems come from humane beings. And all these problems come to us when our centers are out of order. If somehow we can manage to correct these centers, then all our problems are solved.

So when this Kundalini power, which is resting in the sacrum bone, triangular bone, is awakened, it passes through six centers, ultimately through the fontanel bone area and connects you to this All Pervading Power, which does all the living work. Thus your physical problems are cured. Definitely Sahaja Yoga has cured many incurable diseases and there are many doctors who are following Sahaja Yoga. There is a scientific explanation of everything. In Russia we have about two hundred doctors following Sahaja Yoga.

There are other problems which are mental within us. And these are coming out of our over worries and also too much thinking, we get into stress and strain. And many people are also trying to do things, which they should not do and they get into lots of mental problems. People become schizophrenic or they become lunatic, all kinds of mental problems are there, which can be solved through Kundalini awakening. 

The third problem comes to us is spiritual. Because we are seeking whether we know or not our Spirit. So there are many people nowadays who have come as false and they are trying to mesmerize people. This morning one young boy came in My room and he started talking like a mad man. I was really surprised how this young man is mesmerized. But there are people who try to mesmerize because they want to earn money out of you. How much money did we pay to Mother Earth for these flowers? How much money is required to run this body? To whom are we going to pay? It is spontaneous, Sahaj, means “born with you”. It is built in in this flowers that they should sprout and built in in this Mother Earth that they should sprout. So it is built in in you also. This is your power, this is your right to become the Spirit, solve your physical problems, mental problems and spiritual problems. 

That’s not the only thing that happens. We are humane beings and we always try to get to habits, which destroy us. All these habits drop out because we get wisdom within ourselves and this wisdom cures us. Like, supposing, if I have a snake in My hand and there is darkness, I can’t see and I’m obstinate and if somebody says, “There’s a snake!” I’ll not give up. Till that snake bites Me I may not give up. But we, some or other, there is some light and I see in the light – it’s a snake, I’ll throw away Myself, nobody has to tell Me. Because you become your own guide, your own master. You see, this is enlightenment, as we call in Sanskrit [SOUNDS LIKE – bodha], from where Buddha word has come, Buddha. That means you have to feel this Reality, this All Pervading Power, on your central nervous system, that you should know everything about it. It is not something secret. There is no secrecy in Sahaja Yoga. Everyone knows everything. They know how to raise the Kundalini, they knows where the chakras are in problem, they know everything. That is how a one person can give Realization, enlightenment to thousand people. 

This is the time of enlightenment, of the Last Judgment. They call it [SOUNDS LIKE –Kiyama] in Koran, where it is said that your hands will speak and they will tell you all about you and about others. This exactly what happens that on your fingertips you can feel your centers and you can feel the centers of others. Thus you develop Self-knowledge and also you become collectively conscious. That means a microcosm becomes a macrocosm. Means a drop becomes the ocean. Then in the whole world you don’t know how many brothers and sisters you have. There are fifty five nations where Sahaja Yoga is working and you have brothers and sisters all over the world. It’s like anything happens to your one finger the whole body caters to it. So anything will happen to a gentleman in Ukraine, people may come from America or Germany or from India, anywhere. Because you know the absolute Truth. Even small children can tell you what’s wrong with you. They can also give Realization. They are more soothed I think. They are more soothed, children are. 

But we have to know that our innocence is never lost. It is eternal. Only by our mistakes we might have covered it with some clouds. But after you have established your connection with this Divine Power then you are amazed you become an innocent person. You develop your own sensitivity inside to your own peace. You become extremely peaceful and that peaceful nature of yours will bring forth the future of a new age where there won’t be any wars. Family is improved, children improved, every way we find people like angels. Your attention becomes innocent and very effective. Wherever you pay attention it works. Your powers are great, which you do not know. And also the knowledge, which is a pure knowledge within you, that starts manifesting. 

The whole thing looks fantastic, but you are fantastic. It’s like if you take a television in a very remote village of India and say that, “You can see films and this”, they’ll say, “This box, how can we see in this box all the films?” In the same way we also think we are just boxes. But we are not. You’ll be amazed how dynamic we’ll become, how compassioned we’ll become. So all this is for you and you can have it tonight, this ascent. Of course you can’t pay for it and you don’t have to do anything about it. It’s just all there. After getting Realization then of course you will have to spend little time in the collective and learn all about it. And you have to master it. Anybody can do it. If you are educated or uneducated makes no difference. But it’s not meant for idiotic people, or stupid people, or for people who are very arrogant, or for people who are mesmerized, or who are involved in some stupid organizations. 

So I have to tell you that this will take hardly about ten minutes. But I can not force it on you. You have to ask for it. You have to have pure desire about it. Because I respect your freedom. Those who don’t want to have should really leave this place.

Now there is such a lot of knowledge which I can not tell you in one lecture. But like these lights you have to just put one switch and they are on. But if I have to tell you the history of electricity, then how it was brought here to Kyiv, how it was brought here, will be bored stiff. It’s better to put the lights on. Because it is built in.

There are three conditions, which you’ll have to fulfill, which are very simple. The first one is that you are not to feel guilty at all. After all you are humane beings and only humane beings can commit mistakes. You are not God. If you have committed mistakes you should face them. But don’t put it as a guilt because it spoils this center here. And this center is very dangerous because it gives you a disease called angina. Also it gives you spondylitis and lethargic organs. So it is a myth – to feel guilty. You are humane beings at the epitome of evolution. So please do not in any way condemn yourself but forgive yourself. Because if this center is not all right the Kundalini won’t rise.

The second condition is very simple is to forgive everyone. Logically whether you forgive or you don’t forgive you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. You play into hands of people who want to trouble you while they are quite happy. You are torturing yourself for nothing at all. But if you forgive then you’ll fill much lighter. So please forgive everyone. Even not to think about them. Just forgive in general. I tell people that, “Tell all the flowers, all the trees that we have forgiven everyone.”

Now the third condition is that you have to have full confidence in you. Please do not condemn yourself. Please be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. Don’t believe people who tell you, “You are sinners”. We’ll prove that you are not. So have full confidence in yourself. And the confidence that you will get your enlightenment today, your Self-Realization today. First it will happen that you will become thoughtlessly aware. Means you will be aware but there will be no thoughts. That is the state when you will be in present. We can not be in present; we are always in the future, in the past. There you will be in the state of peace. And present is the Reality. The past is finished and the future doesn’t exist. So you have to be in present. So first thing becomes is thoughtless awareness, a new dimension in your awareness.

Secondly I have told you that you become collectively conscious. You can feel this All Pervading subtle Power on your fingertips. And you can feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head, of the Kundalini coming out of your head. Everything can be verified, is absolutely tangible in Sahaja Yoga after Realization.

So now I’ve to request you to take out your shoes if possible. Those who are sitting on the ground are all right, but they should take out their shoes in any way. But those who are sitting on the chairs and benches should put both their feet apart from each other because these are two powers – left and right.

So now please (Shri Mataji speaks aside, “Somebody should come up to show) please see what you have to do, how to nourish your own center, you will do it to yourself, you will raise your own Kundalini. Can you all see him? (The interpreter, “Yes, Shri Mataji”.)

Now, please put your left hand on your left lap and sit comfortably. You don’t have to go to Himalayas and stand on your heads, it’s very simple. All right. So now put your left hand on your lap. This is symbolic that you desire to have your Self-Realization. Because the Left side is the power of desire. And the Right side is the power of action. So we use the right hand for nourishing our centers.

First you please put your right hand on your heart. Here resides the Spirit. Those who are standing if they sit down would be better for them. Please, here. Now in the heart resides the Spirit. If you become the Spirit you become your guide, your own master. So take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, we are working only on the left hand side. This is the center of your mastery. Is created by great prophets. Now take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge. Now we raise our hand again in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Then we raise our hand on our heart again. Then we raise our hand in the corner of our neck and shoulder and put our head to our right. I’ve already told you that this center goes into trouble when you feel guilty. Now please take your right hand to your forehead across and put your hand on it and put it down – your head. This is the center for forgiveness. Now take back your hand on the back side... (Shri Mataji speaks aside, “Will you please stop photographing at this time. Just later on”.) Take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. This is the center where without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from this All Pervading Power. Now please stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers and put down your head. Pushing back is very important to put a proper pressure on your scalp. Now move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise. Push back your fingers. That’s all we have to do.

Now you have to close eyes. Please close your eyes. (Shri Mataji speaks aside, “This gentleman can stop it now would be better”.) Please close your eyes. (Shri Mataji speaks aside, “I mean it’s all right if the film is going on, is all right. It’s all right, try to put the flash. Not to flash.)

Now please close your eyes. Put your left hand on your left lap and put both the feet apart from each other. Now put the right hand on the heart and close the eyes. Please don’t open them till I’ll tell you. At this center you have to say or ask a question, which is very fundamental, about you. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. And ask a question three times, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

I have told you that if you become the Spirit you become your master. So now please take your hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it. Here ask Me another fundamental question three times, “Mother, am I my own master?”

I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom; I can not force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. And here you have to say six times because this center has got six petals, “Mother, please give me pure knowledge”.

As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising. So we have to enrich our upper centers with our full self confidence. So raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now here you have to say with full confidence, “Mother, I am my own master”. Say it ten times.

I’ve already told you that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego but you are the pure Spirit. So raise your hand on your heart and say it with full confidence, “Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

This All Pervading Power is the ocean of knowledge, of joy and bliss. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself and raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and here you have to say sixteen times with full self confidence, “Mother, I am not guilty at all”. Please put your head to your right.

I’ve explained to you that if you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. As it is you have tortured yourself. You have tortured yourself and now if you don’t forgive this center is the most constricted center will not open and the Kundalini also won’t pass out. Now please put your right hand on your forehead across and put down your head. This is the center where you have to say from your heart not how many times, “Mother, I forgive everyone in general”.

Now you have to take your right hand on the back side of your head. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this All Pervading Power. Push back your head. Please say from your heart again not how many times, “Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly”.

Now last center, which is very important, you have to stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Here please stretch your fingers well so that there’s a good pressure on your scalp. Now please put down your head. Here again I can not force Self-Realization on you so you have to ask for it. Now move your scalp slowly seven times saying, “Mother, please give me my Self-Realization”. (Shri Mataji blows in the microphone 9 times.)

Now please remove your hands. Open your eyes please. Put both the hands towards Me like this. Put the right hand towards Me like this and put down your head and see with the left hand if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Put the right hand towards Me. Sorry, put the left hand, and see for yourself if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. If you have not forgiven it would be hot breeze. Now put the left hand towards Me. And put down the right hand on top of your head, bend your head and see for yourself there’s a cool breeze coming out of it. (Shri Mataji speaks aside, “Who is this man who is taking photographs? Is he from some? He’s not a Sahaja Yogi? He’s not a Sahaja Yogi. No, you can’t take photographs. Not allowed. Who is he from? No, without permission how are you taking photographs? Take out his film. No, you can’t take. You might take My permission. Only Sahaja Yogis are allowed.)

All right. Now put your right hand towards Me and again see with the left hand...(Shri Mataji speaks aside, “Please take out the film. He has already taken lots of photographs. He can not do it. Can not do it without permission you should have”.) Just see with the left hand.

Now put both your hands towards the sky like this and ask a question, “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Or second question is, “Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love?”, and the third question is, “Is this the Parama Chaytanya?” Ask anyone of these questions three times.

Now please take down your hands. Now put your hands like this towards Me. And don’t think. All those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands, or hot breeze in their hands, or in their fingers, or on top of their head, hot or cold breeze, please raise both your hands. Just turn the lights, I want to see the others also. Can you turn the light there?

Oh! This side also.

May God bless you.

Now you have to come to the collective and really master it. I know that there will be no more troubles and diseases anymore and you’ll all prosper very well in life. You will see the blessings every minute, miracles all the time. Thank you very much.

I will come next year again to Ukraine. But till then I want you to be great Sahaja Yogis. And everyone must give Realizations to others. And throughout Ukraine you should give Realization. You all have that power now. Thank you.
