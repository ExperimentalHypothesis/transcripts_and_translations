Public Program. Mytholmroyd (UK), 30 July 1982.

I think some of the Sahaja Yogis are rather amazed that I accepted New Castle’s invitation to come to this place. 

It has been very kind to call me here.

Every place has its own attractions, as far as Divine is concerned.

And I knew there must be some very deep seekers in this place.

They would really benefited if I could visit this place.

And I was overjoyed to arrive here.

Now the questions about Sahaja Yoga is very simple to understand.

All that is vital is extremely simple. For example the way we breathe is so simple. We don’t read any book, we don't do any exercise for that.

We don’t have to go and learn from any one, we just do it. 

In the same way, if our seeking has some meaning. And if we have to find out something, it must be the most vital thing. It is not just an alternative life. Many people have a feeling that the seekers are nothing but they finding an alternative way to life.

To alternate with the present, normal person’s condition. It is not so. 

The time that is today, the modern times, are special times described in the ancient scriptures in India, and also in Bible and Koran.

In all the scriptures, they are described.

In the Koran they are described as the resurrection time. Christ has many a time talked about it, that you have to know My Father forever. That your hands will speak. Lots of descriptions he has given of this state which you will achieve and become. As it like, you have seen, a tree has to grow. 

First it may have just one or two flowers, but when time comes, that the same tree which has only one or two flowers, 2 years back, 3years back suddenly gets into a blossom time and has lots of flowers. 

Like that, today is the time of blossom time for all the seekers.

So many seekers have taken birth today on this earth.

Especially England it has been described by William Blake. He said that the time will come, when England will become Jerusalem. 

Jerusalem means where it will be pilgrimage. For people will be in the Holy land of God. That people will come to this Holy Land, to visit this place. So the people have come to England. It is not the trees that will become Holy, it is not the land that will be Holy, but it is the people. Their hearts have to become holy.

How do they become holy? What happen to a person when he really become holy? We talk of saints, we talk of prophets, what is the difference between these people and ordinary people? There is only one difference.

The difference is this, that in their attention, in their central nervous system, there is the light of their spirit. While for the other people, they live in ignorance without the light of the spirit.

The spirit exists, in everybody. It is always there present, all the time. It is all the time present within us, but the problem is we are not aware of it. It is not shining in our attention, in our awareness. When Gavin told you about the new awareness. Which means the awareness that we have, the human awareness, becomes enlightened, a new awareness, and in that awareness, what happens is our spirit manifest.

Now one may say, Mother it must be a difficult thing. People have to do so many tapasya, they have to do so much penances. They have to go to Himalayas and do all kinds of things, standing on their heads for this together. How is it that it is working so easy now?

Actually that kind of thing is not needed today.

Because the time has come.

When the time has come, it just work out fast.

It works out en masse. I am with you here. In India, people have visited with me would know, there are thousands of people for every program I do there. And all of them get realization. All of them get realization, means they started feeling the all-pervading power for the first time on their hands.

First time about all-pervading power about which Christ has described.

Every scripture has described, you start to feel it as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

Now, this feeling somebody can say, could be due to this, could be due to that, because we are doubting ourselves some times. This type of doubting. But the thing is, you can see, if so many people feel the rising of the power through the triangular bone which is called as sacrum. Surprisingly sacrum means sacred. That means that Greeks knew that it is a sacred bone, it is sacred, nowadays this word has no meaning, but it will come back when people realize what is sacred. 

In this bone, the triangular bone, we have this power called kundalini settled down. This residual power which creates us, which creates the whole being, is still not manifested. It is still sleeping because it is the power of our desire which is the ultimate desire to become one with the spirit, to feel the all pervading power, to be the instrument of the God.

Until this power, or we can say this power of desire has manifested itself, we are not going to be happy people. You can try anything you like. Now in the beginning you may say, that so many prophets came here. Christ came here, all of them came just to make us ready for this day when we can be born again. Christ has clearly said you have to be born again. Who is bothered about it?

There are people who have certified themselves, born again. 

Christ didn’t say certify yourself and born again. Born again means a person who has felt this all pervading power. Who can make this all pervading power flow through his being.

And can manoeuvre it and understand. 

About this all pervading power creates the power that all powers have been created. All this electricity, everything is part of that power. That is the vitality of the whole universe that has created this universe. This all pervading power that flows when you get your realization, gives you tremendous powers, but the biggest power with you is to love. God is love, and His power is power of love. He lives in ourselves, He loves us so much, that He is the one who wants to save us, it is He who is anxious to save His creation. He doesn’t want that His creation which He has created with such love with such attention, with such dedication, out of which you are the epitome of His creation.

The human beings are the highest, to be destroyed. That He cannot bear. And it is His desire that the flowering today of Sahaja Yoga and people are getting self realization in such a mass quantities.

But the main problem today is that there are so many in the market, that people don’t know what to do.

To begin with, we have churches, we have mosques, we have temples, we have all kinds of people selling God.

Or people talking about God, or saying that this is God.

Now these religions came on this earth. All the prophets came on this earth, to establish a balance within us. As I told you to prepare us for the ultimate. But I’ve noticed, without enlightenment what is the use? Whether it is Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism, all these isms, it is fanatic belief.

The reason is without the light, you can not see. 

For example, I come to see the table. There is no light.
To me, there is only a table, other doesn’t exist. The other person will come and see a chair. To only this chair, nothing exists. Now this myth he believes into, he has just established. Because he is not enlightened and he cannot enlighten other people. So it’s a myth. And he has to adhere to that myth with such glue-like dynamism that created a great barrier between him and the reality. 

The reality is very different from what we feel today as human being. For example, I will tell you that Gavin came to me, 6, 7 years ago or more than that.

And first he got his realization I told him. He started to feel this cool breeze. He said, Mother how are we going to know that it has got telecommunication. I said all right, what do you want to find out. He said I want to find out about my father. 

I said all right, you put out your hands and just ask how is my father. He asked this question, immediately he started getting the burning on his hand right here. Now, these are the centers of your father. These are the centers of your mother. When he started getting the burning here, he said, Mother what is this? 

I said it means you father is down with very bad conditions. I said why don’t you telephone to him and find out? It is very easy to find out. And when he telephoned, he found out, his mother told, that your father is down.

That is how the information comes to us from this all pervading power.

Now before that, whatever we do, say, we talk about capitalism, we talk about communism. I would say I am the biggest capitalist, because I have all the power within my control. And I am the biggest communist, because I cannot live without sharing. Otherwise I cannot enjoy all the powers that I have.

I really cannot enjoy My own life, unless and until I share with all of you. 

I have lots of joy within myself. unless and until I share it with all of you, I cannot enjoy it. So I am communist.

The capitalism, communism, democracy are nothing, but the mix of reality.

Like, sometimes you say I am my nose, I am my eyes, I am my ears. They are all one.

You don’t see the integrated, Why? because you haven’t yet awakened yourself.

Once you are awakened, you know, I am the whole body. All this whole body has these different parts. But none of them have to be really perfect. So there must be some way where all these things integrated.

And they integrate at the point when you become the spirit.

Because the spirit is the thing within you that makes you a collective being.

Now my husband is working here at a Maritime organisation, and he has found whatever they were doing,

at the global level, international level, there are something, in human beings, because they rationally do them, they understand. That the whole world is the same, that you are my brother, I am your sister this sort of things. But in their hearts, still something lacking. 

Because the heart and the head are not integrated, we believed in so many things.

But the heart and the brain, they are not integrated.

How do you find, that a person who is believing into something, but is not doing that.

Because they are not integrated. When your heart and brain are absolutely integrated, then you do what you believe into. And you believe into something that you do.

Both things get hand in hand. That’s how these things that we feel look so funny. 

They say they believe, this is how we feel, and do all kinds of drama, and then we found they have no feels about it.

But I would not blame them, because they haven’t found their spirit, which integrates you completely.

Now it is the time you get your complete integration.

Now coming to absolute mundane level of thing. The other day, a gentleman of the radio came to interview me. He said all right, now would you tell me physical, emotional, and mental problems can be solved. It’s true. We have cured cancer. A lady from America, she has cured blood cancer. Of course it’s true, it can be cured. With the help of kundalini, you can cure all these diseases. Heart troubles, all this can be cured. 

Mentally also many mad people have become saint people, many addicts and all sorts of things have become all right. No doubt. 

It can be done. But you have to first of all get your realization. Without that, without that first step, nothing can be achieved. First step is that you get your light. Now some people think that we should work very hard, we should cleanse ourselves, we should do this and we should do that and then we should take realization. But what’s the point? Unless and until you get out of yourself, you cannot cleanse yourself.

You cannot see yourself, and you cannot understand, because you are so identified. For example, if you correct somebody: you have your ego. He will punch you at the nose: what do you mean by that? what do you mean I have an ego. You are the one who have the ego, what do you mean by saying me having ego. But when you get your realization, when the kundalini rises, here at this point, behind it on the optic chiasma there is a very subtle center called Agnya chakra. On this center resides our Lord Jesus Christ. And He sucks it, your ego and superego. When your attention is there, you can see your ego bloating up like a balloon. So you say, oh God this is me? All right. Nobody minds that, if you tell them their agnya chakra is catching. Nobody minds, because they don’t like it. They want to have this vibrations flowing into.

Then there can be a person with a super ego. A person who is always frightened, who always keep quiet, goes into some sort of alcoholism. Shun the society. There could be person like that. Such a person also, when he sees the light within himself, he becomes normal. Sahaja Yoga is there to normalise you completely. It makes you a normal person. 

But coming to the absolutely mundane thing like this gentleman asked me a question.

Then what about our unemployment in England?

What is the solution you give for our unemployment if through Sahaja Yoga?

I said, that is great, employment for you? Isn’t it? He said how?

I said Let’s see, how you get employed. Let’s be very practical about it.

You have over developed people. You have got your railways done, aeroplanes done. All kinds of machineries you have finished with. You have got everything. Now you become very comfortable, sitting here you can move everybody’s nose and eyes, and everything, you don’t have to move out of it. You can even destroy the whole world sitting down here. You don’t have to do anything. You have reached that state where you must rest. You have had too much, so as a holiday, you are resting. That’s how you are unemployed.

But in the subtle way, it is a divine’s working. How? Science and all these powers have been given to us, exposed to us because we have to finish our day-to-day work and save time. We are having problem, wearing watches. I don’t think my grandmother wore any watches on her arm. Nor could have been yours also. That time nobody bothered about time. Time was passing, nobody bothered about it. Now we are all the time, save the time, save the time. But save for what?

Save for the pub, or save for the ballroom dance, or for the quarrelling, or talking ill of others?

Save for your meditation, save for your ascent. The time you saved, have brought so many seekers of truth.

Now this is the time you have got, such a lot of spare time to you. Why this spare time has been accorded to you, is to ascent. Now you have been employed for worldly things, materialistic things and all that.

Now you have to be employed by God. You have to seek His employment. Once you got your realization, I first said all Sahaja Yogis must seek some jobs. They should not be unemployed. But just to make you normal, I told them.

But they are so employed now, they have no time, they are so busy. They are giving realization to people. They are curing people, they are going out, telling them about the method. They are so busy, they are doing the God’s work.

You are no more employed with the government, not employed by any private company, but you are employed by God. You are free, you are getting your food all right, your pension all right. Now you work. I have seen people 80 years old, 90 years old, doing God’s work.

From India, recently I went to America, a gentleman who is about 76 years of age, came down with me from India all the way. And he said now I am doing God’s work, so I am not at all tired, I am not at all afraid. He and his wife both came to Los Angeles to help me in programs.

So now the new employment has to start, that’s the employment of God.

You can meet the Sahaja Yogis and ask them. They are very busy people, they have no time.

Now my grandchildren who are here, they are also born realized. They are very enlightened people.

And they are very busy, they have no time for anything. Since we have come here, they have been very busy, going down, and trying to wind up people, 

We went to the airport one day, and this girl, she was doing like this, very fast, like a machine was on. So her mother asked what are you doing? She said I am trying to tide the whole airport. And this action works out.

Because the hands are flowing the divine power. So this action has a meaning. And she was work it out like that. She said all these people, they are so speedy, they are running fast for nothing at all. 

They are all the time busy. They do something here and there, trying to correct.

So the new employment one has to take. But the first of all, the first criteria of this employment is to become the spirit.

If you are not the spirit, you cannot.

So you become the spirit, then you must understand the methods of how to use this divine power. 

That’s all, it’s so simple. But one should not go on thinking about it. Because it is beyond thinking.

By thinking you have done all this. But now you have entered the realm of God, to be the citizen of God, in which you got powers. Then you really feel your generosity.

Your forgiving powers, which are so satisfying.

All the great powers will start fill in, once you become the spirit. That is very important to become the spirit. Now of course, you can say, there are many who talk like this. How to make out a person who is real and who is unreal.

First of all, it is a living happening. It is a happening in your evolutionary process. As you have become human being, you have to become a higher human being.

You are still in transition. You do not know why you are here. You do not have the meaning. That’s why you are frustrated.

So this has to happen in all of you. Now for this, everybody can say all right, I have to experience it.

The other day, one guy told me a gentleman came and gave us experience. I said, what kind of experience he gave you?

He said we became dumbfounded.

I said what is there to be dumbfounded? Supposing you go to a pub and have a big drink you can become dumbfounded. Experience is not the thing. It is the awareness. What happens. It’s the awareness that is the point.

Is your awareness is enlightened? Has your awareness got the new dimension which has got the collective consciousness.

Are you collectively conscious. Ask this simple question to yourself.

It is very easy to scan out these people, because everything they do is for money, for women, or something that is very very low level. I mean, everybody is trying to do something, is nothing but money, buildings, which are not important.

In the realm of God, what is important is joy, peace, is love. When we can achieve that spirit, then only we can talk about it. Before that, if I tell you a big story, what is the use? It has to happen, it has to work out. It’s your own right to become. You cannot sell it in the market, because it is a living process.

For example, supposing there is a seed which as to grow, sprout, and it’s a living process. Can you pay money to the seed, now you grow? Or a flower, which has to become the fruit, can you pay money to the flower, all right, come along, become a fruit? It’s as simple as that. All this living things are done by this living power. We have become human beings through the grace of this all pervading power. Even you have to become higher beings, through that. 

Sahaja means born with you. Also it means it is simple, spontaneous. Everything living is spontaneous. That’s why you cannot pay for it. You cannot sell it in the market. It has nothing to do with money.

God doesn’t understand money. He never saw money. He doesn’t know what it is you human beings have created, this money, this poverty, this richness. He has nothing to do with it.

He has created a beautiful world, a beautiful place for us to live. 

He has created you to enjoy it. But if you have made complications and you are so complicated. It’s better you get out of it and become a simple personality. 

To become a simple personality, also you have to get to that level, which is the spirit. 

And that is what Sahaja yoga is. As Gavin has told you.

You have to put your hand towards me.

I must say, I must confess that’s my job. I have to accept it. But it should not in any way hurt your ego. Because the other day somebody told me, why you Mother? I said: please come along, I will be very happy.

If you can do it, I will be very happy. I have a good family, good husband, I have my children, my grandchildren. 

They are happy people. Actually yesterday he was not well, so he didn’t want me to come here. I said I must go to this place. Definitely I must go, and I managed to come here. 

He also realises how important it is to transform people. But it is my job, what can I do?

You see, if it is my job, don’t crucify me for that. I have been asked to do the job, and I am doing it, in my own humble way.

Just to give you something, I have nothing to take from you. I am standing here where I cannot take anything. I can just give you my love, and you should accept it. 

Is there any harm in accepting somebody’s love? 

But once you get your realization, once you are enlightened. You can enlighten other people. Like one enlightened candle can enlighten another candle.

When that person is enlightened, he can enlighten another person.

It’s simple as that. I was born as an enlightened personality. And I was aware of it.

And then my father told me, very frankly, now you find out the method by which you can give en masse realization. Because otherwise if you speak, it will become another Bible, and they will fight; you will get another Judaism, and they will fight. It will be another Islam and they will fight. It’s better that you give them realization. Because somebody is born on the tenth storey.

He talks about the tenth storey, and people on the ground, first they are jealous, or they are angry, or they think the man is mad. They will do all kinds of thing, crucification, poisoning, torturing the saints, and all that.

He said nothing of the kind. First of all, make them realize there is two storey or three storey.
Let them feel that there is something beyond.

Once they start feeling there is something beyond, then they have to achieve it in their awareness.

Then only they will understand that there is more they need to be. Blind faith is no use.

In the same way, denying God is also no use. You must see and witness this happening, and once you become the self, you will understand God. Before becoming the self, you cannot understand God, that’s why even Buddha didn’t talk about God. He said better not talk about God. 

Once you talk about God, again hypocrisy starts. So he said let’s talk about self-realization.

Once you get self-realization, then I talk about God. But you know, he didn’t live that long. Actually in his life time, people gave realization to many people. 

Luckily I am in England. It’s all arranged, I think. I have to be here because this will become the new Jerusalem. And I’ve been struggling with English people, but I had six people with me for four years, you won’t believe. But they were managed. They are now the foundation of Sahaja Yoga in England.

English people are wise people. They are scholarly people. They don’t rush to conclusions. They are sensible people.

But a kind of inertia is settled because of the experiences of the past. Experiences of the religious people, experiences of the fake gurus, experiences of other that have done. And they are really now fed up and decided now we are not going to do anything.

But supposing you are seeking. And ultimately find it.

Won’t you ask for it? Because you are seeking for that only. Why not come to it and do it? 

No use of identifying yourself with something, with some organization, with some cult, with some misguided religion, or religious behaviours.

Best is to be yourself, and then you will be surprised that your hands will speak.

You yourself will know who is the real who is not real.

There is one draw back that people feel that if you start jumping, you are blessed by Holy Ghost.

If you start talking something non-sensical, you are being blessed by Holy Ghost.

How can that be? We can always jump. It is not difficult. Is it difficult to jump? Anybody can start jumping, everybody can start saying something like that. This misunderstanding has come, because 
Saint Paul I think said something, which he should not have said, because he is not realised soul, and he has no business to say that the Holy Ghost makes them jump. Actually this is done by the spirits.

People can mesmerise you and can make you jump. They can mesmerise. We have seen so many cases where masses mesmerise has taken place, to become the slaves of these people, to give them money, 
to give them Rolls Royces, to give them all kinds of useless thing.

So we must understand that this happening is a living happening. You cannot pull out your kundalini like that, you cannot pull out the germinating seedling from the seed. You cannot pull it out: come along, now you grow. 

It has to grow by itself. In the same way, the awakening of the kundalini, so many people have seen, if you come to my program later on, you will be able to see. The procession of the kundalini. You can see the procession of kundalini rising. You can feel it at the fontanel bone area, and once this opens out, you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head. You can feel the cool breeze coming out, and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hand.

Now this you cannot, no one can do it. 

And then once you get it, if you start practicing, you will be amazed. Because supposing if I have powers, or if I have money, and I don’t know how to spend it. I don’t know what the money is, what this paper mean, what’s the use? 

In the same way, when you get it, you have to give it to others. You have to look after others. You have to impart this beautiful thing. In doing that, you do not get into any trouble, you do not suffer from anything.

On the contrary, you feel so relieved. And there is fulfilment, some meaning to our lives. Something that we are doing, which is so substantial, so living, you are doing your work of God. 

May God bless you all.

It is such a big subject, and in a short time, I cannot explain every aspect of it.

It is a very very wide thing. But now I can only say that there are 600, 700 lectures I have given, only in England.

Still they say, Mother, you say something new. I just don’t understand. But whatever it is, knowledge by words is of no use. Knowledge should be your own, which should come to you as light. 

For example, if you do any work, just by subtle entering into it, or penetrating into it, so best thing is to become the knowledge, instead of just knowing it and understanding it, which you can do it. You are quite capable of doing it, and it can happen to all of you.

I wish this evening especially it will happen. 

They say it is a small village. And to me, small or big doesn’t matter. How many are there genuine seekers who are genuinely seeking God, seeking their spirit? That’s the most important thing for me. Even there is one person like that, I go to that place. Whether it’s one house, or one village, or a big city, makes no difference to me.

May God Bless you.
