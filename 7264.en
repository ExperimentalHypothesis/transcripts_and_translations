All That is Vital is Extremely Simple, Public Programme, Mytholmroyd, Yorkshire (UK), 30 July 1982.

I think some of the Sahaja Yogis were rather amazed that I accepted Rita’s invitation to come to this place! Rita has been very kind to call me here.

Every place has its own attractions, as far as the Divine is concerned.

And I knew there must be some very deep seekers in this place who could be really benefited if I could visit this place. And I was overjoyed to arrive here.

Now the question about Sahaja Yoga is very simple to understand. All that is vital is extremely simple. For example the way we breathe is so simple. We don’t read any book, we don't do any exercise for that. We don’t have to go and learn from anyone, we just do it. In the same way, if our seeking has some meaning and if we have to find out something it must be the most vital thing offered. It’s not just an alternative life. Many people have a feeling that the seekers are nothing but they are finding alternative theories, and to alternate, with the present norms and conditions - it’s not so.

The time, that is today, the modern times, are special times described in the ancient scriptures in India and also in The Bible and Koran. In all the scriptures they are described. In the Koran they are described as the resurrection time. Christ has many a time talked about it that: you have to know My Father forever. That your hands will speak. Lots of descriptions he has given of this state which you will achieve at a time. As in life you have seen [that] a tree has to grow. First it may have just one or two flowers but when time comes when the same tree which has only one or two flowers - about, say, two years back [or] three years back - suddenly gets into a blossom time and has lots of flowers. Like that, today is the time of blossom time of all the seekers.

So many seekers have taken birth today on this Earth. Especially England it’s described by William Blake that these times are going to come when England is going to become Jerusalem. ‘Jerusalem’ means ‘where it will be pilgrimage.’ For people will think this is the Holy Land of God. That people will come to this Holy Land, to visit this place. So the people have to be holy, they have to. It’s not the trees that are going to become holy, it is not the land that is going to be holy but it’s the people. Their hearts are going to be holy.

Then how do they become holy? What happen to a person when he really becomes holy? We talk of saints. We talk of prophets. What is the difference between these revered people and ordinary people? There’s only one difference. The difference is this: that in their attention, in their central nervous system, there is the light of their Spirit. While for the other people, they live in ignorance without this light of the Spirit.

The Spirit exists in every one of us. It is always there, present, all the time. It’s Omnipresent. It’s all the time present within us. But the problem is that we are not aware of it, that it is not shining in our attention, in our awareness.

When Gavin told you about the new awareness it means that the awareness that we have, the human awareness, becomes enlightened - a new awareness - and in that awareness what happens is that our Spirit manifests.

Now one may say, Mother it must be a difficult thing. People have to do so many tapasya, they have to do so much penance and they have to go to Himalayas and do all kinds of things, stand on their heads for days together, and how is it that it is working so easily now?

Actually that kind of thing is not needed today because the time has come.

When the time has come it just work out fast, it works out en masse. Now I am with you here but in India, those people who have visited with me know that there are thousands of people for every programme I go [to] there. And all of them get realisation. All of them get realisation. Means they started feeling the All-pervading Power for the first time on their hands. “Your hands will speak.” First time the All-pervading Power about which Christ has described, every scripture has described, you start to feel it as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

Now this feeling, somebody can say, “Could be due to this, could be due to that,” because we are doubting Thomases sometimes and we start doubting it. But the thing is, you can see, in so many people, the rising of the power from the triangular bone which is called as ‘Sacrum’. Surprisingly ‘sacrum’ means ‘sacred’. That means that Greeks knew that it is a sacred bone, it’s a sacred bone. Nowadays this word has no meaning but it will come back when people realise what is sacred.

In this bone, the triangular bone, we have this power called Kundalini settled down. This residual power which creates us, which creates the whole being, is still not manifested, it is still sleeping. Because it is the power of our desire which is the ultimate desire to become one with the Spirit, to feel the All-pervading Power, to be the instrument of the God.

Until this power, or we can say this power of desire has manifested itself, we are not going to be happy people. We can try anything we like [but we will not].

Now, in the beginning you may say, that so many prophets came in: Christ came in, all of them came just to make us ready for this day when we can be born again. Christ has clearly said you have to be born again. Now who is bothered about it? There are people I have met who have certified themselves “born again,” but you can’t certify yourself as “born again”. “Born again” means a person who has felt this All-pervading Power. Who can make this All-pervading Power flow through his being and can manoeuvre it and understand it.

Now this All-pervading Power is the power that has all the powers that you see: all this electricity, everything is a part of that power. That’s the vitality of the whole Universe, that has created this Universe. This All-pervading Power that flows when you get your realisation, gives you tremendous powers. But the biggest power it gives you is to love. God is love, and His power is the power of love. He really loves us. He loves us so much that He is the one who wants to save us. It is He who is anxious to save His creation. He doesn’t want that His creation which He has created with such love with such attention, with such delicate help, out of which you are the epitome of His creation. The human beings are the highest, and [for them] to be destroyed - that He cannot bear. And it is His desire that is flowering today as Sahaja Yoga and that the people are getting Self-realisation in such a mass quantities.

But the main problem today is that there are so many in the market that people don’t know what to do. To begin with, we have churches, we have mosques, we have temples, we have all kinds of people selling God, or maybe talking about God, or saying that, “This is God.”

Now these religions came on this Earth, all the Prophets came on this Earth, to establish a balance within us, as I told you, to prepare us for the ultimate. But I have noticed that without enlightenment whatever is the belief, whether it is Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism, all any isms or Communism or Capitalism or any sort of thing, it is fanatic belief.

The reason is without the light, you can not see.

For example, I come upon this table, I feel this table [when] there is no light [in the room]. To me this table is the main thing, the rest doesn’t exist. To another person comes here and sees a chair, to him this chair, nothing [else] exists. Now this myth that he believes into, he has to establish it. It’s a myth because he’s not yet enlightened and he cannot enlighten other people so it’s a myth. And he has to adhere to that myth with such glue-like tenacity that created a great barrier between him and the Truth. Because he has not known the Reality yet. Reality is very different from what we feel today as human beings.

For example, I will tell you that this Gavin (Brown) who has today spoke to, met me about six, seven years back or we should say more than that.

And first he got his realisation I told him, “This is All-pervading Power. ” He started feeling the Cool Breeze. He said, “Mother how are we to know that it has got telecommunication, it has every way of informing us?” I said, “Alright, what do you want to find out?” He said, “I want to find out about my father.” I said, “Alright, you put your hands and just ask ‘how is my father?’.” And he asked this question: immediately he started getting the burning on his hand, on here. Now, these are the centres of your father. These are the centres of your mother. When he started getting the burning here, he said, “Mother what is this?” I said it means you father is down with very bad bronchitis. His father was in Scotland. I said, “Why don’t you telephone to him and find out? It’s very easy to find out.” And when he telephoned, he found out, his mother told, that, “Your father is down with very bad bronchitis.” So that is how the information comes to us from this All-pervading Power.

Now before that, whatever we do, say we talk of capitalism, we talk of communism. I would say I am the greatest capitalist because I have all my powers within my control. I have all my powers within my control And I am the greatest communist because I cannot live without sharing. I have to share them because otherwise I cannot enjoy all those powers that I have.

I really cannot enjoy my own life unless and until I share it with all of you.

I have lots of joy within myself but unless and until I share my joy with you all, I am not going to enjoy it. So I am a regular communist. So all these things you have done, like communism, capitalism, communism, democracy are nothing but the myths of  the Reality. Like, sometimes you say, “I am my nose, I am my ears, I am my eyes.” They are all one!

You do not see the integration. Why? Because you haven’t yet awakened yourself.

Once you are awakened you find “Oh! I am the whole body.” All this whole body has all these different parts which we consider, “This is good, that is good,” but none of them have proved to be really perfect. They are good, but they are not that good. So there must be some way where all these things integrate, and they integrate at a point where you become the Spirit because Spirit is the thing within you which is the Collective Being.

Now my husband, as you know, is at the UN system and you have an agency here called the ‘Maritime Organisation’. And he also feels that, whatever they are doing on a global level, on an international level lacks something, lacks something, in human beings. Because rationally they understand that the whole world is the same, that you are my brother and I am your sister this sort of things but in their hearts there is still something lurking because the heart and the head are not integrated. We believe into so many things but the heart and the brain, they are not integrated.

How do you find, that the person who is believing into something but is not doing that? Because they are not integrated. When the heart and brain both are absolutely integrated then you do what you believe into, and [if] you believe into something, then you do that. Both things go hand in hand, and that’s how these things that we feel look so funny with people. They talk so big! They say they, “We’ll do this for you,” and, “This is what we feel,” They make all kinds of drama. And ultimately you find they have no feels about it. But I do not blame them because they haven’t found their Spirit, which integrates you completely. And this is the time when you will get your complete integration in life.

Now coming to absolute mundane level of things: the other day, a gentleman of the radio came to interview me and he said, “Alright. You tell tell me that physical, emotional and also mental problems can be solved through Sahaja Yoga.” It’s true. We have cured cancer.  There is one girl today, who came today from America. She has cured a blood cancer [case]. Of course it’s true. It can be cured. With this happening, with the awakening of Kundalini you can cure all these diseases. Heart troubles, all these can be cured. Then mentally also: many mad people have become sane people. Many addicts and all sorts of things have become alright. No doubt! It can be done. But you have to first of all get your realisation.  Without that, without that first step, nothing can be achieved.

First step is that you get your light in. Now some people think that we should work very hard and we should cleanse ourselves, we should do this and we should do that and then we should take realisation. But why?

Unless and until you get out of yourself you cannot cleanse yourself, you cannot see yourself, and you cannot understand because you are so identified. For example, if you correct somebody, “You have got ego.” He’ll just punch you on your nose and say, “What do you mean by such a thing? What do you mean, ‘You have an ego’? You are the one who has the ego! What do you mean by saying such a thing to me that ‘You have an ego’?”

But when you get your realisation, when the Kundalini rises, here at this point, where you see this red mark, behind it, on the optic chiasma there’s a very subtle centre called Agya chakra. On this centre resides our Lord Jesus Christ. And He sucks in your ego and superego. And when your attention is there, you can see your ego bloating up like a balloon. You see it and you say, “Oh God! This is me? Alright.” Nobody minds then if you tell them that, “Your Agya chakra is catching.” Nobody minds it. Because they don’t like it [to be catching]. They want to have these vibrations flowing into you.

Then there can be a person with a superego. A person who is always frightened, who has fear and who always keeps quiet and goes into some sort of alcoholism or something, shuns the society. There could be person like that. Such a person, also, when he sees light within himself he becomes normal. Sahaja Yoga is there to normalise you completely, to make you a normal person.

But coming to the absolutely mundane thing like this gentleman asked me a question that, “What about our unemployment in England? What do you say? What is the solution you give for our unemployment if through Sahaja Yoga?” I said, “That’s a very great employment for you?” He said, “How?” I said, “Let’s see how you got employed. Let us be very practical about it.” You are over developed people. You have got your railways done, you have got your aeroplanes done, all kinds of machineries you have finished with. I mean, you have done everything and to add to it now you have computers! Sitting down here you can move everybody’s nose and eyes and everything, you don’t have to move out of here. You can even destroy the whole world sitting down here. You don’t have to do anything.

So you have reached that state where, now, you must rest. You have had too much development. So, as a holiday, now you are resting. And that’s how you are unemployed. But, in the subtle way, it is a Divine’s working. How? Science and all these powers have been given to us, exposed to us because we have to finish our every day-to-day work and save time. We have been wearing watches. I don’t think my grandmother wore any watch all her life. Nor could have been yours also. That time nobody bothered about time. Time was passing, nobody bothered about that. But now we are all the time, “Save the time, save the time, save the time.” But save for what? Save for the pub, or save for the ballroom dancing, or for the quarrelling, or for hitting others or talking ill of others? Save for yourself. Save for your meditation. Save for your ascent. And this saving itself, the time that you have saved, has brought in the birth of so many seekers on this Earth.

Now this is the time [that] you have got such a lot of spare time to you. Why this spare time has been awarded to you? Is to ascend. Now you have been employed for worldly things and worldly materialistic things and all that but now you are to be employed by God. You have to seek His employment. Once you get your realisation, now we have Sahaja Yogis, first I first said all Sahaja Yogis must seek some jobs. They should not be unemployed. But just to make it look normal I told that. But they are so employed now, they have no time, they are so busy. They are giving realisation to people, they are curing people, they are going round telling them about the message. They are so busy, they are doing God’s work.

Now you are no more employed with the government. You are not employed by any private companies, but you are employed by God. So, you are free, you are getting your food alright, you are getting your pensions alright. Now you work. I have seen people who are even eighty years old, ninety years old [that] are doing God’s work. From India, recently when I went to America, a gentleman who is about seventy-six years of age came down to get me from India, all the way. And he said, “Now I am doing God’s work, so I am not at all tired, I am not at all afraid.” He and his wife, both of them, came to Los Angeles to help me down there.

So now the new employment has to start and that is the employment of God.

You can meet the Sahaja Yogis and ask them. They are very busy people. They have no time.

Now my grandchildren who are here, they are also born-realised people, they are very enlightened people. And they are very busy. They have no time for anything. You see, since we have come here they have been busy going round and trying to see wider people. Now, we went to the airport one day, and this girl was tying up like this, very fast, she was doing like this, very fast, like a machine was on. So her mother asked, “What are you doing?” She said, “I’m trying to tie up the whole of airport.  You see, they are running helter-skelter they are all getting mad!” And this action works out because the hands are flowing [with] that Divine Power. So this action has a meaning. And she was working it out like that and she was going on, and she said, “I have to tie up all these people, they are so speedy, so crazy, they are running fast for nothing at all.” And she was just trying to do that. They are all the time busy. [If] you talk to them, “No I’m just I’m busy!” They will do something here and there and they try to correct it.

So the new employment one has to take. But the first of all, the first criteria of this new employment is that you should become the Spirit. If you are not the Spirit, you cannot do it. So you become the Spirit. Then you must learn the methods of how to use this Divine Power, how should it be done.

That’s all! It’s so simple. It’s all made for you. It’s very easy. Nothing to work out. But one should not go on thinking about it. Because it is beyond thought. By thinking you have built up all these things, by planning you have done all this. But now you have to enter into the Realm of God, to be the citizen of God Empire where he gives you powers by which you work out the world. But the whole. And then you really feel your generosity and your giving powers which are so great, your forgiving powers, which are so satisfying. All the great powers will start feeling once you become that Spirit. And that is very important, to become the Spirit.

Now of course, you can say, there are many who talk like this. They have to! They have to talk like this, but there are ways of understanding how to make out a person who is real and who is unreal.

First of all, it is a living happening. It’s the happening in your evolutionary process. As you have become human being you have to become a higher being. You are still in transition. You do not know why you are here. You don’t know your meaning, that’s why you are frustrated, that’s why you are unhappy. So this has to happen to all of us.

Now for this, everybody can say, “Alright, I’ll give you an experience.”

The other day one girl told me that a gentleman came and told us, “I’ll give you an experience.” And what experience did he give? She said, “We became dumbfounded.” I said, “What is there [so special] to be dumbfounded?” Supposing you go to a pub and have a big drink you can be dumbfounded! What’s so valuable [in that]? What is an experience? Supposing you are pricked you might get the experience of pain or something. Experience is not the thing, it’s the awareness. What happens to your awareness is the point. Is your awareness is enlightened? Has your awareness got the new dimension by which you understand other people, the collectively consciousness? Did you become collective? Are you collectively conscious? Ask this simple question to yourself.

But it’s very easy to scan out these people because everything they do is for money or for women, or something very, very low level thing. I mean, everybody who is trying to do something is nothing but money or buildings or all these things which are not important.

In the realm of God, what is important is the joy, is the peace, is the love. And when we can achieve that Spirit then only we can talk about it. Before that, if I tell you a big story, what’s the use? It has to happen, it has to work out. It’s your own right to get it. You cannot sell it in the market because it’s a living process. For example, supposing there’s a seed which has to grow, sprout, and it’s a living process, can we pay money to the seed? “Now you please grow?” Or a flower which has to become the fruit, can you pay money to the flower? “Alright, come along now, become a fruit!” Will it become? It’s as simple as that.

All these living things are done by this All-pervading Power. We have become human beings also through the grace of this All-pervading Power. Even you have to become higher beings it will be through that.

‘Sahaja’ means ‘born with you’. Also it means it’s ‘simple’, ‘spontaneous’. Everything living is spontaneous and that’s why you cannot pay for it, you cannot sell it in the market. It has nothing to do with money.

God doesn’t understand money. He never saw money. He doesn’t know what it is you human beings have created, this money, this poverty, this richness. He has nothing to do with it. He has created a beautiful world, a beautiful place for all of you live and He has created you to enjoy it. But if you have made complications and hangs-up and you are so complicated it’s better to get out of it and become a simple personality. To become a simple personality also you have to get to that level which is the Spirit.

And that is what Sahaja yoga is today.

As Gavin has told you that you have to put hands towards me.

Now I must say, I must confess that that’s my job. I have to accept it. But it should not in any way hurt your ego. Because the other day somebody told me, “Why you Mother?” I said, “Please come along! I’ll be very happy.

If you can do it nothing like it! I’ll be very happy. Now see, I have a good family, a very good husband, my family, my children, my grandchildren and they are happy people. Actually yesterday he was not well also so much and he didn’t want me to come here but I said, “No I must go to this place. It’s definite I must go.” And I managed to come here. And he also realises how important it is to transform people. But it’s my job what can I do? You see, if it is my job are you going to crucify me for that? I have been really asked to do this job and I am doing it in my own humble way just to give you something. I have to just give you. I have nothing to take from you. I am standing at an end where I cannot take anything. I can just give you my love and you should just accept it. Is there any harm in accepting somebody’s love? Which you cannot pay for.

But once you get realisation, once you are enlightened, you can enlighten other people. Like one light which is enlightened can enlighten another person and when that person is enlightened, can enlighten another person.

It’s simple as that. I was born as an enlightened personality. And I was aware of it. And then my father told me, very frankly that, now you find out a method by which you can give a en-masse realisation. Because otherwise if you speak it will become another Bible, and people will fight; you will get another Judaism, and they will fight. It will be another Islam and they will fight. It’s better that you give them realisation. Because somebody is born on the tenth storey.

He talks about the tenth storey, and people on the ground, first they are jealous, or they are angry, or they think the man is mad. They will do all kinds of thing, crucification, poisoning, torturing the saints, and all that.

He said nothing of the kind. First of all, make them realise there is two storey or three storey.

Let them feel that there is something beyond.

Once they start feeling there is something beyond, then they have to achieve it in their awareness.

Then only they will understand that there is more they need to be. Blind faith is no use.

In the same way, denying God is also no use. You must see and witness this happening, and once you become the self, you will understand God. Before becoming the self, you cannot understand God, that’s why even Buddha didn’t talk about God. He said better not talk about God.

Once you talk about God, again hypocrisy starts. So he said let’s talk about self-realisation.

Once you get self-realisation, then I talk about God. But you know, he didn’t live that long. Actually in his life time, people gave realisation to many people.

Luckily I am in England. It’s all arranged, I think. I have to be here because this will become the new Jerusalem. And I’ve been struggling with English people, but I had six people with me for four years, you won’t believe. But they were managed. They are now the foundation of Sahaja Yoga in England.

English people are wise people. They are scholarly people. They don’t rush to conclusions. They are sensible people.

But a kind of inertia is settled because of the experiences of the past. Experiences of the religious people, experiences of the fake gurus, experiences of other that have done. And they are really now fed up and decided now we are not going to do anything.

But supposing you are seeking. And ultimately find it.

Won’t you ask for it? Because you are seeking for that only. Why not come to it and do it?

No use of identifying yourself with something, with some organisation, with some cult, with some misguided religion, or religious behaviours.

Best is to be yourself, and then you will be surprised that your hands will speak.

You yourself will know who is the real who is not real.

There is one draw back that people feel that if you start jumping, you are blessed by Holy Ghost.

If you start talking something non-sensical, you are being blessed by Holy Ghost.

How can that be? We can always jump. It is not difficult. Is it difficult to jump? Anybody can start jumping, everybody can start saying something like that. This misunderstanding has come, because

Saint Paul I think said something, which he should not have said, because he is not realised soul, and he has no business to say that the Holy Ghost makes them jump. Actually this is done by the Spirits.

People can mesmerise you and can make you jump. They can mesmerise. We have seen so many cases where masses mesmerise has taken place, to become the slaves of these people, to give them money,

to give them Rolls Royces, to give them all kinds of useless thing.

So we must understand that this happening is a living happening. You cannot pull out your Kundalini like that, you cannot pull out the germinating seedling from the seed. You cannot pull it out: come along, now you grow.

It has to grow by itself. In the same way, the awakening of the Kundalini, so many people have seen, if you come to my programme later on, you will be able to see. The procession of the Kundalini. You can see the procession of Kundalini rising. You can feel it at the fontanel bone area, and once this opens out, you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head. You can feel the cool breeze coming out, and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hand.

Now this you cannot, no one can do it.

And then once you get it, if you start practicing, you will be amazed. Because supposing if I have powers, or if I have money, and I don’t know how to spend it. I don’t know what the money is, what this paper mean, what’s the use?

In the same way, when you get it, you have to give it to others. You have to look after others. You have to impart this beautiful thing. In doing that, you do not get into any trouble, you do not suffer from anything.

On the contrary, you feel so relieved. And there is fulfilment, some meaning to our lives. Something that we are doing, which is so substantial, so living, you are doing your work of God.

May God bless you all.

It is such a big subject, and in a short time, I cannot explain every aspect of it.

It is a very very wide thing. But now I can only say that there are 600, 700 lectures I have given, only in England.

Still they say, Mother, you say something new. I just don’t understand. But whatever it is, knowledge by words is of no use. Knowledge should be your own, which should come to you as light.

For example, if you do any work, just by subtle entering into it, or penetrating into it, so best thing is to become the knowledge, instead of just knowing it and understanding it, which you can do it. You are quite capable of doing it, and it can happen to all of you.

I wish this evening especially it will happen.

They say it is a small village. And to me, small or big doesn’t matter. How many are there genuine seekers who are genuinely seeking God, seeking their Spirit? That’s the most important thing for me. Even there is one person like that, I go to that place. Whether it’s one house, or one village, or a big city, makes no difference to me.

May God Bless you.
