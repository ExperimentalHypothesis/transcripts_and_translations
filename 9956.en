I bow to all the seekers of truth.

Truth is love and love is truth. If you love someone then you know all about that person. But when it is divine love then you know the essence of every person. There is within us, as you know, there is a power which is called as a kundalini which can connect you to this all-pervading power of God's love.

We see these beautiful flowers here and they have come out of one single seed but we take them for granted. Who does this living work? Who has made the human beings from amoeba stage? There is a power beyond us which has done this work without needing anything about it. For all this living process we don't pay anything.

Now we've reached a state of the human being and there is little breakthrough more that is needed for you to feel this love of God. All the scriptures have said it that you are to be born again, all scriptures. But none of them tried to get that experience of being born again. And they organized themselves, made money and did not think that spiritual life is beyond human awareness. They just became book worms. Whatever is written in the book has to become. It is [like], supposing you have a headache and a medicine is written by a doctor. If you go on reading the name of the medicine will you get rid of your headache? By reading books how can you evolve?

So the reality is that you have to become the Spirit, the Spirit which is your reality. And when you become the reality then you know that there is this all-pervading Power. You do not know mentally your emotion but you know actually, on your fingertips you can feel this all-pervading Power as cool breeze, a very gentle, cool, soothing breeze flowing on your fingertips. This you have not felt before but when you feel it you will be amazed how much power you get yourself. For example, this instrument [the mike] has to be connected to the mains otherwise it has no meaning at all. That is how you are to be connected to this divine power of love.

Then you start a new life of transformation. First your health improves. You know there are people who met me from Tolyatti and they told that many ladies who were not having children have now conceived; they are going to have children. Also people have given up alcohol and also given up smoking, all of it. So it happens spontaneously. I don't have to tell you, "Don't do this, don't do that." Mentally you become a balanced personality and also you have discretion, divine discretion, to know who is your friend and who is not your friend, who is really a spiritual person and who is not because you know the absolute truth. Because the Spirit is the source of absolute truth so you get the knowledge on your central nervous system, on your nerves. In Sanskrit it's called as "bodha" from where the word "buddha" has come - means to know on your central nervous system, not mentally. Also the word "vida" which is from "Vedas", vida also means that.

This is your own power which works it out because kundalini is your own mother, individual mother. I don't know why in the Bible they did not write about Christ's mother as the Goddess. But the people of those days who were following some other religion started calling her "Madonna" and it's fact - she is - but there is no proof. Only after realisation you will know who she was, who was Christ.

So these problems, all human problems are really coming because there is something wrong with human beings. But once they are transformed, they become the Spirit then all these problems are solved because the Spirit is the collective being within us. It is the reflection of God Almighty in all of us. We have divinity within ourselves and that is just to be felt. The Spirit is collective being and that's how we realize that we have become part and parcel of the whole: as the microcosm becomes the microcosm, like a drop becomes the ocean. This has to happen everywhere and it's happening in 55 countries.

It means your attention becomes extremely alert, intelligent and compassionate. As a result wherever you put your attention it works out in a proper direction. But above all you achieve your peace in the heart - no more tensions, no more worries. You actually jump into the ocean of joy. You start enjoying yourself. Human beings are the best thing that is created. You don't have to sacrifice anything, you don't have to give up anything. It’s just, you get it as a matter of fact.

You reach a state – means that you are blessed by God, your country is blessed and whole world is blessed. Many people tell me that, "Mother, we pray to God and there are no blessings." If you are not connected how can you get blessing? What's the use of telephoning if it is not connected? But if you use the telephone too much it might get spoiled. So the best thing is to get your connection and establishing the connection.

I wanted you to ask me some questions for about 15 minutes but today I have to catch a train back to Moscow. But I’ve not come here to take anything from you because you cannot give anything. But I have come here to give you the key of your joy and happiness. So please me ask questions which are relevant to this. Thank you very much.

Question: [UNCLEAR]

[Flowers offered]

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Spasibo.

And also with each flower you must forgive everyone, that's very important. *Prostite. It’s very important. (*Russian - forgive).

Question: At what age a child’s fontanel should close?

Shri Mataji: It all depends on every child but sooner the better. If it just open after 16 years time you must take precautions. Maximum at 2 years, maximum. But what you have to do is to put some oil, olive oil, on the fontanel and try to bring the oil back to the fontanel, fill it up with oil. But with Sahaja Yoga is much easier.

Alright? No questions - wonderful. Because I am very good at answering all questions.

Question: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: That's what I am going to do now. Very good question.

A seeker: We want to ask for forgiveness from Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Oh, you? I love you very much and it's no question of forgiving. I love you.

So we'll now have the session of Self-realisation. It should take 10-15 minutes.

But I am to make a humble request that those who do not want should leave the hall because I cannot force it on you. It cannot be forced. I respect your freedom because ultimately you have to get the complete freedom. So in the glory of your freedom you have to ask for Self-knowledge, Self-realisation. Self is respect.

But it is important that after getting your realisation, after feeling the cool breeze you must come and become collective with other people. Some people feel nice for some time and they get lost. Supposing my nail is cut out then it doesn't grow. Sahaja Yoga only works in the collective. Formerly people had to go to Himalayas and do all kind of penances to get them cleansed, give up their families, give up everyone, become ascetics. But in Sahaja Yoga with the collectivity you get cleansed. If you do not come to collectivity, you will be surprised after some time you might be again caught up.

We have to have now two leaders for you and they will all work it out; one for men, one for ladies. We’ll have two leaders and they’ll work out everything for you. Also we've got Dr. Bogdan from England who has come here, all the day, he is a great Russian, I must say. Also we’ve got Yogi Mahajan who is going to come here and work for you. There is Arun Kumar, so many people are here also from England. So now it is for you to care for your realisation and to respect it otherwise you will lose it. One should not have jealousies and small little ..., making groups and this that but should join all of you together. Try, watch yourself, introspect and see why can't you become one with the whole? And they will tell you how to make this connection permanent and perfect.

But to all the Russians I have to say one thing: that you must now take to work, very important. All your factories are lying without any work. I see people just not interested in work. In freedom one has to work. You got your freedom so easily. We got our freedom with great fight and sacrifice. If you want your freedom permanently then all the Sahaja Yogis must decide that they will do some work, they will not idle out. This is a vow all of you have to take after realisation.

First we'll tell you how to nourish your centers on the left side and then you have to close your eyes for the process of the kundalini awakening within you.

This is doctor Bogdan, give him a hand.

Now we have to first of all sit down in a comfortable manner, without bending forward or backward but in a stable way. And take out your shoes because this Mother Earth will help us. Then we have two powers - left and right which is used of sympathetic nervous system – so you have to just keep both the feet apart from each other.

Please put your left hand on your lap, because left side is the power of desire and this is symbolic to express your desire to have Self-realisation. And put the right hand on your heart. We nourish with the right hand because right side is the power of action. So this is heart where the Spirit resides. In the heart is reflected the Spirit. Then we take our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen which is the centre of your mastery. So if you become the Spirit in the light of the Spirit you become your own guide, your own master. So now we take down our right hand in the lower portion of our abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre of pure knowledge which works on your central nervous system and does all divine work. Then again we take our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen and then on our heart, now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. This centre you catch when you feel guilty. There is no need to feel guilty at all. Now take your right hand on top of your forehead across. Now slowly put your head downwards. Here you have to forgive everyone without thinking individually about them. Now take back your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to - without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction - you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power of love. You have to stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of your head, on the fontanel bone area and now take down your head as far as possible. Push back your fingers, this is important; push back your fingers and press your scalp. Put down your head and move the scalp clockwise seven times. Now, that's all we have to do.

At the very outset I’ve to tell you there are three conditions. The first is that you have to be absolutely confident that you'll get your realisation. The second one is that you have to forget your past and not to feel guilty at all. If you feel guilty then this centre catches very badly, on the left hand side, and you get diseases like angina, like spondylitis and diseases due to lethargic organs.

The third condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Whether you forgive or you don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and then you suffer while the people who have troubled you are quite happy. Please don't say it’s difficult. It is just a mental idea. Don't even think about them. Just in general if you say, "I forgive everyone of them", you will feel so much lighter.

Now you have to put your left hand towards me like this, comfortably on your lap, and put both the feet apart from each other. Those who are sitting on the ground are alright like they are. And then you have to put your right hand on your heart. Now you have to close your eyes - you can take out your spectacles - and please don't open them till I tell you.

So now please close your eyes. Now here you have to ask me a very fundamental question about you. You have to call me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji", whatever you like. Here you have to ask this question three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" in your heart.

Now you have to take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side because we are working on the left hand side. And as you become the Spirit you become your master. So please me ask again three time this question, with full confidence, "Mother, am I my own master?"

I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So you have to take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it hard and ask for pure knowledge by saying six times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." And this is six times because this centre has got six petals.

As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising so we have to nourish our centres with our full confidence. So please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, press it hard on the left hand side, and say with full confidence ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

At the very outset I’ve told you that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings but you are pure Spirit. So please raise your right hand onto your heart and please say 12 times with full confidence, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

This divine power is the power of love and compassion. This divine power is the ocean of pure knowledge. This divine power above all is the ocean of forgiveness so whatever you may do can be easily dissolved by this power of forgiveness. So please raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and here with full self-confidence you have to say, "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

I have already told you that whether you forgive or you don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. You don't have to play into wrong hands and torture yourself. So now you have to raise your right hand on your forehead across, bend your head as far as possible and here with full confidence you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." without thinking about individuals. It is not how many times but it’s from your heart.

Now you have to take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to - without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your own satisfaction - you have to say, not how many times but from your heart, "Oh, divine power, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes."

Now the last centre. Please spread your palm, stretch it fully and put the centre of your palm on the fontanel bone area. Now push back your fingers and put down your head as far as possible. Here again I cannot cross over your freedom. You have to ask for Self-realisation. So move your scalp seven times saying, "Mother, please give me Self-realisation."

Now please take down your hands and please open your eyes slowly. Now put both the hands towards me like Dr. Bogdan. And now see with your left hand like this and right hand, put down your head and see for yourself if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Please don't put your hand on your head but away from it. Sometimes you get it very far also.

Now please put the left hand towards me. And now put down your head again and see with your right hand. If you are feeling a hot [breeze] that means you have not forgiven. So please forgive.

Now put the right hand again and see with your left hand if there is a cool breeze coming out; bend your head and see for yourself.

Now please put both your hands up in the sky like this. Put your head upward like that and ask a question, anyone of these three questions, one of them ask three times. First is, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Second is, "Mother, is this the divine love?" Third is, "Mother, is this the paramchaitanya?" But ask anyone of these three times. Please put your hands.

Now please put your hands like this and watch me without thinking.

Those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands or hot breeze, or on their head, on their fingertips, please raise both your hands.

I bow to you all, to all of you saints. Please take down your hands. I bow to you. I bow to you. You all have started your saintly life. Now you must grow and respect it. You can feel each other also. You can feel the cool breeze from each others' heads. But all of you must become collective. That is very important otherwise you will not grow.

Thank you very much. Spasibo.

I am sorry I have to go for the train. And next time I’ll be here for more time. I will be in Russia for 15 days minimum.
