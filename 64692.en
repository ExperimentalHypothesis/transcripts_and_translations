Wedding Announcements, Ganapatipule, India, 24-12-1994

Shri Mataji: ...and under the circumstances, we can’t help it. If you put restrictions; of course, we observe the restrictions. But in that case, there’s a problem. So now we will start. Alright? Also, those people who were announced before – there were some girls were missing; some boys were missing. So also you can find out and try to match.

Yogi has been working very systematically. He is working very hard. And [unclear] all of them. But still, you must know that in such a short time to decide is very difficult.

Sahaja Yogi: Doctor Valentino.

[No audio. Starts again with wedding announcements by Sahaja Yogis].

Sahaja Yogis: Oleg Romankoff from Russia with Magnani Nirmala from Nasik.

They should stand up wherever they are. [applause]

Alexander Lickovich from Russia and M Nageshwari from Hyderabad. [applause]

M Yagneshwari from Hyderabad. [applause]

Kaushal Rai from Delhi with Edenva Noronnova from Slovakia.

[Names of couples are announced for the next ten minutes].

Shri Mataji: I think we have to start the music programme now. About these marriages, I will tell you later on. But we have found out that Russian girls are the best as housewives. Very satisfied. [applause]. They are not bothered as to how much you are earning, what you are doing. They are very satisfied and can live with two-three sarees. Very sweet girls. They are very good-looking. And also from other countries like Romania, Poland; they are very good girls.

I am surprised that Indian girls are very fussy. Some of them want to know how much is the pay of the husband, how much he can earn – very calculating. So we have avoided such marriages. Because you have to fight your life in Sahaja Yoga. So many of you who got married before too, didn’t have much money. But you had faith and everything worked out. So two extremes are there.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

I am surprised especially with Indian girls. They put on airs. If they have to put on airs, then they will remain here. And will not go there and dominate. Not at all. They are sinking our country’s name everywhere. You people should please have some understanding.

[The music programme is starting. Break in recording, resumes when Shri Mataji is speaking]

Shri Mataji: There are Indian songs in Indian languages. There are so many Indians who are sitting together here and there like groups. So I think that they should sit with other people one by one and explain to them what these people are singing. Then they will enjoy it more. [Applause].

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi].

If those of us who are Indians sit together and those from other countries sit separately, then it is not right. So you may have one Indian sit with some of the foreigners and translate, then it will be very nice. Everyone will also enjoy it more. It is very important.

I also noticed quite a few people were sleeping off; maybe they did not rest during the day. So it is better to take some rest during the day.

[In English] I saw so many people were sleeping off. I think you must take rest in the daytime. We have most of our programmes in the evening. Tomorrow again we are going to have music. As Baba Mama says, from six o’clock. Because I am worried about your dinner now. And the day after tomorrow, from nine o’clock in the morning – I am sorry to say that – but there is prize distribution only for Indians. The leaders of the Western countries and Australia and Eastern foreigners, I would say, should come here. Just to give a presence to the Indians; the leaders.

On the 25th evening, there is a puja. We are organising a very famous drama on Shivaji. There are two hundred actors in it and actresses. We will try to arrange it here only. On the 26th. And the qawwals are coming on the 27th. M Rajan on the 28th. Weddings on 29th. In the morning we will have haldi and in the evening, the marriages. 

Most of the marriages have been fixed. But still, I am doubtful about one or two about which we will inform you. You better meet other people with whom you have been engaged. Try to find out all about it and then decide. Now there are three, four days. So I hope you do not make a mistake. Just talk to them. And I think you may; most of you will agree. But if you don’t, don’t hesitate. I will be very happy. Don’t leave it to Me. It’s your decision. You shouldn’t say if Mother wants, of course, I will do it. That I will never accept.

You have to decide for yourself, see for yourself. I have just given a guideline. It’s no compulsion, no ruling about it. So you have to just see for yourself and decide for yourself. Thank you very much. [applause].
