Makar Sankranti Puja, Pune (India), January 14th, 1991

Today is the exhibition for this special day of the fourteenth of January, is this, that this is the only day which is observed in India, according to the Sun, Surya.The Sun moves from the tropic of Capricorn towards the tropic of Cancer. So the Sun is worshipped on the fourteen, but Indians think that this is a blessing to have the Sun here for all the things [unsure].

But when the Sun moves from the Capricorn, which is called as ‘Makar’, they say that it is the greatest ordinary now on the Capricorn, and that we are better off. So, we have to celebrate. But by the celebration, they keep in mind that a lot heat will reflect on them. And we start talking to each other in a very cocky manner. So, they give this ‘till’ and ‘gul’. These both things are sesame seeds with some jaggery, they give you, because both things are very hot. Because they think that this hot jaggery will just help you to fight with the cold, [unclear] so better tune up the body to this coming heat.But they know also that with the Sun, you all get hot, everybody fights with each other. So, they say that, "Take ‘till’ and say something sweet". Better to say something sweet because with the Sun, you get really out of gear, and people decide to talk to each other in a very good manner. So, they say, "All right, take 'till' and say something sweet".
