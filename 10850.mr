Evening Program, Beauty Must Have Auspiciousness

God almighty created this universe, in a very beautiful manner. I have told you many a time the story of creation, and how the evolution took place.

The mirror, is made to see your face, and God almighty could not see himself. His qualities, His greatness, His generosity, His magnanimity. Like the sun cannot see itself. Moon cannot see itself. Like the gold cannot see itself. A pearl, how can it go inside itself and see itself? So, this creation was made like a mirror, for God to see His reflection. Ultimately He created the most beautiful mirror that is human beings.

At this point it would have been alright, if, Adam and Eve had not used their freedom wrongly. There would have been not such a long time and, had to go through evolutionary process with all the [UNCLEAR incarnations] coming in, guiding people. And today, at this time, to get to your spirit, to express God in your mirror fully.

This has taken a long long process. But if you see it’s so beautifully done. I think, that’s the play of Mahamaya. That, first of all, beautiful worlds were created, beautiful starts were created, you see them around. Then beautiful mountains and rivers. Then beautiful plant kingdom came in, and the beautiful variety of trees. So much of Varieties. Varieties bring forth the beauty of God’s own imagination. A leaf of any tree cannot match, with any other leaf, and also of the same kind. In a little thing like area of that leaf, there is a little variation, which is mathematically I think raised to power 108 to 108. That you cannot make out, or you cannot create two leaves of the same type. It is God’s own whim and His own wish, that He has shown His variety and esthetics in creating this wonderful world.

But all these esthetics, have been worked out the best in the human beings. And human beings started expressing that quality of God in their creation. [UNCLEAR].

The creation started, at the hands of human beings, expressed in such a manner, that the beauty was brought in with the holy eyes of the holy men. In the beginning of the times if you see, whether it is in the west or in the east, anywhere, people created temples. Like we have here [UNCLEAR], [UNCLEAR], we have caves and caves all over. But very close to us is this [UCLEAR] caves which was built in 10 centuries. And was cut out, hewed out of one rock without using any cement, anything, from top to bottom they started hewing it out and leaving it for next generations, next generations, might be 15 to 16 generations, might have done this tremendous task with such dedication and devotion and with such precision.

Because of their holiness, because of their dedicated devotion to Buddha whom they had never seen, Buddha never came down to south. And they created such beautiful monumental work, because they wanted to express the beauty of God’s creative qualities. Even in the west you have seen great artist like Michelangelo and many others, who have created something of eternal beauty.

Then there are people who started, reflecting God in the musical notes and in the rhythm, of this universe. Then there are poets who started singing, the beauty of God, and His greatness in their lyrics. That is how, the beauty is expressed, through the holy hands of holy people, all over the world. I don’t know nowadays if it is done so.

Even in those days, at the time of Socrates, Lao-tzu, philosophy was the dominating subject.  People thought philosophy was the epitome of knowledge. But suddenly then it turned to economics and that’s the place we have, we lost our heritage of creativity, of the Divine values, of the Divine Gunas.

People started depicting, things that would sell. And to sell the things they had to appeal to the masses. And the masses who were of very low grade human beings were pleased by very vulgar expression of beauty. That’s how the vulgarity started growing up. Even in the language, this transformation took place, and people took to very cheap expressions of very superficial themes and very low grade humor. The whole thing was based on giving a very mundane type of entertainment to people.

On the music side same thing happened. The music that was used to please the Gods and Goddesses, was used to please the kings and the queens. And from them, it came to the masses, and when it came to the masses it became even a very cheap frivolous music. Same about dancing, same about all the arts that were created to reflect the beauty of God, the mirror of God. All that we got from all the 5 elements, was reduced to ashes by the value system that changed our ideas.

The worst that happened to all the arts was that it was just on mental level, not on the auspicious level. On the mental level it was judged, of course, the money was very important. Though they may talk of big things, the color scheme and all that, it was the money part of it. The whole creation became a very [UNCLEAR prosaic], massive nonsense, which was sold in the market alright. But was so temporary and so transitory that it went, in the next generation, into waste paper baskets. It has no intrinsic value of any sustenance, nor it had any joy in it, so it all got lost.

In literature, we have seen how people have taken a complete juxtaposition to go to hell I should say and to carry all those who read them with them. The perversity of the literature has gone beyond any comprehension. All that perversity, has to be avoided by Sahaja Yogis and have to be judged on the auspicious lines. Because beauty must have auspiciousness. Anything that is beautiful must give vibrations otherwise it is not beauty. If does not give vibrations, then it is not beautiful.

The coefficient of beauty is auspiciousness. It has to give vibrations. If it does not give vibrations, it should not be accepted by you as something beautiful. The mental projection about it that if it is so, then it is beautiful, if it is not, it’s not beautiful. Then they started branding things, that this is this style, that is the style, that is the style, and then you had to keep to their styles. And if you just try to avoid the styles, then you became a different person. And just to create a new styles, they just became like [UNCLEAR]. Without any concern to reality, or to the beauty, that is auspiciousness.

It is now for Sahaja Yogis to come out of all these nonsensical ideas. And understand that it was just a maya of stupidity that we indulge into with our ego. We have to be, very firmly standing, on reality which is auspiciousness itself. If it is reality, it must give vibrations. If it is unreal, it will not give vibrations. Like you can see, a flower which is plastic cannot give vibrations, a flower which is living gives you vibrations. To this purity of understanding one has to rise.

This is how the Sahaja Yoga acts in even in every age, these small children who are gathered, they have themselves arranged all the program, they have composed everything and without talking any help from the elders and they have become so dynamic. There all doing very well in classes, most of them are first class, first, scholarship holders and it’s something so dynamic that has happened to them and the way they have composed the whole thing, this is all their own poetry, everything their own. So can imagine how beautifully Sahaja Yoga can act on simple hearts. May God bless them.

Yogi: [UNCLEAR]

Part 2

Yogi: I think we’re going to have the whole night because after dinner I have got a list of artists including a Qawal. So I’m trying to go, trying to, trying to satisfy your insatiable urge for music.

Shri Mataji: See, Qawali is a style, developed by a realized soul called Amir Khosro. He was a devotee of [UNCLEAR Pazan Nazim?] [UNCLEAR Nezam-udin-Kasa] from Delhi. He was another realized soul. They call him [UNCLEAR Aolias]. A realized soul, what we call Avadotas, were called as [UNCLEAR Aolias]. Now, among the Muslims, realized souls didn’t have that place in the, organizational’s method of worship. So because Amir Khosro was a realized soul he recognized his great guru. He went to him and he started learning about self-realization and everything form him. And we had another one [UNCLEAR], a great soul. Now these two great souls were on this earth but were not accepted by Mullahs because they were not realized souls. So, so many people became devotees, of these [UNCLEAR Aolias] and they say [UNCLEAR Aolias] have no caste. Just like Sahaja Yogis have no caste.

Now, this Qawali started in the praise of the spirit and all that by Amir Khosro and this Qawali system started working out throughout in the country, now even in Pakistan we have some very great Qawals who are realized souls also. I’ve seen one of them was Nusrat Hussain or something like that. Is a very well-known Qawal. And he immediately recognized me. He’s also a realized soul.

Now the Qawali was sung only by men, and in the praise of God, like Bhajan. And it has a style. But then, as everything gets perverted, Qawali got also perverted, and cheap women started singing them in a very cheap way, it’s all got spoiled.  But I’m very happy that again I can hear this Qawali back in the praise of God. And now [UNCLEAER] has done a greater [UNCLEAR salute] to Amir Khosro by adding, realization, as the theme of Qawali. Realization. There was just a praise, but realization was not so much discussed. Though Amir Khosro has sung about it and he’s very much, symbolically singing about self-realization. Amir Khosro.

So this is the tradition of Amir Khosro and all these great saints, [UNCLEAR Aolias] of different places that they were worshiped this way through Qawali. But this is a specialty only of India. Only in India you get Qawals. Nowhere else.

Shri Mataji: The atmosphere is completely charged as, my brother is saying, with happiness, joy, bliss that we could ever think of. As if the Heavens have come down and the God’s realm is already expressing itself in your hearts. May God bless you.

Thanks, artist.

I would like to thank the artist who brought forth such beautiful rendering and such beautiful rhythm in your hearts. That you all got completely drenched into the nectar of bliss. May I thank them from my heart and bless them for, very happy and prosperous new year and a new life. May God bless you.

So, tomorrow morning, about, we’ll start our Puja about, I said 10 o’clock you could be here, but start about 11 o’clock I hope that would be convenient for you. May God bless you.
