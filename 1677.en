Shri Adi Shakti Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 23 June 2002.

Today it's a different day altogether for all of you because this is the puja of Adi Shakti, and Adi Shakti is a complete personality. It's not only the Left Side that you know.

You all know only the Left Side, from Shri Ganesha through the ascent of different, different chakras on the Left Side. I didn't want to tell you about the Right Side to begin with, because those who have gone through the Right Side got just lost.

&nbsp;

They got Gayatri Mantra from the writings but they didn't know what it was about, they just used to learn it by heart. They didn't also know the real meaning of it, and that is how they moved on the Right Side and, I don't know, they landed up at the Agnya; and then they were trying for the Self-realisation. They were promised that, if you do this Right Side properly, you will reach to the ultimate goal of Self-realisation, but none of them reached it. Most of them got into a terrible temper, terrible temper of cursing others, of destroying others. All these things they learnt through their right-side movement. There was no Kundalini awakening, and they were made to go up to the, at the most, Agnya chakra, and then they collapsed into different places of complete ignorance.

&nbsp;

All these books were written without understanding that it's not easy to go via Right Side, but the best was to awaken your Kundalini. The Kundalini directly takes you up in the centre of all the chakras, up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya, and goes beyond Agnya into the Sahastrara, and then it pierces through the Sahastrara.

&nbsp;

Now, what is so important about the Brahmarandhra, from where it pierces? I never told you about it. But now I think for most of you the time has come. You see in the childhood the child has a talu, is the fontanelle bone area which is pulsating always. It is pulsating because the Spirit entered through that area, and when you close it, it settles in the heart. Now you have to become the Spirit-oriented person, but how to enter into the Sahastrara was the problem.

&nbsp;

The tantrikas who were there, they went through the Left Side, and they developed all the practices of black - we should say, the Left Side. So the right-sided became extremely hot-tempered, extremely hot-tempered, I should say, extremely ambitious, ferocious, and they started killing people on the basis of cursing, they were very good at cursing people, to be always forward, push back all the people, and override everybody's rights. They were regarded as the most ambitious and most powerful people.

&nbsp;

Now the brahmins and to some extent the kshatriyas, they then took to the Right Side. Because of the Right Side they became very powerful, no doubt. They got all the powers over the world and they were regarded as extremely powerful and majestic people, but they were not, because they were so hot-tempered. Hot-tempered people cannot be spiritual. So they were told, "You'll get your spirituality, don't worry, keep moving." And the seven chakras were described, on the Right Side.

&nbsp;

According to them there is bhuh, bhurvah. 

Bhuh is this prithivi, is this world, bhuh. 

Bhurvah is the complete cosmos, or we can call it antariksha. 

Swaha. Swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra, and swadha is the, swadha is the consumption inside, is to absorption. Swaha, swadha.

Then is the mind, heart - manah. After manaha came the Vishuddhi. The Vishuddhi is janah, collectivity, people, go to the people - janah.

Then at the Agnya it is tapah. In tapaha we have Christ in the centre. Left side they had Jainism, Right Side Christianity. They were not actually ascending path, they were just side outlets, you can say (laughing), for the energy of people who were trying to seek the Truth.

&nbsp;

Now this happened for ages in India. All the gurus, all the sadhus, all the big tapasvis, all of them did this, but where did they reach? Tapasvis were the people who could give curses – kshu - sharp, to people. They could curse somebody. With the kataksha, is with the glance of the eye, they could kill somebody, they could burn something. All right-sided powers they had, and with these right-sided powers, where did they reach? To hell, I should say, in a way - if not, in the limbo, as you call it. There nobody got Self-realisation. You read the old books from India, but even otherwise the Greeks, and then we had Egyptians, English and all kinds of aggressive people. Germans. All of them were aggressive. Catholics, and also you had Romans, all of them were aggressive, and were taking the land and property of other countries. Extremely aggressive. They believed in the killing of the people. Extremely, insulting, hot-tempered people.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So how to bring them to the normal, to the central path? One side was, as I told you, bhuh, bhurva, swaha, swadha, it's consumption - this was done by Guru Principle. Then we have manah,  janah - that is collective. They became collective, no doubt, because they were so powerful that they had such a lot of people with them to fight for the oppressive. With their oppressive temperament they were fighting on people and were oppressing them.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

All this kind of generation came in the history, as you know, and then it disappeared. Wars were created, then so many people were killed. We had Hitler as the maximum of cruelty. They never cared for humanity. Then ultimately it came to the Agnya. Agnya also they killed Jesus Christ, they destroyed Jesus Christ. They destroyed so many great saints who were really saints through the central path; some were incarnations, and they destroyed them.

 

&nbsp;

All this happened since the time of Rama, all that has happened. And, one after another, so many rakshasas came, and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world. Extremely arrogant show-offs, as we can call them. Very aggressive people. And this aggression came, came with such a great force, and followed one after another. It went up to a point. When people reacted, they were killed and were destroyed. So horrible people were created. All these people, as they were. Aggressive and destructive.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This nature is still within us, some people, because they are right-sided. All right-side people had this problem: temper, aggression, controlling others. The growth stopped, and there was no spiritual growth. They wanted to have spirituality, but with this kind of behaviour they had developed, spirituality ran away. We had so many incarnations. They all were killed, crucified, or were finished. There was no possibility of saving human beings in general. One bad man came and he ruined the whole world. We had one Hitler who really hit all the people, all the countries, all the nations, and we were all finished.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

All this is because we have taken to right-sided movement which they thought was easier for spirituality, which was not. So they crossed all the limits, and they reached a stage that they became absolutely devils, rakshasas, without realising that human beings are rakshasas, that's what they become. Even their gurus were like that, and nothing but they tortured even the incarnations, all the incarnations were tortured by them. It was really, how they saved themselves is remarkable. But ultimately they couldn't produce any results.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So the first thing I tried was to study about the Kundalini, that I should be able to raise the Kundalini. And I knew I had come for that, not for anything else, but only to raise the Kundalini of people so that they take to the central path, not to the right or to the left. But I told you the knowledge of the Left Side, plus raising your Kundalini. By raising your Kundalini you broke your Sahastrara, and you entered into the realm of real joy of reality.

 

All these bad qualities started falling out. In the central path first the Mooladhara came. By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the central path, you became very pure people: your eyes became pure, your licentiousness went away, your cheapness went away and you became very, very - I think we should call them - the Holy People. Unless and until that happens you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga. You cannot be a licentious, you cannot be a flirtish, you cannot be a man who wants to grab money from others and all that, or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So all such people were thrown out. Once they were thrown out they were showing their teeth, I should say. They didn't like it that they were thrown out. But they understand now, some of them, that "We have made mistakes."

 

So first thing is that you must develop your sense of chastity, respect it and enjoy it. That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened. That's the first chakra on the Left Side, where you have Shri Ganesha. But on the Right Side also we have deities. On every chakra we have deities to compensate, but Shri Ganesha is in the centre, and that's how we were blessed by His powerful purity, and we started understanding the beauty of purity, the power of purity. That's how our Right Side we finished off. Right side was for fighting, for killing, anger. There was no peace for these people. The only thing they knew how to dominate others, and to be intolerable.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So then they rose to a higher, higher level, of Swadisthan. In Swadisthana they rose, and the aggressiveness of the creative people to create something. Even now we have many: they create all kinds of nonsense, create all sorts of grotesque [artistic movement, creation of ugly things like Halloween masks] also very, very, I should say, dirty things to make a name. So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana, people who wanted to have a name, a position. That came from Right Swadisthana.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Then the third chakra that was there was the Nabhi chakra. On the Nabhi chakra they went all out to make money, not Lakshmi but money. Money by any means, and they cheated the whole world. With this money that they got, they did all kinds of bad things. Either they cheated or they were aggressive. Cheating was very much in the left-side countries like India, and aggressiveness in the right-side countries.

 

In the centre, what quality we have at the Swadisthana is the creativeness: creative of art, which is very beautiful, which is very deep, which is absolutely spiritual. That vanished, and people started showing even the incarnations full of dirty habits. All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Then, as I told you, there's Nabhi. In Nabhi people got after money. Left-sided people were making money, right-sided were aggressive with their money. If they were earning they thought they're on top of the world. If they had money they thought, "Nobody is better than us!" All this finished them off, it's finishing. It will come to that point where they will realise that money is not for destroying but for construction: constructing of the country, constructing of the human beings together to bring peace and love among them. For helping. For doing all kinds of good things.

&nbsp;

Then the same right-sided people went to the chakra of the Mother, and they were horrible mothers, tried to dominate their children, dominate everyone, and could not sacrifice anything for the children. We have had enough of these women who are aggressive with their husbands, are aggressive with their children. And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished. All that kind of lot when I came on this Earth I saw, and I was shocked, “What sort of human beings are those? What am I going to do with them? How will I awaken their Kundalini?” At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost, but now it is the Mother's chakra. They had no fatherhood, no motherhood, they draw out their children. Very selfish, self-centred, dominating parents. This was at the Heart Chakra.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Then came the collective chakra, what we call as the Vishuddhi. At the Vishuddhi Chakra they wanted to occupy the whole world. They wanted to occupy the whole world as their own to become emperors, and they formed empires and misbehaved to such an extent that it's not humanly possible to behave like that. They really were rakshasas, I should say, and those rakshas qualities are still there. In their behaviour, in everything you can see how they behave towards people, treating them like that. Creating people who are against spirituality, and those who are aggressive. Then this became like a two-sided world where there are people who are aggressive, and the people who are tortured. This two-sided world exists, even now, but is much less. Thanks to the collective understanding there are many good institutions that were established but they are not working out, they are not so successful, because the men at the head of it are controlling, but controlling what? Not themselves,  controlling others. And all their behaviour has spoilt all the work of this chakra.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Collectively we have, if you see around now today, everywhere there's war going on, fights going on, killing going on, destruction going on. How is it? There are so many spiritual people now on this world. So the reason is, the spiritual people have become very quiet, very much enjoying their spiritual life, have become very quiet and very peaceful people. But that doesn't bring peace! You have to be dynamic and you have to bring peace in the world. You have to do something about it. And we are very much satisfied with our progress, but we are not bothered as to see what is the progress others have done, how far they have gone, where can we meet them, what can we change them. At My level I can change many things, but at your level how many people have you changed? What have you done?  That has to be seen.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya, and you are very happy with your peace, with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga. This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today, that those who are all so spiritual, those who have achieved great heights are least bothered as to what good has to be done. What they are doing is to enjoy their own spirituality, come to the puja, have more and more of it. But they have done no collective work to change people.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Some of them are working, one or two, bas! (hindi:that’s all) But the rest of them are having a good time enjoying themselves in such a manner that people accept them as great souls, good people, that's all. I would like you to now introspect and find out how much collective work you have done, how many people you have got - like that. With whom are you talking? How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga? Only so many are there. Christ had only twelve disciples; they were much more dynamic than you are.

&nbsp;

So now you should take to the Right Side. And when you take to the Right Side we'll create dynamic people, not just some useless, patient, very quiet, peaceful people. This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga. The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change, change so many. And those who are doing that, all My blessings are with them. But those who are just keeping to themselves, it is not a very good thing. In your country how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga? Just find out. With how many people you have worked it out?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So yours is not a complete yoga, yours is a partial yoga of the Left Side, where you are very loving, you are very kind, very this thing. I am not saying that you should become aggressive in any way. But even I have seen people want to be leaders, they want to be something great, but how many people have they given realisation? How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I have said even in the aeroplane also you go, you walk in the street, anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga. But here we are using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness, for our understanding of ourselves. This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you. It has been brought to you for giving realisations to many people.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I request all the younger people, younger generation, not to waste their Sahaj energies on nonsense as the old people have done. You better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yoga, and spread the Sahaja Yoga. They are more interested in running schools, in looking after the destitutes, doing this, doing that. That's not your job. Your job is to create more sahaja yogis, more sahaja yoginis. But that is not there, what I find is it's not there. The Right Side is missing. You should come to the Right Side. Go all ahead. Nothing will happen to you. Nobody can kill you, nobody can disturb you, nobody can arrest you. Take it from Me! You have powers but if you don't use them, you are like this.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

That is why we have come to the stagnated point that we should know we have to use our Right Side. Right side is very important. Next time I'll tell you about Right Side, what right-sided things you have.

 

Now you cannot become left-sided whatever you may try. So you use your Right Side in the right direction with the right understanding. Not as some sort of, I should say, very arbitrary or very dominating, like Hitlers. We have had also Hitlers among sahaja yogis! But now (laughing) the time has come for you to do something more than what the saints have done before. To work it out that way. Not to keep to yourself that you have a family, you have very nice children, having, enjoying, all that. That's not [what] the Sahaja Yoga [is] for. Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world. You have to think about it: What are you doing? Where are you? And what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

&nbsp;

Then we come to the Agnya. In Agnya what has happened is sahaja yogis are become, they have, they can bear anything, they can suffer anything - that's not [what] we want. What we want [is] to remove the sufferings of others, remove the aggression of others. So we don't, that kind of organisation we don't have, that kind of understanding we don't have. And if that works out, you will be different people.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So we have become like saints, you see, sitting in their hermit halls, something like that, not more than that. So better try to do something positive without aggression. I know some of you are still very aggressive, are show-offs, I know that. But if you get into the mood of working out collectively then you will realise what mistakes you have, still what is lacking in your personality. That is very important.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

At Agnya Chakra many sahaja yogis falter, I don't know what happens to them. At Agnya I have told that you must forgive but that doesn't mean that you allow people to do wrong things. Because you want to forgive it's very easy not to fight, not to say anything, just keep out, just forgive - no! You go and talk to that person and tell him it is wrong. You have to face it. If you cannot face it then you are useless, just like any other people. What's the use of you people getting your realisation?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So now we have to understand that it's not only that we have vibrations, that we are all right, that you can cure some people is the last word - no! You have to spread it, you have to go in the public, you have to be collective on this point and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga. With so many sahaja yogis all over the world we have not progressed much. So now it is you have to plan what you want to do, how you want to do it, and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga. It's very important. Because you people are good at, say, talking about Sahaja Yoga, singing about Sahaja Yoga; all these things are useless unless and until you have concrete proof of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

&nbsp;

 

In a small country like Turkey we have 25,000  sahaja yogis - what do you say? They are all Muslims, 25,000 Muslim becoming sahaja yogis, while you find that number is very small in any other country. They are not very rich, but they care for their Self-realisation and for giving Self-realisations to others. It's very surprising how it has worked out, how it has spread.

&nbsp;

So instead of thinking of your problems, of your enemies, of your powers, think of giving power to others and making them Sahaja Yoga. Is very important. If you are in Sahastrara then you have all the powers. In Sahastrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga, what's the use of getting realisation? Just for yourself? It's being very selfish.

 

So I would say that instead of spreading your own glory, your own name, please, try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga. Go into a very dynamic force.

&nbsp;

So many people have complained to Me that sahaja yogis are nothing but dead people. Is that what you are? Only single person like Me has done so much work, so why not you people? In your country have you worked it out all over? Just think about it. And that's why, unless and until you don't do it you are not sampurna, you are not complete, and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood in its full form.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

That's why I'm telling you today it's a very important day that you worship Me as Adi Shakti. But you should know that Adi Shakti has to be a complete form. It cannot be only half Left-sided - no. If that doesn't work out, then what's the use? It's like any other getting any other realisation - that's not so important. Not only that you should spread, but also you should make them, and realise it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

All My blessings, all My love, all My powers I give you but try to understand. Alright?

 

Thank you very much.
