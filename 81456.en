 (England)
No, totally the opposite. I wasn't an intellectual at all. I ran away from home, ran away from school, and wondered where I fitted into society. I tried everything.

And then I was on Crete with my two children; they were 11 and 14, living in a cave. We had fresh water—it was a freshwater beach—and I was smoking. One boat a week came around, and we got supplies from there. Everything was totally wrong. We didn't wear any clothes, and one of my kids was 14, bless him. I mean, really, I don't know.

Anyway, it later turned out that the cave I was living in was a swayambhu. A Greek leader gave it to Mother as a present; it was this black rock. In this cave, a voice, a dawning, came into my heart, right inside. I remember it so clearly because it's not a word I would use. It said, "You will find what you are looking for; you will find it in the bottom of your heart." It was this dawning, and within one week, I had my realization.

This was from Crete, back to Brighton. I went straight back home to Brighton. I was just about to get into meditation with all the false gurus there—everything was on the table. The person who was looking after my cats while we were travelling said, "Oh, I know of someone. I've got a friend who's into that sort of thing as well, and he gets a cool breeze of hot tea."

And I said, "That's it! That's it! You've got to take me, you've got to take me!"

It was Kingsley. Kingsley and his girlfriend had just gotten their realization in London three weeks prior. He was the only person outside of London, in Brighton, which is Shri Ganesh's place. So, I kept saying to the chap, "You must take me."

I went there, and he was all shaking—it was very exaggerated then. This chap, Kingsley, came down with long hair. We went up into his little room with all these cats and a pyramid. He was dressed in red with his long hair, and there was this mirror on the wall with all these pictures. There was a little black and white photocopy of Shri Mataji; you could hardly see it. He said, "That's a picture of God." I remember thinking, "I'm so glad God's female."

Anyway, we sat down in front of this mirror. He said, "I'm just going to look at you." I could see myself in this mirror, and I could see this smile getting absolutely fixed on my face. He said, "I'm just going to say some words which might help." On the back of a piece of newspaper, on the side, was written "Om Twa Mavis"—actually, it was Mother's Mantra.

Anyway, I said, "Whatever it is, I think I've got it! I feel amazing! I've got it!" I had this big grin.

He said, "That's great! Well, should we have a joint to celebrate?" Because this is what you did.

I said, "Well, I feel pretty stoned already."

He said, "So do I."

It was just great. We were just talking, and within a few minutes, the whole thing made sense because he talked about reincarnation. That was it. I went home singing "The Lord's My Shepherd," the sort of thing I knew.

That night and in the morning, I thought, "This is amazing." I saw my friend and said, "I didn't realize that the heaven and the bliss and everything that you were looking for could be like this," because I thought that was illegal. It was just amazing. And that was it. That was it.
