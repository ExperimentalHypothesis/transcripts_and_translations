All right, all right.

Now being 70 marriages, you all have to be very cooperative and you have to be very adjusting with each other that you understand. I would suggest that first of all the parents of the girl, who so ever they are.

[Shri Mataji switches language]

To tell that you have to just do the Aarti of the boy and put the red [UNCLEAR] on his head, slowly. No to spoil him, his dress or anything that's all. But don't spend too much time already, we are late because of certain things so we have to be careful of time, all right. Now, the girls have to stand in a line from the first starting at that end to this end. From one line will be there. Now when they are walking they have to walk with their heads bent downward and see that in front of you there are things so don't trample over them, that's all. You can be carefully walking together.

There's no need to keep them inside. As it is, let it be. Now walk carefully! Now...

[Indian yogis asking Shri Mataji a question]

Now what is it you see, you have to stand in a line after doing the Gauri thing, worship. That's only one second job, you have to come and put the flowers at My feet, finish. And then you go and stand in [your] number. From first starting from there up to this point. All right? And there will be, huh?

[Indian yogi asking Shri Mataji a question]

And then you all have to stand in a line from one to the seventy number. You have to walk through these things which are kept there. You have to be careful. There will be a [UNCLEAR] as you call it. The clock that will keep you in your [UNCLEAR] and then that will be removed after saying seven verses to Vishnu [UNCLEAR]. After that you have to take the garland and you have to put first the garland to the boy. And then the boy will put the garland. Now recognise your husbands. [Laughter]

Don't put it into somebody else's neck because we are so many, all right? That's the only problem is, all right. Then there will be a bridesmaid will be walking with the girl. And other people, bridesmaids will be walking with the girl and the best man will be standing with the boys. Now the only thing will be that when the girls are walking, let the other people stay back. But those who are the parents have to go out, stand there and do the Aarti of the bridegroom but do it the fast way that you just put the Aarti and put the red on them. For the time being that is all right that will do, later on I'll guide you, all right? Now must know these are seventy marriages and we have to be very cooperative and attentive, please thank you very much. I hope all of you understand English, is there anybody who doesn't understand English? You didn't follow? What language you speak? Huh, Italian. You follow the others, you follow the others, it's all right. You follow the others, it's all right. I mean we now have here fourteen languages, fourteen or fifteen languages altogether excluding Indian languages. So you can imagine.

Where is the mic?

1:00:09

And now the bridegrooms are arriving, keep these garlands in your hands and...

Now keep these garlands behind and the flower ones in front so when you put it these garlands come in front. You better stand up now, all the girls. You can distribute these flowers also for people for [UNCLEAR]. All the people who are coming from outside. All the girls must put down their heads and see what is in front of you. Distribute, distribute fast. You have to walk very, very, very slowly. Very very slowly. You have to just walk up to this space.

They have to go to the Aarti. All of you should put down your heads and walk slowly and see your husbands respectfully. All the bridesmaids must stand behind the brides. And they should not move with the girls, they should stay in their own places. Everybody has gone. Face this side, towards this. All the bridesmaids must stay or can walk with their brides but carefully not to trample over things which are kept on the ground. All the bridesmaids can walk and walk with the brides with the care that they don't trample over the things that are kept. Let the boys come fast and tell them not to have a very long Aarti, just to put an Aarti fast way.

The garlands should be [UNCLEAR] that the shining one should be behind, walk with garlands in front of you with your bent heads. Before garlanding see the face of your husbands otherwise you may garland somebody else. [laughter]

What's this, you stand here, your number one. All right stand here, all right, good. He never got it, all right he will bring one for him. Ah keep the shining one on the backside, shining one on the backside. Come by numbers, please stand by numbers. Are you coming by numbers?

Yogi: No, no, they are not coming by numbers.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no they should come by numbers. Ah Richard what's your number? Three. What's yours? Then it's all right. They are coming by numbers only! Just see, Ruth just see that they come by numbers together. This is for... coming by numbers. You have to walk very slowly. The girls have to walk, not the boys. You have to walk very, very slowly, there are seven [UNCLEAR] which you have to so for these three and a half feet. All right, very slowly and the boys should stay there, let the girls garland you, bend your heads and then you garland the girls, again I'll tell you.

You are all the sisters? All the mothers of the boys should stand behind, behind the boys. All the mothers of the boys should stand behind the boys. Your mother has come out.

1:10:38

Now you can't see.

[Shri Mataji talking to Babamama and Indian yogis]

1:17:04

All of them.

Babamama: You have to watch the rice when you walk.

Shri Mataji: The rice is in front of the girls, be careful not to walk on them.

Yogi: Did you bring the [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Just come this side - more a little bit. Nick, are you taking them from the top? From the top you might be able to. If you want a little bit more this side. Just more this side more, just move out, just a little bit more this side. Girls should also move out here. Just take a little side, side attitude. See just forward, backwards little bit.

Yogi: One, one person ahead? One person...

Shri Mataji: Slightly, slightly not quite. Best men have to go behind the grooms. Stand behind the grooms! The best men. Please stand behind the grooms. See what is this you have got? All the best men should go and stand behind the bridegrooms and the fathers should wait - Oh they can also go and stand, it's all right. And the fathers also should stand behind, the fathers should also stand but don't move just stand, fathers or mothers or both.

1:22:51

Alternately the boys should move little back than the other one because there's little less room. Little bit, alternately. With alternated numbers, say first, third, like that should move backwards. Little bit. Odd numbers should be little bit behind, odd numbers little bit behind, all the odd numbers.

Babamama: One, three, five, seven like that should be little bit behind and the even numbers a little ahead.

Shri Mataji: Now their position, ah okay. Now the boys should not move and their mothers or fathers or the bride - I'm sorry, bridegrooms should not move, neither their mothers and non, their other relations we can say. Best men and mother and father, whatever. Now the girls have to move and behind them slowly, very carefully there is also a lot of rice on the ground. Be carefully the girls should move and then nobody should move from that side. From the girls' side they can wait there because it's very close so I don't want you to have a chaos, all right? Now the music will start, they will have to move very slowly, this pace has to be done very very slowly. All right, lala.

Now, [UNCLEAR] when they said '[UNCLEAR] mungalum' you have to put the rice you have got in your hand, the people who have come to witness the wedding. The rice that you have at every [UNCLEAR] and the girls should move slowly, slowly, seven steps up to the boys. And then the boys should bend their heads, accept the garlands and then garland the girls. All right, so we are starting now, the music will start.

1:26:15

Just wait, just wait. Not all of that, you have to do it seven times. Slowly walk, slowly walk. Keep your heads down. Careful about the rice. Walk in a line together.

1:31:39

The last now. [UNCLEAR]

So please, all of you who are organising, slowly, slowly all of you. First of all, find out a kunda and put these people there. Take them together. Hold each other's hands, hold each other's hands, the boy, hold her hand.

If you don't find a serial number, sit anywhere you feel like. Sit wherever you feel like, no serial number needed. Sit wherever you feel like. Sit down. Boy on one side and girl on another side, I think.

1:39:00

Ah the bride and the bridegrooms should sit together. The bride should be on the right side of the husband to begin with. Right side! The bridegroom on the - bride is on the right side! Bride on the right side is correct. Hello? Bride... bride on the right side. Bride on the right side, bride. Bride and bridegrooms must sit in one line.

1:44:40

Hello?

1:50:11

Hello, now please be seated. Please be seated all of you. Now the first ceremony is called as giving the hand of the girl that is to be performed by the parents. So the first hand of the boy is to be made into a [UNCLEAR] like this. And in that the girls hands must be put on top of hers that is... and then the last is the fathers hand. And the mother will pour water from where you see little, little not much in the kunda. Little on the sides of the kunda, on the side of the kundas. Not in the kunda.

1:51:33

Little water, not much. Now anybody who has not understood, you have got people behind you who know.

1:52:27

Nobody should talk, just keep quiet. Then only it will be done better. Now, just a minute... little bit of water, not much. Just see the mantras are going on. Now keep quiet.

1:54:00

Mothers must give their saris to the girl to wash that, they have to look after their daughter. Now the fathers have to say this, you have to repeat the sholak, slowly, slowly. The father. Now the boys, the bridegrooms have to say this [the sholak]. That means I accept the daughter of yours in Sanskrit language.

1:55:38

Now the girl has to touch, the boy has to touch, 'my right hand to the left shoulder, the left shoulder of the bride'. With the right hand, the shoulder, the left shoulder of the bride. Now he has to promise something, the girl, promise them. Take promises. He has to take some promises. They have to repeat it. The boys have to repeat. You need not to bitta, he will say for you or what is that you will work out with me, my dharma which is Sahaja Yoga and you will be work out all the Sahaja Yoga in our life. Now you have got something for tieing up, lying with you. There are two things you have got, I'll show you where. Now see here, now these, these are to be tied to each other in the left hand of the girl and the right hand of the boy on the wrist, on the wrist. Left hand of the girl and the girl should tie on the right hand of the boy. Those you don't understand the parents should tell or somebody should tell.

1:58:17

Now there is rice in front of you, rice. Yes, take a little rice in your hands, little rice for the boys. For the boys, the boys means the bridegrooms. Now you have to put it on the head of the girl, three times when he says whose mantras. Not just now when he says it. Three times. Three times please start.

These two seconds, Shri Ganesha on the Sahasrara. Three times, all right done. Now the boys have got the mangal sutras are the black things that I gave you. Now the best men must help the boys. Now this mangal sutra has to be put in the head of the girls, you better start from the back side so it's easier to put them. Open out the back, they should open out and put it right, the best men. The best men must open it out. Hold it in such a manner that the mangal sutras, those little, two little cups are facing outside. Just wait when I tell. The concave should be facing outside. Yes, put it from the backside, it's easier, I think from the, put it on the, yes properly. The bridesmaids must help. Other way round.

And the brother of the bride has to put, has to put the, the rice which we call as [UNCLEAR] in thier hands, little bit. In the [UNCLEAR]. Five times you have to do it so be careful. The brother has to do it, the brother of the bride. Maybe a small little boy. Don't talk if you talk there will be confusion, just say it slowly. First [UNCLEAR]. Are you all ready? First, first one! Now the brother has to put in the hand of the bride which is on top of the boys [UNCLEAR anjali]. Now first one when they say, don't be in a hurry. Now wait if you have put it.

And put it in the fire. Om swaha. One with the right hand not with the left hand. The boy should put it with the right hand, the girl must touch his right hand. Now second time.

Please get out without making noises or anything. I hope it has been lightened properly by you. All of you should be out. Now can you get out and sit down and make space for the boys - they have to go around the thing [havan].

2:13:50

There are seven mounds of rice on both the sides, now put them right. The mounds have been disturbed a little bit, put them in seven. One on the right hand side for every couple, for every couple the right hand side one. For every couple on the right hand side, so there may be two. You must leave room for these people to move out. You get out all of you and sit down somewhere or stand up. Make room for them.

Now break the first mound with your first toe. Break it like, yes break it. Just a minute stand up, just now don't break, just one minute [UNCLEAR].

2:20:08

And now break the first one. Now this means that you have to be a helpful wife to me all the time. Now wait until I tell you to break the other one. Now you have become my bride and you have to be the mother of very healthy realised children and look after them. Now break the second one.

2:21:53

By your third breaking you be my wife who will help me to accumulate punyas and to accumulate all that is beautiful. Break it. Now the fourth one the boy has to move forward and the girl has to move behind the boy. Slowly, now.

2:23:12

The bride may not... do the cloth of the boy, you keep to yourself. Now the girl is saying to the boy ''Now you have moved fourth step with me, now you look after my happiness and that is Sahaja Yoga'', you know that, all right, now break the fourth one. All right.

2:24:16

Now break the fifth one by saying that now you are coming on the fifth, all right break the fifth one. Now the fifth one says that ''You have to look after my children and children of all the Sahaja Yogis in a collective way''. All the Sahaja yogis, all the children of Sahaja yogis, our children, now. Now you have walked the sixth one so you become like six beautiful seasons to beautify the life of each other. Now the seventh one. ''Now you become my real friend by the seventh one, I declare that we are friends now for permanently we are friends''. Now we read it out to you, also in english which you have to take as Sahaja yogis.

Now listen to them, marriage vows. Bride says ''I will help to keep your mooladhara chakra in order, you hand over all wealth which is in your possession, I'll take care of those things. You should only eat the food that is cooked by me or your brothers and sisters means Sahaja yogis and if taken outside the home you will vibrate it. I will be loyal to you and you will be loyal to me. Bride says second time ''I will do all housework with my physical and spiritual powers and live it, love and affection and will obey you. You should help me in my work and I will help you in the work of Sahaja yoga''. Bride says ''I will keep my lakshmi chakra in order and you will respect my lakshmi twattas, this will keep your lakshmi twatta in order. You should give account of all you bring home, nothing will be hidden''.

Grooms say ''I will give you happiness and peace with love and affection but it will also have to think about my happiness and peace. You should not go outside without my permission and I will tell you when I go outside. I will not list consorting about the past and you will not discuss about the past''. Groom says ''You should take care of me and my children and if you should respect other sahaja brothers and sisters when they come to our house''. Groom says ''If I commit any mistakes while doing Sahaja Yoga you should excuse me and I will excuse you''.

Both say ''Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Nirmala Devi has put us in only bhandan by our marriage and this is a very great fortune by this act of Mataji as Maha-angya''. ''We will offer everything to her feet, that is our health, wealth, mind and heart. We will take an oath that we will be loyal to each other. We will work to increase Sahaja Yoga, we will bring our children up in Sahaja Yoga and that is our duty''. May God bless you, so this will be given to all of you, every one of you will be getting one.

2:28:34
