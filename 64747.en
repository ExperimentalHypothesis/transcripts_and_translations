Eve of Shri Ganesha puja, Cabella Ligure (Italy), September 9th, 1995

Nishat Khan plays on sitar Marva and Yaman ragas 

[Starts at 1:08:26]

Nishat Khan: I've played many concerts but I have never played Marwa. I have never played Marwa for Shri Mataji, because I wanted to play for very long time, and when I arrived this evening, somebody told me that Shri Mataji has asked to play now, at 6:30. I said in this light? And I thought Shri Mataji knows So, I'm really happy that I got to play this beautiful spiritual raga for you, Madam.Shri Mataji: I must say, apologize also, that Nishat Khan had told me that he would like to play on a Ganesha Puja. I had agreed also. But as you know the Swiss are veryparticular about time. They make all the watches.[Laughter]So, also we thought as there is very short time, I felt that he may not be happy to play for a short time something, because he likes to play for a long period.[Laughter]

But that's our privilege. But this time, as you know, I have to go on Monday, and I have not done yet my packing or anything. And then from there, directly to Russia. It's going to be quite a fast movement of marathon race of mine. So, we just thought that we’d better get somebody who is just coming up as a musician. And then we can have such a great artist like him later on when he will have more time to play. Especially, Marva is a raga which I like the most, perhaps. Because it is, as he says, it’s very meditative and very deep. And I remember first time, long, long time back, Asad Ali [Khan] sahib was there and he had invited me. They had never seen. And he was just playing some sort of a Bengali tune to begin with. And Sahaja Yogis told me that, "We were bored. And we thought he's better stop, that will be better". It's in the beginning. And as soon as he saw me on the doorstep, suddenly he told me his hand started moving. And he played Marva.My husband doesn't like Marva. Today only, first time again, it's the second time, that this was real Marva here. He, you see, he's a –No, no but something I must tell you that, that Marva he started playing. And after that, Asad Ali sahib became a great artist also. But that Marva, really, filled me completely with vibrations. He said, "Mother, I don't know. I knew all these things, but normally, they don't come to you easily. But as soon as you stand, I saw you standing there, and my hand started moving on Marva". I said, "You made the whole palace of Marva before me".
