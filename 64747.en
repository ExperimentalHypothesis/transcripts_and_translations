Eve of Shri Ganesha puja, Cabella Ligure (Italy), September 9th, 1995

Nishat Khan plays on sitar Marva and Yaman ragas 

Nishat Khan: I've played many concerts but I have never played Marwa. I have never played Marwa for Shri Mataji, because I wanted to play for very long time, and when I arrived this evening, somebody told me that Shri Mataji has asked to play now, at 6:30.

I had agreed also. But as you know the Swiss are veryparticular about time.
