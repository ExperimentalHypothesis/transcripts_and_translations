"Babamama is explaining his song to a group of Yogis. He gives the words of the chorus and ask for silence as Shri Mataji starts to speak.
Shri Mataji: It’s kabira who has sang because he was a dyer and he used to put colour on cloth and all kinds of things so he always used similes which were connected with his profession…. He said that. He said that -Oh, make my- “Jhini” (what does it mean)
Babamama:  colour. He reminds Shri Mataji the word of the song
Shri Mataji: colour- oh make my sheet that I’m colouring, that means his body, You’d better  color it “Jhini rigini”..
“Ma ke ranga me” means colour it up, means it should be coloured with that “ranga me”.
So now we have different key of the same part. (Inaudible)
Babamama: Shri Mataji something for Holi. Would you like to tell us something on Holi, this, I made it for Holi festival.
Shri Mataji: The Holi festival is coming now, today, actually, tomorrow is the Holi, but for our convenience we are going to have it on the 18. And the Holi festival was started by Shri Krishna, because before Shri Krishna was Shri Rama who was a very serious Incarnation to make human beings as perfect human beings and he’s called as Purushottama, he is the highest being among human beings. So the people were quite serious and they were doing everything so seriously and working out all kinds of rituals. Shri Krishna came and said : “Oh, it’s all lila, it’s all just a game. We have to play the game.” So he started this lila, in which he used colours and things to play with each other so that people should not feel inhibitions they should not come on down on inhibitions and every thing and all these conditionings that we have within us. And he used these colours just to make people very colourful and happy and to be enjoyable you see, just like children. This is what the Holi rehearse, celebrating on the 18th, but this is what they have- Baba has written something about it.
Babamama: I’ve written- Shri Mataji has made me to write you see
“Rang de jhini ma ke ranga me ye kara”. That oh the divine, please, give this body the colour of Shri Mataji. I have choosen the green colour. I should have chosen the blue colour. [laughs] She’s wearing a blue colour; it should be coloured in the colour of Shri Mataji.
“Ranga ma de chanchala mana ko, apne ranga me maya”. This mind which is so …so- so quick, so unstable, the mind which is so unstable, it’s likely that if we don’t colour it in the colour of Mother, may be it’ll be coloured in the colour of maya. So kaya and maya. Kaya is your body, maya you know what it is. . [laughs] Then the poet said:
“Kale pile rango ka he maila ye jagsara”. Then choosing various colour,
Shri Mataji: Balck and yellow, is the left and the right side
Babamama: Black and yellow. ka he maila ye jagsara. By the dirt,
Shri Mataji: All body is dirty with this colour.
Babamama: “Ise duniya ke sab rango se tera, hai ranga nyara”. Shri Mataji…-
Shri Mataji: [ In Hindi?]
Babamama: And the poet is saying that all these rungs, all these colours, are on one side and the colour of Mother is so distinguish
Shri Mataji: Unique
Babamama: So unique, so colourful. All the colours are on one side and Mother’s colour of love  is on one side that is the uniqueness of that colour.
“Sahaj Ko laha Hai, range ye tera koi utar na paya”. This is the colour which is permanent, which is eternal.
Shri Mataji: Sahaj colour.
Babamama: Sahaj colour which is eternal which is everlasting, which can never get faded by the effect of time or by any effect. This is the Sahaj colour, nobody can take it away from you, it’s a permanent thing, it shall remain ever. So the poet is trying to say that this colour has been now put on us, so we are the fortunate people, we are very coloured people. [laughs]
”Ham kya jane bhakti ranga me, man kaise ranga paya, rang ja yega us ranga me, tu jo vo rang charhaye”. Oh Mother we are too innocent to know to what would be the colour of my devotion? So there is, you see, the ranga means also how you get drowned in that means ..It’s very difficult to me.
Shri Mataji: [ In Hindi?]…
Babamama: Get drowned. To get “invotion” I know, Shri Mataji English language is quite difficult and my English is worse.
Sahaja Yogi: Immersed.
Shri Mataji: Immerse.
Babamama: Immerse. May be immerse, yes. You’re so immerse in devotion that … to as to what colour our devotion will take, but it will definitely take the colour which ever you gave Oh Mother to us, the devotion.
“Tum nirmal ho hma par kaya, nirmal rang ki chaya”.
You are pure Mother and we are asking you to give that pure colour. It also paradoxically means that nirmal is also white so you could colour us in pure white. It has been my thought that when we are in our white, we are so spotless, that even a small stain shows out. So the Sahajis have to be stainless, not still but stainless. [laughs]
“Tere rang me aise range ham, duja ran na lage”. Now, this is very difficult to explain. Again, we are so immerse in your colour, in you bhakti, “tere rang me aise range ham, duja ran na lage” nothing else we enjoy anymore, we don’t find-
Shri Mataji: Attraction.
Babamama: Attraction in anything. “Tum bin koi nazar na aae, in naino ke aage”. We do not perceive or see we don’t have the vision of anything, excepting you, oh Mother.
“Jala ko, thala ko sare jagata ko, banga ranga banaya”. The water or the oceans or the earth, or the entire cosmos, Mother you have paint it in you colour. This is what it says it is the best I could do in English. It means much more.
Babamama: It’s very difficult.
Shri Mataji: [ In Hindi?]..
What I was telling is that English is not such a deep language and it, sometimes, misses the point; that’s a fact.
