Tantrism, public program, Caxton Hall, London (UK), 21 November 1977.

My dear seekers,I’m thankful to Gavin Brown that he has been able to sum up some of the things I’ve said before and I don’t have to go into all the details of what I told you last time. Some of you have come for the first time here. [Tape interrupted].As he said, Tantra means the technique, it’s a technique. And Yantra, in Sanskrit language, means the mechanism. So, the technique of the mechanism.Now what is this mechanism we are talking about? Is there any mechanism outside or inside of us? Or is it worked through some subtle method? All these questions should come to our mind if you are seeking and if you are seeker. 

But I think that in the West people though are very much developed materially, they have sorted out many material questions and problems, they are very well equipped, but as far as the spiritual life is concerned, still, they are very naive.

Though they had such a great personality like Christ to follow, and what a model it was! But maybe because of an organized religion perhaps, it was not possible for people who were seeking truly to penetrate into it through meditative methods.So, this Tantra or the technique which works out our Self-realization is to be known, to be understood fully. And the Yantra that works out, you have already got. I’m thankful to Patrick who has made a beautiful sketch of that Yantra which is within you. It’s the instrument which is within you. But when we think of an instrument with our human mind, we cannot think of an instrument which is a living instrument. It is beyond our conception to understand a living machine. This one is a living instrument within you.When we see a tree sprouting out of a small little seed, working out its blossoming one has to know that there must be some technique or some mechanism that works out this beautiful tree to grow. And when we evolved from amoeba to this stage, we have to see there must be some mechanism which thinks, understands, organizes, loves, which has brought about this human stage from that amoeba stage.In ancient India, long time, people had lots of time. They went into themselves, into their being, through meditative understanding. They had a glimpse of this mechanism and they talked about it and wrote about it and that’s how this Yantra, the mechanism, and the Tantra, the manoeuvring of it, the technique of it, came into being. But it was a secret science. It was a very secret science and it was kept hidden from the general public.

It was used by very few great masters who lived in the jungles, had one or two disciples, worked on them for years together and taught them about the technique of the Divine. They had to leave everything, their family, everyone, live with the Guru, lead a completely celibate life and bring about a complete transformation under the guidance of their loving Gurus. This was in ancient times.And what did they achieved and what did they have? It’s all written in our scriptures. What do you expect out of Self-realization is written in the Bible, in the Koran, in the Torah and also in all the Indian philosophy.Only because we have that in some of these scriptures, it is written in a very secretive manner, under some words that, “I will appear before you as tongues of flames.” Now nobody’d know what ‘tongues of flames’ is. There are so many sentences which you can find out now when you go and read which nobody can explain unless and until they have had an experience of Kundalini.This is the Yantra, the mechanism, is the Kundalini, is a living force within you. It exists, it is there, it’s placed for your Realization, for your jumping into another awareness which is promised to you through various scriptures, through various incarnations. It is within you. Nobody told you lies. There is nothing but truth written in these books. But it was to be guarded. It was to be made into secret because people would have used it for their purposes. And they have despite all efforts.

First, I would like to speak about Self-realization because that is blissful and then I’ll tell you about the so-called tantrism. I have to talk about it though I have told about these things in the previous lecture because there are many that have been cheated.

I have now shown here all these centers and all the mechanism that is within us. They have also given you a picture of that, I have told you which are the deities sitting on all these different Chakras, as we call the centers, which have incarnated on this earth, have built up our being one by one gradually in different evolutionary processes and how we have become human beings, this I have told you last time.

This is the Yantra and the mechanism that is this Yantra, Kundalini, is a holy mechanism. And this mechanism is specially created within the being of the God’s Man, of the God’s Being, the Macrocosm and we are the cells – all of us – in that. We were made aware as fishes of the soil, we became reptiles. We were made aware of the food available at the heights, we raised our head. Gradually we became human beings.

After this state we started thinking of God. We started thinking on something beyond. Man is the only animal who thinks of God and of searching it. Is the man aware that he has to become something? Why is he so confused? Why is he under so tension? What did he search?He is searching something of which he has a glimpse – a glimpse of that joy he gets it and that joy comes from his Self – Atma – in his heart. He has not felt it, he has not been able to manifest the power of his Self. But there is a mechanism placed within him, properly built up inside, all the time present in all the human beings just like this as it is placed in the God’s Being. In His image, it is also placed within you.

As I said last time that you are all built to be just like computers. Now the job is to put you to the mains. That’s why you are seeking. That’s the only urge you have in life. All other urges are actually the side issues. You think you are searching in money, in position is a myth. Those who have money are dissatisfied, those who have positions are dissatisfied, everybody is dissatisfied. The satisfaction can only come to you when you will reach the real thing which you are searching. And the real thing is your Self and nothing else. All other things are useless because you are not searching anything else, you are only searching your Self and that Self is the reflection of God Almighty. That is within your heart.Now the mechanism that is placed within you is this beautiful thing inside which is placed inside your spinal cord and not outside. Except for the last chakra [Mooladhara] which is in the red colour that is outside, in the prostate. And this is a very, very important chakra which controls the cervical plexus within us, I’m sorry, the pelvic plexus within us. It is very important because it is very sensitive and also it is very delicate because it is placed outside the spinal cord.This mechanism that is placed outside the spinal cord, down below there, is the most important chakra and was created first. When the creation started this was the first thing that was created. And what does it emit? Holiness, innocence. It emits innocence. And the deity sitting on this, is the embodiment of innocence.

This deity was created in another dimension and he is, you have seen there, is Shri Ganesha. This is the image of Shri Ganesha that was created at that stage. And what does it represent? It’s the stage between the animal and the man and the head is that of the animal showing that an animal does not have any ego, that the man is different from an animal, that the animal is innocent, he doesn’t know what is sin, that’s why he is innocent. Because you know what is sin that’s why ‘you’ are innocent but you can become define, [unsure] contaminated. He is innocence personified. He said it. And He incarnates too on this earth. He incarnated as Jesus Christ, Lord Jesus Christ. He took His form as Lord Jesus-Christ and because He is innocent, He’s made of that essence of divine nature of God that we call as Paramatma [unsure], the highest essence of God. And that’s why His body is also made out of that and that is the reason He could resurrect it.

By reading Bible, which was written by disciples of Christ, how far can you go to understand Him? Because He was created beyond your thoughts, beyond your mind, in an unlimited Unconscious. And how can you, with your limited mind, understand Him or copy Him? It is said that, "Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh cannot reach Him. He is so pure". He is purity. He is innocence and He exists at that point and it is He at every point, every chakra He bestows upon you the blessings of innocence. Innocence was the first thing created on this Earth.Before creating anything else it was innocence all everywhere. And He bestows that innocence by which you get your Self-realization.

On the left-hand side of this mechanism there are seven strata. On the right-hand side there are seven strata, down below there are seven strata and on top there are seven strata. What are these strata and what do they reach in you?The left-hand side chakras, the left-hand side channel which is called as Ida channel represents the subconscious, the subconscious mind within you. You listen to Me through your conscious mind and put it back into the subconscious mind. All your experiences go into the subconscious. That is the limit of your subconscious of present here. Beyond that goes, is your subconscious of previous lives and beyond that goes, is the collective subconscious.

When you listen to Me you have got a conscious mind which receives it at this moment and there is a pre-conscious mind which takes it to the subconscious. This pre-conscious mind is on the right-hand side. This also has got seven strata on this side. Just now the pre-conscious mind is the future that you are thinking about. Beyond that is the supra-conscious mind, means all the ideas about future you have had before, many lives before. Those ideas are there. And beyond that is the collective supra-conscious mind.So, on the left-hand side you have sub-conscious and the collective sub-conscious; on the right-hand side: supra-conscious and the collective supra-conscious mind.Down below are the seven strata of Hell. H.E.L.L. Sometimes the words are so small that it doesn’t register in your mind. If I say ‘Supra-conscious’, then people say, “Ah! Mataji has said ‘supra-conscious’.” But ‘Hell’, and Hell is a truth. It exists within us! It is there. And there are seven strata of that also.

Conscious mind also has got seven strata which are built in within us through our different evolutionary processes. And these are the seven strata which are placed here of the conscious mind and then you go on top of the head into Super-conscious mind, which is the subtle mind, is the eternal mind, the Unconscious in which you have to move in seven strata. You say, "Mataji it’s too much!" But it’s not. You are already built-in for that.For example, if I tell this light, "You have to get enlightened and cover the whole hall", it will say, "Oh! It’s too much." No, it is built like that. You have to just press the button. It opens and works because it is built that way, has been organized that way, is placed that way, that it works.

When we face things that we think difficult, we think we have to do it and that’s why you are worried, you don’t have to worry: it’s already done! And it will be done also by the One who is organizing it. Only thing what you have to do, is to witness. The One who has created this universe, where you there? The One who has created all the greenery then human being where you there? He is the One who is going to do this for you and the time has come, as Gavin has said it beautifully, that the blossom time has come and it will work out with you.But it surprises Me, you know, human beings sometimes I cannot understand. When I told them that, "It is going to work out" they said, "How can it be? It has to be difficult". Before even starting about it, must you sit down with this idea on your head, "Oh! It’s going to be very difficult". I say, "It is the easiest and the simplest thing. Being so important it cannot be difficult". Anything important like your breathing, if it becomes difficult and if you have to read about breathing, "How am I to breathe?" Now you go into books and see, "Now, you have to do like this". By the time you take the book, you are out.

If you have to read about your Self-realization then God saves the Self-realization and God saves you. It’s your right that you are going to get your Self-realization. I’m not pampering your ego. But that’s how you have been made. Even your ego, which you are condemning every morning and evening, was an essential part of the seeking. Only you the human beings have evolved the ego to know something on their own.

So, this mechanism was made specially in such a manner that through your ego and your superego you have become an ‘I’ personality. Like people say, "This is Mister Kumar. This is X, this is Y". You become a separate identity from that big, vast personality of which you are just as that. And the consciousness of that comes to you, that you are a separate identity and you have to see the oneness with that. And that is what is Self-realization. Nothing else!That you become that. Not what you do, but it’s the becoming of that. Like you say, a seed becomes a flower. It becomes a flower. You don’t – the seed doesn’t go and read a book, "Oh! I know what it is". Or it doesn’t listen to any lecture of Mataji or anything, it just becomes a flower. In the same way, you have to become that. And not to just to be brain-washed or to be done something else which I will tell you later, how per misuse you can do, in the name of Self-realization. [Shri Mataji laughs.] So many of them are aware of it. So, they know that.Now what happens you can know it, what is the mechanism, how it works out, let us see the positive side of it. And then I will tell you the negative side.

There is a Kundalini placed in that triangular bone there, you can see it pulsate. We have a doctor here he will say that, "Yes, he has seen it". You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini very clearly. You can see the rising of the Kundalini very clearly with your naked eyes. You can also feel it coming up. It comes. How it comes? How it works out? It’s another detailed program which I may be able to tell you later on or I have already told quite a lot about it.This comes up – the Kundalini – and pierces your fontanel bone, pierces! What is this Kundalini? It is a residual force within you. Is awareness which understands, thinks, loves and organizes, it’s an energy.

Now we cannot think, human beings cannot think of an energy that can think, love, organize. We cannot. This is the energy that comes up, you can see the pulsation. You can see the bringing of it with your naked eye, that’s wat you can believe. It comes up and pierces your fontanel bone and you can feel the baptism that you become like a child because your fontanel bone becomes very soft. I mean, but that doesn’t mean that if you have a soft bone here, that doesn’t mean that you are a Self-realized person. No. When you enter not on left side or right-hand side but when you enter onto the top, onto the first strata of the Super-consciousness, then what happens? First thing that should happen to you, is that you become one with the Collective Being. "You become", again I say. It is not lecturing, "We are all brothers and sisters. There should be no racism". All this is lecturing. I’m not saying lecturing. It becomes. How?When this thing enters through this into that subtle form, you start feeling from your hands a cool breeze flowing. This is described in our scriptures. If you read even Christ has said, "Something passed out of My body when somebody touched Me". [Luke 8.46]

But in our scriptures, it’s given very, very clearly. Here, in some of them, for example, I would say Shankara. Shankaracharya described that as Saundarya Lahari. He called it as Saundarya Lahari’s force somewhere else. He called them vibrations. Everybody, people are talking of vibrations but they don’t know what they’re talking.These vibrations that flow from your hand are cool vibrations and also, they understand, they think and heal other people. When you put your hand towards another person, you start suddenly getting a burning here. Left-hand side burning on this finger is the Vishuddhi chakra, is this one. Now, if you know the deity who is there, and if you take the name of that particular deity who is sitting here, if you know and if you are a Realized soul, then only. If you are not Realized you have no authority. You have no authority to take to any mantra unless and until you are a Realized soul.

Supposing I give you some mantra. You must know it is a misleading, because whatever is said, whatever is the center in danger or in trouble, you must get that one. The one who is not a Realized soul cannot make out what is the problem, where is the problem. And the one who is not Realized, if he is given the mantra, his mantra has no authority. Like, if I want to go and see the Queen, I must take a permission. I must have some connection with her. I should be able to go and meet her. But if I go and meet her straight and say, "Oh! Queen, come along".

The way we call God sometimes is most surprising. You wouldn’t even call any servant like that the way we call Him, "God, come along! Do this. This is my problem. What are you doing for me?""I have faith in God" as if we have, sort of, we are getting obligations. As if He is obliged to us, "Oh! I have faith in God, Mother, then why did he miss it? " Who has faith? I mean, He exists. He’s an eternal being. If you have faith in that, you are ready for fight, not ‘He’. You cannot add to His Dom [unsure].Any mantra is given to you just by any Dick, Tom and Harry. Anyone coming, "I’ll give you a mantra". I mean to tell you about them later on. All those mantras that are said are for the deities, were done by these Gurus as I told you in ancient times for very few people. They used to raise the Kundalini very gradually. They used to take it from their seat which is the Mooladhara – not the Mooladhara chakra – from that triangular bone and they used to raise it one by one.For seven years, it used to hang into one center then they would give one mantra, "All right, now, go on with it! Work it out! Cleanse it! Do it! " Then again, another chakra. Then again, another chakra. All right. It has been done like that: very slow process.

As in India, you see, they said that when they had to go to Kashi or Benares, they used to sell out their houses, everything. And they knew that they may never return. Or even if they go, they might take so many years to reach Benares that by that time they will be absolutely old people and they would not have energy to return. Now, if you have to go to Benares, only thing what you can do is to go from here to Delhi and take a plane and go directly.So that time is over and Kundalini now can be worked out just like that, because the time has come for you to get it.

There were never so many seekers in the world before I can tell you this. Only people who existed in the name of religion were Orthodox, Arabic, horrible people who crucified Christ, who killed Muhammad Sahib, who tortured Dnyaneshwara, who tortured Kabira, who tortured of all the things, Shankaracharya. Buddha, Mahavira, you read anyone of them. All these horrid people in the name of religion tortured. And today now, we have got these satanic people coming out of that Hell. They have suffered there, you see, they were punished and after their punishment they are coming out with a double force with a new subtler method of befooling you people.

In Self-realization you get bliss, complete bliss, tranquillity, the Collective Consciousness and you can manoeuvre this power yourself. It is ‘your’ power that is manifested and nobody else’s but you. As you have been to all these satanic people – most of you have been. Last time I saw that and when I told them, you see, they tried. As I’m working very hard, you know, I’m working very hard. But some of them have really spoiled their path of Sushumna, the central path. So badly they have spoiled it, that unless and until they give up all that, it’s not going to work out.If you are truly seeking, I’m there to work for you. You don’t have to pay any money for it. No, never think of that because this is divine and divine cannot be sold in the market.

First thing that should come into your head as Christians specially that Christ has taken a hunter in his hand and started beating those people. That’s the only time He really lost his temper on them when they were selling the religion. And today all of them are selling it and you very, very humbly go and bow.All kinds of these beggars and parasites have come in this country and all over the Western countries. They are nothing but beggars take it from me. Worse than beggars they are the worst culprits.So, this is what Self-realization is and in Self-realization you get all the blessings of God, gradually you go into thoughtless awareness and then into doubtless awareness which we call Nirvikalpa and then into Self-realization completely. In that we have some people in India – they have met them – who are completely Self-realized and who, sitting down there, can work out the Kundalini of other people. They are living in the family. They have got their children. They have got their grand-children. And they are working it out.

You don’t have to run away from that, no extremes are needed, nothing. It is ‘within you’ and ‘within you’ it is going to work out. These outside things and these extreme things are not needed. Just be normal people. God has created this world for you to enjoy! It is for your enjoyment. It is his blessings that you have to feel through Self-realization. When the light of the Self flows in, you see the joy pouring. You see it pouring from your head downwards and you are just drenched. All your tensions go. All your problems go away.The ego and superego which he has shown here, as the black and the yellow, both of them open up and you see they’re going down. It happens. There is an imbalance, there is a – some sort of a – hurt in you. Sometimes I can say there could a very great wound into you, could be there are some spies sitting in you, could be that you are possessed without knowing that you are possessed.

You don’t know how these people have manoeuvred and I hope I will be able to tell you now how they have manoeuvred and what sort of horrid people they are. I think I should take off my shoes perhaps.

Works out better.

So, about these horrid people now.

In India, since long, if you say the origin of so-called tantrism which is just the opposition of real tantra which is Sahaja Yoga, of the genuine tantra. If tantrism is to be considered as a genuine stuff, then it is Sahaja Yoga.But this tantrism, this so-called – came into being in our country since long. Ancient times when these Gurus were having those few disciples with them, three, four disciples were taken with great difficulty. But they were, after all, human beings. They used to be competition with them. And Guru would accept only one out of them or two out of them, would take them a little ahead and would then leave them out saying that, "No. We cannot treat you anymore. You cannot be helped. You’d better go away".

Such a useless, half-baked person would come down to the public and would start a method by which he would put up a show against these fools. This is the beginning, I would say. So, he would now sit down and meditate.Still, you know, as a Mother, I don’t want to condemn all of them. I will give them a benefit of doubt and the benefit of doubt is this: that when they were concentrating, they tried to leak into their Mooladhara chakra, which you cannot enter in, which is below the Kundalini. This Mooladhara chakra controls the sex. Why? Because it is innocent. It’s a child and the child doesn’t understand sex that’s why it is not contaminated by it. It is like a lotus coming out of the mud of sex.

In that lotus sits Shri Ganesha. These people tried to peep into that thinking that through sex, they might be able to see him. And they might have seen - this is my own way of putting it – not him completely but his trunk as you see it. And they might have confused it – still I say – that trunk to be the Kundalini.When I tried to understand human beings, I thought this may have been. Because how could man be just entering into hell directly with all understanding? It’s too much to Me. So, by mistake maybe, that they saw this. All right?

So, first the Tantrikas came in. Tantrikas were the first. Then we have Tantrikas – basically I’m telling you- these evil geniuses are. In the fact, you see, you cannot divide them into all details, but you can give a basic broad outline about them.

The Tantrikas. Tantrikas are the people who use sex for so-called Self-realization. Mantrikas are the people who use mantras for so-called Self-realization.Then there are Chandadikas [unsure] who use evil geniuses to be introduced as evil spirits into human beings – called as Chandadikas. Then Paishachikas are the people who used supraconscious devils into human beings. They are over dynamic, over ambitious sort of people. We have got Abhogis [unsure] who taught them to put, say, they can put a, put a dagger into their hands, you see, Abhogis. Then we have got [Begeals?] [Begeals?] are the people who can do horrible, horrible gestures, you see, they can pull their stomach in, push it here, push it there, all sorts of things they do. And we have also Sexo-yogis. Minimum. I have categorized them as that. But I don’t know how many styles of things there are. Because when it comes to evil they come and prosper like this. Viruses they are. And they know how to hit you off. They themselves are destroying, they cannot see you constructing. They cannot see you evolve. That is one of the basic reasons where they are out as all these.

So, these Tantrikas first started their job. In the Rama’s time, say about twelve thousand years back, there was a Yajna, a kind of ceremony known as Ashvamedha. It’s written in the books about that. Even that, the books, the scriptures they ruined by saying that Ashvamedha, there was nothing else but a sex act. The Shakti and Shiva, which is God who is innocent and His power the Shakti,  like light and the lamp or the sun and the sunlight. There also they introduced the symbol of sex.

This happened in the sixth century. Tantrism  was at its height  in our country, a complete bent  was taken.  Satjakuna [?], in Khajuraho  too. People  were influenced so much that all other scriptures were thrown into the rivers and tantrism became the scripture of the Hindus.

Thank God,  organized religion at least  would not allow people to tamper too much with the Bible. Though  it was, but not so much. It could have been (worse). There is so much freedom, license to do whatever you please with that scripture.

Can you imagine? From this scripture they started spoiling in the sixth century. Now what was the historical background for that?

That was the best time, the best breeding time for  these horrible people. Because at that time,  there were very extreme types of orthodox people .  Now we have a sect of people called Jainism .   Horrid. I mean, all of them are. But one of the  horrid things I can tell you is that they believe in vegetarianism to such an extent!  They do not want to destroy even the insects that are in the filth.  (tape interrupted)

(...)They will pay someone a lot of money to be locked up with  lots of bugs so that they can bite him and take out his blood . It is a fact. Even today they do it sometimes in the villages. They think it’s the greatest punya, absolutely  the greatest. What do you say ‘Tapoyajna’ means? Punya. It is a good deed, you see. It is a religious deed to make a man get inside a hut for  bugs to  come and  take the blood. So, these Jains – so-called vegetarians, horrid – they were the ministers you know. Somehow,  they became ministers.  And the maharajas – you know the word ‘raja’ is for the King – were the Hindus. And Hindus as usual are very indifferent to religion.

Whatever one may say about it, I agree  that India is a very great country  but Hindus these days are even worse because now, they have all become English, you see. With English education all of them have become English. Westernized. They don’t think we have anything in our country.

So, these  great Rajas who are so indifferent to religion, to their sustaining power, to understand what is in their scriptures, who are licentious and permissive like your Roman kings, horrible  Rajas, once they used  their money to make some sort of an arrangement for all the licentious people around.  They thought of a very ingenious method, you see:  to build the temple of God and make all kinds of erotic pictures in the temple. Can you believe such a  thing? In the name of art. If art is pure as people say, why do you need this vulgarity? Horrible erotic things were created through big competitions.

Now you  have  competitions in this country but at that time – of course now you are also becoming tantrikas as far as erotic things are concerned – one better than the other. And they were given special prizes es, even jagirs – as they call  lands – were given to those people – it’s written in history books  – for creating those pictures. Despite that, you see, despite all that provocation  and despite all that temptation , you’ll be amazed, t that is how Konaraka art  started.

There has been another thing, a simple thing. It is not. We are ‘not’ going to do it. In a temple we are ‘not’ doing it.” So, these clever intelligent people, you see, they told them that, “If you do this, it will be good because all the dirt that is here should be placed outside   you see, and inside should be clean. Outside we must accept before  God that we are like this.”

This is a concession. See the brain, “This is a concession you must make:  all the dirty  things you are doing you put them out there.”

This was the  historical side here. And at  that time these tantrikas came, who were absolutely horrid. You have only one Soho. We have Sohos and Sohos and Sohos in that great country.

You won’t believe it when you see those things, you know, foreigners are surprised that in India there are such erotic things . Wherever there is religion, wherever there is a saint, these satanic people have to  go  there to destroy all that is pure. That is their style, their “happiness”. This is a crucifixion of purity. .

And such temples were created and those tantrikas then came forward. They brought about all their women there for Konaraka. If you go there is the Chausath Bhavani Mandir, they call it “the sixty-four goddesses”. Imagine, the Goddesses’ temple!

Now what do they do? Now what is the principle behind all that, you must know. It is a very secretive principle that they use. They establish the picture of a Goddess or create a statue of a Goddess in a chapel and before the Goddess they do nirvicara, means sex act of sixteen  different types. Horrible! In the beginning Shri Ganesha gets angry. They get all kinds of blisters all over. They  say that the Kundalini is angry. Why  will the Kundalini  be angry? It is Shri Ganesha who is angry, but in such a temper that from the right and the left  they get  blisters. They start dancing, jumping, they behave like frogs, they have horrid things. They get blasted in the head, they get headaches, everything they get. But still they are adamant because it is said that, “You have to go further. It’s a terrible task, it’s a difficult task. These are your Karmas that are coming to torture you. You have to take out your Karmas. Through your sex you do better Karmas or bad Karmas.” So, they go on poor people.

Then, what is more, by doing that, what happens is the deities slip off, they go away from there. The area is built-in. The realm of God disappears from there  just as light disappears in the darkness. They work in the night; they’ll never work in the daytime. In the night they work and then they call the spirits. You can call them. Last time I told you what happens to you when you die and how the spirits are there and what  the horrible spirits are that are hanging around  to enter into you. So, I will not go into the details of that but later on I’ll tell you all about it. I’ll tell you each and everything. You note it down.

So, they start, they call the spirits. When they call the spirits – spirits have  lust in them, greed, they’re greedy, you see, really dissatisfied – and they maneuver  them. They can give them the name of say ‘Rama’, then ‘Aim’, ‘Hrim’, ‘Klim’, all sorts of names they can give to these spirits, these evil geniuses manage them.  Then they put these spirits on the king, onto his main  ministers and these people are captured and possessed. And they say, “We are very erotic. We  used to run after only two women, now we are running after hundreds of women.” Mad!

They lose all their sense of Self. They have no understanding of what they are doing. They behave like madmen. . Even some saints can be affected but they get reactions physically.  If saints  indulge in this, immediately they get reactions. They get reactions in the head, in the body. And the reactions could be very strong on them. Sometimes they vomit too much.

So ‘these’ people start putting that  horrible sex  on you, capturing you, taking out your being.

In India there was a tantrika like that who amassed lots of money but his wife threw  him  out and he built that horrible temple of  Konaraka [Temple near Puri]. If he had not put any erotic images  there it would have been a beautiful temple but with all that erotism  you feel like vomiting all the time when you go. I mean, if you are healthy, you just can’t bear to see that  kind  of bathroom, the way it is done. Tomorrow they will ask us to watch these people sitting down there for the morning ablutions! Filth and filth and filth! The whole place is nothing but filth.

And then his own son defied him, this horrible tantrika. This tantrika was killed in a very funny manner: it  is worth reading how he was killed. And the son came down and he completed that temple [In legends the architect’s son committed suicide jumping from the top of the temple.] but he told the King that, “Your kingdom will disappear.”

All these  kings disappeared once and for all. They had no children, they had nothing, they became just down and outs and all of their temples were covered with stones,  they were just mounding of earth. Later on, the English came there and some of them excavated and found out. They found it artistic, I don’t know how they found it but it was there. But in Konaraka you will find the whole thing is so vulgar, so horrid, where the artists – poor things – had nothing to say. And I met the artists of that place who are living  nearby. . They said, “We  have been  paying all our lives  for what our forefathers  did   and we don’t want to see that.”

Even today in India an unmarried man and an unmarried woman will never go to see a Konaraka. Now the only explanation they have is this, you’ll be amazed, that after marriage Indian women are so innocent as  they’re married quite young.  They  don’t understand what  sex is, so this art teaches them  what  sex is. It is made for  married couples  and only the husband and wife should go there. This is the only explanation our Indian artists could find  to give for that.

But we have to accept. You see, in every country there could be a satanic force working. Why should we identify ourselves with those horrible tantrikas and why should we be ashamed of that? In Khajuraho, the other tantric place, you will see  there are some places where you find eroticas. But if you are alert and if you pay attention, these are kept in corners somewhere while the gods and goddesses  have large statues and so on, they are a great attraction   So it never comes to your notice unless and until you are taken to it and shown  that this is an erotica.

But surprisingly most of the foreigners are especially Japanese  with  their cameras clicking  from this angle and that. Why don’t they take their own photographs like that? Why  go all the way to Konaraka to take those photographs? Shows what you are seeking ! Shows what you are asking for! The way people from here  take  those big – big – cameras all the way there and go round. They take photographs  from  various angles. What is there to take photographs of ? In that what is there to gain? Sex, animals know, everybody knows, a dog knows. What is there to teach about sex? You have done so much of  it mentally that now there will be impotency. And you know that the highest number of cases of impotence are  in America  because of this kind of perversion and ruining your innocence within. .

Beware of it! This so-called freedom is nothing but the  abandonment of your sustenance, of  the  Dharma that is within you. It is  built-in. It is there. It exists. You cannot  ignore , “Thou shall not commit adultery.” Christ has said, “Not only adultery but I will say, ‘Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.” And you see people, all the time they... And they say, “We are intelligent.” What  happened? Where are you looking? What  are you seeing? Where is your attention?

This human attention has been built up through the ages . So much has been worked out. You have been brought from that level to this level today. Where are you going ? Into gutters, into filth, into dirt.

Rise! And see your glory. Have  self-respect. As a Mother, I tell you that. And these horrible tantrikas and Mantrikas who are teaching you all kinds of things like putting a mandala – the other day somebody told Me – and putting your sex there. What is a mandala? Don’t you know it is the aura of God? You are showing your sex to God! Have some brains at least if nothing else. It’s the  most  shameful thing you are doing if you show your sex organs  to God. Are you all lunatics? Can’t you understand? It’s a ceremony!

I get upset about this  because you don’t know. You will lose all your chances of Realization. Your seeking is going to be lost completely, believe Me.

Stand in your own glory. Why should you run after women? Why should you run after men? If you are a glorious person, stand in your own image. That’s the best way you are going to be a human being.

This kind of licentiousness and permissiveness is going to completely finish that chakra in the Nabhi. You see that this one has got ten petals which are built so carefully, delicately, beautifully, with love. Do not confuse love with licentious behavior. It is not. It’s sanctified love. I don’t say you become sannyasin, not at all, I’m against that also, another extreme.

Then I’m going to tell you about sexo-yogis, the third type. . The sexo-yogis start as  people who are suppressing their sex. They do not marry. (Tape interruption) They use  the skull of a lady. They need skulls for that. To be in the subconscious you have to have a skull. So, they kill people, take out their skulls and keep it with them.

So,  they keep those skulls with them and those skulls they use for drinking water, for eating food, all the time these skulls are there.

Now there is a very good story written by a great writer in India, Bankim Chandra [Chattopadhyay],  known as Kapal Kundala. A Kapali [Mahadji?] used to make a girl  nude,  make her dance,  make her go in the sea  and used to control his sex sitting before her. And there are  also several sexual acts he would control . He went on like that and ultimately, he wanted  to kill that girl. That is the height of complete abstinence because you kill the person whom you were supposed to have. Just imagine, what perversion! What a brain! What habits! I mean there’s no limit to this. God has not given you freedom to break your head and to say that, “Oh, bull come and hit me!”

And this girl was preserved and then somehow  or other she ran away and she got married to a man. He visited her, brought her back and killed her.

These are the Kapali. If you don’t listen to them, they will take you to the smashana that is the burial ground, cut your head off, take out your skull and keep it. They will see to it that you go to the subconscious strata and they handle you better there. They would like to die through their stamina. They do it. So many of them are doing that. . Even today, you have no idea. And people are so much enamored, so obsessed by  these things that  even if you tell them that your gurus are doing like this and they have found out, still they will be there to kill you. Absolutely rabid people. They are possessed, brain-washed completely. And if some people  could be saved, to say ... I always say that if a sari keeps flying out, even if you could hold a little bit of it, we can save this sari.

The sanity must come to you to understand that these horrible methods are not going to give you Self-realization. You must know what  Self-realization is.

Now some people think that flying in the air, jumping somewhere is something great. Which incarnation did that ? Did you hear of any incarnation  who sat like this and was floating in the air? Which incarnation did that and what are you going to gain  by  floating in the air? You are going to create a problem with the  traffic. Why do these nonsensical things?  ? In Puna [Shivapur], they say there is one saint who died, you see, and there is a stone there. If ten  people take the name of the saint, it can come up. And you can  touch it with your finger, it can come up. I said, “With that what could God  do?” Think of it! And when I went there, I found out that there was a big spirit sitting there and he said, “I’m going to sit down here Mother. I’m not going to do anything” And the spirit of that horrible fellow is all the time sitting there. He doesn’t want anything. He just wants to meet good people and sit down there and listen to everybody taking his name , calling him a saint.  He is not a saint. Why  should we accept that he is a saint and be happy with it? Because human beings can do anything. They have been given that power.

And moreover, God is powerless before you because He cannot take away your freedom to be idiots or to be foolish or to be self-destroying. He cannot do it. He can only weep and cry, beg  you, “Please don’t do it, please don’t do it”, but He cannot stop it. That’s the only problem. And that’s why all of them have taken you. They have all come from somewhere like spiders. At least I know fifteen of them. And three horrible women. They’re all there making money, making money, befooling you.

Why do you need a guru  to tell  you a mantra? Any  Tom, Dick and Harry can tell you. You must see the result, the proof. What’s  the outcome  of  this ? You must think. You are intelligent people. You understand everything, why don’t you understand this, “I’m possessed.” Are you  completely obsessed with  such people? Or perhaps you have paid them so much money that you think, “Oh  we have paid so much now that  we should  go  through with the whole thing.” Like when you go to the theatre  and you don’t like the play,  but as  you have paid for it, ,  you stay.

It’s not that casual. It’s a very serious thing. You are going into the den of devils, finishing your Kundalini completely.

Now there are at least twenty-five people among you who will say that it has happened to them. I’ve been correcting them. I’m doing it. They are getting it back. I only feel sorry for one thing, that you have been genuine about your seeking. You have been genuinely seeking and I can assure you that I went to America in 1970 to warn  you but at that time  all of them were suffering from a  special type of possession . They would not listen to Me. I told Ravi Shankar. He said, “Mother you just don’t go near them. They will eat you out.” They  were  out to have experiences of  fulsome drugs.

In India how many people have seen the drugs – ask them, anyone of them ? Ha! Do they even know what is the difference between bhang and this and that? These drugs and all these things were used by tantrikas. And now they are out here. They have brought  them here.

Things that go against your awareness whether they are drugs or alcohol,  , nothing is  going to give you that higher awareness about which I’m  talking.  Don’t waste your life. It’s very precious. The most precious and the greatest time has come. Please respect yourself. And please understand your value. What you have learned before, find it out and do not waste it. You have already wasted a lot of your time.

I told you the seven stratas on the left and right have names which I think I have no time to tell you but there are names and names and names for everything. Hakini, Rakini, Lakini, Shakini, like that, on the left-hand side. This side is Gayatri and Savitri and all that sort of thing. It goes on both the sides. All these are nothing but  resonances. They throw you from one to another strata. You are sort of tested in every strata and when they find  you are a gone case you go ‘direct’ into hell. These are all achieved!

So, I have to make a very simple statement.  Keep your Self, respect your Self. Try. If it works with you, well and good. I’m here to work out the raising of the Kundalini,  bringing it out. You yourself  will  be able to do it after some time but cleansing is needed and it should never be given up because there is no way out.

Nanak – Guru Nanak – he has written at least three or four chapters against these tantrikas and Mantrikas and these [pishachis?] paishakshikas and these Jains. In India  these names are  a form of abuse   – I mean  it is the  first time I have used these words for that. – it is an insult  to call somebody like this. If you say that to someone, they will take you to  court. They are kept outside like lepers. Kabira has written books after books. These khecharis and this and that he lashed them left and right, He was a great poet. Everybody fought with him, tortured him.

Christ was the same. He is the one who said not to go towards spirits at all. This is all  to do with spirits. . But  in London, in every fifth house there  is a spiritualist sitting , “Free hypnotics!” Why do you want to get hypnotized? Why do you want to get E.S.P – what they call – Extra Sensory Perception? All these so-called geniuses also, these prodigies are also possessed. I’ve seen many prodigies. One of them came to Me. I told her, “All right, in My presence you calculate.” She could not calculate even one  because I put a bandhan to her possession. I said, “You get out!”

I’ve had many such experiences which I can tell you. Last time I told  you how people who are possessed came to Me and how they  left. .

Now there is still time and we can move into Self-realization experience. It  might take  some people  five minutes but  for some it will be  more. In any case you must have patience. And don’t be angry with yourself.  As Gavin said  –  if it is not Ego then the Superego comes, “We are the worst people, we are the horrible people. We...” you see, from one extreme to another.

You have to stand in-between. You are glorious. You are neither  an aggressor nor  are you  taking aggression from anyone. You stand within your Self and through that you have your own powers.

You don’t have to depend on anyone or anything. You just are. But you have to depend on the deities that are within you, which I’m going to see. There has been a problem. They have to be corrected and you have to know where the deities are.

In Sahaja Yoga – modern Sahaja Yoga I may call it – there is no mantra given. No. Because every second the Kundalini is going like that. Now there are people who’ll say, “This I can tell you, this I can tell you.” It is here they saw that. You must have seen she came to Me. She tells Me that, “Mother I’ve caught that.” All right, finished. Agnya catching. So, nobody is given a mantra but you know where the catch is. You yourself say. She herself came and told Me, “I’ve got caught on Agnya.” And you know what extreme Agnya catching means, you know: paranoia. But she doesn’t mind telling Me because she sees herself away from herself and she told Me, “I’ve got an Agnya clearly.” All of them say, “The Agnya is there. I can see those coming inside me.” He told Me that, “I can see these entities now coming into me.” And I throw them away and they have a nice – a nice program. If you all talk to them, they will tell you their experiences. Some of them went into a trance; I had to take them out.

So many things happen now. People just like you came to Me and gained. And you’ll also gain but be sensible about it, be wise. Be wise. You have to expect gains and nothing else.  You will find nothing else.

So, may God bless you.

You can go into a little meditation just by putting your hands towards Me and if you could take out your shoes it would be better. It works better because the Mother Earth’s there and she helps no doubt. All the elements help you. They’re all around. You see, it was very cold in the street. At this time, it’s not so cold. All the elements are there to help you. It was extremely cold and now it is so nice. You can take off your coats and you’ll be all right.
