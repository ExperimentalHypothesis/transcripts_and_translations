Since ancient ages, Man has been in search of ‘TRUTH’ , this search lead humans to live in (penance) in difficult Terrance right from Snowy mountains to deep dense forests. Bharat (India) the sacred Holy land has always been the land of the true seekers.

In their seeking, they understood, Universes are run by infinite energy which is a fraction of the Supreme energy and is the prime source of all creations and existence, this energy they named as ‘Adi Shakti’. Adi Shakti is the Primordial infinite power of God Almighty’s love which human race experiences in every moment of their lives.

Once drenched in God’s love, in completed surrender and in Joy of the spirit, the Soul dedicates itself to One ness with God and this is called Yoga.

Nachiketa and Markendaya went through rigorous penance and gained this Divine knowledge in their childhood. Lord Shri Krishna gave the knowledge on every form of Yoga; this path of spiritual practice continues to inspire humanity.

In the quest for Joy and Peace, this TRUTH is only achieved through pure devotion.

All the great incarnations who came on the earth and all the religions that were formed, all the paths that emerged, all the Saints, Seers, all were mere creations of pure faith which cannot be denied.

They learnt, going beyond rituals, protocols and traditional customs practiced through centuries, all eventually directed towards the essence of Motherly energy which symbolizes humanity.

This is the fundamental essence, described by Gurus in their speeches (words) and is spread across in every religious scripture and Book written by Saints.

Gyaneshwar ji the Great Saint of Maharashtra did an excellent task of conveying the divine knowledge in simple and beautiful Marathi language for common people, these details are beautifully explained in 6th chapter of Gnaneshwari. 

Once this divine light of knowledge is kindled in the Heart, Man attains multi-dimensional progress, today it might look impossible to attain this state of balance which encompasses internal and external transformation, however this dream of Guru Rabindranath Tagore has become reality (embraced) in Westen land of Bharat.

Shri Mataji: There is a big inner revolution coming up, which is silent, joyous, and is going to change the whole humanity.

This TRUTH (living process), Knowledge was very well described in ‘Saundarya Lahari’ by Adi Guru Shankaracharya and in a simple manner it has been experienced by common people.

In different parts of the world Doctors are using this knowledge to treat incurable diseases.

Doctor: I have been involved with Sahaj Yoga, the work of Shri Mataji, for about the past 10 years, during that time I have seen a lot of people who have had a whole variety of problems. A lot of them psychosomatic, but that means all, some illness that we would normally regard as purely physical. And I have seen many cures, I don’t think that’s too strong word and certainly on the whole, people who practice Sahaj Yoga do report very mart increase in their general good health and well-being.

In India, many doctors are leveraging this divine knowledge for good purpose. In Russia this knowledge is considered beyond science.

Shri Mataji: So, everything is so balanced in nature. And the Almighty has created only one world. Only we human beings have divided it and move like criminals with our passports in our hands.

Breaking the boundaries of countries, religions, languages and race, today this knowledge is spreading its fragrance across 56 counties of the world.
