I bow to all the seekers of truth. These are exceptional times. There are thousands and thousands people born on this earth who have been seeking the truth for many lives. It is a very special category of personality. As a result of this, people started the seeking in various ways of the unknown. But whatever is unknown is not the truth. This is the problem in the West, that we are not knowledgeable about the roots on which we stand. The knowledge is in the West is that of the tree and not of the roots. And that is why many people have taken full advantage of this naivety. From 1970 I’ve been speaking very loudly against all such people who have come to the West to delude you, how they have tried to loot you and to give you diseases and troubles of incorrigible nature.

In the beginning when I talked against them, people here were protesting vehemently and they were so badly mesmerized that I could not rescue them. Such people, we can say, form real cults. But the truth has to be in the line of evolutionary process. It has to have the bases. It cannot just come from somewhere and people say, “This is a method,” or, “This is a way it is to be done.” As you know, in the Vedas it is described thousands of years back that Kundalini is the One which gives you realization. Patanjali Shastras also describes it fully. Recently, we would say, about sixteenth-seventeenth century we had a great poet in India who elaborately spoke about the Kundalini awakening. In the Bible it is called as “tree of fire” and in the Koran it is called as “asas”.

Translator: In?

Shri Mataji: In the Koran. In all the religious Scriptures it is said that the time has to come when you must get your Self-realization, your second birth. But it appeals to right-sided people, as I call them – the people who live with the ego more – to accept some sort of a new knowledge, which may not have any relationship whatsoever with the traditional evolutionary knowledge.

Now, when I went to Poona very recently I met lots of Brahmins of Poona were suffering from terrible diseases of heart, of kidneys, high blood pressure, tensions, and other diseases of muscular disability. They all told Me they were following a particular guru called guru Vani. The name itself means “hotchpotch” in our language. The guru is no more now, but his disciple, the chief disciple, I wanted to meet him, and when he came to see Me I asked him “What were you doing?” So he said, “Have you heard about Arunopaye, Tarunopaye, Karunopaye?” Funny names. I said, “I’ve never heard. What are these names from? Which Shastras?” Then he said, “Have you heard about Shaktipath?” I said, “Never. From where did you learn this word?” They said, sixty years back, somebody called Vishnutirth has written a book in which he has described this new method of meditation. And in the same book it is written that when your Kundalini is awakened you start jumping like a frog.
Now these Brahmins are very well-educated, highly intellectual in India, who know lot of things about Sanskrit also. So I asked them, “Are you going to become a frog now?” So he said, “No, the book says you have to pass through all the yonis, all the other stages. Again you have to become a frog, then a lion, then this, that and everything. And then you become a human being and then a super human being.” Such absurd things were readily accepted by these so-called intellectuals. They were all possessed people and suffering from terrible, physical diseases. So the cult is like this which comes in opposition to everything that is said before, and something new, like a fashion, it starts. And the ego-oriented people are never individualistic because they have no personality of their own. If they see somebody is wearing a dress like this, immediately they start wearing like that.

Now there is another kind of misfortune the seekers have faced. That is the so-called organized religions. Now when you see the religions, you are amazed how these people are religious cutting each other’s throats. Even the Christians who came to India had Bible in one hand and a revolver in the other. These Christians went all round the world killing thousands and thousands of aboriginals in all the countries, supposed to be following Christ who died for them. I went to Argentina and I wanted to meet one aboriginal personality, one. But they said there, “We don’t have any. If You want to see, You can go to the museum where they have got some pictures.” So as a result of this kind of behavior, new type of branches came out of the same tree. The sects were formed, like we have from Catholicism, Protestants and then from Protestants we have all kinds of Seventh Day [Advent is there, Adventist], we have Pentecostals and this and that and God knows, Unity Church and all sorts of things. Also [twice] Twice Born. Even in Catholicism now they have started a new thing called Charismatic, and we had last time in Paris a boy who came from there and he was all possessed and he started shouting, screaming. He fainted and he had epilepsy.

Now one must know that if it is God’s work or if it’s [the/a] God’s blessings you get, how can you get sick? It is just a mental projection, that to say that God worked for seven days and He rested on Saturday. What difference does it make whether we rest on Sunday or Saturday? And they say when the Pentecost, when the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost came in, the disciples started using their hands in such a manner that people thought they were mad. Because if you are living in a mad world everybody thinks you are mad. They started talking the language of the hands and strange language of the chakras, of the centers. It was not the language like a French speaking English and English speaking French. Mohamed Sahib has said it clearly that at the time of Resurrection your hands will speak. I say Martin Luther was a realized soul, but where he went wrong was to bifurcate this branch of Christianity by saying that there was all wrong with the Pope. But one must understand that this was the very wrong approach because we must always go to the fundamentals of everything.

I think there are three things fundamental of Christ’s life. The first and foremost thing He has said that we are to be born again. That doesn’t mean any crazy priest puts his hand on your head and says, “You are born again,” or you take a self certificate, “born again”, move about. That means it has to be some living process worked in you, something evolutionary, by which you become something great. As Mohamed Sahib has said, you become a “walli”. As Krishna has said that you become stitha pragya.

Translator: You become what?

Shri Mataji: Stitha pragya. Is the one who is completely balanced in life. And pragya means the one whose awareness is enlightened with collective consciousness. But we carried on with all these mythical things, thinking that we were doing the right thing. The second fundamental of Christianity is that Christ died for our sins, that He suffered for us. We do not have to suffer for religion; we do not have to suffer for our ascent. Only we are to be realized souls so that we become one with the Divine; the yoga takes place. So firstly He said to Nicodemus that, “You are to be born again,” and when Nicodemus said, “Is it I [have to] enter into the womb of my mother?” He says, “No, whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh. You are to be born out of the Holy Ghost.”

And the third thing which is the most important thing that He said was that, “I will send you a Redeemer. I’ll send you a Counselor.” What about that prediction that He made about the three qualities of the Holy Ghost who will save you? The Counselor, the Redeemer and the Comforter. Instead of forming these branches of religion – same in Islam, same in Hinduism – we have the same problem that you use your mental projections to solve the spiritual problems. You cannot solve through your petty mind which is such a limited thing. Something living has to happen within us to make us that which is promised. It cannot be an experience of jumping, or changing your dresses, or leaving your dresses. All these we can do ourselves. What is there to talk of Spirit. then?

As late as hundred years back William Blake has clearly said that men of God will be born on this earth and they will have the blessings of the Holy Ghost. They will become the prophets and they will have power to make others prophets. Even Jung who really opposed Freud, because Freud, you know what he has given us, is AIDS. There’s another disease now coming from the same great man whom we followed more than Christ. It makes a person insane before he is forty years of age. So that is how we have gone wrong in our choices. The greatest mistake in the Bible was that we introduced Paul there. What was Paul? He never saw Christ. He was a man suffering from epilepsy. He[’s] talked nothing about Christ. How can he understand Christ? Now there is a very big group of people in England who think themselves to be great intellectuals and theologians, are saying that Christ was not divine. By studying theology you can’t understand Christ. It is said that Atma [Hindi], “By through your Spirit only you will know Him.” Where is your Spirit? I don’t know French, but in English Spirit means all kinds of things. It can mean “alcohol”, it can mean “a dead body” and it can mean your Atma.

So now under these confused conditions one has to talk about something that is very deep. This is the knowledge of the roots. This we knew in India thousands of years back. Fourteen thousands years back, Markandeya wrote about it, and many people after that elaborately explained it. But in the last hundred years the same great country has created such frauds that you cannot imagine how far one can go with fraudulent statements. So what you call the baptism is a living process within us of the Kundalini awakening, and you have to feel the cool breeze out of fontanel bone, yourself. In the Bible it is said, “I will appear before you as tongues of flames.” What are these tongues of flames, are nothing but the centers. There is falsehood quite a lot, but there has to be the truth as well. So you should not despair. Everybody can get their Self-realization, absolutely, effortlessly, spontaneously, because it is a living process.

All this mechanism that is shown here can be related to the medical terminology of sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. Now the awakening of the Kundalini is a spontaneous happening. As a seed, when you plant it in the Mother Earth, the Mother Earth itself sprouts the seed spontaneously. In the same way, the Kundalini rises and gives you that power by which you become collectively conscious. You can know about yourself and you can know about others. First of all, your health improves; your diseases disappear. Sahaja Yoga had cured one person suffering from AIDS, and he was quite all right for a year or so, but again he went back to his bad habits and did not take to Sahaja Yoga and again he is sick. After all, the Creator has created us with such care and love. And there must be some purpose behind it. He doesn’t want us to just end up as sex points or some sensational nonsense. So He, we should say that the Divine Itself, is anxious that you all should get your realization because you have been seekers of ages.

The Kundalini awakening takes place, and you can feel the cool breeze on top of your head and first time you start feeling the All-pervading Power of God’s Love as cool breeze. Shankaracharya has described as salilam salim, means cool and cool and cool. Buddha also has talked of only Self-realization. He did not want to talk of God because when you start talking of God everybody thinks they have become God themselves. So to be practical, he and Mahavira, both of them, said that, “First have your realization. Then we’ll talk.” So we have to have our Self-realization first. You may say that, “We would like to know all the intricacies and all the mechanism, how it works out.” You will know it, but as if you have to put the light in this hall you have to just switch on. One switch can work the whole thing. It’s all built-in. Why not have the light first and then we’ll talk about it? There’s lot of time. I think that’s what it is, what we have to achieve.

Today it has been an introduction to Sahaja Yoga, but tomorrow I’ll elaborately tell you – day after tomorrow isn’t it? I’ll elaborately tell you about what works it out, what is Kundalini, every details that we can touch in that short lecture. Thank you very much. But if you have any questions I would like to answer. And then we’ll have the session of realization also. [To the translator: What are doing, you are telling Me in French or what?]

Translator: We’ve actually answered his questions.

Shri Mataji: And what’s that?

Translator: Well, he was saying how about practice, how do we get to the practical aspect, and we just said after that we’ll have the session of realization.

Shri Mataji: That’s it. That’s what we are going to have: first of all the realization, and then we have a center here. We have some people who have been doing Sahaja Yoga for quite some time. You have to join them. They will tell you one by one how you master yourself fully. First, of course, is the realization. But how to keep it up, how to use it, how to work it out, how to be the master, that you have to pay little time. They, I am told the first time that the French are charging little money for the book-keeping and the paper and the tapes; little bit, not much. Of course, I don’t take any money, and you cannot purchase Me. It cannot be purchased. So I, it’s a very little money – that’s what they said – that they have to charge, because all the pressure of everything was on them. So it’s all right. I mean, they will show you all the accounts, where they send, [spend it].

There is one more point I want to make it, that Freud has said that we should not be conditioned by anything. So our egos have developed too much. And we say, “What’s wrong?” in everything we do. Like in England some people came to Me with painted hair and funny dresses and I asked them, “Why do you do it?” They said, “What’s wrong?” I said, “It’s wrong because your eyesight will become weak.” But if we do not understand the practical way of life which is balanced, we really become very one-sided. So now we have to understand that it is not a mental projection. And when the triggering of the Kundalini takes place, actually it presses on both the sides, or sucks in on both the sides the ego and the superego, as you see there, the conditionings as well as your ego. And this portion of the head which is the fontanel bone area becomes softer. Actually it happens. Then you do not get conditioned nor into ego, but you become the Spirit, the free Spirit, the Spirit of wisdom. You start feeling the vibrations of cool breeze on your hands, fingertips, and you start, and you can find out fundamental answers to any questions, as if you become a complete computer. First time the absolute starts asserting itself, manifesting itself on the central nervous system.

So whatever you feel on your central nervous system is the evolutionary gain. That is a real ascent, not just a mental projection nor a [serve, some] sort of a subservient attitude towards someone or accepting somebody because he appeals to your mind, but you become the absolute discriminating element that [missing part]. Element, element, you become the element of that. So we have to understand that we have such a potential within us. Like a television: if you see, it looks like a box, but if put to the mains you know what it is. In the same way, this human being that looks very ordinary [it’s/is] tremendous. It is fantastic. Only it is to be put to the mains and the connections have to be fixed properly. It can be sometimes loose. Only that alertness is needed. Sahaja also means easy. Whatever is spontaneous is the easiest. Whatever is vital has to be easiest. Say, for our breathing if we have to get to a guru, what will happen to us? That’s what it is. Any other question? Yes. No, here, the lady. What is he [saying/telling]?

Translator: He, he wants to know where, where to go to get his realization.

Shri Mataji: Here, only just now, just now. Nowhere to go. Here. All right. What else did you say, sir?

New person: Once you have this realization can it fall back [to sleep/asleep] again?

Shri Mataji: Can you?

New person: Fall back [to sleep/asleep], fall asleep again.

Shri Mataji: No, you shouldn’t. Why do you sleep? You have to be alert. You have to work for God. You have to give realizations to others. You are now enlightened. As Christ has said, the light is not put under the table. Why should you sleep? We have to work very hard. We have to save thousands and thousands. The epidemic is coming of satanic forces like drugs, this, that. Who is going to work it out? But doing all this you are relaxed. You do it as a drama, as a play, leela. What else did you ask? Some question there, gentleman there.

Translator: The lady was asking a question. The lady was asking a question.

Shri Mataji: Yes, madam. You tell Me. Make it short, madam. What is it? What’s she saying?

Translator: She’s asking, “Don’t You know such other gurus of people seeking and working in directions of the same as You?”

Shri Mataji: There are, very few. They are hiding in the Himalayas. They don’t want to face. I sent one gentleman to America. He ran away from there in three days. [They’re all mad?] But I’m not a guru. I’m a Mother. And you have to become the guru. You have to become your own guru. You don’t need any other guru but yourself. Good. All right? Now, yes.

Another new person: Is it necessary to become vegetarian?

Shri Mataji: What did he say?

New person: Because in [natural] and I think the yogi way, the Indian way is the vegetarian way, the pure way. Do you think it’s necessary for all these people to become vegetarians?

Shri Mataji: Not at all, not at all. Who told you that? No, no, no, no. All that is all [false/facts]. You see, [we/one] should eat whatever is suitable to us. For example, I would say those who eat too much of cheese should not eat. That’s French.

New person: [unclear] who say as long as there are slaughter houses there will be slaughtered [people/beings]?

Shri Mataji: Slaughter what?

Translator: Slaughter houses where they kill animals.

Shri Mataji: Ha, so what is he worried about?

Translator: For there as long as we kill animals, then we’ll be killing also human beings.

Shri Mataji: Now, just say what I would suggest now. For people who are right-sided, they should not eat too much meat. But those who are left-sided should eat. Otherwise, they’ll be even worse. Left-sided people must eat meat but, now just a minute, just a minute, just a minute. Now by saving the chickens what are we going to achieve? Chickens, am I going to give them realization? Can I give it to the pigs? Can I? Save the human beings first. Please pay attention to the most important thing. They are human beings. There are people who need proteins. They have to have proteins. Like in India, I would say, many people should have proteins. If they can afford, they should have. But they are very weak. Mentally they are all right but muscular. You may not agree, but that’s what it is, because if by becoming vegetarian if you get to God and by starving and fasting, we are already doing it in India. If you want to have fasting you’ll have fasting all your lives. That’s what it is. When the Jews did not believe in Christ they said, “We must have suffering.” They had it. And now you ask for fasting, you’ll have it, lives together. Better starve; that’s what you want. Do you want your Spirit or you want all these things? By these things you are not going to reach to God. On the contrary, you must have a good health. If you don’t have a good health you cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi.

New person: But other yogis are vegetarians. They will never have any [meat] I know.

Shri Mataji: Who is the? You tell Me one name. You just tell Me one who is a “other yogi”, according to you. What good they have done? Have they given realization? You are not realized yourself. If you have met them, why didn’t you get your realization?

New person: Why are you getting angry?

Shri Mataji: No, I am not getting angry. I am just asking you. You, I am not getting angry. Why? What makes you think I am getting angry? I am on the loudspeaker. You are not; that’s all. All right? This is not the way. You see, we must understand what have we been doing so far. What did we achieve out of it? Be sensible. You have to be sensible. And the sense is that if you go on paying attention to things which are not concerning the Spirit, it won’t work out. Like Krishna killed many people. He had to. The Goddess had to kill so many rakshasas and devils. She had to. She had to even drink the blood of this Raktabija. If you have read the books you will know what they had to do. After all, you see, whatever has to be done has to be done. That’s how; it’s all right. All right let’s have... You see, you must have more care for the human beings, not for all these things. You see, there is a community in India called Jains. They even try to save the bugs and the mosquitoes. Are we going to give realization to mosquitoes?

New person: That means they try it. But didn’t Buddha say the same about?

Shri Mataji: He never said it. Now about Buddha, don’t tell me because Buddha died by eating the pig. Now He could not have been said that. It’s not true. All right? That settles it. Buddha, don’t try to manipulate Him. He has been very much manipulated. When I went to China – luckily, because of My husband I travel a lot – I was surprised the lama, the Dalai Lama, his things were kept there written in Pali, because I wrote, I read Pali, and all the things that he had were made of solid gold. His beer cup, his another jug, this that. He’s a vegetarian for every purpose, but all the money, all the money that he got it from these poor Tibetans. And even today if you go and see him, he is the one who is introducing drugs.

Sahaja Yogi: He’s understanding, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogi: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: All right, all right. He understands; he understands, yes. And this is a very good example of showing how a person who is kind to the animals like Dalai Lama and to the poor Tibetans, he actually sucked their blood, because I don’t know how he made so much gold that he had plates of gold and everything. And even if you go and see him now in Dharamsala he [has/had] a complete, big Buddha made out of real gold and he takes food in nothing but gold. Even his bathtub, like what we call a gangali in Indian language – that’s not a tub but a kind of big bucket sort of a thing – was of real gold. I mean, imagine the compassion of this man. The Tibetans, poor things, suffering without any warm clothes – [it’s a] very cold country – and this gentleman making all the gold for himself. What is the compassion? And we have many communities in India like that who are absolute vegetarians and extremely cruel.

New person: All the Tibetans are not vegetarians. There’s only the Dalai Lama who is. Because all the Tibetans, they eat lots of meat.

Shri Mataji: But he, I’m talking about Dalai Lama and his personal life.

Sahaja Yogi: But he’s the one who’s get gold.

New person: But I think there’s one thing about Dalai Lama. I was in journey when he gave a speech. [In just/And in this] half an hour he was talking about twenty times one word. [And] you know what it was? It was [warm-hearted].

Shri Mataji: But he talks/To talk. Talking is different. Doing is different.

New person: What is, what is it [unclear]?

Shri Mataji: Now you go to him, that’s the [missing part]. All right, now the thing is, main thing one must understand, that compassion doesn’t talk. You don’t have to talk; it acts. It works. It doesn’t talk. It’s silent. To see the compassion of a person, you should see Christ. Somebody touched the cloth of Christ and that was cured. And you must know Sahaja Yoga has cured many people, just like that. People have given up their drugs, just like that. The power of compassion is the power of God, which is the All-pervading Power, which acts, which thinks, which understands, which connects, which redeems, which completely transforms you. That is what is compassion is. You don’t have to talk about it. You have to feel it. It is all-pervading. Yes.

New person: In fact, I have several questions but I’m thinking [of] making them short.

Shri Mataji: All right.

New person: First, now since I followed Your teaching very well [and/that] if enlightened person [the way it is] and then [unclear] [like/I understand] that. But unfortunately, there are many people who are not enlightened. And then the questions I want to ask are the following ones. First You said, when you are enlightened you do not have diseases.

Shri Mataji: No.

New person: But [then] I have many examples of, Ramana Maharishi who died of cancer is an example.

Shri Mataji: Who, who died of cancer?

Translator: Ramana Maharishi.

Shri Mataji: Ha, that was, that was one mishap. I tell you why, because even if some are realized souls. I must say, Ramana Maharishi was a great personality, no doubt. But the thing is, you see, some people died of cancer because they had no one to tell them how to get cured. I’m here to tell you. I know how to do it. I know this trick, [for them] this is the [need]. I know he died. I’m very sorry because he was a realized soul, no doubt. He was a great person, but I was not there at that time. I can tell you how to cure cancer. I have cured the cancer of our ex-president, who was Mr. Sanjiva Reddy. You may write to him and find it. In ten minutes.

New person: [There was another one in Bombay]. [unclear]

Shri Mataji: No, no, please stand up and say. We can’t hear you. Just... All right. No, no, you see, hello, see now. I, I will say in short one thing. Let us see. Whatever I have said it, see, see, hello, I’ll just tell him. He understands English. I’ll just tell him. Whatever I am saying, hello, just a minute, just a minute. Listen to Me, one minute. No, no let Me tell him. Just don’t confuse everyone. Whatever I am saying it is to be first of all seen, if it works or not. Supposing it is My hypothesis, as a scientist you must have patience, see for yourself, it works or not. If it does not work, then you can say, but just now you have patience. You cannot just now, by argument how will I prove it? All right, sit down, then. So better take the medicine and see. Now they want to have it. All right, you do one thing, you write it down your question. I’ll answer tomorrow. They are very anxious to have realization. [To translator: Answer.] They are impatient. I think you should write down all your questions, give it to Me tomorrow and I’ll try to answer, because it’s not difficult to answer these questions, but can you wait? Why not have realization? Just have realization then. All right? Ha, have patience. Let us have water, please.

It’s good that you can ask Me questions. But I like it that you can ask Me questions. I like it very much, for one reason: that you are free; it shows you are free. You are not under any spell. It’s a very good sign, that you can ask Me questions. But those who have been to gurus, they never ask questions. They just go on paying money. So let us first get realization because the knowledge is very, very great. I must have given at least three thousand lectures in English language, at least. Now, it’s not, cannot be discussed in one lecture. Now, there are, majority of the people want realization. So let us [yield/lead] to the majority, all right? [Hindi].

Translator: Mother.

Shri Mataji: Let’s have it now. Anybody, I think this lady sitting next to you [it] finds it difficult. Let her come in front, next to you. She could come. The lady next to you, this lady, there. Let us have. [One of/Now] the first thing is you have to be comfortable because your attention should not be diverted. You have come for the first time and attention can be diverted very easily. Because the attention is like, say it is like My sari, you can say that, spread out and the Kundalini pushes it in. So if it is tied outside it’s rather difficult. So the attention has to be kept free.

Secondly, if you think anything is tied on your neck or on your waist, anywhere tied just little bit, reduce the pressures. Thirdly, you have to keep your eyes shut. You don’t need, need not wear your spectacles. It has a better effect on your eyesight also. You don’t have to open your eyes throughout. Fourthly, those who do not want to do should go away to be civil, to be kind to others, because negative people disturb the happening, and the neighbors suffer from such people. It’s a very sensitive and delicate happening. And it has to work out. The desire should be that it should work out. I cannot guarantee that hundred per cent people will get it today. I cannot guarantee. But most of you should, because you are quite complicated.

So simple things are to be done. First of all we have to touch the Mother Earth. If you can take out your shoes I’ll be thankful. [Apart: Little less to be, this to be little less would be better. It’s all right, it doesn’t matter for Me, I’m quite used to them now.] If you don’t need them better to put them off really. It’s too much sometimes, all the time [lights]. But the back ones are quite a lot also there. It’s all right.

Now tomorrow I’ll tell you that the left side in us is our emotional side, is the side of the power of desire within us. And the Kundalini is the pure desire. And the right side is the power of action. Now, just to tell you I am telling you, but later on you will understand it fully what it is. It is not just like talking about something big. It’s just you will know everything. Now, you have to put your left hand on your lap very comfortably, very comfortably, on your lap. Loudly, loudly, they can’t hear [something/some]. And the posture should be straight, need not bend, need not bend back but straight in a normal way. It’s all right; this is better. Now left hand towards Me, and right hand first I’ll tell you to put it on your heart because here resides the Spirit. Then the center that is on the left-hand side of our stomach. The whole work we have to do on the left-hand side. Now the left hand is always kept towards Me like this. That is the desire that you want to get your realization. Then the second center you have to touch with your right hand is on the left-hand side of your stomach in the lower part of your abdomen. Now again you have to raise them from there to the upper part of the stomach on the left-hand side. Little loudly. And then again on your heart. You need not close your eyes. First you can see; then I’ll tell you what to say. Then this right hand on this center here on the left-hand side, holding it tight. This is catching the worst among all of you. This center catches when we feel guilty. You should not feel guilty at all. As it is, you are the temple of God. There is no need to feel guilty at all. At the very outset I would request you not to feel guilty.

Now the right hand is taken on the forehead here. Now at the back. Then you have to stretch your hand and put this on the fontanel bone area here where it was a soft bone. Loudly. And press it hard. Seven times you have to move it. That’s all. Now, we’ll do it after closing our eyes. Only thing remember don’t put your hand from this side but when you come to this center you have to put it this way. All right. It’s a very simple thing. Anybody can do it, and you will be surprised that already so many of you have no thoughts in the mind. It’s already crossed the Agnya, this portion, the center of Christ, it [is/has] crossed. You can see.

Now, please put your left hand all the time towards Me and repeat in your heart what I say. First of all, first of all, tell yourself that you are not guilty. “I am not guilty.” Say that in your heart. All right. Now close your eyes. Now put your right hand on your heart. Now you have to ask Me a question. You may call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother” or whichever way you like. You please ask Me a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Close the eyes. Close the eyes. Don’t keep them open. Just close them, because closing the eyes, the attention is taken inside. “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Three times.

Now this question follows another question, that if you are the Spirit you are your own guide, you are own guru; you are your own master. So now you put your right hand on the upper part of your stomach, on the left-hand side which is the center of mastery. This is the center which is created by the masters, the great masters, who are satgurus, who are real masters, like Abraham, Moses, Janaka, Nanak, Lao Tze, Mohamed Sahib. Now you take this hand little deep, [press it], push it little deep into that area in the upper part of the abdomen, and ask a question three times, “Mother, am I my own guide? Am I my own master? Am I my own guru?” Ask in your heart, in your heart. This will neutralize if you have been to some wrong master. Please be seated, sir. Must be feeling hot. [There’s one of the] Rajnesh’s na?

Translator: Perhaps.

Shri Mataji: Please go [for it]. Now, don’t pay attention to others. [This is the/It’s a] time for you to pay attention to yourself. When are you going to pay attention to yourself? Loudly, Marie, you go down. Now, now this hand is to be taken down below on the lower part of the abdomen, on the left-hand side, please, lower part. Loudly just say. Press it hard. This is the center which gives you the true knowledge or works out the technique of true knowledge, called as shuddha vidya. That’s the technique of working out God’s laws. So to awaken this I have to ask you, that I cannot cross your freedom. You have to ask, “Mother, please give me true knowledge.” Please ask six times because this center has got six petals. Right, right Agnya is too much. Please ask six times. Right Agnya is too much. Now better, better. Now, now by asking this, the Kundalini starts moving. Raise your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side and again push it with your fingers. Right hand, in the upper part of the abdomen. Now as the Kundalini is awakening, you have to give a seat to the Kundalini or the assurance to the Kundalini. Without feeling guilty, with full confidence in yourself, you assert by saying, “Mother, I am my own guru. I am my own master. I am my own guide.” Ten times, because there are ten gurus. Ten times, with full confidence in you. Now, ten times it is to be said with full confidence. It’s better. Now, raise this right hand again onto the heart where resides your Spirit. This center has got twelve petals. So please say twelve times, full assertion, full confidence in yourself [Missing part].
