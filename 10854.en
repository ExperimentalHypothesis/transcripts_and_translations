Sahaja yogi: So this is by Geetanjali from Rabindra Nath Tagore ...
On the shores of Barat When the man of all races has come together awakened my mind standing here ......

Shri Mataji: This is the thing of [unclear] with the description...That's the one ...

He is the English man about 50-60 years back ...he wrote ...
All the poets have written about Sahaja yoga, western poets, there...Have you got it? What is it? what 's the beginning?
Sahaja Yogi: It is clear!
Shri Mataji: Clear cut! Its clearly written
Sahaja Yogi: He must be having in mind Ganpati pule ...
Shri Mataji: Yes, absolutely!
Sahaja yogi: On the shores...
Shri Mataji: Mother is awakened ...
Exact! They were seers, you see...They could see it ...They were seers ...No

Shri Mataji: This is the description of the procession that we have ...See
How the seers have seen through ...
Sahaja yogi: The reason why I asked that there was another river was this :
[Unclear ]
A few minutes later I realised my mistake some kind of procession was approaching us and the light came from the persons who composed it ...First came the bright spirit It asked and [unclear] ......
Then on the left and right ...at each side of the forest [unclear]....came useful shapes ..Boys on one hand and girls upon the other If I could remember that singings and write down the notes No man Whatever sick or old ...Between them went musicians and after this a lady in whose honour this was being done ...
But I have forgotten an..................[unclear]

Shri Mataji : (In Marathi )

Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji Its a pity that we have not realised that what you are And human beings as we are Who still doubt sometimes because your form is so distinctive your Maya that we really don't know what you are ...

[Then In Marathi the Sahaja yogi is giving the speech ]

It’s for a short time and he is saying again he would be playing ...

I don’t know how to thank him and also Abhijit for giving a beautiful rendering and in 2 sittings ...It is all the grace and the beauty of the divinity that has worked out so well that they came to give you this beautiful recital ...Give them a hand.

You would like to have dinner Or have the Music finished and then go for dinner...

Sahaja yogis: Music!

Shri Mataji: You don't want dinner

Sahaja yogi to Sahaja Yogi: You are in a hopeless minority... :)

Shri Mataji: (In Hindi )

Sahaja yogi[?]to all Sahaja yogi:

He compromises that we will get up at 1:00 o'clock...

That is my work, not your work...You have every right on it ...

He has to be in Delhi ...For recording

He is recording for the National Program...

Well, he has agreed to stay back and attend weddings and shall go on the 5th...

To me, Budhaditya Ji is not only like a younger brother but he is also like a son in law because he is married, one of the girls of my colony in Nagpur  So I have a double right on it If he doesn't behave then I will report to his wife. ( Residing in Ajanta Colony, Where I stay  )

Shri Mataji: Now we will be playing the last raga of Bhairavi and he has promised to play tomorrow the special one called tappa.Alright?

[After Performance]

Words fail to thank such a celestial artist. We all are so much enjoying the music, the silence and the beauty as if this sitar was speaking And there are many great poets born in this Malegaon place called Keshav Sood and he has written a poem on the Sitar that speaks ...Can you imagine? What a coincidence it is? That here the Sitar has started speaking as Keshav Sooda has said a long time back ...

These are not coincidences these are all the parts of the play of the divine which is so great ...Which has no time and that's why you have lost, you have forgotten what's the timeline...

So I, Thank you very much Mr Budhaditya and also Abhijeet both of them for giving us such a beautiful time ...Thank you very much!

Thank you!

Now tomorrow morning, We are going to have ...This auspicious time starting about weddings ...Now as I have to announce about that I would say that tomorrow at 11 O'Clock  We will go to the western camp where we will have the Haldi because you have the provision for washing and all that and those who want to have the [unclear /cloth ] should have it beforehand and that at that time all those ornaments and everything that you have ordered for will be provided. So that for the evening you could be made ready and then we will take you further announcement as to how we are going to have weddings ...It's a very large number... for the first time, we have got the 70...So you can imagine the 70 is complete.

Mr Sarraf has made the arrangement for the hair cut ...He is an architect I don't know how he has managed this part ...In Sahaja Yoga, anyone can do anything ...Alright ! and after that is the Haldi for that you should wear very ordinary clothes and must keep one change for yourself handy or hanging So that after haldi you could use it... So at 11 O'clock, that's what I think is the best time I will arrive there and all the rest of the boys and the girls should be there separated ...I hope this will be all arranged by Mr Sarraf and other parties who will be there...So just have these 2 parties tomorrow ready for the Haldi and after that, you will have your bath, take your rest in the day time and evening time we might start the wedding at about 6 O'clock or so but I will have to see how the arrangements are and then we will give you the full details ...So we again thank you very much for giving us such a beautiful time and We have to thank Baba...Also, I can call him  Mama ... :)for organising the whole of this concept of a concert which I least expected and it has worked out so well, so beautifully. It's all my luck to have such brothers who can help me ...

Moreover, they care so much for the artist and respect them the way I want ...All the artist must be respected. Because they are so respectable and I hope a day will come when we will be inviting all this Nagpur troop abroad in our centres and give the pleasure of this beautiful concert to all other Sahaja yogis all over the world and to all your people of your own country ...May God bless you!
