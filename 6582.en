Shri Ganesha and Christmas Puja. Ganapatipule (India), 24 December 1991.

[Talk in Hindi]

In short, I told them what is so special about today, tonight, is the time when, this is Tuesday, on Tuesday Shri Ganesha was born. So they celebrate every fourth day of the moon as the Shri Ganesha's birth date because He was born on the fourth. But when this fourth falls on a Tuesday then they think it's a tremendous yoga, because on Tuesday He was born. On Tuesday, this fourth of the month has come, so they just try to worship it as a something special day.

Now I also told them what is the quality of Shri Ganesha, which we see in Christ and, as Christ is the Incarnation of Shri Ganesha, today remarkable thing is that the third yoga is that today is the birthday of Christ. And the fourth thing, which is very important, is that you all should be here on such-and-such day on Ganapatipule.

So it's very important day and that's how we have to learn that if you worship Ganapati or if you worship Christ, we should try to think what qualities we have got within ourselves.

Now regarding Jesus Christ - you know Him very well - that He always talked of morality, always talked of holiness, of auspiciousness. And all these things, you see, the holiness and the complete cleanliness within your being is to such an extent that, I said, He said that, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes." So Shri Ganesha also was against the adultery. Any kind of adultery He was against and that's why those people who indulge into adulterous life suffer, suffer very badly. It's rather difficult to cure them. All these diseases which are incurable of Ganesha's problems are really difficult, because here you have insulted Shri Ganesha and that's why He gets angry with you.

Now, His style is of two type(s). One is by which He soothes you down, He soothes your Kundalini and the second one is where He really gets angry with you and tries to punish you. These two qualities here, so one has to be very careful when you are dealing with your morality. The morality should be a part and parcel of your being. That you should be proud that you are moral and that you should try to lead a very moral life without torturing anybody, without troubling anybody. In Sahaja Yoga, I hope it is all very clear cut that we have to lead a very, very moral life.

Of course, all My lecture can be translated later and I hope you'll be able to enjoy it. But this is the best part of it, that today we have the birthday of Christ, the birthday of Shri Ganesha and also on such a date which is so well-worshipped and regarded as something important in India.

May God bless you all!
