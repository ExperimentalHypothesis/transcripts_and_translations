My dearest Children,

Thank you very much for the beautiful flowers you sent me. They remind me of you all. I missed you very much all those days of separation.

I hope you get my tapes from Australia, I have said lots of new wonderful things.

I am coming back very soon to enjoy your joyful and sweet company.

Yours as ever,
Your loving mother Nirmala
