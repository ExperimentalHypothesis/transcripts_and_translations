 (England)
I got my realisation in Australia, but I very soon came to England. About four or five months after I got my realisation, I ended up in England. I never thought of myself as a seeker. Somebody told me afterwards, "Oh, I always picked you as a seeker." I thought, what's a seeker? I didn't even know the word guru.

At that stage, my lifestyle was one where you'd have everything you think you'd want: a nice flat overlooking the harbour in Sydney, a fast car, and a job where you're travelling around the world. But there was a big hole in my life, and it reached that sort of emotional state where everything was starting to fall apart and go wrong.

I had come back from a long-haul trip, and I was tired. I was just going into the supermarket to get some milk and stock up when this girl who lived quite near my flat, who I knew very vaguely, saw me. She was often asking me to parties and things, and I thought she was crazy; I was never going to her parties. She said, "Oh, okay, how are you going?" And I've gone, "Oh, God, my life is like this..." So I'm having this great whinge to her, and she's banging me on my left shoulder the whole time. I thought, why is she hitting me on the left shoulder? I was feeling so tired, just having a nice whinge.

And she said, "Oh, what you need is this lady." She pulled her pendant up, and I've gone, "Oh, okay then." I thought, what do you say? I thought it was nice. She said, "You come to my house on Sunday night." This was a Friday. It was the 1st of August, 1980, I remember. And I said, "Okay." So having turned down parties and things she'd invited me to before, suddenly, out of spontaneity, I said, "Yes, I'll come."

I remember walking to the dairy department to get my milk and standing there thinking, I don't feel tired anymore. I had this rush of energy. I felt fantastic. It was amazing. I never had another cigarette—I was wanting to give up cigarettes—and never had another one. I went home and wrote these Dear John letters and sorted out my love life and stuff. I had no idea what was happening. I was just suddenly... everything was falling into place. And all I had seen was Mother's picture on the pendant.

Then I went to her place on Sunday, and they sat me down in the kitchen, put Mother's picture there, and said, "Put your hands out." And I thought, what? I thought, I knew I shouldn't have come to this crazy woman's house. They were knitting away and saying, "Oh, she's got it." I'm thinking, well... They said, "Look at her eyes. Look at this. Can you feel it?" I thought, no, I can't feel anything. I thought, oh dear. Anyhow, they gave me this picture and sent me home, and she said, "By the way, she's God." And I've gone, "Okay."

I do remember putting the black and white, official photograph of Shri Mataji down by the gear stick of my car and driving home, thinking, "Well, who am I to say she's not?" So I give myself credit for having an open mind. Because she told me that straight off, I thought, it's between her and I, and we have to work this out. I think if I'd come to a public program, listened to a lecture, or looked at the Sahaja Yogis around me, I would have gone, "No, no, no, they're all crazy."

To me, the seeking wasn't something I could name; I didn't even know the word guru. It was more that I had to have the answer this lifetime. That's all I knew. I didn't want to sit and be 80 years old with that blank look on my face, thinking, it's all over and I still don't know the answer. I thought, I'm not dying till I get the answer.

And of course, that's it. I always knew that something special was going to happen to me when I was 35 because I was always going on about turning 35. People would say, "What's so special about that?" and I've gone, "I don't know. It's just that that's when I'm going to be complete. I'll be complete at 35." They said, "What do you mean?" I thought, I don't know what I mean, but it's going to be complete. And of course, it was my 35th year that I got my realization.

But I had made such a fuss about turning 35 that my sister had given me a surprise birthday party, which was the most disastrous night of my life. She'd just gone through my address book and invited everybody. I said, "Why did you do this? It was horrible. You had the plumber there! People I never wanted to meet." It was just such a dreadful night. And she said, "Well, you've made such a fuss about turning 35 all your life, I thought we'd better do something special for you." But it was some months later that I actually got my real birthday present, on the 1st of August, 1980.

I was transferred in my job to London, which was a miracle. It was all just orchestrated by Shri Mataji from beginning to end. So I guess I was spreading the seeds on planes. I always thought I'd find it somewhere in the next port.
