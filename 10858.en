I am very happy that you all have decided, can you hear me?

To get married in Sahaja Yoga, it looks very simple, to decide like that, but you must know it's a very big responsibility because ours is a global movement and the girls who are married are from different cultures. They come from different cultures, with different education, with different backgrounds and you are also from different countries and different backgrounds. Now the understanding should be that now you all have become global and you follow one religion that is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma and you have no other problems as they have in other religions, marrying inter-religion, inter-national. We have no problems, so we must take our marriages very much gladly and should try to make it a great success. It's very easy to find faults with others and go on fighting and do all kinds of things, but it's even easier to love, to love someone, enjoy someone and be in the company of someone. That's much easier and that's what you can do in Sahaja Yoga. In Sahaja Yoga you'll have no problems in adjusting because you'll find there are many other couples who are already married and have achieved great success. That's how our Sahaja Yoga is spread all over. We don't believe in all the artificial restrictions. We are absolutely open, free and we should love each other, understand each other, show your love to each other, show your affection in such a manner that another person understands.

I found sometimes that, you see, Indian girls are little shy, they are brought up like that and suddenly if you become extremely lovable, I should say, they get a little frightened. So you must have some balance and understanding because you are all older than your wives. So you have to make it a success. Use your wisdom and love and try to understand your wife. She comes from a different culture. You are from a different culture. If you understand that part, I think things will work out very well. There is nothing important than creating a good family for you, having good children. And we have so many now, you'll be happy to know that there are so many people living abroad, even in India, who are making a very good family, very sweet families. So there is always justice for you for doing this thing, so carefully working it out.

That's the divine justice and that's how you are blessed. I don't know what advice I should give you, but one thing I must say, it's all spontaneous. If you go on thinking, making plans and going round and round, it won't work out. Be spontaneous and let your wife also have that confidence about you, that you are a very much a Sahaja Yogi. So far we have had very, very few divorces because of some certain, certain shocking things happened. But in so many years we have hardly even ten divorces. So sometimes it happens that in a hurry and scurry we have not been able to know everything and it has gone wrong. But compared to thousands, if there are ten divorces, it's alright. And very, very good marriages. It's nice to see them, how they work together, how they love each other, don't find faults with each other and appreciate each other.

Somehow it is due to your realization and your full growth of service. Whatever I may tell you, it is left to you. You are [unclear]. How to work it out, to make a very successful marriage and that gives me the greatest joy. If I see husband-wife fighting, I really feel very upset because you are Sahaja Yogis. You have a mission, you have a global mission and you have to have that special type of married life which I desire for everyone. So you are all intelligent, you understand. I leave it to you to find out the ways and methods of expression of your family life as ideal one.

So may God bless you.
