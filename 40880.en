Evening Dance

Shri Mataji: “Wa wa wa”. “Now. (Hindi) We are all sitting like a family sitting together.
There should be a show there, eh?...
Done very well. They’re from Vienna? ...
A composition which you yourself have made it into dance - ... wa wa. Bring her to Cabella” (Shri Mataji laughs).
Yogi: Yes.
Yogini: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Wa wa wa. Such a dancer, she is a teacher also.
I’ll take your leave, and I’ll try to come to tomorrow’s program also]
