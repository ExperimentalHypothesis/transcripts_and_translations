Its very heartening to see you all here again. I am not going to give a big lecture today. But I must say that I am very, very happy and very joyous that how today's Sahaja Yoga is established in Australia. You are one of the best collectives I have seen and My children so beautifully entered into the kingdom of God. May God bless you all, your families, your centres and also your Sahaja Yoga. May God bless you.
