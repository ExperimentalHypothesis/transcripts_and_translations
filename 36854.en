Public Program

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot describe it, we cannot conceptualise it. Whatever I am going to tell you, you are not to believe me blindfolded but you must keep your mind open like a scientist. And treat my speech as hypothesis and if it is proved then you must accept as honest people. Because it is for your individual benevolence, it is for the benevolence of your city, your country, and the whole world.

The truth is that you are not this body, mind, emotions, intellect, ego and your conditionings. But you are the Spirit, the pure Spirit. The second truth is that there is All-pervading power of divine love which does all living work. We see these beautiful flowers here and we take it for granted, which is a miracle. In the same way, our body is functioning, our heart is running, and we take it for granted. Doctors say it is autonomous nervous system, but who is this auto?

In the evolutionary process, we have reached now the state of human awareness. But human awareness is relative. We try to justify everything through our rationality. Hitler could justify his war through his own limited rationality. But we have to reach the absolute truth. Unless and until we know the absolute there will be always fighting and quarrelling going on.

Now within us is placed, you must have been told, a power, in the triangular bone called as sacrum. That means the Greeks knew that it is a sacred bone. Today the problem is, people do not know the aim of their life, their meaning, why they are living on this earth. Like this instrument, if it is not connected to the mains it has no meaning. So this is the power which connects you to this All-pervading power. The awakening of this power is spontaneous, “sahaj”.

So Sahaja Yoga means “with you”, “saha” is “with” you is born (“ja”) the right to have this union, the yoga. It is your own power that works it out. It is not just a speech or a sermon, or a lecture. But it is the actualisation of the experience which is important. And the becoming is very, very essential. That you do not just become member of this and member of that. It is becoming within yourself.

Once you become the Spirit you start manifesting the beautiful qualities of your Spirit. The Spirit is the source of absolute truth. It is the universal being within you. Once you get this connection you start feeling a cool breeze like vibrations because it’s the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, we can say, is the biblical word. But in Sanskrit, it is called as “Paramchaitanya”. In Koran, it is called as “Ruh”. And Patanjali has called it as “Ritambara Pragnya”. Whatever name one may give, the sensation is of cool breeze from your hands and also out of your fontanel bone area. Once this power of Spirit starts manifesting you become, also, collectively conscious. 

You see there are centres through which this power flows. And these centres are responsible for our physical, emotional, mental being; also for a spiritual being. So most of the problems of this world are coming from human beings. And the problems from human beings come because their centres are in jeopardy. So when this power rises, passes through these centres, it nourishes your centres and integrates them. And ultimately connects you to this power of divine love.

This power thinks, organises. It is like a big computer it works. Thus you become powerful yourself because you can feel this power in your fingertips. You can feel your own centres, what is wrong with you through self-knowledge, and also through collective consciousness you can feel the centres of others. Once you are established in your connection you can know all about it. You can cure yourself and you can cure others. Another power of the Spirit is that your attention becomes enlightened.

We feel that our innocence is lost in the mundane life of modern style. But innocence is never destroyed. It is only covered with some clouds of misbehaviour, we can say. But after you get your Self-knowledge your innocence starts manifesting. So the attention becomes innocent and extremely powerful. You feel your peace within yourself. And the greatest thing that you feel is the joy. Joy is singular, it is not happiness and unhappiness, but is a state in which you see everything as a drama.

One thing is necessary, is to have a pure desire to have your Self-realisation because your freedom is respected. You cannot force Self-realisation on anyone. You cannot pay for it because it is a living process. How much do we pay to Mother Earth for giving us these flowers? She does not understand money or banks, economics. It is love. In the same way it manifests its love and a person becomes extremely compassionate and extremely righteous.

There is no need to tell, “don’t do this”, “don’t do that”; you just do not do it. It is like a snake you are holding in your hand and you are in darkness. And if I say, “It’s a snake in your hand.” you may say through your rationality, “No, it’s a rope.” And if you are obstinate, till the snake bites you, you will go on saying “it’s a rope”. But supposing there is little light then you automatically throw away the snake, I do not have to tell you.

So we have to have this enlightenment. I have to tell you that people have given up drugs, alcoholism overnight after getting Self-realisation. Also, there have been many cases of cures of diseases which are incurable, psychosomatic. All this you do through your own power. You will know all the modus operandi. You will know how to work it out. Within one month you become your own master.

It is all within you. It is too fantastic that is why we do not believe in it. But suppose you take television in a very remote corner of a village somewhere, who have never seen electricity. And you can say, tell them that you can see everything of the whole world through this television. But they will not believe it. They will think it is too fantastic. But when you will put this television to the mains they will discover that it is so.

So by reading about it or by standing on your head, or by suffering and sacrifices you do not get it. Only through pure desire. Because all other desires are not pure. You have one desire today, when it is fulfilled you have another one, goes on. The pure desire, whether you know it or not, is to become one with this All-pervading power of divine love. This knowledge is like an ocean.

In Italy itself I do not know how many lectures I must have given, but as Bologna - it’s one of the last cities I am visiting. And you may go on listening to me but it’s not important. Like in this hall, there are many lights and when you come in you have to just put on one switch. Because it is all built-in. But if I have to tell you about the history and all the way how it has come to your city, then to there, it is all boring. So the best thing is to get the light first and then to know all about it.

So we will have the program just now for about ten - fifteen minutes for getting your Self-realisation. And I am sure you all can get it because you are seekers of truth. It is your right to have it. It will hardly take any time but as I have said, it cannot be forced on you. So those who do not want to have Self-realisation should leave the hall. It would be very kind of them. It hardly takes any time but those who do not want to have it put negative forces.

I also know you have lots of questions. But you can write to them and send it over; we’ll try to answer them. After this program there will be follow-on where you can come and ask questions.

I must say, some of you may get your realisation and you might feel on top of the world because you get into the state of thoughtless awareness, where there are no thoughts to trouble you. If you want to think, you will think, otherwise you won’t think. But one should not get lost because this is a collective happening. If a nail is cut out then it does not grow from the body. So for your Spiritual growth you must come and ask for any knowledge that you want to know, get yourself cured and enjoy the bliss of this divine love.

This is real capitalism and real communism. Because you have all the powers so you become a capitalist. And you are the real communist because you cannot enjoy it without distributing it to everyone. I myself, a seventy-year-old lady who has got a very good husband, a very good family, I’m moving all over the world, giving realisation because I cannot enjoy without that. And I have discovered that it is not how much time you spend your family but how you spend your family is important.

In this lecture, I am sorry I cannot explain to you all the facets of Sahaja Yoga. It is working in fifty-six nations. And you will find your brothers and sisters all over the world. I have seen, we have a seminar in India for a month and these people come from all over the world. I have never seen them quarrelling, fighting, complaining. But even if one person is hurt somewhere, all of them from all the countries just put their attention to it, rush to it, look after it.

Otherwise also, the time has come for all your problems to be solved by divine love. May God bless you all.

I have to make a very humble request that you will have to take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us to suck our problems.

All of you should be seated. It is better that you should be comfortably seated. There are some seats on that side, the backside. It would be better if they come out because I do not see them, in front. It is rather cold I think which is alright. Please come forward all of you, just come out. It is alright. These are all seekers, you can see it.

At the very outset I’ve to tell you there are some conditions. The first condition is that you are not to feel guilty at all. Like, supposing you feel guilty then the centre on the left-hand side goes into trouble and creates a serious condition: you may get spondylitis or you may get a disease like angina; also, you might get very lethargic organs. After all, you are human beings and human beings have to make mistakes. You are not God. So don’t feel guilty at all for anything, forget the past. This is one condition. You have to fulfil it. The second one is that you have to forgive everyone. You don’t have to think about them because it’s a headache. Now logically, if you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. The people who have troubled you are quite happy while you are torturing yourself on their behalf. So be sensible about it and please, please forgive all of them and don’t even think about them because they’re headaches. In a way, forgive yourself and forgive everyone. Also there is another fashion in the West, I find that people want to feel unhappy and tragic. There is no need to feel that way. You are human beings and the epitome of evolution. And all the blessings are waiting for you. You should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself and have respect of yourself because you are human beings. These are the conditions which I request you that please you just fulfil them. Because I do not want this power to stop because you have not fulfilled these simple conditions.

Now, there is a little simple thing which I will show you just now because we have to nourish our centres ourselves. This you have to do only today, tonight with me. You don’t have to remember it at all. So now with a very great respect for yourself and also with a very pleasant feelings towards yourself we start.

Please put your left hand, like this, on your lap wherever you are sitting. And those who are sitting on the chair should put their both the feet separately because there are two powers, left and right. You need not push back yourself too much now just now or you need not also slouch but sit in a comfortable way.

Left side is the power of desire and right side is the power of action. So we use the left side, putting this hand which symbolises that you want to have your Self-realisation. And you use your right hand for nourishing your centres. So he will show you now, that please put your left hand like this and right hand on your heart.

You please do it. Everybody has to do otherwise, you can go out.

.... resides the Spirit. Now, if you are the Spirit you are your own master. So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side because this is the centre of your mastery. Now you take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. This is the centre of pure knowledge which is transformed to your, transferred to your brain. All this you will know later on when you come to the collective. Now please don’t doubt yourself. So then you take your right hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. We are working on the left-hand side. Now please take your right hand on the heart again. Now in the corner of your neck and shoulder where I told you when you feel guilty the centre goes out. Now turn your head to your right.

I think in this congregation many are feeling guilty. Please do not feel guilty.

Now raise your right hand on your forehead across and bend your head as far as possible. This is the centre where you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them. Forgive them in general. Now, please take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. At this centre, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your own satisfaction only, you have to ask forgiveness from this divine power. Now, for your own satisfaction you have to do it. This is now the last centre, where you stretch your hand, palm fully. Now, please put the right hand on top of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now, please put down your head. Pay attention on top of your head. Now, it’s important to push back your fingers so there is sufficient pressure on your fontanel bone area. Now, please move your hand slowly, slowly clockwise pressing the scalp, seven times. Push back your fingers, push back your fingers. Otherwise there is no pressure.

Now, please close your eyes and don’t open them till I tell you. Take down your hands. Now we start. Please put the left hand towards me properly and those who are sitting on the chair, both the feet separately. Better it is to take out your spectacles.

Put the right hand on your heart and please close your eyes. Here you have to say a question which is a very fundamental thing about yourself. You have to ask a question. You can call me “Mother” or “Shri Mataji”, whatever you like. So please ask a question in your heart, not loudly, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask this question three times.

Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your master. So please take your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and ask me another fundamental question three times. Now please ask three times, “Mother, am I my own master?”

I’ve already told you that I cannot force Self-knowledge on you. You have to ask for pure knowledge. Now please put your right hand on the lower portion of the abdomen on the left-hand side. And here you have to ask six times because this centre has got six petals. Please say, “Mother, give me pure knowledge.” six times. As soon as you start asking for pure knowledge this power, which we call kundalini, starts rising. So we have to nourish our upper centres with our self-confidence.

So please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and here you say with full confidence in yourself ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

I’ve already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, this ego, these conditionings or emotions but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand up to your heart and here, again with your self-confidence, you have to say twelve times; here you have to say twelve times with full confidence, “Mother, I am the pure Spirit.”

This All-pervading power of divine love is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of knowledge. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you have committed get easily dissolved in this ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head towards your right. Here you have to say sixteen times, “Mother, I am not guilty at all.” Say this with full confidence.

Now, I‘ve already told you that logically whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. You torture yourselves on their behalf. So now you have to forgive all of them without thinking individually about them.

So now please raise your right hand on your forehead across and bend your head. Now here you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.” in general. Not how many times, but from your heart you have to say it, it is very important.

Now, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-pervading divine power. Now please take your right hand to the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, please say from your heart, not how many times, “Mother”, or you can say, “Oh, Divine power, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes.” Say it from your heart, not how many times.

Now the last centre is very important. So now you stretch your palms fully and put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area. Please do not hold your head but push back your fingers. And now please bend your head as far as possible. And now move your scalp seven times. But I cannot force Self-realisation on you so you have to ask seven times for your Self-realisation by saying, “Mother, please give me my Self-realisation.” So seven times, while moving your scalp seven times clockwise, please say that, “Mother, please give me Self-realisation.”

Now please take down your hands and open your eyes. Please put both your hands towards me like this and watch me without thinking.

Now, please put your right hand towards me and your head down and see with your left hand, away from the head, if there is a cool or hot breeze coming in, through your fontanel bone area. Some people get it hot, or cold, does not matter.

Now, please put the left hand and bend your head. And see with the right hand now, bending your head if there is a cool or hot breeze coming out of your head.

Once more you have to do it with your right hand, put down your head and see with the left hand if there is a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area or a hot breeze. Some people get it little far away, some closer, but don’t put your hand on your head.

Now please put both the hands like this. And now raise both the hands like this and push back your head and ask a question, one of these three questions, anyone. “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the divine love?” or “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”, or “Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya?” Ask any one of these questions thrice. Ask these questions three times, anyone of them.

Now, please take down your hands. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze from their fontanel bone area or on their fingertips, please raise both your hands.

So I bow to you all. Now, life of spirituality and saintliness has started.

Thank you very much.

But I would like to tell them one thing, that when now they go out, tell all the trees, that we have forgotten everyone. Forgiven. I have forgiven myself and I have forgiven everyone.

[Announcement in Italian for the follow-on]
