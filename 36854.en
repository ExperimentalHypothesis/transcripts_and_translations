Bologna Public Program (Italy)

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, we have to know that the truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot describe it, we cannot conceptualize it. Whatever I am going to tell you, you are not to believe me blindfolded, but you must keep your mind open like a scientist. Treat my speech as a hypothesis, and if proved then you must accept it as honest people. It is for your individual benevolence, benevolence of your city, your country, and the whole world.

The truth is that you are not this body, mind, emotions, intellect, ego and your conditionings. But you are the Spirit, the pure Spirit. The second truth is that there is an All-pervading Power of divine love which does all living work. We see these beautiful flowers here and we take it for granted, which is a miracle. In the same way, our body is functioning, our heart is running, and we take it for granted.

Doctors say it is the autonomous nervous system, but who is this 'auto'? In the evolutionary process, we have now reached the state of human awareness. But human awareness is relative. We try to justify everything through our rationality. Hitler could justify his war through his limited rationality. But we have to reach the absolute truth. Unless and until we know the absolute, there will always be fighting and quarrelling going on.

Now, within us is placed, you must have been told, a power, in the triangular bone called as sacrum. That means the Greeks knew that it is a sacred bone. Today the problem is, people do not know the aim of their life, their meaning, why they are living on this earth. Like this instrument, if it is not connected to the mains, it has no meaning. So, this is the power which connects you to this All-pervading Power. The awakening of this power is spontaneous, “sahaj”.

So, Sahaja Yoga means “saha” is “ with you”, “ja” is born, and Yoga is the right to have this union. It is your own power that works it out. It is not just a speech, or a sermon, or a lecture. But it is the actualisation of the experience which is important. And the becoming is very, very essential. That you do not just become, member of this and member of that. It is becoming within yourself. Once you become the Spirit, you start manifesting the beautiful qualities of your Spirit. The Spirit is the source of absolute truth. It is the universal being within you.

Once you get this connection, you start feeling a cool breeze like vibrations, because it is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, we can say, is the biblical word. But in Sanskrit, it is called “Param Chaitanya”. In Koran, it is called as “Ruh” and Patanjali has called it as “Ritambhara Pragnya”. Whatever name one may give, the sensation is of cool breeze from your hands and also out of your fontanelle bone area. Once this power of Spirit starts manifesting, you become, also, collectively conscious.

You see, there are centres through which this power flows. And these centres are responsible for our physical, emotional, mental and spiritual being. So, most of the problems of this world are coming from human beings. And the problems from human beings come because their centres are in jeopardy. So, when this power rises, passes through these centres, it nourishes your centres integrates them and ultimately connects you to this power of divine love. This power thinks, organises. It works like a big computer .Thus you become powerful yourself because you can feel this power on your fingertips. You can feel your own centres, what is wrong with you through self-knowledge, and also through the collective consciousness, you can feel the centres of others. Once you are established in your connection, you can know all about it. You can cure yourself and you can cure others.

Another power of the Spirit is that your attention becomes enlightened. We feel that our innocence is lost in the mundane life of modern style. But innocence is never destroyed. It is only covered with some clouds of misbehaviour, we can say. But after you get your Self-knowledge, your innocence starts manifesting. So, the attention becomes innocent and extremely powerful. You feel your peace within yourself. And the greatest thing that you feel, is the joy. Joy is singular, it is not happiness and unhappiness, but is a state in which you see everything as a drama.

One thing is necessary, is to have a pure desire to have your Self-realisation. Because your freedom is respected. You cannot force Self-realisation on anyone. You cannot pay for it. Because it is a living process. How much do we pay to mother earth for giving us these flowers? She does not understand money, banks or economics. It is love. In the same way, it manifests its love, and a person becomes extremely compassionate and extremely righteous. There is no need to tell, “don’t do this”, “don’t do that”, you just do not do it. It is like , you are holding a snake in your hand and you are in darkness. And if I say “It’s a snake in your hand”, you may say through your rationality, “no, it’s a rope”. And if you are obstinate, until the snake bites you, you will go on saying “it’s a rope”. But supposing there is little light, then you automatically throw away the snake, I do not have to tell you. So, we have to have this enlightenment.

I have to tell you that people have given up drugs, alcoholism, overnight after getting self-realisation. Also, there have been many cases of cures of diseases which are incurable, psychosomatic. You do all this, through your own power. You will know all the modus operandi. You will know how to work it out. Within one month you become your own master. It is all within you. It is too fantastic, that is why we do not believe in it. Suppose you take television in a very remote corner of a village somewhere, and tell someone who has never seen electricity, that you can see everything of the whole world through this television. They will not believe it. They will think it is too fantastic. But when you put this television to the mains, they will discover that it is so.

So, by reading about it, or by standing on your head, or by suffering and sacrifices you do not get. Only through pure desire. Because all other desires are not pure. You have one desire today when it is fulfilled, you have another one, goes on. The pure desire, whether you know it or not, is to become one with this all-pervading power of divine love. This knowledge is like an ocean. In Italy itself, I do not know how many lectures I must have given, but Bologna is one of the last cities I am visiting. You may go on listening to me but it is not important. Like in this hall, there are many lights, and when you come in you have to just put on one switch. Because it is all built-in. But if I have to tell you about the history and all the way how it has come to your city, and here to there, it is all boring. So, the best thing is to get the light first. And then to know all about it.

So, we will have the program just now for about ten, fifteen minutes for getting your Self-realisation. And I am sure you will all get it. Because you are seekers of truth. It is your right to have it. It will hardly take any time, but as I have said, it cannot be forced on you. So, those who do not want to have Self-realisation should leave the hall. It would be very kind of them. It hardly takes any time, but those who do not want to have it, put negative forces. I also know you have lots of questions. But you can write them and send it them over, we will try to answer them.

After this program, there will be a follow-on, where you can come and ask questions. I must say, some of you may get your Self-realisation and you might feel on top of the world. Because you get into the state of thoughtless awareness, where there are no thoughts to trouble you. If you want to think, you will think, otherwise, you will not think. But one should not get lost, because this is a collective happening. If a nail is cut out, then it does not grow from the body. So, for your spiritual growth, you must come and ask for any knowledge that you want to know, get yourself cured and enjoy the bliss of this divine love.

This is real capitalism and real communism. Because you have all the powers, you become a capitalist. And you are the real communist because you cannot enjoy it without distributing it to everyone. I myself, a seventy-year-old lady who has got a very good husband, a very good family, is moving all over the world, giving Realisation, because I cannot enjoy without that. And I have discovered that it is not how much time you spend with your family, but how you spend time with your family is important. In this lecture, I am sorry, I cannot explain to you all the facets of Sahaja Yoga. It is working in fifty-six nations. And you will find your brothers and sisters all over the world. We have a seminar in India for a month and these people come from all over the world. I have never seen them quarrelling, fighting, complaining. But even if one person is hurt somewhere, all of them from all the countries just put their attention to it, rush to it, look after it. Otherwise, also, the time has come for all your problems to be solved by divine love.

May God bless you.

I have to make a very humble request that you will have to take out your shoes because this mother earth helps us to suck our problems. It is better that all of you should be comfortably seated. There are some seats on that side, the backside. It would be better if they come out because I do not see them in front. It is rather cold I think, but it is alright. All of you, please come forward, just come out. These are all seekers, you can see it. At the very outset, I have to tell you, there are some conditions. The first condition is that you are not to feel guilty at all. Like, supposing you feel guilty, then the centre on the left-hand side goes into trouble and creates a serious condition. You may get spondylitis or you may get a disease like angina.

Also, you might get very lethargic organs. After all, you are human beings and human beings have to make mistakes. You are not God. So, do not feel guilty at all for anything. Forget the past. This is one condition. You have to fulfil it. The second one is that you have to forgive everyone. You do not have to think about them because it is a headache. Logically, if you forgive or do not forgive, you do not do anything. But if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands. The people who have troubled you are quite happy, while you are torturing yourself on their behalf. So, be sensible about it and please forgive all of them and do not even think about it because it is a headache. In a way, forgive yourself and forgive everyone.

Also, there is another fashion in the West, I find that people want to feel unhappy and tragic. There is no need to feel that way. You are human beings at the epitome of evolution. And all the blessings are waiting for you. You should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself and have the respect of yourself because you are human beings. These are the conditions, which I request you, that please you just fulfil them because I do not want , this power to stop because you have not fulfilled these simple conditions. Now, there is a little simple thing which I will show you just now because we have to nourish our centres ourselves. This you have to do only tonight with me. You do not have to remember it at all.

So, now with very great respect for yourself and also with very pleasant feelings towards yourself, we start. Please put your left hand, like this on your lap wherever you are sitting, and those who are sitting on the chair should put their feet both separately, because there are two powers, left and right. You need not push back yourself too much now, you need not also slouch, but sit in a comfortable way. The left side is the power of desire and the right side is the power of action. So, we use the left side, putting this hand, which symbolises that you want to have your Self-realisation. And you use your right hand for nourishing your centres. So, he will show you now, that please put your left hand like this and right hand on your heart.

You please do it. Everybody has to do it, otherwise, you can go out. In your heart, resides the Spirit. Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your own master. So, please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Because this is the centre of your mastery.

Now, take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. This is the centre of pure knowledge which is , transferred to your brain. All this you will know later on when you come to the collective. Now please do not doubt yourself.

So, then you take your right hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. We are working on the left-hand side. Now please take your right hand on the heart again.

Now in the corner of your neck and shoulders, where I told you that this centre goes out when you feel guilty.. Now turn your head to your right. I think in this congregation many are feeling guilty. Please do not feel guilty.

Now raise your right hand across your forehead and bend your head as far as possible. This is the centre where you have to forgive everyone without thinking about it. Forgive them in general. Now, please take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. At this centre, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your own satisfaction only, you have to ask forgiveness from this divine power.

This is now the last centre, where you stretch your hand, palm fully. Now, please put the right hand on top of your fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now, please put down your head. Pay attention to the top of your head. Now, it is important to push back your fingers so there is sufficient pressure on your fontanelle bone area. Now, please move your hand slowly, clockwise, pressing the scalp, seven times. Push back your fingers, otherwise, there is no pressure. Now, please close your eyes and do not open them until I tell you . Take down your hands. Now, we start. Please put the left hand towards me properly and those who are sitting on the chair, keep both your feet separately. It is better to take out your spectacles.

Put the right hand on your heart and please close your eyes. Here you have to ask a question which is a very fundamental thing about yourself. You can call me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like. So please ask a question in your heart, not loudly, “Mother am I the Spirit?” Ask it three times. Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your master.

So please take your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and ask me another fundamental question, three times. “Mother am I, my own master?” I have already told you that I cannot force self-knowledge on you. You have to ask for pure knowledge.

Now, please put your right hand on the lower portion of the abdomen on the left-hand side. And here you have to ask six times because this centre has got six petals. Please say “Mother give me pure knowledge”, six times. As soon as you start asking for pure knowledge, this power which we call Kundalini, starts rising. So, we have to nourish our upper centres with our self-confidence.

So please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and here you say with full confidence in yourself, ten times, “Mother I am my own master”. I have already told you, that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, this ego, these conditionings or emotions, but you are the pure Spirit.

So now, raise your right hand up to your heart and here, again with your self-confidence, you have to say twelve times. Here you have to say twelve times with full confidence, “Mother I am the pure spirit”. This All-pervading Power of divine love is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of knowledge. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you have committed, get easily dissolved in this ocean of forgiveness.

So please forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head towards your right. Here you have to say sixteen times “Mother I am not guilty at all”. Say this with full confidence. Now, I have already told you that logically whether you forgive or you do not forgive, you do not do anything. But if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands. You torture yourselves on their behalf. So now you have to forgive all of them without thinking individually about them.

So now please raise your right hand across your forehead, and bend your head. Now here you have to say “Mother I forgive everyone” in general. Not how many times, but from your heart, you have to say, it is very important. Now, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading divine power. Now please take your right hand to the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, please say from your heart, not how many times, “Mother”, or you can say, “oh divine power, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes”. Say it from your heart. Not how many times.

Now the last centre is very important. So now, you stretch your palms fully and put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanelle bone area. Please do not hold your head but push back your fingers. And now please bend your head as far as possible. And n Now move your scalp seven times, but I cannot force Self-realisation on you, so you have to ask seven times for your Self-realisation by saying “Mother please give me my Self-realisation”. Now, please take down your hands and open your eyes. Please put both your hands towards me like this, and watch me without thinking.

Now, please put your right hand towards me and your head down, and see with your left hand, away from the head, to feel if there is a cool or hot breeze coming in your, through your fontanelle bone area. Some get it hot, or cold does not matter. Now, please put the left hand and bend your head. And see with the right hand now, bending your head and check if there is a cool or hot breeze coming out of your head. Once more, you have to do it with your right hand. Put down your head and see with the left hand, if there is a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area or the hot breeze. Some people get it a little far away, some closer, but do not put your hand on your head.

Now please put both the hands like this. And now raise both the hands like this and push back your head. And ask a question. One of these three questions, anyone. “Mother is this the cool breeze of the divine love?” or “Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”, or “Mother is this the param chaitanya?” Ask any one of these questions thrice.. Now, please take down your hands.

All those who have felt a cool or hot breeze, from their fontanelle bone area, or on their fingertips, please raise both your hands. So, I bow to you all. Now, a life of spirituality and saintliness has started.

Thank you very much.

I would like to tell them one thing, that, "When they go out now, tell all the trees, that we have forgiven everyone. I have forgiven myself and I have forgiven everyone".
