聖誕崇拜

印度格納帕提普蕾1990年12月25日

今天我們有這麼偉大的一個機緣來慶祝基督的誕生。祂出生在馬槽中。所有這些事情都是預先安排好的,祂註定是在極其困難的情況下出生于馬槽中,這表明無論你出身貧窮或富有,出生於困境或逆境,只要你內在有神性,它自然會發光。由於基督徒持有一種非常錯誤的、偏離的觀點,所以他們從未能理解基督的意義。對他們而言,純潔無暇的概念是完全不可能的。大多數人認為這多少有點像神話故事。

但在印度我們確實相信,Shri Gauri(錫呂•哥維)用自己的生命能量創造了錫呂•格涅沙,祂成為根輪的神祇。我們接受這個說法。但西方人不接受。他們從來不會接受這樣的事情,因為他們的思維過度發展並且宰製了他們。可能他們並不像印度人這麼歷史悠久,所以他們無法理解到畢竟祂是神。即使對於神的理解也是非常思維化的。而且,基督教所走的路並未為信眾提供任何適宜的指導。相反,凡是遇到挫敗,他們就會說:“這真是無法想像。”但印度人很容易理解——對神來說一切皆有可能。畢竟祂是神,是全能的神,因為西方人的這種思維態度,其層次遠遠低於靈的知識,這類膚淺的知識是平凡的、鎖碎的、它永遠不會讓人接受神的偉大。

我有個奶奶,是我父親的姨媽,她以前常常跟我們講一個很好的故事,故事中有個人準備去見神。當然,在印度,每個人都理解這一切。他們不會說:“他怎麼去見神呢?”但他們就是接受。好吧,他準備去見神。於是當他正走在路上時,他發現一位先生坐在路邊,什麼也沒做,就只是美美地唱著歌,頌贊神的拜讚歌。於是紳士說:“哎呀,你準備去見神嗎?”“是的,我準備去見祂,你有什麼口信要我捎給祂嗎?”“有啊,請告訴祂我一切都好,但祂應該給我安排食物,因為我覺得食物要吃完了。”他說:“真的?那就是你想要我告訴神的嗎?”“是的,是的,請告訴祂。哎呀,當然祂會安排的,但還是請告訴祂。”

於是他繼續趕路,遇到另一位先生,正在倒立,或者如果換成基督教的修行方式,我敢說,他每天衣冠楚楚地上教堂,每天唱著聖歌,聆聽牧師的佈道,隨你怎麼說了;換成印度教的修行方式,我們可以說,他每天都去廟宇,頭倒立,做各種瑜伽體勢和所有(印度教徒要做)的事情。於是那位先生問他:“請去幫我問問神——我已經嘗試了所有的事情,祂什麼時候接見我啊?我想去見祂,得到祂的祝福。”他回答:“好的”。

於是他來到神那裡,做完了自己要做的事後,神便問他:“你有什麼事要告訴我嗎?”他說:“沒有了,但在來的路上我遇到一位先生,他說‘我做了各種事情,嘗試了各種辦法,什麼時候神接見我呢?我倒立,我也做各種瑜伽體勢和各種事情,我也去了教堂和寺院,我祈禱,做各種各樣的禱告,但什麼時候神才接見我呢?’”

神說:“告訴他,他還要再做些事。瞧,這並不容易。當霎哈嘉瑜伽降臨,我們就會見面了。”接著他又說:“還有一個人,也是在路上遇上的,你看。他就在那很享受地唱拜贊,忽然他看到了我,然後告訴我:‘瞧,我的食物現在吃光了,請讓神給我一點吃的吧!’”我說:“真的,食物就要吃完了?”神立即說:“那你在做什麼,為什麼你不去照顧他?他的食物沒了呀。”“哦,不,不,先生,我們昨天已經安排過了,就是這樣”,他說:“好的,沒關係”。

你瞧,他不能理解,你知道,對這個嘗試了所有方法的傢伙,神一個勁說他必須還要等。而那個人只是唱唱拜讚歌,如此而已,這個人尋求神卻一事不做,神為什麼對他還印象深刻呢?

接著神意識到他掉入某種幻象之中,所以神告訴他:“好的,你去告訴他們一件事,向他們兩個說同一件事情,就說:‘當我見到神時,我看見祂讓一隻駱駝穿過了一個針眼’”。他說:“我真的要這樣告訴他們嗎?”“是的,是的,你告訴他們就行了,看看他們的反應。”

於是他往回走,碰到第一個人,他問:“神怎麼說?”那個去見神的人說:“神說‘等到霎哈嘉瑜伽到來之時,我就接見你。在這之前你繼續維持現狀。’”“哦,神啊。霎哈嘉瑜伽什麼時候到來呢?”他又說:“神終究會在某一天接見我的,我希望霎哈嘉瑜伽某天也會來到。”

他很失望。於是他繼續,他問去見神的那個人:“當你去見神時,你看見了什麼?”去見神的那個人說:“我看見神讓一隻駱駝穿過了針眼?”他說:“什麼,怎麼可能呢?這不可能!”“駱駝穿過了針眼,怎麼可能呢?這是不可能的,看看駱駝的塊頭,而針眼那麼細小。它怎麼可能穿過?不,不,不,你只不過是在講故事,因為你見過神,你想炫耀,就是這樣。我,我不相信這種胡言亂語。你在說謊,別打算愚弄我。”

接著去見神的那個人又去到另一個人那裡,此人正在街上美美地吃著東西,去見神的那個人說:“你好嗎?”“我知道在你來之前神就安排好了,我知道終究一切都很好。你看神總是時時刻刻照顧著我。你去那兒見到了什麼?”去見神的那個人說:“我看到全能的神讓一隻駱駝穿過了針眼,簡直是令人驚歎!”

他說:“什麼,驚歎?祂是神,你知道祂是神嗎?神能做任何事!祂能做任何事情!”這下他明白了,如果你知道神是無所不能的,全能的,這並不意味著祂能將喜馬拉雅山搬到馬哈拉施特拉(印度西部邦)來。並不意味著這個!但意味著祂是全能的。意味著祂能做最為精微、最為精微的事情,這樣的事情是我們的大腦,思維層面無法理解的。它超越了人類思維的理解。

這就是神。是祂,創造了人類。如果祂是造物主,祂必定高於我們 。如果一個制陶的人做了一個罐子,意味著他高於這個罐子。罐子不能創造神,即制陶的人。制陶的人製造了罐子,意味著由他製造出來的罐子,是他的某種創造,所以制陶的人必須是比罐子更加有力量。神是什麼,神創造了這個大型電腦,祂必定是這個造物者,但這點讓人難以置信,或者說超越了人類的理解。我們對一切事物都習以為常,可連構成我們自己的一粒細胞,我們也造不出來。我們什麼也做不出來,人類無法創造。如果有石頭的話,當然你可以將其堆疊起來。如果有泥土,你能夠用它搭建某種房屋。那全都是由死物做出來的死物。但你能夠製造一支燒死邪靈的蠟燭嗎?你們已經親眼看見過,在我的照片前那些邪靈被燒死。你能做到嗎?

對於這樣一部盡善盡美的、錯綜複雜運轉著的、精密的機器,也是一部非常有活力、具有爆炸性的機器,它如何運轉來創造人類,創造整個宇宙,創造這些美麗的鮮花、樹木和萬事萬物,目前你們、我們都一無所知。

看看這些繁星,看看它們有多少顆!在這些星星之中,神挑選了大地母親來創造人類。祂怎樣做到的呢?當祂想把自己的孩子送來的時候,祂就能按照自己所想的方式將孩子送過來。如果人們還質疑這點,這就顯示了思維絕對還是處在泥濘之中。所以當聖人,真正的聖人告訴你錫呂•格涅沙怎樣被Gauri(哥維)創造,請接受這確實是可能的。

但請躍入其中,躍入這信心之中,只要你來到霎哈嘉瑜伽,你就能看到很多正在發生的奇跡。接著你能瞭解,這些奇跡正在發生,如果還有別的奇跡需要發生,那麼無論如何它也會發生。我們沒有做任何事情,但一切皆已完成。並且我們不懷疑,一旦你懷疑,你將再次變得和那些深陷沼澤的人類一樣。

我總是說你們現在就像蓮花般開放。你不是在空中飛行,你的根紮在下面。但現在你是蓮花,在蓮花之上,摩訶拉希什米(Mahalakshmi)原理誕生了。摩訶拉希什米原理以悉妲(Sitaji), 羅陀(Radha), 聖母瑪麗亞(Mary)的形象顯現於人間。

傳說,摩訶拉希什米從大海裡出生。“聖母瑪麗亞(Mary)”的意思是什麼?你們知道,Mare的意思是“大海”。祂出生于大海。因此祂本身就是摩訶拉希什米,祂能夠創造一個孩子。有什麼損失呢?祂能做任何事,那就是你必須超越的地方。基督徒必須升進超越基督教,並且必須理解基督降世是多麼偉大的事情,祂就是格涅沙原理的降世。

人們應該嘗試瞭解,格涅沙成為摩訶毗濕奴(Mahavishnu)是件非常重大的事情。格涅沙是濕婆神的兒子。在創造萬事萬物、大氣、所有這些之前,錫呂. 格涅沙是最先被創造出來的,因為祂就是唵(Omkara),而唵是太初之母從濕婆神分離出來時發出的第一音。那個聲音,祂們稱之為"Tan-kar"。從此唵開始了,格涅沙就是唵的化身。所以這個聲音就是格涅沙,是祂的力量,祂是創造中首要的、最重要的,只是為了產生神聖[聽起來像povitrada]]。當這個神聖,這個[povitrada]被創造時,萬事萬物在這個神聖的海洋之中被創造出來。接著祂降世為基督,卻是以摩訶毗濕奴的形象,不是以濕婆神兒子的形象,是以摩訶毗濕奴的形象。那麼誰是毗濕奴呢?祂是錫呂•格涅沙的舅舅。錫呂•格涅沙母親的哥哥就是錫呂•毗濕奴。所以,我們應該說,祂被摩訶毗濕奴撫育,但是,我們可以說,摩訶拉希什米是採納了錫呂•格涅沙的原理的。

在昆達裡尼圖上你能看到錫呂•格涅沙是位於左手邊,連接著左脈,而昆達裡尼在其上方。所以現在發生的是,祂穿越了那個地方,如果要為了救贖而降世,祂必須作為摩訶拉希什米的兒子降世。

因此是摩訶拉希什米養育了祂,或者實際上,我們應該說,摩訶拉希什米在祂之內孕育祂自己為基督,然後祂成為摩訶毗濕奴。在神的家族裡任何事情都是可能的,因為祂們是神。在神的國度,這些事情是如何成就的,這超越了人類大腦理解的範疇。非常難以理解,但現在你已獲得自覺,你能感受到涼風,所以很多新事物會在你身上發生。所以現在相信我,在神和女神之間沒有任何不聖潔的聯姻,祂們內在沒有任何人類的質素。祂們全是神聖的,聖潔的人。

一旦你理解了這點,那麼你就會理解為什麼錫呂•格涅沙必須接受自己作為摩訶拉希什米的兒子,誕生為基督。因為,作為格涅沙,為了救贖,祂必須來到我們的額輪,格涅沙並沒有做救贖的工作,因為在那階段,祂為純真、神聖、和智慧,同時也為毀滅負性能量而生。但是祂也必須上升,只有祂,只有格涅沙才能被帶到這個狹窄的輪穴,額輪。為什麼額輪這麼狹窄?這是件非常科學的事情,今天我就不打算討論這個了。

當我們思考越多,我們就越是跑到右邊或左邊 ,於是原本就狹窄的額輪變得越來越狹窄,確實會持續地變成這樣,完全如此。因此在這個非常精微的區域只有基督可以成為精微的,因為祂是精微之中最精微的。祂甚至比原子還要精微,因為那些在原子中做著對稱或不對稱的運動的生命能量,比原子要精微。並且這就是更為精微的部分。

於是在那極度狹窄的區域內,只有像基督那樣的人格,祂什麼也不是,只是純潔。祂內在沒有別的元素,只有純潔。所有其他的降世神祇都有著五大元素,祂什麼都沒有,祂什麼也不是,只是生命能量。那就是為什麼祂能夠行走于水上,因為祂身體內沒有品質,祂體內沒有物質。除了生命能量本身外,沒有物質,沒有元素。唵在泥土之中變成了格涅沙,或者可以說,唵變成了某種物質,這種物質源自祂的身體,就是生命能量。因此在格涅沙的階段,可以說,生命能量就是以那種方式保存著,但在基督的時代就不再那樣了。

但是在基督死後和復活之後,整個戲劇還在上演,因為就是祂,掌管著我們的復活,因為祂就是門。祂就是道路,因為祂是錫呂•格涅沙。唵即是道路,祂就是門,但祂不是目的地。祂的母親才是目的地。摩訶拉希什米也不是目的地,甚至摩訶迦利、摩訶莎娃斯娃蒂也不是目的地。太初之母才是你必須到達的目的地。

所有這些從未在聖經中說起,因為祂公開活著的時間幾乎不超過4年。他們也不想說起這些,因為他們不知道,而且,所有神聖的事物都受到明顯的壓制,因為這些人都是商業化的機構,就像在印度我們也有各種各樣的商業機構一樣。印度唯一的優勢是宗教沒有被組織。感謝神!他們組織了基督,組織了所有的基督原理,組織了所有的一切,現在他們認為祂是一個好人,給祂頒發了一個怎樣的證書啊!

所以,今天我們在此慶祝唵的誕生,這是件很重大的事件。不知道你們是否意識到它,它是什麼,它滲入萬事萬物,無論是[聽起來像是anu, paramanu]原子、分子,它滲入各種化學品的組成中,也滲入在週期律中,也滲入重力之中,它滲入每樣運動的事物,這就是唵,你的生命能量不是別的正是唵。實際上,在我照片中,生命能量就是以唵的方式顯現。在人們的頭上寫著唵。這是怎麼發生的呢?這些光看起來象唵?在霎哈嘉瑜伽士的頭上,所有的瑜伽士頭上怎會有唵呢?或者阿拉伯語寫成的安拉(Allah),用阿拉伯語寫的我的名字也是如此。

是誰正在成就這些?就是祂,成就了這一切。所以唵本身就以各種形象來做事,以說服你太初之母的存在。祂就是那個掌管所有這些力量的人。祂沒有進入照片,沒有,祂不會的,但祂玩著把戲。畢竟你看,如果你分析細節,你怎麼能照出一張照片呢?通過光,光筆直穿過,一條直線。但如果祂想的話,祂能夠讓光走出另一種圓形的路線。

祂能夠將光變形成為其他的東西。祂能夠做任何祂喜歡的事情。那就是祂的所作所為,為了讓你信服。並且祂說:“任何違背我的事情我都會容忍,但對聖靈的冒犯是不被容忍的。”聖靈就是太初之母。沒有祂你無法到達頂輪,因此整個戲劇中祂就像持線者(sutra dhara),祂就是那個做事者,那個在木偶劇表演中操縱線的人。因此我們每次在崇拜中向格涅沙做禱告是非常重要的。我們得向祂禱告,就如我們向耶穌基督禱告一樣。每次,沒有祂的吉祥,沒有祂的幫助,我們無法成就霎哈嘉瑜伽。祂就是掌管者。看我坐在這裡,而祂是掌管者。試想如果沒有安排我怎能在這裡講話?什麼也不會發生。但祂是如此有效率,而你從未看出是祂成就著事情,做著一切事情。

Translation from Hindi:

You all would not have been able to understand all what I spoke in English.  Today is the Birthday of Shri Issa Masih.  It is the greatness of Issa Masih that I was explaining.  We pray to Shri Ganesha  we sing stutis (praises to Shri Ganesha), because everything says we must sing His praises.  But what is this stuti singing.  What is Shri Ganesha.

We see that He is Omkara.  What is Omkara.  All the workings of this universe happens only by the energy of this Omkara, which we call as Chaitanya, vibrations.  Brahma Chaitanya.  The sakar  (visible form) of Brahma Chaitanya is Omkar, and the (vigraha) embodiment of that is Shri Ganesha.  And, the incarnation of that has come as Issa Masih.  It is imperative that we should understand this; otherwise when we sing stutis to Shri Ganesha we go into a frenzy, like mad people.

Each word that we use for Him, we are enumerating His powers.  Why are we doing it.  Because you have some shakti, another has some shakti, so what is the purpose of pronouncing these shaktis (powers).  The reason is, that we desire that all these shaktis and qualities of His, which we do not possess, should become a part of our beings also.  But His greatest strength and power, is His innocence and holiness.  Whoever possesses the quality of purity and innocence, is the most powerful.  Nobody can touch such a person.  Like soap.  No matter what you wash with it, it does not become dirty itself.  Sometimes even soap can get dirty.  But this is Omkara, which can never lose its purity and holiness.  It is an eternal quality, or it is the shakti of performing totally dedicated work.  (Anan, where there is no other).  So when you adore and worship, you should always remember that we want to absorb this shakti; and it should establish within us the eternal innocence and purity, and all our chakras become cleansed and purified.

Our life becomes (shuddh) pure, our (samaj) society, our (raajkaran) government of the nation, our country, and the entire world all becomes completely cleansed and purified.  And only in that state of purity and virtues, can we have bliss and joy (anand).  It is like, after a bath and change of clothes, you feel the joy of being cleansed.  It feels good.

And when your entire life becomes cleansed with this Omkar, then you get the joy, which is called Aatma-anand (joy of the spirit. You get that.  And even in Atma, the energy that is there, that is also the shakti (energy) of Omkara.

But we do not understand the real significance of Omkar.  We say it is A-U-M and Ardhmatra (half-syllable).  Just by saying this we do not understand the full meaning.  And this Chatwari (four shaktis) of Shri Ganesha,  it is His genesis or manifestation that you get in the life of Shri Jesus Christ.  But He had a public life of only four years.  And for some reason, very little was known about Him in India.  But now the people of the western countries have begun to recognise Him.  But this is only a mental acceptance.  Nothing else.  There is no heart involved.  Only the head.  And such a knowledge is too subtle to enter their brain.

To understand such a subtle knowledge, the brain has to be enlightened.  The aggregate of Divine Rays has to enter the brain, and give it the shakti of sensitivity.  Now if the brightness of these lights comes into the eyes, it blinds you.  But the inner light, when it shines, it does not blind you.  But everything becomes clear and can be understood clearly.

How to get that Light of the Spirit.  The Agnya Chakra which is here, in level with the brain plate. Here, this is where it is located.  Here, the Medha  (intelligence, wisdom) opens out.  It is closed like this, but when in opens, then we see that Agnya Chakra has opened, and then the Kundalini passes inside through this opening, and when She enters the upper part of the brain, above the brain plate; then inside the brain an astonishing, extraordinary thing happens, which is beyond human dimension; beyond the human (buddhi) intelligence.  One gets drenched, inundated, in this divine energy; and you begin to understand what is truth, and what is untruth.  Through this divine energy (Daivi Shakti) you also begin to feel the chakras on the hands.

Gradually you will not need  to feel it on the hands.  You will just know, spontaneously, what is right and what is wrong.  Like it takes time to know what is good and what is bad;  but some people immediately get the indication.  I would say that they have received the blessings of Issa Masih.

The same people are involved in their mental understanding; or caught in the web of class and caste difference; or difference in belief and religion, or judging that Indians are better, or English are better;  narrow mindedness and petty indedness; miserliness and other kinds of useless things.  In our country, I don’t know how, but we get all these parasites like mosquitoes, bugs and other pestilence.  The nasty things we get here, we do not get anywhere else in the world.  The lengths to which people go to fall into ditches, can only be seen here.

Sometimes it is very surprising that in a county which has had so many incarnations, whose culture is so filled with bhakti (religious devotion and piety) and who worship God Almighty, should have fallen into the deep mire of selfishness, rough and rude behaviour, and allowed ourselves to go to rot.  And continue to rot (sadna).  At lease after coming into Sahaja Yoga this should have gone.  But still caste and creed differences;  this, that, and all kinds of prejudices of the world, are making us into creepy insects and worms.

Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.  This Dharma is the dharma of Omkar (mysterious syllable containing the attributes of the Supreme Being).  The dharma of holiness and purity.  And if you are sticking on to these bad inclinations and habits, then you cannot sustain in Sahaja Yoga.  This is not an outwardly show, of saying that I believe in Sahaja Yoga, I do pujas of Shri Mataji, I go to the centre regularly; I keep Her Photograph on the altar in my house, and we worship Her.  Neither will you benefit, nor will the world benefit from this sham and false behaviour of yours.  Any lamp can claim that I am giving light to the world.  One can ask, where is the light.  Show me your light.

We are always deceiving ourselves.  We should make a resolution that, no, we are not going to indulge into this deception any more.  We are going to give up all this, and go into Sahaja Yoga, and go deep.  Only then will you benefit from it.  Now I have seen the half baked people, what happens to them.  May be sometimes, if you have been to a wrong guru, you might have a lot of difficulties.  Or if you mix with bad company also you may land up into difficulties.  Because the time into which you have now come, it is called Krita Yuga, where the Brahma Chaitanya becomes active and effective.  It starts doing its work.  Now, in these circumstances, you can neither deceive yourself or deceive others.  Nor can you deceive Me!  The person who takes to the road of deception, will immediately get the fruit of his actions.

One gentleman came and told Me, that “Shri Mataji when I sit in meditation, my face swells and becomes so big”.  So I said,” Oh, what happens”.  He said, “It becomes big, like Shri Hanuman’s”.  So I said, “Very good.  You are becoming like Shri Hanuman”.  He said – “No, No. Shri Mataji.  It grows so much, I am afraid my face might burst some day”.  So I asked, “Do you chew tobacco?”  He admitted that he did.  So I said – “Better keep chewing tobacco.  Why do you want to meditate”.  They will eat tobacco and they will also meditate.  Then the face is bound to expand.

Another person came and said, “Shri Mataji, this index finger of mind has got cut.  I said, “Oh I see.  Were you smoking a cigarette?”  He said “Yes”.  So he got hurt on that finger.

Another one had a motor car accident.  He came and showed me that only his right index finger got injured.  “I got hurt on this finger because I was smoking”.

You come to Sahaja Yoga and then you continue with your smoking of cigarettes, and drinking alcohol, and a whole lot of other bad practices.  And they will pin a big badge and go about saying “I am a Sahaja Yogi”.  That badge that you are wearing;  that same badge will come and break your head.  I am warning you.  Better understand that wearing My badge is not such a simple thing.  This badge that you are wearing, that will come and break your head.  I do not wish it to happen.  I do not make it happen.  Understand.  This badge is not an ordinary thing.  It is a Vigraha (form or shape of God).  It has a coefficience.  Means, Chaitanya (divine vibrations) flows from it.  That same Chaitanya will twist you.  Then you will say – “Shri Mataji, I was wearing your badge as I slept, then how did this happen.  Why me”.  It was from the badge that  the Chaitanya came and broke your head.  That is why I say, “Don’t wear a badge”.

And, if you do, then be worthy of wearing it.  Nowadays every one wants a badge.  Give me a locket to wear around my neck. Yes. Do wear it. But with great caution.  Do you understand.  Don’t put the blame on Me if anything happens.  Some will say, “Shri Mataji, I wore this badge and went, and still I slipped and broke my leg.”  So better not to wear it casually and carelessly.  If you want to wear, then make yourself worthy of it.  And if you cannot make yourself worthy and still wear it, then God save you from Lord Jesus Christ.  And, Shri Ganesha is more exacting than Him.  He always carries a Parashu (battle axe) in His left hand, and He just wields it and I cannot do anything.  I cannot control them.  They will advise you not to disrespect the badge, and if you do, then take the consequences.  So, wearing of badge, pendant or ring, is very  demanding in its protocols.

When you go into a toilet or unclean places, remove and keep it safe and unexposed.  You must be careful to guard it from unholy environments.  Even My Hair.  If you find it anywhere, you must keep it safely and return it to Me.  Please be very careful.  This Hair of Mine was given by Yama (God of Death), and he is always watchful of it.  So please return it if you find sit, because I am your Mother.  I don’t want you to get into trouble.  But these are not your Mother or your Father.  They are your brothers, and they keep following you with a big rod.

That is why you should understand that you have come into Sahaja Yoga.  It is not a place of enjoyment, fun, and bhajans.  If that was so, from where did the beating come?  This is why you should understand the uniqueness and speciality of Sahaja Yoga.  That this is the kingdom of Paramatma (God Almighty), and Paramatma is not a Mother.  A Mother is loving, kind, and She always feels that, they are still children, and they do things sometimes.  It does not matter.  But God Almighty is watching your behaviour.  Everything has been given to you in Sahaja Yoga after so much care and difficulty by your Mother.  Where are you faltering now.  What wrongdoings are you indulging into now.  And that is why we should be very careful and alert.

I will say this, that Adi Shakti is verily the Shakti, the energy of Paramatma; His Desire.  But Paramatma is constantly watching, that these Sahaja Yogis who are making such a show, how many of them are genuine and honest; and who among these has to be corrected and put in his place.  He is making all these observations.

All those who are good should also get attention.  But this is not what He is doing.  He is only noting down those who are fakes and frauds and need to be corrected.  He will censure and chastise.  That is why it is My sincere advice that whatever you do, do it with a clean, and pure, and innocent mind.  I am openly telling you that if you have any wrong ideas and false knowledge; blind faith in falsehood; any prejudices of caste, creed, colour or community; all of which are unworthy of Sahaja Yogis; you remove all these unwanted things, and then only wear My badge or pendant.  Because with every pendant one Gana is attached, and on duty.  And they are watching you, up and down.  As much as they protect you, in this way also they are preventing you from doing wrong things, because they know you inside out.  So today this is a warning, or notice of danger.

We are also fortunate that Jesus Christ came and established Himself on the Agnya Chakra, and became the cause of our resurrection.  Otherwise resurrection would never have become achievable for  Sahaja Yogis.  His coming was absolutely necessary.  There is no fight or disagreement between anyone.  Everyone knows that on this Tree of Life, all had an important responsibility to develop the tree, so that the Sahasrara could be got ready for the final culmination.  But if there is no tree, from where would the Sahasrara come.  And if the Sahasrara has manifested, then it was the tree which worked out this happening.  It is the responsibility of the tree to protect and look after the Sahasrara, and to destroy any attempt to disturb its completion.

So today is the day, we should recognise and thank Shri Jesus for coming, because without Him our resurrection would not be complete.  When it was told to Shri Ganesha that when the time for resurrection comes, You have to look after Me.  This is what was told to Him.  That when the time for Moksha (deliverance from rebirth) comes, that is the time Shri Ganesha arrives at Agnya Chakra, and protects and takes care of you.

That is why today is a very auspicious day for all of us.  A joy giving day, and also a day when we are warned to be careful.  Because at Agnya if you stray, then you will land in the lunatic asylum, or you will be afflicted with some other disease.  We should maintain holiness of the Agnya, means our thoughts should be absolutely pure and holy.  And as you keep rising, bad thoughts will stop coming.  They will stop completely.

Sahaja Yoga is only for your joy, your greatness, your gravity, your dignity, and your progress.  And after all this, if we do not support the work of Sahaja Yoga, do not encourage the people who are working for Sahaja Yoga, and instead, try to put obstacles in the progress, then such people come in for dire punishment.  Those who are doing the job with full honesty and involvement, we should also support in the same measure.

In some people I see the shortcoming of miserliness.  They save money.  Like – from every quarter that we can save four rupees lets save it.  Save from here, save from there.  Where you are able to save four rupees, you will find that you will have to spend four hundred rupees somewhere else.  And in Sahaja Yoga, sometimes the rupee spent with love and dedication, is equal to a lakh (million) of rupees.  Means, it will actualise in rupees!

We are not donating to Shri Mataji.  Everything belongs to Her.  And we are spending on Her, what belongs to Her.  And you are well aware that I do not accept or expect anything.  From morning till night I keep resisting and saying, please do not give Me any gifts or sarees.  I do not need anything.  For the past five years this tussle is going on, and nobody is willing to accept My refusal.  And as the time passes, costs are going up, but still they will not stop.

But, for the running of Sahaja Yoga money is required.  But here people think it is very clever to get free meals in Sahaja Yoga.  Later on if they have problems with their stomach, I am not responsible.  This place is not for beggars.  It is for the Kings. For those who have (Raja Tabiyat) royal temperament.  If you have kingly qualities you are most welcome.  You don’t have to have wealth.  Just qualities.  The rich are so miserly and wretched, and so strange, that we cannot understand them.  And then there are others like Myself.  Not rich, but large and generous hearted, who want to keep on giving.  If one hand is open you will take. But if the other hand does not open to give, then things will stop coming to you.  That is why, whenever I hear about miserly people, I feel aversion and disgust.  I feel nauseated.

I was so impressed and happy the other day, when we ran out of gifts, people were lovingly accepting My Photograph. “ Shri Mataji, that is all we want”!  That deep satisfaction must come first.  Only after satisfaction the human being can do (tyag) renunciation.  Of course no one can do tyag (renunciation) like Issa Masih.  But that sacrifice should be done with full love.  Yes, there will be a little difficulty.  No problem. But we can know from a special and noble job, that we are not doing it for ourselves, but for every one.

This year I am going to call for a list, especially of the Bombay people.  I have received complaints that they just do not want to pay any money for anything.  And here in Bombay stands the great Mahalakshmi Temple.  What is the use of this temple, where Shri Mahalakshmi Herself emerged spontaneously from the Mother Earth.  How did the people of Bombay become so miserly.  They are thinking that Shri Mataji is spending for everything.  Let us enjoy.  In any case, everything will work out, whether they give money or not.  BUT what will happen to them.  Must remember this.

The sign of Mahalakshmi Tattwa is, that when we meditate and get rid of all our doubts and desires, this Mahalakshmi principle becomes active, and we start searching only for the truth.  If you do not have samadhan (satisfaction), then you cannot enter Mahalakshmi Tattwa.  Take the life of Shri Sita.  How long did She live with Shri Rama.  Shri Radha’s life.  And after that the life of the Mother of Shri Jesus.  In all the three lives, so much of sacrifice and tyag (renunciation).  Without maha samadhan, this could never had happened.

So, with the Mahalakshmi Tattwa, a person becomes maha samadhan (completely satisfied and surrendered).  And then from this plane, he starts searching for the truth, and during the search he keeps shedding all his untruths.

So in this Mahalakshmi Puja, where we are worshipping Shri Jesus and His Mother, Mary, then we should settle in samadhan.  From worldly things, and excessive desires, when we get renunciation inside, only then the Mahalakshmi tattwa awakens within us.  And then the Mahalakshmi within us, starts looking after the Lakshmi tattwa.  And the Lakshmi Tattwa starts getting established by itself.  It gets activated by itself, and gives its benefits by itself.  Everything manifests  and stands before us.

So, the only thing I have to say is, enlarge your hearts.  Make your hearts big, and enthrone the Omkara in your hearts.  That same Omkara which is Shri Ganesh, which is Jesus Christ, through whom all our problems become alright.  Get solved.  And you can have adhikar, (loving entitlement) over Me. Without their presence within you, (Ganesha and Shri Jesus), I cannot give you this privilege or authority!  Even in the rising of the Kundalini, until such time that permission does not come from Mooladhara, till Shri Ganesh does not give the signal; no one, not even I, can raise the Kundalini.  They have their own adhikar (entitlement) over Me.

If someone begins to think that he or she is very close to Me, they should understand that even if they are close, genuinely they are close, then it is only with the permission of Shri Ganesha that the proximity has been allowed.  With the permission of Issa Masih.  Without His permission I do not recognise anyone.  This is a (bandhan) binding on Me.  And this is why I tell you, again and again, be careful!  We must obey His bandhan, and whatever He thinks or knows about you, I have to take that into consideration.  No matter how much I forgive in Motherly love, I cannot disregard their permission, and we must know that they are the ones who actually help us and cleanse us.

They do forgive.  But they have one condition  I have no conditions or requirements.  I am Nirvaaj (without expectations of returns).  I do not desire anything from you. However you are, in whatever state you are, you are acceptable to Me.  But in Their judgement, if you have ever, disrespected or disobeyed Me; or in Sahaja Yoga if you have committed any acts of dissension or put obstacles; or cheated or been dishonest; These will get after you.  That is why I am telling you, again and again, that today, on this auspicious occasion, you should know what powerful shaktis are standing with you.  Why don’t we honour these shaktis and imbibe them like royal people.  When we have such an elevated throne (singhasan), why don’t we ascend and take our seats on it.  And live in that royal style that behoves royalty.  You are now Sahaja Yogis.  It is such a great thing.

And so many yogis have come to this Ganapatiphule, where Shri Mahaganapathi presides in this place.  We have come here as family of Mahaganesha.  Into His kingdom.  And with His blessings all the great shaktis are inside us.  But even to absorb this shakti, we have to be in purity and bhakti.  In His bhakti, there is no place for Swarth (selfishness, self interest).  If we can achieve this state, then He looks after the rest.  Then He is at your service. But if you take the wrong road, he can cause you a lot of damage.

I am teaching you a few words of common sense.  Because a Mother feels that these are My beloved Sons, and you should benefit from Them. At the same time there is fear that they may twist your ears.  That is why I am explaining to you  that we are here as a big family.  We have united.  But these Elder Brothers you will have to obey, and be aware that they are sitting here and watching carefully.  And by doing puja we can pacify and make them happy.

But nothing happens speedily,  until and unless there is inner cleansing.  So we have to make a commitment that we are going to give up all impurities and turn our attention to purity, and make our lives worthy.  If we do this then there are only blessings, and more blessings.  My eternal blessings, and thanks that all of you have come.  The thing is that My heart is overflowing, as all of you are there within Me.  I love all of you, and My loving glance is always on you.  And I am always thinking of protecting you.  My Attention is always on you.  And if you have any problems you can write to Me.  But you must cleanse yourselves.  Become pure, and become auspicious, and enjoyu these endless blessings forever.
