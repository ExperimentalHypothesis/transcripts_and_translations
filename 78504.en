Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

At the very outset, we have to know that Truth is what it is. We cannot organize it. We cannot conceptualize it. Also, unfortunately, we cannot know it at this human awareness. This is the reason for all the human problems. We do not know the absolute Truth nor do we have the absolute Knowledge.

The Truth that I’m going to tell you today, you need not to accept it blindfolded but you should have a scientific outlook to keep your minds open because it’s a new dimension, a new area, about which I’m going to talk to you. And if this is an hypothesis which I am putting before you, and if it is proved, then as honest people, one has to accept it because it is for the benevolence of every individual, of every country of the whole world.

Here is now the mechanism by which we are going to know the Truth – again I say don’t accept it –, and the Truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this ego, you are not these conditionings, but you are the Spirit, you are the pure Spirit. So, for the next age which is going to come, the basis of that has to be Truth; we cannot live in Falsehood anymore, we have had enough of it. You have played games, and it’s better that you finish it now and take to Truth, that we are all – or can be – the pure Spirit.

The second thing that we have to know is that there is an all-pervading power, a subtle power, about which you are not aware but you have read about it. It’s mentioned in the Bible, it’s mentioned in all the scriptures; in the Quran, it is mentioned as Ruh, that this subtle power of Divine Love does all living work: you see these flowers, they are so beautiful; we take them for granted. We don’t even think how an ordinary little seed can create such beautiful colours. How it works out? How this living process takes place? We have become human beings from amoeba state. We don’t even think how did we become, what force has worked it out; we just take everything for granted, but there must be something that has done this job. And all this living work is done by that subtle divine Power of Love. So, the second foundation of the next age, of the new age, should be pure Divine Love. If these true foundations are not laid down in the nations and in the human beings, whatever you may try, any amount of organisations you may have, you cannot deliver the goods because human beings have to be transformed. They are at the stage where they do not know the Absolute, which is so beautiful; the Reality is so beautiful that there is divinity in all of us, all of us have that divinity within us, and that divinity we have to reach. For that, we don’t have to work: it is sahaj, which means that it is spontaneous, because it is a living process. When we sprout a seed, what do we do? We just put it to the Mother Earth. There is a built-in possibility in that seed, and a built-in possibility in that Mother Earth which sprouts the seed, spontaneously. It does not have to be taken upside-down or taken to a laboratory or to a guru, or to anyone.

Least of all, you cannot pay for it. And when there are people who are seeking Truth, they don’t realize that Truth, you can only have it spontaneously, and you cannot pay for it. This is a very big misunderstanding about the seeking. There are so many people in this world who are seeking the Truth, and they are so many who are in the market. They are marketing Untruth. If you have to find Truth, you cannot pay for it.

I was amazed: in America, a country that is supposed to be very enlightened, on the television, they talk like this: “if you give one note of $100, you will get $1000”, and then a telephone number; is that the telephone number of God Almighty? But people do it! What is happening to their brains, I don’t understand; or is it all brainwashed with all your advertisements and these glossy talks that people give? That people have lost the idea that you cannot pay for it. Get any of these scriptures, read them, and find out how much money did you pay to Christ, or much money was paid to Mohammed Sahib. Any person who takes money in the name of God or in the name of higher awareness is a cheater, and you must understand that. I have to tell you this because I am really surprised that on the television they talk like this, and people are paying money like this. One after another; so many from my country came here and have looted you all, and still they are going on like that. How can you believe such things? After all, you are all people with brains.

And this is what is the most dangerous thing, that this age has a foundation of money. This age in which we live has a foundation of money. There are no principles any more. Anybody can compromise. We talk of big principles, that this country is standing for that, and that country stands for that but when it comes to money or to power, everything finishes off. And just we think of nothing but these false things, which can never bring joy to any individual, or to any group, or to any country. It’s a fact.

If money had given us that joy, then why people who are very affluent like Switzerland – of course, they are rich, supposed to be – and other countries like Norway, Sweden, are competing in committing suicide. Why in the affluent countries, people are going amok and getting to diseases like AIDS and other things. You must think about it: it is because they are frustrated. They haven’t got what they have been seeking. They haven’t got anything for their satisfaction. So, we have to turn our eyes to the fact that we haven’t got what we really needed, which should have really satisfied our goals. And this is what first we should realize, that at human awareness we haven’t achieved that, which will give that peace, that benevolence, that joy and that collectivity. You know that my husband has been working with United Nations for so many years, and they said he was a good worker and all that; but he also felt the same way that human beings have to be transformed. No organisation can work out unless and until human beings themselves are transformed to that state where they feel that the whole world is one.

Within us lies this power which in Sanskrit language they call as Kundalini. Kundal means the coil. It is a Sanskrit word, but Kundalini because it is a feminine energy. We have God the father, God the son and no Mother, you see. How can there be a father and a son without a mother? Logically! Who is the Mother? Mother is the Primordial Mother who was accepted and has been described in Greek mythology as Athena. In every mythology, there is a Goddess; but in some way or other they avoided to talk about Her, and this is also responsible for certain mistakes we have been committing. This is the Power which gives you the Realization. It is described in the Quran also as Asas. In the Quran where Mohammed Sahib has done the latest work on Kundalini: He says that when the Resurrection Time will come, your hands will speak, very clearly as it! But they are not looking out for resurrection. Christ has said "I’ll send you the Holy Ghost who will comfort you, who will counsel you and redeem you". They are not looking out for the Holy Ghost. That means that it’s some sort of a person, Holy Ghost cannot be a dove. How can we have counselling from a dove? So, in all the religions it is described that you have to have your second birth; you have to be born again.

So now, I put a certificate myself, saying "I am born again". I am not Secretary General of United Nations, but supposing I’ll put a brand on my (Shri Mataji shows the top of Her forehead), will I become? If you are now something, you must have the power of that position, you must have the knowledge of that position, otherwise how can you be at that position. And this is what is going on that we call ourselves as Christians without following Christ, we call ourselves Hindus without following Krishna who said that the Spirit is in every human being, so how can we have castes. We are not following what they have been telling us; but we just think that we are alright, we are following the theology. Theology is only words, but even to follow a religion you have to be born again, in the sense you should have your Self-Realization. Like this is [UNCLEAR – 14:27] you see, unless and until it is connected to the main, it has no meaning; in the same way, unless and until we are connected to this Power, which is so great that I cannot describe it during this small lecture. This is the Eternal Power which exists, and unless and until we are connected with That – that is Yoga –, we cannot understand what we are and we cannot benefit from the great Power that is surrounding us.

So now, in the evolutionary process, this is the last break through we have, which is to be experienced, and you must know the modus operandi. This is a very important thing which people miss. The other day, somebody came and started shaking before Me. I said: "What’s the matter?". He said:"I went to a guru". "Then, what happened?" "He gave me initiation" "How?" "He did something". "But do you know how to give initiation? Do you know the modus operandi? Can you relate it to the medical terminology?". "No, nothing". "So what’s that? What has happened? What have you got?".

Divinity is a seedling, is beautiful, that is within all of us. It’s all residing there, all the time; you have to just touch It. And how beautiful it is made, just see! There are books written about Kundalini, that Kundalini does this and Kundalini does that; it’s all non-sense I assure you, believe Me. Kundalini is your Mother; when you were born, your mother took all the pains upon herself. She didn’t give you any pain. This is your Mother, your individual mother; She knows all about you. And how beautifully She rises, knowing Her child, and how She gives you Realization by passing through the six subtle centres and piercing through your fontanel bone area. This is the Actualisation of the baptism; this is your second birth.

As you see here (Shri Mataji points to the chart), there are two institutions which are built up, due to the activity of the right side and the left side. The right side gives you a balloon called ego, and the left side gives you a balloon called superego (you can call it as conditionings). These two institutions form a cluster on your limbic area and cover it. And this soft bone gets covered like this; it is calcified. In Sanskrit, a person who knows the Brahman, this All-Pervading Power, is called as a Brahmin or a Dvijaha, means born twice. And also a bird is called dvijaha because the bird is in the egg; it is first born as an egg, and then it becomes a bird.

So, when this Kundalini first passes through these centres, She nourishes them. She nourishes those centres which are the energy centres for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. For example, say these are the centres from left and right joined together (Shri Mataji shows the chakra structure with Her hands) and, say you are working very hard, then the right side is going this way (going to the extremes of the right-hand side) and they are getting smaller and smaller. Now, something happens: it breaks (Shri Mataji jerks Her hands apart). When it breaks, then you get psychosomatic troubles, like cancer, like so many diseases which are called as incurable. I am happy to tell you: with Kundalini awakening, many cancer patients have been cured.

It’s your own power which rises, nourishes it, passes through these centres, here and here, and joins them together, nourishes them, and then connects you to the main. All the time, that Energy starts flowing through and you become a dynamic personality. Dynamism is there, but no aggressive; you become an extremely compassionate, loving and a peaceful personality.

We talk of Peace foundations; I’ve known many people who have been given Nobel Price of Peace, and I don’t know what sort of Nobel Price we give them, but one thing have fallen down, that there is no peace in their hearts. They are extremely hot-tempered people, and if you have to meet them, you’d better use a barge pole. Surprisingly, how can you have peace when there is no peace in your heart? But when this Kundalini rises, She achieves that state of peace. How? If you are on the periphery on the wheel, the wheel is moving, but supposing that by chance you go to the axis of the wheel, the wheel, at that point, is peaceful. That’s exactly what happens to you that you reach at that point of peace. Then, the so-called tensions, the modern word stress, just disappear: you get a balance, a complete balance.

But you get the power, power to give Realization to others, to cure others, to help others. You know the complete modus operandi of the whole thing. And above all, you develop a new awareness called as collective consciousness. That works on your central nervous system; it’s not mental, it is beyond the mental state. Whatever we have got in our evolutionary process is evident in our central nervous system.

For example, if there is a dog, it can pass through a dirty lane; but human beings cannot, because they have developed their selves in their evolutionary process. This evolutionary process has not stopped; we have not reached that absolute personality, we have to reach that. Your attention itself becomes enlightened. As I said, you start feeling this all-pervading power as waves of cool breeze in your hands. You start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost – the Holy Ghost is this Kundalini – coming out of your fontanel bone area. With this enlightenment, you can feel your centres – (Shri Mataji shows her left palm, counting the fingers, then the base of the palm, then the centre of the palm) five, six and seven on the left side and seven on the right side – ; these centres are absolutely at the endings of the sympathetic nervous system – on that part, doctors agree. Once you know how to get these centres cured or nourished, you are alright. And if you know how to do it for others, they are alright.

So, when you feel on your central nervous system, the word used for that in Sanskrit is Buddh, from where the Buddha has come. Buddha got His Self-Realization, that why He was called as Buddha; otherwise, He was Gautama. So, also the word Veda – ve-da – means the same that you have to feel it on your central nervous system. It’s the Gnyana – gn- –, again it’s a Sanskrit word, meaning the knowledge. It does not mean the knowledge of the books. It means knowledge on your central nervous system. Even the early Christians were called as Gnostics. You must have read the book written by someone who has found out when Thomas went to India, he has written some treaties and he has found out, in a big jar, things written about Gnostics. And this is what he has written that you have to experience yourself. All that I am telling you is already written in that book. This was found out 48 years back and now it is being recorded.

With all these things, why should we not get our Self-Realization, when it is so easy, when it is so simple? Because you cannot force; your freedom is respected very much; because later on, you become absolutely free, in the sense, you can bear your power, you can bear your money, you can give up any habit you want; you become so strong, so powerful and so free. Last but not least, the Spirit is the source of Joy. Joy is not happiness and unhappiness; it is singular. In that, you see the whole world as a drama and you know what the problem is. I would say that first the state that you achieve is thoughtless awareness, then doubtless awareness, and then you become a yogi, a Sahaja yogi.
