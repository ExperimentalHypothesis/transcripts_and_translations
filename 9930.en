Shri Mataji: Oh! Who has done this painting here? Very good idea.
Guido: This is a copy of the one that has been made by Herbert.
Shri Mataji: Ah.
Guido: In Vienna.
Shri Mataji: But it’s big work, much bigger, much bigger.
Guido: Yes. And also, there is the deity on his eyelash.
Shri Mataji: Yes. And everything is so beautiful, I tell you, really.
It’s really beautiful. Please, be seated. Extremely beautiful. A very nice place, Feels so fresh here, very, very fresh. So nice. Imagine what a place! [In Hindi: Very Beautiful] It’s god sent.

Guido: All wood is so natural
Shri Mataji: And also, you see, to have such a big hall, such a big hall!
Guido: Yes. We can have 300 people. 300 hundred people can be here.
Shri Mataji: Live here?
Guido: Can be -
Shri Mataji: Seated. Hmm. It’s beautiful. [Hindi] It’s god sent, I tell you. As if for [inaudible].

Beautiful.

Anyway, pleasant and nice place. So now what do we do?
Guido: Dinner, we have dinner.
Shri Mataji: Dinner. And then we can talk to these people.
Guido: Yes, Mother. You prefer it here or in your room?

Shri Mataji: When did you come all of you? You came this morning?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, with the train.
Guido: They came by train, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: I See!
Guido: First, our Ruth is here.

Shri Mataji: Ah, Ruth! How did you come? By train or by-
Ruth: By plane. Aeroplane, Shri Mataji.
Guido: Aeroplane.
Shri Mataji: Aeroplane, I see. Is there a direct plane?
Ruth: No.
Shri Mataji: You had to go to Geneva.
Ruth: No, in Nice, in France. It does a stop in Nice
Shri Mataji: You had to go to Nice?
Guido: But from Strasbourg.
Shri Mataji: You are in the South of France?
Ruth: It’s transferred Nice in Heathrow.
Shri Mataji: Oh! You had to go to the South and then get it there.
Guido: No, no, she got it in Strasbourg, but she made a stopover in Nice.
Shri Mataji: I know. Because this is- once you remember, I went to Nice and they said I have to come from Nice to Italy by plane.
Guido: I don’t remember.
Shri Mataji: Yes, I think, it was in 81. Or 80, I think. 80, 1980 when I went to Nice.
When did I go to Nice, you remember that?
Ruth: 80 probably Shri Mataji!
Shri Mataji: 80, yes.
Ruth: Yes.
Shri Mataji: And from there I came here. Yes.
Ruth: With Catherine, yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Yes, I came from there to Italy. I remember. And something had happened about it. I came to Italy and then we-
Ruth: They did not make the publicity, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ha! That was a long time back. That was when I came in – a long time back.
The first time, the first time, when I came to Italy, they did not make any publicity. They took a lot of money from us for that. Yes, that’s it. They did not do any publicity whatsoever. Yes.
Guido: Would you like to have your dinner here or in the room?
Shri Mataji: I think in my room, would be better.
And then we will talk on the phone.
Guido: Yes, Mother
Shri Mataji: To these people. I must see your photographs also.
Sahaja Yogi: Are they here?
Shri Mataji: Today I saw a beautiful one, he showed.
Guido: Yes.
You saw, there were all vibrations from here to here, Rustom, did you see that?
All white vibrations from here to here, all completely.
Rustom: I saw that one.
Shri Mataji: Saw the vibrations, it’s [inaudible].

Guido: He makes always beautiful photographs.
Shri Mataji: They do. You gave very nice photographs to Rustom. You have done it?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: But even Dullio has done very good photographs. And I was telling this gentleman, who is an artist, who was there with us. What is his name?
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible].
Shri Mataji: Ah. I told him that you should take his photographs. One of them is on the right-hand side to my head, you see, on the right-hand side, The smiling one. I said, "That’s quite human, you’d better to do that one first. But the divine photographs are rather difficult to do into art. But this, he can do, I think. He’s quite definite. The one in which I am smiling on the right-hand side. Yes, cameras are very clever these days, I must say, very clever!

So, how many of you are living here?
Guido: Twenty adults and five children.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. That’s good! [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]
You are very much changed, isn’t it? Looking much happier.
Guido: In such a short time.
Shri Mataji: I mean, I was saying, where is your husband? She said, "He is sitting there". I just couldn’t make it out which one was that? So much changed!
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]
She thinks, we feel like India here. Me too, our old houses, we all had these things, you see, in our old houses. Absolutely like this.
All right! [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]
May God bless you!

There is a custom in India. Anybody comes in, then you give him something to eat and then some water. Firstly.
Guido: What is the meaning? I mean, it’s something symbolic
Shri Mataji: Then, accord him what you like. First, have something. If nothing, the religious, they give you jaggery. You know, the kind of a sweet thing we have left out of sugar, Jaggery.
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]
They gave it for the Goddess, whether she eats or not, she is [inaudible]

May God bless you!
