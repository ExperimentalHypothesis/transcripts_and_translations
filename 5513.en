Public Program. Caxton Hall, London (UK), 17 July 1978.

Shri Mataji: How are you?
Yogi: Muffled reply, not too bad

Shri Mataji: not too bad, everyone improving gradually. Yes? How are you? You are always fine,
Look at that, he's fine he is born realised. The whole world is horrid isn't it? Ha ha ha ha for a realised soul it is so. I am surprised the way things are in the west (It is shocking?)
How many have come for the first time? Please raise your hands, who else? You? Three four of you Have you? You have got it, you have got it, what about you? You have come for the first time?

Yogi: no, last time

Shri Mataji: no? Not for the first time, what happened? Did you feel alright? Good. How did you feel? Good

Shri Mataji: Agnya, you were there too ??, first time alright. What we can do those who have come for the first time should either sit on that side, I mean it should be quite obvious you see. I would like to see their Kundalinis come up. If you sit that side it will work out, or in the front would be better. In the front row would be better yes you see I think yes that would be better so that you give them a support from the back, those who are already realised. Ha ha ha ha. Gavin you sit here next to me, this is your position, alright, good.

Please come forward, please all of you. You came here last time? Did you get the vibrations, did you feel the cool breeze (???) Alright then what do you do? Every, every every stage, everything is not (real?), there are things, but there must be some reality. You see every copy comes out of some absolute. There has to be somebody absolute otherwise how do you get the copy? There has to be something, truth, otherwise you cannot get the point so I said this is too much. That means when you go on denying things will you (even?) deny the truth? Then why seek? And this is what happened with him? But still you know you cannot convince these things because the brain starts working too fast with that, Krishnamurti style, you know, I have seen Krishnamurti is this guru coming out with all kinds of brainy waves they have, really brainy people, poor things, you know what happened, one of them was the grandson, the grandson of this (Sounds like Lidibaba) Have you heard of him Lidibaba who was the guru of this yoga. Now this yoganath never realised neither his guru Lidibaba. Now if I tell that people will say Mother what are you saying, but that's a fact, I have to tell you the truth, isn't it how can I tell a lie? They never had their realisation. Now, this one comes to me, his grandson, he told me Mother I don't think you can really give me realisation, and can I ever achieve it. I said what has happened with you? But a great analyser and witnessing himselves. He said first I was the grandson of Lidibaba naturally I have to do Kriya yoga because that is what I inherited with everything else. Whatever money they earned I inherited. So he said that because I was the grandson of Lidibaba I had to take to Kriya yoga. In Kriya yoga you cut your tongue.

Hello Ronnie, how are you?

Ronnie: Muffled reply
Shri Mataji: Good Good, I am happy that you say that, sit down, sit down, come along, take out your shoes, be comfortable......... and this gentleman who came to me he said first I did Kriya yoga now in Kriya yoga imagine, what do you do?.
You have to cut your tongue here downwards, imagine, imagine, push it back, to touch it here see and sit in that condition for at least one hour practically, there, so these people always have their tongue coming out. Then you have to do another thing is to fix your attention here (?) and go on

looking at something and all sorts of things so that always their eyes are like this. Suddenly talking you find that they have gone (???) Every method of destroying yourself, every method that Kriya Yoga.

We had one doctor in India, he died now. I mean we tried and tried but he couldn't talk because they had cut his tongue, he couldn't hear because they had done something to his ears. He couldn't see me square because his eyes were always going this way, that way, and I said now this kind of a great personality what am I to do with him. You cannot fix his eyes you cannot fix his nose you cannot fix his tongue and everything he has done, absolute complete destruction of himself. Now what am I to do, so who has done this.

He said I went to Los Angeles I spent so much rupees, went there and stayed there. What has been done? I said but why, Why did you do it? After all you should have thought of it, anybody in our country we have had (???) he was an Indian. I can understand you people doing that because you don't know, but he knows, which Saint in this country who had a tongue cut and put it back and he said to me he said but they must have done it, I said if they would have done it they would have written it somewhere "How do you know? But it is a very difficult thing Mother". I said whatever difficult it may be it is never tongue cutting. This was Mr Kriya Yoga. Right, so the Kriya Yogis come to me first and they argue with me how can it be that simple, I said If it is simple it is simple. Now see my house from Caxton Hall it is hardly 5 minutes walk, now somebody goes on arguing with me how can it be 5 minutes, but it is 5 minutes, what am I to do if it is so, can you help it? It is spontaneous it is the easiest thing, simplest thing, but people go on arguing how can that be that simple? Has to be, because then there are some.....I mean in this kundalini awakening also the second part where still is done Krishnamurti doesn't come in this is the second part is Krishnamurti style but you see the first part is kundalini awakening. I told you about a man who came to me in Kolapur, and he was sitting just in front you see. And he put his feet like this, so Indians know that you can't put your feet towards your Guru person, so they said what are you doing, you are not supposed to do like that. He said please allow me to do that I said. Why? He said you know if I sit like this I will start jumping like a frog. I said why? because my kundalini is awakened. People said your kundalini has awakened and that's why you have to jump like a frog? Yes my Guru has told me. So he has sent you to me has he?

How can you become a frog in your evolution? You are to be something higher you have to behave in a much higher way than to jump like a frog. He said no no, it is written my Guru has written a book and I will show you, so he praised the book of his Guru (??) just imagine. Very great name that fellow had you know I never knew he was such a horrid thing, and in the book it was written that some people with the awakening of the kundalini where they start jumping like a frog I said now what am I to do?

You do not jump now, if you do not jump what can I do about it, you do not jump like a frog or anything it's all nonsense, some sort of a, sort of a, I should say a stimulus has set in I think something like that and it's a reflex action goes on like that, or some sort of a spirit or something, because this is all absurdity it never happens there. But a book has been written and they have thousands of disciples, I think now what to do, and in that great country India where you gather people know what is religion, what is God, I was amazed at that. So things like this one after another, (then the second part where, Bala is a great seeker you see, really a great seeker. So he went to the second part of thinking and he got fed up of all the gurus and nonsense and the amounts they took out from him. The money that he had to give them and all that. So he said this is not, this is not, this is not. So he went to another fellow who was Mr Krishnamurti who has a voice and talks like (Shri Mataji does an impression of the deadly serious voice of an alleged guru.). I went to his program also, I went to see, I went to all of them, actually very serious something miracle of Delphi was about to speak I said this fellow is not even realised, what is he going to tell you, but still I was just wondering he might say something sensible. So, all that he said was you are your guru, there is nobody else you are your own guru, be yourself, that is what you have to seek. Now how do you do it? So all these people who went there, when you talk to them you find that Mr Krishnamurti has come up. So this fellow he told me, he told me that Mother

you cannot cure me. That then I went to Mr Krishnamurti and he has taught me this he told me that don't believe in any Guru, so I don't believe in any Guru, but then I later on discovered that on one side I am Lidibaba and on the other side I am Krishnamurti. I can give lectures like Lidibaba And also like Krishnamurti whichever one you want you can put my tape and I can start and I can even speak better than Krishnamurti, you want to hear me? Then he sat down he took hold of my sari and he said let me cover myself.

And he really copied him very well, he said now do I look like Krishnamurti. I said really you speak like him and he said Mother I have not achieved it. Now can you imagine.

I must tell you I am sorry, so far I have not been able to do anything for him. Every day, time I go to India he comes to me, but now he feels very shy, he comes to me privately, but his kundalini comes up and falls down, rather, rather difficult because it's too much you see seeking they have fallen into so many ditches. But one day it will come I am sure it will work out because he is a good man and he has suffered for nothing at all you see because of his seeking, and all such people will be blessed no doubt because they didn't do anything wrong they just went because of their seeking in seeking if you go to someone and they do them harm (???), then rest assured they will be absolutely looked after, it is the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoga and myself, to see that all the people who are genuine must get their realisation which is their birthright. You all must get it, it is their own, because it is their very own so they must get it, but as I told you there are many hurdles and we have hurdles you see pertaining to every styles of our living it is a surprise. We accumulate the way we live, in what conditions we live, under what atmosphere we live, and as we are here mostly western people hardly any Indians, we have to face our problems as westerners, and the problems of westerners are really complicated, the same way as I would say that in the beginning they had to go to their ego orientation because they had to develop their country. For example Caxton Hall was not there say for a few years back nothing was here, this was a place called as Londes, London was Londes and Londes means the place, which is, Lon means mud, and this was nothing but just mud here, and it's such a cluster of mud was there that people had to dig in to make houses deep down, that is why we have so many basements here. Perhaps you may not be knowing this but that is how London was built. All these bridges and all these undergrounds were built because of that so it's sort of a, its a, its a sort of say a blessing in disguise that we could have the best tubes things because we had lots of money here and out of that out of that mud we had to create a city and a city and not only city but a nation and naturally the people had to work very hard for that and life was very hard, and that they had to build that and then gradually when the science exposed itself to the power of giving a special facility to human beings. You see the whole attention, the whole attention of all of the western countries went to science And they started exploring how they can master the matter, how can they can get come up, how can they do something better. Then when they mastered also matter and all that in that they started seeking again, are we going to make life easier, happier, and joyful, of course the life became easier in a way but in a way difficult. The way it was easier was this that definitely you have cooking ranges and you have got what you call these vacuum cleaners and everything much simpler than the people who have to do everything with their hands, and they don't do that good sometimes maybe as we can do with machines, some of the cleaning processes, maybe, but maybe the art part they do better. But the difficulty came in when we did too much of ego orientation, we worked on the right hand side of our sympathetic nervous system which we call as the manifestation of the pingala nadi, ego orientation. Now this is the right side is completely managed by the power of Mahakali is the power is Sanskrit word because I can't say help it, but we can say is the power of doing something, Kriya is to do something . So naturally when somebody has to do you think of the future all the time, this I am going to do, this I must organise all the time this I must put this right, this I must do. Despite all this organisation what we find we are very much disorganised within ourselves, so what has happened with this, even we have organised our religion which was the greatest hit I think happened because religion is something that has to be left to yourself. It is your own thing, which you have to seek yourself, you cannot organise religion because it is Gods own giving. You have to leave space for his work. On the contrary if you say make it into a machine like way. Or if you can ask some priest to pass through some theological college and graduate in charge of that, you can never go near because they are

the people just like us and we can not have faith in them. There is nothing special about them. That is why the religion became absolutely rigid, actually you lost all your freedom that was spiritual you would be amazed you have political freedom, you have economic freedom, but you have lost your spiritual freedom because of this. I do not say that there is anything wrong with having churches or having temples, but there is definitely wrong to have them the way we have them, it is such a compact style, you see you go there you put down your name, they put the water on your head, you become a Christian you cannot, to become a Christian is the most difficult. You can be Hindu but you cannot be a Christian . Christian means a person who is baptised, means whose is realised, whose Brahmarandra is broken, who is at the top of the fontanelle bone, is cleared out, who is absolutely baptised is the Christian, not the one who goes and takes communion with beer and scotch even. But cannot be a realised soul. A realised soul means a person whose sahastrara is open who has become one with the Divine, who has become one with the collective consciousness it is something that is a happening within, who is a reborn person who is a twice born as Christ has said. It is not the way people say, that come along now say at the age of say ten months or so when you don't understand anything you go to them and they put their hands on your head, actually it is very dangerous take it from me, why? Because the children's the Brahmarandra or fontanelle bone is very soft and that time these unauthorised people who are anti Christ they are all anti Christ because they have no authority to preach about God. They put their hands there to spoil it. First thing the Kundalini is spoilt. No priest in India would touch him he would not, no priest would touch him, you ask him to touch him he would say no no I cannot . You try it and do it anybody, even a Muslim priest would not touch. Only a Christian has that much of an ego, because it is sinful to touch anybody's Kundalini within. So no Hindu will touch here at the most they will touch here, but not, they will not touch this part, you can go and find out from even from the greatest Rakshasas I call them, these devils who have come as fake gurus. They will not touch here either because that means you are just putting hands onto the point where you will be really burnt.

So you can imagine by this kind of graduates who do not know anything about inside, suddenly becoming your priest, how can you have respect for anyone who is nowhere near spirituality he's just a priest? So such a great religion which requires people only who are baptised just imagine has been thrown to dogs. To People who do not know what that is, who do not know what it is. Who do not know how to achieve self realisation those who do not know what is self. They do not know the manifestation of anything, only there where they take money from you, make some diamonds wear on your body and walk seriously to say to the pope, how does he become a pope I do not know. It is understanding that will lead you there, not any kind of a reactionary methods, but understanding of the reality and the understanding of the reality is that if you have to be Christian you have to be a realised soul, otherwise you are not, so all Sahaja yogis are really Christians in their Indian, Indian or we can say style of religion which we call as Vijaha Vijaha (SM says something in Sanskrit) twice born. The one who is born again, the second time he is born. Like we can say the birds are also born Vijaha they are first born as eggs, we are born as eggs our ego and superego makes us an egg. We are like a shell, it has to be there, to have our 'I' ness to have our freedom to choose between right and wrong and then the shell may be matured and the Mother can break the shell and you become a second person a person who is twice born. This is what is really baptism. It is a happening, you cannot give somebody a brainwash about it. You cannot say you are a Christian, you cannot brand someone, it has to happen within you and that is what it is and if you are really seeking the truth as a reality then you must ask for that. Now the problem is when I talk about these things there has been some rude letters to me, you see there have been of course you have every right to be rude to me, it doesn't matter, because it is a personal right people here have rights for everything even if they don't pay for everything they can, it's not difficult for people to be rude in this country or any other country of this kind. Because we think that we can be rude to people despite the fact that they do not know a word about what I am talking, and they do not know what I am doing they have not seen my work and the work of the Kundalini without going into it, they are rude, alright they can be rude, but the question they ask, one of them asked me a question that we have heard it is very difficult to get your realisation. How can it be so spontaneous how can it be so, it is, you can see with your own eyes. All of them have, I can show you the rising of the Kundalini. You all can see yourself, I challenge you that way if you do

not believe me you can know now this is an escape, this is a typical escape of an ego oriented society. Because how can it be possible, it is not possible? But supposing it is there, very primitive though, it is a very primitive style it would be saying like how can you go on the moon you have to have been there, no it might be a photograph you are taking all the time doubting, but supposing it is, then the next question is why, how, maybe I am something maybe there is a definite something about me something special that's why it's happening. You had better find out or are you going to deny me only because you think it is not possible. This is your own idea, you haven't yet come inside, you have not seen it, you have not felt it you are denying it, how can it be possible, isn't it true? It happens that this is a typical ego oriented mind. When I came to London I met some disciples there who are still again here. In India they told me Mother you must go to the western people I said go ahead I will be very happy because I know you are all saints, you are seekers no doubt, but this ego orientation has given you another type of angularity which is a very difficult thing to explain. So I said go ahead definitely go ahead with it I don't mind so first time I had a program here we had about 300 people, second time we had a program we had 250, then we had 200, then we had 100, then we are having 50, so you see we are getting smaller and smaller on the other score which I never went into an Indian community say or Asians or anything, I said I will have nothing to do I will only work on foreigners to begin with. Very few here, I mean I call them foreigners because compared to Indians I am saying. So you will be amazed that in one shot I can see 250 people (?) they call me yesterday I went there (??) been 250, 80% got realisation, 80% got realisation, now my disciples have stopped saying that you must look after only the westerners here because you can always work on Indians in India. They have stopped saying that. I would love to do anything whatsoever work out for you, but what can you do about the Mr E G O ??? will tell you about it, she knows, you see it's such a tremendous colossal stuff, which all the time is giving you ideas which does not allow you to open yourselves to relax, after all what I am asking you?. What are you giving me? What am I asking you to surrender. Somebody asked me Mother after all, we have to surrender our ego. I said no no, I am not saying, don't surrender it, anything but, awaken your wisdom, can you do that? That's better, it's better to see if I say you have to surrender your ego then I have had it her even to say that you are egotistical itself is a terrible stuff and then to say that surrender your ego is even a worse thing. But after realisation you start seeing the colossal (????) it's all on my head now come along Mr Ego go down and you work it out. But still because this is what you have to do you are not to disturb this is for you. Thank God I do not take any money it's all free. That's why, because you cannot buy it, it is invaluable, it is the love of your Mother, try to understand try to understand, it is love, love of God which cannot be sold, you have to think with your heart, can you? Can you think with your heart? You have to feel with your heart, to get to Sahaja yoga, this is a very big problem but once you get your realisation it starts flowing gradually it starts coming down even those who are quite rude to me come back saying Mother it has started working in me it has come up, and I have felt the cool now I know what it is. The another method which can be employed is this the simple method is that you say that I can cure people, this I do, I can do, and you can cure people you can cure people ( the next part is largely inaudible) (now see Bala gave realisation to my husband? came here for the first time, he is a realised soul, anyone can see he is a realised soul, Bala should give him realisation?) what is this (??) who is standing here in Algeria, he has given realisation to 300 young people in Algeria, and most surprising the way we are ego oriented the same way we are very afraid of each other, very afraid of every person, very afraid of doing anything, look at him he just went out and said yes I have found the truth come along, now you come along, 500 people, engineers, doctors, all educated young people and he talked to them he told them now this is what I have found out, now see for yourself take it, but it is very difficult for people to speak up. Of course for politics they may stand on the box there on what do you call it Hyde Park and say something there, but for the truth, they are very slowed down afraid of (?) , this is another sign of being very afraid of each other , why? We are all tied by one thread, all of you all you are like little beads in the necklace of God you are all such beautiful things you have no idea only thing is you have not yet found the thread in which you are tied you are really very beautiful but this ego business is terrible that has made everyone so ugly. They just start shouting at everyone writing it off, what is there to shout. I went to (?) yesterday now for example I didn't have any disciples there, but they have heard about me, I cured only one man of his diabetes, just one man, but he was cured, just like a shock you see so he went and told that the Shakti has come, the Shakti like that and everyone believed him, when I

went there you would be surprised even the stationmaster who was an Indian, touched my feet he couldn't take my ticket, he touched my feet, that's finished, I went there, they had Aarti and everything, they did that way. They all got into realisation and everything there. When we were coming back we sat in a non smoking compartment with a tall and hefty handsome looking fellow sitting in a very good suit and everything and he started smoking so one of them said this is non smoking so he gave one abuse, a very nice one, a special one he must have learnt from somewhere I don't know where a very ?? type, and he said this door doesn't write that, so I can smoke and do what you like because it's paid for you see, but he never thought that even if it was non smoking or smoking he never thought that I might hurt somebody might or I myself am going to get cancer. (???) I mean it's a question of just understanding through your heart, but I would say any other person from a developing country thinks that. You would say please don't smoke. Oh I am sorry did I hurt you, I never knew don't smoke, (???) and he would get down at the other station and go to the other compartment, he would not, it is regarded as shameless, but it is regarded as vulgar, not only that it is regarded (the tape stops here)

[Part 11 Second tape]

The beginning is inaudible...............they just cannot think, they cannot imagine, they love their children and they can do anything for their children, and they go to any extent to such an extent that they can even now supposing the Queen has a son and he wants to have money she can even steal things from the treasury and give it to him herself. That is possible for an Indian Lady, she can do for her children, and family are most important, they can go to any extreme. It's left sided, it's too much involvement with the family, too much involvement, this is my child this is somebody else's child. All these things there, with that also you can get very much possessed, as you can get possessed by ego, and when you get possessed by that kind of idea there are some sort of spirits also can come into you and you can suffer from very bad possessions of the spirit. But the only advantage in such conditions is that we think speech can trouble you. Supposing a person does that, the police will catch hold of such a man and (put him in prison?) he may be a king (???) But for ego there is no dignity. You see unless and until you become violent nobody is going to catch hold of your ego, you can say whatever you like with your tongue, (???) and you be very rude to anyone, you have a right, it is I think ego is such a horrible thing that it gives you sin and you do not even feel this (breach). It makes you live within sin and you say what's wrong in it. Sharing sex point? What's wrong in it running away with another man giving up your responsibilities your children can stay behind, what's wrong because I am enjoying. It is very arbitrary it is malignant like one cell in the body says now my (???) What's wrong, I am going to grow so it grows like that you see, and the rest of the (???) What's wrong, because there is no co- operation for creation (???) Then what about the (???). It is very arbitrary (???) Do you understand that? It is a very serious thing. That a person can be like that, what's wrong, I am doing it, yes I like it, so I am doing it, I like it. You may but what about the whole being, you are a part and parcel of the whole, whole and you are just a little cell and only thing you can become the whole by understanding the will of the whole by becoming the will of the whole you become the whole ocean. The drop becomes the ocean. But we become small when we start thinking 'oh I can do whatever I like' and then when do we land in our own messes, these orphanages, ten old men in one orphanage, then ten old women in another orphanage, and ten young children in another orphanage, imagine, under the roof of God. These people become (???) Theres no heart for a Father who loves you and the Holy Ghost who is your Mother. It is absolutely self destroying and non loving. I mean it is hatred to everyone, you, I mean you don't know how stupid it is? We are so beautiful, God has created us with such care, you have no idea when you will see your chakras, you think how he has made us so beautiful when you think how he has made us so beautiful with different colours with different deities?. He has made the temple how he has made you a beautiful temple, can you see this here, all of you just see this is all of your makeup. See the chakras that he has made, how beautifully they are placed too. Through your evolution you have come up one by one, you are saved now, now why do you (???????????) And by that you may....................Why

you should be angry with yourself why should you pity yourself, I do not know how (?) and it is you only in the whole universe, in the whole creation in the whole play of God (???) You are going to be there not frogs and hanging (???) You are going to be saved. In the balance of beauty and dignity you have to enter the kingdom of God. So why hate yourself, I can't bear it, I can't bear my children hating themselves like this, why because you are limited because this nonsensical ego is overdeveloped, push it back, you are not your ego, you are the spirit, you are your love, open out, completely open out, there is no need to protect there is no need to have fear (???), are you getting the cool in your hands a little bit yes I can see it, put your hands (????) And feel very fine, Feel very relaxed, (?) here you have it, here automatically you have it.

The next piece is very poor sound

Now the third thing is one has to understand that after coming to Sahaja Yoga it happens to you no doubt, but we have problems, we have created problems (???) at every stage of our lives, we have wounded ourselves, at every stage as a child we have wounded ourselves, I mean you were wounded alright I would say you have to (???) You might not have done it to yourself, maybe your parents, maybe your society. There have been lots of boons, there have been lots of unhappiness in your life, alright. Then as you grew up in adolescent stage also you have been (???) And you had to be cheats, you had to be destructive, that had to be done. Then maybe in your seeking you have been much more wounded than anywhere else possibly, maybe because of the society you have lost the purpose of your life? It is very very (???) It might not happen, anything to do with (???) It makes no difference to me. You have come to me and that is my duty is to see that everything is (???) Same with your kundalini when she is awakened she at the first shock (???) Most of the people will just hit by the first shock, and they say Mother we felt very hyper, absolutely gone, we were lost they say, and then gradually you settled down and you started (???) Alright You see but you are to be cured. You are secure and some of them tried to be that, Mother we don't think we are excellent People. How do you know, this is another escape. Who is going to cleanse you, who is going to love you, who is going to look after you, who is going to do all that is necessary to put the kundalini up there(???) for your seeking. Some people will again

Go back to that scene, some people will be redeveloped so it is a very subtle thing in which you have to settle down, you have to settle down in such a manner that you are never removed from your seat. For that you have to a little bit see, you can, and patience, patience is the key word of Sahaja Yoga with you people. You must know, because you have reached stations, you haven't got patience with yourself and you have got so (unhappy) and most of them are like that I am so surprised. Like that Mother we feel so ashamed of ourselves, how can we be. Now what is this, who are you going to face. A child cannot face their own mother whom are you going to face just think of it why should you think that way ? It's too much. Are you afraid of me am I going to do you any harm to you in any way? Never. I know the mistakes have been done. You have all sinned but I have told you a hundred times, no sin is greater than my love, alright? Give me a chance, give me a chance to work it out and don't neglect yourselves because you are the people, you are the lights that were created and you are to be enlightened and you have to enlighten the whole world, we are standing at the precipice now from where it is possible that we will be destroyed. This is the joy...???....you are not content within yourself. That's what happens, it happens and when it happens it is (?) remarkable, you are getting the cool breeze in your hands, believe it, you see we start wondering how it is possible, how can it happen it is not possible, it cannot happen to me. It can happen, why not? What's wrong with you you cannot believe because it is too great, fantastic, but when we ask for it. Supposing you ask for the moon and the moon comes, then what do you say? Sound fades away....................hills and dales finding it, you don't know yourself (?), don't you know why you were born..................yesterday an Indian came and asked

me .................he said Mother..........about our past lives..............why do you want to weigh everything? Why you must know? ......because I feel like it now.........finished.....take it out......you must enjoy yourself after all, every Mother wants that her child must enjoy. She doesn't find out how much pain he is getting in the shocks, she doesn't find out, she just says alright I will cook for them they can come and enjoy themselves. She is just enjoying morning to evening, you must know your enjoyment is my enjoyment. let it happen now. God wants you to enjoy yourself he doesn't want you to kill yourself morning to evening sapping yourself morning till evening, taking

yourself how can you? You are parents you have father and mother. Do you think as parents you would like your child to be hitting himself morning to evening. Here He has made all this beautiful world, and he wants you to enjoy. He wants you to see how beautiful he has made for you, how comfortable, how blissful is the reality that God has spread for you. And he wants to see his children prospering and enjoying and witnessing the great play of his creation, this is what it is. He has really he has worked very hard and now this is at the finishing point we should not disappoint him because of certain foolish ideas you have got somewhere, it's very childish, I think it is very childish, you should be childlike but not childish that's OK I do not say, I never get angry with anyone, those who even shout at me, I know, because you are children, (you can say anything. It makes no difference to me?), don't waste your time, you have to grow you have to mature, you have to enjoy the fruit of your seeking. Look at our (??) he is a little boy, very mature, he could be all your great grandfather the way he's knowledge, absolutely complete so that's what it is, a little child could be you all could be like that, (?) absolutely like that one, no questions, no doubt, nothing, just there enjoying yourself just asking me telling you where is the matter, where is the problems, what is happening, finished. Any questions (??) what is it, any questions. Today is a small group in a way. (????????) Why don't you sit down (????) Come along here (?????) (Inaudible question from member of the audience) sounds like "You cannot help us because you don't know how to go about it............"

SM I agree with you, you cannot grow up, very true, you cannot grow up, but there is something you see I would say, that there is an unconscious within us which works you see and if you say come to the median path then it won't be a problem, just you have to keep yourselves as you are, say for example, now this candle is here has to be enlightened, it cannot enlighten by itself that's the point if we cannot know how to go about it. Alright,but some light which is enlightened can enlighten another. But if this channel is broken. It has finished itself off, It is an extreme it has gone this way that way you see, then it is difficult, isn't it? Still we can put it right it is not difficult, it is not difficult to put it right. Ideally you don't know how to go about it, and that's absolute truth and that's the greatest thing to say is that we do not know how to go about it. So let it be, it doesn't matter it will work out but with wisdom with understanding you will know that somebody has to do it, somebody has to do it, who is real who is unreal cannot do it. Now how do you make out the real and an unreal, because we are so insensitive that we are more attracted by the unreal than by the real. Really if you had not done that we would not have crucified Christ you would not have given poison to Mohammed sahib. So how to make out a real and unreal is the problem, is that we have to consider the scriptures now the scriptures have said it they have prophesied all the scriptures have prophesied that you will be entering into the kingdom of God. Every scripture has said and that prophesy has to come true, alright? Then what is the way to make out the real person the first and foremost thing, for a gross personality. Such a person is not interested in your purse, neither in your position, neither in your race in your creed, neither as to how you are dressed or how you approach. Maybe some people I have seen they do not know how to come to a Holy person, they think they can sit like this, also some times they sit like this, they sit like this, they can sit any way they like, they are not going to harm you, they do not look at you, makes no difference, makes no difference, that is one thing that one should know such a person does not bother about these things, he's only interested in your well being like the other day one lady said that, I would not take that horrible fellows name, but that yogi is a very charming man, really, what charms does he do for you, your health is down absolutely, you have got a bad liver, you are looking so very pale you are so horrid, and he's not bothered about your health, nothing of the kind. And how do you say that he's charming and by his charms how do you, what do you gain, so that is false, that outer appearance and outer behaviour is not the point, but the inner concern of a person is it, what he is concerned about what is he talking about, second is he talking what the scriptures have told you, first thing holy, righteous, person, generosity, all the Ten Commandments, that are written in the scriptures. Does he himself follow or not? Because Some of them have 5, 6 (???) there very nicely they have also got airstrips, at your money they have got all kinds of things. Such people if they call themselves you will know that they are, this is the minimum but the real test of a real guru is I wish I had brought some(?????) a book written by Adi Shankaracharya, but if he is a real guru he awakens this power in you. He must give you your own power, what is it. I have thousands of powers though what is it to you, say supposing this light is burning very nicely, alright, what is it to this light which is not burning, if it can burn this a little bit also then we can say it has some light in

it. So if he doesn't give you your power it is useless he cannot give you. He would be interested that you should get your power, and if you get your power which is also described in all the books, is the power of Chaitanya, is the divine vibrations. Christ also has said something passed from my body when somebody touched me. It should be like that, if you get that power of understanding of the Kundalini and understanding of others then you should say that that is a guru. This is the minimum that he should awaken your kundalini. Now we have one guru Guru Maharaj he is a very nice person he knows about me (????)What I am and he never saw me, but he talked about me and he is the man who has given realisation to only one, and now he is sitting down there, he doesn't want to come back , he has told me they have all kinds of diseases, no I don't want ???? No, No no Do whatever, I will hit them (?). I said why are you so angry with them, because they take time to get their realisation, they are not Mataji. So they take time, poor things, you know he looked after one single soul for 25 years one single soul, and now he gave him realisation no doubt, and he put him on the path to a (higher?) position, he thought he had cleansed him and all that then he said now you go in the world and preach so the preacher came in him, but still he was not yet to be done in twenty five years time, he had started smoking, then he took to women then he took to money. In Sanskrit it is saying (???) And cunning, (????) means gold and (???) is a woman??? So When I talked to him I said what has become of ??? He told me Mother he said let him go to hell. (???) Don't take his name before me Mataji, it doesn't behave your tongue to take this fellowsname, I said what happened............................(?)

Inaudible.............denounce him, he said you had better not see him at all his black face, you don't see a black face like that, he was very angry. But one day you see this Guru Maharaj In Bombay came to a disciple of mine and she wrote me Mother he is coming to see me. (???) I said I must see him now (????) So I went to see this one single soul who in 25 years (?????) This guru has given realisation and now he is sitting down. I went and saw this(???), very nicely he was sitting there (???) he knows me who I am, so he touched my feet, alright and he sat down. Argh he said you went to (???), he said you went to meet my Guru, I am very angry with my Guru, I said what's wrong with your Guru, this is never said for a guru that I am angry with my guru. You would never say like that, it is too arrogant to say about your Guru, I said why, is he coming now to Bombay he said I am come to Bombay to meet Mataji. Why should he come, why should she come from the (???) I said why you are threatened you are threatened about it. You see when he came to Bombay he found out about this fellow what he was doing there so he was very angry with the guru, you see that his guru was finding out everything, he said I think it had better stay there and then I saw, found his Agnya chakra completely caught up, absolutely, now he is alright. Realisation also is going down. Then what happened I told him I said I am going now but I told him I am going just now but I will give you a deeper. Still it's up to you, I will put my finger on your forehead and I will go so I put some kumkum and put it on his forehead and then I said now you put some kumkum on mine. As soon as he put onto my Agnya I sucked it in he said what are you doing and he chuck chuck chuck, like that he started shaking he said what are you doing, are you going to break my finger or what? What are you doing? I must say (Shri Mataji says Something in Sanskrit or Marathi) argh Better? (?) are you better? and you will be surprised, then I told him this is what has happened to your Agnya. I won't leave until you promise not to say a word against your guru and you give up all this nonsense, so this is what he (did?). But there is something about Sahaja Yoga that it works so spontaneously so you don't want to have to worry you get your realisation, and then I will tell you all the decoding and everything 100% completely, alright and that absolutely free (?)

Shri Mataji: Speaks to someone in audience You, how are you? Shri Mataji: Good
Inaudible question from audience.....about giving money Shri Mataji: yes, you see...that's why

Yogi: Yes but what has it got to do with here and now?

Audience member: What?
Yogi: What has it got to do with here and now? Why are you bringing the subject up now?

Shri Mataji: Alright, correct, Gavin it's a waste of time I tell you. You see if you think that money giving is a symbolic thing it is not. It is more ego satisfaction because you have brought the point up. We think we can purchase even God but we cannot, and they are paying all this you see, you feel satisfied, you have paid for it, it is a kind of ego satisfaction, you have paid for God, it is not that simple my child, the symbol of love is much deeper. With money you cannot solve, that is what you are doing with your children also you give your children very expensive toys to play with, but not your heart, your heart should feel if you have any symbol thats your heart you feel, not the money by money you make it very gross, What he is saying is this, you see that at this time you will see people's attention will go away, they are concentrated now, that's why he doesn't want to disturb us, But that is very perfect that money orientation itself is a wrong thing. Money has got all these problems, women here think of money, men think of money, that's why you have problems in the first place, you should forget about money for a short time, at least with me it will be a good idea.

If you bring that money over here then You are going to spoil the whole thing because it is very insulting, very insulting, you cannot purchase the love of your Mother with money, you know Christ was sold for 30 rupees you know that, are you going to purchase me also and then sell me on? It can be very (??) People do such crimes for money. That is one of the very subtle possessions of human beings believe me once I say that alright if you give me money I will take the money. Immediately your ego will be satisfied, I cannot give you realisation not by satisfying your ego, but your wisdom only I can give you realisation, by satisfying your heart only I can give you realisation. You people have so much money here much more than Indians have but there is no satisfaction in that. That's why money is not a good thing, anybody who takes somebody's money I will tell you one thing you take just a juxtaposition separate.

If I give you some money, say I tell you I will give you £5, will you take it, for a month, will you take it any one of you? Free, will you take it. Anyone of you who is agreeable to take £5 from me, free With the knowledge of everybody else? Raise your hands. Then why should I? why would you not take because it's your self respect that you do not do it, only the parasite will act, only the beggars will act, you make a person a beggar. By giving money to that person and your ego is satisfied, I am not a beggar, I am a Queen, will you go and give some money to your Queen, let me see who is going to do that. Do you give any money to your Queen, but to her also if you have to give you will have to give big diamonds, you have to give your heart, heart, this is a very wrong idea that it is what it is here. it is very low, it's something very very low you people do not understand. It is subtlety working out in this money oriented society. For example, Father and Mother once you are 18 years you are on the dole, finished, a selfish parasite. This is a parasitic habit Itself that young people should take a dole why should you take a dole alright, then you leave your parents, you just send them Happy Xmas an expensive card which you send, which is greater. Finished, when the father dies there is nobody next to the father to look after him.

Look at this man who is sitting here, he has an old father he lives with, his brother is looking after him, his brother is living with him, his grandfather will be living with him, his great grandfather will be living with him that is his responsibilities in old age. These children will be living with you (??). Here you people think they are cheap they give them toys , very expensive, we don't give our children, we don't spoilt them, whatever they want they give them, we do not do that, of course we give them sufficient but we do not spoil them, whatever we can afford we give them. But what we give them is complete love and complete dedication and complete service and complete oneness. They have every right on you for example my keys can be handled by my grandchildren or by my children, no problem, they can take away whatever they like, they can do, whatever sari they want they can wear, if they want to, (???) they have a right and they do it, and very happy to do it, but this society is so money oriented just like ego that you cannot see something beyond money that's

the point, like you see my children and my grandchildren are coming so my husband says (something about shops?) I said what? I am so overjoyed because the house will be spoilt, it is very beautifully done. Just look at that, for us our grandchildren are coming so morning to evening we are thinking Oh God what we are going to have, and they are also thinking that we are going to see our grandparents what are we to do, nothing, just meeting each other.

Here nobody meets you know, when they meet they do not talk, they will have I have seen even children they will buy those comics and all will be reading together, and they are spending the day together and they want to go to see a picture. When we want to meet someone we must have 2 or 3 hours free let us talk, nicely now let us talk and we have rapport, share, we think by giving money we reciprocate care. Even a small thing which you think is something special it is so joy giving it is so (???)

We have a story about Rama once when he went into exile he was passing through a forest and there was an old lady and she was belonging to the aboriginal class, absolutely old and she heard that Rama was coming that time the people were much more sensitive much much more sensitive than they are today because they were not so much materialistic you see. (???) And she was so happy she went round telling all over and she told to all the (?) and she told to all the seekers, and all of them, and all the flowers she told them to be happy Shri Rama is coming, and she started thinking what should I give to my ?. What can I give to my King? She wanted to give him something to keep, to solve where to get that beautiful thing that I can give to Rama. So in those days there was this berry we call as ??? That is a different type, you don't get here. They were, they were the fruits were available at that time, so she went and plucked all them and then she sat down and ate, tasted them, by putting her teeth very slowly into them............
