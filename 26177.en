Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Palacio Bencich, Buenos Aires (Argentina)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

Shri Mataji: I never expected so many Sahaj Yogis to be there at the airport to welcome me. Some of you I have not even met and not even see you and I felt very happy to see you all. Specially yesterday when we began was tremendous we had so many people and all of them got realisation

Shri Mataji: That shows that in this country we have a great potential. And that if you really, properly have this Sahaja Yoga, we can have many many, many, many more Sahaj yogis. First of all, one has to know that we have to be extremely kind and gentle with the new Sahaja Yogis. They will see you and form their ideas about Sahaja Yoga. I have seen many a times new Sahaja Yoga come and just disappear because people don’t handle them with care. Now we are sort of a stage, in a building stage here and we have to be really very careful that you are the foundation and that you have to bear the whole load upon yourself.

Shri Mataji: I also heard that there are many girls and boys who want to get married. That is a very good idea. But first of all who have married, who have come all the way, should give certificate that the people are all right.

Shri Mataji: Actually the Spanish girls have very bad reputation. That they are extremely dominating and they don’t understand what they have got in Sahaj Yoga. They are very ordinary looking, ordinarily educated and they think that they are the Queens of Spain. So I asked the leader of Spain, “What’s the matter with these women here? Why do they behave like that?” Because Sahaja Yogis leaders have told me, “Mother, don’t marry these Spanish girls they are horrible, they can’t be quiet nice” So I asked the leader and he said that Mother, nowadays they are trying to become Matadors to fight the bull.   They are no more women but have become more than men.   I have to send back so many women I must stay to their countries.   And now they are black listed they are not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.    Because nobody has business to make anybody miserable.   If you think too much of yourself, you should not marry.   And bring bad name to Sahaja Yoga.   It’s very dangerous to do like that.   And it can end up into anything.   So to be a good housewife is very important for a Sahaja Yogini.   I am myself a woman and I am surprised how the women in Sahaja Yoga are not upto the point.   I have given many lectures about it.   That you are a woman, you are the pillar of the society of Sahaja Yogis.   You must respect your husband otherwise nobody will respect you.   And your children won’t respect you either.   So all these kind of stupidity will just take back the Spanish women. My lecture has worked no doubt. And they are much better.  They are good wives and very good mothers.  But one of the reason I think in Spain, Sahaj Yoga doesn’t spread because the women as they are, they were.   When I go to Spain lots of people come in but they drop out.   Because the Sahaja Yogi must give pure love to them.   I am sure we had so many people yesterday, they will all come and they would like to go.   They might be in great number.   But when they start seeing Sahaja Yogis how they gave, how they talk together, all these things work on their mind.   So these kindness and this compassion and this love is to be absolutely fully expressed in Sahaja Yoga.   So that others who come see this and they feel happy about it.   There’s nothing to learn from American women.   They are really mad.   They have ruined their lives.   They have ruined their children, their families by fighting with each other.   Our Sahaja culture is different.   We believe in having beautiful families.   And also we believe that we should have such beautiful relationship of husbands and wife that the saints want to take birth, to be born in our families.    You must understand that you are not like ordinary men or women.   You are special   Selected because of your speciality. Because you are seeking.   So now when the new people are coming, please be very careful.   So that others see and feel enamoured by Sahaja Yoga.   And I am sorry I am saying this because I have seen many a times, people coming in thousands to my lecture and afterwards there are hardly very few.   After all we are all Sahaja Yogis.   You are my children.   Understand your importance is the only thing that you have to do.   You cannot be cheap you cannot be cheap and frivolous.   But I have seen now in Argentina people are doing very well and working out everything.   Everything was so first class. I enjoyed my stay thoroughly.   I thank you very much really for looking after every arrangement so beautifully, so capably.   In the same way you have to look after the new people who are coming, with love and respect.   Don’t have any trouble there, just enjoy their company.    Anything you need, anything you want, anything that troubles you, you can always write to me.   I am your Own, you can always call Me.   Now we have brought some presents, some very few for the ladies only because we didn’t know what to get for men. (Spanish interpretation) Thank you very much!

Shri Mataji: Now the list of ladies.

Shri Mataji conversing with local coordinator and Indian Sahaja Yogi.

Shri Mataji looking at the statue: Very good I must say. Done very well. They are all artist (Spanish interpretation) .[36:05] May God Bless you.

Shri Mataji: Honeycomb

Laughter all around.

Shri Mataji: Thank you!

Shri Mataji receives one more fur cloth piece and looks at it turning around: Thank you very much! Thank you, Aasan.. In Sanskrit we call Aasan. We use for seat. 

Sahaja Yogi translates for all in Spanish about meaning of Aasan.   

Another Sahaja Yogi opens a present of a delicate thread work table cloth at the Lotus feet of Shri Mataji. 

Shri Mataji looks forward and bends and picks it with admiration

Shri Mataji: Ooh!

Sahaja Yogi : Her grandmother made it

Shri Mataji while looking at it all around and the details of hand work: Very pretty. Thank you very much. Thank you. One more Sahaja Yogi comes forward and gives a shawl.   

Sahaja Yogi: She made it

Shri Mataji smells the cloth and ask the coordinator to smell it as well.   Shri Mataji sees the cloth all around and over.  

Shri Mataji: She didn’t put any scent? It has good smell. (Spanish interpretation)

Local Sahaja Yogi: It’s a table cloth....[39:26]

Sahaja Yogi in Hindi: It’s the body perfume.

Sahaja Yogis start singing songs for Shri Mataji in Spanish.   Shri Mataji claps at the end of the song with all other Sahaja Yogis. 

Shri Mataji: I  am thinking of having a group of Sahaja Yogis from a kind of a (asking in Marathi to an Indian Sahaja Yogi, what is called?) troupe on the stage.

Local Sahaja Yogi: In America?

Shri Mataji nods Her Head: In America

Sahaja Yogi: He is coming to America in January with entire choir

Sahaja Yogi after completing the Spanish song: One song in English

Shri Mataji nods her Head in approval.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji I can, Shri Mataji (laughter all around), I will first say the words of this song and then sing. The song says, “There is something, I want to say and I hope that you can feel it. There is a Universe within lying in every human being just waiting to arise.   If you are searching Eternity and you want to get it in reality, then you are a special man who has come on the right time to be born again.  There is a birth of evolution. And today is the day of revolution. The revolution from inside and all the mysteries of life today you reveal. 

And then he says, you may ask me How this is possible? You may ask me why today? this is Heaven on Earth, you will feel it for yourself.

Then the songs start with Shri Mataji listening to it with concentration. 

Singer starts singing:

“There is something, I want to say and I hope that you can feel it.

There is a Universe within lying in every human being just waiting to arise.

If you are searching Eternity and you want to get it in reality

Then you are a special man who has come on the right time to be born again.

There is a birth of evolution. And today is the day of revolution.

Revolution from inside and all the mysteries of life today you reveal.

(You may ask me how this is possible? You may ask me why today? This is the Heaven on Earth, you will feel it for yourself).X 2
