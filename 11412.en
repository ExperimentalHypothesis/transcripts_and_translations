You have so many now Sahaja Yogis, ah?

(The interpreter, “Yes, Shri Mataji. They are all Sahaja Yogis”)

So many!

(The interpreter, “Yes, Shri Mataji”.)

I’m amazed to see so many Sahaja Yogis in Ukraine. That shows how people are sensitive to spirituality, that they are taking to it so easily. They have been waiting I think, seeking all these years and suddenly now they have found the way. I see your love and your compassionment, your sweetness. I just don’t know how to put it in words – what I feel.

Tonight for the Program I hope you’ll be all there and I’ll tell you how to be with yourself and how to be with everybody else. We have to bring peace to this world. And you people can do it. And the way it is spreading here it has to spread all over the world. There are some very nice girls married from here – from Kyiv. And they have a very-very good reports about them. Also about the men who were married. They say that they are very deep, very great Sahaja Yogis. Specially in America they are very much adored (Shri Mataji laughs). And they can’t understand how Russians have been so great in spirituality. Spec(ially) about the Ukraine people also when I’ll tell them they’ll be amazed. They ask Me, “Why Russia and Ukraine, why?” I don’t know what to answer. You’ll have to tell Me the answer (Shri Mataji laughs).

I thank you to come all the way to this airport to welcome Me. My heart is filled with tremendous happiness. You can understand what a mother feels when she meets her children after such a long time. So I hope you all will come now to the Program and we have to expand Sahaja Yoga to give love, wisdom and joy to others. Thank you.

(Shri Mataji is talking in Hindi with two Indians who are living in Ukraine).

Say that you must take for a longer period in this country so that the problems of the Ukraine people will be solved. Please say it.

Indians are saying that, “You should stay here for a longer period.” They are all requesting Me I should stay here for a longer period to solve the problem of the people. Indians report there are problems.
