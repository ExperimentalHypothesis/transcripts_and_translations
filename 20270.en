This is a very...I should say, whatIt is very symbolic song, written by (Amit Cuso?), which I heard (read) it a longe time back.And it is very beautiful, and it says that:I have lost myself, by just looking at you.And it is very beautiful song, And it is a song, Which is being sung for years together.But people don ÃÅt understand the meaning.It looks romantic, but it means the, what should we say, the sufi style of saying things, the way they love God and that they love devinity.Very beautiful.
