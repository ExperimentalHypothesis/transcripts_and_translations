“(...) Even by blindly accepting it you have not been able to solve your problems. We  have to pay attention to this question, there must be some meaning in us and there must be some arrangement within us to manifest that meaning. It is very easy to deny and defy everything intellectually and intelligence gives you the capacity to cheat yourself all the time. Not only that;  it gives you the capacity to avoid facing the Truth. It can provide any argument – which may be absurd as you will see later on – to convince you that reality is  what you see with your gross attention.

But pure intelligence sees the game this intellect is playing and knows how limited the function of rationality is.

The functions I am talking to you about are unlimited ..

I am going to put forward a hypothesis. Like good scientists, as intelligent people you must keep your mind open and try to absorb it. If it is proved, then you have to accept it.

Therein lies the real bravery of intellect. If intellect teaches you cowardice it is not intellect.

My hypothesis concerns what exists within us and resides in us as our subtle being.

First of all we have to understand that we are made in a similar way to a spacecraft. You can also see how a seed sprouts: a tree comes, step by step,  from one single seed. A spacecraft is not a living process, but it gives you some idea as to how this living process of evolution takes place.

There are containers in the spacecraft. In the same way, we have got physical, emotional, mental and spiritual containers placed inside of us. When the spacecraft blasts off, its outer shell has all the other containers inside it and when it reaches a certain height, a certain velocity,  an explosion is triggered so that it can travel at a much higher speed.

Similarly,  when an explosion in our physical being is triggered within us our evolutionary process is accelerated. Next, an explosion is triggered in our emotional being, then in our mental being and finally in our spiritual being .

The spiritual being within you is placed in the sacrum bone, in your triangular bone. The Greeks called it ‘sacrum’ because it is a sacred bone and if the human body burns this bone does not get burnt. These ideas must have come to them from the unconscious. When this spiritual being within you is placed in the sacrum bone you are a human being and your awareness is at human level.

When the final blast takes place within you, you jump into the realm of the subtle, all-pervading Divine Power which all the great saints and all the great incarnations have spoken of. When you jump into that awareness your attention becomes one with space.

You know that Newton's law does not apply in space because there you reach an absolute state. In the same way  this Kundalini rises and travels all the way to this position called  the fontanelle bone area -‘Talu’ in Sanskrit– which was very soft when you were a child. When the Kundalini pierces  this area you get your baptism and you become one with the all-pervading Power. Your attention becomes enlightened. This is what enlightenment means.

If  I say that there are  lots of pictures and beautiful scenes over here, you will not believe it. But if you bring a good television set and put it to the mains you will start seeing them. In the same way you have to be connected with the mains. We are not yet connected with the mains and that’s why we live in a world of relativity. All our political,  economic and other enterprises are merely relative.

For example here, we have the power of desiring on one side and on the other side is the power of creating, creativity. These powers are manifested outside  as left and right sympathetic nervous systems. The central power of evolution is the parasympathetic nervous system. For our day to day work we use the energy from the  sympathetic systems  on both  sides, either from the left or from the right. As a by-product of these  activities we develop the Ego on the right sympathetic or the Superego on the left.

When both  the Ego and Superego  meet on the head and they are calcified you manifest your ‘I-ness’. So you become Mr X, Mr Y, Mr Z. You feel your independence and freedom. This freedom is given to you because you have to be free to seek the balance between life and death, good and bad, righteous and unrighteous, holy and unholy .

Mistakes do not matter, we actually learn from our errors, but this freedom is given to you because you have to become the citizens of God’s kingdom, which is absolute freedom. When you become one of His citizens then you really become  the master of yourself. Nobody needs to tell you  “Do this.” or “Do that.” You don’t need any correction.

On the whole we can say that those people who use mainly the left-hand side  form very orthodox religions and use their emotions to produce works such as melodramatic poems and poetry .  By doing this you live in your past, in your subconscious.

Once you have repudiated all that, you start  accepting science as the only means of achievement and you come onto the right-hand side. You start creating, or rather you feel you are creating even though you don’t create anything. You do not create, that is a false notion that human beings have, because in fact you only transform something that is already dead into another dead thing. We cannot even sprout one single seed. We cannot even make one flower into a fruit – not a single one!

With all our scientific development we have not been able to do anything like that. Through science you only discover what exists, but you cannot say  why it exists. For example you cannot say why there is magnetism in Mother Earth. Medical science cannot explain many things either. It is the nature of the body to repel everything that is foreign but when a child is conceived in the body, not only is it retained, but it is also nurtured and looked after and repelled at the right time.  Another example is adrenaline and acetylcholine, which are two chemicals. The way they act in the human body depends on which sympathetic nervous system they are in: they may increase, they may contract or they may relax.

Thus we can see there are a thousand and one things we cannot explain, we do not know how they work.

Jung, who in My view was a great psychologist, tried to experiment with people’s dreams . He reached the conclusion that there are some universal symbols which appear in dreams that are suggestions for our guidance or for our correction, coming from somewhere which he called the unconscious. Jung just gave this the name,  “unconscious”,whereas a doctor named  this field of medicine the “autonomous nervous system”. But we should ask ourselves “Who is this Auto?”

For example if you run fast then the sympathetic nervous system can increase the rate of your heartbeats but it is the parasympathetic in the centre that calms it down and brings it back to normal . This is done effortlessly.

Now, I say there is a power within us which is our germinating power, just waiting to give us our second birth that we call Sahaja  Yoga, which means  ‘spontaneous union with the Divine’. You cannot pay for this happening, this baptism. You cannot have it done by anyone from a theological college . All this decorum and all these decorations are of no use to this Kundalini. There is no need for you to stand on your heads or do any such tricks ,she won’t rise. She understands everything. She won’t rise for a person who is unholy and taking money to raise  the Kundalini. God does not understand money at all. He will have to come to Switzerland to learn banking.

One thing you must know is that this is a spontaneous happening within us and the energy which is put there by God Almighty  is going to work it out  by itself. It has been described very clearly in various scriptures. In the Bible it is written : “I will appear before you like tongues of flames”. All the petals from these centres which are very subtle look like tongues of flames when you see them. But when people start living with dead shells and organizing them, the whole essence of  religion is itself absolutely dead.

All the religions in the world are flowers on the great tree of life. They are nurtured by the same Shakti, by the same Power. But we remove these flowers, call them our own, organize them and after a few days they die . Quarrels about religion are also very detrimental to our spiritual growth. God is going to look after our spiritual growth and that is why He has placed  all these centres within us which have gross manifestations as plexuses.

There are seven of these basic centres in us, plus two  – nine in all . These centres are related to our emotional, physical beings and so on. They are the milestones of our evolution.

Now the first centre is the basis that we have, matter, Mother Earth itself, the carbon atom in us.

The second centre with six petals goes round and round this area called the void and in this way it creates the Sun. This nourishes our attention. It also transforms the fat cells for  the brain to use when we think too much. By  thinking too much we do not allow this centre to do the other work it has to do, which is to look after the liver, the kidneys, the pancreas, the spleen and other important organs of the viscera. In the West, the action or movement on this centre is so intense that people cannot stop thinking. Yesterday in Lausanne, there was a doctor who was looking very miserable. He came to Me after the  programme and said : “You can cut my throat, you can take out my brain, but it is impossible for me to stop thinking.”

This is the left and the right sympathetic and in the centre  is the parasympathetic. When we start using too much energy from our left or right sympathetic nervous systems we get disconnected from the centre . So when the right sympathetic starts working on its own it has no connection with the whole and you cannot control your thinking.  Any cell that is disconnected because it is affected by irritation or excitement  becomes malignant. It is on its own.

Moreover, in  ego-oriented societies we believe there is nothing wrong with getting out of the whole because we are already having an ego trip on our own. That is the reason why in  affluent societies today families are breaking up and people are planning only one thing : how to commit suicide. It is shocking, but in London I saw seventeen-year-old Swedish girls  who were giving vibrations as if they were zombies.  I took them home with Me and was very sweet to them. When I asked them what they were thinking of all the time they said they were thinking about how to commit suicide, making plans. They were seventeen years old, just think of it ! They should have been blooming, cheerful,  chirping like birds !

I’m told Switzerland is also following Sweden’s example or has already outdone them in this. You are so blessed by God, you have such a beautiful country, He has been so bountiful ! Instead of feeling grateful and expressing gratitude for that bounty why are you committing suicide? You are very free compared to thousands of people in the world who are not even free to talk. Judging by all the norms of development you should be the happiest people living and yet I see a state of confusion everywhere and start wondering what sort of development you are going to bestow upon poor countries like India. Are you also going to give us a plan for how to commit suicide?

We must understand we have made a mistake, we have gone too far to the right by thinking and planning for the future. The future does not exist , it is imaginary. Some people have gone too far to the left, towards romanticism, artificiality and committing suicide. Go too far in either direction and you end up committing suicide.

You have to stay in the centre, in the present. But this cannot be done by brainwashing. Your attention is so often outside that something has to happen to attract it inside.

That is why a happening is organized in your inner being. Without this happening your attention cannot be drawn in. It’s like a spring that rises and suddenly your attention is attracted inside.

For this enlightenment to happen you must know that whatever you have achieved so far as a human being was not done in your awareness. For the  first time in your human awareness you are going to see your evolution taking place. This is an actualisation, it has to happen to you. If it has not happened yet, no use paying money for it , no use doing anything . Some people are paying lots of money to fly in the air. Why ? Do you want to become birds, then frogs and then amoeba?

These are unnatural processes which could  take you into the collective subconscious or the collective supraconscious and you might end up becoming a demon. I’ve seen people doing all such kinds of  activities who end up with epilepsy , cancer and all kinds of incurable diseases, let alone bankruptcy. And then I’m supposed to cure all these ills, including bankruptcy ! This actualisation takes place within us.

As you have got pamphlets now you can take them home and read all about it but you must make sure that you get it. If you do not get it, that does not mean that I am wrong, because  thousands of people have already got it from Me and not only from Me. Many of My disciples, like Me, have cured cancer . They have become beautiful people now and they have become their own masters , they are no longer enslaved by greed and lust. They have become peaceful and they have understood the meaning of their life.

When you plug  this microphone into the mains it understands what it is meant to do and starts emitting My voice. When you switch on a light it understands  that it is meant to enlighten others and give enlightenment. Somebody asked Me  “Now that I’m enlightened, Mother, what should I do?”  I said : “ You give light . What else should you do now?” So we have to remember that only an enlightened light can enlighten another light.

If I am an enlightened light then I can enlighten your light and you can enlighten another one. You just act as a catalytic agent. Why should your  ego be challenged by this ? Because I am doing it? Could you have done it? I wish you could take My place. Last night I could not sleep till three o’clock because I was working on difficult people. I go to  Indian villages and live in  conditions that you cannot bear to live in because  the essence of real seekers lies in these simple people. But complicated people can take Me hours of hard work. When you get enlightened you can also give enlightenment. Now there are thousands of Sahaja Yogis  in the West too. In India we have many more. All their patience put together is nothing compared to mine because I see the beauty in you much more clearly.

I see the diamond that is the Spirit in your heart sparkling and I see how precious you are. I don’t see anything else, while they see other things. They  get tired and fed up, they  don’t  want to argue with any intellectuals. Grégoire was a big intellectual. His brain was developing like horns on both sides. It took Me a long time to give him Realization. He was very argumentative, over-read, he had read all sorts of books, it was like being in a library, but he got his Realization because he is a seeker and he is an ardent, honest seeker. If you have self-esteem you will know that  the Spirit is within you and you will cooperate with Me.

That is how you become meaningful. You don’t have to pay  Me or be grateful to Me at all because this is My nature and My job, I’m  just doing My job. I cannot rest without giving you love . My nature is to give. Why should you feel hurt about it? I cannot understand human beings : if you give them  even tuppence-worth of things they feel so grateful , but if you say you want to give them  the absolute that is within you they’ll jump on you like a tiger.

Egoistic behaviour is very interesting. When you  get your Realization and see how people behave you will have a lot to laugh about.  Sahaja Yogis are all the time laughing at  the stupidity with which people indulge their Ego. You have been given this intellect  to make you understand that to go beyond you have to give up limited rationality. However, that does not mean that you should become irrational.

Supposing you come to this hall by car, you leave your car outside before entering the hall. That is pure rationality. But if you are so identified with your car that  you bring it inside, what is that? Once you have received your Realization then you will go back to your car in an enlightened manner and understand that rationality is all-pervading.

Now, when the Kundalini rises above this point you become thoughtlessly aware, your awareness is enlightened. In Sanskrit that is called ‘Nirvichara Samadhi’. ‘Dhi’ means  awareness and “sama” means enlightened: ‘Samadhi’ is enlightened awareness.

When this happens you rise to a new state of consciousness, you become collectively conscious. The U.N. and all these other organizations say  “We are all one. We are brothers and sisters.”  but nothing happens inside of us, whereas when you actually become collectively conscious, you start feeling the collective around you. On the chart you see that all the centres are shown in different colours and here are the same centres  which are enlightened on the fingers. For example this one is the centre for your heart. The left side represents the emotional side and the right side your physical and  mental side.

The discovery is fantastic because your machinery is so fantastic and starts working out its miracle.

There was one gentleman who got his Realization and when I told him that he could feel his father, mother and anybody else on his hands  he could not believe it. Suddenly one day he told Me : “Mother, I’m getting a burning sensation here”. I told him  “The right side is your father’s, all these centres are your father’s and the finger that is burning is this centre, the Vishuddhi. Find out what’s the matter with him, he must have some throat trouble or bronchitis.” His father was in Scotland so he telephoned and his mother told him that his father had gone down with very bad bronchitis. Sitting down in London we knew exactly what was happening to Nixon.

There is tremendous communication in this all-pervading Power. If, like a computer, you get connected with the Divine you can ask any question, such as “Does God exist ?” By asking such an absolute question immediately  you get tremendous vibrations flowing in your hands. If you ask whether a false guru is true or not, you will be amazed, there will be no vibrations, they will stop. That means your instrument becomes so sensitive that you can feel where the problem is in your own centres  and you also start feeling other people’s centres .

Instantaneously, Self-Realization also means the Realization of the whole. But there are different levels of  Realization . For example in places  like Nepal or India, where people are not yet so dependent on their intellect , where they are not yet so developed, they jump directly into the realm of doubtless awareness.

In that awareness you just feel the joy of being. In the West , because of the many ramblings of your intellect you go around finding out whether it is true or not, verifying whether what Mataji  said is correct or not, decoding everything and catching from other people. Then again you come to Me for correction.

My husband once said  “When you have already given them Realization every day why do you have to work on them again and again?” At that time I had a disciple from Paris and as My husband deals with shipping she told him  “Sir, there are some ships which are second-hand and they have to be repaired from time to time.” So they can only reach the stage of doubtless awareness that is a state of mind  by understanding in a circuitous way. They don’t want to do it like this : they go round and round and then come back.

Even if you are developed, still you can see the Kundalini rising , you see the pulsation in the triangular bone. You can see the pulsation with your naked eye. With a stethoscope you can see the pulsation just like a heartbeat going up to that point and you can see it opening this centre because the fontanel bone  becomes soft. You see it with your naked eye but still you go on doubting, you still start analysing. It ‘s as if  I  give you a nice cake to eat and you just sit down with your analysis. It’s so absurd, as if an egg has to go to the library to find out how to fly or how to become a bird !

We had a great poet, Kabir, who said “Padi, Padi pandit murakh bahe”, which means “By reading these great educated people have become stupid.” He was very outspoken. He also said that if you can go to God by shaving your head or wearing your crown, what about the sheep that is sheared twice a year?  He said such beautiful things . After Realization you start understanding great poets like Khalil Gibran and all such poets who have reached the state of oneness with God. After Realization you can understand and share their joy.

When I was born, My father told Me very clearly that  people are born on the ground floor and if you are born on the tenth floor they cannot understand you. That ‘s why they crucified Christ. What a mistake that was! When Krishna came they said they believed in Rama just as when Christ came  they said  “ We believe in Abraham.” or when Moses came they said “We believe in Abraham.” That’s how they avoided accepting someone who was telling the truth. It is nice to  believe in someone who is dead because you can do whatever you like . He is not going to cause trouble and even if he comes back you will say he is an imposter or kill him, crucify him, give him poison and torture him.

To false people you give money and they will have beds studded with diamonds because they pamper your ego and you want to pay for that pampering. But reality does not pamper you with falsehood.

When you encounter reality you will know that it is the most beautiful thing that you could ever have. It is the source of all joy and happiness. There is nothing more pervading and all-consuming than the bliss of meeting the Divine.

This is such a big subject that in London I must have given at least two hundred speeches, every time something new and still they are not satisfied. I’ve been speaking and speaking and speaking. In this short time I have told you as much as possible so that you can see that you are that beautiful reality which has  been promised by the saints over the ages and that without finding it you are not going to be happy whatever you may have.

I have to work on you like a swimmer has to work to save people who do not know how to swim. And once you start swimming you have to save others. Unless and until you are a swimmer you cannot enjoy the ocean, you are frightened of it. It is within you, just get to know it.

So, for the time being forget what you have read, what you have thought, what you have conceived, receive it as it is.

I hope it will work out today for all of you and then you have to maintain it by understanding fully the problems in your own centres . As I told you, the germination takes place at great speed but you may lose  it again and again because you have to know how to maintain it. This doesn’t happen to everyone but it happens to some and I have to tell you the truth.

So, now let us sit down for our Realization . Let us get our Realization and enjoy the bliss of the gift from our Father who is God Almighty and who is very anxious to give us all that He has because He is generous, compassionate, the Ocean of love.

Whether you have faith in God or not  makes no difference, He still gives you the sun. So it will make no difference to Me whether you believe in Him or not, but you should not insult Him. On the contrary your attitude should be that  “We have not yet met Him so let us be open-minded and when His gift is in us we have to be humble about it.”

If you are arrogant and adamant God is not going to fall at your feet. I am your Mother and I am concerned, that is why I request  and implore you to be humble because there are deities in you who will refuse to act if you are arrogant.

Please tell your mind to wait for a while and not to bother you just now. Through your mental activity you have not achieved anything. So just let the Kundalini act in you.

May God bless you.
