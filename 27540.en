Arrival and advice to Sahaja Yogis in Rome Ashram

[Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Adi Shaki Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai, ki Jai, ki jai]

Shri Mataji: Ah. All right. All right. Sit down. Sit down. All the children sit down. Here. All right. All right.. It's such a surprise. [addressing the children] Are you happy?

Children: Yes.

Shri Mataji: It's such a surprise to see you. So many people coming from the outside room. Such a surprise and such joy. Now what I find, all over the world, that the Sahaj Yogis are getting very responsible. Very responsible and trying to plan out, how to increase the [unclear/ numbers]and also how to increase the quality, and the improvement is tremendous. So what we have to remember that, it is not only if we have regard and respect for Mataji, also it is not sufficient that we are surrendered absolutely. Also that you now have identified Me well, still is not sufficient.

You see as you know, there are many people in other religions also, they all are surrendered, say to Christ. They respect Christ and accept that He was the son of God. But they haven't achieved much.

For your ascent, because you are realised souls, you have to know that your own power must increase. That means you have to trust yourself fully and work it out. Because only through you, people are going to come to Sahaj Yoga. When they see you only, they will think there is something great about it. So you have to work it out properly, by intensive meditation and by collective work. So this will only help, help Sahaj Yoga and help the whole world. Of course, by your shraddha by your faith, you have very great power over the, I mean you can have a great, you can say, a connection with this all-pervading Power, and that you will be able to get all the blessings.

But that should make you more sort of confident, that you have to give it to others. And when it comes to giving to others, then it is important for you to develop your depths, your dimensions and there are so many dimensions within us, which still have to found out, are to be developed. Unless and until you can manage that, spend time on that, introspect, it cannot work. That is what it is. We have to work out ourselves on our own powers. Of course, you have to meditate daily, no doubt. Also, you have to be very collective. But also you have to think, how you will spread Sahaj Yoga and how you will impart this knowledge to others.

Christ had only twelve disciples, and most of them ran away because of Paul and it fell only into the hands of Paul and Peter, whom Christ has described as Satan. So it is Paul who has manufactured all those things that, he will give the key and the church will be established on the rock, is all manufacturing, manufactured by this Mr. Paul on Peter, because he is such a big disciple of Christ. So, that's how we have to understand that, these crooks can spread Christianity so much, why not we, so many pure saints like you? So the responsibility has to be taken, with wisdom and with your powers. That is My message for all the Sahaj Yogis.

The first thing is to know English, because very important. The second one is to know the certain songs by heart. You can compete with each other. This is something simple. Thirdly, look after your body properly - your chakras, your Sahasrara; it’s so important.

Now about the children also. They have found out that, the children in the West are very wild and they think it’s better to keep these children in Dharamsala because also, their immunity system is very poor. What I learnt that here, from their very childhood, people start, doctors start giving them antibiotics. That is how they develop this immunity system in such a, I mean such a bad shape and it's very dangerous because they catch everything. Somebody’s coughing, they start coughing. Somebody has cold, they catch cold - I mean everything. So their immunity system we try to develop. So you have to remember not to take any medicine - Homeopathic or say any other alternative medicine or allopathic medicine - unless and until you have consulted your leader or Me. All the leaders. So that you will know if you can take certain medicines or not. But try to give vibrations. Try to practice vibrations. Have faith in vibrations and faith in yourself. This is going to help you a lot.

I hope you people are all meditating morning and evening. Because Sahaj Yoga is such a thing that, even the smallest drop of the ocean you start enjoying. But we have to not only enjoy ourselves but make the whole world enjoy. Otherwise, you will be selfish.

All right. I am coming back again for the Easter Puja. And then we'll go to the places like Italy, southern Italy, various places like Napoli and Dolores. You all should organise it before coming. Now, what is the program? You want a sing a song? Let's have a song. One song and then I have to go. Without reading from the book. [the songbook] All right.

You have pain now? [To a Sahaja Yogi]. Still, pain? Put your left hand there, left, left. There it’s this side, where you have the pain, on this side you said? Left hand, where you have the pain. left hand up, wherever you have the pain. Put the right hand. Sit down. [Sahaj Yogis sing Mamta Mai]

Now one song from the children. [to Sahaja Yogi with pain] Better now?  Feeling better? [unclear]

Sahaja Yogi: There is a Sahaja Yogini from Perugia who has composed a song for You, Shri Mataji. [song starts]

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much, it’s very nice. Who has done this? [the song]

Sahaja Yogi: Who has done this song?

Shri Mataji: Now the children. Which one do you want to sing? [Children sing]

Shri Mataji: Very sweet. Very beautiful. So now I'll take your leave and I hope to see you all, I think from the 18th, 17th –17th I'll be there. May God bless you. [unclear]

So Guido, you’ll have to telephone to [unclear/Shanti.] Also, you telephone to Me and we'll find out about it. May God bless you.

Yogi: Thank you Shri Mataji.

Children: Thank you Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you. Very good. Very good. Very good. May God bless you. Are you better now? Better?

[Ice creams are distributed. All the children get up to take them]

Shri Mataji [to children]: Sit down. You are not beggars. Sit properly. You are all like prince and princess. Sit and wait. Sit down. Sit down. All of you sit down. [background noise]

[Shri Mataji is given ice cream to eat] I am eating. [unclear name], you didn't get one? Who didn't get? It's very good. Excellent. Is it good now? Is it good? [Children: Yes, good Mataji] Give it to her. There is one there. She didn't get. [Yogi: Who didn’t have?] Who wants? [Yogi: One boy there] One child there.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, Annie came finally.

Shri Mataji: Ah. I didn't see you. How are you?

Yogini: Thank you, Mother.

Yogi: Just came a few days back.

Shri Mataji: Very good, I didn't see her, but somebody told Me and I am very happy to know that she is here. May God bless you. How is the situation there? Still the same?

Yogini: Mother, it's much better. Everything is working slowly slowly. The country is changing.

Shri Mataji: They must have learnt a lesson from this Iraq.

Yogini: And Mother, we put Your picture on the TV. The whole program on TV has changed.

Shri Mataji: My picture on the TV?

Yogini: Yes. On top of the TV. So the whole program in the TV has changed. It was so terrible, especially with children. Because...

Shri Mataji: Teaching them violence.

Yogini: Yes. And all left side stories.

Shri Mataji: About what?

Yogini: To make them upset, to make them cry. All this type of stories for the children.

Shri Mataji: How did they allow you to come here? They allowed you?

Yogini: Yes, with the papers. They are very strict.

Shri Mataji: If Iran could change. What's that? [Seeing big socks given to Her] Very big feet - sometimes they increase, sometimes they decrease, you see, like this. But in America, there are lots of Iranians, who will take to Sahaj Yoga.

Yogini: Also in Iran, all the Sahaj Yogis are Armenian from Russia.

Shri Mataji: How are they?

Yogini: They are good. Especially the new ones. We have a new group of young people and they want to meditate and come for every day.

Shri Mataji: Really? Did you go there?

Yogi: She was there. She just came from there.

Shri Mataji: Iraq?

Both Yogi and Yogini: No Iran. Iran.

Shri Mataji: In Iran? I heard Iraq.

Both Yogi and Yogini: No. No. Iran.

Shri Mataji: Iran. They came all the way?

Yogi: No. These Armenians, they are from Russia but they’re in contact with [unclear name] her mother. So they come for meditation and to their house. But they are all from Russia. Ya. They are coming for meditation.

Shri Mataji: They are allowed for coming to Iraq?

Yogini: Not to Iraq. It is in Iran, in my house in Persia.

Yogi: Persia. Persia. They are in Persia.

Shri Mataji: Persia.

Yogi: Russian Armenians. And they go every day to her mother's house for meditation.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogini: Yes. And they would be very glad if You can come to Turkey.

Shri Mataji: Now Armenia... is more towards Iran.

Yogini: Yes. Iran and Turkey.

Shri Mataji: Turkey. If I go to Turkey, I might be able to see them. They can come to Turkey easily?

Yogini: Yes. They can come. They don't have any problems.

Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji. No problem.

Shri Mataji: But they are accepted as Turkish? No, not yet? They are like refugees.

Yogini: No. They are living in Iran.

Shri Mataji: But they are refugees?

Yogini: No, no, no, they are not refugees. They live there after the war that happened between Armenia and Turkey.

Shri Mataji: Long time back.

Yogini: Long time back. Some went to America, some came to [inaudible] and some went to Europe. So these are the ones that live in Iran and the nice thing is, that after they went to Russia, the vibrations from there collected all the Russian Armenians. You see they are all connected with Russia. They are Armenians but from Russia. So, and also we have one Persian Sahaja Yogini. She is half Russian half Persian.

Shri Mataji: It's quite interesting. But these are Armenians are against the Muslim people, in Russia.

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: They were Christians. These are not.

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: They are Christians or Muslims?

Yogini: Yes. All Armenians are Christians.

Shri Mataji: And they are living in Iran?

Yogini: Yes. I am Armenian.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogini: Also I am Armenian.

Shri Mataji: But you are Christian?

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: I see. There is no objection for Christians to be there, in Iran?

Yogini: No. There are some Zarathustrians and some Jews. Some Armenians, some Bahais, some Australians.

Shri Mataji: Bahais they have tortured there, I think.

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: They don't like Bahais.

Yogini: No.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, there was an Armenian who came to Geneva. He came to Switzerland and he got realisation in Geneva about six months ago, and he went back through Moscow. He is staying with Bogdan for a month and he, when he returned to Armenia, he organised a program. There were more than two hundred people for the program, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: Yes. Yes.

Shri Mataji: How do you go to Armenia?

Yogi: I guess the best will be now through Iran, but otherwise you go to Russia. To Russia, Shri Mataji and Bogdan has been. Bogdan has it under control over there because he, having got realisation in Geneva, he went back through Moscow to Armenia and we have contact with him. So, if You wish to be in Armenia Mother, we know how to get in touch with him.

Shri Mataji: Yes. Of course. Of course.

Yogi: He was very much afraid of organising the program, but he finally did organise it and two hundred people showed up.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: So it was very successful. Bogdan is in touch with him.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogi: Bogdan is in touch with this Armenian.

Shri Mataji: All right. So, perhaps when I go to Russia, we can contact him, would be nice.

Yogini: Also my mother is going to come to Russia.

Shri Mataji: Really? She can?

Yogini: Yes. Her brother is living in Russia.

Shri Mataji: Is he?

Yogini: Yes. So she will come first to Russia [unclear].

Shri Mataji: I hope we get all of them there [unclear] Azerbaijan.

Yogini: We don't really know about it, but this worry is because now Iran is against Azerbaijan, and they give them, they give guns to Armenians and they give petrol to them. So the Armenians fight instead of Iranians and Turkish. And [unclear/Arbat] belongs to Armenians which was taken away by the Turkish people, and now they want it back.

Shri Mataji: My God. [unclear] when I go, we must see. But what about Azerbaijan, he was saying?

Yogi: Alas, Shri Mataji...

Shri Mataji: So many were killed.

Yogi: In Azerbaijan, it’s at the moment a very bad situation, and they are killing [unclear] Also, Azerbaijan –Iran-Azerbaijan and Russian-Azerbaijan - want to be one country, and the Iranian government, at the moment, know that this will be a big danger [unclear] And that way, they are [unclear] now, through the Armenian, bring Azerbaijan down from being their own country. But it is a politic [unclear] And they are making both Azerbaijan, now Iranian-Azerbaijan and Russian-Azerbaijan, both against each other. This is very, very [unclear]

Shri Mataji: Maybe somebody has to go really and talk to them. Some sensible person. [unclear/Otherwise they are] just playing into the hands of the government.

Yogi:[unclear] Shri Mataji. They are very nice people, but you can’t... It is very difficult to talk to these people.

Shri Mataji: Let Me see, I’ll go down. They have given [sounds like/meticulently] - the Russian ambassador invited Me, he honoured Me. He said, ‘We are very thankful for what You have done. We now don't want anything. We don't want any kingdoms. We don't want any [unclear] any money. Nothing. What we want that, in our country, the people should be pure-hearted, clean-hearted as You have described.’

[Yogi translates above conversation in Italian for other Yogis]

Shri Mataji: Russia, I hope it works out, I'll go round. Good idea.

Yogi: We have also a gentleman from Cuba, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: From where?

Yogi: Cuba. Cuba.

Shri Mataji: Ah? May God bless you.

Yogi: They are related to Sandra. This is Sandra's sister and her husband, and this gentleman just came from Cuba - Mr. Santiago. [They pay respects to Shri Mataji]

Shri Mataji: From Cuba?

Yogini: [unclear] not far away from [unclear/Havana] in Cuba, and he may come back to Cuba at the end of May, beginning of June. And he also is the [unclear] of my sister’s and he also came across from Cuba three years ago, and he has three children in Cuba now, and it’s very difficult to go back. And my sister was there [inaudible]. [Cuban Yogi speaks in Spanish]

Yogini [translating for Cuban Yogi]: In Cuba, he says that the situation was very, very difficult. They cannot bring [unclear] when they speak about religion.

Yogi: Have a bandhan to Cuba.

Shri Mataji: Did they have as many [unclear], but ultimately the situation everywhere is so bad, especially in Cuba. [Yogini translates] [unclear] They will have to do it.

Yogi: To Sahaj Yoga. [Yogini translates]

Shri Mataji: And, because this communism has failed and the Cubans are the only people who are trying to keep it [up/out] but it will all be blasted off. [Yogini translates]

First of all [unclear] but then I can go. Of course. I would love to go. My husband has been there three times, because Cuba President was having a problem with his wife. So, I said give a very beautiful statute of so big size out of sandalwood, of Shiva and Parvati, but they are divorced. [Yogini translates]

This Castro, you see. Before was different [unclear] their president. Different [unclear] was their president. [Yogini translates]

He must be having this statue of Shiva and Parvati. My attention has been there. My attention has been very much in Cuba.

Yogini: [inaudible]

Shri Mataji: The first one?

Yogini: Yes it's the first one who has got his realisation and is coming back now to Cuba and he will stay there, because he cannot come out again.

Shri Mataji: It's all right. I'll come now. [Yogini translates]

[Shri Mataji gets up to leave. Jaikara by Sahaj Yogis]

Children: Thank You Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: it's quite a sunny day, today. So the children can play.

Yogi: Thank You Shri Mataji. We’ve had so much rain.
