(All the Sahaj yogis: Bolo Adi Shaki Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai, ki Jai, ki jai)

Ah. Alright. Alright. Sit down. Sit down. All the children sit down. Here. Alright. Alright.. It's such a surprise. You are happy? (Shri Mataji addresses the children)

Children: Yes.

It's such a surprise to see you. So many people coming from the outside room. Such surprise and such joy. Now what I find, all over the world, that the Sahaj yogis are getting very responsible. Very responsible and trying to plan out, how to increase the quantity (inaudible) and also how to increase the quality and the improvement is tremendous. So, what we have to remember, it is not only if we have regard and respect for Mataji, also it is not sufficient that we are surrendered absolutely. Also that you now have identified me well, still is not sufficient.

You see as you know, there are people in other religions also, they all are surrendered say to Christ. They respect Christ and accept that he was the son of God. But they haven't achieved much.

For your ascent, because you are realized souls, you have to know that your own power must increase. That means you have to trust yourself fully and work it out. Because only through you, people are going to come to Sahaj Yoga. When they see you only, they will think there is something great about it. So you have to work it out properly by intensive meditation and by collective work. So this will only help, help Sahaj yoga and help the whole world. Of course, by your Shraddha by your faith, you have very great power over the, I mean you can have a great, you can say a connection with this all-pervading power, and that you will be able to get all the blessings.

But that should make you more sort of confident, that you have to give it to others. And when it comes to giving to others, then it is important for you to develop your depths, your dimensions and there are so many dimensions within us, which still have to found out, are to be developed. Unless and until you can manage that, spend time on that, introspect, you cannot do. That is what it is. We have to work out ourselves on our own powers. Of course, you have to meditate daily no doubt. Also, you have to be very collective. But also you have to think, how you will spread Sahaj yoga and how you will impart this knowledge to others.

Christ had only 12 disciples and most of them ran away because of Paul and it fell only into the hands of Paul and Peter, who Christ has described as Satan. So it is Paul who has manufactured all those things, that he will give the key and the church will be established (unclear). All manufacturing, manufactured by this Mr.Paul on Peter because he is such a big disciple of Christ. So, that's how we have to understand, that these crooks can spread Christianity so much. Why not we, so many pure saints like you? So the responsibility has to be taken with wisdom and with powers. That is my message for all the Sahaj Yogis.

The first thing is to know English because very important. The second one is to know certain songs by heart. You can compete with each other. This is something simple. Thirdly look after your body properly. Your Chakras, your Sahasrar, everything is so important.

Now about the children also. They have found out, that the children in the West are very wild and I think it better to keep these children in Dharamsala because also their immunity system is very poor. What I learnt that, from their very childhood, people start, doctors start giving them antibiotics. That is how they develop this immunity system in such a, I mean such a bad shape and it's very dangerous because they catch everything. One coughing they start coughing. Somebody has a cold, they catch a cold. I mean everything. So their immunity system we try to develop. So you must remember not to hand any medicine, Homeopathic or say any other alternatives medicine or allopathic medicine, unless and until you have consulted the leader or me. All the leaders. So that you will know if you can take certain medications or not. But try to give vibrations. Try to practice vibrations. Have faith in vibrations and faith in yourself. This is going to help you a lot.

I hope you people are all meditating morning and evening. Because Sahaj Yoga is such a thing, that even the smallest drop of the ocean you start enjoying. But we have to not only enjoy ourselves but make the whole world enjoy. Otherwise, you will be selfish.

Alright. I am coming back again for the Easter Puja. And then we'll go to places like Italy, southern Italy, various places like Napoli and Dolores. You all should organize it before coming. Now, what is the program? You want a sing a song? Let's have a song. One song and then I have to go. Without (Shri Mataji is saying 'without' for the songbook I .e.sing without seeing the book) Alright.

You have pain now? (To some Sahaj yogi). Still, pain? Put your left hand there. Here on this site, where you have the pain. Left side, Left hand where you have the pain. left hand, wherever you have the pain. Put the right hand. Sit down. (Sahaj yogis start singing bhajan) Now one song from the children. (to the Sahaj yogi who has pain) Now feeling better? (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: To make them upset to make them cry. All left side stories for children. Shri Mataji: How did they allow you to come here? Did they allow you?

Sahaj Yogini: Yes, with the papers. They are very strict.

Shri Mataji: If Iran could change. What's that? (Seeings the big socks ) Very big people. sometimes they increase sometimes they decrease. (Inaudible) But in America, there are lots of Iranians, who will take to Sahaj Yoga.

Sahaj yogini: Also in Iran, all Sahaj yogis are Armenian from Russia. Shri Mataji: How are they?

Sahaj yogini: All are good. Especially the new ones. We have a new group of young people and they want to meditate and come for every day.

Shri Mataji: Really? Did you go there?

Sahaj yogi: She was there. She just came from there. Shri Mataji: Iraq?

Both yogi and yogini: No Iran. Iran.

Shri Mataji: In Iran? I heard Iraq.

Both yogi and yogini: No. No. Iran.

Shri Mataji: Iran. Do they come all the way?

Sahaj yogi: No. These Armenians, they are from Russia but they have contacted her mother. So they come for meditation to their house. But they are all from Russia. Ya. They are coming for meditation.

Shri Mataji: They are allowed for coming to Iraq? Yogini: Not to Iraq. It is in Iran in my house in Persia. Yogi: Persia. Persia. They are in Persia.

Yogini: Yes. Iran and Turkey

Shri Mataji: Turkey. If I go to Turkey, I might be able to see them. They can come to Turkey easily?

Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji. No problem.

Shri Mataji: But they are accepted as Turkish? No, not yet? They are like refugees.

Yogini: No. They are living in Iran.

Yogini: No.No.No, they are not refugees. They live there after the war that happened between Armenia and Turkey.

Shri Mataji: Long time back.

Yogini: Long time back. Some went to America, some came to (inaudible) some went to Europe. So these are the ones that live in Iran and the nice thing is, that after they went to Russia the vibrations from there collected all the Russian Armenians. You see they are all connected with Russia. They are Armenians but from Russia. So, and also we have one Persian Sahaj yogini. She is half Russian half Persian.

Yogi: Shri Mataji there was an Armenian who came to Geneva. He came to Swiss. And he got realization in Geneva about six months ago and he went back through Moscow.

Shri Mataji: Is he?

Yogini: Yes. So first she is going to come first to Russia to her brother.

Shri Mataji: I hope we get all of them there from this Azerbaijan.

Yogini: We don't really know about them, but this worry is because now Iran is against Azerbaijan. They give them, they give grants to Armenians and they give petrol to them. So Armenians fight instead of Iranians and Turkish. And one of those belongs to Armenian people which was taken away by Turkish people and now they want him back.
