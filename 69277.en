Dr Rustom – Answer And Questions
Rome Ashram - Nirmala House, Rome (Italy) | Transcript (English) – VERIFIED

Dr Rustom: ...  sense academic, they’re OK for people who just started Sahaja Yoga. But you are to be a deep Sahaja yogi and someone that of the very limits of what any Sahaja yogi can achieve at that one moment of time, and you have to know that you are always working on your environment and at the same time, always attached by it and not working on it. And this is something very important because this is the essence of Sahaja Yoga. This is why we are so important as Sahaja yogis because it’s only we can do this job, and this is why every Sahaja yogi should take this very seriously and always surrender himself [unclear] to Shri Mataji. And, surrender means being receptive, being like an open bowl, into which She can pour whatever She wishes, without any resistance. People talk a lot about surrender, but surrender is something very simple, and you don’t need to think about it or work it out. You just have to be quiet, still and non-thinking, and [unclear] everything works out automatically. So, one is put here, you see, where is the point of connection between the world and the divine. Shri Mataji, you see, is always infinite. So it is very hard for the divine to do this job on its own. Sahaja yogis are the only people who contain both things in them, as being cells in the body of Shri Mataji as well as being human beings with their whole situations in life. So, this is actually what I wanted to speak about today when I first came here to try to work out, how to express the fact that by working on the subtle or in any way, allowing one being to be used as a means of working on the subtle, how you can change the Universe. People always say - ‘well, Sahaja Yoga doesn’t spread’, you see. The reason is that they try to spread it at a gross level. And it’s like trying to build a house without foundations. But if you work it out on a subtle level or allow God to work it out at a subtle level then everything happens automatically, you don’t have to spread Sahaja Yoga, people will come to you drawn by the magnetism of the [unclear, stars]. But the state, you see, it’s very difficult because one has to be both, active and passive at the same time, one has to achieve without taking credit for one's achievement. It’s like being suspended above the activity while taking part in the activity. It’s a mixture of contradictions of opposites and, it requires a very disciplined attention, a very stable attention, to be able to witness these, and to be able to let it work out. And if this is so, you see, one thing that comes true is that the whole matter revolves around one’s relationship with the Absolute and one’s relationships to one's world and not to other Sahaja yogis or anything because the connection is direct it goes like that - in a long [unclear] way, it’s not horizontal. You see, what other Sahaja yogis do should not affect what you are doing because this is a direct relationship between oneself and God. But it’s only those Sahaja yogis who can establish deeply their relationship with Shri Mataji who can do this. I read a little thing [unclear, for the reason] to suggest recently which was quite illuminating to me where someone said that “prayer is when you talk to God, and meditation is when you listen to Him.” And I think that is why it is so important for Sahaja yogis to meditate because in a sense you are listening to Shri Mataji when you meditate. You may not be listening in your head but, every single chakra, every deity in every chakra is listening to the instructions that are flowing. You may not know what’s going on in your body, but that’s not important. As you get subtler, you will be able to feel it. The important thing is, that it’s happening and with that daily meditation which establishes the relationship between yourself and God which you can then use to transform the relationship between yourself and your world and your environment. This is, actually, the job of a Sahaja yogi to act as this sort of instrument, and all the pujas we do, and everything we do should be geared to that thing. And the most important relationship between oneself and Shri Mataji is between one's chakras and Her power. I mean, people get deluded into saying that ‘so-and-so is close to Shri Mataji and so-and-so is not close to Shri Mataji’ and all this sort of stuff. That closeness is never expressed at an external level, it is always something within. I mean, people can spend two or three years with Shri Mataji, very close to Her and still not develop at all, [unclear] we know. There are others, who may never see Her and develop continuously because it's an internal thing, because Shri Mataji is the All-pervading power of the Universe. And I think that is, - even if one does not get a chance to be near Her, it does not stop your progress in developing your relationship with Her. In some sense, you progress faster because you are not deluded by all the maya that surround a physical incarnation. Certainly, when I was away in Arabia for four years, I so Shri Mataji very rarely. But, this has not stopped me from progressing. I think that I progressed faster [unclear, being somewhere else] because, one gave up the personal relationship [unclear, with Her] and dealt with a true relationship which is within.

Question: [inaudible]

Dr Rustom: I can not say that because I don’t know why human beings are created but, certainly, it is the way that human beings can be used. As for why they were created, I think - who knows?

A yogi is translating in Italian.

Dr Rustom: Any other questions?

Yogi: You had mentioned about the [unclear] the soul, something we [unclear don’t know] about [unclear] a little bit expand it or maybe a little bit about the form, the relationship with the Spirit and especially after realisation.

Dr Rustom: But I don’t know much about the soul, either. I think that the soul is more important possibly before realisation than after realisation. I think generally before realisation, the soul is supposed to be that part of the human being which has lost the earth element and therefore lost the ability to appear in a body, but the rest of the human being is still visible, and as such the soul has all the capacities of a human being with the emotional body etc. without the capacity to incarnate or walk in this world. It is said that before realisation after death the soul separates from the  Kundalini, from the atma, and that the soul therefore is free to act as it wishes without the control of Kundalini and the Spirit. But it is also known that after realisation this doesn’t happen, that when the soul leaves the body it leaves it completely with the Kundalini and Atma. So, [unclear] the soul is a human being without a body, I think is the best way to describe it. And before realisation, it has the capacity to do evil things [unclear, becomes a bhoot] as we call it, and after realisation, it has the capacity to become something else. I think that would be the description of what is the soul.

If you take this further, you see, you can see that in an unrealised soul or even in a realised soul for that matter, but if you take an unrealised soul to evolve it has to incarnate in this world. To incarnate on this world, he has to take the earth element back into his soul. For a realised soul to walk in this world, he also probably needs to take the earth element back into his soul and incarnate. The earth element, as you know, is ruled by Lord Ganesha. So it seems that for something, that is potential, to become actual and to become manifested in nature, one needs the power of Lord Ganesha, you see, which is manifest throughout nature, and it indicates how one can use this power correctly till purifies [unclear, and evolves one] and does the same to one's actions. So, in a way, you can say that for the desire, the potential desire for Ida Nadi to manifest in a form which the Sushumna can use, one needs the power of Lord Ganesha. It has to pass through that, so it indicates the importance of the power of the Muladhara chakra.

Yogi: No, is not a question. He said that the power of the Ida Nadi can be used for the purpose of the Sushumna and Dr Rustom said correct.

Translate it into Italian.

Dr Rustom: The Ida is the power of desire, but desire cannot be made manifest, you see, without the power of Lord Ganesha Himself.

Question: How can we stabilise our attention and increase our Shraddha?

Dr Rustom: If your attention is stabilised, Shraddha automatically increases, everything increases automatically with a stable attention. The thing [unclear] how to stabilise one attention is through self-discipline. I think this is the way to describe it. That there should be certain moments of the day when you take yourself in hand and say - ‘no. Now, so-and-so don’t do this, just keep your attention steady.’ But keeping your attention steady is not the same as fixing that on the Sahasrara or Agnya or whatever it is, because that’s not keeping it steady, it’s fixing it on some point which is not what you want to do. An attention which is stable, it is like a knife floating free in the universe not fixed to anything, and it just lays there in the universe, and anything that goes past it, is like cutting into two by it, and that is a stable attention. It is not an attention fixed here and there or anywhere else, you see, and that is very difficult again for human beings to do because the ego is used to think [unclear] finite. Things have to be fixed here or there or somewhere else. But the Spirit or the divine is not interested in such a thing. It has absolute control of the Universe. It is not concerned whether something is fixed here or there or anywhere else. I think that will be the answer to your question.

The answer is repeated and translated into Italian language.

Question: [inaudible]

Dr Rustom: It’s a subtle thing actually, you can say in some way that awareness is the power of consciousness. Consciousness is one of the functions of the brain and to some extent of the ego. To be conscious that a tree is green, for instance, is the act of consciousness. Awareness is something else. Awareness tends to work within you unconscious, you are aware of things without necessarily being conscious of them. Sometimes awareness comes into consciousness when you become conscious of something of which you were originally aware. Awareness to some extent is one of the powers of the attention. OK? So, your attention makes you aware of things. The attention is the means by which you become aware of things. And that awareness from the attention when comes into consciousness, then you become conscious of things. Before realisation, there is an absolute gap between awareness and consciousness, but after realisation, as the brain becomes more and more illuminated all awareness becomes conscious, and all consciousness becomes united with the awareness. I think that is the best way to describe it.

Question: [inaudible]

Dr Rustom: [unclear, Don’t] get too involved in all these things. They are just instruments of the being, if you like, or understanding and working out whatever needs to be worked out in the universe there’s nothing absolute about any of these just as nothing is absolute about the power of seeing or the power to speak or the power to understand, you see. They are all just parts of your being. There is nothing absolute, they are all finite. They are not infinite.

Question: [inaudible]

Dr Rustom: Dreams can be very helpful in guiding you back if you have gone off and [unclear] trapped. The thing is being able to understand them, which not many people can do.

Question: [Inaudible]

Dr Rustom: Yes, in the sense that Jung saw many things in dreams, [unclear] the whole description of the archetypes is to some extent the description of the way that the soul is structured, or the psyche is structured. But the point is that Jung's dreams - interpretation of dreams is very slow compared to what a Sahaja yogi can do. It’s good for a Sahaja yogi to know how Jung did it because that’s one of the means, is that A, B, C of dream analysis. But the difference between what Jung could do and what a Sahaja yogi can do is the difference between what you can do in the first or second years of school and what you can do in university. But you need to have gone through the first and second years of school. Anything else?

Question: [Inaudible]

Dr Rustom: You see, all these things are for people who are not realised, they are completely unimportant for the realised souls, [unclear, the bad thing is that it’s] harmful for the realised souls to concentrate on these things because as if you can run, is as [unclear, a first race...], but then you say - no - I have to control every step, and then you walk it about one mile in an hour because you’ve to see exactly how the foot falls to make sure that the toe is pressed onto the ground properly then you take your next step, it’s a bit like that.

Question: [Inaudible, in the Italian language].  A yogi repeats the question: “The question is - what happens when supposing somebody who gets his realisation, and then he gives up, he doesn’t continue with the meditation, what happens to the person what happens with the relationship between the soul, the Kundalini?

Dr Rustom: You see, it is not whether one meditates is so important, it is whether one continues to acknowledge Shri Mataji for what She is. If one doesn’t meditate, but one still accepts that Shri Mataji is what She is and still accepts [unclear] Sahaja yogi, in the end, the unconscious itself will work things out such that it will begin to meditate when it is necessary. The essence of Sahaja Yoga is not all these practices. They help a lot to strengthen you. The essence of Sahaja Yoga is whether or not you accept Shri Mataji for what She is.

Question: [inaudible]

Dr Rustom: You see, the main progress spiritually [unclear] the Kundalini works things out. But, it’s not the same as if you are a Sahaja yogi [unclear] don’t act to do anything against Shri Mataji. It’s possible that in the future at some time perhaps in another birth when they will get their chance [unclear, and they want] to use it. [unclear] people who actually reject Shri Mataji saying that She is not this [unclear], who are against it, [unclear, who are the] people who suffer.

Question: Why when a certain standard of peace is achieved why one's attention tend to go to negative things?

Dr Rustom: Because, you see, you are talking about it in ascend, and there is a difference between that which has been achieved and that which has not yet been achieved. A human being starts from a very low level at the beginning to ascend, and it is very easy for their attention to go back to that which they know, and to be [unclear] which they do not yet know, you see, which is still to come.  And not that one, - and also the second thing is that the world is full of negativity, how many Sahaja yogis are there how many other human beings are there? If you see the proportion. So, when you stop, if you like, in your motion, then there is a tendency to be pulled backwards there is no doubt about this. But, it’s like, if you like building a house. Up to a certain point things are unstable, then you make a certain thing and all that part which you have achieved become stabilised. Then you have to go on to the next step, which is unstable for a certain time until you can stabilise it. And so it goes on. It’s a progression, and there is always a backwards and forward movement in this, you see. The important thing is to be able to recognise when things around are stable and that point too, with your attention or with your discipline, you stabilise the motion and to know when things are stabilised and when you can relax your attention because everything is automatically fixed.

It’s noon time now it’s getting hot. So, I think we should have a break.
