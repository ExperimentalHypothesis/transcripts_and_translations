I bow to all the seekers of truth.

[Marathi]

Please let me talk for some time in Hindi, and then I will speak in Marathi.

[Hindi]

Nowadays, truth is being searched all across the world. This is because people think they are in confusion, and that the confusion is because they do not know what the truth is. It might be that this feeling might not be so high in our country, but this is a very powerful sentiment in other countries across the world. And it should also be so in our country. Now, if you read the newspapers every day, all you will hear is about how so many people are involved in thuggery, in thieving, and are living their lives by indulging in all sorts of wrong activities. There is corruption; you hear so much about it. It wasn't so in the past. The reason for this is that man has lost his way. He doesn't know which way to go. He doesn't know the reason why he has received this body, this intellect. And this is the reason why with this same body, he carries out all sorts of wrong activities. Now there must be some arrangement or some setting within us to right this wrong, simply because the God who has made us, isn't going to throw us down on this wrong path. He will definitely have made some arrangement or the other to ensure that we remain on the right track.

Now people will argue whether it is necessary to walk on the right path. If you do not walk on the right path, the person who will have the most damage is you yourself. Of course, society is hampered too. But the most damage that you do to yourself is that you will have lost your self-respect. You will have lost your righteousness, or any sense of shame that you might have had. This is not a sign of humanity. But everyone talks about this; there isn't anything new about this here. Reading this sort of thing everyday is very troubling. I haven’t never heard of such unethical behaviour. People have become so unethical; your children have become unethical. Their behaviour has become unethical. At least now we should begin to understand. And we should begin to think about why God has given us so much independence in this world.

The reason we have so much independence, we should understand that we should become enlightened ourselves. We should make ourselves more mature. We should have a new awakening within ourselves. He (God) has also made this arrangement within us where we have this Kundalini lying within us in our sacrum bone. We have had so much written about this in our country since so long ago. We should awaken it, and through this enlightened awakening, we should, automatically, become a person of a special personality. Automatically. This is your own power that is helping in your evolution. When this evolution happens, Man will change. There is a complete transformation. Just think - if the politicians and governors of today become evolved, then our fortunes will prosper. Nothing wrong will happen. There will be nothing to worry about. And everything will become beautiful. So much so that when this power starts flowing through you, you become so able, that your farming becomes OK, your household becomes balanced, your relations become OK. A beautiful feeling of love prevails everywhere.

A big problem of current times is that people are forever running for more power. Somehow, power had to be obtained. But what is the use of giving power to someone, if that person doesn't have any power over himself? If one cannot govern one’s own self, control one’s own self, then you can only bring about destruction for everyone by garnering power. It is important to have introspection first before you get this power. Now it has been said that there is a spirit within us, and that we should be able to see this spirit, and that we should have self-realisation. All this has been written about. And also about how your body, mind, intellect and soul should become blessed. God has made a full arrangement for all of this within us. You are now aware how beautiful an arrangement has been made within you. You will be astounded when you find the wondrous ecosystem that has been created within you. And you cannot pay for this experience of having your Kundalini awakened. This is something spontaneous. Now if a seed germinates, do you give anyone any money? Do you pay the ground, or do you pay the seed? It germinates spontaneously. Similarly, this living power (Shakti) germinates automatically within you.

However, just as only a lamp that has been lit can give light to another, similarly.. This awakening can only be given to someone by a person who himself is awakened. But there is no give and take in this. Nor will his power be diminished, nor will he be adversely affected in any way. People say that there is a lot of danger in the awakening of the Kundalini. Now, I have been doing this for 30 years. I have never seen anyone having had any problem or being affected badly. Nothing.

So then, you should realise that you really haven't understood yourself. That there is this power within us. Just think.. If anyone told a person that he has this big treasure hidden within him. He will start jumping around. But I am saying that this power is manifested within you, and you are verily going to experience it today. Now. These subtle chakras that reside within you, that control your physical, intellectual, psychological and spiritual elements - they will all become enlightened. And it makes them whole (complete). Just as a pearl is tied into a necklace with a string, similarly, this Kundalini ties everyone together using its own formula. And when She (the Kundalini) does this, there is no certificate required from anyone. You just know. Your physical, intellectual, psychological - all 3 elements - become OK. And your fourth power, which we call spiritual - you come into that spirituality. I mean that your spirit enlightens your attention. Your attention becomes enlightened and wherever this attention goes, it starts working.

Now surely, you cannot blame God if you do remain ignorant of this great energy residing within you or if you choose to stay away from it. But this darkness of ours, and this extreme encroachment of our intellect will slowly turn our intelligence into an idiocy. This wisdom also comes about due to the awakening of the Kundalini. The reason is that with the awakening, the Kundalini pierces the Brahmarandra (the Sahasrar) and creates a union with this all-encompassing divine presence, which is also called the Param Chaitanya. This creates a relation between you and this supreme power that is running the whole universe. Einstein has called this the Torsion Area. When you create a link to this, it will only know the truth. This is the infallible truth. Oh yes! This much is true, that sometimes a mistake might happen if you give it to a person without checking his vibrations or has negative energies surrounding him. Then surely, a mistake might happen. But if you do pay attention, you can figure out what kind of a person he is. You will always know the subtle truth about everything, and you will be drenched in that truth. You won't believe that truth and love are the same thing. If you love someone, you know everything there is to know about that person. But here I am talking about this truth that is all-pervading all across the universe. But the power that resides in this truth is that of love. Just think that you are completely overwhelmed with that love. But you are currently not touched by it because you are disconnected from it. Now this event is going to happen. 

[Mother now switches to Marathi]

Now I will speak in Marathi, because you have not yet properly learnt the Hindi language. You should learn it. Hindi is our national language. You should know that language. People in the south of India have managed to learn it, but not so in Maharashtra. This is very surprising. On the other hand, there is no other language like Marathi. Extremely optimum language. There is no doubt about it. But Hindi is our national language, and if we can speak our national language, that will automatically improve our own language. And then people will understand the importance of Marathi. But if we will only create a link with Marathi, and say that we will only speak Marathi, then.. We are citizens of this country. We should properly understand the national language of that country. Me... I learnt everything in Marathi. I was taught in Marathi in class attending a Marathi medium school. But my father was a very prominent freedom fighter (during the struggle for Indian independence). He said...”Nothing down. You absolutely have to learn Hindi.” And I too had a love for it. So everyone in my household knew both Hindi and Marathi languages. So it is important that we should swear an oath to ourselves that we should definitely learn the Hindi language. This is my request to you all. 

I feel very sad seeing our country having been separated into many small corners. Especially, in Maharashtra, that love for your motherland does not exist any longer. Not in the form that it is required. It is surprising. Brave men like Shivaji Maharaj have taken birth here. That love for the nation does not exist now. The whole attention is towards money. Any which way, the attention is towards money. I haven't ever seen anyone who is at peace because of money. Once money comes into the picture, then all sorts of activities begin. Drinking, this thing, that activity. I have very rarely seen anyone who is prosperous who might also be a truly charitable person. Otherwise, they are all drunkards or whatever other activities they indulge into. Lakshmi (prosperity) is a fleeting thing. To sustain it, you should have a sense of balance within yourself. Until you have that balance, it doesn't matter how much money you have, or whatever you might have attained. You will not be able to attain that joy. 

Ananda (joy) is not something that can be defined because there is no analogy for it. There are no two sides of happiness or sadness in this joy. There is only joy; nothing else. And like Dnyaneshwar has said: “Soni Yaacha Didhan Yei”. (A golden day will come). That has now come. That has now manifested. All you have to do is to realise what it is, and obtain it. But you are not subtle. Your attention is not on the subtle. Then what should we do? You will be surprised to know that there are so many saints who have taken birth in this land of Maharashtra. And they laid their lives down for this divine work that they carried out. They shed their blood for it. Nothing of the sort has happened in the North of India. But Sahajayoga is spreading like wildfire there in households across the land. I am surprised as to where they have come from and whose blessing is it? After all, we had so many saints here. Of course, all of them were tortured. It is not like they were really felicitated then. All of them were tortured. And now I wonder what has happened to all that work all of them did. 

Now this is something that has to be understood - what are these problems that we have within us? Mainly, it is ritualistic people. They will have an array of gods kept in front of them. They will have a bath at 4 in the morning, because then they need to cook at 6 AM. So they will wake up at 4 and start their prayers. A full array of gods. I know, I have so many Sahaja Yogis who used to have them too. Continue praying to all these gods. Then they will have to visit one temple after the other. Now how are you going to figure out which is the real temple, which god actually exists there, or whether one actually manifests in there? Anyone says anything - they will start following that path. There are long queues formed. I saw once - there was this procession of women carrying this big platform and walking towards Alandi (Alandi is a village outside Pune where St Dnyaneshwar lived). One woman fell unconscious. What is going on? What is this madness for? If not that, then they are continuing with their cymbals on the way to Pandharpur (another village where lots of saints lived during the middle ages). One should see what these people actually obtained with all this clanging of their cymbals. Who put this ritual up? Did they get something out of it? Did they have any benefit from all of this? All this should be checked, shouldn't it? This is all just a waste of time. Then... they have this procession via palanquin for St Dnyaneshwar. My dear, he didn't even have slippers on his feet. How did we forget all of this? “Now they are taking processions out, and then they will go to random houses and ask for food. They will go to each village and eat over there. Why? Because we carried the palanquin?!? And some “paduka” (footwear) is kept in it. So suddenly we have a right. Any village that we go into - you have to serve us food.” The kids are laughing... but there are many who act like this. Now please leave this all behind, for god’s sake. I have come to Pune just for this. One gentleman asked me why I had come to Pune. I told him that this is called PunyaPatnam (the land of blessings). That is why I have come here. There is no other relation here for me here, just a relation of blessing. He replied: “Dear O Dear. Frauds - this is a word that can be associated with people from Pune.” I was left speechless. “If you call someone “bhampta” (a fraud), he has to be someone from Pune.” Now what is this going on? “My dear Mataji, you just have a look. This is very well known.” I was flabbergasted. How did “Punyapatnam” become famous for this sort of thing? Where has all the wisdom gone? And where did that sacredness go? You do not get blessings without something sacred. 

So now you should realise, that if you want to transform this Maharashtra really into a MahaRashtra (a great state), then you have to get ready for the awakening of the Kundalini. Not just your own, but also others. I have been struggling here in Maharashtra for the last 20 years. Going into villages everywhere, but no one seems to understand it at all. Now someone will come in - they will give me one rupee. So they will be told that Mother doesn't take one rupee. “Ok, then should I give her 10 rupees?” I mean, something completely different is sitting there in their head. That has to be removed. Only once that is removed will you realise that you haven't actually gained anything yet. What do you need to obtain? Atma-Sakshatkar (the awakening of the spirit, the self realisation). And you should experience it. It cannot happen just by someone coming along and saying that they will give it to you. It will not happen like that. It has to be experienced. AdiShankaracharya has described it clearly saying that you should have this vibration in you. He has described it as “Spand”, which we describe in English as vibrations. You should have those vibrations in you. Once you experience those vibrations, you will find out what chakras of yours are catching, and which ones of other people. And you should be able to heal those chakras. Now it has been many years since he has said this. All his teachings have been closed and put away and people just have readings of it, that's all. One they have these readings, then you have these big intellectuals. That's what I would call them. It is impossible for them to get this subtlety because the brain is continually working around in circles. He had asked to go beyond it all. Einstein said this, a lot of other people have described this. There was one called Jung; I mean even in other lands people have spoken about it that unless you go beyond this brain, you cannot obtain the truth. You wont get it using your brain.

It doesn't matter how long I give you speeches. That is no guarantee that it will give you self realisation. YOu have to get that awakening. It has to happen. Only then will you become self realised. Someone told me that he would give me 100,000 rupees for me to awaken his Kundalini. I told him that even if you give me double that it is not possible. She (the Kundalini) doesn't understand all this - 100,000 or 200,000. All She understands is whether you have the pure desire. Because the Kundalini is pure desire. If your pure desire is to just obtain the truth, and nothing else, only then will She awaken. But nowadays, there are a lot of different kinds of people who are talking. Just a couple of days ago, I listened to a speech by one Sadhubaba (a religious leader). I was very surprised to see how he was attracting people towards him. How he was understanding these people. He clearly told them: “You are not on the road for Nivrutti (salvation). No, but you are on the path for Pravrutti (the path of action with a focus on the outside world).” Now isn't that just an insult? If you are on the path for Pravrutti, that just means that you are running after each other all the time. So he said: “You should not take to the path of knowledge (Dnyaana-maarg).” Now Sahaja Yoga is the path of knowledge. So he was saying not to take this path. Krishna has told everyone to take the path of knowledge. So this Saadhu was telling his audience not to take to the path of knowledge but to remain servile to him. Be servile to him, the Guru and treat him and feed him very well. So maybe in the next birth, it would be very possible that you might then take to the path for salvation (Nivrutti). 

But this is the identity of a Maharashtrian. To be on the path for salvation. Since childhood you all have been reciting the verses of Shri Ramadas. You have been reading the writings of all the great saints. And how then can you ... you will have to become Nivruti (attaining awakening), because everything here is awakened. Who can say that this is not possible for you? If you want to be trapped in this external world, that is your choice. This is not proper though. You all know this because this land where you all have been born - this is MahaRashtra (the Great State). So you have to maintain it’s respect. Now what will you have gained if you go any other place like Delhi, but if you are behaving nonsensically? People will not even look at you tomorrow; this will be the situation. So you have to remember that you are from Maharashtra. And according to me, a person from Maharashtra will always be on the path to salvation. On the path to salvation...

But even that is now difficult. Why - because someone is just singing bhajans, someone is sitting elsewhere. Not like this. Today, the time has come that all such people absolutely will get their self realisation. If you have the pure desire, you will get the awakening. There will be no other way. But it has to be spread. It should be given to others. I know there also are a lot of Sahaja Yogis here. If each of you gives this to a hundred people, then this will spread all across the land. Now what is the need for this? The need is so because the subtlety within humans is all tied up. All the Shadripus (the 6 enemies of the mind) have tied this subtlety up. Now the only way out of this is to obtain a union with the spirit. Otherwise even these miniscule things will be the reason for your destruction. I will not tell you to behave one way or the other. Nothing of the sort. Do whatever you want. But once you attain realisation, you will not do this yourself. Because then, you will be the spirit. How will you do these things when you are in the light of the spirit? You will automatically get the discretion that this is something wrong and not to be done. There is no restriction on you. Just come here and get your realisation. And then we can talk about it. People have weaned off alcohol and other such vices. They have become good and come on to a righteous path. All their vices have fallen away. They say there are a lot of unethical behaviours on display here in Pune. All of that will be destroyed right from its roots. You just have to begin your journey with Sahaja yoga. Whatever be your situation, Sahaja Yoga should be spread. 

I have been giving speeches in Pune for so many years now. It has spread of course. But it should go to each and every village. This is Maharashtra. In all of India, there is no other land like Maharashtra. But I cannot say that now. Everything has to be seen in balance. In my childhood, we used to sing this song - “Priya Amucha Maharashtra Desha” (My beloved Maharashtra). And it was so well described. I don't know where all that has gone. It all looks so different now. So again, this is a request from the bottom of my heart to take your realisation. You know everything there is to know about Sahaja Yoga. There is no need to tell you anything about it - that the Kundalini is awakened, and that this leads to your chakras being cleaned out, and that you start feeling the vibrations in your hand. And that due to this there is the manifestation of a new realm within you. And I call that status as Sahaja-Awastha (a state of Sahaja). You are simply in joy. That is what should happen. Then you will see what all you get, and how much progress you see. All the benefits - see all of that. But then you aren't even ready to come into Sahaja Yoga? Leave aside those intellectuals. Let them be with their brains. Who is going to go and argue with them? Dynaneshwar has written such great things - Amrutanubhav. Maybe they (the intellectuals) should at least read it once. What use is this intellect? If this was useful, would our country be in such a state? So, if you really want to make this intellect something of a miracle. If you really want it shining, then you have to ensure that it sits in the light of the spirit. 

And you all already have this in you. Imagine there is this machine in you. Everything is already set in the right place for you. And if you were just to start it once, only then will it start working out, won’t it? But even though you have it, if you are not ready to start it, then what can one say? Crying out night and day. You don't feel like reading any newspaper. Night and day, it is the same sorry state. Now, once you get awakened, then let's see what happens. Then let's talk. What are you going to say standing on the sidelines?

But those who are drowning - shouldn't they be saved? There is a dire need for this. I have told you this many-a-times that this will have to work out from within Maharashtra. We have the blessings of the saints with us. There have been great saints here. But people will go to their samadhis (the place of final resting for these saints) and sit down and cry. But shouldn't you first understand who they were, and what they obtained and how they obtained it? Now these people can sing Marathi bhajans very nicely. And they can sing it in 1 or 2 days. How did this happen? After all, forget Marathi, they didn't even know how to speak Hindi. How did this happen? How? You should understand this. So these people (Mother is referring to the Western Yogis), they went to Tukaram’s mount (Tukaram is one of Maharashtra’s most revered and famous saints) and they kissed the ground there. So the people who went with them were surprised - what has happened to these people? They were kissing the ground there. So I asked them why they were doing so. They replied: “Mother, there were such vibrations emitting there. Fountains of it. From within the ground..” Now you haven't even recognised Tukaram. These people have recognised him. 

So if we want to bring peace to this society, this country, this world, and if we want to bring in a kingdom of peace and joy, then everyone should get their awakening. And not just getting their awakening. But getting their own, and then giving it to others. This is half-heartedness to come to Mataji’s programs, getting their awakening, and then they are nowhere to be seen. After the program I asked how many people came. They will say that a lot of people did come for the program, but only 10 people followed up. Is that so? So only a few handpicked people come in. So I have said this to you a lot of times about Kundalini, but again I should say that the time has now come. Now when are you going to get your awakening and give it to others? And giving awakening to others is a very important task. There is no other act of virtue beyond this. Everything else is worthless. Ask those who you have given realisation and helped bring them back up.

Recently there was this gentleman who came to meet me from Mumbai. He ran a school for the mute. He had brought one such kid along with him. He might have been able to speak a little or hear a little. But still he got a job with a salary of 12,000 rupees. It was a wonder. The gentleman said: “Mother, this kid is so singularly minded, that the employers immediately took him on. He couldn't really speak. He had started speaking a bit due to Sahaja Yoga, and he was still a little deaf. But still that didn't matter because he was a good human being. He was steadfast. He had a personality. So that is his value for them.”

To be like that, you should know yourself. You should understand yourself. You will feel so proud of yourself. Sometimes people say: “Mother, what have we done to achieve all this? It is so important.” You are humans. This is for humans. All across the world. THen why not for you. Again, there have been so many saints in Maharashtra. They must be feeling such sorrow in their hearts, that why don't people here in Maharashtra not understand this. Why doesn't it progress? So Sahaja Yoga should be spread. This is the main thing I want to tell you about today. I have a speech every year. I tell you everything there is to say about the Kundalini. Even so, and even though I live here in Maharashtra, and speak Marathi.. There is such a depth for spirituality in Marathi. The Naathpanthis started their work here and only then went on to Russia and all the other places around the world. Bolivia - even in that part of the world they went - Machindra Nath and Gorakhnath. And you are all sitting here doing nothing. The two of them went there and spoke of Sahaja Yoga. So when Sahaja Yogis went there now, they were told: “We already knew about Chakras. We know everything.” Who told them? “Two of them had come - Bairaagi (ascetics). And what did they do? They gave us all the knowledge. But we cannot give awakenings to others.” I think I'll send them to Maharashtra. Send them all to give realisation. And that is actually being arranged. So you should all go and give realisation to others. This is your objective. This is why you were born in Maharashtra. You should understand this. You should have a longing for this. I am going to give you realisation today because of the virtue of this land that you are sitting on today. It is so difficult for me in England. But here.. The land itself is so pure. So I don't understand what I should do now. 

Now everyone here today, who makes up their mind and takes a vow to spread Sahaja Yoga, and give everyone realisation, only their Kundalini will get awakened. Sometimes one has to be a bit adamant. So look at yourself with love. Don’t just cry. There should be a steadfastness about oneself. There should be a thought about one's own self that if we are getting this, there has to be a reason why we are getting it. The transformation of the world is sitting on our shoulders. You should understand this, and you can do this. I know that once it starts in Maharashtra, then it wont stop. Sometimes people say to me that people get overwhelmed because of my sweetness; so it might be better to wield the sword sometimes like Shivaji. Now.. There is no need for a sword here. But I should say that I don't even have a reason to call myself Maharashtrian, because I cannot understand what is going on. Even if each of you sitting here go and speak to 100 people, then you have already spoken to all of Maharashtra. You will have worked it out in all of Maharashtra. You should understand that this power is one of the people. Nothing will work out unless this is done. They talk of Democracy. Look at the people, what sort of democracy is this? If they give votes for 5 rupees, then what sort of democracy is this? Is this the real democracy? Give someone 5 rupees, and there he will go to cast his vote. What sort of democracy is this?

So first you have to look at the values of a person. Obtain a special personality. There will be a line up of great personalities that will get created out of this. I am sure of this. But you should let go of two things. First, this ritualism, and secondly, this intellect. Arguments... one panditji is sitting here; another there. Do they actually have a recognition of anyone? Sitting and arguing amongst each other. Today a discussion here, tomorrow there. This is of no use.

How can you have a discussion of something that is singular (one and only)? Hence, firstly obtain that thing which is singular. It is not very difficult for you. Your tradition is so big. So deep, so you just have to get it and you can get it. So with a lot of love, I invite each of and everyone of you to this program of the awakening of the Kundalini. We will do it now. It doesn't take any time. This land that you are sitting on is helping me. And this is your own tradition. It wont take any time. So sit comfortably. You will all have your awakening within 10 minutes. Now put both your hands towards me like this. You should take off your footwear.

[In Hindi]

Please remove your footwear, and put both your hands like this.

[Marathi]

Straight and a little elevated. Now keep the right palm forward, and put your left palm over the fontanel bone area. Up.

[Hindi]

Take it up, not on the surface, but raised. Now left hand towards me. And right hand on the scalp.

[Marathi]

And close your eyes. Is there something cool or hot coming from your hands or from your head? Raise it up and down a bit. It might even be hot. Now again, the right hand towards me.

[Hindi]

Again, right hand towards me and the left hand over the head. And move it around to see whether you can feel any hot or cool breeze coming from your fontanel area.

[Marathi]

Now put both your hands towards me. There is a cold breeze coming towards me from you all. Now all those who had a hot or cool breeze in their palms, their fingers or from their head, they should raise both their hands.

[Hindi]

Everyone who had some hot or cool breeze in their palms, fingers or their head, please raise both your hands. Now see - all of you are awakened. Believe it. You are all awakened. You have had the experience of self realisation. All of you should believe it.

[Marathi]

Believe it. Believe in yourself. My greetings to all of you.

[Hindi]

My namaskar to all of you.

[Marathi]

All of them got it. It's a wonder.
