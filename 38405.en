What is the responsibility that is what we do he said I have been to the regent I think they are very goodbye zebra because I have met him? Another one is Krishna you are all condition if you say so don’t you do that it is the condition you must become independent, I would do nothing you will do it on your own and you will you won't you won't do this Krishna Mukti's disciples are more conditioned than anybody else. I have not been able to give to even one realisation to even one person not even one disciple because he says don't get this condition you should not get conditioned so they get double conditioner so he said I can speak like Krishna this fellow tells me very interesting lines new lines is about 30 years of age. I can't speak like him I can be a better writer than him that the Krishna Murthy I speak the truth and I know all his books by heart and I can talk to people as don't do this and don't do that and so on and here I am sick and I am not well my voice is going down and I don't know what to do with myself to stop this is not transformation I cannot speak well so now do I how do I explain so I told him what do I say what do you say about it he said now I realised that I did that kriya yoga I did kriya Yog.  I was conditioned It condition my one side and when I came to the other side I started conditioning the other side now what happened you start doing something extreme you start moving to right or to the left for example you want to become a very good Saint sanyasi don't get married don't look at women not eat much just eat to leaves in the morning and two lives in the afternoon all this kind of things then what will happen to start moving on to right hand side left to party you become adjoint absolutely imbalanced you go to the extreme sometimes one in million you know my mother feels full stop this mad boy you have taken your realisation you will go too far alright get it so one of them might get the realisation 1 if there is long if there is some love left in them they are horrid very hot tempered to watch hot all these kinds of things now this fellow is it Mataji this side I am caught up here this way and this side I am got up that way what will you do he only realises. he tries his kundalini it goes up and Dharam it comes down to Agnya and then again now five years he is coming to me, five years and this is Mr. Lahiri Baba and his disciple Yoga, Now see for yourself. What will you say? now you see for yourself (some Sahajayogi is talking to Shri Mataji about a lady then told me, she told us) Shrimataji speaking. she never told me when she came. When she came, she was crying there is a permanent headache and heart fail every sort of thing.

That is the best get organization you must go to some go to someone near somebody like Shivpuri Baba that is that something about someone's group then he will start fighting with you and I are going so I said let her suffer for a y let her feel it and then she will realize very difficult you know it is very difficult they are all identified very much to that now she has suffered so much that he is now she is married she says when I put my head on your feet and I feel Ice on my head. I felt that I will die of ice.  what about the one who sang that song. one better than the other this is the Maharaj has written about me. many maharajas know about it. He was announcing about me. then he has come to see me.

This Ratangarh Maharaj was the one who joined back. He is a realized soul no doubt. But he takes everyone to task to a great extent you know. Once he said Mataji if someone troubles you, you please tell us. One person was very troublesome, very troublesome, he tried all my patience, one day I told him Why don’t you go and see maharaja, he was very elated said Oh Maharaja has called. One has to climb seven miles so he went there. He is remembering me. So he went there.  After one month I saw this man, he came to my program He was sitting down there with many people sitting down. Both his legs in his neck and oh. I asked him what have you done why are you sitting like this? You had gone to see Maharaj, I didn’t mean this I said what have you done? He started crying, I said come to my house and tell me what happened? He came to my house and told me that I had gone to see Maharaj and said he was very good. He said yes Mataji very good I sent you to come along have some food and order. He lives in a cave on the top of a hill, and he goes about on a tiger, his legs have become like this as he stays in water so they had become like t what do you call it; Spongy So in the night the tiger came and threw him inside a trench- into a KHAD, this fellow was lying there for three days. He thought the tiger has done this but this was done by Maharaj himself. He said three days I was lying there, I had to go to the bathroom there and everything there, he couldn’t go out. He couldn’t move out, both legs were finished, he could not move. And the fourth day I mean look at the cruelty he threw some bread. He tied them there and he tied some bread -chapati with a string and hanged it came down and he said from there, now eat them and think of your mother & say all the time that I am not going to trouble you anymore. He gave that food and again after two more days of starvation gave a little food. After 5-6 days of all this, he brought him out, and then he said now you will put your legs around your neck go hanging to your mother. She is the one who is going to pardon you, not me. Now don’t trouble her or anyone anymore, otherwise your neck I am going to make it the same way. I am laughing now but that time I was really I was crying. He said mother whatever trouble I gave to you, please forgive me. I made a great mistake. You should have corrected me yourself. Why did you send me to Maharaja? I said you ran to him yourself like anything.

That’s how it is.

He did right and left to all Sahajayogis. He sits with a big stick in his hands. HAA he used to hit. That’s another one Bhutnath baba no no no...there’s another one (Shri Mataji thinks...) He also sits in Himalayas

* He came down. His disciple is Jagan Nath baba and this Jagan Nath baba told one of my disciples. There is a small place near Bombay- a village where this girl lived. He said, “you are Mataji’s disciple, I must go and see her”. She said- “How do you know I am Mataji’s disciple and where is your guru?”. He is sitting in the Himalayas; Ah Amarnath, he said Amarnath” And this Baba has told me to go and see Mataji. She said,” Why don’t you go and see her in Bombay?” He said you call her here and She can come here and When she comes here, we can have a nice program here in our Ashram. So, I could not go there, somehow, I could not visit their Ashram- Ambarnath was the name of the place. After a year or so I went there. So, she said the other fellow has also arrived, the Guru has also arrived. He was waiting for me to come down, he touched my feet. So, I asked me how are you, how are you keeping now, this Jagannath baba gave him a thdak, have you got no shame, where are you sitting now? I said “What’s going on?” He said “Sorry I am sorry”. I said why is it how is it, why do you remember me, I asked this Jagan Nath baba, he said my Guru is also here. I must tell you; I have this Agnya Chakra and my guru told me that after 12 years Mataji will come to Ambarnath and clear you Agnya Chakra and I am not going to clear. I asked him why didn’t you clear his Agnya, you waited for me to come and clear his Agnya, why didn’t you clear his Agnya. He said I am not a mother to spoil them. I worked for thousands of years and I want him to work. Why should I clear his Agnya, let him work out himself? He wants to smoke in your presence. I will kick him you go away from here. I will kick him. He was so frightened. I tell you he ran after me and I removed his Agnya, he was cured. He said Mataji better take me away. I will not smoke I will never smoke in my life you please ask my Guru not to beat me. He was a realized soul; he has an ashram there but this baba he did not clear. He says you are a mother; you spoil them I don’t. He said he kicks me if my nabhi catches, he kicks on my nabhi, that’s the way you all are going to be alright. (Shri Mataji laughs). They are the real ones. Janata was my father and he had a guru from Kandhar, twelve thousand years back. When Nachiketa came to see him, he said you came here as Nanak yourself and Janata was the same as Mohammed Sahab, he said no, I can’t give you self-knowledge. You can ask He made him sleep in a room where there was a sword hanging on his head all night. The poor man could not sleep the whole night. I said why did you let him sleep like that. He said why do you let him sleep like that. He said " Let him try”, If he can sleep like that then he can go to the second room where I have put a lion there. He will have to see the lion the whole night. And only then he can get the knowledge. They tested your courage they tested your everything.  Nobody would listen to you. This Maharaj is Maharaj, You must have seen this Gangan garh Maharaj , he throws people down there like that, doesn’t listen to anyone.

A Sahajayogini asks mother- “How is it possible?

When God is love, how can they do things like that to people when they are realized”.  God is love. They do it in love only.  Mother if a person is in love he will not do it”

It is a very very cool love, I should say.

Mother says “People need that love sometimes really very much Sahajayogini “Yaa”. “They really need it very much sometimes. Their One thing is better”. He says if he has this cane all the bhoots will run away. Ah, you think so! They are not allowed to surround you.

Ohh! I see. Ya. You see. That is why we have to start to take the hunter. There are so many of them like that. These are so horrible. Ohh. If somebody is so horrible. If I do anything to him, he will go away. I know that. Not to him but the other fellow but she will trouble him there. That’s why I am doing it slowly. But they have no patience, there is no cruelty. It’s the love.

A Sahaja yogini asks” Mother, is it possible that a realized soul can make a mistake?”

Shri Mataji -Of course They do, they are human beings, after all, they are not incarnations. For example, if he did not want to come down and say, I will come after twelve years then what I would have said to him. I am going to bottle you here. He is already 108 years of age. He will come down after 12 years. After twelve years what is he going to do when I have to do the work.

They think they have done the work & have achieved a lot.  You are named in the pattern of Ganesh. They cannot raise your Kundalini the way you can. They cannot feel the vibrations the way you can feel. You are in a way higher than them; you have achieved something higher than them in a way. You will be surprised. You are very special ones. I am also something very special to someone, who are they to stop.  They are very egoistic a lot, I think. Gagangarh Maharaj when once I was going to see him, it was raining very heavily and he controls the rain. The rain was coming heavily when I reached there, he came before me, test fighting the rain on me like that. I was all drenched.  He came up. He said, “You have to take care of my ego”. I said “How?” He said Rain listens to me or not to me. It was raining heavily you got drenched. He was very upset. He said, “I made a mistake”.  I am angry because the rain misbehaved to such a limit that it has drenched my mother. You see I had to counterbalance his ego. He thought that my power has been challenged. I told him in the sweetest manner I said see listen to me, you had bought a saree for me, how are you going to give it to me. Now my saree is all drenched I have no excuses than to take it, that’s why I allowed it to rain. All his anger went away in a moment. All his anger went away.

He said there must be more point to that also. I said Yes there is. I said while I was coming water was falling on me and then water is flowing into mother earth. Thus, the vibrations are falling and entering mother earth, now we will have a beautiful scenery here when the water goes inside mother earth which is vibrated. It is you see. What it goes. What is going from me after all, the water is falling on me. What does it matter to me? Why do you feel so bad about it? No mother I am sorry about it. That’s how they are. These people are like that. They make mistakes and then they don’t accept them as they are so egoistic.

Then why should you get who are you? What have you done; you are standing on our heads for thirty thousand years? Why did you have to You should not have? Who asked you? We are not married, we have no children, we have given up everything. What is there to give up?  Why did you give up? Who told you to do it? I eat two leaves in the morning. I said You eat everything. Why do you eat two leaves? God has given you everything Then you have an obligation on me you ask me these people are married, why are you giving them realization.

They are silly, you see. You mean they are within themselves. They have to be awakened.

Another one is Yamduta only, he has no patience. Gets angry very much. Sometimes it is better for a while. I mean yesterday in the morning you know. Let it be for some time, doesn’t matter. It is alright. It’s a state of the subconscious. You should never have tested these people you know. In most of the people in the west, it sets in.  As if you see you have jumped into the sea from the boat or you have passed through the traffic. And you have put on the hill. Still, you can feel the traffic. Like inertia. It is still working. Don’t you worry about the future or the past? Human beings are human beings! Nothing harsh should be done. And no operations should be done of that kind. If you know your body or your emotions. Apart from the worst thing in modern times is that people are very egoistic. You see it is a very ego-oriented society. You say anything immediately the ego is touched to you; you do anything ego is touched to you. Then with you is the superego. You are touched by these people. So, they give you ideas. I say something an idea comes to your mind. I say something a doubt comes on the other side, so there is a struggle going on. You too. You too have that problem. Or no. You don’t have the argument against me now inside you. Is there an argument going on, something inside?  Yes, sometimes I see in the dark, I feel. But you don’t feel as such. You don’t feel it as a big argument against it. It is not a big argument. But that he is getting an argument in himself. You may get it. But they are going to do it because they don’t want you to be easy. It is not easy. You play with them. They don’t want it to be easy. To such an extent it is. A gentleman from Latin. He was much more than what you are. He had spirits and things like that He was vomiting and wanted to come and see me. He could not. They brought him halfway he got down and said I have to go to the bathroom. So, he got down and ran away towards the other side. All sorts of people could not get have it. Now he is all right. He is a Sahaja yogi now. But the pressure is too much They would say “Get Up” and Get Up” and so on. You have to prepare yourself. You have to say them to get up, then they would start seeing things you have to see them coming. You can see that even in the sunlight there are black spots. I see white spots. You see white spots are better. But if you see black spots. If you close your eyes, and see a black spot then its miracle. White spots are good. Good source. Still, you bother about them if you see it faint it’s a plain but if you see a white spot, you should consider it is not a bad thing.  have nothing to do with dead. But if you see a black spot, black spots are the worse type, they are worse type and do not leave easily. They are horrible. Talks. Just laugh at it. That’s the best thing to laugh. Don’t not make much ado of it. Its something which is nothing important. Let it go. Useless things. First of all, all your psychic power will go. Everything will go. In India we had many like that. But in England I think we have so many of them so many of them sitting there at every corner. One person is sitting here and another one is sitting down there. One scription is sitting down here under the name of some body is sitting down here, so many of them. It is shameful.  Christ was one who denounced his name through-out. Even get calling the Christians as decostrous. Hain! Christian is Church, Christian is Church. On this video, they start with Hu Hu Hu. Is this the way God coming to you? How can God come to Hu Hu Hu. In India all the place God stays.  God has no other place to go to.  Anything extraordinary happens you put it to God. It’s wrong. Haa. They are all within me, whatever you have. You don’t worry at all, alright! Drugs are biggest tragedy. Drugs, you took drugs also. You could not have taken more. Druggist and chemist, Druggist and chemist if you wash off their stomach, you can start a drug company. You know when you were new to Sahajayoga and I said you have to stop taking these drugs and you got angry with me. Then you got yourself into again problem, you were jaundiced also so much so that you were almost dying. We didn’t know what to do. You didn’t realise. Now you have realized but if we wash your stomach, we may get some drug for smuggling. A Sahajayogini asks “Mataji do you know of Swami Chaitanya Nand Sarawati?” “NO" I don’t understand you. I get Zero marks, Zero Hai. There is one incarnation, Ratan Garh Maharaj. Then not this one. Another one is there who is taking out something from fire, diamonds. He is a well-known Rakshasa. He looks like a buffalo. His skin is like buffalo and spikes look ugly. Very ugly. This one Sai baba Satya Sai Baba, Sai baba the original one was Mohammad Sahab himself but this horrible fellow Satya Sai baba. People call him Satya Sai baba; they don’t even think. If you think you can rationalise. All of them can rationalize. All of them you can rationalize. For example, take now this Satya Sai baba what does he do, he carries this thing from here to here. Now think what is there in interest of God for carrying one thing from here to here. Haven’t you got hands to do that. Why would God carry this thing from here to here? Think into diamonds he will give it to rich man. If he wants such a river, why won’t he do it from Olark Orsk from such a country so beautiful. Why don’t we think about it? And what is the interest of God in giving these stones. If he has to give, he will give something to drink. People think that he is God, Absolutely brainless people. Think about all of them. Those who talk that they are they. You tell me, all of them talk about this, they are one better than other.   It is in this book, did not get time to read it so much rubbish is written here. This is about this Shivpuri Baba. He talks in a way that seems to be good. Not in a rationalised way. Seems he talks about his experience and talks about vardan and does not look like he has got it from one book and put it in another book. Now actually What it is okay as far as vibrations are concerned. That’s a different one. It’s a book. Let us rationalise it like this. Let us read it No no. More practical. Let us rationalise it. Rationalize it, use your brains. First use your brains through wisdom. And then you understand. You tell your mind it is all Humber.  It is your mind, come on. If you start in a way that you understand that you a separate rider. It will make you jump. If you go to this it will make you go that side, if you take you this side that side. It will never take you to the right path. You will know if you are wise. Keep your mind straight and think it over. Is it what God? What is there that God has. What is special written about God. given you, what is so special. There is, it seems to be a special book. All other books seem rubbish but this one seems good.  But what it is rubbish. What I am saying is that it is so horrible, I can’t tell you. (A Sahajayogi talks about the vibrations) Vibrations are another sort of conditionings. I can see you’re a bit. It is not conditionings that also can be rationalised. It is very easy. That also gets rationalised. You put ten children who are in a path way like clock. They will say the same thing, all of them, and if you tally it on the person he will say. If they say his so and so is catching Must be liver. Has to be liver. But when I ask this person, he will say yes, my liver is bad. But when they give you vibrations your liver is cured. But by conditioning you don’t cure people. But ten children sitting down there, say the same thing. That’s how they find it. Then you do it yourself.  If by conditioning you can give them a feeling of thoughtless awareness, collective consciousness. Sitting down there, no. Where is your chakra catching? All of them saying the same thing. No questions. We are not paying for it. If it is conditioning, how can all of them say the same thing. All right even, supposing they are hypnotised sort of set. And they are curing you, raising your Kundalini, you can see with your naked eyes. still, you are not going to believe. This is going too far. This nonsense you are never see him, feeling so much for him, you are talking so much about him. Now see what is the mind doing to you. The man you are never going to meet, you have never known, who is rubbish, why are you taking his side. Rationality. Now see what is the mind. This is not helping. It is not being sensible. Where is he taking you? What is your connection with him.  At the most you can say you are from Russia and he is your Guru, that may be the reason that’s it. It’s too far. At the most you go to the last visit. But I am sitting here for you. I am here. I am going to work it out. You have felt the vibrations. You have the meditation and seen yourself. Go ahead. The more you are going to start irritate, the more you will go backward. This is the only difference between a Sahaja yogi who moves fast and a Sahaja yogi who flocks. But you know you are there. It is what it is. That is what you are finding. You have to settle down here. Kevin has said about testing me and all. But certain points are rationalized, what is mother seeking here. She doesn’t need anything. She doesn’t want anything, nothing. She is doing all this. He has seen himself with naked eyes the Kundalini rising. He has seen becoming thoughtlessly aware. How can he not believe? He has to believe with experience. You see that’s what I am saying. You see by this thing you do not becoming Nothing. You have to become. Unless and until you believe into becoming these things are going to keep you away because they will make you very superficial. Because they will make you anything, what will happen, you will be reading them. You will be doing this; you will be doing that. It is not doing; it is becoming I am talking about. It is the actualization I am talking about. The one who gives you actualisation, you go to them. But not to ones who just leads things, he is misleading. You know he is misleading. You know your search is not going into right direction. You must ask for becoming. You become You have to be that. That’s what it is. Its only talking, talking, talking, talking. Like I would say that, people just first started talking about the flowers because they want you to have the hunch.so they say lets talk about flowers. People will just be talking, talking, talking about flowers, flowers, flowers. What happens now they talk to this, talk to that about flowers. So he said everybody is talking about flowers, lets talk about the leaves. Mohammed Saheb thought about that, there are so many of them talk about abstract form. They started talking So, what happens people talk, talk, talk, all the time because whenever they talk, they become talking about. No body became that. Nobody became a being. You have to become that. Unless and until you become that nothing is possible. It is becoming and these things are you cannot become by reading how can you become. You need to say because you can read it. Oh! no, I realize that. Actually, you are being judgemental but rationally you understand children for example, do not read. A person who is uneducated cannot read, if he cannot read, he cannot get caught. If it is your self phenomena, then. Ah hello. That’s my girlfriend. She is very nice. Her sister is also very good. (Russian name). What’s your name? Mandy. Mand sit here Mandy. She comes from a loving family. You must teach him how to love. Ah! I will teach him. Too much reading also makes a person non-loving. You cannot read about love. Language of love cannot be read. Ha, you want to read, after realization, not before I would say. You won’t understand. Khalifa Gibran. Read something sensible. What’s this. From this side it looks like a monkey. How did he die. He said he died. Hundred and thirty-eight, that’s the book says. So, what there are people in India who are of that age. Why was he living a life like that? But you haven’t got this book. Book has been bought to you by Lith Hardvick, but after some time you cannot bear with him. We have one Sahaja Yogi, he drowned so much in these, so many of them. Just went through them. Her sister is good too. You haven’t got it from anywhere, Alright, so you better stick on to it. If so, many children are travelling in a boat and they are all connected by heart. Rather jump at. Its mad, mad, mad. Oh! She is good. She is a good girl. Better now for everyone of us. You are lighter. You are cool inside. Its quiet distinctive. More inside. Gradually fine all your doubts are cleared. When he starts, nothing is hypothetical. It seems left heart. Already arthritis. Neem Kauri Baba, which? Neem Kauri baba have you heard of him? His disciple came to my program. Baba RamDas? No, no, not baba Ramdas this is another one. I came to know because of his disciple, otherwise how would I know? This person came to see me, led by a very sensible man. He came to learn Sahajayoga and said she is a doctor of a friend of mine and really worried. So I asked her to come along to check her vibration. Actually, first I was giving lecture and she was sitting in the first row and she was doing like this. I said What is this, and asked what is she doing? Then I asked this man where did you get her from? And he said such and such place. I said She had very hot vibrations. She said No, I went to Neem Karoli Baba. I am his disciple. Such a brainless girl, she said he gave me his own water. I said what does it mean. She said water that he makes. Water that he makes, she said urine. She drank the urine of that Neem Karoli baba. Now she was boasting out. When I told her, she was shaking like anything? You cannot see that; you are getting into trouble. She was smoking also. I think You love him a lot. I also love him. Don’t worry. So attached to him. Now she feels sorry. Germans are very good in vibrations; Russians are also good. In Russia at least there is fear, but what is this peck your eyes peck your ears, peck your nose.

What's this freedom also, it couldn't protect the nose, your eyes, your ears; this is no freedom. Russians are suppressed very much, but they are innocent people. Here what has happened in lots of families, what you call the wounded soldiers.

You won't believe I have been here for four years; I didn't have a public program.  I didn't have a public meeting, Only the first public meeting I have ever had.

Sahaj yogi- Mataji she has pains and gets rashes on her fingers, it comes after anxiety, worry

Shri Mataji- these are blisters, now they are much better, you see your) this pain see now, isn't it too, just see for yourself. She is so pale.

Marie was Baap Re Baap , Marie was absolutely.. she was, god knows where she was. I couldn't talk to her. I mean she was talking, i thought she was talking from some well, and i just couldn't hear her, absolutely, she was dying, you know, dying absolutely dying

Sahaj yogi- Oh when, when Maria came to India, this young chap in a suit came out said ma’am can I carry your bag. She said no thanks, I am meeting my friends.

Sahaj yogini- i didn't recognize him, oh no Douglas, I didn't recognize him,

Sahaj yogi- He was in his best suit

Sahaj yogini- she saw him at the stage and the meeting and you know i knew i knew this fellow but didn't know from where?

It is liver.

A woman - is it possible to have somebody which is not there, which we cannot reach at the moment, a relation. I would like to do it.

Shri Mataji- who is that?

women - It’s my sister of my mother, an aunt of mine, which I like, but she is very bad.

Shri Mataji- where is she?

Woman-She is now in Justin in Germany, in the west but she has to go back.

Shri Mataji- what's wrong with her

woman - she gets very frightened in her mind, she always thinks everybody is spying her. These years in east part has quiet disturbed her.  She has very disturbed by living in the eastern part. She has always been afraid, afraid, afraid. I feel she has really got certain part of the brain which have slightly disturbed and really I would like to help her. But just now don’t worry. Just now I want you to be all right. Just now you forget.

(All laughing)

Oh! Who is this one?  This is the worst of all I have ever had. Oh! Gous Where is Gous?  That one. Oh shame shame.

He is he is a journalist. Here.

Who is this guy? She is one of the clan. She is one of the most dissolute female, I have ever met. She is in terrible state. Even this Christine. She was actually going to the lunatic asylum, when she came to me.

Are you feeling better? Is your sister married or not? What part of the country? Austalia, East Coast.  Which part? I have been to Queensland border. Queensland Border. This is where you actually go? All right. Put a Bandhan to yourself, so that you don’t your off your vibrations. Hmm. Do like that. Lighter? Lighter? This is the worst instruction I would like. Watch out. You have to cover your aura, put a Bandhan. Attention is better. Say the mantra, put your hands towards me. Hmm alright? Yaa Better? How are you feeling? Haa How are you feeling? Better. Better?

1:00:00

Lots of black is still coming out of your chakras. Today I used these small cans. Are you better now? I don’t need these small cans. Now, Are you alright? Yesterday you got caught from another boy that Italian. You were alright yesterday, then again you put your attention on that Italian boy too much. Alex, No. Alex? Hmm. She knows very well. I am very innocent. She found me Gurus misbehaving with his girlfriend where She denounced her mundane sort of done something with her, doubling from something. He is very upset.

On left like that like that. Yes, yes. So, you become separate from others. You see vibrations. This is your aura your personal aura, you are giving it a bandhan. I think I got it from him, I was sitting here. Now how is it?  You usually can get it as you sort of identify. Now how is it all right now? Yes. Lost? Ya lost. Go from here. Just see. See now. These gurus never allow you to touch them. If you touch them, they will faint. They will be short-circuited. Are you alright? Are you feeling vibrations? Are you feeling any cool breeze. Did you give bandhan to yourself. Seven time. Again bring it back. All right. Right now? Haa. Better now. Throw away all these things which are not constructive.
