Another one is Krishna you are all condition if you say so don't don't you do that it is the condition you must become independent I would do nothing you will do it on your own and you will you won't you won't do this Krishna Mukti's disciples are more conditioned than anybody else. I have not been able to give to even one realisation to even one person not even one disciple because he says don't get this condition you should not get conditioned so they get double conditioner so he said I can speak like Krishna this fellow tells me very interesting lines new lines is about 30 years of age isase I can't speak like him I can be a better writer than him that the Krishna Murthy I speak the truth and I know all his books by heart and I can talk to people as don't do this and don't do that and so on and here I am sick and I am not well my voice is going down and I don't know what to do with myself to stop this is not transformation I cannot speak well so now do I how do I explain so I told him what do I say what do you say about it he said now I realised that I did that kriya yoga I did kriya Yog I was conditioned I condition my one side and when I came to the other side I started conditioning and other side now what happened you start doing something extreme you start moving to right or to the left for example you want to become a very good Saint sanyasi don't get married don't look at women not eat much just eat to leaves in the morning and two lives in the afternoon all this kind of things then what will happen to start moving on to right hand side left to party you become adjoint absolutely imbalanced you go to the extreme sometimes one in million you know my mother feels full stop this mad boy you have taken your realisation you will go too far alright get it so one of them might get the realisation 1 if there is long if there is some love left in them they are horrid very hot tempered to watch hot all these kinds of things now this fellow is it Mataji this side I am caught up here this way and this side I am got up that way what will you do he only realises. he tries his kundalini it goes up and Dharam it comes down to Agnya and then again now five years he is coming to me, five years and this is Mr. Lahiri Baba and his disciple Yoga, Now see for yourself. What will you say? now you see for yourself (some Sahajayogi is talking to Shri Mataji about a lady then told me, she told us)Shrimataji speaking.. she never told me when she came. When she came she was crying there is a permanent headache and heart fail every sort of thing.

That is the best get organization you must go to some go to someone near somebody like Shivpuri Baba that is that something about someone's group then he will start fighting with you and I are going so I said let her suffer for a y let her feel it and then she will realize very difficult you know it is very difficult they are all identified very much to that now she has suffered so much that he is now she is married she says when I put my head on your feet and I feel Ice on my head. I felt that I will die of ice. what about the one who sang that song. one better than the other this is the Maharaj has written about me. many maharajas know about it. He was announcing about me. then he has come to see me.

This Ratangarh Maharaj was the one who joined back. He is a realized soul no doubt. But he takes everyone to task to a great extent you know. Once he said Mataji if someone troubles you, you please tell us. One person was very troublesome, very troublesome, he tried all my patience, one day I told him Why don’t you go and see maharaja, he was very elated said Oh Maharaja has called. One has to climb seven miles so he went there. He is remembering me. So he went there. After one month I saw this man, he came to my program He was sitting down there with many people sitting down. Both his legs in his neck and oh. I asked him what have you done why are you sitting like this? You had gone to see Maharaj, I didn’t mean this I said what have you done? He started crying, I said come to my house and tell me what happened? He came to my house and told me that I had gone to see Maharaj and said he was very good. He said yes Mataji very good I sent you to come along have some food and order. He lives in a cave on the top of a hill, and he goes about on a tiger, his legs have become like this as he stays in water so they had become like t what do you call it; Spongy So in the night the tiger came and threw him inside a trench- into a KHAD, this fellow was lying there for three days. He thought the tiger has done this but this was done by Maharaj himself. He said three days I was lying there, I had to go to the bathroom there and everything there, he couldn’t go out. He couldn’t move out, both legs were finished, he could not move. And the fourth day I mean look at the cruelty he threw some bread. He tied them there and he tied some bread -chapati with a string and hanged it came down and he said from there, now eat them and think of your mother & say all the time that I am not going to trouble you anymore. He gave that food and again after two more days of starvation gave a little food. After 5-6 days of all this, he brought him out, and then he said now you will put your legs around your neck go hanging to your mother. She is the one who is going to pardon you, not me. Now don’t trouble her or anyone anymore, otherwise your neck I am going to make it the same way. I am laughing now but that time I was really I was crying. He said mother whatever trouble I gave to you, please forgive me. I made a great mistake. You should have corrected me yourself. Why did you send me to Maharaja? I said you ran to him yourself like anything.

That’s how it is.

He did right and left to all Sahajayogis. He sits with a big stick in his hands. HAA he used to hit. That’s another one Bhutnath baba no no no...there’s another one(Shri Mataji thinks...) He also sits in Himalayas
