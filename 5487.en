Spirit, Attention, Mind - Finchley ashram, London (UK), 1978.

As I've said now Christine had asked me “What is our surrendering?” And he has asked me if we have a free will or not. Alright?

You have a free will of your own. Especially human beings have it, not the animals. You have the free will to choose good and bad, righteous and unrighteousness. Now, you can choose to surrender, or not to surrender to the Spirit: to be dominated by your own will.

Now she asked me, “What is the surrender?”

Surrendering, as I am saying, that is to be done in three stages.

Especially here in this country where people think, rationalise, analyse. Because it’s not easy. If you can do it otherwise, you can do [it] automatically. Supposing God, Himself, is sort of based according to your certain conceptions. I don’t know what sort of conceptions you have towards God, but supposing your certain conceptions, individual [conceptions]. Everyone has individual conceptions for God. And maybe that you feel that He is Almighty and He’s so great; you just bow to Him without thinking. But that cannot be.

So the first point is to surrender by understanding rationally. Nobody is unconscious, nobody is in the subconscious. You are all very conscious as to what you are doing and what’s happening to you. So when you see that, “the Divine Force is flowing through me, it is coming out as vibrations, it is working out,” [that] you can also manoeuvre it, then rationally you must know the Will of that Divine Power which is flowing. Because your will is still not up to that Will of vibrations.

Still, when you rationalise things, you may not be doing the same thing as the vibrations will be wanting. To begin with, I am saying. Now you want to go to the right, but suppose you have to go to the left - for what? For a gain, for your evolution, for your more understanding of the Divine, for the dissolution of your ego.

Now ego and your will are two different things. This is the point I think, perhaps, that is bothering you.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: You have reached that point now.

Ego and your will is to be found out. How? By finding out your Self.

Now, what is your Self? Is the Spirit within you. Alright?

How do you know your Self? Because, after realisation, It vibrates and It tells you. So your will becomes the will of your Spirit, not of your ego; because you have also superego. And with ego you have done mistakes, you have achieved no evolution.  You have achieved nothing through your ego. But don’t trust your ego, don’t challenge it, don’t over power it. But you replace it by the will of your Self. That’s a part within you.

The more you start learning about vibrations, learning what they are saying to you, how they teach you, you will learn about your Self. For example, a child uses his hands first of all, he puts the hand on the hot plate and sees it’s hot, then on the cold plate and sees it’s cold: trial and error. He learns what is correct, what is incorrect, what is what. Actually [he learns] what is the reality. Actually in hot and cold there’s nothing like ‘bad’ and ‘wrong’ but it’s the reality that: this is hot, that burns your hand; cold that freezes you.

In the same way, when you start using vibrations, you start learning about your Self. That’s the first time you are using your Self, because that Self is so far not known to you.

So, the free will to know your Self is there. If you don’t want to know, nobody is going to force you. This free will has to be achieved yourself.

Within your Self this free will is active through your egoless Self, but not as ego but [as] the complete pre-conscious mind. There is a difference between the complete pre-conscious mind and the ego.  This differentiation must be brought in then you will know what is free will and what is ego.

Your pre-conscious mind is on the right hand side and [is] the complete right hand side channel, starting from your ego, up to the Mooladhara. The complete channel is the pre-conscious mind that you call as the ‘mana’ in the Sanskrit language. This pre-conscious mind is the horse. Now you also guide that horse.

Now the part that guides that horse is which part? Is that which guides even that horse. Is it the ego or the whole thing? So we should say that ego is known as ahamkara - is the complete thing. And the ‘aham’ part, the ‘I-ness’, that is…I don’t know in English what do you call that? The one, that ‘I’, that does it. It operates this ego. We can say that is the shadow of Self within you. Or we can [say] there is someone who is all the time seeing you. You are not connected with the Self but you know the dictums of the Self. There’s somebody who’s watching all the time. We can say the shadow of that, which is spread in our being, of the Self, is that. We know what that wants. When we are committing mistakes, we know we are committing mistakes. If we are thieving, we know we are thieving. That Light is all the time there. That is the Self Itself.  We know that it is there but there is no other side of what is touched. That is, you see the projection of that in you, but you cannot reach from where the projection is coming.

That’s [the] One known as Kshetragya. Is the one who knows the field, the Knower of the field. Actually it is the Self Itself. But His vision in us, the vision of that - you can call, that’s what I call is the shadow - the vision of that Self we are all the time conscious of. It is watching us even when we are alone, when we are in company and everywhere - It is watching us.  This One, in the [Bhagavad] Gita, is called as Kshetragya. ‘Kshetra’ is the field, and the One is the Knower of the field [is Kshetragya].

Actually the Knower is the Self but through its vision, through its power of knowledge it is knowing everything and we know that It is there. ‘We’ that means the ego part. The ego knows that somebody is watching it.

In Sahaja Yoga, everything, what happens [is] that that vision that you have throughout becomes the vibrations: in the sense that you can have a rapport with that point from where it has manifested. Did you follow me? If you have not you tell me.

Like this is the (electric) light, alright? This light has an aura or it has a light spread out of itself. What do you call that light which is spreading out, apart from the light that is there? I’ll just call it the shadow, alright? Alright?

So the light that is spreading out from there is knowing about what you are doing and you know that shadow force. It’s like a shadow in you. You know in yourself what you are doing. And that is the shadow that carries all your deeds onto, also, your Kundalini and puts that and sits down there. That is what sometimes you call as “human awareness”. That light is the human awareness as you call it. But ego is not the same because It can see the ego, It can see the superego. But, what you say is the ‘I’: the light that is closed in this room, by this candle, or by this (electric) light is what you call the ‘I’ the closed one. And this knows about everything and you know that this Light knows about what you are doing.

This (electric) light does not know. It’s just the opposite, the other way. This light that is inside this room does not know what you are doing but through this light you know what is in this room. Do you follow this point? The light that is spread in the room, that light has no awareness but because of this light we can know what is in this room. Just the opposite is the Light of Self. The Light of Self knows what we are doing and because of that Light we also know what we are doing. If we were unconscious we would not know we are doing.

So that Light, or that aura of that Light, sparks at the conscious moment. Like this, you can say: supposing this is the past and this is the future, in the centre is the conscious mind and in this conscious mind you see the light of the knowledge [of] what you know.

Sahaja yogi: The conscious [mind] is the Self?

Shri Mataji: No, no.  Conscious [mind] is the area in which the Light of the Self makes you aware of what you are. Like the gleam of the light passing through, you can say. From the Self the light has come and it enlightens the conscious mind. And the conscious mind knows, in the conscious area, that Light knows what you are doing. And you are also aware of that Light.

Gregoire: What difference [is there] between the pre-conscious mind and conscious mind in the location?

Shri Mataji: The location is: conscious in the centre and pre-conscious on the right. Alright?  Pre-conscious is on the right and conscious is in the centre.

Now the pre-conscious mind, whatever the pre-conscious mind is doing, we know in the area of the conscious mind. This Light gives us the awareness of it. The Light is the aura of the Self.

Sahaja yogi: It’s like a mirror. The conscious mind is the mirror for the pre-conscious mind.

Shri Mataji: You see when you say ‘mirror’ it becomes one-sided, that’s the point. That’s why I’m saying: It is not one-sided. It is all-sided. If you just use as a mirror, then it has to be one side but it is not like that. It is on all sides. The aura is on all sides. Or you can say it falls onto the edges of the conscious mind, of the pre-conscious mind and the sub-conscious mind, in the centre, in the conscious area. But that’s the Light part. The conscious mind itself has no meaning if we are not aware. The conscious mind can sleep off if you are not aware of the Light. So that Light which is coming to you, the Self becomes Light.

Now human beings have that Light much brighter than the animals have. That’s why I call it a Light. It’s not only the conscious mind, because the animals also have the conscious mind. But your light is different from their light.  Your awareness is much higher and is built up. How? By developing your chakras.

For example, we can say, in the centre is the light, and [if] all the sides are reflecting then you can use the same waves. Or supposing this is the conscious mind, this is also the conscious mind, so the light is in the centre, and the light is reflected on these walls.  Now the conscious mind of the human beings, supposing, are these walls and they are evolved and developed to such a point that they see what wrong they are doing, and they can see for themselves.

If they keep these walls clear and clean, the conscious mind I am saying, that means you are alert about what you are doing with your conscious mind. Then [if] you keep these walls absolutely clean then the reflection is very clear. But still there is no rapport established between the walls and the light, you can say. This way it is, the light knows the walls, walls also know there is a light which knows about it. But the rapport, in the sense that the light cannot do anything about the Self and the Self cannot do about the light. Did you follow that?

But that light exists. It exists. It tells you the reality. It tells you, “This is what you are, here you are. This is your position.” This light is telling you [this]. This is that Kshetragya, the one who knows the field. He just tells you. It makes a clear-cut idea to you that, “You are here. You have got spots on your wall. You have got spoilt your walls. There is no reflection coming,” or, “There is reflection coming,” if you are alright. And the better you are, the better is the light, and there is no conflict coming, or going on. That’s why I said [it’s important] to be in the centre.

Now, you can say that the attention is in the walls. Your attention is spread on the walls. Alright? From there we can say [that] it acts inside and outside. The attention acts outside, as you know, it’s very easy to act outside. But inside it acts only as far as knowing that, “I know everything what I talk” Did you follow that point?

The attention is on the walls, human attention is on the walls. This attention knows that there is a light inside it and it puts that light, as far as possible, outside; [that] also it can extend its light outside. In the sense that, supposing a person who is not realised but he’s a dharmic person, so his light is quite alright, no problem. He doesn’t have any problems he’s dharmic. He’s a nice religious man and he knows there is light. He knows and there is no conflict between the light and himself. So the aura is absolutely nicely put. Or supposing there’s a conflict between this and this: the aura will be disturbed. But actually there is no disturbance in the light itself. But, because of these walls, it may be looking disturbed again. Because, when the light is falling on something: like [if] you see the water, and if the water is not steady, it’s moving – [it’s] like that. Alright? So, like that, the attention is here (on the walls). Attention if it is unsteady, then the image will get this blurred [image] of the light. And the light that you throw out, outside, becomes the blurred image of that light. Alright?

So, now we are coming to the conscious mind.

Conscious mind is the one, in that area which is a very shortened time, very short time, between the future and the past. Is just a little time, very little time. Is called as vilamba, in the Sanskrit language. Is a very, very, very small, little time. And we cannot stop there. So, [in] that area, suddenly you touch the aura, you can say, the light, and there you see. So then you know what it is. Then again you are thinking about the past, or you think about the future. That time, you know what you are thinking, but then you come to the conscious area and you think, “Oh I have been thinking like that I should not think!” because you are moving all the time on waves. In between these two waves is the conscious mind. A little bit, a very little bit is there, in the beginning. Alright?

Now below that is the unconscious mind you can say. Actually it is above but we can say, below, just now, to explain. Like, the wave is rising this way, that way. In between there is a little gap and there, in the conscious mind, you are touching that light of the unconscious mind. So that unconscious mind, what we call as unconscious mind, is that aura of the light of the Self.

So every moment you are conscious, you are conscious of your unconscious mind. Conscious in the sense that you know that the unconscious mind knows, that’s why. It’s really remarkable how it’s made! For example you can say like that: you come up on one wave, you find it’s here, “Oh yes, I know all that what I’m thinking.” Then again you go on thinking, thinking, thinking. Again you come to the conscious mind, “Oh yes, I know what I’m thinking.” The unconscious mind is this. This is the light of the unconscious mind. You can see [that] it feels like a waves. Alright?

Do you follow Bogdan? Try to follow it then it will be nice.

Now questioning you don’t ask. Just now you try to follow because it’s a subtle subject and, if you have to understand the subtle, I have to use analogies which are not subtle. So, in analogies, don’t get lost. I’m just trying to tell you how to understand what is the unconscious mind within us and where do we stand as far as the conscious mind is concerned.

The edge of the unconscious mind is the unconscious; edge of it. And there is the attention also. Now what happens is you are moving, say, your attention. Now attention is moving, say, you can take it, to the future or the past. Now the attention goes like that, and at the conscious mind, suddenly you’ll become aware of it. Your attention becomes aware, “Oh!” otherwise you are just thinking, thinking, thinking like that. But when again you touch at the conscious mind, again you become aware. Again you move like this then you are lost. Again you become conscious. Now this light is coming from where? Is from the Self.

Where is the ego and where is the superego in this? Now this, say, is the past, and this is the future. So, all the time you are moving from past to the future, past to the future, like that. But in this jumping there’s a little time in between where you are conscious of it. And whenever you are moving from one to another - before realisation I am saying, all this I am telling you about before realisation - you are conscious that there is something under flow, which is knowing where, how, we are jumping, whether this or that. You are going this way, that way, this way, that way, all the time forwards, backwards, whatever it is. But you are moving [in] this way.

Now, the movement of the conscious mind you can see, but it’s a split of a second, just a split of a second – before realisation. Did you follow this point or not Dr. Bogdan? Make it very clear or not? So we move on to another point.

Attention is moving which is on the edge. You can say that attention is another light or you can say another sort of a - which is the human side of it which is moving from there – energy. Then the attention is another energy, which is moving like this, on the edge. It is generated from your liver. This energy is generated from your liver, and it comes out. And it is just like a very thin edge, you can say, the attention.

So the attention is recording where are we. But when it touches the conscious mind, it becomes conscious of what you are – “This is me”. Maybe when you are stealing you are not conscious, but when you have stolen, suddenly you come back, “Oh God, I did that!” You become conscious of it. So the attention is moving like this, which makes you aware of that.

Now, the human attention has been evolved at the edge of the pre-conscious and the sub-conscious mind. Do you follow this point or not? On the edges. The human attention.

(Shri Mataji stops the talk to enquire about somebody’s health who has just arrived, in Hindi. She then seems to recap what She has already explained for the benefit of that person.)

This is the unconscious mind here. Alright? And this is the right hand side, is what you call the pre-conscious mind, and this is the sub-conscious mind. The attention is in between, connected with the unconscious mind as you can call it. But this unconscious mind in the angle I have shown it in. Just to show that it’s the unconscious mind I have shown it like that. But actually you know, the unconscious mind is a part of it in the Kundalini and part up there.  So it is, just to show you, I have shown it, saying you can call it the aura of Kundalini you can call it. But now here it is easier to understand, it is very easier to understand from this diagram. Alright?

It is like this, the attention is spread out, throughout. And this area I’ve enlarged it’s not such a big area, I’ve just enlarged it (on the diagram?) This is the area of the conscious mind, which is a very small area, and this part is the ego and the superego is here. And this lining is the conscious mind.

Sahaja Yogi: this is in the head?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no! This is in the human being, the complete form, the complete thing, I’m telling you. The Ida and Pingala. This is the Pingala and this is the Ida. At the edge of that is the unconscious mind (?) and inside it is the conscious mind is put. This is a very small area. Now what happens, that, here is the Kundalini. Alright? That is also the unconscious mind, part of the unconscious mind. And here is the unconscious mind. I have shown you [that] here is the Self. And the Self, Sadashiva’s feet is here. This sees, from here it sees all over and It comes out here, your Spirit comes out, goes round and sees it. It is on your head, resides on your head, also in your heart, and it is watching you around. It knows, it is all the time knowing about you and this light that is here, we are also aware of it, that it is there. We know that this light is recording us, we are aware of it. All the time we are aware that this light is trickling down and there’s a little glimmer of that light coming in, that little gleam of light, you can say, into the conscious mind.

So we are aware that this light is knowing about us. What we do is to, by raising the Kundalini is to….(break in recording)…pushes this out and take this attention into itself. So a rapport is established between the Spirit and your Self. If you can think, if you can make it a small one, the Kundalini a small one, but supposing I had made a big one; so the Kundalini rises, touching the attention like this, all over. Goes up to here, becomes one.

Yogi: because the attention is on the whole Nadi from the Mooladhara up to the bottom it’s not in the mind.

Shri Mataji: What?

Yogi: The attention.

Shri Mataji: No, no. Attention is not in the mind alone, attention is all along, and is generated through your, is generated, I mean it is not generated we should say, but we can say it is looked after or maintained or attended to, through your liver. But, the evolution of mind, as the mind grows up, this attention becomes improved. In an animal, attention is not like this. He is just a straight line, from here to here. In this the attention becomes wider, bigger and intelligent. It has both the things fully developed. In the animals it’s just a few layers of understanding and they are in a straight line, this doesn’t come up in an animal, this ego and superego when they meet this thing covers over. Because of this, closing down, it develops its own awareness. By closing down it develops itself, as Gregoire has said it, as an egg, sometimes. So this is the crust that is formed and it develops within itself, so it is self-contained.

Now for developing this you use your ego or superego, but if you do it in equal way, keeping to the centre, so there is no increase on this side or that side. Now, what is the ego? Is a bulge out here. And what is the superego? Is a bulge out here.  It goes up like a bulge here like a mound, comes out bulging (laughing). Do you understand? Now no use pushing it down or doing anything about it, what you should do is to put attention in the centre here. Centre.

So because of dharma, dharma is the one which keeps the bulge there, attached to you. So the proper, proper road comes in, up to the Nabhi is the bulge, then the waste and all those things drop out, and you keep like this. This is a proper sensible person. But normally it is not. Normally it is the question will be this, and this one just hanging out here. Normally the person is not like this. This comes up like this, I mean, in the West I am saying, and it’s attached like to a [unclear] this one is [unclear]. Now where do you take out? Here? This hand? It’s like that. So now you understand what I mean. Now is it clear now? Attention, supraconscious? It’s a difficult subject. It’s a difficult subject. You understand mentally.

Then above, the God’s attention is not like yours. You see, your attention is much more than an animal’s attention, but God’s attention is manifold dynamic than yours is. So when you become [one] with That, That attention, becomes your attention - It starts flowing through you. So it forms in another way, that is the God’s attention, and you start getting the vibrations in your hands. First time you start, in the conscious mind it starts flowing and you develop that sort of a sheath here, you can say, and you start feeling the vibrations. But again when you go this way a little bit more, it stops; or this way more, it stops. Again you bring it in the centre and gradually allow the space to be more. Now this is what is the surrender, is the space more there. Because you don’t allow this to work out (ego), or this to work out (superego) but just allow a space so it starts opening out, and the light starts working.

Yogi: It’s like in Indian music, when they go like that and they come back to the note.

Shri Mataji: ‘Sum’ that is what it is called as  - Sum. Sum means actually ‘equal’, Sum. Like when they come to that point, to the first point, in the Indian music they go on playing, 14 notes, this is like 16 say, 16 beats. They go 16 into 10 but again they’ll come back to the same point you see. This same, must meet in the same, and that’s it you see. So ‘sum’ is equal. That point, everything has to meet.

And when all this is opened out, actually, here I’ve shown it like that, but you should put that right, connected to the point, in between. This attention goes and is actually connected to the chakras here, so the Kundalini passes through the chakras. We can see there is a chakra here and a chakra here and a chakra here and a chakra here.

When you allow this space to increase more, then what happens [is] these chakras also open out. In these chakras your own Deities are there. They have their own ?? and they are one with it. So it works in unison, and that’s why [unclear].

But this space, leaving this space itself, means surrender, in the normal understanding. Because the dynamic is there, that dynamic is all-pervading, it is working out. Alright? It is all good. It is working out It’s job, it is settled. But the problem is your attention has not grown that subtle, is to enter into it. When it becomes that subtle, only human beings can become that, it opens out. Actually the Kundalini adds that subtleness to it, the subtle system, and She brings it out, and then that subtleness gets, gives, you a lining of subtleness, and that becomes one, subtle with this, and it starts pumping through that subtleness area, vibrations start.

The more you open out this part, you become one with this. So what? You become the Self. Now, this Self, here, this Self is the nucleus in the body and that body is a cell in the bigger body. Alright? So, you become one with the All-Pervading Force, that is the Will of God, which is known to this Self, the nucleus you can say. Every Self knows what God knows, fully, completely.

So as soon as you allow your ‘knowledge’, so-called, to drop out a little bit, the Real Knowledge starts pouring, and then, oh, you can order about. Then you can say whatever you feel like without worrying. But because of this, an ancient stuff with you, the lining being the new one, it’s difficult to identify that lining fully with yourself. If you could, then, you would be just there, no problem of clearing anything, it’s all cleared.

This light, when it flows, this passes through all the chakras and comes out. First the Kundalini comes up, She opens the chakras, makes the place, opens it out. Also, by Her coming up, there’s a little light that comes up. But when this starts pouring down, It covers this much more. But It doesn’t cover directly like that but through the chakras It passes through. That’s why your chakras are to be cleansed out. Because the passage is through the chakras, there is chakras here all opened out chakras here (In Sahastrara perhaps). Alright? Did you follow this?

Michael, how are you feeling? Put it straight. It’s cold? Very cold that hand? You can take it up, you take it up. It’s alright. Close the door. Yes. Now, put your hands together.

Today, as we know that, this is the day of Mohammed Sahib’s birthday and we have to understand that all these incarnations came at different times, They all came at different times, and They came as a continuous process of evolution of man. No question of conflict or anything with them. No question. You see, human beings can’t understand, because they create conflict, they are built for conflicts with this thing closing down. So They just came on this earth, nobody’s property, They came as incarnations on this Earth, all of Them.

He (Mohammed Sahib) came after Christ. You see His position. Because Christ came as an incarnation which was the Son of God, the Son aspect of God. And He talked [unclear]. And the Christian doctrine has followed the suffering, and the Christians must suffer. So, although Christians must suffer, there’s sort of a thing just branded on you. Then anybody kills, you should accept killing. Anybody wants to hurt you, you must accept. ‘You must suffer’. Even if you don’t suffer you must inflict suffering on yourself. This funny doctrine, everybody is surprised, “From where did they get it?” Christ did not suffer. He cannot suffer. How can They suffer? If He could suffer then how was He the Son of God? He could not, it was just a drama. Actually His message was resurrection, but the Christians started using it as a suffering: so They (the Deities) said, “Oh God, now what to do?” So we said now we have to send Somebody else, “Now whom do We send?” Someone Who will be able to teach them there’s no suffering.  We had to send.

How they have been made to suffer. Like I’ll tell you somebody from Muktananda had come to my programme, horrible fellow he was. He came and he started saying all kinds of horrible things there, so the Sahaja Yogis got angry, you know, Modi and all that. He said, “We’ll beat you if you don’t shut up!” He started saying “Oh, you are like this, you are like that” He (Modi) said, you don’t say anything to our Mother or we’ll beat you.” He said, “You are Sahaja yogis and you should bear it”  He said “ “Jolly well they’ll bear you out” He said “Throw him out” I said “Just now. and give him two kicks! Just now you throw him out, immediately” If he had said anything to Christ’s Mother, He would have taken the same cross and hit all of them nicely. That’s why it was arranged that nothing should be said about Christ’s Mother because that would have been the sensitive point, on that point He would never have compromised.

So this foolish idea that all these religious people should suffer. And then why the religion? Why should you have the religion? I mean if you have to have suffering when you are part of a religion, better not have such a horrible religion! You see, it is like purchasing fruit (??) suffering. No! Where did it say? I don’t know. Where in the Bible it is said that “All the Christians must suffer”? I don’t know what point you get from there!

Yogi: It is reported in the Bible that Jesus said to a young man that, if you want to follow me take your cross or something like that.

Shri Mataji: Alright. That doesn’t mean that you suffer! “If you want to follow me take your cross” Now, what is cross? You know that it is the symbol of innocence. I say take your cross, because, if you are coming here, as you are, you have to be moulded, you have to be brought to the proper balance, so you a little bit suffer. When you try to test other’s vibrations, you do get your hiccups of that burning and all that. That’s not the way He must have understood, carrying your cross, is not…what is your cross? I mean [it’s] absurd I tell you, the whole understanding of Christ. You make such a Great Personality into nothing, absolutely! He came here to teach you to suffer? I mean can you think of such a thing!  What brains and what intelligence all your, these ‘great’ priests are using to say that, “He came here to teach you to suffer”.

Yogi:  They probably feel naturally miserable so they think others also should

Shri Mataji: (laughing) No, no, but the preaching is that, “You must suffer”. Now even if you take like this a position. You can say that it was that, that if anybody says [something bad] to you, you just don’t bother about it, don’t bother about it. But why suffer? Suffering means that you bother about it! Otherwise you just don’t bother about it.

Yogi: I think it’s just a rationalisation of impotency. I think it is that way. Because they were unable to do anything, the priests were unable, they were seeing people suffering around and they were not able to help them, then they said that, “Accept your suffering and enjoy it”

Shri Mataji: Enjoy your suffering? No it’s an absurd doctrine of [unclear]

Yogi: The original doctrine was that you offer you sufferings to God but then it got twisted that you have to feel miserable. What suffering comes to you you have to accept it and offer it to God.

Shri Mataji: You see, it is, I wish, you could say, it’s an offering or anything. God’s name or God Itself is a balm. You see, you have pain in the stomach, when you put hands towards Me, supposing, you get alright. Finished! Now what are you offering to Me? I’m not going to get anything. It’s such a different thing altogether. Suffering and God are two different things. God is the One who balms (cures) your suffering. What is that 23rd Psalm is? Does it say you suffer? Where such a big doctrine has come up? From where I don’t know: that you have to suffer. It is all the time [unclear]

Even those who are suffering will be helped…”blessed are those”

Gavin Brown: But supposing you had not come, we would not have understood what Christ was about.

Yogi: We are suffering because there is a mess around, and the only way we can bear it is in thinking that our suffering has a meaning.

Shri Mataji: The simple meaning is, because of your mistakes you are suffering! It’s a very simple thing, you know. It’s very, very simple. You human beings, put them on one side, God on another side, alright? You cut each other’s throats - God has told you to cut each other’s throats? If there is war – Then who? God has created war? Say, this also, if you neglect yourself, you do all kinds of things, then you suffer! Who has asked you to read so many books? Who has asked you for someone to create so many books? What do you know to create so many books? Nothing! So, it’s you who are doing it, so you face it also here! Did God ask you to write so many books and read them and condition yourself? Who has asked you to listen to Freud?

But inside you, He’s all the time talking and telling you. It’s not that He’s given you up, He’s all the time guiding you. Only thing you should have done is to accept His advice. All the time He’s telling you, “It’s wrong, it’s too much you are doing it,” you can even see your ego, what more do you want to see? When you know your horse is being a fast one, so why not make it a slow moving one? You know you are missing your targets, why not straighten it up?

Did God tell you all these things the way you are suffering, suffering? The one who has committed that sin, did God go and tell him that you commit that sin? He must be going somewhere in a hurry, he must go…(break in recording)

…there is God and also we know that He is reflected in us, in our heart as Spirit, as Atma, as Self. Now, when we know about the 3 channels that are working within us, of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati; the 3 powers of Ida, Pingala and Sushumna, which create the sub-conscious, pre-conscious and the conscious mind, are working in our consciousness. That means we are conscious of them. We are conscious of our Left and Right, that is Ida and Pingala sympathetic nervous system. We are not conscious of the parasympathetic. That means that we can increase the rate of our heart, we can increase the rate of our breathing but we cannot decrease it. The decrease, or what you call the lowering down of the rate, is done by parasympathetic. So the parasympathetic is active, but we are not conscious of it, in the sense that we have no control over it.

The Spirit, that is God, which is reflected in us, resides in the heart. The manifestation of Spirit in our heart controls the parasympathetic, but this Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty in our heart, as if in a mirror. And Divine Love, which is the light of God, is reflected in us, through the reflection of the Spirit as the unconscious mind.

So within us there is an area about which we are not conscious, that is why it is called as unconscious. That area lies so far away from our conscious mind that we cannot control it, we are not conscious of it, but it acts, through parasympathetic activity. How it acts, I will give you a simile: Supposing there is a power [that] works, somewhere, and it is acting through this (electric) light over here. You don’t see the power work or the factory or wherever the power is created, but what you see is the manifestation here and you see the light. But supposing you do not see the light nor the lamp nor the factory but you are affected by it, that is the situation of a human being. A normal human being, who is not a realised-soul, is not aware of that factory which is God, or the light it has got, is not aware of the lamp that he has got in his heart, and is also not aware of the light that the lamp is emitting. But it is acting.

So the unconscious mind is nothing else but the projection of God’s Will, through the light of Divine Love.

I have given this simile again and again, which is very good and apt: that, these two powers that are within us, one on the left, another on the right hand side, are there and we are conscious of them and we use them. Out of them, the Right we use it in absolute awareness. Left one, we know is used as sub-conscious mind, and sometimes, if you take drugs or you do something like that, then you go to your sub-conscious also, so you can become aware of the sub-conscious area also.  So you become, you are aware of, the right hand side already, and you are aware of the sub-conscious sometimes when you try to get aware of it.

So these two powers that are within us are all the time vibrating in a wave and the points at which they meet, they create the throb, or you can say the centre. Centre is created, a Deity is placed [there], but there is no light for us to see or to feel or to be conscious of the Deities. Deities are fast asleep.

When the Kundalini rises, now Kundalini is the sub-conscious, you’ll be surprised that Kundalini is a Mahakali power, She is absolutely pure, in the purest form, because She is not used. We can say [that] part of it is used in us, our subconscious, sort of, we have kept some water separately which we have not used so far. So first of all we use the sub-conscious water and the pre-conscious water and we dirty it, we exhaust it. Then this stored up power rises, and does the last cleansing. But when She rises She creates a third current, [but] still that third current, when She is rising, doesn’t have the light. But when It reaches the Sahastrara and pierces it, then it becomes one with the Universal Consciousness. Because what is God? Is the One who controls the Universal Consciousness. She is The Controller of the Universal Consciousness. She emits the light and when this Kundalini rises it gets that flame on it. So now all the Deities get awakened.

Now, you may say that, “This is in the heart, Mataji you are saying, you are saying it is here,” there is a confusion people think. But actually it is All-Pervading. Say, God is a nucleus you can say or a factory, which has the light all over and is reflected in the heart. So when your Kundalini, a particular individual Kundalini, touches that, then this  light takes place, then in the heart the Spirit is ignited, or sort of it emits, it’s manifest, it projects. And it’s projections are these vibrations.

So, through this, you know the Will of God. Through this you have a dialogue with God and you understand Him, what He wants. And what does He want [is for] you to know there are 3 qualities of God which you can feel through this.

One: what is the Truth. You ask any questions, if you are asking for something, and if it is in ‘yes’ then you will get too many vibrations. If it is in ‘no’ vibrations will lower down. That’s how you can verify what is right and what is wrong. What is the Truth, what is not the Truth, now you can know. Nobody has to tell you, you don’t need any clergyman or anybody to certify it -  it is there, through your vibrations you can feel it – this is the Truth or not? Is it a correct place you have come to or to the wrong place? Then also the various combinations and permutations of these, it is true, but still there’s a little point that is wrong in you. For example, if you say that, “Christ was resurrected in person?” Yes, that’s true, you’ll get more vibrations. But if you see now, that, if you say, “Is it Mataji the Mother of Christ?” If you do not accept it, you will not get it on the Sahastrara.
