Advice to Realized Souls in Bordi (India), 26 January 1977.

I’ll try to cover most of the points that you’ve asked but I must say that I was very happy to hear most of the questions because that shows that your enquiry is getting subtler and subtler, that you already know about the gross side of chakras, and now you want to know the subtler forms.

Now the first question was, which should be taken up first is the one, “How the chakras come into human beings, what time, what stage of life,” because that should be the first question?  This question is something like if we ask, “What time a primule comes into the being of a seed,” is something like that. That a human being when he dies, as I’ve told you before he does not die fully, only a part of him dies which is mostly the earth element and the rest of the elements remain there. The rest of the body disappears and you can’t see it because it is not a complete human form. It goes on decreasing in size and the Kundalini leaves the body and stays outside, outside the body. And the Atma, what we call the spirit, also leaves the body, and stays outside the body, which is the remaining body.

The constitution of this new body is different from our constitution. You can say a light that is extinguished has all the body except for the light.  But the light goes out of that body. In the same way in a human being who dies the Spirit and the Kundalini leave the body, but they’re around that body and it’s a great procedure that follows which is fantastic. It’s unbelievable how the body disappears into different elements also.

But first of all let us see when such bodies which remain like that, they go into what you call the Pretloka there they become seeds or they become smaller and smaller and smaller.  Till one body forms a ova and a what you know as a sperm. In one body it is formed. I don’t know if you have seen the division of chromosomes how it takes place. Is a complete division, if the chromosome is like that, it’s a complete multiple division and a complete separation takes place. That is why marriages and selection of partners, all these have a great place for ordinary bodies, it does not matter for the Divine. They take place in such a manner that there can be at random connections established.

For example a ova of one may combine with the sperm of another. It happens at a very lower stage of evolution; among human beings also it happens like that. For some people who are just not really evolved we can say. But mostly the ova rejects the sperm, it only except that sperm which is meant to be accepted. Now it is such a minuet work, it is so fantastic, that it is unbelievable. We have no idea as to how God works out (sounds like- things,) it’s absolutely tremendous, that even the ova, rejects, goes on rejecting the sperm that is not the second part of itself. And that’s how so many sperms are wasted and so many ova’s are wasted.

So you can imagine that there is a tremendous machinery, which is working out this. Specially people who are realized if when they are reborn all the forces of the Divine combine to see that these, this ova is placed with a person who is ultimately going to meet the person who has the proper sperm, so that there is no problem as far as the meeting is concerned. And the Divine takes all the care of these great souls.  The work of the Divine is very, very fantastic and it is beyond human conception to understand how the awareness of God can look after all the minute small things of the world.

You cannot do even a small thing like attaching this to this one unless and until you pay some human attention, so you can imagine the attention of God who invades so many seeds in this Mother Earth and gives you such huge big trees. I mean, you have taken them for granted but if you watch you will see this fantastic, dynamic force behind it, thinking, it does it so perfect. But we think that it is all automatic and that’s how we can bear it, and that’s how we can bear Sahaja yoga also, thinking that it is all automatic.

The second question is, “When did the chakras then are in the body imbedded.” They exist in the body and they go on existing. Of course they get corrected every time the body takes birth and goes into a new seed. And the Kundalini also, every birth you are born is watching as to what your doing how your chakras are developing how it is working out and through the method of balancing you or parasympathetic system or you can call universal unconscious, the chakras are brought to its proper shape and to its proper condition by evolution.

A man makes mistakes he makes searches, he searches from one place to another. For example, he may start to search in money, he may start to search in power, then he starts to search in love, I mean the carnal love, or he may start his search some emotional expression, then in art and all those things. Ultimately he finds that the search has not been all right because he has not been able to achieve any state of joy in his existence and with his search these chakras go on evolving and understanding.

Now we have to know that these chakras are absolutely living entities because when a person is supposed to be dead that time all the Deities are not in the working state. But the living man has the chakras, which has got the Deities, which work out the different functions of the chakras. It’s a very, very subtle working and these can be called as the reflecting mirrors at different levels of our awareness where the Deities, which are placed in the primordial being, the Virata, are reflected.

And there, once awakened, start working out the plan of the Divine. In some of the human beings when they are searching these chakras, find that the person or the subject is going to the extremes of things and this comes because the human being has got freedom to choose. And in his freedom he goes to the extremes, and by going to the extremes the chakras get damage.  Going to the extremes is what we call is sin. To be in the center to lead a moderate, simple balanced life and stick to the values of our sustenance is the best life.

But if you start going to the extremes then the sin starts and the sin in the Bible it is written, “That the wages of sin is death,” so the death occurs. Now the death, actually you know doesn’t take place but what happens is that the part of the chakra gets damaged. It can be a physical hankering, it can be mental, it can be emotional, it can be spiritual, it can be anything. If you go on working out an imbalance solution then these chakras get spoilt at different point. That’s how you chakras get spoilt.

The chakra are according to our awareness in different state. For example for a doctor or for all of us, we know that we have plexuses in our body, you know we have different plexus’s.  Like you can say pelvic plexus, we’ve got solar plexus, we’ve got aortic plexus, we have got cardiac plexus, we have got cervical plexus, you have got optic chiasma, you’ve got limbic area, to act on you can say pituitary and pineal body at optic chiasma, and then you have got limbic area where your have got certain points that are active. This every doctor knows because they have even tested limbic area of some monkeys and they found that if you excite the limbic area of the monkeys they feel very joyous there’s electricity. So all these chakras in the body of a human being are only felt as gross expressions, which we call as plexus in the parasympathetic and sympathetic channels.

They’re all connected as I’ve told you, that the sympathetic comes from both the sides and creates the central channel and that is the parasympathetic. It depends on the balance of both these sympathetic, that the parasympathetic works out well.

When the balance brakes up any balance can upset both of them, and when it is completely broken then they become on their own, and that is how it is the complete so called, liberation of man from Gods grace.

Once he is completely liberated from that thing he starts falling into the state of, as you call them rakshas, he goes to hell, I mean he goes to the other kind of awareness where there is no feeling, no consciousness of conscious. He doesn’t think twice, he can kill hundred people without even feeling bad about it. He looses all his emotional side and also he looses all his wisdom. What remains in him is his own ambitions and his own desires (inaudible) and he goes on without feeling any compunction or any binding from the Divine or his own dharma.

So these chakras are very important for us because first of all they give us the balance for our everyday existence. They give us God, and we can think of subtle things and abstract things. This all comes through the help of the chakras. If you ask Me if the animals have the chakras, they have but they don’t have all of them separated, sometimes they’re confused chakras and all the chakras are not separated from each other, and they are not all opened out because of their evolutionary process is not yet complete. But some animals I’ve seen have got their awakened Kundalini and they’re realized animals I’ve seen.

So it is possible even for animals to be very dharmic than men are, and sometimes it’s surprising how they can discriminate better than human beings can. Apart from that animals are kept under the bondage of God and whatever their sustenance is done by them; they don’t have to think about it.  For example a dog is a dog, a cat is a cat, and a tiger is a tiger.  It’s only the human beings can be a dog, can be a scorpion, can be a snake and can be a saint. So it’s only possibility in the human being that you can find all the animals existing side by side, and can be that these animals can come out and you may be surprised at yourself the way they suddenly jump out and start barking at you.

So that is what human beings are because whatever has been in our past is within us, whatever animals we have been is within us, so all that is there. But whatever we are going to be also is there, what ever we are going to achieve is also there.

For human beings the future, past, present exists, but for God it does not. So for Him to plan and to organize and arrange is very easy stuff because if you do not have such demarcating things you just organize things much better.  And these methods are because of His own, I should say awareness, status, Almightiness, I can say or saintly nature that He’s like that, that He can manage things very well. And you cannot explain them with one event after another event, how He has managed and how it has happened. He does it just because He is capable of doing that. He need not do it all that with understanding or thinking about it as human beings do because he does not have to think either because He’s that, you see.  He is the power and He does everything.  He is the consciousness so he does everything without putting any effort into it.

And is a very different state, which perhaps you can understand as Sahaja Yogis that just you move your hands, and you’ll find the Kundalini will move the other side and you may think why is it moving after all, you must think about it. You are realized so you can do it but not a person who is not realized if he put is hand like that a hundred times, nothing is going to work out. Only you can raise the Kundalini. Raising is your awareness is different and his awareness is the different. Your powers are different and his powers are different. In the same way God who is all powerful, for Him even moving His finger He can move the whole universe, after all He’s God. And that’s why for human beings it is said, “That you better have faith in God because that’s the best way you can solve your problem.”

If you go on thinking about it you’ll all go crazy. So we have to go to a point where you can understand Him otherwise you’ll all go crazy understanding him and you’ll all become so mad you see watch all these things beyond us it is so much.

But because in Sahaja Yoga now your awareness has come really in such subtler form one can understand so many things and can understand the subtler ways of Gods doing and also understand what is possible for you through subtle methods. You can talk on subtler things but talking this to anybody who is not a Sahaja Yogi would be something madness, they wouldn’t understand a word I’m saying is only meant for the people who are Sahaja Yogis.

So we came to a point where I said that, “In the gross they’re expressed as plexus in the human being.” Now this is known as the gross (inaudible) now in the gross form you have to see, the sukshma as they call it, the subtle form. The subtle form exists in the human being, which you can see you have seen, the subtle form as energy when it starts pulsating, you have seen the pulsation. But this subtle form is in two forms you can say, one is a sukshma and then atti sukshma. Because in the sukshma you can see and a person who (Delete Background conversation) is a realized soul, if you are a realized soul then you see even the chakras, in the sense you can feel the chakras on your fingers.

A unrealized soul can see the pulsation of the Kundalini and the different chakras with his own eyes, he can, if he watches it clearly he can see the different chakras clearly and you as Sahaja Yogis can feel them on your fingers and also can feel them within yourself in the collective conscious.  There is, you can say in the second stage of sukshma, there are three stages as you can say sukshma, sukshma taras and sukshma tuma, three stages you can see. The first stage you see is on your finger is the sukshma karana you can say, but with the eye you see is a sukshma and if your fingers or on your chakras when you feel it is, you can say is sukshma tuma.  So you see them in three forms.

If some of the people do not feel it on the fingers can feel it on the chakras also.  So you can feel it in three ways but there’s a fourth way where you can say it is in the Karana, Karana state that’s the higher state where a realize soul can feel it.  He’s born as a realize soul, can feel it and in that state they just know like a computer. They don’t bother as to which is the one, and they don’t put hands or anything, they just feel it, it is so.

As you have seen in my granddaughter case she just knows what is what. Just you ask her she immediately says this is this, this is this, this is this, like that. It comes plain to them absolutely this is this. Now you may say that how do they know? But this procedure becomes such a compact thing, I mean it just happens to you like a pin pricking here, immediately the hand goes back sort of the whole reflex action is so quick that we can say there is no procedure as such it is just a reflex action.

In the same way it acts as a reflex action so that, you see you don’t have to worry about the purpose of it.

That is state where we say the Karana state is reached. And in Mahakarana state, now this is the third stage is it, and even in the karana stage there are three stages into which one feels it.  Now this, I would say that, I need not explain because that’s beyond you people but if you are born realized you will understand that imbalance in a personality of the three gunas, of the three gunas is immediately pursued by a born realized soul, immediately pursued you can feel you see. (Delete you see). That’s the wisdom he’s gained in his previous lives (inaudible.) Immediately they can see the imbalance that comes in you see, and whatever they say is so wise and they understand because they can see the imbalance of these three gunas and according to their own gunas which ever are prevalent in them, these three stages exist in them the way they say.

For example some people have a say, are more say tamo gunis, means the ones who are very emotional type people, among them some are very emotional. So they see a person through the emotions, you see the way they feel in themselves they call it the feeling. “I had a feeling for such a person. I felt that way.” That is the word they use.

But supposing the person is rago guni he has been more towards the, going through say, he has been working on the rajo guna like praying to suyura and praying to doing Gyatri then praying to all the heavenly bodies and also the five elements, like that. You see has been doing yagyas and all those things he’s a rajo guni. Such people see them as light as electrical form, so they see them as colours and things you see this is this. So one sees it as an emotional thing another sees it as a colour or you can say as any form. They see them as form or colours, like they see as electrical currents and some them as a different flowers.

Now we are feelings and also they are love, means rajo guni expressions, which you can see with your eye, see the creation itself.

But they’re also feelings so those who can see feelings more, a person who has been very loving and has dealt in this side of life, who has been a bhakti man you can say, a dedicated man, who has been praying to God and crying for Him and asking for His help and weeping before Him with all his heart. Such a man will feel a person more and a person who is a more dedicated say to forms and things he’ll see them in a different way as forms so then they see them in colours because they’re also colours. They’re also colours and they’re also sounds. So the sounds is also one of the elements, so they can see a sound. They also see them when the Kundalini moves you see, they see the sound moving and they also (sounds like - saw.) Most of the people who have seen this have been the people who have been meditating through this we can say, the Patanjali style of meditation where there’s a single people parshu rama style.

And they saw these forms and they saw the movement of the Kundalini through the chakras when it passes it creates a sound, a word. And so they studied every sound how this sound was created, what sound was created what color was there. And so it is a one sided knowledge of the right hand side of the people who went to the right hand side that they say that, “This thing was created, that thing was created” and then “This sound was created.” Then they formed the language, is original Sanskrit language which was formed that’s why it’s called as a Dev-vani and that’s why these Deities understand Sanskrit the best.

When you say Sanskrit mantras you see, they absolutely understand them very fast because this has come originally from there. They studied that and then they closed off. But other language is in India, most of the languages were taken from Sanskrit converted into something else, brought to another form and then another Sanskrit (inaudible)(sounds like- tarkita Sanskrit) Hindi five languages (inaudible) and all these, these languages came.

So it is variegation, other languages in other countries that came up you see, was also of course the expression of the Kundalini but they learnt it more from the, the words came from the, more from the outside you see, the sound of the air flowing they call it, so they call it airs like that. And from the nature what ever they learnt from outside, because the approach has been more objective, so objective approach is always little less than the subjective because subjective is from inside and objective is form outside.

So when you go from the objective the deviation into the main sound that are coming from the inside, this is the purity is little bit deviated. As you know what is objective and subjectivity approach. So this is, happened with some languages. Some languages are very, very close to Sanskrit and, but they too took a turn according to their gunas.

Now, the Satya guni, the central path or the Satva guni as they call it you see. There also the people who have Satva guna more in them they see chakras in the right form. But Satva guni should not be confused with the people who believe that if you eat this then this is satvik, if you eat that that is tamsik or if you say this, this is satvik or if you do not kill anybody then it is satvik  in this the right perception comes in. For example, you have to explain why Krishna killed so many rakshas’s because actually it is Sat, is dharmic, absolutely dharmic. Why Durga killed so many rakshas. She had to eat the blood of so many rakshas. So what ever is dharmic, the wisdom, the right path comes through such people who are neither to much this side, neither that side and they know exactly what is the right way of looking at life.

Such born realized people this is a very, very far-fetched stuff they are very few. I would say perhaps you can say Buddha and Mahavira are the only two human beings who have gone through many lives, from one extreme to another they went and ultimately they found out that going to the extremes is not proper. Still they have not reached the complete height of an incarnation.

So the model was to be created who would all the time giving a fixed point for a person to rise to that. And these are the different models, which are placed within us on our chakras and these models are a perfect one, belonging to those chakras.  So according to the nature of the person who is watching these chakras one sees them and gives them importance also.  Now for a person like Shankacharya, Shankacharya is a born realized soul many a times. He’s not born realized once but many a times he’s born realized, and he’s sort of, he’s in the center of it you can say, one of the, you can call it. So when he talks of his Mooladhara chakra he is sort of, he has already done the path many a times and now he’s going to the subtler and subtler and subtler forms. So when he says that the Mooladhara chakra is opened out then you can walk on the water is correct, because he is at that subtle stage of attainment. One has to ascend once, second time, third time, forth time, and then you see, you reach a stage where you start ascending. But even then it is not so important. To walk on the water what is so important to walk on the water. It’s nothing so important because you see you can take a boat and walk. There’s nothing so important, so walking on the, means also on the right hand side. Is the right hand side to walk on the water or to say, fly in the air? All these things are right hand side things, which also can be done with the help of a boat, or what you call an aircraft or even you can use a bhoot. For that you can use a dead entity and we can make him take us to any place we feel like. This can be done this ESP business is only that.

So it can be done by other methods also. This is nothing important that it is sometimes very confusing when you see that some people can fly in the air, this in the subtle form they have gone. You don’t see the body or anything but you see that they have, they can feel it. The difference being that the people who are realized can guide themselves and can see the body moving.  But those who are not realized they find that their subtle being is taken out and their consciousness going with them somewhere else and they’re sitting on top of the house and they’re watching themselves and they’re still there and they’ll see themselves sitting down like that. You see these phenomenon take place, that is absolutely nothing but souls being ridden by a dead entity. So there’s nothing great about it. That is also right side stuff.

The left hand side as I told you is the emotional feeling about things you see. You feel tremendous love for others and sometimes you know people, I would say Sainath was one of them who had this left hand side just within him. And he was love personified and, I mean he was so much full of love for people that once I was in the woman who was very poor and she couldn’t celebrate her Diwali day and he couldn’t bear it so he gave her some water and the water became like oil and she burnt lights it that. It’s a fact, you can do that, is possible and with this power you can increase food sort of thing you see. You increase the food stuff you are going to some (inaudible) stages you see.  That’s also one side.

So all these things come in a personality, some people have one more another has some more and some people have all these qualities. Some, those who are incarnations have everything, they can do anything that they want to. And they will use whatever they want to do.  If they don’t want use any powers they will not use. So it depends on, so it’s nothing important, supposing you see something all right, there you can see it is a good thing. But that doesn’t mean that you should stick on to those things but you must try to do what you don’t see. For example, now you see the light coming out of somebody’s head, now that’s one side of looking at things.

Another is that you can feel the other person, if you feel the other person how he is, how he meets you, how you are coming closer to that person.  Can you feel that compassion for him that he’s not where you are? That’s also is another balancing (stuff.)

But this should done, this is very dangerous for some people who try to be helpful to others when they are not themselves solidified properly.

So I would again warn you that when you start seeing lights and all that try to remember that you are going on one side and you are seeing more and be more compassionate in you tongues, in your talking and behaviour.  Try to have more love.  Means right hand side is more developing the left is less, is the heart.

So you have to raise your Kundalini from right and left, but it’s not mechanical it works out.  It’s only thinking about it, “Oh, I have to develop my heart more,” the balance has to be there. This also should develop feeling for others. Now the feeling for others cannot be explained as I feel for others.

I just see someone is crying anywhere I just get tears into my eyes automatically.

Even if you are not crying and you can feel hurt about; things I get this hurt feeling within Myself. Like that you should really feel that hurt feeling and that desperate feeling and that cry.  Of course I mean, it comes to some people too much but they do not have the other side. So you should have both the sides and both the balancing directors within you.

So those who are seeing things more should not go on bothering about what they’re feeling becoming them is, all right, because they have done that sort of tapasya through their seeking and it helps Sahaja Yoga very much because you can see for your self who is realize who’s not realized (inaudible) that way.

But still the dryness is in you so if it is in you, you should try to develop it. So what ever you don’t have you try to develop that and whatever you have don’t be satisfied with that. That’s the best way you can rise. You see those people who can see things should try to feel others.  Those who can feel others should see things and it will work out that way. So this is what it is and in the Mahakarana state where the Mahakarana is, that is a very, very subtlest form, state where the chakra which have got the Deities are connected with the, sort of reflection of the Deity of the Virata.

Now these Deities in the Virata are reflected in you, are awakened in you and they start moving and making the whole thing work out, as it should. Up to the Karana state it is very good but the Mahakarana is the state where it is the real what you call the optic, optic and deflection. When you can come up to the optic which is a really deep state of mind where you are with the optic and when you are at the optic you are very close to an incarnation state.

So we can say that as far as you people are concerned you should try to understand up to Karana state, because beyond that how to jump and how to go is not the question just now.  What’s the use of telling about something which is a far fetched stuff so we’ll talk about it later.  But this is how it is the fourth state of chakra.  Now (inaudible/ part;hindi) You see it’s anticlockwise, you do see, because most of the people who have seen it have seen it on other people and when you see on other people from backside, you see it on anticlockwise side. But if you see it from the front it is clockwise, that side.

(Question to Shri Mataji, which is inaudible)

What I’ve just now told you that the chakras, say for example, for an ordinary human being the chakras are nothing but ordinary plexus, for a realized soul it is more than that. So the more you move into a greater being of your own awareness that’s how the chakras start manifesting.  Now for example My chakras are working all over, all over this is the difference.  It depends on the awareness of person that’s why deeper sense (inaudible). As much as the light of it, that’s what it does, expression of the light, you see as much as the power, so that is what it is.

Now if there are any questions left on chakras?

Number of petals are also gross stuff you see, till you go to a certain stage, till your petals are being created, because of a, there’s a little mathematics about it, little mathematics. And all these mathematics have been worked out in a human being how it is. But these are the, you can say that now for example, in a person a light is there, say 25 watt, 25 watts. Now 25 watts are to be converted say, to say 50 watts or something like that. So you have to see the dimension into which the person is that portion is going to grow, you see. It’s a big mathematics about it, its dimension to which that can grow, you see. And into what tier it is going to penetrate, for example, the Mooldhara chakra you can take for example, Mooldhara chakra is actually forced that way, because it covers the four sides of the human personality. It’s a bit abstract calculation; it is the four side of the personality and the fifth side, the movement in the fifth dimension doesn’t take in the Mooldhara chakra it takes above the Mooldhara chakra.

So the fourth dimensions are shown by that, you see, these are the different dimensions of a man at those levels how many dimensions is touched by these petals, it is calculated like that. In My book I’ve given notes of these in very great details as to what are the dimensions one touches in this state and how far you go.

But the same Mooldhara becomes only two later on but it is such a subtle and sharp thing it is very, very, I mean which penetrates just like this all over.  So it depends on the, you can say in a machine you have different types of bones and different types of (inaudible) and with different dates. Now what is the calculation (inaudible,) you can say why it is so.

So you see it is very detailed work and it’s all worked out because the dimensions into which a human being is to go, all that is worked out, and on that chakra only this is dimension you achieve, so it has a meaning. But it’s not only four chakras, it’s not only four it has got many petals inside and it’s a very interesting one.

Actually Mooldhara I have written a big chapter complete.  How many folds are inside and how these things work out and how many folds, what do they suggest and how far they open out, because it’s all a dimension which is worked out.  For example, if you take a Banyon tree, the seed is so small, a Banyon tree has the smallest seed. Now why is it so and why is it so microscopic, because it is so dynamic?

So you see all worked out like a capsule you see, and it’s a capsule, which is to work this dimension, it has to work that dimension.  So it is a sort of rather a calculated stuff, which I have described. I have only described Mooldhara really in the full, this thing because it makes such a big volume of one Mooldhara chakra, that I gave up about others I just made sure about that.

But only Mooldhara itself when I started to describing it became such a big huge thing. I gave in I said, “Now better not do other work.”  But it’s quite a complicated stuff you see and, you see God has his own stage, style of planning and you can’t question Him. He does it according to His own whim you know, He’s an own style but His whim has understanding, everything has.

You will find that sometimes you see, if you try to study that, if you ask Me certain things I try to answer it in a different way, you see.

Because there are His ways of doing things and He understands and that’s how He does it. But still I’ve tried to bring out at least Mooldhara chakra, so that human beings must understand that how complicated they are made, how God has been so careful to place their Mooldhara so well and how He has put the force there, how it’s a living machinery, how it’s working out so that people should understand the importance of their chakras. And importance of their being, how important you are. You are not ordinary people.

Even if there’s a say an ordinary tape recorder, we are so careful about it. How much we should be careful about our own machinery, which is being created in ages with such great understanding, such mechanism. Every chakra if you take up, even if you take up three yugas, you won’t understand one chakra. It is such a tremendous working inside. I’ve of course given the, only the description of it and the reason why is a stage which will make you really mad, I’ve tried to explain in that. You have read My Mooldhara did you? It’s quite elaborate stuff.

Question: What is the purpose of life?

But that stage I never cancelled it, that stage is not today. See when I said it that just now, “You have to incarnate again and again.” You are not at that stage. But when the whole thing you see, nothing is wrong in any one of these. When they say, “There is a day of judgment,” but before that God is going to give you chance, He is going to give you full chance to improve yourself to go to that position.

You see like that we can say that, “First the trees are brought into the by sowing the seeds then the trees grow up, then there are flowers, then the flowers are again, they become seeds. Then again trees, again this thing, until again they reach a certain stage, until they have completely ripened, then they know will know the whole stage and the whole thing becomes the Brahma itself. And what ever is a waste matter is thrown out.

So ultimately the union, but the union of your being means with God. Is a much greater state, first of all is the purification point. You see for your purification you are to be born again, you have not reached that state where you should become Mahanivar.

Have you?  If you become mighty you might land up in hell, so better not try that? See you must understand that just now, at this stage you have to go further, purify yourself till you reach a certain stage you see where, there you reach a certain stage at that time, God has given you enough chance, enough chance to improve yourself. Still you are rakshas, then you are not going to be tried any more. But it’s quite clear, I must say, you cannot now allow it to take the chance, it’s crazy. (Delete – Marathi) (inaudible) one of the butchery is going to be very close, is very close, I mean I would say can be anytime. You be careful I mean it’s just there. So many have to be (sounds like neutralized) because they’re just been troublesome. It can be quite close so just be careful about it. So you see everything fits into everything else but what happens is every religion, part of it is said so this cuts out the other. Supposing I say, “You have to go to this room,” now if I say that, “You have to come three steps that side,” and then I said, “You have to come three steps this side,” these are all connected stuff. But because it is said only three steps here so you say, “Then in that religion it is said three steps inside.” And what about those three steps, I have to tell about them also.  Because I have to tell about all those things that you have to take first, I better not tell about these three steps (inaudible) because you’ll put your eyes, oh, very nice. It’s not going to come in a plate. You have to work it out consciously. Understand now.

Chakra is within you, chakra is a place, exists within you.  (Shri Mataji is interrupted.)  No, no they are in the body only, they’re in the body.  The body becomes like a seed, you see you become like a seed.  But they are potent, you can’t see them. Chakra is a state. (Delete- Question Asked)

It is something like a light going out and the tube is still there, is like that the Kundalini, but it stays on top of the head of the person. Only difference is that the, supposing the light goes out and stays near by. You see the potential is there in the light it is light. The place for the light to pass is there is the.

(Inaudible question)

They’re already separated in the gross they’re separated; inside also they’re separated but there’s a void,(sounds like-because) that is the only point. You see the Kundalini gets enlightened a sort of serious little enlightened you can say. Then it faces me and (it/thing?) starts rising or when you people, because you are also Sahaja Yogis. It doesn’t happen with anybody else you’ll be amazed you know.

So now what is the other question?

Question: How do the chakras move in the body?

You see (inaudible) today are moving horizontal, they’re moving horizontal but when you move them like this you see, like you have seen the wheel.  (Shri Mataji interrupted)  No it doesn’t work out, it works out better this way. Because  (Delete you are) you see these are the things that are emitting you see. If you do it like this it goes down. You see this way you, these are moving you can move this. You have seen in a watch there are some like this parallel and some are like this.

(Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi. Question asked – inaudible)

You see what gurus do is to, they use different chakras for introducing into the sympathetic nervous system some entities, which they have controlled you see. They do not control many entities as such, but what happens for example now I would say, during war many people died just like that you see, killed this and that. In those countries those souls, you see, they were never, (delete- sort of were never) never had a human life and they were treated just like animals, and they were very much tortured. So they had that feeling in their minds that we should also torture these people, like that. So when they come, they die you see, they do not die really but, and they do not get into the Pretaloka they stay in the atmosphere and that’s why war is a very bad thing because wars create such human beings much more with accidents and people who are very depressed in life, very dissatisfied who are doing all kinds of depraved actions and secretive things and all kinds of horrid things, you see, and all such people, all of them. When they die they do not really go to pretaloka because they don’t think of their salvation but they are just thinking of their lust, greed or sort of you can say possessions, those who are grabbing things, thieves and all sorts of people. We can call evil people and satanic people, when they die they (Delete- they, when they die they) find they become much more subtler and they can be better off if they act in a subtle body, so they use the subtle body for acting into people and such people are easily available. So these gurus, what they do that they themselves are evil geniuses, and they have a way of capturing those people and they use them. And they introduce you through your different chakras for example, Ravana had a capacity to speak and when he speaks he use to introduce rakshas’s into the human beings in Ceylon, otherwise imagine in Lanka.

People should never fight Rama because at that time the sensitivity of people was so great that they knew that Rama was an incarnation. They were not gross as today they are that one has to tell that, “Oh, here I am the incarnation.”  It was not Kali Yuga so they knew he was an incarnation and so many of them, I mean some of them did not, but quite a lot of them knew and despite that nobody could appose it because their mind was captured by these entities by Ravana and they fought.

It was so, even at the time of Krishna people knew who He was at least they had quite an idea, even the Kauravas new about it.

But this Kali Yuga is a retched thing nobody see anything clearly. But those who died were not like that people knew who was an incarnation and they understood it.

At that time also these people had to use some sort of a way of putting them off and they used this method of enticement.

And when they used this method of enticement in that use they learned also subtler ways and subtler ways, they started using in Kali Yuga, very well. They are actually Rakshas’s and they no these methods how to entice people there are so many ways of doing it.

And when you bend your head before them that is the best time when they can put it into your ego and they can finish you off for once for all. That’s how they do it and you are no more yourself.

First of all they act on your heart. You become a nervous person your hands start shaking your feet start shaking, they act on your heart chakra.  You use the power of Raksha which is the basic point of the heart chakra, the optic (sounds like Hindi word-nhyia).

And then when she starts moving the (grip/grate) over your nerves of find that as if somebody is doing for you. And if you take somebody’s name you start jumping and you don’t know anything, is an experience, you see. There are so many things they do like that, thousand and one. But human beings as a whole in the Kali Yuga instead of improving has gone down absolutely in his conception of dignity and in everything. I mean he’s a hopeless case otherwise, but by God’s grace Sahaja Yoga may save him.

They way it is I mean he’s very, very blunt cannot (see/ be) it’s very insulting and he carries on all kinds of mal practices thinking that he’s a rare saint ever born. You see that’s another great quality of Kali Yuga, this is the problem. They have no conscience left now to tell them that this is wrong, that is wrong they’ve killed, every where it is so.

(Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi)

You see all these five elements are very important in our body and they are the body of the chakras also as I’ve told you. So what happens that when you sing the music the vibrations can go through the musical sounds and can excite certain chakras. You see for example for the hridaya chakra (heart chakra) is very good or also for the Vishuddhi chakra it is very good. Not for all the chakras but certain chakras it does. But supposing you say a mantra that’s the sound, beautiful music and a realize soul then it is very effective, you see. For example, Ganesha you can excite him with a beautiful sloka if you are a realize soul and if your Ganesha is correct, you can excite the Ganesha of another person very easily, I mean such a person can create.

So music, sound all these things have an effect and are now using that method very extensively that supposing now we go in a mass meditation and many people are there and some chakra is caught, say Vishuddhi is caught, I can correct their Vishuddhi by just putting My finger on this, like this.

Because this has the sound, this is in the chakras, there is a micro sound which is carrying the vibrations, you see. Actually the part of the vibrations is the micro sound also, micro light, micro sound and you can say all the five elements are microed there. So when I put my finger the micro sound can tell the rest of them and the person can become cured he can do it, specially Vishuddhi, very easy to correct Vishuddhi on that. You can correct most of the things but certain things are very easy corrected.  Vishuddhi, which is responsible for the sound, made from the sound element.

As you have seen that water element is very good for treating people for the lower chakras, up to the heart chakra because the water and salt can help you for the Nabhi chakra and the salt is the earth element and what you call it is essence of the ocean and the essence of the ocean is in the Bhavasarga so we can use salt water for clearing the lower chakras.  We can use light for the eyes because, this is made out of the prakash light, light element, like that different things can be done. And with these different elements if you use them you can make all the dirt or all the obstructions, which are collected, in your particular chakra by putting them back into the same element and cleansing them out so the element takes it away.

For Mother Earth also, She has so many elements in Her that She can take away so many of your problems, which are troubling you, in your being because of some imbalance of the Mother Earth element. You see this is all due to the imbalance of these elements in you accumulated more beyond than what you want.  That’s why I said, “Extreme of it.”

Prithvi tattwa (earth element) is expressed through Shri Ganesh. Shri Ganesh is the form of a, you can say purified principle of the earth element and is the same. I mean you can say in a flute you have two notes, the first and the last are the same. In the same way in a human being the seven notes, the first one is a Ganesha and the last one is also a Ganesha, so these seven notes are the same. And these seven notes make the earth element and, are not completely the earth element but started with earth element purified then it looses its earth element problems completely. It is Parabrahma, I mean say, it becomes all Brahma, because earth element is, outside is the earth element but inside is Dhara.  Is Dhara, Dharana is the power to sustain, is the power to sustain/withstay and that power is the purest form of earth element.  So you see, that you become later on gradually the whole earth element drops out and you become that.

So it is the Dharana Shakti as they call it, the power of sustenance, is Shri Ganesha. So like that in every chakra you have a very subtle and subtle most point and that most point is the note that the Divine is playing at that point, because every note has a different frequency, a different inclination you can call it, a different sound which helps in the melody of this universe. So like that we have seven chakras and the seven notes and they’re different notes but these notes  then create permutations and combinations and that is how a charka gets into a swara, and then it becomes you can say a sound, and from a sound it becomes a word, and from word it becomes a language and like that it goes on.

And the same subtle form starts becoming something else. For example if I have love for my children that’s how I express it. I make a house for them, I make a place to live for them, I cook food for them, I make a bed for them.  You see is a gross expression of that subtle love I have. In the same way what ever is subtle within us is expressed outside by the help of the elements that are outside, to express the subtle through our gross behavior, or gross material things also we do.

So it’s the same subtle, which is expressing outside but then we become so gross later on that we forget the inner part of it.  You see for a Mother may create something, all these things and then she becomes so possessive of her children, she’ll think I’ve done so much for my children that she wouldn’t even think why she had made it. She forgets the love part of it and she becomes nothing but the gross (inaudible). She just starts scolding the children, even for breaking for a small thing here and there. You see she does this for love and then she forgets it. That’s what is an extreme behaviour. Extreme behaviour means from the subtle, you get to the gross and the gross, and the grosser. Once you become grosser you are dead.

(Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi and a question is asked)

Those who can see baddhas are on the emotional side they can see the baddhas.  They are, you see there also you can see two types of people. Those who already themselves are in baddha they can see baddhas, very clear. They can see the dead persons. Those who are already baddha can see the other person who has got a baddha because they are in the collective subconscious themselves, so they can see.  And a person, say can see the one who is a, supposing who is a drunkard. He can see. A person who is drunk can see a baddha in another person because he is in the subconscious side, you might say. But some people can achieve a state in an emotional way that they can see baddha clearly. If they are realize souls the emotional state is the state (sounds like – I said before ) the bhakti people can see baddha there.  But even the supra-conscious people can see a light coming before them. They can see somebody standing before them like a light and then say that, “There’s a light coming.” They might get fragrance or things like that can happen. You see they are called as Kunmatras is the causal principle of all the universe, causal.  Kunmatras means for earth the causal principle is fragrance. Supposing somebody has done lot of search in the field of say, earth element. So such a person can get lot of fragrance, like that.  It is a variety everywhere created because of their different searchers and because of their different seeds.

(Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi)

You see baddha, see say somebody has a baddha or not. If he has Agnya and a heart it’s definitely a baddha, and you just ask the person to put their hands towards the photograph and he starts shaking.  Normally he shakes.

(A question is asked in Hindi)

You see I don’t know how you should make it out but it’s really easy you can make out the, cannot put their eyes towards my photograph. If you ask them to close their eyes their eyes will start flickering, hands will start shaking, eyes will always flicker. (Inaudible) will show on the eyelids like this. You see baddha can be of many types. Some people just have a, for the time being, some people have permanently (inaudible), some have back (inaudible) you see.  So you just can’t

(So some one speaks to Shri Mataji.  Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.)

You just don’t worry about these things.

(Mother again speaks in Hindi)

You see the thing is people think that there’s only one type of baddha, emotional baddha.  There can be both types, a person who is very egotistical also is dominated by somebody else.  Abnormal area, abnormal behaviour you see is not a normal person can come from anywhere.
