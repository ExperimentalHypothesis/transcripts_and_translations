I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very outset we have to know, that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot describe it. It is what it has been, it will be what it is, so we must understand that, if we want to know the truth we have to go a little higher than the human awareness. At human awareness, you cannot know the truth, it’s very unfortunate. People have talked about truth, they have written books about truth, but they have not been yet able to give the truth to people. Perhaps that time human beings were not ready to achieve. In Sanskrit we have two words, one is boodha. Boodha is know the truth on your fingertips. On your central nervous system. Another word is used as “vidya” which means it should be known on your central nervous system. That means it’s not mental. As it is you know that human mind at human level is limited. So, you have to have enlightenment, your second birth. To feel the truth.

For that already there is an arrangement within us as shown here. But even if somebody talks about the centers or chakras or about shakti or anything this is just talk, talk, talk. The most important thing is to get the experience of self-realization. Moreover, whatever I am going to tell you today, you need not believe in me blindfolded. If you believe blindfolded then you will become another fanatic. You have to have the experience of feeling the kundalini coming out of your fontanel bone. Which is the actualization of this experience, of baptism. Otherwise you should not believe me. You must keep your mind open, though, like the scientist as I offer you this hypothesis. If it is truth then you have to believe as honest people. Because it is for your benevolence. It is for the benevolence of your country. It is for the benevolence of the whole world. Now those you want their benevolence should try to get their self-realization, it is logical.

As it is, in the name of God there are lots of evil forces at work. And they talk, and talk, and talk. There are misleading people, many all over the world, especially from India. And they have made lots of money by deceiving people. So, one thing you have to know that you cannot pay money for self-realization. Because it is the breakthrough, last breakthrough of your evolution.

How what did we pay for our evolution? So, one must know that God does not understand money. One has to be clear cut about what is the truth. The truth is that you are not this body, this mind. It is not that you are the body, the mind, the emotions, the intellect, ego or condition. But you are the pure spirit. Because you say this is my body, this is my mind, these are my emotions, mine, mine, mine!

But who is this mine? Who is this me? That is what you have to become. The second truth is, that there is all pervading divine power of love which does all the living work.

As you see beautiful flowers here, we take it for granted. We do not think that they are a miracle. If you ask a doctor, who runs your heart, he will say it’s the autonomous nervous system. But who is this “auto”? Science can’t answer this question. Science cannot answer many questions. Science cannot say why are you on this Earth. What is the purpose of your life. So now, there are many who are born to seek the truth in these modern times. But you should not be misled by people who just talk, talk, talk. We have had enough of talk before also.

All the problems of the world mostly come from human beings, and surprisingly all the human problems come from the centers that they have within themselves. All your physical, mental, emotional problems come from these centers, these subtle centers of energies within you. If these centers are somehow rather understood on your central nervous system, you can correct them. So, you have to have the self-knowledge. So, when this power, called “Kundalini” which is in the triangular bone of sacrum, rises, then she enlightens your centers. She integrates them and nourishes them. The bone is called “Sacrum” by Greeks, that means that knew is a sacred bone. When we talk of holiness, of sacredness, of auspiciousness it’s just words. And we get lost into nets of these words. So by reading too much also, we can get lost.

When this Kundalini rises, through these centers, first thing she does is to solve our problems. She solves our problems which are physical, mental, emotional and also spiritual. And I must tell you that Sahaja Yoga has cured many people of very incurable diseases, no doubt about it. The Russians were so much impressed that the patriarch of, that like a pope it is, the patriarch of Sankt Petersburg has invited me. He invited me to address a conference, about 300 scientists, half of them are doctors. Because you don’t have to pay for it. You can do the diagnosis on fingertips, you don’t have to go through all the rigmarole of diagnosis and all kinds of things, you just know instantaneously. Then the cure is also very simple, because if you are dealing with the fundamentals, you don’t require so many tests and things. It works out in such a miraculous way that these doctors are surprised.

The second thing that happens is that people who have suffered mentally become absolutely peaceful. Also, there are many people who suffer from anger, hatred, lust and greed. All these things just drop out. Christ has said, in the fifth chapter of Matthew that if your eye is doing sinful thing you take it out. If your right hand is doing something wrong you cut it out! It is very difficult, I think, how many Christians will be left with their hands and their eyes if they followed Christ.

Christ was too great, too pure and he didn’t know what human beings have feelings and weaknesses. I think later on Mohamad Sahib must have felt that Christ has been strict only with men and we should do something about woman also. Both of them, I think, did not know what sort of human beings they are facing.

So now, we have to understand that we have to become capable by our self-realization, to be pure followers of this great incarnations. As human beings, we cannot follow these great ideals of religion. You may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything you can commit any mistake. But once you are enlightened you cannot do anything that is wrong, that is not righteous. You just become a very good Christian, I mean the real Christian, the real Hindu, the real Muslim. You are so much changed that you cannot recognize your past. You develop a power, what we call as collective consciousness, by which you can feel the center of others, on your fingertips. You will not discuss the dress or the face or the race of a person, but you will only talk about the chakras, the centers. There are so many beautiful children born in these modern times who are already enlightened. And there are evil forces which are trying to destroy them. If the parents are enlightened they’ll understand their children much better.

Your attention also becomes enlightened. Wherever you get attention, automatically you know what is wrong with that person, or that place. Now if you know how to correct these centers and how to correct the problems sitting down here, you can change the world. Your attention becomes absolutely honest and innocent. Honest because you know the absolute truth.

While we live in a relative world, some people belong to some organizations or to some sort of an ideology, they think that they are right, and they fight and quarrel. And also they have wars. But if you have the absolute right idea about the absolute truth, then there is no question. Because everybody knows the same truth. Then what is there to fight, what is there to quarrel?

Your kundalini rises you into a personality which becomes absolutely peaceful, because you become a witness, you are no more involved in the hallucinations, but you become the witness and you see everything.

Supposing you are standing in the water and you are afraid of the waves. But if you can get onto a boat, then you can see the waves and enjoy them. And if you by the way learn how to swim, you can jump and get all the people on the boat and save them. This is exactly what happens when you have your enlightenment.

In two stages. First you become thoughtlessly aware, means you are aware but you are in the present, not in the future nor in the past, but in the present because in the present the reality is there. And reality is so beautiful. By these happening all your powers, which are potential, start manifesting. I’ve known people who have been busy with economics and have suddenly become great poets. Some musicians have become suddenly, world famous. Now look at these people from your country, they can sing such beautiful Indian songs, which is very difficult. Even in India, people have to work for so many years to be able to sing this. They even sing Sanskrit songs which are very difficult.

Apart from this you become a universal being. You transcend all these mental ideas about race, about religion, about ideologies and you jump into the ocean of truth. It all happens because you are destined, you are chosen. It’s your own power that works it. Of course, it is not for the idiots, or for stupid people. Or for people who are very frivolous. But I am surprised in modern times there are so many seekers all over the world that is unbelievable. There are so many things that happen to you that in this short lecture I won’t be able to tell you.

But you become very dynamic at the same time extremely compassioned, and your compassion works. You can raise the Kundalini of the people, you can cure them. That’s all your powers, is not the point, there are many more powers you have, which starts manifesting. You get very balanced and also extremely intelligent.

The second stage where you reach, we call it as “doubtless awareness”. Where you become absolutely mature and wise. And you develop such powers that whatever you desire works out. No evil force can catch you, and you become the source of peace for many people. Firstly, you don’t have to leave your home, your house, your family, nothing! You don’t have to stand on your heads or you don’t have to go to Himalayas. Sitting down here you get your realization. This is a special time which has been described in our scriptures thousands of years back. Even a great poet, William Blake, who was there about hundred years back in England, has said that people of God, that Godly people I should say it, will be born in these days and they will become divine. And they will have power to make others divine.

Only thing is you have to desire, you want to have your self-realization. I respect your freedom and I cannot force you to have it. This Kundalini is the power of pure desire. All our desires are not pure, because we ask for one thing then you want to ask for another, go on like that! Whether you are aware or not, this is the pure desire, is to be one this all-pervading power.

This is the knowledge of the roots and after enlightenment you become very knowledgeable. Above all, you jump into the ocean of joy. Joy is singular, it is not like happiness and unhappiness. If your ego is pampered you feel happy, if this ego is punctured you feel unhappy. But joy is an experience beyond mind. I hope you all will get your realization tonight, here. It’s like a seed when you put it in the Mother Earth it sprouts by itself. Because it is the built-in quality of the Mother Earth to sprout and also the built-in quality to the seed to get sprouted. There is no obligation. How much do we pay to Mother Earth for this? So, there is no obligation. It is your right to have this yoga, this union with the divine.

I have to tell you one thing, those who do not want to have self-realization should leave the hall. It will hardly take ten to fifteen minutes, but you should not disturb people walking about when they are going through the process of Kundalini awakening.

I think if you all move little closer would be better, little this side you are little far away.

You have to know that your innocence is in no way harmed, it’s just intact. It is covered with some clouds, of course, but it can never be destroyed. That is your essential eternal nature. It has to just manifest.

Now there are three conditions which are very simple. The first condition is that you have to forgive everyone, at this moment. You don’t have to also think about those you have to forgive. Some people say it is very difficult, but logically whether you forgive or you don’t forgive you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play in the wrong hands and torture yourself.

But worst thing that happens at this moment that your center inside of the optic chiasma is like this, absolutely constricted. If you don’t forgive it will not open at all, but if you forgive it will open and allow the Kundalini to pass. As it is you torture yourself, or your life, at this time you should forgive so you get your realization which is the most important thing.

The second thing is the center here, which is on the left side, is mostly in jeopardy in the west because they feel guilty. That means you must not feel guilty at all, you should forgive yourself. After all you are human beings and if you have done mistakes there is nothing great about it, because you are not God. So, you have to forgive yourself, whatever has happened has happened you should have faced at that moment, but no use now again killing yourself with this guilt. You don’t have to confess, you don’t have to confess, because this Kundalini which is your individual mother she knows everything about you. She knows how to correct and she’s the one who will judge you. She’ll correct you, she’ll take all the trouble upon herself. When you were born, your mother had all the pains, you were not troubled by your mother. In the same way, it works out. But if you have this problem here then you get physical problem of spondylitis, of angina and also of lethargic organs. So why carry on with this myth?

This is the second condition and the third one is that please remove your shoes. Because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

As you know there are two powers left and right. So please keep your both feet apart from each other. You be comfortable but straight. If you are sitting on the ground it’s alright, you don’t have to spread your legs. If you are sitting on the ground it’s perfectly alright.

If those people will come a little bit they can see us or you move this side a little, now. We have to use these two powers in two different ways. One is, the left one, is for the desire, the mundane desire. The desire is that you want to have your self-realization. So symbolically you put your left hand like this. And, right hand, or right side is the power of action. So, we use the right hand for nourishing our centers.

First of all, symbolically we put left hand like this and right hand on our heart. Now, in the heart resides the spirit. If you become the spirit, you become your own guide. So, you put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the center of your mastery which is created by great prophets. Now you take your hand on the left-hand side, on the low portion of your abdomen and press it hard. This is the center of the pure divine knowledge. You will know all about it later on. Then again you rise you right hand on the left-hand side of upper abdomen. Then on your heart again. Then in the corner of your neck and shoulder and put your head to your right. Then you have to take you right hand on the forehead across and please put it down, your head as far as possible. Now, please take, understand that this is the center for forgiving everyone without thinking about that. Now, take back your right hand at the backside of your head and push back your head. This is the center where without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power.

Now the last center, stretch your palm fully. And put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood.

Now please put down your head and stretch back your fingers so there is a good pressure on your scalp. Now move your scalp seven times clockwise slowly. Scalp, move scalp, not your hands over.

Now, that’s all we have to do.

And now put your right hand on your heart. Here resides the spirit. So, you have to ask me a fundamental question about yourself three times. You can call me “Mother” or Shri Mataji. So, please ask three times: Mother am I the spirit? I’ve told you if you become the spirit, you become your own guide, your own master. So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. Here you have to ask another question. Please ask three times: Mother, am I my own master?

I have told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force the pure divine knowledge on you, you have to ask for it. So, please put your right hand in the low portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here you have to ask six times because this center has got six petals. Please ask six times: Mother please give me pure divine knowledge. When you ask for pure divine knowledge, then your Kundalini starts sprouting upward. So, we have to enrich higher centers with our self-confidence.

Raise your right hand now, please, onto the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. Here you have to say with full self-confidence, ten times, Mother I am my own master.

I have already told you at the very outset, that you are not this body, this mind, this emotions, intellect, ego and conditioning, but you are the pure spirit. Now raise your right hand on your heart. Here you have to say, twelve times, with self-confidence: Mother, I am the pure spirit.

The all-pervading divine power is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of bliss, it is the ocean of joy, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you have committed, are completely dissolved in this ocean of forgiveness. But you have to forgive yourself.

So, now take your right hand in the corner of neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence: Mother, I am not guilty at all. I’ve already told that whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. At this point, at this moment, if you don’t forgive then this constricted center of Agnya won’t open, and the Kundalini won’t pass through. As it is you are tortured yourself all your life, now please at this moment forgive so that you get this great blessing of self-realization.

Without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power. Forgive everyone from your heart, not how many times.

Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Here you have to say again from your heart: Oh, divine power, if I have done any mistake, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me.

Now the last center, please stretch your palm fully. And put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Here again, I cannot force self-realization on you. So, you have to ask for it.

Now please press your scalp by pushing back your fingers and please put down your head. Now you have to move your scalp, seven times, clockwise, slowly, asking: Mother please give me self-realization, seven times.

Now please take down your hands, please open your eyes slowly. Please put both the hands towards me like this. Now put the right hand towards me like this, and now put your head down and see with your left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze, like vibrations, coming out of your own fontanel bone area.

Don’t doubt, please don’t doubt. Now please put the left hand towards me, again, bend your head and see for yourself, with the right hand, if there is a cool or hot breeze like vibrations are coming out. If they are hot that means that you have not yet forgiven. So, please forgive now, everyone.

Now, put your right hand towards me. Again, and put your head down and see with your left hand. Sometimes it is far away, sometimes closer to your head. Now, bend your heads, bend your heads.

Raise your both the hands and push your head, and ask a question, anyone of these three questions.

First one: Mother, is this the cool breeze of the holy ghost? Second one: Mother, is this the all-pervading power of divine love? Third one: Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya? Ask anyone of these questions, three times. Now please take down your hands. Now please put your hand towards me like this, little higher. All those, watch me without thinking. All those who have felt cool breeze in the fingertips or on the palm, or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

I bow to you, please take down. Now, your saintly life has started. First time you have felt this subtle power of divine love. Only thing we have to understand that in modern times, yoga is not individual, is collective. We have to become collective. So, to progress further and to grow into a great tree of Sahaja Yoga, you have to come to the collective. You may feel very much better now, very much relieved, relaxed. But you have to know your responsibility, because you have to give this to others, to spread this to others.

So first you come to collective and become masters. It hardly takes a month, I have seen. Some people become masters instantaneously. But you have to be perfect in knowledge, as to the centers, as to the Kundalini, as to the whole divine laws.

I have given more than four thousand lectures in English language. They are very subtle. So, you have to be in a state where you can understand and absorb them. So, please all of you come to collective. I’ve seen when I come there are many people, but hey get lost till I come next time. So, they remain at the same state. Then how can you help yourself, and help your country and help the whole world? I must say one thing, Russians are very quick. I never knew they were so deep. Of course, must be thirty, forty percent Russians who are not good at all. But, those who are good, are very good. I know that Czech people are very artistic and have suffered a lot, but still, you have to now develop the new art of divinity. Because you are seekers and if you do not progress you won’t be protected and you may fall into some trap of negativity. You don’t have to pay for anything, even if you come to collective you don’t have to pay. So, please try and get this knowledge, perfect it. We are not taking any money, so we don’t have very elaborate places for you. Whatever is a humble place, please come there with humility. This will help you, not me, it’s for you, not for me. So, please respect your self-realization. Thank you very much.

May God, bless you!
