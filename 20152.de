[During the evening music programme]

Shri Mataji: Hallo. [Checking the microphone]

Me and My family all visited Rome and saw the school and the children.

It was really very sweet and very loving expression of their joy that we saw there.

And Mr. Shrivastava was very much impressed by that, and he has given 11 million Italian Liras for the “Association of Culturale Sahaja Yoga”.

[Applause]

Guido: I mean, one feels really speechless in an occasion like this. And I must say already Shri Mataji has been so generous. And just imagine, last month She has donated a brand new car, a Fiat called Brava, is a new model, fully equipped with air conditioning and all the gadgets. And already we didn’t know what to say, I mean, such a generosity is, of course, always an example for all of us, and there is nothing we can do to compare it. And...

So, just from the bottom of our hearts, we can only say: Thank You, Shri Mataji. Thank you, Sir C.P. And what else? I’m running out of words!

[Applause]
