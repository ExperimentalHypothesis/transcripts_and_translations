Seeing the welcome from all of you, my heart is filled with emotion. And such a beautiful Bengali song—with such noble thoughts and feelings—after hearing all of this, it feels as though the entire world is ready for transformation, and that everywhere in India, a deep spiritual movement is taking place in the search for truth. Bengal is considered very elevated in terms of spirituality. Many lotuses have bloomed here—souls who have fragranced this beautiful environment.

Now it is the task of the Sahaja Yogis to infuse consciousness into this, to bring joy to all, to find answers to their questions, and help them achieve their goals. This can only be done by Sahaja Yogis.

We have started chasing after destructive things; our eyes have turned towards what we have seen in foreign lands. But the blood of our own country is different; its unique trait is that we are idealistic and we search only for that which is eternal. And once the eternal is found, the transient things automatically come and bow at your feet.

So, it is very important that Bengal awakens and that people attain that Supreme Principle from which the entire creation has come into being. Once that is attained, then everything becomes so effortless, so easily accessible. No matter how much is said about it, it is never enough. I hope that this awakening will happen in Bengal too, and that these children and all the people will experience the joy of the inner spirit. I have full hope for this. But Sahaja Yogis will have to work very hard, and the fruit of this hard work will be full of deep satisfaction. The greatest satisfaction is that we have given them the bliss of the Spirit (Atmananda), and those who have attained it will not want anything else—because everything else begins to bow at their feet.

I hope that all the difficulties and adversities of Bengal will be completely resolved by God's grace, and that all people will be immersed in the ocean of bliss. This is our blessing.
