Yesterday I told you about the physical side, is how to physically achieve the balance by doing all these movements and all that, and then also raising your Kundalini like that. And how to put certain chakras in places, like first of all the Muladhara it is very important. Muladhara chakra.

For that the exercise as I told you has to be, put both the feet, can you try that again? Is to put both the feet together. Now. And try to pull it towards yourself.

No, no, with this, …holding it. Yes. Towards yourself. And push the thing down. Yes.

Now, the other way round, other way round you can do it, is to push it downward, and pull, yes, with the hands, you push it down. Yes. Now. Push it up, the (inaudible) Yes, now, push it towards yourself. Again, again. Now, put it down on the sides.

Still stiff, I must say. All right, again. Now I’ll tell you, you may try another thing for this, is to put your one foot across and one foot like this. Let’s see.

Push it. Now is better that way. Now push it up. Is this one, upward. Just push it, how much you can. Push that down. Yes. Push one down, and one push up. Is better.

Now, the other one you do the same way. Push that down at the same time. Now push that up. With one hand you can push that up, one hand you can push that down. Better idea.

Now like this, like this, like this, just try. Hold it from the sides, hold it from the sides, like he’s holding.
No, no, that’s how, that put it up your hand here. Now hold it, this foot with the left hand, with the left hand. It doesn’t go that side. Like the way he is sitting. All right, it’s all right.

Ah, now, push it down, this one, and push that up. Push that up and push this down.
Now the other one you try, now the other one you try, again: can you? No, no, no, that one down, now, which one was…yes, correct, correct. Now. This is the other way. Just. Push that one down, as much as you can. Push this up.
Now you will see it will little bit open out. Now see yourself, is it opening out. Now put it, put it down again, see. Is it better now, for sitting. Better.

Now see now, is it better? Slightly. Is better now? Yes. You see, gradually it will work out. Gradually it will work out for you people. Because you are not used to it, and so at this age also it’s rather difficult. But it will work out gradually, that.
You sit like that. From now if she sits like this, you see, from the very childhood, then she can never sit like you. Can you sit like that? Let’s see, let’s see, if you can sit. Ah good, you can do it. You are good, excellent, she’s good. That’s better.

(Yogi: “They’re very supple, Mother”)

They’re supple. But you see, that’s how you grow, when you give up this habit, once you start sitting on a chair. You’ll give up the habit and then the chair becomes you see…

Children are very supple. Now then you see, this is one thing I told you how to improve your Muladhara, yesterday. All right?
Now, the second thing was about the Swadisthana.
You have to hold both the legs together, like this. Try to push it together. Now, push it like that. Hold the hands, and just turn, just try to take out the feet up…

(Laughter, Mother laughing)

He’s tall you see, that’s…
Now is alright, you turn on (the water?) like this here…With all people is rather difficult…(Laughter, Mother laughing)

That’s how, now you’ll see your Swadisthana will improve. Let’s move. See? Now let us see. Now put your hands towards Me. Let’s see, see. It improves. Swadisthana improves like that.
