[After the short Puja the bhajan “Gondhari” was sung with great joy. In the end, Shri Mataji said:]

Shri Mataji: Can you hear me?

Sahaja yogis: Yes.

Shri Mataji: I am very happy all of you are here singing the song of “Gondhari”.

Perhaps you do not know the meaning. That is, ‘We are the singers of Shri Mataji’. And these are the songs sung by people who are villagers. And they are singing this song that ‘We are singing the song of our Mother, with all our love for Her’.

And all that singing has come to you – is very, very happy for Me, because these are only ordinary villagers, and how you have picked up such a nice mood and songs from them.

May God bless you.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.

[Aside] That’s all.

[Applause]
