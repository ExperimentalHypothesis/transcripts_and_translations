After the Adi Shakti Puja, Cabella Ligure, 15 June 2003.

After the short Puja it was sung with great joy the bhajan "Gondari". In the end, Shri Mataji said:

I am very happy all of you are here singing the song of Gondari.  Perhaps you do not know the meaning.  That is ‘We are the singers of Shri Mataji’.  And these are the songs sung by people who are villagers and they are singing this song that ‘We are singing the song of our Mother, with all our love for Her’.  And all that singing has come to you – is very, very happy for Me because these are only ordinary villagers and how you have accepted such a nice mood and songs from them.

May God bless you.

Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
