 Editorial 5th May 1983 was the 14th anniversary of Sahasrara day. Sahaja Yogis of Bombay had arranged a puja to celebrate the occasion, at a place quite befitting to the siginificance of the day. It was a very beautifut spot, on Sea shore, blessed by nature-God, and not very far from, yet unaffected by, the hustle and bustle, of the metropolis. Sahaja Yogis who attended | the function were all in praise for their brothers and profusely thanked them, for sparing no efforts, in making the excellent arrangements. Those days, Bombay was the holiest of all holy places as Shri Mataji was present in person. Besides, It was the most auspicious day of opening the Sahasrara. Orthodox Indians go to the places of pilgrimage to have holy dips in the rivers, and the sea, of that place, on certain auspicious days. Sahaja-Yogi-pil grims, from the North and other Mid-land places, made the best of this opportunity to have holy dips in the Arabian Sea, that sucked all their bad vibrations and cleansed their physical and inner beings. As if, the spirit had washed the clothes of five sheaths and was, ready to worship the Supreme Goddess. Shri Mataji's biessings for the day had already reached to Sahaja Yogis all over the world, in the early hours. Those who meditated enjoyed them very much. By the time all got ready, Sahaja Yoga-Swamini, Shri Mataji arrived. She spoke in Hindi, (English translation to be published in due course). She first explained the importance of number 14, being the fourteenth anniversary. There are fourteen lokas, viz. Bhu, Bhuva, Swah. Mah, Janah, Tapah, Satyam and other seven down-wards, as also fourteen Chakras, besides seven already known, others are Hamsa, Shri, Lalita, Ardha-bindu, Bindu, Valaya and Pradakshina. At that place, Coconut trees have grown very tail and are quite inclined towards the sea, in spite of wind from the opposite direction. Shri Mataji explained. Coconut is a completely developed fruit and as it represents auspiciousness it is called, Shreephala' and our Sahasrara is like' Shreephala" having outer hard shell and hair for protection and brain inside. She advised that we should protect our Sahasrara, as a Coconut tree, firmly holds its fruits at such height. She pointed to the inclined trees and said that Coconut trees always grow along the sea Nirmala Yoga 1

 coast and those trees were becoming humble to their creator. The sca represents 'Dharma and they were bowing befare Dharma. Pleasant westerly winds, instantly carried the fragrance of Shri Mataji's presenca and message of the Puja to Sahaja Yogis all over the world. Prompt as the elements are to please the Empress of the Universe ! Shri Mataji received the Puja and blessed everybody. Sahaja Yogis absorbed the vibrations. All the environments were flooded with the vibrations. It was now getting dark. Shri Mataji walked to the sea that had considerably receded. In the sand She prepared with Her own hands an image of Shri Ganesha and vibrated it. She worshipped Shri Ganesha. The star which follows Her everywhere was twinkling alone on the pinkish looking horizon, just above Her. As She was looking towards the sea, it started rising again. Waves were seen rising far away. Slowly they advanced and came neater. They receded for a while and again came and again receded, like a child playing with its mother; trotting, towards her and going away. Mother appreciatively walked further tew- steps towards the sea, and lo! Waves came one after another; they were rushing, but came closer gently and washed Her feet. Then further advanced and touched the image of Shri Ganesha but not beyond; lest the picture be defaced. Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai' resounded the shore. Then they stayed on till Shri Mataji was there. It was a memorable day. Weather was unusually pleasant and so it remained during the days Shri Mataji was in Bombay. Wind was pleasant throughout the day. The Sun was shining but it was not hot even in the afternoon. It shows how the elements are devoted and loving before the Mother. This gives rise to one question; should we not follow their example ? She is their mother too, but how modest, humble, and loving they are, never complaining but always pleasing. Should we not emulate the attitude, of those Coconut trees; of going back to the source and protecting and developing Sahasrara? Shri Mataji, we all the Sahaja yogis of the world desire Your good health. Shri Mataji, we all the Sahaja Yogis of the world pray that Your forthcoming tour to U.S.A., Canada and other countries be a Grand Success.

 Sahasrara Chakra Hanuman Road, New Delhi 4th Feb. 1983 Today, I will be telling you about the last So our brain is doing right side activity and centre of Sahasrara. So this last centre, the that's why our brain is like 'Shreephal'. Sahasrara, is contained in the limbic area of the brain. Our head is like a coconut. The coconut has the hair, and then a hard nut and the six Chakras and is a hollow space, on the then a black covering and inside is white shell sides of which there are one thousand Nadis of coconut and inside is the space, the water. In the same way, our brain is made. That's into the limbic area, then the enlightenment why coconut is called as "Shreephal"". It is of these Nadis takes place and you can see the fruit of the power. that is, Shree. Shree power is the right side power and the left side and these flames have all the seven colours power is the Lalita power. So, we have two that you see in the VIBGYOR. But the last Chakras-left side, here, is the Lalita and the one, ultimately becomes again integrated and right-side, here, is the Shree Chakra. These two Chakras are working out the right side lights ultimately become crystal clear. Mahasaraswati's power and left side Maha- kali's power. Now, the central power is the Kundalini that has to rise and penetrate through different Chakras, enter into the limbic area and enlighten the seven Pithas-seats of these seven Chakras. So, it penetrates through six Chakras, enters into the iimbic area, enligh- tens all the seven Pithas in the brain, which are placed along the mid-line of the limbic many nerves in every bundle of nerves. So. area. So, we start from the back, is placed here, at the back, is the Mooladhar Chakra, around it is the Swadishthan, then is the Nabhi, then the Heart, then the Vishuddhi and enlightenment of the Kundalini takes place in then the Agya. So, all these six centres are the brain, then the truth is perceived through combining to make the seventh centre. This your brain. That's why it is called as 'Satya- is very important point which we should know khand', means you start seeing the truth Now, the Shree Chakra is right side working perceived by your brain because so far what & Lalita Chakra is left side working. So, when the Kundalini does not rise then we do with truth. What you see, is just the outer side, our right side our physical and mental activities say, you can see the colours. You can see Sahasrara is actually is the assemblage of (NERVES). And when the light penetrates them as flames, very gentle flames burning it is a crystal clear flame. All these seven So, you have Sahasrara with one thousand petals, as they call it, but if you cut the brain in a transverse section or horizontal section, you will be able to see that all these nerves are bullt like this along the limbic area, all of them are like the petals, and if you cut it like this, (vertically) you will find that there are when it is enlightened, you can see Sahasrara as a burning bundle of flames. It is a very deep subject. So, when the ever you see through your brain, is not the Nirmala Yoga

But you cannot say whether this carpet has been used also means Mary, Marium. Because it means by some saint. You cannot say whether this is made by a devil or a divine person. You in Sanskrit language. It's called 'Niranand' cannot say that this gentleman, is he a good in the brain. person or he is an evil person. You cannot say if this Deity has come out of the mother Earth or not. Also, you cannot say about any person, who is your relation, whether he is a good relation or a bad relation or what sort of from, that you see on your fingers. First you a person he is, whether he goes to wrong people or to the right people, whether he has know what Chakras, what fingers are catching connections with wrong side or with good with your attention, Then with your brain you side, Here, go you do not know anything about divinity with your mind. Nothing-it is impossible for you to judge a person about his divinity unless and until the Kundalini reaches at least this my family I am called as Neera. And 'Neera marine. Neera is water. "Neer" means water And, this stage ultimately unfolds. First what you know is the Satya, is the Truth- what is this another gentleman is suffering see your fingers. With your attention, you can depict what centres it is catching. Because, if you say this finger, that does not mean it is Vishuddhi Chakra. But your brain can say that it is Vishuddhi. And that depicts it that this fellow is suffering from the troubles of the Vishuddhi Chakra. But still it is rational. od means Divine. So actually part, which is the limbic area. You cannot make out whether a person is real or not, Because, you see what finger it catches and whether a Guru is real or not. Because then you say. divinity cannot be perceived through your the Sahasrara unfolds itself mare, you don't brain, unless & until this light of your Spirit have to think about it, you just say it. Then shines into it. But when the Satyakhand or there is no difference between your Chitta (ATTENTION) and your Sat (TRUTH). The Now, the Spirit is expressed in the heart, enlightened Chitta (ATTENTION) and the is reflected in the heart. The centre of the enlightened brain become one. There is no Spirit, we can say, is in the heart. But problem at all for such person. There is no actually, the seats of Spirit is above here above the head and that is the Spirit of what anything on the fingers and then depict it we call of the God Almighty, say whom you call Parvardigar, you call him Sadashiva or you can call Him the Rahim and you can call Him by many names which are said about the Lord who is God Almighty Niranjan, they call Him it is there. Nirankar, every sorts of words which start with 'Nir', "Nihi'. Now, at every centre in the body you receive a different type of joy. with, as I said, Chitta (Attention). Then when, Every centre has a different type of joy. And, it gets absolutely integrated with the Spirit, there are names for every type of joy you receive at every centre when the Kundalini say, it is so. That is how, this brain unfolds rises: But when the Kundalini comes into the Sahasrara, then the joy you receive is called truth through logical conclusions. Because, as 'Niranand. Niranand! The 'Ni means- nothing else but Anand (Joy). Niranand ! need to see, on the fingers, no need to say through the brain which you have learnt in Sahaja Yoga, that if you find something wrong here, it means Agya-that is not necessary ! You just say, Agya. And you just say it and Then, it unfolds more. First it is integrated then whatever you say, is the truth. You just into 3 new dimensions. First, it depicts the I have told you that if this finger is catching then it is Vishuddhi. And then, you ask the Nirmala Yoga 4.

 person "Have you got the problem, here ?". books. And though people have told thal He says, "Yes", Then, you believe in Me and first see the vibrations and then read the then you believe, that this is the Vishuddhi books, still we say, 'O what's wrong, we Chakra, which is showing, is true. This is the should read other books' You go down on logical conclusion, in a way, that you have snake and ladder as I've said. That is one of experimented, you are seeing and still doubt- the snakes. We think that what's the need ing whether Mother says is true or not. And then, you are sure, "Yes, it is so, we have thing, that thjng' You do not progress. seen that this is Vishuddhi Chakra". So, the truth becomes logically acceptable to this brain. But still, there is the brain working out there are some very gross people in Sahaja on its gross level. to do meditation, I have no time, I have this The other point which is very gross. Also, Yoga who enter into it. Doesn't matter. But first thing you must know 'you have to be In the second stage, as I told you. where honest, 'very honest in Sahaja Yoga'. The you believe, you know for definite that this means Vishuddhi Chakra,, no doubt about it. Then we say that 'Nirvikalpa" has started, just crawl into it without having any self- when there is no doubt about Me or Sahaja respect, without having any understanding as Yoga. But then, the newunfolding starts within you. For that, one has to do medita- They will bring all their family, come down tion. In humility, one has to do meditation. And then also, for this new dimension, when paving money which should be paid, for your Chitta (ATTENTION) itself becomes merged into your brain or into the enlightened brain, for that, one has to, very honestly and humbly surrender to Sahaja Yoga. honesty is like-I have seen people. If we have a dinner, say for a marriage-party, they will to, who is going to pay for all these things ? and sit down. There are people who avoid Sahaja yoga. Supposing, they are eating food or they are travelling or they are coming from abroad, they have to pay money for their travelling, for their food And, sometimes, you know I have to pay lot of money. Doesn't matter, I don't mind. But it's not good for you. The main thing is that it's not good for you. So, how you behave towards Sahaja yoga as far as money is concerned, is also very impor- tant, though it looks gross. But it can give a Now, what do we do when we get our vibrations. We have different-different reac- tions. Some people do not even understand the value of vibrations. Some people try to learn what it means. And some people, sud- denly think, "O, now they are realised souls, they can, go on giving realisations, this, that'. big trouble in the unfoldment because of the They go on a ride of a ego-trip. When they go on a ride of a ego-trip, they find that they have failed and they have then to come back, from the very beginning they start. It is like the game of of Snake & Ladder. So, treaction to vibrations should be very humble, receptive reaction. Nabhi catching-and, as you know, if the Nabhi catches it can spread upto the whole of void; and if the void is catching, Ekadasha rudra, which is placed here, the destructive forces, built-in. So, before coming to Sahaja Yoga, it was alright, you were doing all kinds of things and you would have smoothly gone to hell without any difficulty. It is very easy to go to hell the Father in it. So, if we commit any sins You can take two running jumps and go to hell. The rest of it you should see. But going to hell is the easiest thing. For that. you Now, on the gross level, because as I have told you that the brain is the one which holds against the Father, then this unfoldment in the brain takes some time. So, we start reading Nirmala Yoga

 don't have to work hard or do anything about what about you doing something that helps it. But, when you are ascending, when you are rising, then it is little difficult. You have to be the Sahasrara is very important: careful that you should not falter, you should not fall and that you are ascending. So, you have to be alert about yourself that you are not falling into the same habits which you level where there is, I mean, at the point, had. you to open your Sahasrara. So, opening of Now, surprisingly, it is so placed that Sahasrara has got the Brahmarandhra at the where there is the Heart-OChakra. So, we must know that Brahmarandhra is directly connected to your heart If it is not done from the heart, superficially done Sahaja Yoga, you can not Some people have a habit of saving money at the cost of Sahaja Yoga. Some have a habit of making money at the cost of Sahaja go very high. You have to put the full heart Yoga, Some people have the habit of not giving the due amount-and like that. It's something like cheating. They all go out of the Sahaja Yoga in no time. They may be looking like great leaders in the beginning but people also, are, what Christ calls as, 'murmur- they go out just like that and many a times ing souls'. He said that, be careful about these people tell me 'why don't you keep a proper murmuring souls-those who go on murmuring account and all that. But in Sahaja Yoga, behind and taking advantage as if they are I'm not supposed to keep any accounts or anything. Because, my accountants are Sahaja yogis. If you try to play tricks with Sahaja Yoga, immediately you are pushed out; in your dangerous when you enter into the kingdom awareness, in your Nabhi Chakra you never had-you may make thousands of rupeeshere, but you will lose thousands of rupees, You kingdom, you are punished. But in the God's might get into troubles. You will have any Kingdom, it's so blissful, absolutely blissful, kind of a problem that I cannot tell and then complete blessings are poured on, absolutely. you will say how did I get this problem. So with everything-health, wealth, mental, emo- Nabhi Chakra if you are not honest in your seeking. Honesty of seeking not only means I want to seek". It also means what your much blessed, you are also forgiven and behaviour is, towards yourself and towards forgiven, and forgiven, and there's a long rope others. You have to be honest to yourself, that you sit down for meditation, try to improve your Antar-Yoga try to make your Thoughtless Awareness, this feeling of thought- lessness, wider and wider. Try to achieve that dishonest with Sahaja, Yoga have to be very state where you really feel thoughtless. So the careful; please don't do it. If you don't like to be honesty pays and you rise higher and higher. in Sahaja Yoga, you better go away, it is better; deeper and deeper into your own being. First from your point of view and from our point of you depend upon Me that, "after all, Mother view also, Because, in case you are dishonest, is going to do everything. When I went to you are trying to play tricks and games, and Mother, my Sahasrara opened out. This thing you suffer and you look funny and strange; happened, then this thing happened". But then people will say, that what's wrong with that is the main thing. Like, people they come to Sahaja Yoga and they are murmuring behind, "This could have been like that, that could have been like that", all those things. All such trying to save others. All such people also, can suffer a lot. Because, they are doing a double game. And such a double game, is very of God. Any kingdom you are member of. any kingdom, if you are treacherous to that tional-all kinds of prosperity you can get in Sahaja Yoga, no doubt. But when you are so given to you to hang yourself. But you really hang fully. It's not half way. So, those people, who think, they can be Nirmala Yoga 6.

 Sahaja yoga ? So we will unnecessarily suffer, within us, built by two types of sins we Because, we cannot show you in the mirror, commit. If wwe bow our heads to wrong type that this man has been very very disloyal. We of gurus and submit ourselves to their viscious cannot show that! So, it will bring a bad name to us-first of all. And secondly, you will be harmed, by this kind of a thing. If you If you have bowed because I've never are harmed, then also we will have a bad name that how could it happen. But if you are honest about Sahaja yoga and about your God, then the problem comes on this side seeking. you don't know how much God of the thing, on the right side. If you have, looks after you.

 donot recognise it, your Sahasrara can not be wrong gurus, if they have reached the right opened because, this is the time when the conclusion and surrender themselves to Sahaja Sahasrara was opened and you have to have Yoga, accepting their mistakes and saying that your realisation. It is very important thing that that you 'have' to recognise Sahaja Yoga. There are many people who say that 'Mother, above all, I don't believe in God. who is God, why to believe in Sahaja Yoga this way, we can just call you just 'Mother' you could be anything against God or prophets is the same my Mother', Alright, doesn't matter. But you -anti God personality who talks like that can't get your realisation. And, even if you develops the problems, gets alright if he get it, you cannot retain it. You have to recognise; RECOGNITION is the 'enly' wor- Yoga as the only way of entering into the ship of Sahaja Yoga Recognition is the only worship when you want to know God in Sahaja Yoga. All the other Ganas, Devatas, Deities, Shaktis, are one in unison in Sahaja Yoga. And, anyone who does not recognise Sahaja Yoga, they just are not bothered about you, what sort of a person you are. For example, a man who worships Shiva, he comes to me, and, I find his heart is catching-Sur- prising ! He says. "Mother, I worship Shiva, how is it, my heart is catching 7". I said, "you have to recognise Sahaja Yoga. Just ask and this star is the one which has brought Shiva". And when he asked the questions to cancer-disease because, Pluto is the one, that Shiva, then only the vibrations started flowing. So, Sahasrara takes charge that it makes you recognise and also, it convinces you, it proves limbic area. Even those who have been to "I'm my own Guru', they can be cured. And those, who have been speaking that 1 am I don't believe in any prophets or anything- humbles down himself and accepts Sahaja superconsciousness'. I have seen people who have been Tantrikas, are being saved. I've seen people who have done all kinds of wrong things have been saved. Those people, who were members of very funny, strange organisations have been saved. But it is very difficult to convince anyona that whatever they are doing has been wrong and they should come to right path. So, a star came to play its part with Pluto, cures cancer, or all such diseases which are incurable. So, those people who just go head-long into wrong path, suffer from funny to you. And by this proving. even if you are type of heart troubles, palpitations, insomnia, vommiting, giddiness, all sorts of, we can say irrelevant talking. It is a very serious thing to go to a wrong guru and bow to him. Sahasrara partly-they take liberties, they behave in a becomes a closed area for such a person. funny manner-without understanding that The persons who are against Sahaja Yoga, Who is this 'Person' who is here ? I've seen have a very strong Sahasrara, like a nut, in the sense that it is such a strong shell that putting their hand up, raising Kundalini; they you can not just break it-the strong shell, like a thick nut Even if you want to use a hammer, Because, if you have recognised, then you not recognising. then you cannot get your realisation. But those who recognise also, recognise many a times, I'm talking, people are just are just talking, chit chatting-I'm surprised. you cannot break it. should know whom you are facing. Because, It is not for My good; I'm not going to lose u anything. But only you, in your ascent have not recognised. That shows that you have not yet recognised. Today, the time has conme, that you have to recognise Sahaja Yoga; you have to. You did not recognise any saint any prophets, any- one, any incarnation. But today, the condi- tion is that, you have to recognise one. If you And the way some people monopolise Me Nirmala Yoga 8.

You can not do But for this, the strength comes from also, "Samartha' means powerful personality So, you develop that powerful personality So, this is the simplest way of achieving which has no temptations, which has 'no your higher thing is by recognising gradually wrong ideas, which has 'no' catches, 'no' and recognising gradually. It is very difficult problems. to tell anybody if something is wrong with that person-impossible. After Sahaja Yoga, I can tell you, this Chakra is catching, that tricks are really harming themselves, not Chakra is catching. But also because you Sahaja Yoga.

It is not rare that Shri Mataji starts a state- ment by saying: "you will be amazed.." In Paris we were amazed to witness, once more, how truly amazing our Mother is; how, in a leisurely way, and, so to say, jokingly, She was handling so many situations, people and universes at the same time. On Saturday, 18th June, we had a Havan in the garden of the ashram and a puja. Thereafter the weather changed completely from cold-moody-cloudy to sunny and warm. A gentle breeze started fanning the branches of the trees and, on Sunday, we enjoyed the garden of Eden, laying around, chatting, everybody floating in the oneness of friendship, vibrations and gaiety. There was so much love around to give and take : We were bathing in the aura of Her PREM, of Her Divine Love, And, surely, God enjoyed that His children were enjoying themselves so much. never quite know which one.

 Place of money in Sahaja Yoga Sri Mataji has many times said that God thing is certain, is that according to vibrations does not understand money. This means the money is a human invention, an artifice, a means of tricking reality. What are Sahaja God Almighty. Then why should we question? Yogis to do with such poisonous stuff ? Does it mean we should get rid of it as quickly as possible ? Or give it to someone else (our the one for which it was collected. For them, Guru perhaps) ? Or pretend we haven't got money was to be used in a particular any with us ? What to do, is the problem. Many people feel that the sensible thing to do with money is to live a normal life and our Mother wants the money to pay for spend only what is spare for Sahaja Yoga. something else ? What is wrong? They also feel that what is spent should be, at least partly, under their control and approval. petty about money and its use, we will remain Having parted with it, they still do not want petty-hearted people.

While some green black clouds were still rolling over my head, I was given the most beautiful of all rainbows, shaped like horseshoe, stretching its colours from one side to the other of the Canyon. It was just too much. I felt the Universe was a house and I was the heir of this household. I did not feel after.

I did not know either, by the way. that the shape of the horseshoe or "bandhan" instead of siding with negativity. I take here is the symbol of the Adi Shakti. But I felt :1 the liberty of quoting a few lines of this extra- heard a call, I felt a great, great, tremendous ordinary letter which saved my (spiritual) life love, Her Love upon me. for the second time: Rajesh and I met again in Berkeley. He showed me a picture of Shri Mataji. A few days later, in U.K., at the appointed time, I found myself standing in the hall of Shri Mataji's house, ready for "my first encounter of the Atma kind". "Now the time has come to tell you that Sahaja Yoga cannot work unless and until you completely surrender to "Me" without any more questioning. This "Me" means Mataji Nirmala Devi who resides on the "Sahasrara" of the VIRATA; This is the absolute truth whether you like it or not, whether your ego and super ego accept in or not. I am sorry I have to confess it." Needless to say, later on, in moments of confusion, the recollection of these signals comforted my still vacillating faith in Sahaja Yoga. Each of us who know to search his memory has a provision of such signals before his realisation, before meeting Shri Mataji or, simply, before meeting Sahaja Yogis.

You perhaps do not realize that all the Deities who reside in you and who are controlled in your Sahasrara are not at all interested in people who are not completely surrendered to me. I do not know how to convince them. They only look after those who take my name and accept that I am the Adi Shakti. This is the only way you can progress. What can I do ? Even the people who are cured by me have to keep the protocol otherwise the Deities sleep and they go back to their previous position. Fixing the pole of the tent When I left England I was eager to share the good news with others who I thought to be seekers. So, I briefed one of my friends who had much more experience of these things than myself as he had tried so many gurus in India and elsewhere. He was keeping the pictures of the various special maste:s he had met, stones they had given him and also a sort of mental decoding system whereby he could find out who was a genuine master and who wasn't. Despite this background however or, rather, because of it, he failed to grasp the point of Sahaja Yoga, passed on to me a few of his exotic-esoteric bhoots and got me quite confused. I then wrote a letter to Shri Mataji in which 1 expressed doubts as to how I could possibly be so deeply transformed through Sahaja Yoga and how could this yoga trans- form the world. I was drifting away. So far 1 have not said this to anyone because I thought there was no need. Those who were wise realised it and those who are foolish have lost their chance in Sahaja Yoga." I was stunned ! I somehow realised at once what these lines were meant to carry.

So he saw a ray of light. Quietly he slip- ped inside the church hall when nobody was there and began his show of juggling before the statue of Mother Mary. At last he was on his own again, completely in his elements. Reverent and immaculate as if playing in front of a royal audience, he proceeded step by site timing. He threw the balls one by one, with gay abandon, then with equal deftness out patterns in the empty space, his body twisting and turning in rhythm with the balls weaving kaleidoscopic variety, his trained hands quest- ing in the vaccum for the balls dancing in Amidst this galaxy of luminaries, this humble juggier felt awkward, embarrassed and the air, his face swathed in streaming sweat, even, in a way, guilty.

He froze with fear and hung his head low. As one of the members began to reprimand him for his almost blasphemous behaviour in front of Mother, the statue of His anguish was great and genuine. His burning desire to please Mother ultimately led him to a very touching but unorthodox solu- tion.

 An Experience Almost a year ago, in May 1982, I started to anything like this before. I was nervous to notice beautiful photographs of an Indian lady all over Brighton. In passing I read: but definitely excited. In fact there was a great air of excitement in the whole room, and it kept mounting as "She unites the essence of all religions. Awakens the dormant spiritual energy gradually people arrived. an introductory talk was given and we sat waiting for Shri Mataji's arrival. The excitement built up more and more until .. suddenly everyone was hurrying to their feet, turning to the back of the hall and........ 'what presence, what joy, what within us all.

It seemed a bit inside my stomach and the joy rushed through strange to see so many people sitting with and I burst into smiles and laughter.

I didn't want to go away. When finally did leave to go home through the Saturday night streets, I sank down in my chair.

 full of crowds of rowdy drunks, I clearly saw what a hell surrounds us, but I was no longer afraid. I'd never heard about it before ? Why wasn't it in all the papers ? Why wasn't it on the television news ? Even now it sometimes seems incredible. The next aternoon they had invited me to go to a Sahaj Yoginis house to see a video of Shri Mataji.

5th May 1983 was the 14th anniversary of Sahasrara day. Sahaja Yogis of Bombay had
arranged a puja to celebrate the occasion, at a place quite befitting to the siginificance of
the day. It was a very beautifut spot, on Sea shore, blessed by nature-God, and not very far
from, yet unaffected by, the hustle and bustle, of the metropolis. Sahaja Yogis who attended
| the function were all in praise for their brothers and profusely thanked them, for sparing no
efforts, in making the excellent arrangements.
Those days, Bombay was the holiest of all holy places as Shri Mataji was present in person.
Besides, It was the most auspicious day of opening the Sahasrara. Orthodox Indians go to
the places of pilgrimage to have holy dips in the rivers, and the sea, of that place, on certain
auspicious days. Sahaja-Yogi-pil grims, from the North and other Mid-land places, made
the best of this opportunity to have holy dips in the Arabian Sea, that sucked all their bad
vibrations and cleansed their physical and inner beings. As if, the spirit had washed the
clothes of five sheaths and was, ready to worship the Supreme Goddess. Shri Mataji's
biessings for the day had already reached to Sahaja Yogis all over the world, in the early
hours. Those who meditated enjoyed them very much.
By the time all got ready, Sahaja Yoga-Swamini, Shri Mataji arrived. She spoke in Hindi,
(English translation to be published in due course). She first explained the importance of
number 14, being the fourteenth anniversary. There are fourteen lokas, viz. Bhu, Bhuva,
Swah. Mah, Janah, Tapah, Satyam and other seven down-wards, as also fourteen Chakras,
besides seven already known, others are Hamsa, Shri, Lalita, Ardha-bindu, Bindu, Valaya
and Pradakshina.
At that place, Coconut trees have grown very tail and are quite inclined towards the sea, in
spite of wind from the opposite direction. Shri Mataji explained. Coconut is a completely
developed fruit and as it represents auspiciousness it is called, Shreephala' and our
Sahasrara is like' Shreephala" having outer hard shell and hair for protection and brain inside.
She advised that we should protect our Sahasrara, as a Coconut tree, firmly holds its fruits
at such height.
She pointed to the inclined trees and said that Coconut trees always grow along the sea

 coast and those trees were becoming humble to their creator. The sca represents 'Dharma
and they were bowing befare Dharma.
Pleasant westerly winds, instantly carried the fragrance of Shri Mataji's presenca and
message of the Puja to Sahaja Yogis all over the world. Prompt as the elements are to
please the Empress of the Universe ! Shri Mataji received the Puja and blessed everybody.
Sahaja Yogis absorbed the vibrations. All the environments were flooded with the vibrations.
It was now getting dark. Shri Mataji walked to the sea that had considerably receded. In
the sand She prepared with Her own hands an image of Shri Ganesha and vibrated it. She
worshipped Shri Ganesha. The star which follows Her everywhere was twinkling alone on
the pinkish looking horizon, just above Her. As She was looking towards the sea, it started
rising again. Waves were seen rising far away. Slowly they advanced and came neater.
They receded for a while and again came and again receded, like a child playing with its
mother; trotting, towards her and going away. Mother appreciatively walked further tew-
steps towards the sea, and lo! Waves came one after another; they were rushing, but came
closer gently and washed Her feet. Then further advanced and touched the image of Shri
Ganesha but not beyond; lest the picture be defaced. Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai'
resounded the shore. Then they stayed on till Shri Mataji was there.
It was a memorable day. Weather was unusually pleasant and so it remained during the days
Shri Mataji was in Bombay. Wind was pleasant throughout the day. The Sun was shining
but it was not hot even in the afternoon. It shows how the elements are devoted and loving
before the Mother. This gives rise to one question; should we not follow their example ?
She is their mother too, but how modest, humble, and loving they are, never complaining
but always pleasing. Should we not emulate the attitude, of those Coconut trees; of going
back to the source and protecting and developing Sahasrara?
Shri Mataji, we all the Sahaja yogis of the world desire Your good health.
Shri Mataji, we all the Sahaja Yogis of the world pray that Your
forthcoming tour to U.S.A., Canada and other countries be a Grand Success.

for the second time:
Rajesh and I met again in Berkeley. He
showed me a picture of Shri Mataji. A few
days later, in U.K., at the appointed time, I
found myself standing in the hall of Shri
Mataji's house, ready for "my first encounter

Needless to say, later on, in moments of

Fixing the pole of the tent
When I left England I was eager to share
the good news with others who I thought to
be seekers. So, I briefed one of my friends who
had much more experience of these things
than myself as he had tried so many gurus in
India and elsewhere. He was keeping the
pictures of the various special maste:s he had
met, stones they had given him and also a
sort of mental decoding system whereby he
could find out who was a genuine master and
who wasn't. Despite this background however
or, rather, because of it, he failed to grasp the
point of Sahaja Yoga, passed on to me a few
of his exotic-esoteric bhoots and got me quite
confused. I then wrote a letter to Shri Mataji
in which 1 expressed doubts as to how I could
possibly be so deeply transformed through
Sahaja Yoga and how could this yoga trans-
form the world. I was drifting away.
So far 1 have not said this to anyone
because I thought there was no need.
Those who were wise realised it and those
who are foolish have lost their chance in
Sahaja Yoga."
I was stunned ! I somehow realised at
once what these lines were meant to carry.
The 25 September 1975 Shri Mataji was
gracious enough to send me a letter in which Mataji's real identity was not true the whole

An appeal to all Sahaja Yogi brothers and sisters of the world
Dear Brothers and Sisters.
Some of us are fortunate enough to hear Her Holiness Shri Mataji
in person whenever She talks to us in our area on the various aspects of
Sahaja Yoga.
It is fitting, therefore, to transcribe them from the original tapes in
your possession for the benefit of all the Sahaja Yogis Many Sahaja Yogis
who are already contributing them have expressed that they are immensely
benefited while actually transcribing it and understand the various aspects
explained by Mother in detail. Besides one gets plenty of vibrations.
May we, therefore, request you to give a helping hand in this
important task of spreading the Mother's Message.
The transcribed copies may please be sent to :
