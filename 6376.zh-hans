俄国圣彼得堡霎哈嘉瑜伽医学会议

1995年9月20日

〔是次会议由Petrovskaya俄国科学及文学研究院主办,锡吕‧玛塔吉女士是该研究院唯一的女性名誉会员。〕

锡吕‧玛塔吉女士:我向所有从心中追求平安的人致敬,如果人们只是表面的追求和平,那我也没有办法。但我们看见这些战争为我们的国家及有关的国家带来如此灾难,我们便应该认真的思考一下和平。

我不反对任何宗教。所有宗教来到世上,都是同一棵灵性树上的花朵。但人们摘下那些花朵,然后为那些死去的花朵而争斗,说..「这是我的,这是我的。」在第二次世界大战以后,开始了一种以神的名义发动的新型战争。如果你相信只有一个神,怎可能去战斗?因此他们所有的只是一种思想上的理念,而不是在心中有真正的信心。没有宗教教导仇恨,但现实却往往相反。据我所知,在开始时所有宗教都是以最纯洁的形式来到世上,希望为这个世界带来爱心、平安和团结。但渐渐有些人「执掌」了这些宗教。开始时他们也是好好的,但渐渐地他们各自分开。不仅宗教之间分崩离析,甚至在每一宗教内部,也分成许多不同的派别。无论他们实际怎样,但至少他们在人间创造了一种道德感。他们谈道德,也谈爱心与慈悲。他们成立了许多机构,来鼓吹这种想法,但都只是表面的。你们看那些自称为基督徒、回教徒相印度教徒的人,他们是真的吗?他们是真正的基督徒吗?耶稣基督说:「你们不要有淫邪的眼睛。」你们见过基督徒没有或从没有淫邪的眼睛的吗?穆罕默德说:「除非你知道自己的真我,否则你不能知道神。」真我(Self)的意思是永恒的灵(Spirit)。他们有多少人曾经尝试追寻?所有这些回教徒,他们是否有尝试追求灵性。他们只是在斗争,到处斗争。我很为他们难过,因为成千上万的人、就这样被杀掉。他们被推动去战争,被鼓励去战争,许多都愚蠢地死去,他们被彻底的屠杀。

我问一个俄国人:「为甚么你们有车臣的战争?」他说:「我们是一个民主国家,在一个民主国家里,怎可能有一个邦是建立在宗教之上的呢?」听起来合情合理,十分合乎逻辑。但你们知道英国也只有一个宗教吗?那便是英国的圣公会。据说天主教的大女儿是法国,而在西班牙,除了天主教会外,别无其地。而在这里,除了正统教会以外,就没有其他。无论他们做了多少好事,都给他们的所作所为扯平了,因为他们都不跟从宗教所要求的那样做。

如果你想知道那些回教徒是怎样的,问那些犹太教教徒吧。如果你想知道那些犹太教教徒是怎样的,问那些基督徒吧。如果你想知道那些基督徒是怎样的,你最好到美洲去,看看他们曾经做过些甚么。那些基督徒是公然地极之不道德的人。今天我偶然看见一段俄国的电影,比美国电影还要坏。片中有个近乎全裸的女郎,就好像美国的女孩子一样,不知羞耻,完全没有道德。耶稣基督有教人不道德吗?祂有谈到娼妓吗?在西方,甚至连家庭主妇也表现得像娼妓一样,这是我亲眼看见的,她们完全不尊重自己的贞洁。现在所有那些美国的破烂货都到了这里来,因为他们在本土卖不出去,而你们则不假思索便买下那些破烂货。你们被吸引到西方那种不道德的生活方式,你们如何作基督徒?

回教徒也一样,他们宣称回教是一个伟大的,教导道德的宗教。穆罕默德甚至有谈到基督和他母亲的贞洁。但如果你看那些回教徒,他们有时比基督徒更坏。有一次我从印度维也特(Riyadh)到伦敦去,途中睡着了。我醒来的时候,发现本来穿着亚拉伯服饰的男女,都换了新鲜时尚的衣服。那些无耻的女子穿着可耻的衣服,像个美国女郎,而那些男子也穿上可怕的服装,像个小丑。他们都饮酒、抽烟,在飞机上大跳的士高舞。于是我问那位戴着面纱的空中小姐:「飞机中途有停过站吗?」她说:「没有。」于是我说:「他们是同一班人吗?为甚么会变成这样?」他们说:「你到伦敦去看看,便曾明白。」他们饮酒,比苏格兰人还厉害。由于我丈夫的工作,我们经常参加派对,我丈夫从不饮酒,他们便称他为「回教徒」,其他人则饮酒如故。

基督教失败了、回教失败了,这是毫无疑问的。用勉强的方法,不可能带来道德。这是我所看见的。我碰见过一些英国人,我问他们说:「为甚么你们经常这样看女人?」他们说:「我们很享受。」我说:「那耶稣基督呢?」他们说:「我们甚至在教堂也这样做。我们要将眼睛固定在某物之上吗?」我说:「那是可以办到的。你们都不是基督徒,不是回教徒,不是犹太教徒。你们都是些没有希望的坏蛋。」他们说:「母亲,我们应该怎么办?」:我问他们说:「你们是真理的追求者吗?抑或你们只想依循你们那些旧有的固定观念,抱着某些东西不放,然后认为我们是基督徒,我们已经得救,我们是回教徒,我们已经得救,我们是犹太教徒,我们已经得救。坦白说,你们大多数人都会落入地狱。他们说:「为甚么?」我说:「因为你们都是些伪君子。现实上你们从不追随自己的宗教,你们只是戴着一些标签。」

我曾经看人们在基督教的教堂打架,在回教的圣殿打架,在犹太教的圣堂打架。试想从亚伯拉罕到摩西,从摩西到耶稣基督,然后到穆罕默德,这是一步一步前进的过程。甚至回教徒的戒律也不是属于他们的,因为它不是来自可兰经,而是来自圣经,在杰里迈亚书,摩西颁布给犹太人的。但犹太人说不,我们不会接受,那是太多了。然后那些基督徒说,不,我们也不能接受。但那些回教徒说可以,我们可以接受。由此可见摩西时代的犹太人是如何彻底的腐败。但接受了这些,对任何人有帮助吗?如果他们相信一个抽象无形的神,尤其是那些回教徒,为甚么他们要为任何国家或土地而争斗?神是无所不在的。有一点很重要,在任何国家,如俄国,任何人,你要先知道自己是俄国人,如果有谁先想自己是回教徒或基督教徒,他们便会斗争。因为他们都运用政治的头脑,而不是灵性上的头脑。你们要有灵性上的头脑,否则你要承认你不相信神。如果你相信神,便应该有灵性上的取向。我所见过的也许比你们为多。

现在争论的双方是西方文化和原教旨主义(fundamentalist)的文化。原教旨主义者认为应该有很严厉的文化。他们使用强逼的办法。在阿尔及利亚,成千上万的人只因穿着像个西方人而被杀。那些原教旨主义者在巴黎放置炸弹,他们参予各种暴力活动。穆罕默德有谈到”rohem”,”rohamad”(爱心),但在回教徒之中却没有平等,他们都不善待女性。妇女往往生下八个到十个孩子,然后被丈夫抛弃,成为弃妇。在印度我们有数以千计这样的妇女和儿童,他们成为国家中最贫穷的一群。穆罕默德说:「你们可以和四个女子结婚,好使她们不变成娼妓。那是当时的情况。但现在他们大多变成妓女,她们怎样生活下去呢?他们要以伊斯兰的名义捱饥受冻吗?还要杀害他们的孩子吗?

基督教、回教和犹太教,他们做过甚么好事?我认识一些执掌宗教的人,他们已尽了努力做到最好,但他们必须面对事实。他们并没有达到耶稣基督、穆罕默德或摩西所要求的。相反因为他们的盲目,他们为那些伟大的宗教的开创人带来坏名声,那些伟大的宗教本来是由同一棵灵性之树而来的。

你们都知道,今时今日,美国成为领导者,因为金钱已经成为了上帝。于是美国的文化成为上帝的文化。他们正在剥削你们的国家,但你们却不知道,你们都不明白。我在你们电视上看见那些舶来品的广告,你们疯了吗?你们所有的钱都用来买那些破烂货,那些货物在西方任何一处或美国都是卖不出的。你们那些饱学之士都到西方去洗碗碟。完全没有一点爱国心和牺牲精神。在我的国家,我感到自豪的说,你甚至无法买到一条入口的领带,那是甘地先生的功劳。他说:「不要买任何外国货,你可以买手织的布,比较粗,但不要紧。」我父母为国家牺牲一切,因为他们有爱国心。我也是个爱国的人,我希望你们也这样做。只有通过霎哈嘉瑜伽,才有可能做到。不是靠宣称我是回教徒,我是基督徒,不是这样的。你们要首先说你们是俄国人。你们可以走自己喜欢的道路,但首先要知道自己希望得到甚么。

还有一样事物是充满罪恶和非法的,却被接受,那便是瑞士银行。没有人有甚么批评,他们接受它的存在。我们国家四分之三的钱是锁在里面的,我不知道有多少俄国的黑手党和其他国家的黑手党在里面活动。你们必须用合法的力量攻击他们,因为他们是不合法的。那些钱本来是要给那些贫穷、有病和患了痲疯病的病人的。他们把钱都存进瑞士银行去。我在联合国妇女大会发言时曾呼吁群起攻击瑞士银行,它并没有合法权利存在。

我举我的国家为例,印度是个潜力很大的国家,但三百年来,英国人没有任何入境证便前来,并且定居。他们大肆掠夺,目前的情况是,如果有个印度人要到英国去,他们会仔细检查他。他们夺去我们所有的黄金、钻石、银器和所有有价值的东西,就好像强盗一样。他们自称为基督徒,那也罢了,他们离去时还制造出回教徒和印度人(不单只是印度教徒,因为还有佛教徒、耆那教徒及其他人等之间的问题。那些回教徒说要有他们自己的土地,一如往常那样。他们太执着于土地,回教徒都十分执着,我也不知道为甚么。因此他们夺去了巴基斯坦和孟加拉国。孟加拉国是全世界最贫穷的国家,甚至比乌克兰还要坏得多。现在那些人都偷渡回印度,他们都通过某些方法回到印度。但中国却给予巴基斯坦武器来攻打我们。巴基斯坦的情况是更坏的,因为那些离开印度到巴基斯坦的人,原以为有高官厚禄等着他们,但实际发生的是他们被视为奴隶。印度人是很聪明很狡滑的,巴基斯坦的人发现他们附近有个叫Karachi的港口非常重要。于是他们说要得到这片土地,因为他们在该处已是多数。在一次访问中,那位带头的领袖说,印度的总理就好像希特勒,她每天要杀十四至十六人来减少他们的多数。因此现在是回教徒与回教徒战争。侯赛因和有钱的回教国家战争。库尔德族人和土耳其人战争。这就是回教吗?这就是他们敬奉穆罕默德的方式?那是因为他们没有找到自己的真我,他们还没有知道神。

霎哈嘉瑜伽是唯一可以令你得到自觉(Self-Realization),得到对真我的知识(Slf-Knowledge)的方法。我们有人来自不同宗教、不同的种族,他们许多到过不同的假导师那里去。他们全部都说霎哈嘉瑜伽是唯一可以令他们得到平安的方法。如果你内在没有平安,你怎能将平安给予别人?有些得过和平奖的人脾气很大,十分可怕。他们从来不笑,就好像后面有支鎗指着他们那样。他们也很紧张,这样他们如何将平安给予别人呢?因此第一样要做到的是,必须在内在建立平安。我过去二十五年便是做这样的工作。你不仅得到平安,还可以得到天国的户籍。我上次来俄国时正值政变,但我看见那些霎哈嘉瑜伽的修习者却绝对的平安。我问其中一个说:「你不担心周围所发生的事吗?他们说:「母亲,我们已在天国之中,为甚么还要担心呢?世上的政府常有改换,但我们已经进入了永恒的生命。」你可以从他们的脸上看出,他们没有半点虚伪。

唯有霎哈嘉瑜伽可以给你绝对的知识,而不是相对的知识。相对的知识就好像说:我是个基督徒,因此我高于回教徒,或者说我是个回教徒,因此我高于基督徒。你们看见吗?这是互相竞争的。那是一些僵化的观念,因为你生长在回教家庭,又或者你生长在基督教家庭,这些都是僵化的观念。希特勒便是这方面的表表者。他说他们是一个优秀的种族,真的是一个优秀的种族吗?他们用毒气杀害儿童,而且乐此不疲,他们怎可能是个优秀的种族呢?我们认为比较优秀的是充满慈悲与爱心的圣人。由于我们有顽固的思想在脑袋中,因此我们没有自由,没有勇气去超越那些桎梏我们的思想。同时人类的能量是有限的,思想的能量也是有限的。

如果我说有一个无所不能的能量,为甚么我们不尝试得到它?为甚么我们老是认为自己是基督徒、回教徒或其他甚么的,为甚么我们不追求穆罕默德、耶稣和摩西所描述过的力量?有甚么伤害呢?如果你能得到甚么,为甚么不去得到?而且那是免费的,你毋须付钱。事实上我不需要你们任何东西,我自己已很满足,我也不需要霎哈嘉瑜伽。但我为甚么要东奔西跑呢?那是因为在我之中的那种爱、那种慈悲,使我做这一切事情。因为众人是盲目的,他们不能看见。我不需要有更多的基督教堂,更多的回教寺,更多的犹太教圣殿。我们不需要这类的建筑物。但在人心处是他们永恒的灵。在心中我们要创造平安。神创造了整个灵量的系统,不是我。为甚么神要创造这个系统?是为了最后的突破。灵量是你们每个人的母亲,她要发动起来,她就在那里。这灵量是你们自己的力量。灵量是你们自己的母亲。你们有权利去获得自觉。你们有完全的权利与上天的力量合一,使这个力量流通于你。我们都有这个机制,假如神将我们造成一些工具,但我们却不愿连接至总机去,那你们会变成甚么呢?你们还有甚么去认同呢?我们为甚么要生在世上呢?

现在谈到科学,科学有它的限制。无论他们发现甚么都是科学的范围,但他们能说明为甚么人要生在世上吗?他们能说明进化为甚么会发生吗?他们能说明人类的目的吗?许多问题他们都不能回答。例如你问那些医生,谁使我们的心脏跳动?他们会说是自动神经系统。但这自动者是谁呢?他们就没有答案。我们身体内有acetylcholine和肾上腺。这两种化学物,一增加,一放缓,一增加,一减少。但在身体内,则显得随意,没有人知道为甚么。那些化学物增加、收紧、放松,为甚么?他们能够解释吗?我们知道身体会排斥外来的东西,但当胚胎形成时,却不会被排斥。身体会保留它、养育它,直到适当的时间才把它分娩出来。谁去作出这种分辨呢?那些医生能回答这些问题吗?我们不能说明生命的目的。现在这些科学每天都有新的假设、新的发现。科学家之间竞争得很剧烈。他们互相竞争,但结果造出甚么来呢?是原子弹、氢气弹。因为科学是不谈道德的。科学家都没有道德。他们可以成为间谍,他们可以杀人。他们是科学家,但也可以是醉酒汉,可以是犯了奸淫的人,就好像那些教士一样,毫无分别。他们受到高度尊祟,但却出了甚么问题?他们得过许多奖状,但你却发现他们在道德上很低。这是因为他们不尊重自己。他们不尊重自己是因为他们不知道自己是甚么。他们不知道自己的伟大。这是所有人类的问题,他们不知道自己是谁。我们不是这个身体、这个思维,我们不是这个头脑和情绪。我们不是这个自我、宗教的制约或其他甚么,我们都是纯洁的灵。

我现在要告诉你们,成为纯洁的灵之后会怎样。我想没有人会反对,因为这是为了你们的好处,为了你们家庭的好处,为了你们国家的好处,也是为了全世界的好处。因此请仔细的听我说。我们内在都有这个灵性的力量(Kundalini)。这是印度很古老的科学。在古兰经称为阿萨斯(Asas)。圣经说:「我将如火舌般在你面前显现。」真实是你们必须自己经验的,你们不必对我有盲目的信心。盲目的信仰已引起够多的问题。你们要去经验它,经验这个灵量升起并穿透你们的头盖骨。于是你们便连接到无所不在的,上天浩爱的力量去。这不是演讲,不是传道,这是真正实现你的洗礼。

如果你是聪明的,你会明白我们不是生活在一个很和平的世界。得到自觉后,第一样发生在你身上的是你进入无思无虑的觉醒状态。当我们思考时,我们不是想着将来,便是过去,无法处于现在。现在才是真实。过去已经完结,将来并不存在。可是我们却不能处于现在,这是个事实。一个思潮升起,然后降下,另一个思潮升起,然后降下,而我们则处于过去和现在这些思潮起伏中间。但当灵量升起以后,她拉开了这些思想,在中间创造了一个空隙,那便是当下此刻,在当下此刻,你没有了那种反射的思维,你得到彻底的平安。你是有知觉的,绝对有知觉,但你没有思想。心理学家容格也谈过一点点,我不能称他是个全面的霎哈嘉瑜伽修习者,但他确曾反对那个可怕的弗罗伊德。得到自觉以后,你变得绝对的平安。当你连接上这个无所不在的力量,它是完全平安的,完全没有冲突,喜乐便开始流进你的心,而你向周围散播平安。你使他人获得平安,你会抛弃那些不是真实的观念。你知道了一件事:神是平安的泉源。这样你才能散播平安。在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你会在成千上万坐在一起的人中间找到这种平安。他们可以属于任何国家,可以属于任何种族,但当他们在一起时,就好像一个海洋一样。这不是凭空想象,因为你们变成是整体的一个部分,滴水变成了汪洋。他们互相欣赏,他们从不争斗,因为他们都是纯洁的灵。

另一样发生在你身上的好事,是你的注意力变得受到启发。你们可能全都比我年轻,今年我七十三,快七十四岁了。大多数到了这个年纪的人都会变得精神疲弱,因为他们的注意力变得如此。要改变他们也很困难。但你们的注意力会受到启发。通过受启发的注意力,首先你会看见万物的一体。而且你的注意力会受到爱和慈悲的启发,你会看见他人的好处,而且乐意帮助那些需要你帮助的人。我必须告诉你们我初来俄国的经验,我不懂得俄国任何一种语言,谁来帮助我呢?是德国人,是二十五个德国人,那些德国的霎哈嘉瑜伽修习者初次来帮助我时,眼泪从他们的眼睛流出来。我说:「你们怎样来到这里?」他们说:「母亲,德国人曾杀过那么多俄国人,杀了那么多人,我们不是有责任来到这里吗?」你们看这种爱心,只有你成为纯洁的灵才有可能。这不是一场演讲,或是传道。

第二样发生在你注意力之上的是,你的注意力给你正确的途径。一夜之间,许多人抛弃了毒品、酒精和各种毁灭性的事物。通过霎哈嘉瑜伽,你能享受一切而不会自我毁灭。你享受自然界的一切,你享受所有人。你享受所有内在的宗教,我再次强调,是内在的,而不是表面的。所有这些你都可以得到,是属于你自己的,你应该要去得到。

这个注意力是很有力量的。昨天他们对我说:「母亲,列宁格勒将会很冷很冷。」我告诉那些霎哈嘉瑜伽修习者说:「尽管运用你们的注意力,太阳会为你们服务。」结果昨天阳光普照。你们可以命令大自然这样做,整个自然界都在你们莲足之下,因为你们已经与上天的力量合一。这个上天的力量创造了季节,创造了一切。这个力量创造了你,这个力量创造了你们全体。有甚么对你好的,这个力量都会为你去做,不会做对你不好的事。当然,如果你想某人应该死掉,这个力量不会帮你,但在得到自觉,成为纯洁的灵以后,你也不会想那些坏事情。

另一样十分重要发生在你们身上的是,无论你将注意力放在甚么人身上,你甚至可以给他们自觉。就好像一枝点亮了的蜡烛,可以点亮其他许多成千上万的蜡烛一样。我还没有到过非洲,但在南非喀墨隆及其他许多地方,已经有许多霎哈嘉瑜伽修习者。我还没有到过西伯利亚,但那里已经有许多霎哈嘉瑜伽修习者。

现在霎哈嘉瑜伽正在传播,那些反对它的人很快会离开。人们会知道他们是伪君子,我们不必担心,他们会自动地暴露出来。我们不要对任何人有偏见,我们不要咒诅任何人。我们不要杀害任何人,霎哈嘉修习者不要杀害任何人。在巴西那里的人告诉我,霎哈嘉瑜伽练习者都极之诚实。

跟着你会开始将自觉给予别人...另一阶段是无疑惑的知觉状态。你对霎哈嘉瑜伽没有怀疑,对我没有怀疑,对霎哈嘉瑜伽的运作没有怀疑,对自己没有怀疑。你们都要达到那个阶段。你们国家有许多已经达到那个阶段。在西方人或者白皮肤的人当中,俄国人对灵性是最敏感的。他们不像那些美国人,我发现那些美国人都是十分愚蠢的。我的意思是你们不可能明白他们,他们真的十分愚蠢。

我给你们举个例子,有个容格学会的主席,他至少大我二十年。那时我差不多六十岁。我告诉他们容格犯了甚么错误,他们都认为很对。这位主席来见我,拿着手杖不断抖颤。他说:「我有个私人的问题。」我说:「有甚么问题?」他说:「我是个天主教徒,有一个情妇。由于我是天主教徒,我不能跟她结婚,也不能离婚。」他说:「天主教徒不能有情妇,也不能离婚。」他也没有将事情告诉现在已经死去的太太。现在他很希望跟那位情妇结婚。我问他:「那你的情妇多大哪?」他说:「只有三十五岁。」我十分震惊,她的年纪当得他的孙女。我说:「那你想我怎样帮你忙呢?」他说:「你最好能在她心中放入一种感觉,让她认为应该要嫁给我,这个年纪八十,混身抖颤的老先生竟然向我要求这样的祝福。我对他说:「先生,对不起,我不能为你这样做。」他是国际容格学曾的主席,却要求这样愚蠢的事情。因此有甚么老人要见我,我都说不,对不起。年青人比较好些,因为那些老人家脑袋里还有许多愚蠢的念头,他们想我帮他们做那些愚蠢的事。我告诉你们,如果他们到耶稣基督那里去,耶稣基督肯定曾狠狠教训他们,如果他们到穆罕默德那里去,穆罕默德也会教训他们。这些愚蠢的人想要统冶全世界,如何可能呢?

你们俄罗斯人都是有智慧的人。你们有伟大的传统。印度一直以来没有侵略过其他国家。成吉思汗来到侵略我们,我们饱受侵略。但在灵性上印度人所知很多,他们知道灵量(kundalini)。他们没有追求物质,他们希望得到解脱(Moksha),得到自觉。当然我们也有一些坏分子,但人人都清楚他们是甚么。我十分尊重俄罗斯人,并爱他们。因为他们从来没有听过灵量,他们如何能这样实时接受呢?在他们里面所追求的是甚么?对这微妙的东西怀有甚么爱和暸解?世上很少人像你们这样。

现在是最后的审判,那些人要错失的,始终也会错失。耶稣基督曾说:「你们呼我基督,基督,但我不会承认你们。」要明白你们要成为永恒的灵,正如基督所说:「你们要得到重生。」你们才能对我有信心,或没有信心。这并不要紧。首先你们要对自己的真我有信心,当你在灵性上升进以后,便会更好。我不会告诉你们我是谁。我绝不会告诉你们我是谁。耶稣基督是神的儿子,你们可能会否认,但他确实是。但当耶稣基督这样说时,那些愚蠢的人便把他钉上十字架,因此我不会告诉你们我是谁,当然我不是个普通人。无论我是甚么,我就是我,对我毫无分别。但我不会告诉你们。你们先要在灵性上升进,才能知道,才能明白。为甚么?因为你们要为他人的好处着想:由于你们的无知,你们可能会妨碍其他人的进步。这是一项多大的责任,你们要肩负多么美丽的责任。

最后你们进入上帝的国,沉浸在喜乐的海洋之中。喜乐并没有二重性,像快乐或不快乐,喜乐是一元的。你抛弃了你的欲念与贪婪,变得无所执着,并且开始看见自己的真我。你们不必成为苦行僧;你们不必到喜玛拉雅山去,你们不必禁食。这是内在的,在外面没有甚么需要改变。我知道很快会有一个全球性的改变。甚至你们的遗传基因库也开始改变了。各式各样的人都来到霎哈嘉瑜伽,得到改变。有许多人的病都被治好了,连那些不治之症,不用付钱也被治好了,而且是通过他们自己的力量,一切都是很容易的,自然而然的。甚至给那些动物也可以,如果你将能量给予那些植物,它们会长得好十倍。因此在这最后审判的日子,一种新的人类会被创造。这是属于你自己的,这是你自己的力量。你不仅知道知己的光荣,你自己的伟大。你变得绝对自由,因为你得到那最高的智慧。在灵性之光下,你知道甚么是对你好,你知道绝对的知识。

在这次短短的演讲,有许多事情不能告诉你们。有一件事我想请求那些执掌宗教的人,他们已将人类带到一定的高度,他们已通过不同的阶段,但这是为了甚么呢?为甚么要有宗教呢?那是为了人类的升进,他们必须向上升进,要有宗教来建立那种平衡。就好像飞机要进入不同的工场修理,才得到平衡,然后才能起飞。如果只是平衡却不起飞,那有甚么用?因此你们都要起飞。纯洁的灵是自由的,你不必说不要这样,不要那样。你们都要起飞,享受完全的自由。在这次短短的演讲,无论我说甚么都是从心而发的。所有人都认为霎哈嘉瑜伽在这个国家的发展是个奇迹。霎哈嘉瑜伽解决了他们各种各样的问题,甚至是物质的问题。

愿神祝福你们。

What about asking the questions?

[speaks aside]

I’m also a communist.

[Question: “Are you the Holy Spirit?”]

Write it down and give it Me please.

[.Are you Holy Spirit...?]

Now, I’ve already told you that I’m not going to say anything about it. I’ve already told. Now, if I say, why should you believe – blind faith? After Realization you’ll know everything. I don’t want to get crucified.

[aside]

You see, let them discover, it’s the point. You can not force anything. Only thing you have to be honest people.

[aside]

Thank you, thank you very much.

[aside]

There was one question, “What is the purpose of human life?” The purpose of human life is to enter into the Kingdom of God. Is to enjoy the bounties of God Almighty. The purpose is to become the Spirit so that there is complete peace, harmony and pure joy. That is the role of God also. This another question.

Mr. Roerich [a famous Russian painter who lived in India] went to, definitely he went to this gentleman to get some kind of a Buddhism. He was, himself, a very good man, but I don’t know why he got allurement with this kind of a Buddhism. Is another kind of religion, which has not helped anyone. Buddha has talked about compassion, compassion and compassion. And the Japanese are the greatest Buddhists. So you can see what sense is it. Compassion – Japanese are only doing their business. Buddhism has not entered into their mind. Like any other religion, only after knowing yourself it will happen. We have horrible cults in Japan under the name of Buddha.

I went to Canada and there was one fellow who came in the orange dress and I asked him, “Why are you wearing this orange dress?” So he said that “This is the only dress left now to me. I was a very rich man. All other money, everything is gone to Mr. Dalai Lama.” He’s a great beggar and I was surprised that in the West people like if you beg money from them. In Boston they asked. “Many, how many Rolls Royces I had?” I said, “I have none. I only have one car that my husband has.” So they said, “You are not in the business?” I said, “No.” They said, “We don’t care for you. Get out.” That’s American style. So this Dalai Lama has accumulated so much money. He has come in our country. No one likes him, but he is sitting on our heads. He’s very fond of gold. He tells people, “You take sanyasa. You become ascetic. Give all your money to me”, like all other false gurus.

Buddha has failed, Christ has failed, Mohammed-sahib has failed because people never understood them. They were too great for human mind. So the first thing I did was to study human beings for about forty-seven years of My age and I saw how complicated they were and then I found out this method of en masse Realization. There were many Sufis who got Realization. There were many Saints in India who got Realization, but very, very few. Also, among Christians, there were some who got Realization – Kahlil Gibran. But they were all tortured.

So we have to say now, to understand them also, you have to have your self knowledge. They’re all making money in the name of these great founders of religion or they’re spreading poison. In Mecca there were thousands and thousands of Muslims and there was one fellow from Sudan. He was black, absolutely jet black, and he was spreading poison in the name of Mohammed-sahib. I had somebody close to Me who knew Arabic and I was shocked. And just after that, there was a stampede and thirty-two people, innocent people who had gone for Haj, died in the stampede. You can’t spread a poison in the name of divine people. It is sinful.

Also this gentleman, this painter and his wife, both suffered a lot from physical health.

[“How can achieve good attention?]

You don’t have to do anything because whatever you will do, you’ll do through your mental activity. Mental activity is linear. There’s no truth in it. It goes up to a point, recoils back on it. But the power of Spirit spreads on all sides. [speaks aside] Now they’re asking about attention. It’s very simple, when the Kundalini rises, the attention which is spread out here goes up like this, up. It is brought in the centre. And, at this Sahasrara, it breaks. When it breaks, you see, this whole attention is filled with enlightenment. You don’t have to do anything, but you have to go on raising your Kundalini like this yourself. That’s all. When you watch something, watch something without thinking. Can you watch Me without thinking? Now you can feel the all pervading power in your hands, you’ll see that. This is the namaz, but Muslims don’t know anything. You will feel the cool breeze. This is the all pervading power and on your fingertips you will know about your centers and about the centers of others. All those who have felt cool breeze or hot breeze on their hands or out of their fontanelle bone area raise your hands. So, all of you have felt it. So simple because you are ready and because you’re Russians. May God bless you.

Now we have centers here and we have doctors and we have people here who know how to cure you. You can go to these centers [tell them] and get cured and you can also cure others. One thing I’ve seen, Russians in a huge crowd of sixteen, eighteen thousand people, they told Me they got cured in the program. Only possible in Russia, not even in India. I respect you very much. I don’t know of what metal you are made.

[“There is a central charity Christian Orthodox fund, Shri Mataji. They want to cooperate with Sahaja Yoga.]

Oh, I’m very happy. Now Central Charity Christian Orthodox Fund wants to cooperate with Sahaja Yoga. Thank you very much. Thank you. That’s what I said they are wise. They are very wise people in this country. They will not stand in the way where they see that people are helped. For no rhyme and reason they will object to Sahaja Yoga. Thank you very much. I would like to thank.

[aside]

Some Sahaja Yogini has written to Me. ‘llI go home and read the whole thing and I’ll answer them.... answer them in the program, all right. It’s a very big question.

[“Shri Mataji, do you have a good opinion about Mikhail Gorbachev? What do you think about him now?]

It’s all again political business. I don’t want to say anything about Gorbachev. I think he fell into the trap of these Americans or something. I don’t know what to say. I have all respect for him. But somehow he never wanted to meet Me. I tried. It’s all right.

[“What is the attitude to the husband?”]

The question is there about the women, they want to know my attitude towards the husband.

[“Sorry, Shri Mataji, Moonies” – unclear]

What a question. My goodness. You please don’t ask Me about devils.

[“If each and every person could be a Sahaja Yogi?”]

The question is if each and every person could be a Sahaja Yogi. Yes, of course. But say he’s an idiot. He’s stupid. He has fixed ideas. What else – who’s arrogant. You see if your one foot is in the mouth of the crocodile and put one foot in the boat, what should we do?

[“Shri Mataji, please say how to tell about sects, about false gurus. How we Sahaja Yogis have to talk about sects?”]

Sahaja Yogis have to talk about how they should talk about the false gurus. You see those people who have been to false gurus are already suffering. They could be even quite mad. For example, I went to Chicago and there was one fellow of the Hare Rama Hare Krishna. He was the Chairman of Chicago Hare Rama Hare Krishna. It was very cold and he was wearing the dhoti you know this common in India, very thin. And he had shaved his hair and with a pony tail, a little bit like that coming out. I said, “Sir, I’m a Mother, why are you wearing this dhoti in this cold weather? It’s very cold you know, I’m shivering.” He said, “My guru has told me that if you wear a dhoti, you’ll get moksha, nirvana.” I said, “What? In My country eighty percent wear this thing, so they’d be there already.” He had shaved his hair.

I said, “Why did you shave your hair?” He said, “That my guru has told me that that’s the station to get into the heaven.” He was American, you see. I said, “There is Kabir, a great poet in India, said that by shaving your head if you can get your place in heavens, then what about the sheep that is shaved two times every year. Those sheep must be already there. Where will you have the place?” So he got very angry with Me. “You’re talking against my guru.” I said, “See, you need not be angry with Me. Do what you like, your guru has said, but tomorrow if you get sick with this dhoti don’t come to Me.” This “Hare Rama Hare Krishna” we say everyday in India. We don’t say good morning like the English. We say, “Hare Ram,” just like the Muslims say something, “Allah.” So we say the same way. It’s just a lip service. How can you go to heaven. He got angry but then he developed varicose veins. Next year he came to Me. So, to deal with them, you have to be careful. Firstly, they are slaves of their gurus. They have fixed ideas. Some of them just start shaking before Me. They fall in the ground. But most of them now are finished.

First thing they mesmerize. We have one in India who used to mesmerize and bring out Swiss watches to give to people. Lastly, there were very great people from India went to see him. There were four cameras. He could not mesmerize the camera. So the cameras clearly showed how he brought a necklace and passed it on. And also our rich people in India are so stupid – rich not the poor. They used to go to him to get diamonds, can you imagine. I mean all kinds of tricks he did. But he was exposed by newspapers now. They’re all getting exposed by God’s grace. All falsehood will get exposed. Firstly if you tell them that you don’t have to pay any money to the guru, all the gurus will jump in the sea.

[“Is it possible for people who are not realized to feel the vibrations in your presence?”]

You see those who are not realized can not feel any vibrations, even in My presence.

[Answering a written question:] Then she’s saying that how is it that the people do not accept or recognize that it is You and only You who is the Holy Ghost? They are asking Me again and again the same question. But I must tell you about Russians. First time, when I came to Leningrad nobody had heard about Me. Nobody had seen Me. There were only some advertisements in the newspaper with My face. I also look like Russians sometimes and, you know, they saw only My face in the newspaper and when I went for the program the whole place was filled already, two thousand people and two thousand were waiting outside. I was surprised. I went inside and people got their Realization and when I came out they were still sitting. They said, “Mother, what about us?” I said, “All right, you come tomorrow. We’ll sit outside in the open.” It was very sunny and there were two thousand from outside and two thousand from inside and two thousand more, six thousand people. I was amazed. They all got their Realization. I said, “How did you come to My program?” They were not realized souls. They said, “Mother, Your face, it’s absolutely evident. We know who You are.” I was surprised. That’s why I praise Russians very much. They are sensitive to truth. They are sensitive to spirituality. Maybe last lives they must have done lot of good things. I just don’t know, but I find Russians extremely sensitive.

Another are Romanians, compared to all other Western countries. I’ll tell you a joke. In Tagliatti there was a joke that a Tagliatti fellow asked an American, “How many Sahaj Yogis you have in America?” So he said, “Fifty-six.” He said, “You have Fifty-six thousand. We have only twenty-one thousand in Tagliatti.” We had to hold the meeting in jungles near Volga River, because there were so many. Very sweet, very sweet, very sweet, I don’t know how to express Myself for your love and understanding. Here I talked to scientists. There were two hundred fifty scientists sitting. They said, “Don’t tell us about science. Tell us about God’s science. We have had enough of science.” Just think of it, such beautiful people like the flowers about to become the fruits. No credit for Me. I go to all the countries, sixty-five countries. Among all of them, you are so special. I don’t know, when I leave you I feel somebody is wrenching My Heart. May God bless you.

[“If there are chakras above Sahasrara?”]

There are chakras above Sahasrara, but first of all establish yourself. Gradually everything will work out.

[“What is to be attitude to the members of the family who are not Sahaja Yogis?”]

My family members were not Sahaja Yogis to begin with. My husband used to say, “I know You are a Saint, but You can not transform others. You are moral, but You can’t make others moral.” Now he’s changed. He said, “I’ve seen all this happening. You’ve made them into angels. I have to be honest that You have done the job.” Even now, My daughters, My grandchildren, everyone in My family, husband’s family, My mother’s family, they believe in Sahaja Yoga. But I would say that I showed all compassion, love and patience. But I would say they are not great Sahaja Yogis like Russians, but they will be. Also it’s better to keep them out because Sahaja Yogis make such a fuss out of them which will spoil their chances. They should come to Sahaja Yoga like ordinary people, otherwise it will be like nepotism I don’t want that.

[“Mother, please tell us how to overcome the daily suffering of how making enough money to pay for the food.”]

Now she’s asking how to make sufficient money to have the food. After coming to Sahaja Yoga, many people have solved their financial problems completely. How? First their attention becomes so good, that they can do many things which they could never do before and the blessings of the Divine start pouring on them. You have to have faith in yourself that you are Sahaja Yogis and you’ll be amazed so many things will happen. Such coincidences that you’ll be amazed at yourself.

I give you two examples of a miracle. There was a girl, young girl, who got frustrated because she didn’t do well or something and she shot herself on the stomach on the left hand side and the bullet came out from here from the right arm. Also there was some blood, but she was quite conscious. So they took her to the hospital. Doctors were surprised. They x-rayed her, did everything and found that the bullet did not touch any nerve, any muscle, anything. Doctors said as if the bullet had a stroll around. Nobody could explain it. She came out of hospital second day.

Another miracle, recent, I mean recent one, there was a lady who’s son was in America and who got into a horrible disease which is in her family at a very young age. Normally, they get it in the old age. She was working in the UN. She wrote to Me three letters praying that, “Mother, please cure my son. He’s so young and he’ll die within a month’s time.” And the fourth letter came from her, that he’s all right, nothing is wrong with him. I didn’t do anything – this All Pervading Power.

Another is another Sahaja Yogini in Turkey was thinking that her husband is not well employed in Turkey as a pilot and just out of the blue he got a job in Germany and now in America, a very big job. I don’t do anything. I am the laziest person.

[“What can save Russia?”]

I’ve already told you, you have to be patriotic. This is another revolution. You have to sacrifice and you have to understand not to waste your money on these Western nonsensical things. And Divine help will come to you. So many Sahaja Yogis who dare touch you, you’re all protected by the Divine. What else?

[“Shri Mataji, one of the symbols with Denmark is the elephant. Will Sahaja Yoga be established in Denmark?”]

If they’re asking if Sahaja Yoga will go to Denmark because the symbol is the, what you call, the elephant. Sahaja Yoga in Denmark will move likes elephant only, I think.

[“Will there be other incarnations on the Earth?”]

They’re asking about incarnations, will there be incarnations and all of that. Why do you worry about all these things. I can’t tell you.

[“I want to know about these big problems .... China”

He wants to know about China? You shouldn’t mind if I say that we couldn’t start Sahaja Yoga there in that way because still they’re communists. But I’m sure the government of China will accept it very soon and then we can start Sahaja Yoga in a big way. Chinese are other very ancient people, very wise. Culturally, they are like Indians. They have morality in them. One thing I noticed, they were extremely hospitable, kind and gentle. You saw people there who were from Germany, from Africa, from America. They looked so gross. But Chinese, you know, they had arranged, through their students, the volunteers, very well trained girls and boys and so gentle. They were paid nothing. They are very patriotic people one has to learn from them. I wish Indians were like that. They are very dignified, very well mannered. Of course, if you insult them, they don’t like. I must admit that Indians did that, insult them. And art, what art they have. Their government doesn’t allow much to come inside China. They also don’t care much for the Western culture. They dress up just like Chinese, most of them.

Moreover, they’re very learned. They had two great philosophers, but the greatest was Lao Tze, who talked about Kundalini, Realization, everything. Confucius talked about humanity. So they believe in Confucius because it suits communism. In Hong Kong there are many Chinese and I asked them what will you do when the Hong Kong goes to the China, mainland China? They said, “We are Chinese and we’ll be with mainland China. What does it matter? We’re not going to run away.” And do you know how they became rich? So many Chinese have gone abroad. And after this episode of killing the young students they were angry, but when it was explained that how can you suddenly give freedom to these young boys, students. One can do it gradually.

Otherwise, like Russia, there will be problem of mafia. They are very wise. So the Chinese who are abroad understood and the Chinese abroad send fifty to sixty percent of their income to their government. They are not attached to money. That’s how they have become rich, very dedicated. Thousands and thousands of people are there, but the system that they have built, so beautiful that nobody will start playing. I was amazed that while working nobody drank anything, even a drop, so very alert. But when we were coming by that plane first class all the ladies and men were drinking vodka, vodka, bottles after bottles. I got a headache. Chinese are ashamed to do such a thing. Also they have told Me that the Chinese men marry Russian women and then give it up and call the Chinese women. I tell you, Chinese women are really very sweet. They don’t compete with men. They are very sweet and they win over men with their sweetness. I also know they are very sensitive to spirituality. Even their prime minister asked Me about spirituality when I went with my husband. And I’m sure one day you’ll find your brothers and sister very closely in China.

I hope I’ve been able to answer most of your questions. I thank the organizers of this conference from My Heart.

[“Many questions about how to give up drinking Shri Mataji?”]

When you get your Self-Realization, in the light of Spirit, you give up everything which is destructive. How? I’ll give an example. Supposing I’m very obstinate and I have a snake in my hand and there is darkness and you tell Me there is snake in your hand. I will say, “No, it’s a rope.” But when the light will come, immediately I will throw it away. In the same way, not only you give up drinking, that’s not the only thing you do, but you give up everything that is bad for you. Because you also become very strong and free. Nothing can attack you, no habits. All drop out.
